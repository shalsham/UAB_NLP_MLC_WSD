20466110,"Splenectomy leads to a persistent hypercoagulable state after trauma.BACKGROUND: It was hypothesized that splenectomy following trauma results in hypercoagulability. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized, single-center study was performed to evaluate coagulation parameters in trauma patients with splenic injury. RESULTS: Patients with splenectomy (n = 30) and nonoperative management (n = 50) were enrolled. Splenectomy patients were older, had higher Injury Severity Scores, and had longer intensive care unit and hospital stays (P &lt; .05). Splenectomy patients had significantly increased white blood cell counts and <e>platelet</e> counts at baseline and follow-up (P &lt; .01). Fibrinogen was initially elevated in both groups and remained elevated in the splenectomy group (P &lt; .05). Tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and activated partial thromboplastin time were higher in splenectomy patients only at baseline (P &lt; .05). Baseline thromboelastography showed faster fibrin cross-linking and enhanced fibrinolysis following splenectomy (P &lt; .05). Only clot strength was greater at follow-up in the splenectomy group (P &lt; .01). Deep venous thrombosis developed in 7% of splenectomy patients and no control patients (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: A significant difference in deep venous thrombosis formation was noted, and coagulation assays indicated persistent hypercoagulability following splenectomy for trauma.",M1
20465840,"Prevalence and risk factors for significant liver fibrosis among HIV-monoinfected patients.BACKGROUND: HIV-monoinfected patients may be at risk for significant liver fibrosis, but its prevalence and determinants in these patients are unknown. Since HIV-monoinfected patients do not routinely undergo liver biopsy, we evaluated the prevalence and risk factors of significant hepatic fibrosis in this group using the aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-<e>platelet</e> ratio index (APRI). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among HIV-infected patients negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody in the Penn Center for AIDS Research Adult/Adolescent Database. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from the database at enrollment. Hypothesized determinants of significant fibrosis were modifiable risk factors associated with liver disease progression, hepatic fibrosis, or hepatotoxicity, including immune dysfunction (i.e., CD4 T lymphocyte count &lt;200 cells/mm(3), HIV viremia), diseases associated with hepatic steatosis (e.g., obesity, diabetes mellitus), and use of antiretroviral therapy. The primary outcome was an APRI score &gt;1.5, which suggests significant hepatic fibrosis. Multivariable logistic regression identified independent risk factors for significant fibrosis by APRI. RESULTS: Among 432 HIV-monoinfected patients enrolled in the CFAR Database between November 1999 and May 2008, significant fibrosis by APRI was identified in 36 (8.3%; 95% CI, 5.9-11.4%) patients. After controlling for all other hypothesized risk factors as well as active alcohol use and site, detectable HIV viremia (adjusted OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.02-8.87) and diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.12-10.10) remained associated with significant fibrosis by APRI. CONCLUSIONS: Significant fibrosis by APRI score was found in 8% of HIV-monoinfected patients. Detectable HIV viremia and diabetes mellitus were associated with significant fibrosis. Future studies should explore mechanisms for fibrosis in HIV-monoinfected patients.",M1
20450128,"Respiratory syncytial virus-positive bronchiolitis in hospitalized infants is associated with thrombocytosis.BACKGROUND: Secondary thrombocytosis is associated with a variety of clinical conditions, one of which is lower respiratory tract infection. However, reports on thrombocytosis induced by viral infections are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To assess the rate of thrombocytosis (<e>platelet</e> count &gt; 500 x 10(9)/L) in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis and to investigate its potential role as an early marker of respiratory syncytial virus infection. METHODS: Clinical data on 469 infants aged &lt; or = 4 months who were hospitalized for bronchiolitis were collected prospectively and compared between RSV-positive and RSV-negative infants. RESULTS: The rate of thrombocytosis was significantly higher in RSV-positive than RSV-negative infants (41.3% vs. 29.2%, P=0.031). The odds ratio of an infant with bronchiolitis and thrombocytosis to have a positive RSV infection compared to an infant with bronchiolitis and a normal platelet count was 1.7 (P= 0.023, 95% confidence interval 1.07-2.72). There was no significant difference in mean platelet count between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: RSV-positive bronchiolitis in hospitalized young infants is associated with thrombocytosis.",M1
20433382,"Effects of lithium carbonate on carboplatin-induced thrombocytopenia in dogs.OBJECTIVE: To describe the effects of lithium carbonate on thrombopoiesis in clinically normal dogs and in dogs treated with carboplatin. ANIMALS: 18 young adult sexually intact female Beagles. PROCEDURES: Dogs were assigned to each of 3 treatment groups (6 dogs/group). Group 1 received 150 mg of lithium carbonate (14 to 16 mg/kg), PO, every 12 hours on days 1 through 21. Group 2 received carboplatin (300 mg/m(2), IV) on day 0 and cephalexin (30 mg/kg, PO, q 12 h) on days 14 through 21. Group 3 received lithium, carboplatin, and cephalexin at the aforementioned doses and schedules. Plasma lithium and blood <e>platelet</e> concentrations were measured on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, and 21. Number of megakaryocytes in bone marrow specimens and the percentage of large unstained cells and CD34+ mononuclear cells in bone marrow aspirates were determined on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 by manual enumeration, automated hematologic analysis, and flow cytometric immunophenotyping, respectively. RESULTS: Plasma lithium concentrations ranged from 0.12 to 2.41 mmol/L. All dogs given lithium achieved a concentration within the target interval of 0.5 to 1.5 mmol/L by days 4 to 7. Thrombopoiesis was increased in dogs receiving lithium alone. All dogs given carboplatin developed mild thrombocytopenia. There were no differences between group 2 and group 3 throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Lithium stimulated thrombopoiesis in clinically normal dogs. Lithium administration at the doses and schedules used, with concurrent administration of cephalexin, did not prevent thrombocytopenia induced by carboplatin.",M1
20431066,"Restoration of high-density lipoprotein levels by cholesteryl ester transfer protein expression in scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) knockout mice does not normalize pathologies associated with SR-BI deficiency.OBJECTIVE: Disruption of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) in mice impairs high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (HDL-C) delivery to the liver and induces susceptibility to atherosclerosis. In this study, it was investigated whether introduction of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) can normalize HDL-C transport to the liver and reduce atherosclerosis in SR-BI knockout (KO) mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Expression of human CETP in SR-BI(KO) mice resulted in decreased plasma HDL-C levels, both on chow diet (1.8-fold, P&lt;0.001) and on challenge with Western-type diet (1.6-fold, P&lt;0.01). Furthermore, the presence of CETP partially normalized the abnormally large HDL particles observed in SR-BI(KO) mice. Unexpectedly, expression of CETP in SR-BI(KO) mice did not reduce atherosclerotic lesion development, probably because of consequences of SR-BI deficiency, including the persistence of higher VLDL-cholesterol (VLDL-C) levels, unchanged elevated free cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio, and the increased oxidative status of the animals. In addition, CETP expression did not normalize other characteristics of SR-BI deficiency, including female infertility, reticulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and impaired <e>platelet</e> aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: CETP restores HDL-C levels in SR-BI(KO) mice, but it does not change the susceptibility to atherosclerosis and other typical characteristics that are associated with SR-BI disruption. This may indicate that the pathophysiology of SR-BI deficiency is not a direct consequence of changes in the HDL pool.",M1
20404751,"The association of oxidant status and antioxidant capacity in children with acute and chronic ITP.PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to investigate oxidant and antioxidant systems in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). With this purpose, we measured the levels of serum malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS), and other oxidative stress parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two pediatric patients with ITP (25 acute, 27 chronic) and 21 healthy children were included in the study. Patients with acute ITP were studied, before and after, methylprednisolone treatment. RESULTS: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, <e>platelet</e> count, and TAC were statistically significantly lower in patients with acute ITP before treatment than those in the control group (P&lt;0.05). In addition, in this group, MDA, TOS levels, and OSI (oxidative stress index) were found to be higher than those in the control group. In chronic ITP group, although hemoglobin hematocrit, platelet counts, and TAC levels were statistically significantly lower than those in the control groups,the mean platelet volume, MDA, TOS, and OSI were found to be statistically significantly higher (P&lt;0.05). Platelet count and mean platelet volume values were statistically significantly lower in patients with acute ITP before treatment than after treatment (P&lt;0.05). We also found a positive correlation between thrombocyte count and TAC, in patients with acute ITP before treatment (r: 0.601, P&lt;0.001) and acute ITP after treatment (r: 0.601, P&lt;0.001) and chronic ITP (r: 0.601, P&lt;0.001). A negative correlation was found between thrombocyte count and serum MDA levels, in patients with acute ITP before treatment (r: -0.356, P&lt;0.001) and acute ITP after treatment (r: -0.356, P&lt;0.001) and chronic ITP (r: -0.356, P&lt;0.001). We also found a negative correlation between thrombocyte count and serum OSI, in patients with acute ITP before treatment (r: -0.494, P&lt;0.001) and acute ITP after treatment (r: -0.494, P&lt;0.001) and chronic ITP (r: -0.494, P&lt;0.001). A negative correlation was found between thrombocyte count and TOS, in patients with acute ITP before treatment (r: -0.470, P&lt;0.001) and acute ITP after treatment (r: -0.470, P&lt;0.001) and chronic ITP (r: -0.470, P&lt;0.001). In conclusion, increased MDA, TOS and OSI, and decreased TAC levels were found in patients with acute and chronic ITP. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these findings, we suggest that free oxygen radicals may have an effect on the structural and functional damage of platelets, and on the mechanism of thrombocytopenia in both, acute and chronic ITP.",M1
20403480,"Relation between C-reactive protein, homocysteine levels, fibrinogen, and lipoprotein levels and leukocyte and <e>platelet</e> counts, and 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease among healthy adults in the USA.The association between systemic inflammation and the estimated 10-year risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) according to the Framingham risk score is largely unknown. In this study, 6,371 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) aged 40 to 79 years, who had no histories of heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or diabetes mellitus, were categorized into groups at low (&lt;10%), intermediate (10% to 20%), and high (&gt;20%) risk according to 10-year risk for CAD, calculated using the Framingham risk score modified by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. After adjustments for age, gender, race, body mass index, and co-morbidities, participants at high risk were more likely to have elevated circulating C-reactive protein levels (&gt;/=2.2 mg/L: adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30 to 2.01, p &lt;0.0001; &gt;10.0 mg/L: OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.93, p = 0.034). The high-risk group had circulating fibrinogen, homocysteine, leukocyte, and platelet levels that were 20.98 mg/dl (95% CI 12.53 to 29.43, p &lt;0.0001), 1.54 mumol/L (95% CI 0.76 to 2.32, p = 0.002), 0.90 mumol/L (95% CI 0.36 to 1.43, p = 0.001), 910/microl (95% CI 670 to 1,160, p &lt;0.0001), and 10,220/microl (95% CI 2,830 to 17,610, p &lt;0.0001) higher, respectively, than in those in the low-risk group. There was also a dose-dependent increase in circulating levels of inflammatory markers across the categories of CAD risk. In conclusion, these findings indicate that low-grade systemic inflammation and hyperhomocysteinemia were present in participants with high 10-year risk for CAD.",M1
20403469,"Relation of <e>platelet</e> count to bleeding and vascular complications in patients undergoing coronary angiography.Vascular and bleeding complications are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, limited data are available on the relation between these complications and the platelet count in patients undergoing coronary angiography. We, therefore, performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 3,466 consecutive adults undergoing coronary angiography at a single institution during a 2-year period. The mean + or - SD age was 60 + or - 13 years; 58% of the patients were men, 67% were white, and 27% were black. The mean platelet count was 242 + or - 86 x 10(9)/L. A total of 143 bleeding or vascular complications (4.2%), as defined using the American College of Cardiology CathPCI Registry criteria, a part of the American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Disease Registry, occurred. The risk of complications increased with increasing platelet counts. Compared to the quartile with the lowest platelet counts, the odds ratio (OR) for complications was 1.41 for the second quartile (95% confidence interval 0.83 to 2.37, p = 0.20), 1.74 for the third quartile (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.93, p = 0.04), and 2.04 for the fourth quartile (95% confidence interval 1.21 to 3.44, p = 0.008). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, age, percutaneous coronary intervention, and increasing platelet counts were independent predictors of bleeding and vascular complications. When the analysis was limited to the 2,220 patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography without percutaneous coronary intervention, an increasing platelet quartile was a significant predictor of vascular and/or bleeding complications (OR 1.88, p = 0.08; OR 2.48, p = 0.01; OR 2.52, p = 0.01 for the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively). In conclusion, the baseline platelet count was a strong and independent risk factor for bleeding and vascular complications in patients undergoing coronary angiography.",M1
20394870,"Effects of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids on responsiveness to dual antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: the OMEGA-PCI (OMEGA-3 fatty acids after pci to modify responsiveness to dual antiplatelet therapy) study.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are able to modify <e>platelet</e> responsiveness to dual antiplatelet therapy in stable coronary artery disease patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have suggested antiplatelet properties of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, it is unknown whether they can enhance platelet inhibition on standard aspirin and clopidogrel treatment. METHODS: The OMEGA-PCI (OMEGA-3 Fatty Acids After PCI to Modify Responsiveness to Dual Antiplatelet Therapy) study was an investigator-initiated, prospective, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Patients receiving standard dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75 mg/day and clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg/day) were randomly assigned to receive the addition of 1 g of omega-3 ethyl esters (n = 33) or placebo (n = 30) for 1 month. Platelet function was measured serially by light transmission aggregometry (adenosine diphosphate and arachidonic acid [AA] were used as agonists) and assessment of the phosphorylation status of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein at baseline, 12 h, 3 to 5 days, and 30 days after randomization. RESULTS: The P2Y(12) reactivity index was significantly lower, by 22.2%, after 1 month of treatment with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids compared with placebo when used in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy (p = 0.020). Maximal platelet aggregation induced by 5 and 20 micromol/l adenosine diphosphate was lower by 13.3% (p = 0.026) and 9.8% (p = 0.029), respectively, after 1 month of treatment with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids compared with placebo. Platelet aggregation after AA stimulation was low and did not change significantly throughout the study. There were no cases of aspirin resistance during follow-up that was suggestive of good compliance with the medication. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of omega-3 ethyl esters to the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel significantly potentiates platelet response to clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention.",M1
20389314,"Immune thrombocytopaenia in adults: a single-centre retrospective review of patients presenting over 7 years.AIM: To compare the investigation and management of adult immune thrombocytopaenia in our institution with international guidelines. METHOD: Adults presenting with immune thrombocytopaenia over a 7-year period were identified from a database. Written and electronic case records were reviewed. Patient demographics, results of investigations and management were recorded and compared with international guidelines. RESULTS: ITP was mild or asymptomatic in 57 of 67 patients (85%). Bone marrow aspiration was performed in 45 patients including 23 of 45 patients under 60 yrs. 15 patients (22%) were tested for HIV at presentation. 28 patients (42%) were inpatients including 18 patients who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. 53 patients (79%) received first-line treatment with oral prednisone including 6 who were asymptomatic with <e>platelets</e> &gt;30x10(9)/L. Splenectomy was performed in 17 patients at a median 7 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Guidelines were followed in most cases although bone marrow aspirates were often performed unnecessarily in young patients. HIV testing was infrequently requested and should be considered in all new patients presenting with ITP. Asymptomatic patients have a low risk of serious or life-threatening bleeding and do not require admission to hospital. Most patients will eventually achieve a platelet count &gt;30x10(9)/L off treatment.",M1
20386277,"Temporarily pulmonary hilum clamping as a thoracic damage-control procedure for lung trauma in swine.BACKGROUND: Temporarily pulmonary hilum clamping is available for the trauma surgeon to deal with serious pulmonary injuries, but the physiologic influence needs further evaluation. This study was to establish a temporary pulmonary hilum clamping model for thoracic damage-control surgery and determine the safety time latitude of this manipulation. METHODS: After anesthetized and catheter instrumented, the left pulmonary hilus of pigs were clamped with a urethral catheter after thoracotomy maintained for three different time period, 90 minutes (C90), 120 minutes (C120), and 150 minutes (C150), and then unclamped. Hemodynamic data were recorded and serum samples were collected for d-dimer detection and other hematology analysis, as well as 1 cm3 pulmonary tissue was obtained for histologic study before clamping, at the end of clamping, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 4 hours after unclamping. RESULTS: There were 100% of C90, 83.3% of C120, and 33.3% of C150 pigs survived. Animals of C150 group suffered highest blood pressure and heart rate, respiratory index, pulmonary dynamic compliance, and cardiac output. Pulmonary vascular resistance, <e>platelet</e> count, and D-dimer showed minor significant changes between C90 and C120 groups, whereas a marked changes in C150 animals during the study. There were much more serious histologic changes in C150 group compared with C90 and C120 groups. CONCLUSIONS: We established a pulmonary hilum clamping animal model for pulmonary damage investigation. It was determined that 120 minutes was the longest safety time for hilum clamping without lethal pulmonary injury in porcine.",M1
20376727,"Efficacy of neutrophil elastase inhibitor on type A acute aortic dissection.BACKGROUND: Surgery for type A acute aortic dissection (AAD) is associated with a high mortality and incidence of postoperative complications, including acute respiratory failure and coagulopathy. Aim of the study was to investigate the effects of sivelestat on pulmonary function and coagulopathy in patients undergoing surgery for AAD. METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing emergency ascending replacement for AAD were divided into two groups. Group I was administered sivelestat intravenously from the beginning of surgery until extubation. Group II was not treated with sivelestat. The <e>platelet</e> count, antithrombin III (AT III) level, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thrombin time (APTT), and prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) were measured. RESULTS: The postoperative decrease of AT III and the platelet count on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 3 hours later were significantly less in group I. The leukocyte count and the values of CRP, PT, APTT, and PT-INR did not differ significantly between the groups. The duration of mechanical ventilation after surgery tended to be shorter in group I. CONCLUSIONS: Sivelestat significantly reduced the postoperative decreases in AT III and platelet count in patients undergoing emergency surgery for AAD.",M1
20373597,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura at the diagnosis of Hodgkin disease.We describe the case of a 76-year-old male presenting a thrombocytopenia at the diagnosis of Hodgkin disease. Basing on bone marrow biopsy and evolution, we diagnosed an immune thrombocytopenia and treated with intravenous gammaglobulins. The <e>platelet</e> count normalized in a few days under this therapy. Immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) is a rare complication of Hodgkin disease (HD). It seems to be due to the production of antibodies directed against platelet membrane proteins. The patient's and the lymphoma's characteristics are not predictive for it to happen. The evolution of HD is also not influenced by its occurrence. Various treatments (including corticoids and immunomodulating agents) have been tried with different efficiencies.",M1
20335832,"Assessment of allograft fibrosis by transient elastography and noninvasive biomarker scoring systems in liver transplant patients.BACKGROUND: This prospective, monocentric study was designed to assess the efficacy of transient elastography (TE), biochemical tests, and more complex scores in determining fibrosis stage in 157 patients transplanted for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or non-HCV-related liver diseases. METHODS AND RESULTS: The optimal TE cutoff values for HCV patients and non-HCV patients were 4.7 and 5.0 kPa for F&gt; or =1, 7.1 and 7.3 kPa for F&gt; or =2, 10.9 kPa and 9.9 kPa for F&gt; or =3, and 17.3 and 12.6 kPa for F=4, respectively. The corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves for F&gt; or =1, F&gt; or =2, F&gt; or =3, and F=4 were 0.95 and 0.86, 0.89 and 0.85, 0.97 and 0.88, and 0.99 and 0.97 for HCV and non-HCV patients, respectively. On the basis of the logistic regression equation, we created a model (FibroTransplant score) to identify advanced fibrosis (F&gt; or =3). The accuracy of this model was tested in a validation group (n=74). AUROCs for diagnosis of F&gt; or =3 in HCV patients and non-HCV patients of the training group were 0.89 and 0.83 (FibroTransplant score), 0.86 and 0.66 (Benlloch score), 0.81 and 0.71 (aspartate aminotransferase-to-<e>platelet</e> ratio index), 0.80 and 0.77 (Hepascore), 0.79 and 0.70 (FibroTest), 0.78 and 0.71 (FIB-4), 0.75 and 0.60 (Forns index), 0.73 and 0.69 (FibroIndex), and 0.70 and 0.59 (Lok score). Among the validation group, AUROCs of the FibroTransplant score for F&gt; or =3 were 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: TE and the FibroTransplant score can be reliably used for diagnosing advanced fibrosis in transplanted patients.",M1
20232179,"Laboratory indicators for early detection and surgical treatment of vibrio necrotizing fasciitis.BACKGROUND: Vibrio necrotizing fasciitis is a rare and life-threatening soft tissue infection, with fulminant clinical courses and high mortality rates. However, the lack of specific disease characteristics and diagnostic tools during the initial examination may delay diagnosis. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We (1) asked whether the clinical indicators could predict laboratory findings during the initial stage of Vibrio necrotizing fasciitis and (2) determined the relationships between the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score and the diagnosis of Vibrio infection. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 70 patients with 71 episodes of Vibrio necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis. Of the 70 patients, 68 had a history of contact with seawater or raw seafood; 66 had underlying chronic diseases. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (25.7%) died a mean 18.7 days after admission, and 52 patients survived. A systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less at the time of admission to the emergency room was associated with mortality. Patients who died had lower leukocyte counts, segmented leukocyte counts, <e>platelet</e> counts, and serum albumin levels compared with the patients who survived and higher counts of band forms of leukocytes. Only eight patients (11%) who survived had a LRINEC score of 6 or greater. CONCLUSIONS: The LRINEC scoring system is not applicable when treating such a highly lethal disease. We propose that severe hypoalbuminemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and increased banded forms of leukocytes are laboratory risk indicators of necrotizing fasciitis that aid in pointing toward initiation of early surgery and predict a higher risk of death. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III Prognostic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for complete descriptions of levels of evidence.",M1
20231680,"Predicting adverse events in children with fever and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia: the prospective multicenter SPOG 2003 FN study.PURPOSE To develop a score predicting the risk of adverse events (AEs) in pediatric patients with cancer who experience fever and neutropenia (FN) and to evaluate its performance. PATIENTS AND METHODS Pediatric patients with cancer presenting with FN induced by nonmyeloablative chemotherapy were observed in a prospective multicenter study. A score predicting the risk of future AEs (ie, serious medical complication, microbiologically defined infection, radiologically confirmed pneumonia) was developed from a multivariate mixed logistic regression model. Its cross-validated predictive performance was compared with that of published risk prediction rules. Results An AE was reported in 122 (29%) of 423 FN episodes. In 57 episodes (13%), the first AE was known only after reassessment after 8 to 24 hours of inpatient management. Predicting AE at reassessment was better than prediction at presentation with FN. A differential leukocyte count did not increase the predictive performance. The score predicting future AE in 358 episodes without known AE at reassessment used the following four variables: preceding chemotherapy more intensive than acute lymphoblastic leukemia maintenance (weight = 4), hemoglobin &gt; or = 90 g/L (weight = 5), leukocyte count less than 0.3 G/L (weight = 3), and <e>platelet</e> count less than 50 G/L (weight = 3). A score (sum of weights) &gt; or = 9 predicted future AEs. The cross-validated performance of this score exceeded the performance of published risk prediction rules. At an overall sensitivity of 92%, 35% of the episodes were classified as low risk, with a specificity of 45% and a negative predictive value of 93%. CONCLUSION This score, based on four routinely accessible characteristics, accurately identifies pediatric patients with cancer with FN at risk for AEs after reassessment.",M1
20229680,"Coagulation disturbances in paediatric patients with hepatic veno-occlusive disease after stem cells transplantation.INTRODUCTION: Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a life threatening complication after stem cells transplantation (SCT). Its prediction, precise diagnosis and treatment remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our goals were to determine the incidence, outcome and changes in haemostatic parameters in patients with VOD. Also, we tried to determine coagulation disturbances and their practical significance in early diagnosis of such patients. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated all consecutive VOD patients after SCT, aged 3 months to 17 years, from February 2004 to July 2008 treated at the Mother and Child Health Institute of Serbia  Dr Vukan Cupić  (IMD). All patients were diagnosed according to the Seattle criteria. The values of PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, FVIII, AT and vWF were measured on the day prior to the initiation of conditioning regiment and on the days 1, 7 and 14 from the moment of VOD diagnosis. Laboratory testing was performed in the IMD haemostasis laboratory and results were statistically evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period 74 SCT were performed at IMD. VOD developed 11 patients; 10 of 46 were autologous and 1 of 28 allogeneic SCT patients. In our group of patients the incidence of VOD was 14.8%. VOD was classified as mild in 7, moderate in 1 and severe in 3 patients. At the moment of establishing the diagnosis all patients had a significantly increased activity of vWF, FVIII and fibrinogen, and decreased AT. All of them were dependent on <e>platelet</e> transfusions. CONCLUSION: Platelet transfusion dependence suggests coagulation activation with great significance and indicates a possible development of VOD. Our results also suggest that monitoring coagulation parameters levels in the first five days from the establishment of diagnosis may have a significant predictive value for VOD outcome.",M1
20203368,"Alteration of serum thrombopoietin levels in patients with chronic hepatitis C under interferon therapy.Thrombocytopenia is commonly observed during interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Since thrombopoietin (TPO) is the main regulator of thrombopoiesis, thrombocytopenia may partially be due to a reduced TPO generation. Because of the developments of the second generation of TPO mimetic drugs patients with reduced TPO levels should be identified possibly having a benefit by medicinal stimulation of thrombopoiesis. Therefore, <e>platelet</e> count and serum TPO concentration of patients receiving an interferon-alpha therapy were determined.Twelve patients treated with IFN-alpha (daily 10 x 106 IU s.c. for four weeks) in cause of chronic hepatitis C were examined during the first month of therapy. Serum TPO concentration significantly decreased from 80.8+/-48.0 to 34.6+/-24.5 pg/ml (p&lt;0.05, Mann-Whitney test), and platelet count declined from 214,417+/-48,292 to 151,333+/-44,726 platelets/microl. During the following three weeks platelet count remained at a low level, while serum TPO increased to normal range.In conclusion, an interferon treatment causes reduced serum TPO level during the first week of therapy accompanied by decreased platelet count. The reduction in TPO synthesis contributes to the development of thrombocytopenia in patients during interferon therapy.",M1
20200774,"Leptin levels and antihypertensive treatment in preeclampsia.INTRODUCTION: This study was carried out to investigate changes in the plasma leptin concentrations during preeclampsia treatment and to determine whether antihypertensive treatments, aimed at decreasing leptin levels, would improve foetal outcomes. METHODS: A prospective study was undertaken in 57 pregnant women with preeclampsia (37 with mild and 20 with severe preeclampsia) and 46 normal pregnant women who were matched in maternal and gestational age and body mass index. The mild preeclampsia group was treated with alpha-methyldopa, while the severe preeclampsia group was treated with a combination of alpha-methyldopa and nifedipine. RESULTS: The severe preeclampsia group had significantly lower <e>platelet</e> counts, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures and elevated serum uric acid concentrations. Pre-treatment plasma leptin levels were significantly increased in the severe preeclampsia group (range 18.3-49.5) compared to the the mild preeclampsia group (range 20.7-45.4) and normal controls (range 8.6-19.2). Post-treatment plasma leptin levels in both the mild and severe preeclampsia groups (range 10.2-23.5 and 11.3-24.4, respectively) were statistically similar to those of the control group (range 9.1-20.7). Estimated foetal weight, intrauterine growth retardation and demise were statistically similar in the three study groups. CONCLUSION: Plasma leptin concentrations were found to be elevated in women diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. However, the exact mechanism underlying the increased plasma leptin levels in preeclampsia and the functional role of leptin in the development of hypertension need to be further clarified. Leptin has a promising future as a valuable marker to identity women with a high risk for preeclampsia.",M1
20200641,"Vanishing <e>platelets</e>: rapid and extreme tirofiban-induced thrombocytopenia after percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction.Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are established treatment for patients who develop acute coronary syndromes. Thrombocytopenia is known to occur following the administration of various drugs, including heparin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. In the case of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, the mechanism is thought to be drug-dependent antibodies. In most cases, the thrombocytopenia is mild or moderate in severity. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count, &lt;50 x 10(9)/L) is distinctly rare. Herein, we report a case of tirofiban-induced thrombocytopenia in which the overall platelet count dropped precipitously to &lt;1 x 10(9)/L within 12 hours of administration; recovery was relatively prolonged, possibly owing to concomitant renal insufficiency. The severity and the rapidity of onset emphasize the need to routinely check platelet counts early after tirofiban administration, in order to prevent sequelae.",M1
20190717,"Prediction severity of esophageal varices: a new cutoff point for <e>Platelet</e> count/ spleen diameter ratio.AIM: It is currently recommended that all patients with liver cirrhosis undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) to identify those who have esophageal varices (EV) that carry a high risk of bleeding and may benefit from prophylactic measures. In the future, this social and medical burden will increase due to the greater number of patients with chronic liver disease and their improved survival. The aim of this paper was assess value of platelet count/spleen diameter ratio (PC/SD ratio) for the prediction or screening of EV in cirrhotic patients. METHODS: In this two years prospective study, patients with liver cirrhosis referred to Al -Zahra hospital enrolled. Patients underwent detailed clinical examination, blood tests (hematology, liver function tests) and ultrasonography. Size of esophageal varices was assessed at UGIE; Paquet's grades 0-III were classified as group A (0-I; No or Mild EV) and group B (II-III; Moderate to severe EV). PC/SD ratio was also measured as possible noninvasive predictive/screening tools. Degree of eEV was assessed at UGIE. The relationship of the presence and degree of EVs with PC/SD ratio was evaluated. RESULTS: Fifty consecutive cirrhotic patients (mean age+/-SD) was 52.1 (+/-16.2); 41 male and 9 female) were enrolled; nineteen 19 (38%) patients were placed in group A (No or mild EV) while 31 (62%) had endoscopic evidence of moderate to severe EV (group B). PC/SD ratio cut off value of 921 had 93% negative predictive value. PC/SD ratio found to be significantly (P&lt;0.05) different between group of A and B. CONCLUSIONS: The PC/SD ratio is independently associated with the presence of EV and can predict its severity in patients with cirrhosis. Use of this cost effective parameter may help identify patients with mild or no EV who may not need UGIE to reduce costs and discomfort for these patients and the burden on health system.",M1
20182350,"Association between fibrinogen plasma levels and <e>platelet</e> counts in an outpatient population and in patients with coronary heart disease.Although numerous studies concern fibrinogen (FBG) associations, the relationship between platelet (PLT) count and FBG plasma levels has yet to be completely investigated. The present study concerns the association between FBG plasma levels and PLT count in 5891 patients (2831 men and 3060 women) attending our outpatients' laboratory. Of these, a subgroup of 4116 patients (1899 men and 2217 women) with normal values of the parameters investigated was selected. A group of 170 patients with coronary heart disease was also included. The parameters studied were FBG, PLT count, leukocyte count and age. Our results showed that, in the outpatient population, FBG was significantly correlated with the PLT count (P &lt; 0.000001) and, as previously reported, with the leukocyte count and age. In the patients with coronary heart disease, there was a significant correlation between FBG and PLT count (P &lt; 0.000001), to be considered very significant considering the limited number of patients, whereas no correlation with age or leukocyte count was found. The role of interleukin-6, both in FBG and PLT production, is well known and may explain the correlation between these two parameters. The association of FBG and PLT count has yet to be fully investigated in epidemiological studies, even though they play an important role as two of the major contributors to the pathogenesis and evolution of cardiovascular diseases.",M1

The present study compared the effect of two such coatings on the inflammatory reactions after open heart surgery. METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing elective heart surgery were randomly assigned to receive one of two types of coated circuits: Bioline (n=15) or phosphorylcholine (Phisio, n=15). The <e>platelet</e> and leukocyte counts, neutrophil activation (myeloperoxidase), complement activation (C3a and TCC), concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase, 27 cytokines (including interleukins, chemokines and growth factors), thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and the endothelial cell marker syndecan-1 were analyzed at five predetermined time points until 24 hrs post operatively. RESULTS: Most measurements were comparable in both groups. However, myeloperoxidase was significantly higher in the Bioline group (p &lt; 0.001). Postoperative lactate dehydrogenase concentrations were significantly higher in the Phisio group (p&lt;0.01) and the maximal concentration of thrombin-antithrombin complexes 2 hours postoperatively tended to be higher in the Phisio group (p=0.08), consistent with a longer aortic cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass time.

20172135,"Risk factor analysis in patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing cardiovascular operations.BACKGROUND: Variable outcomes of cardiac operations have been reported in cirrhotic patients, but no definitive predictive prognostic factors have been established. This retrospective study assessed operative results to identify risk factors associated with morbidity after cardiovascular operations in cirrhotic patients. METHODS: The study comprised 42 cirrhotic patients who underwent cardiovascular operations from January 1991 to January 2009. Thirty patients were Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A, and 12 were class B. Hospital morbidity occurred in 13 patients (31.0%; M group), including 4 who died in-hospital. Patients without severe complications (N group) were compared with the M group patients. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was evaluated in 25 patients. RESULTS: Significant differences in hospital morbidity between the M vs N groups were identified for <e>platelet</e> count (8.7 +/- 3.8 vs 12.1 +/- 4.2 x 10(4)/microL), MELD score (17.8 +/- 5.3 vs 9.8 +/- 4.9), operation time (370 +/- 88 vs 313 +/- 94 minutes), and cardiopulmonary bypass time (174 +/- 46 vs 149 +/- 53 minutes) in univariate analyses (p &lt; 0.005). Platelet count, operation time, and age were significantly associated with hospital morbidity in multivariate analyses (p &lt; 0.005). Platelet count of 9.6 x 10(4)/microL and MELD score of 13 were cutoff values for hospital morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Careful consideration of operative indications and methods are necessary in cirrhotic patients with low platelet counts or high MELD scores. A high incidence of hospital morbidity is predicted in patients with platelet counts of less than 9.6 x 10(4)/microL or MELD scores exceeding 13.",M1
20164779,"Noninvasive diagnosis and prognosis of liver cirrhosis: a comparison of biological scores, elastometry, and metabolic liver function tests.BACKGROUND: Recently, noninvasive methods for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis have been extensively developed. We assessed the accuracy of liver stiffness measurement, aspartate aminotransferase-to-<e>platelet</e> ratio index (APRI) score, 13C-aminopyrine breath test, and indocyanine green plasma clearance for the diagnosis of cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease and for the prediction of severe complications in cirrhotic patients. METHODS: A total of 296 consecutive patients with chronic liver diseases of various causes were studied. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the diagnosis of cirrhosis were (95% confidence interval) 0.93 (0.90-0.96) for liver stiffness measurement, 0.82 (0.77-0.87) for 13C-aminopyrine breath test, and 0.81 (0.76-0.86) for APRI score. Using cutoff values of 14.1 kPa for liver stiffness, 4.15% dose/h for 13C-aminopyrine breath test, and 1 for APRI score, the positive predictive value was approximately 90% for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. Using cutoff values of 65.2 kPa for liver stiffness, 1.17% dose/h for 13C-aminopyrine breath test, 2.82 for APRI score, and 51.1% for indocyanine green plasma clearance, the positive predictive value was approximately 80% for the occurrence of severe complications among cirrhotic patients. CONCLUSION: Liver stiffness measurement, 13C-aminopyrine breath test, indocyanine green plasma clearance, and APRI score are reliable noninvasive methods for the diagnosis of cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver diseases of various causes, and are also prognostic indicators for the occurrence of severe complications in cirrhotic patients.",M1
20164660,"Anagrelide for the treatment of thrombocythaemia in daily clinical practice: a post-marketing observational survey on efficacy and safety performed in Germany.BACKGROUND: Myeloproliferative diseases - in particular essential thrombocythaemia (ET) - may be associated with increases in <e>platelet</e> count which put patients at risk of life-threatening complications such as thromboses and severe bleedings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicentre post-marketing observational survey was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of anagrelide under daily practice conditions in at-risk patients with ET who received anagrelide for the first time. RESULTS: 198 patients (median age of 64 years, range 19-88 years) were included, 61.1% of the patients were women. The mean observation time was 6.2 +/- 1.7 months. Treatment with anagrelide lowered the platelet counts by a median of 316 x 10(9)/l from a median of 797 x 10(9)/l at the beginning of the observation to 470 x 10(9)/l at the last observation (log rank test, p &lt; 0.001). Disease-related complications were reduced during treatment compared to 6 months prior to treatment (transient ischaemic attacks from 1.5 to 0.5%; thromboses from 7.6 to 0%). The number of bleedings remained the same at 1.5%. Adverse events were documented in 46 patients (23.2%). All observed adverse events were similar to those previously reported in clinical studies.

20164484,"Dose of prophylactic <e>platelet</e> transfusions and prevention of hemorrhage.BACKGROUND: We conducted a trial of prophylactic platelet transfusions to evaluate the effect of platelet dose on bleeding in patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia. METHODS: We randomly assigned hospitalized patients undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or chemotherapy for hematologic cancers or solid tumors to receive prophylactic platelet transfusions at a low dose, a medium dose, or a high dose (1.1x10(11), 2.2x10(11), or 4.4x10(11) platelets per square meter of body-surface area, respectively), when morning platelet counts were 10,000 per cubic millimeter or lower. Clinical signs of bleeding were assessed daily. The primary end point was bleeding of grade 2 or higher (as defined on the basis of World Health Organization criteria). RESULTS: In the 1272 patients who received at least one platelet transfusion, the primary end point was observed in 71%, 69%, and 70% of the patients in the low-dose group, the medium-dose group, and the high-dose group, respectively (differences were not significant). The incidences of higher grades of bleeding, and other adverse events, were similar among the three groups. The median number of platelets transfused was significantly lower in the low-dose group (9.25x10(11)) than in the medium-dose group (11.25x10(11)) or the high-dose group (19.63x10(11)) (P=0.002 for low vs. medium, P&lt;0.001 for high vs. low and high vs. medium), but the median number of platelet transfusions given was significantly higher in the low-dose group (five, vs. three in the medium-dose and three in the high-dose group; P&lt;0.001 for low vs. medium and low vs. high). Bleeding occurred on 25% of the study days on which morning platelet counts were 5000 per cubic millimeter or lower, as compared with 17% of study days on which platelet counts were 6000 to 80,000 per cubic millimeter (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low doses of platelets administered as a prophylactic transfusion led to a decreased number of platelets transfused per patient but an increased number of transfusions given. At doses between 1.1x10(11) and 4.4x10(11) platelets per square meter, the number of platelets in the prophylactic transfusion had no effect on the incidence of bleeding.

20162249,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), typically occurring in the second week of heparin therapy, is an antibody-mediated adverse drug reaction associated with increased thrombotic risk. The most important antigens are located on <e>platelet</e> factor 4 (PF4)/heparin complexes. HIT is always caused by platelet-activating antibodies, but not all PF4/heparin-reactive antibodies cause HIT. Thus, tests have a high negative, but only a moderate, positive predictive value. Clinical suspicion of HIT requires cessation of heparin and substitution with an alternative anticoagulant. As these drugs have an increased bleeding risk, they should be used in therapeutic doses only if HIT is considered very likely. Avoiding/postponing coumarin is crucial in minimizing microthrombotic complications. Recent studies of HIT immunobiology suggest that HIT mimics immunity against repetitive antigens, as are relevant in microbial defense. Thus, understanding HIT may help unravel why host defenses can trigger autoimmunity.",M1
20160638,"Predicting high grade lesions of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome related to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases: correlation with post-hepatectomy outcome.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy induces sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) lesions in the nontumorous liver parenchyma, which may increase the risk of liver resection for colorectal liver metastases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of aspartate aminotransferase to <e>platelet</e> ratio index (APRI) and FIB-4 scoring systems to predict chemotherapy-associated liver injury and to correlate the severity of sinusoidal injury with postoperative outcome. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2007, 78 patients were operated for colorectal liver metastases after preoperative oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Grading of steatosis and SOS in the nontumorous liver parenchyma was obtained in these patients. Univariate analysis of 18 preoperative factors to predict SOS occurrence was performed as well as multivariate analysis. Relevance of preoperative platelet count level, transaminase levels, and fibrosis scoring systems were evaluated to predict high grade lesions of SOS using a receiving operative curve analysis. Ninety-day mortality and morbidity were studied according to SOS severity in 51 patients who underwent major liver resection. RESULTS: Overall, pathologic examination showed high-grade lesions of SOS (SOS 2/3) in 46 (59%) patients. Univariate analysis showed that a low preoperative platelet count, elevated preoperative aspartate aminotransferase, short interval between chemotherapy and surgery were significant factors associated with high-grade lesions of SOS. Multivariate analysis showed that only the APRI score was an independent predictive factor for severe SOS. Receiving operative curve analysis revealed that the cut-off value predicting high-grade lesions of SOS with the best accuracy was an APRI score of 0.36 (area under the curve, 0.85; sensitivity, 87%; specificity, 69%). After major liver resection (n = 51), SOS 2/3 (n = 38) was associated with postoperative hepatic dysfunction (26/38 in SOS 2/3 vs. 3/13 in SOS 0/1; P = 0.004) and ascites (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: A low preoperative platelet count and high APRI score seem to be the most reliable indicators to predict SOS severity.",M1

Because TTP-HUS is 90% fatal without plasma exchange, prompt diagnosis is essential. To test the hypothesis that routine laboratory assays can discriminate between the 2 entities, we retrospectively identified adult patients with TTP-HUS and matched each with 2 patients with DIC. Although the platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time were different (P &lt; .05) between the 2 patient groups, after regression analysis, only PT and profound thrombocytopenia remained associated with TTP-HUS (P = .001 and P = .003, respectively). A platelet count of less than 20 x 10(3)/microL (20 x 10(9)/L) and a PT within 5 seconds of the upper limit of the reference interval had a specificity of 92% for TTP-HUS. Our data confirm that readily available laboratory assays in the proper clinical scenario can increase the likelihood of TTP-HUS over DIC.",M1

Although recent studies have shown that JAK2 kinase inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in a JAK2V617F murine bone marrow transplantation model, the effects of JAK2 inhibitors on MPLW515L-mediated myeloproliferation have not been investigated. In this report, we describe the in vitro and in vivo effects of INCB16562, a small-molecule JAK2 inhibitor. INCB16562 inhibited proliferation and signaling in cell lines transformed by JAK2 and MPL mutations. Compared with vehicle treatment, INCB16562 treatment improved survival, normalized white blood cell counts and <e>platelet</e> counts, and markedly reduced extramedullary hematopoeisis and bone marrow fibrosis. We observed inhibition of STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in vivo consistent with potent inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling. These data suggest JAK2 inhibitor therapy may be of value in the treatment of JAK2V617F-negative MPNs. However, we did not observe a decrease in the size of the malignant clone in the bone marrow of treated mice at the end of therapy, which suggests that JAK2 inhibitor therapy, by itself, was not curative in this MPN model.",M1
20142345,"The relationship among thromboelastography, hemostatic variables, and bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery in children.BACKGROUND: Mediastinal bleeding is common after pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. Thromboelastography (TEG) may predict bleeding and provide insight into likely mechanisms. We aimed to (a) compare perioperative temporal profiles of TEG and laboratory hemostatic variables between patients with significant hemorrhage (BLEED) and those without (CONTROL), (b) investigate the relationship between TEG variables and routine hemostatic variables, and (c) develop a model for prediction of bleeding. METHODS: TEG and laboratory hemostatic variables were measured prospectively at 8 predefined times for 50 children weighing &lt;20 kg undergoing CPB. RESULTS: Patients who bled demonstrated different TEG profiles than those who did not. This was most apparent after protamine administration and was partly attributable to inadequate heparin reversal, but was also associated with a significantly lower nadir in mean (sd) fibrinogen for the BLEED group compared with CONTROL group: 0.44 (0.18) and 0.71 (0.40) g/L, respectively (P = 0.01). Significant nonlinear relationships were found between the majority of TEG and laboratory hemostatic variables. The strongest relationship was between the maximal amplitude and the <e>platelet</e>-fibrinogen product (logarithmic r(2) = 0.71). Clot strength decreased rapidly when (a) fibrinogen concentration was &lt;1 g/L, (b) platelets were &lt;120 x 10(9)/L, and (c) platelet-fibrinogen product was &lt;100. A 2-variable model including the activated partial thromboplastin time at induction of anesthesia and TEG mean amplitude postprotamine discriminated well for subsequent bleeding (C statistic 0.859). CONCLUSIONS: Hypofibrinogenemia and inadequate heparin reversal are 2 important factors contributing to clot strength and perioperative hemorrhage after pediatric CPB. TEG may be a useful tool for predicting and guiding early treatment of mediastinal bleeding in this group.",M1

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a dangerous potential complication of this therapy, but it has rarely been reported in Ph-MPD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical records of 29 patients with Ph-MPD who have been treated with UFH or LMWH for unusual splanchnic or cerebral vein thrombosis (3 cerebral sinus, 6 portal and 20 hepatic vein). The goal of the study was to determine the occurrence of new thrombotic events during heparin therapy secondary to HIT (HITT). RESULTS: During heparin therapy, 5 out of the 29 patients (17%) developed a new thrombotic episode (pulmonary embolism) with a high clinical probability of HIT based on the 4 T's score even though not all the patients developed 'true' thrombocytopenia. A diagnosis of HIT was established in 2 patients (6.8%) through the presence of heparin-related antibodies.

This randomized trial investigated rituximab efficacy in previously untreated adult ITP patients with a <e>platelet</e> count of 20 x 10(9)/L or less. One hundred three patients were randomly assigned to receive 40 mg/d dexamethasone for 4 days with or without 375 mg/m(2) rituximab weekly for 4 weeks. Patients who were refractory to dexamethasone alone received salvage therapy with dexamethasone plus rituximab. Sustained response (ie, platelet count &gt; or = 50 x 10(9)/L at month 6 after treatment initiation), evaluable in 101 patients, was greater in patients treated with dexamethasone plus rituximab (n = 49) than in those treated with dexamethasone alone (n = 52; 63% vs 36%, P = .004, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.079-0.455). Patients in the experimental arm showed increased incidences of grade 3 to 4 adverse events (10% vs 2%, P = .082, 95% CI, -0.010 to 0.175), but incidences of serious adverse events were similar in both arms (6% vs 2%, P = .284, 95% CI, -0.035 to 0.119). Dexamethasone plus rituximab was an effective salvage therapy in 56% of patients refractory to dexamethasone. The combination of dexamethasone and rituximab improved platelet counts compared with dexamethasone alone. Thus, combination therapy may represent an effective treatment option before splenectomy.

20129489,"Development of an improved assay system for activated <e>platelet</e> counts and evaluation by aspirin monitoring.Platelets represent a linkage among inflammation, thrombosis, and atherogenesis, and enhanced platelet activation is regarded as a risk for thrombotic disorders. The level of P-selectin expressed (CD62P) on the platelet surface is a useful marker of activated platelets (aPLT). Although CD62P has been measured briefly by flow cytometry using an anti-CD62P antibody, the assay remains imprecise and we tried to establish stable conditions for its measurement. The levels of aPLT are increased significantly by many factors, such as meals, sampling and keeping conditions, centrifugation, and the timing of fixation. For optimal results, sampling should be performed quickly in a K(2)-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) containing a sample tube, and whole blood should be fixed with 666 mmol/L formaldehyde plus 167 mmol/L glyoxal for 5 min. After washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the fixed platelets were reacted with anti-CD62P antibody for 20 min and measured by flow-cytometric detection for aPLT. The coefficient of variation of our aPLT assay was 10.4%. We also examined basic experiments to test the clinical application of our aPLT assay by monitoring aspirin therapy. The levels of aPLT after the administration of aspirin for 3 days were significantly lower than those in the group that did not receive aspirin. These results suggest that the aPLT assay is an effective analytical procedure for measuring platelet reactivity.",M1

Platelets play an important role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke but the effect of platelet count (PC) and dysfunction in the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic stroke is poorly understood. We have investigated the possibility of MPV and PC being an independent risk factor of ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke and their effect on prognosis. METHODS: We prospectively studied 692 patients with either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and compared them with 208 control subjects with similar risk factors, but without evidence of vascular events. The association of MPV and PC with cause, localization, and size of the infarct or hemorrhage was examined. Prognosis was determined by Glasgow Outcome Scale. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the influence of MPV and PC on stroke subtype and prognosis was determined. RESULTS: MPV and PC were observed as independent risk factors for ischemic stroke (P = .007, odds ratio [OR] = 0.866; P = .000, OR = 0.996; 95% confidence interval [CI], respectively). There was a negative and significant correlation between PC and hemorrhagic stroke (P = .001), but no association was found with MPV (P &gt; .05). MPV and PC were not statistically significant related to etiological subgroups, localization, and size of the infarct or hemorrhage (P &gt; .05). Ischemic group MPV (P = .013, OR = 1.02, 95% CI) and hemorrhagic group PC were in correlation with worse outcome (P = .001, OR = 1.004, 95% CI). CONCLUSION: MPV, may be an early and important predictor for the prognosis of ischemic stroke, whereas for hemorrhagic stroke PC has a role for outcome.",M1
20123206,"Large-bore tunneled central venous catheter insertion in patients with coagulopathy.PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety of tunneled central venous catheter (TCVC) insertion in patients with an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of greater than or equal to 1.5 or a <e>platelet</e> count lower than 50,000/dL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our division's criteria for acceptable coagulation parameters in patients undergoing TCVC insertion is INR no greater than 2 and platelet count of at least 25,000/dL. Three-thousand one-hundred and eighty-eight TCVCs (8-14.5 F) placed between July 2001 and July 2008 were identified. After excluding incomplete records, 2,514 patients undergoing 3,170 TCVC placements were identified. The most current platelet count and INR at the time of TCVC insertion were identified. Bleeding complications were compared between patients with platelet counts lower than 50,000/dL and/or INR of at least 1.5 and published standards for complication rates for TCVC insertion. RESULTS: Of the total of 3,170 TCVCs placed, 428 were in patients whose most current platelet count was lower than 50,000/dL and 361 were in patients with an INR of 1.5 or greater. After exclusion of intercurrent blood product transfusion, 626 TCVCs placed in 567 patients with a platelet count lower than 50,000/dL and/or an INR of at least 1.5 were identified. There were 27 complications in the entire study population (0.85%); three were in patients with platelet counts lower than 50,000/dL and/or INR of at least 1.5. There were three bleeding complications in the study population (0.095%), none in patients with platelet count lower than 50,000/dL and/or INR of at least 1.5. CONCLUSIONS: Placement of TCVCs in patients with a platelet count between 25,000/dL and 50,000/dL and/or an INR between 1.5 and 2 is safe even without coagulation product transfusions.",M1

20110000,"Management of refractory essential thrombocythemia with anagrelide in a patient undergoing hemodialysis.BACKGROUND: Management of essential thrombocythemia (ET) in high-risk patients is difficult because high <e>platelet</e> numbers can lead to vascular occlusive events and bleeding. Therapeutic interventions in ET are limited to hydroxyurea and anagrelide; however, in Europe, anagrelide is contraindicated in patients with chronic renal disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this case report was to describe the use of anagrelide in a patient with ET and renal impairment. CASE SUMMARY: A 73-year-old white female patient with severe renal impairment who was diagnosed with ET was receiving treatment with hydroxyurea 1 g/d since 2001. At this time she was also receiving aspirin 80 mg/d; calcium carbonate 1 g/d; pravastatin 40 mg/d; folic acid 5 mg/d; furosemide 40 mg/d; cetirizine 10 mg/d; erythropoietin 10,000 U once monthly; a vitamin B complex, 1 tablet a day; and iron tablets 105 mg/d. In February 2007, because her white blood cell count fell to 2.1 x 10(9)/L, myelodepression was suspected and hydroxyurea was stopped. This led to enhanced platelet levels and the introduction of anagrelide at an initial dose of 0.5 mg/d that was steadily increased to 2.5 mg/d. All other treatments were continued with some dosage adjustments. Sodium bicarbonate 1 g/d and vitamin D were added to her regimen. After 18 months of anagrelide treatment, a sudden but moderate fall of platelets to 142 x 10(3)/microL with severe anemia (hemoglobin, 6.5 g/dL) was observed. The patient had anemia since 2004, but the condition worsened due to bleeding related to an ulcer at the cecal valve. The patient refused blood and platelet transfusions and surgical intervention for religious reasons. Because of hemodynamic instability, she was admitted to the intensive care unit in December 2008 and died 24 hours after admission. Conclusion: We report a case of ET and chronic renal failure treated with anagrelide and low-dose aspirin in a patient who did not receive transfusion and surgical intervention due to religious reasons, and had a fatal outcome.",M1
20109983,"Thrombocytopenia and outcome in critically ill patients with bloodstream infection.OBJECTIVE: Thrombocytopenia is common in intensive care units (ICUs), and is associated with a poor prognosis. An acute decrease in total <e>platelet</e> count is frequently observed in severe sepsis, followed by a relative increase indicating organ-failure recovery. However, few data are available describing this effect and its relationship with outcomes in specific subgroups of ICU patients. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted to investigate the incidence and prognosis of thrombocytopenia in a cohort of critically ill patients (n=155) with a microbiologically documented nosocomial bloodstream infection. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently in nonsurvivors. The ICU mortality rates increased according to severity of thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was independently associated with worse outcomes in ICU patients with nosocomial bloodstream infection. CONCLUSION: Determining trends in platelet counts is of additional prognostic value, compared with single measurements.",M1
20105594,"Predicting response to splenectomy in children with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.PURPOSE: Predicting the response to splenectomy in children with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) continues to be a clinical challenge. The purpose of this study is to identify preoperative predictors of outcome for splenectomy in children with ITP. METHODS: The charts of 19 children who underwent splenectomy for ITP were retrospectively reviewed. <e>Platelet</e> responses to treatment are categorized as complete response (CR, &gt; or =150,000/microL), partial response (PR, &gt; or =50,000 but &lt;150,000/microL), or nonresponse (NR, &lt;50,000/microL). RESULTS: After splenectomy, 13 patients (68%) had CR, 3 (16%) had PR, and 3 (16%) had NR. No correlation existed between CR to splenectomy and any of the following: age, platelet count at diagnosis, last platelet count before splenectomy, platelet count on postoperative day 1, or responses to preoperative intravenous immunoglobulin, WinRho, or Rituximab. However, all 7 patients who had NR to a full course of steroids subsequently had CR to splenectomy. Nonresponse to steroid therapy was directly correlated with CR to splenectomy (P = .01, Fisher's Exact test). Furthermore, postsplenectomy platelet counts were inversely related to peak platelet response to steroids (correlation coefficient = -0.68, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative responsiveness to steroid therapy, as measured by peak platelet count, predicts NR to splenectomy for ITP in children, whereas NR to steroid therapy is highly correlated with CR to splenectomy. These findings challenge the widely held notion that steroid responsiveness portends a favorable outcome after splenectomy.",M1
20104461,"Acute myocardial infarction in a patient with post-splenectomy thrombocytosis: a case report and review of literature.Unlike essential thrombocytosis, which is associated with thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications, reactive thrombocytosis (RT) is usually considered a benign process without thrombotic complications. We describe a case of acute myocardial infarction in a young heavy smoker with RT following splenectomy. Coronary angiography showed a linear filling defect at mid-part of left anterior descending artery. We performed balloon angioplasty and stenting for this lesion. Aspirin and clopidogrel were administered. His in-hospital course was uneventful and <e>platelet</e> count returned to the normal range at four month follow-up. We concluded that RT may not be an entirely benign process, especially in patients with a history of smoking. Regular monitoring of platelet count, and possibly antithrombotic agents like aspirin prescription for high risk patients with moderate thrombocytosis, may be useful.",M1
20103996,"Thrombocytopenia, an important interfering factor of antiviral therapy and hepatocellular carcinoma treatment for chronic liver diseases.In patients with chronic liver diseases, thrombocytopenia is a common manifestation which interferes with antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV), and with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. While thrombopoietin-receptor agonist is expected to improve thrombocytopenia for patients with chronic liver diseases in 2-3 weeks, there is still a lack of fundamental data about short-term variations in the natural course of <e>platelet</e> count in cirrhotic patients, and the impact of thrombocytopenia on antiviral therapy for HCV-infected patients and patients being treated for HCC. The aims of this study are to investigate sequential changes in platelet count and the impact of thrombocytopenia on antiviral therapy and HCC treatment in patients with chronic liver diseases. A total of 726 chronic liver disease patients were enrolled in this study. Changes of platelet count were examined during a 4-week follow-up. Risk of discontinuation or reduction of peginterferon dosage was evaluated in HCV patients with moderate thrombocytopenia (5-10x10(4)/microL). Risk of platelet transfusion or splenectomy was evaluated in HCC patients with severe thrombocytopenia (&lt;5x10(4)/microL). No significant changes of platelet count were observed in cirrhotic patients with thrombocytopenia during a 4-week follow-up. The rate of discontinuation or reduction in dosage of peginterferon was 85.2% (23/27) in patients with moderate thrombocytopenia. Risk of discontinuation or reduction of peginterferon dosage was 3.4-times higher in HCV patients with thrombocytopenia than in those without thrombocytopenia. In HCC patients with severe thrombocytopenia, the frequency of platelet transfusion or splenectomy during HCC treatment was 57.9% (22/38). Risk of platelet transfusion or splenectomy in HCC patients with thrombocytopenia was 57.9-times higher than in those without thrombocytopenia. In conclusion, we demonstrated no significant variation in the short-term natural course of platelet count in cirrhotic patients. In chronic liver disease patients with moderate and severe thrombocytopenia, about 85% of patients treated with peginterferon, and 60% of patients receiving HCC treatments suffered from thrombocytopenia-related limitations, respectively.",M1
20097357,"Predicting liver failure in parenteral nutrition-dependent short bowel syndrome of infancy.OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that early trends in common blood tests may delineate risks of liver failure (LF) in infants with parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) from short bowel syndrome and suggest criteria for transplant referral. STUDY DESIGN: Total levels of bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, <e>platelet</e> count, and absolute neutrophil count were recorded every 3 months for 61 infants with PNALD who were being considered for intestinal transplant starting at age 3 months until death without transplant (n = 12), LF with transplant (n = 35), or liver recovery without transplant (n = 14). Probabilities of LF were determined with logistic regression. RESULTS: Independent predictors of LF were, in descending order, total bilirubin level (odds ratio [OR] = 1.195), platelet count (OR = 0.992), and albumin level (OR = 0.248). Predicted probabilities of eventual LF varied from 36% to 38% at ages 3 to 6 months when the total bilirubin level was 6.0 mg/dL, platelet count was 220 x 10(3)/microL, and albumin level was 3.5 g/dL to 83% to 84% when the total bilirubin level was 11.7 mg/dL, platelet count was 168 x 10(3)/microL, and albumin level was 3.0 g/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Transplant referral for a total bilirubin level of 6 mg/dL between 3 to 6 months of age is appropriate, because the probability of LF is at least 36%.",M1
20087173,"Effect of caffeic acid phenethyl ester on the hemostatic alterations associated with toxic-induced acute liver failure.Coagulation abnormalities are common findings in acute liver failure (ALF) that underlie its fatal outcome. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) on the oxidative stress and the disturbed hemostasis in lipopolysaccharide/galactosamine-induced ALF in rats. Fifty male Wistar rats were divided into control, ALF and a CAPE-treated ALF groups. Liver transaminases (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase), total bilirubin, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen level, anti-thrombin III levels, <e>platelet</e> count and antioxidative enzymes; catalase and superoxide dismutase activities in serum and reduced glutathione levels in serum and liver tissue were investigated. The ALF group showed increased serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase and total bilirubin. Coagulation tests showed prolonged prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, decreased platelet count, fibrinogen and anti-thrombin III levels, and decreased activities of the antioxidative enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase and decreased tissue and serum glutathione levels. Pretreatment with CAPE for 14 days before and a single dose after the exposure to the lipopolysaccharide/D-galactosamine reversed the abnormal liver functions and blood coagulation tests and increased the antioxidative enzymes activities and glutathione levels. CAPE is a promising compound that can support the liver, counteract oxidative stress and disturbed hemostasis in endotoxic-induced ALF.",M1
20077379,"[Rituximab as effective therapy in very severe thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)]HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 26-year-old woman was admitted from another hospital because of an increased serum creatinine (170 micromol/l). She was found to have a thrombocytopenia (14Gpt/l, WHO grade IV) with anaemia and a raised lactate dehydrogenase (25.45 micromol/l). The patient was in a reduced general state when admitted to this hospital. Her mucosal membranes were pale and she had moderate scleral icterus. During the first few hours she became clearly less alert but without motor or sensory deficits. Investigations and diagnosis: Laboratory tests showed an increased total bilirubin (73 micromol, decreased haptoglobin (&lt; 0.08 g/l), free hemoglobin was raised (20.7 micromol/l) and the blood smear showed 5.5% fragmentocytes. Direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Thrombotic thrombocytic purpura (TTP) was diagnosed. Daily plasmapheresis with fresh plasma replacement and administration of corticosteroids was initiated. ADAMTS13 activity (reported later) was &lt; 2 % and antibodies against this protease were demonstrated. After initial improvement a motor and sensory aphasia occurred. Because of progressive thrombocytopenia, immunosuppression with a total of four doses of 375 mg/m(2)/bsa rituximab was undertaken (640 mg each), every seven days. Over the next two to three weeks the <e>platelet</e> count very slowly rose. The plasmapheresis was ended after a total of 65 sessions. Nine months after the last plasmapheresis the platelet count and renal functions were normal. CONCLUSION: Severe autoantibody TTP can be successfully treated by administering rituximanb, an anti-CD20 antibody, in addition to the standard treatment with plasmapheresis.",M1

Patients were given HDMP if there were findings compatible with virus-associated haemophagocytic syndrome and the effects of HDMP were evaluated. Following this, HDMP fever subsided and <e>platelet</e> counts increased within 24 hours. Leukocyte counts began to increase and visceral bleedings were improved. HDMP treatment was discontinued within approximately five days. After HDMP, only one patient required blood products. HDMP is effective in CCHF, especially on fever and platelet counts. Dependency on blood products was decreased. Further controlled randomized studies with large series are needed in order to analyse the timing and duration of HDMP treatment and its effect on outcome.",M1
20074983,"Spontaneous regression of disease manifestations can occur in type 1 Gaucher disease; results of a retrospective cohort study.Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, caused by deficient activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. GD is classically divided into three major phenotypes. The most prevailing form is type 1, which presents with variable hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, and/or bone disease. In adult patients with mild manifestations, progress of disease might be slow or even absent. As a consequence, treatment with intravenous enzyme replacement or substrate reduction is not always necessary. In the Netherlands, the follow-up of GD patients is centralized, which allows detailed investigation of untreated patients. A retrospective study was conducted in 18 type 1 GD patients, (2 teenagers: 15 and 16 years of age at first visit) who were not treated for at least one year. The chitotriosidase activity, <e>platelet</e> count, hemoglobin level, lumbar bone marrow fat content measured with quantitative chemical shift imaging (QCSI), liver ratio (ml/kg body weight), and spleen volume were recorded. Criteria were developed to score regression, stability or progression of disease. During a mean follow up of 4.5 years (range 1.1-12.2) seven patients (39%) showed spontaneous regression of GD. Eight patients (44%) were stable. Two patients had progressive disease, solely based upon a sustained increase in chitotriosidase activity. A pediatric patient had an increase in splenomegaly but an improvement in bone marrow fat fraction, probably due to aging. Nine patients fulfilled the local criteria to start treatment at first visit, of whom six started treatment within 1.1 to 6.8 years. The other three refused therapy, but nevertheless showed stability or even regression of the disease during a follow up of 4.6, 9.5 and 11.4 years respectively. None of the parameters was predictive of progression or regression of disease. In conclusion, GD in adults can, in some cases, regress spontaneously. No parameters for accurately predicting future disease course exist.",M1

METHODS: 151 patients with leg ulcer (81 with venous, 50 with diabetic and 20 with arterial ulcers) and 150 controls were included. In both groups search for the presence of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin and platelet count was done. In the leg ulcer group demographic data, obstetrical history, previous history of venous thrombosis as well as presence of livedo reticularis by physical examination were pointed out. Data was grouped in contingency and frequency tables and the tests of Fisher and chi-squared were used for nominal variables and Mann Whitney and Kruskall Wallis for numerical variables. The adopted significance was of 5%. RESULTS: It was found an anticardiolipin prevalence of 7.2% (n=12) in the leg ulcer group and of 1.3% (n=2) in the control group (p=0.01). Leg ulcer patients with anticardiolipin did not differ from those without it in gender (p=0.98), previous history of venous thrombosis (p=0.69), previous history of abortions (p=0.67) and platelet count (p=0.67). Only two patients had livedo reticularis which precluded any conclusion on this data. CONCLUSION: There is an increased prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies in the general population with leg ulcers. Clinical characteristics of ulcers as well as platelet count do not help in the identification of these patients.",M1
20046626,"Evaluation of laboratory methods to improve characterization of dogs with von Willebrand disease.The objective of the study was to investigate the value of additional tests [<e>platelet</e> count, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), platelet function analysis using the PFA-100, Collagen binding assay (vWF:CBA), and Factor VIII activity], for use in conjunction with the von Willebrand factor antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as part of a newly developed diagnostic profile for improved characterization of patients with von Willebrand disease (vWD). The study population included 183 clinically healthy canines ranging in vWF:Ag concentration from 1% to 125%. The Asserachrom vWF:Ag ELISA assay was used as an external control for the determination of vWD status. Degree of association between the additional tests and vWF concentration was evaluated, and associations between the additional tests were also assessed, including their ability to distinguish dogs with vWD from those without vWD. In addition, a reference interval was determined for the PFA-100 platelet function analyzer. Strong associations were found between the PFA-100, vWF:CBA, and Asserachrom vWF:Ag assay, and a significant association was found between the PFA-100 and vWF:CBA. An association was detected between Factor VIII activity and the Asserachrom vWF:Ag assay, the vWF:CBA and the PFA-100; however, a corresponding pattern was not visually apparent in the raw data, making the association clinically irrelevant. The association between the platelet count and the PTT with the other additional tests was negligible. Based on our results, the vWF:CBA and PFA-100 would be valuable assets, in conjunction with a vWF:Ag assay, in a canine vWD diagnostic profile to further characterize patients with this disease.",M1
20046080,"[Evaluation of <e>platelet</e> indices for differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis by ADVIA 120]BACKGROUND: For the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia (ET), no single clinical or laboratory finding of diagnostic value is available and a differential diagnosis of other myeloproliferative neoplasms or reactive thrombocytosis (RT) is needed. Following recent developments in automated blood cell analyzers, various platelet indices can now be measured. In this study, we analyzed whether platelet counts and 6 platelet indices can be used for the differentiation of ET from RT in patients with a platelet count of 600x10(3)/microL or more. METHODS: The subjects studied were 31 patients with ET and 224 patients with RT. The platelet counts, mean platelet volume (MPV), plateletcrit (PCT), platelet distribution width (PDW), mean platelet mass (MPM), mean platelet component concentration (MPC) and large platelets (LPLT) were measured by ADVIA 120 (Bayer Diagnostics, USA). The mean values of each item were compared between the two patient groups and the sensitivity and specificity of each item in the diagnosis of ET were determined by ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: In essential thrombocythemia, all parameters except MPC were significantly higher than in reactive thrombocytosis. For the diagnosis of ET, the sensitivity and specificity were: 74.2% and 84.4%, when the platelet count was &gt; or = 820 x 10(3)/microL; 80.6% and 80.0%, when the plateletcrit was &gt; or = 0.63%; and 64.5% and 99.1%, respectively, when LPLT was &gt; or = 23 x 10(3)/microL. CONCLUSIONS: The platelet counts and platelet indices are useful for the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis. The plateletcrit and LPLT are particularly useful for the diagnosis of ET when the platelet count is markedly increased.",M1
20042236,"The attenuation of <e>platelet</e> and monocyte activation in a rabbit model of extracorporeal circulation by a nitric oxide releasing polymer.Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to reduce thrombogenicity by decreasing platelet and monocyte activation by the surface glycoprotein, P-selectin and the integrin, CD11b, respectively. In order to prevent platelet and monocyte activation with exposure to an extracorporeal circulation (ECC), a nitric oxide releasing (NORel) polymeric coating composed of plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) blended with a lipophilic N-diazeniumdiolate was evaluated in a 4 h rabbit thrombogenicity model using flow cytometry. The NORel polymer significantly reduced ECC thrombus formation compared to polymer control after 4 h blood exposure (2.8 +/- 0.7 NORel vs 6.7 +/- 0.4 pixels/cm(2) control). Platelet count (3.4 +/- 0.3 NORel vs 2.3 +/- 0.3 x 10(8)/ml control) and function as measured by aggregometry (71 +/- 3 NORel vs 17 +/- 6% control) were preserved after 4 h exposure in NORel versus control ECC. Plasma fibrinogen levels significantly decreased in both NORel and control groups. Platelet P-selectin mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) as measured by flow cytometry was attenuated after 4 h on ECC to ex vivo collagen stimulation (27 +/- 1 NORel vs 40 +/- 2 MFI control). Monocyte CD11b expression was reduced after 4 h on ECC with NORel polymer (87 +/- 14 NORel vs 162 +/- 30 MFI control). These results suggest that the NORel polymer coatings attenuate the increase in both platelet P-selectin and monocytic CD11b integrin expression in blood exposure to ECCs. These NO-mediated platelet and monocytic changes were shown to improve thromboresistance of these NORel-polymer-coated ECCs for biomedical devices.",M1
20042130,"Single access laparoscopic splenectomy.BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic splenectomy has been performed in a standard fashion with 4 to 5 trocars since the early 1990s. Single access laparoscopy has recently gained interest, but single access laparoscopic splenectomy has not been reported to date. It has the possible benefits of less pain, faster recovery, better cosmesis, with theoretically similar costs to that of traditional trocars. METHODS: A case is presented and the surgical technique of single access laparoscopic splenectomy is detailed. RESULTS: The patient is an otherwise healthy 24-year-old male with medically refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and a <e>platelet</e> count of 15 000. A splenectomy was performed using a single incision laparoscopic technique. The patient was placed in a right lateral decubitus position, and a 2.5-cm left upper quadrant incision was made. A multi-instrument flexible single incision port was used that held 3 trocars. A standard splenectomy was performed through this port. A linear stapler was used to transect the splenic hilum. The procedure time was just over 2 hours. The patient did well, was happy with his incision, and was discharged with a platelet count of 108 000. CONCLUSIONS: Single access laparoscopic splenectomy is feasible in select patients and may provide a less painful, better cosmetic result.",M1
20037265,"[Factors associated with liver stiffness in chronic liver disease]BACKGROUND/AIMS: Transient elastography is a new noninvasive tool for measuring liver stiffness that accurately predicts significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, several studies have indicated that liver stiffness can be significantly influenced by major changes in aminotransferase in patients with chronic viral hepatitis. The aim of this study was to determine the factors influencing liver stiffness in patients with chronic liver disease. METHODS: We studied 158 patients with chronic liver disease who underwent transient elastography and liver biopsy sampling. Histologic findings on fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity in the biopsy specimens were evaluated according to the Korean Society of Pathologists Scoring System. Routine biochemical tests were performed according to standard methods. RESULTS: Liver stiffness was strongly correlated with liver fibrosis stage (Spearman coefficient=0.636, P&lt;0.001), lobular activity (Spearman coefficient=0.359, P&lt;0.001), and portoperiportal activity grade (Spearman coefficient=0.448, P&lt;0.001). Liver stiffness was significantly associated with serum levels of total bilirubin (P=0.025), direct bilirubin (P=0.049), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (P=0.014), <e>platelet</e> count (P=0.004), albumin (P&lt;0.001), and international normalized ratio (P&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that fibrosis stage (B 3.50, P=0.009) and lobular activity grade (B 3.25, P=0.047) were independently associated with liver stiffness. CONCLUSIONS: Liver stiffness as measured by transient elastography is associated with the grade of necroinflammatory activity and the stage of fibrosis, irrespective of serum ALT levels.",M1
20037264,"[Comparison of various noninvasive serum markers of liver fibrosis in chronic viral liver disease]BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the clinical performances of noninvasive serum markers for the prediction of liver fibrosis in chronic viral liver diseases. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 225 patients with chronic viral liver diseases (180 with hepatitis B virus, 43 with hepatitis C virus, and 2 with hepatitis B+C virus) who underwent a liver biopsy procedure at the Hanyang University Guri Hospital between March 2002 and February 2007. Serum was also obtained at the time of liver biopsy. Liver fibrosis was staged according to the scoring system proposed by the Korean Study Group for the Pathology of Digestive Diseases. Various noninvasive serum markers were evaluated, including the aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio (AAR), age-<e>platelet</e> (AP) index, AST/platelet ratio index (APRI), cirrhosis discriminant score (CDS), platelet count, hyaluronic acid (HA), and type IV collagen. RESULTS: There were 17, 40, 61, 74, and 33 patients at stages F0, F1, F2, F3, and F4, respectively. The overall diagnostic accuracies of each marker, as determined by the area under receiver operating characteristics curves, were APRI=0.822, CDS=0.776, platelet count=0.773, AP index=0.756, HA=0.749, type IV collagen=0.718, and AAR=0.642 for predicting significant fibrosis (&gt; or =F2); and CDS=0.835, platelet count=0.795, AP index=0.794, HA=0.766, AAR=0.711, type IV collagen=0.697, and APRI=0.691 for predicting extensive fibrosis (&gt; or =F3). CONCLUSIONS: All noninvasive serum markers evaluated in this study were useful for predicting significant or extensive liver fibrosis in chronic viral liver diseases. In particular, APRI was most useful for the prediction of significant fibrosis, and CDS was most useful for the prediction of extensive fibrosis.",M1

This study aimed to elucidate the association between virologic status and platelet count in individuals with HCV infection. METHODS: A large-scale survey, enrolling 11,239 residents, was conducted in the Kaohsiung area of Taiwan. Serum HCV RNA and non-invasive markers of fibrosis (FibroTest) were tested for antibody to HCV (anti-HCV)-positive subjects. The platelet counts of age- and sex-matched, biopsy-proven, hospital-based patients and community-based patients with minimal fibrosis were compared. RESULTS: Anti-HCV was positive in 703 (6.2%) subjects and was significantly associated with older age, female sex, abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value and low platelet count (&lt;150,000/microl). The independent factors significantly associated with low platelet count were abnormal ALT value (odds ratio [OR]: 3.70, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.18-6.28) and positive HCV RNA (OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.01-3.97). After adjustment for the fibrosis, HCV RNA remained significantly associated with platelet counts. CONCLUSIONS: Our results evaluating the association between platelet count and HCV viremia and taking the influences of fibrosis into consideration implicate that platelets may be affected directly by HCV.",M1
20029174,"Management of chronic childhood immune thrombocytopenic purpura: AIEOP consensus guidelines.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The management of chronic childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is distinct from acute ITP. Similar to the publication on acute ITP guidelines, the AIEOP (Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica) considered it appropriate to develop consensus guidelines for chronic childhood ITP to provide useful and shared information for physicians, healthcare professionals, parents and patients. DESIGN/METHODS: A preliminary, evidence-based document issued by a select group of AIEOP pediatric hematologists was discussed, modified and approved during a Consensus Conference according to procedures previously validated by the AIEOP Board. Results: The guidelines give prominence to the periodical reevaluation of all the etiological hypotheses of thrombocytopenia in relation to its clinical condition. The majority of chronic ITP children do not require treatment, especially if bleeding is absent or minimal. The treatment decision depends on several factors other than the <e>platelet</e> count, and treatment options are suggested in relation to the therapeutic scenarios. Recommendations are given regarding support for surgery, particular hemorrhagic conditions, daily activities/sports, as well as for vaccines and drugs. Experimental treatments are also discussed.",M1
20026488,"Clinical performance and biocompatibility of hyaluronan-based heparin-bonded extracorporeal circuits in different risk cohorts.This prospective randomized study compares novel hyaluronan-based heparin-bonded circuits vs. uncoated controls across EuroSCORE patient risk strata including biomaterial evaluation. Over a two-year period, 90 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were prospectively randomized to one of the two perfusion protocols: Group 1 was treated with hyaluronan-based heparin-bonded preconnected circuits (Vision HFO-GBS, Gish, CA, USA) and Group 2 with identical uncoated controls. Each group was composed of three subgroups (n=15) with respect to preoperative evaluation of low (EuroSCORE 0-2), medium (3-5) and high (6+) risk patients. Blood samples were collected after induction (T1) and heparinization (T2), 15 min after cardiopulmonary bypass start (T3), before cessation of CPB (T4), 15 min after reversal (T5), and the first postoperative day (T6). In high-risk patients, <e>platelet</e> counts demonstrated significant preservation at T4, T5 and leukocyte counts were lower at T5 in hyaluronan group (P&lt;or=0.05 vs. control). C3a (ng x ml(-1)) levels were significantly lower at T3 (0.2+/-0.04 vs. 0.31+/-0.05), T4 (0.25+/-0.04 vs. 0.51+/-0.05), T5 (0.38+/-0.04 vs. 0.56+/-0.05) and interleukin-6 (pg x ml(-1)) at T4 (91+/-18 vs. 124+/-20), T5 (110+/-20 vs. 220+/-25) in coated group vs. control (P&lt;or=0.05). Protein desorption (microalbumin) on fibers (mg x mm(-3)) was less in hyaluronan vs. control groups (P&lt;or=0.05). Hyaluronan coating reduced platelet adhesion and cell adsorption, and modulated inflammatory response in high-risk patients.",M1
20012612,"Effect of liver transplantation on spleen size, collateral veins, and <e>platelet</e> counts.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of liver transplantation on the spleen size, spontaneous splenorenal shunt (SRS) function, and platelet counts in patients with hypersplenism. METHODS: Between December 2001 and February 2007, 462 adult patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantations (OLTX) at our institution. Of these patients, CT or MRI information was reviewed retrospectively in 55 patients. Volume measurements of the spleen and liver, spleen/liver volume ratio (S/L ratio), presence and size of SRS, and platelet counts were evaluated before and after OLTX. RESULTS: Mean spleen volume decreased from 827 +/- 463 ml to 662 +/- 376 ml after OLTX (p &lt; 0.01). Five (11%) patients returned to normal-range spleen size after OLTX. SRS was observed in 19 patients before OLTX (35%). The diameter of SRS also significantly decreased from 1.0 +/- 0.5 cm before OLTX to 0.7 +/- 0.5 cm after OLTX (p &lt; 0.05). SRS disappeared in 16% of patients (3/19). S/L ratio significantly decreased from 0.65 +/- 0.33 to 0.38 +/- 0.17 (p &lt; 0.01) after OLTX. Platelet counts significantly increased after OLTX (p &lt; 0.01). Improvement of the platelet count in the group with postoperative S/L ratio &gt;0.35 was not as good as that in the group with S/L ratio &lt;0.35 (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Spleen size and SRS size became significantly smaller after OLTX. However, patients with postoperative S/L ratio &gt;0.35 tend to have lower platelet counts after OLTX.",M1
20009131,"<e>Platelet</e> count/spleen diameter ratio for non-invasive prediction of high risk esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prophylaxis therapy is indicated in cirrhotic patients with large esophageal varices or small varices with red wale signs (high risk esophageal varices; HREV). Endoscopic surveillance to detect HREV is currently recommended. The objective of this study is to identify non-invasive predictors of HREV in cirrhotic patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Adult cirrhotic patients without previous variceal bleeding were prospectively included. All patients underwent a complete biochemical workup, upper digestive endoscopy, and ultrasonographic measurement of spleen bipolar diameter. Platelet count/spleen diameter ratio (PC/SD) was calculated for all patients. The association of these variables with the presence of HREV in upper endoscopy was tested using univariate and multivariate analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for variables associated with HREV. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were included. The prevalence rate of HREV was 50%. Age, gender (female), platelet count, spleen diameter, PC/SD ratio, total bilirrubin, prothrombin activity (INR), Child-Pugh score, clinical and ultrasonographic ascites were significantly associated with presence of HREV in univariate analysis. Age and PC/SD ratio were the parameters independently associated with HREV in a multivariate analysis, with OR 8.81 (CI 95%: 1.7-44.9) and OR 11.21 (CI 95%: 2.8-44.6) respectively. A PC/SD ratio cut-off value under 830.8 predicted HREV with 76.9% sensitivity, 74.2% specificity and 77.8% negative predictive value (ROC curve area: 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: The PC/SD ratio was significantly associated with HREV, but with suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, the results of this study do not support the routine clinical use of PC/SD ratio for screening of HREV.",M1
20008202,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: when a low <e>platelet</e> count is a mandate for anticoagulation.Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated disorder caused by the development of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin. The thrombocytopenia is typically moderate, with a median platelet count nadir of approximately 50 to 60 x 10(9) platelets/L. Severe thrombocytopenia has been described in patients with HIT, and in these patients antibody levels are high and severe clinical outcomes have been reported (eg, disseminated intravascular coagulation with microvascular thrombosis). The timing of the thrombocytopenia in relation to the initiation of heparin therapy is critically important, with the platelet count beginning to drop within 5 to 10 days of starting heparin. A more rapid drop in the platelet count can occur in patients who have been recently exposed to heparin (within the preceding 3 months), due to preformed anti-heparin/PF4 antibodies. A delayed form of HIT has also been described that develops within days or weeks after the heparin has been discontinued. In contrast to other drug-induced thrombocytopenias, HIT is characterized by an increased risk for thromboembolic complications, primarily venous thromboembolism. Heparin and all heparin-containing products should be discontinued and an alternative, non-heparin anticoagulant initiated. Alternative agents that have been used effectively in patients with HIT include lepirudin, argatroban, bivalirudin, and danaparoid, although the last agent is not available in North America. Fondaparinux has been used in a small number of patients with HIT and generally appears to be safe. Warfarin therapy should not be initiated until the platelet count has recovered and the patient is systemically anticoagulated, and vitamin K should be administered to patients receiving warfarin at the time of diagnosis of HIT.",M1
20006397,"Prospective comparison of two algorithms combining non-invasive methods for staging liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis is a challenging area. Several methods have been proposed in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) but their performance may be improved when they are combined as suggested by recently proposed algorithms using either transient elastography (TE) and Fibrotest (FT) (Castera) or AST-to-<e>Platelet</e> Ratio Index (APRI) and FT (SAFE biopsy). The aim of this prospective study was to compare the performance of these two algorithms for diagnosing significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in 302 CHC patients. METHODS: All patients underwent TE, FT and APRI the same day as liver biopsy, taken as reference standard. RESULTS: Significant fibrosis (Metavir F&gt;or=2) was present in 76% of patients and cirrhosis (F4) in 25%. TE failure was observed in eight cases (2.6%). For significant fibrosis, Castera algorithm saved 23% more liver biopsies (71.9% vs. 48.3%, respectively; p&lt;0.0001) than SAFE biopsy but its accuracy was significantly lower (87.7% vs. 97.0%, respectively; p&lt;0.0001). Regarding cirrhosis, accuracy of Castera algorithm was significantly higher than that of SAFE biopsy (95.7% vs. 88.7%, respectively; p&lt;0.0001). The number of saved liver biopsies did not differ between the two algorithms (78.8% vs. 74.8%; p=NS). CONCLUSIONS: Both algorithms are effective for non-invasive staging of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C. Although the number of liver biopsies avoided does not differ between algorithms for diagnosing cirrhosis, it is significantly higher with Castera algorithm than SAFE biopsy for significant fibrosis.",M1
20006168,"Intranasal desmopressin versus blood transfusion in cirrhotic patients with coagulopathy undergoing dental extraction: a randomized controlled trial.PURPOSE: Cirrhotic patients waiting for liver transplantation who need dental extractions are given fresh frozen plasma and/or <e>platelets</e> to correct coagulopathy. This is costly and may be associated with transfusion reactions and fluid overload. We evaluated the efficacy of intranasal desmopressin as an alternative to transfusion to correct the coagulopathy of cirrhotic patients undergoing dental extraction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cirrhotic patients with platelet counts of 30,000 to 50,000/microL and/or international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0 to 3.0 were enrolled in a prospective, controlled, randomized clinical trial. Blood transfusion (fresh frozen plasma 10 mL/kg and/or 1 unit of single donor platelets, respectively) or intranasal desmopressin (300 microg) were given before dental extraction. A standard oral and maxillofacial surgical treatment protocol was performed by the same surgeon. Patients were followed for postextraction bleeding and side-effects over the next 24 to 48 hours. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted between the 2 groups in gender, age, INR, platelet count, creatinine, total bilirubin, ALT, albumin, MELD score, or number of teeth removed (median 3 vs 4). The number of teeth removed ranged between 1 and 31 in the desmopressin group and 1 and 22 in the transfusion group. No patients in desmopressin group required rescue blood transfusion after extraction. One patient in the transfusion group had bleeding after the procedure and required an additional transfusion. Another patient experienced an allergic reaction at the end of transfusion, which was effectively treated with diphenhydramine. Treatment associated average costs were lower for desmopressin ($700/patient) compared with transfusion ($1,173/patient). CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal desmopressin was as effective as blood transfusion in achieving hemostasis in cirrhotic patients with moderate coagulopathy undergoing dental extraction. Intranasal desmopressin was much more convenient, less expensive, and well tolerated.",M1
20003418,"Combination effect of antithrombin and recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin in a lipopolysaccharide induced rat sepsis model.INTRODUCTION: Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhsTM) is newly developed for the treatment of DIC. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the concomitant administration of rhsTM and antithrombin (AT). METHODS: In the first series, rats were treated with either 62.5, 125, 250 or 500 IU/kg (n = 6, each) of AT or 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg (n = 6, each) of rhsTM followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. 8 h later, the fibrinogen level was examined. In the second series, TM group was pretreated with 0.25 mg/kg of rhsTM, AT group was pretreated with 125 IU/kg of AT, AT/TM group was pretreated with both AT and rhsTM, and control group was pretreated with saline (n = 7, each). The <e>platelet</e> count, fibrinogen, ALT, LDH and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels were measured. In addition, histologic changes in liver were examined. In the third series, survival was calculated up to 24 h. RESULTS: Both AT and rhsTM produced a linear dose-response with regard to the fibrinogen level, with 125 IU/kg of AT and 0.25 mg/kg of rhsTM producing equivalent effects. The combined administration of AT and rhsTM significantly reduced the decrease in the platelet count and the fibrinogen level (P &lt; 0.05, 0.01, respectively). The elevations in ALT and LDH were significantly suppressed in all treatment groups. The HMGB1 level and the histologic changes tended to indicate damage reduction. Survival was significantly better only in AT/TM group (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The coadministration of AT and rhsTM might be effective for the treatment of severe sepsis.",M1
20001872,"Effects of saline or albumin resuscitation on standard coagulation tests.AIMS: To explore whether fluid resuscitation with normal saline or 4% albumin is associated with differential changes in routine clinical coagulation tests. DESIGN: Substudy from a large double-blind randomised controlled trial, the SAFE (Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation) study. SETTING: Three general intensive care units. PATIENTS: Cohort of 687 critically ill patients. INTERVENTION: We randomly allocated patients to receive either 4% human albumin or normal saline for fluid resuscitation, and collected demographic and haematological data. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS: Albumin was administered to 338 patients and saline to 349. At baseline, the two groups had similar mean activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 37.2 s (albumin) v 39.1 s (saline); mean international normalised ratio (INR) of 1.38 v 1.34, and mean <e>platelet</e> count of 244 x 10(9)/L v 249 x 10(9)/L. After randomisation, during the first day of treatment, the APTT in the albumin group was prolonged by a mean of 2.7 s, but shortened slightly by a mean of -0.9 s in the saline group. The INR did not change in either group, while the platelet count decreased transiently in both groups. Using multivariate analysis of covariance to account for baseline coagulation status, albumin fluid resuscitation (P = 0.01) and a greater overall volume of resuscitation (P = 0.03) were independently associated with prolongation of APTT during the first day. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of albumin or of larger fluid volumes is associated with a prolongation of APTT. In ICU patients, the choice and amount of resuscitation fluid may affect a routinely used coagulation test.",M1
20001607,"<e>Platelet</e> count less than SHARP: what does a case series reveal?Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in numbers worldwide, and no effective systemic treatment existed for advanced HCC until SHARP (Sorafenib in HCC Assessment Randomized Protocol) study proved sorafenib (Nexavar((R)), Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ, USA) prolonged survival versus placebo. Child-Pugh class A liver function and a platelet count of &gt; or = 60,000/mm(3) were among the inclusion criteria for SHARP.

We report a series of three patients with HCC and platelet count &lt; 60,000/mm(3) who were successfully treated with sorafenib with no complications. We describe the current data on sorafenib and challenges faced in patients with HCC. In addition, we emphasize the need for informed consent when facing factors that predispose to bleeding (esophageal varices, coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia), possible band ligation before the start of sorafenib, careful clinical monitoring and discontinuation of sorafenib when major bleeding occurs.",M1
20000868,"Association between drug and vaccine use and acute immune thrombocytopenia in childhood: a case-control study in Italy.Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an immunomediated disease characterized by a decrease in <e>platelet</e> count and, in its more severe forms, by bleeding symptoms. Many drugs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of drug-induced thrombocytopenia in adults; only limited data on drug-related ITP in children have been published. Our study was set up to evaluate the consistency of the association between drug and vaccine use and ITP in children. This study is part of an Italian multicentre study on adverse drug reactions in children, coordinated by the Italian National Institute of Health, which was started in November 1999 and is ongoing. The study was conducted by enrolling all children aged more than 1 month who were hospitalized through the paediatric emergency department for the following conditions: thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100 x 103/L); acute neurological disorders; non-infectious mucocutaneous diseases and vasculitis; and endoscopically confirmed gastroduodenal lesions and/or clinically defined haematemesis and melaena. Children with chronic pathologies or concomitant diagnoses of cancer or immunodeficiency were not included in our study. During hospital admission, a physician interviewed parents using a structured questionnaire. The main aim of the interview was to collect information on drug exposure in a time period of 3 weeks and vaccine exposure in a period of 6 weeks preceding hospitalization. Using a case-control study design, exposure of children with thrombocytopenia (cases) to drugs and vaccines was compared with similar exposure of children with gastroduodenal lesions and neurological disorders (controls); this allowed us to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of the occurrence of thrombocytopenia associated with the use of drugs or vaccines. Up to December 2007, the study population included 387 cases of thrombocytopenia and 1924 controls. Despite the low platelet count, ITP was generally a mild disease, without serious bleeding in the majority of cases and associated with a short length of hospital stay. After adjusting for concurrent use of other drugs, use of the antibacterials was associated with a more than 2-fold increase in the risk of developing ITP (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.8, 3.1). Mucolytics and NSAIDs were associated with an OR of 1.9; 95% CI 1.2, 2.9 and 1.5; 95% CI 1.0, 2.1 respectively, while paracetamol (acetaminophen) was associated with an OR of 1.5; 95% CI 1.2, 2.0. MMR vaccination was associated with an increased risk of developing ITP (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2, 4.7). The results of this study provide evidence for an association between ITP and exposure to selected antibacterials, NSAIDs, paracetamol, mucolytics and MMR vaccination.",M1
19997800,"Effect of thrombopoietin on <e>platelet</e> counts and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in a rat model.PURPOSE: We investigated the effects of thrombopoietin (TPO) on platelet counts and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats. METHODS: We performed 70% partial hepatectomy on 60 rats given either TPO or a vehicle (controls). The rats were killed 6 h, 24 h, 72 h, or 168 h after the procedure, and we examined the platelet counts, weight of the regenerated liver, hepatocyte proliferation by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling index, and expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In the controls, the platelet counts were significantly lower than the basal levels, by about 20%, at 6, 24, and 72 h; then recovered to the basal level at 168 h. Conversely, in the TPO-treated rats, the platelet counts increased significantly by 17%, 35%, and 60%, at 24, 72, and 168 h, respectively. The regenerated liver regained 80% of the pre-hepatectomy weight by 72 h in the controls, whereas reconstitution of the liver was accomplished by 72 h in the TPO-treated rats. Thrombopoietin significantly enhanced the BrdU labeling index of hepatocytes and expression of HGF mRNA 24 h post hepatectomy in TPO-treated rats versus controls. CONCLUSION: Thrombopoietin increased platelet counts; thereby accelerating liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy with enhanced induction of HGF.",M1
19996742,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and cardiac surgery.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an important, increasingly recognized antibody-mediated complication of heparin therapy occurring in approximately 0.5-5% of patients receiving heparin for at least 5 days. HIT is a prothrombotic disorder that typically presents with a 50% <e>platelet</e> count drop, thrombotic event manifesting usually 5-14 days after starting heparin, or both. HIT antibodies usually decrease to negative titers/levels within 3 months. When there is clinical suspicion of HIT, heparin should be discontinued and alternative anticoagulation should be considered, as well as laboratory evaluation for HIT. RECENT FINDINGS: HIT immunoassay results should be used for clinical decision-making about initial anticoagulation management. Recent data reevaluate the importance of absolute titers of HIT antibodies as a risk factor for clinical occurrence. Although laboratory assays are routinely used, current data suggest that increasing optical densities are more likely associated with a positive 14C-serotonin release assay and HIT. HIT is also associated with a greater risk for adverse events, so even though alternative anticoagulation is used, clinicians should be aware of this hypercoagulable syndrome. SUMMARY: For patients with HIT, alternative anticoagulation is available, but for cardiovascular surgery, if the operation cannot be delayed until HIT antibodies have become negative, alternative anticoagulation strategies are recommended, although patients with HIT are at a greater risk for adverse outcomes.",M1
19996737,"Association between plasma asymmetrical dimethylarginine activity and saphenous vein graft disease in patients with coronary bypass.BACKGROUND: Coronary vein graft disease is an important contributor to the morbidity after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Graft occlusion is a serious complication, which limits the use of the saphenous vein as a coronary bypass conduit. Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase and it reduces the bioavailability of nitric oxide and begets endothelial dysfunction. The goal of this study was to examine the association between plasma ADMA activity and saphenous vein graft disease. METHODS: One hundred and three patients were enrolled in this study. Group 1 consisted of 42 patients (13 female, 29 male) who had diseased saphenous vein grafts and group 2 consisted of 61 patients (10 female, 51 male) with nondiseased saphenous vein grafts. ADMA activity was measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. RESULTS: Mean ADMA activity in group 1 was significantly higher than in group 2 (2.0+/-0.6 vs. 1.1+/-0.5 micromol/l, P&lt;0.001, respectively). Mean <e>platelet</e> volume was also significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (8.7+/-1.5 vs. 8.2+/-0.6 fl, P=0.03, respectively). In a multivariate linear regression analysis, ADMA activity (beta=2.902, P&lt;0.001) and mean platelet volume (beta=0.595, P=0.03) were found to be independent predictors of saphenous vein graft disease. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that ADMA activity was higher in patients with saphenous vein graft disease. Increased ADMA activity might lead to the acceleration of saphenous vein graft disease. ADMA may be a precious marker for detecting late saphenous vein graft patency.",M1
19969492,"Proteinase-activated receptor (PAR1) polymorphic variant correlates with thrombocytopenia in Gaucher disease.BACKGROUND: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Gaucher disease is safe and effectively corrects hepatosplenomegaly and hypersplenism; however, thrombocytopenia, may not normalize. <e>Platelet</e> proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) are signaling effectors in response to inflammation; PAR1 expression is down-regulated during inflammation and may be associated with thrombocytopenia. Accumulation of undegraded lipids in macrophages in Gaucher disease induces a chronic state of inflammation. The purpose of this study was to describe PAR1 polymorphic genotypes in patients with Gaucher disease and ascertain whether these are correlated with platelet counts. METHODS: Helsinki Committee approval was received for this study. Blood samples were taken from 80 patients with non-neuronopathic disease, some on ERT, and from 44 healthy Jewish controls. PAR1 polymorphisms IVS[-14(A/T)], and [-506(I/D)] and [-1426(C/T)] were analyzed. Patient data were collected from the files. Associations between PAR1 and categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square and Fisher's exact tests; assessment of associations with quantitative variables used ANOVA and Scheffe post-hoc for multiple pair-wise comparisons. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was used when one category was small. All tests were 2-tailed; p values &lt;/= 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference (p=0.015) between patients and controls for [-1426(C/T)]TT genotype. There was no significant correlation for [-1426(C/T)] with disease severity, need for ERT, splenectomy, or presence of bone disease; rather, there was a significant correlation between lower platelet counts (p=0.0003) and the [-1426(C/T)]TT genotype and a trend for correlation with inflammation markers (p=0.079). There was a statistically significant correlation for [-506(I/D)]II genotype with femoral neck bone density (p=0.034). All patients carried the wild type for IVS[-14(A/T)]. CONCLUSION: The [-1426(C/T)] polymorphic variant of PAR1 is associated with thrombocytopenia in Gaucher disease.",M1
19966641,"Evaluation of association between precolectomy thrombocytosis and the occurrence of inflammatory pouch disorders.BACKGROUND: There are inconsistencies regarding the risk factors associated with pouchitis and Crohn's disease of the pouch after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between precolectomy routine laboratory tests, including <e>platelet</e> counts, and occurrences of inflammatory pouch disorders. METHODS: All eligible patients were included from The Pouchitis Clinic. All patients undergoing ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis were included if their preoperative laboratory tests were available. Demographic, clinical, endoscopic, and laboratory tests were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 251 patients were included. Fifty-five patients had acute pouchitis and 29 had chronic pouchitis. Forty-two patients were diagnosed with Crohn's disease of the pouch. In multivariate analysis, elevated platelet count was not associated with chronic pouchitis (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-2.59; P = 0.86) or Crohn's disease of the pouch (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-1.97, P = 0.73) after adjusting for gender, smoking, extraintestinal manifestations, and pouch duration. Active smoking was associated with Crohn's disease of the pouch (odds ratio, 5.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.98-16.1; P = 0.001). No other laboratory tests, including white blood cell counts, albumin levels, and hemoglobin levels, were associated with the pouch outcomes. The presence of extraintestinal manifestations was associated with acute pouchitis (odds ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.14; P = 0.05) and chronic pouchitis (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-5.87; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Precolectomy laboratory tests, including platelet counts, did not appear to impact the occurrence of inflammatory pouch disorders after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.",M1
19966166,"Hyperleptinemia in horses: responses to administration of a small dose of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin in mares and geldings.Mares and geldings in good body condition selected for hyperleptinemia vs. normal leptin concentrations were studied to determine whether the hyperleptinemic condition affected various characteristics of the hematologic and hormonal systems after a challenge with lipopolysaccharide endotoxin. Four mares and 4 geldings that were determined to be hyperleptinemic (mean plasma leptin concentrations of 10.0 to 15.5 ng/mL) and 4 mares and 4 geldings with mean plasma leptin concentrations between 2.4 and 5.5 ng/mL were administered Escherichia coli O55:B5 endotoxin (35 ng/kg of BW in 500 mL of saline over a 30-min infusion), or saline only, in pairs in a single-switchback design, with horses and treatments randomly assigned for the first infusion. Physiological variables and blood components were monitored for 24 h after the onset of infusions. Treatments were switched and the second infusions were administered 8 d later. Relative to vehicle infusion, endotoxin infusion increased (P &lt; 0.01) the rectal temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, plasma total protein concentration, and blood packed cell volume; there was an interaction of leptin status, endotoxin treatment, and time for heart rate (P = 0.039), respiration rate (P = 0.018), and plasma total protein concentration (P = 0.054). Blood concentrations of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils all decreased (P &lt; 0.001) after endotoxin infusion; there was an interaction (P = 0.0057) between sex and leptin status for blood <e>platelet</e> concentration. Plasma leptin concentrations increased (P = 0.013) after endotoxin infusion in both hyperleptinemic horses and those with reduced leptin concentrations. There were interactions (P &lt; 0.037) of sex with endotoxin treatment and time for plasma concentrations of cortisol and prolactin, whereas plasma GH concentrations were affected (increased; P &lt; 0.001) only by time after infusion. Given that the effects of hyperleptinemia were generally minor, it was concluded that the hyperleptinemic condition, and its associated type-2 diabetic symptoms, has a minimal impact on the components of the hematologic and hormonal systems studied.",M1

BMSCs of 8 Wistar rats (male or female, weighing 250-300 g) were isolated and cultured. The 5th passage of BMSCs were co-cultured with PAC at the density of 1 x 10(6) cells/mL to fabricate the tissue engineered composite PACB in vitro. Forty healthy Wistar rats were made bilateral bone defects in femoral condyles and divided into 4 groups (A, B, C and D, n=10). The defects were filled with equivalent PACB, PAC, AC and Col I in groups A, B, C and D respectively. At 4 weeks, the defect repair was evaluated with radiology, histology, ALP biochemical tests. RESULTS: At 4 weeks, the bone density measurement was (7.31 +/- 0.54), (4.36 +/- 0.67), (2.12 +/- 0.47), and (1.09 +/- 0.55) pixels in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. The area of new bone formation in defect area under single view was (412.82 +/- 22.31), (266.57 +/- 17.22), (94.34 +/- 20.22), and (26.12 +/- 12.51) pixels in groups A, B, C and D respectively. The ALP contents in femoral condyles were (94.31 +/- 7.54), (69.88 +/- 4.12), (41.33 +/- 3.46), and (21.03 +/- 3.11) U/L, respectively. The above indexes of group A were significantly higher than those of groups B, C or D (P &lt; 0.05). Three-color flow cytometry assay showed that the T lymphocyte subsets of CD3(+)CD4(+)CD8(-), CD3(+)CD8(+)CD4(-), and the ratio of CD4/CD8 displayed no significant difference among four groups (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Tissue engineered bone PACB is capable to promote the bone defect repair.",M1
19955713,"Intracranial hemorrhage in acute and chronic childhood immune thrombocytopenic purpura over a ten-year period: an Egyptian multicenter study.Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a rare but major cause of death in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The authors reviewed data of 1,840 patient with ITP, from 5 pediatric hematology centers in Egypt from 1997 to 2007, to study the incidence and risk factors of ICH. Ten cases of ICH were identified with a median age at presentation of 7.5 years; 4 patients had acute ITP, 2 persistent and 4 chronic. The <e>platelet</e> count was &lt;10 x 10(9)/l in 7 cases, and only 1 patient had a history of head trauma. Seven children were on treatment prior to or at the time of occurrence of ICH and all were treated by pharmacotherapy. Two children died shortly afterwards due to late referral to a specialized center. Our results suggest that treatment does not prevent ICH and that it can occur at any time during the course of the disease. Delayed referral can be considered a risk factor for unfavorable outcome of ICH, highlighting the importance of teaching sessions for patients and their parents to minimize subsequent morbidity and mortality of ICH in children with ITP.",M1
19950810,"Is there any non-invasive marker replace the needle liver biopsy predictive for liver fibrosis, in patients with chronic hepatitis?BACKGROUND/AIMS: Non-invasive serum markers are being used to determine fibrosis score as an alternative to liver biopsy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy and predictive value of the non-invasive markers in identifying the presence or absence of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis. METHODOLOGY: A total of 557 patients (401 chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 156 chronic hepatitis C (CHC)) were enrolled into the study retrospectively. Liver biopsies were evaluated histopathologically according to the Knodell scoring system. Laboratory values such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), y-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) and <e>platelet</e> count (PLT) was tested on the same day of liver biopsy. Using these laboratory values, AST/ALT ratio (AAR), age-platelet index (API) and AST/ PLT ratio index (APRI), GGT/PLT ratio index (GAPI) and AST to GGT ratio (AGR) were calculated. RESULTS: Advanced liver fibrosis including stage 3-4 was observed in 197 (49%) of patients with CHB, 84 (54%) of patients with CHC. Mean age and GGT were higher and PLT was lower in patients with advanced liver fibrosis (stage 3-4) than those in patients with absence of significant fibrosis (stage 0-1) (p &lt; 0.001). But, there was no statistically significant relationship for mean value of AST and ALT between patients with stage 0-1 and stage 3-4. The API and GAPI were found to be significantly associated with the fibrosis score and correlation co-efficient (r) were 0.35 and 0.23, respectively (p &lt; 0.001), while the APRI, AAR and AGR values were not associated with the fibrosis score in all of the patients (p &gt; 0.05). But, APRI has showed correlation with liver fibrosis in patients with CHC contrary to patients with CHB. CONCLUSION: Age, GGT, PLT, API and GAPI are significantly associated with the extent of fibrosis. But these non-invasive markers can not replace liver biopsy.",M1
19946731,"Hepatic senescence marker protein-30 is involved in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.BACKGROUND: Both insulin resistance and increased oxidative stress in the liver are associated with the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30) was initially identified as a novel protein in the rat liver, and acts as an antioxidant and antiapoptotic protein. Our aim was to determine whether hepatic SMP30 levels are associated with the development and progression of NAFLD. METHODS: Liver biopsies and blood samples were obtained from patients with an NAFLD activity score (NAS) &lt; or = 2 (n = 18), NAS of 3-4 (n = 14), and NAS &gt; or = 5 (n = 66). RESULTS: Patients with NAS &gt; or = 5 had significantly lower hepatic SMP30 levels (12.5 +/- 8.4 ng/mg protein) than patients with NAS &lt; or = 2 (30.5 +/- 14.2 ng/mg protein) and patients with NAS = 3-4 (24.6 +/- 12.2 ng/mg protein). Hepatic SMP30 decreased in a fibrosis stage-dependent manner. Hepatic SMP30 levels were correlated positively with the <e>platelet</e> count (r = 0.291) and negatively with the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (r = -0.298), the net electronegative charge modified-low-density lipoprotein (r = -0.442), and type IV collagen 7S (r = -0.350). The immunostaining intensity levels of 4-hydroxynonenal in the liver were significantly and inversely correlated with hepatic SMP30 levels. Both serum large very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and very small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in patients with NAS &gt; or = 5 were significantly higher than those seen in patients with NAS &lt; or = 2, and these lipoprotein fractions were significantly and inversely correlated with hepatic SMP30. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that hepatic SMP30 is closely associated with the pathogenesis of NAFLD, although it is not known whether decreased hepatic SMP30 is a result or a cause of cirrhosis.",M1
19945267,"Spinal subarachnoid hematoma following spinal anesthesia in a patient with HELLP syndrome.A case of subarachnoid hematoma following spinal anesthesia for cesarean section in a patient with HELLP syndrome is reported. A 39-year-old woman underwent cesarean section under spinal anesthesia for worsening preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome. Despite full recovery from the spinal anesthetic, on the second postoperative day she felt numbness on the posterior aspect of her right leg, noticed she was insensitive to bladder fullness and had mild flaccid paraparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a spinal subarachnoid hematoma with cauda equina compression. With conservative management she made an almost complete recovery within three months. Serial magnetic resonance imaging showed spontaneous regression of the hematoma. The risk of spinal subarachnoid hematoma following obstetric regional anesthesia is exceedingly small even in a patient with coagulopathy and, to our knowledge, this is only the second reported case following obstetric regional anesthesia. Anesthesia for HELLP syndrome in patients with an adequate <e>platelet</e> count but without disseminated intravascular coagulation is controversial. It is therefore important for clinicians to recognize the symptoms and signs of spinal subarachnoid hematoma to avoid delay in treatment that might result in severe neurological deficit.",M1
19936602,"Strong CD8(+) T-cell responses against tumor-associated antigens prolong the recurrence-free interval after tumor treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.AIM: We investigated whether tumor-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses affect tumor-free survival as well as the relationship between CD8(+) T-cell responses against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and the clinical course after tumor treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Twenty patients with HCC that were treated by radiofrequency ablation or trans-catheter chemo-embolization (TACE) and in whom HCC was undetectable by ultrasonography, CT, and/or MRI 1 month after treatment were enrolled in the study. Before and after treatment for HCC, analyses of TAA (glypican-3, NY-ESO-1, and MAGE-1)-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were evaluated with an interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay using peripheral CD8(+) T-cells, monocytes, and 104 types of 20-mer synthetic peptide overlapping by 10 residues and spanning the entirety of the 3 TAAs. RESULTS: Sixteen out of 20 patients (80%) showed a positive response (&gt; or = 10 TAA-specific cells/10(5) CD8(+) T-cells) before or after treatment. When we performed univariate analysis of prognostic factors for the tumor-free period in the 20 patients, <e>platelet</e> count, prothrombin time, and the number of TAA-specific CD8(+) T-cells after treatment were significant factors (P = 0.027, 0.030, and 0.004, respectively). In multivariate analysis, the magnitude of the TAA-specific CD8(+) T-cell response (&gt; or = 40 TAA-specific cells/10(5) CD8(+) T-cells) was the only significant prognostic factor for a prolonged tumor-free interval (hazard ratio 0.342, P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that strong TAA-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses suppress the recurrence of HCC. Immunotherapy to induce TAA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes by means such as the use of peptide vaccines should be considered for clinical application in patients with HCC after local therapy.",M1
19933539,"Plasmapheresis and heparin reexposure as a management strategy for cardiac surgical patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) complicates the management of patients presenting for cardiac surgery, because high-dose heparin anticoagulation for cardiopulmonary bypass is contraindicated in these patients. Alternative anticoagulants are available, but there are concerns about dosing, efficacy, monitoring, thrombosis, and hemorrhage. METHODS: A retrospective chart review between November 2004 and March 2008 retrieved perioperative clinical and laboratory data for 11 adult cardiac surgical patients with a preoperative history of HIT and a current positive antiheparin/<e>platelet</e> factor 4 (anti-HPF4) antibody titer, who were managed with plasmapheresis and heparin anticoagulation. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) preoperative anti-HPF4 antibody titer was 0.8 (0.7-2.2). Three of the 11 patients (27%) died of causes unrelated to HIT and 1 of these patients (9%) developed an ischemic foot, in the setting of cardiogenic shock, not thought to be HIT-related. A single plasmapheresis treatment reduced titers by 50%-84%, and 6 patients had negative titers after treatment; none of the 3 patients with reduced titers developed clinical HIT. CONCLUSIONS: This case series describes an alternative management strategy using intraoperative plasmapheresis for patients presenting for cardiac surgery with acute or subacute HIT. Reducing antibody load can potentially decrease the thrombotic risk associated with high anti-HPF4 titers and decrease the urgency to initiate postoperative anticoagulation in this patient group at high risk of postoperative bleeding.",M1
19929930,"Laparoscopic splenectomy may be a superior supportive intervention for cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To evaluate and compare laparoscopic splenectomy and partial splenic embolization as supportive intervention for cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism to overcome peripheral cytopenia before the initiation of and during interferon therapy or anticancer therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: Between December 2000 and April 2008, 43 Japanese cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism underwent either laparoscopic splenectomy or partial splenic embolization as a supportive intervention to facilitate the initiation and completion of either interferon therapy or anticancer therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. We reviewed the peri- and post-intervention outcomes and details of the subsequent planned main therapies. For interferon therapy, the rate of completion, the rate of treatment cessation and virological responses were evaluated. Anti-cancer therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma included liver resection, ablation therapy, intra-arterial chemotherapy, and transarterial chemoembolization. RESULTS: All patients tolerated the operations well with no significant complications. The <e>platelet</e> count was significantly higher in the laparoscopic splenectomy group than in the partial splenic embolization group at 1 and 2 weeks after the intervention. Interferon therapy was stopped in two patients in the partial splenic embolization group due to recurrent thrombocytopenia whereas all patients in the laparoscopic splenectomy group completed interferon therapy. The planned anticancer therapies were performed in all patients, and were completed in all patients without any problems or major complications. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic splenectomy may be superior to partial splenic embolization as a supportive intervention for cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism. Future prospective, randomized controlled patient studies are required to confirm these findings.",M1
19926118,"A review of 122 published outcomes of danaparoid anticoagulation for intermittent haemodialysis.One hundred and twenty-two case reports of treatment outcomes of danaparoid use for intermittent haemodialysis (HD) in severely ill patients with heparin intolerance (including 97 HIT patients) have been analysed. HD sessions of 4 - 6 hours were successfully conducted daily to 3 times/week for periods of up to 4 years (median 7 sessions/patient (range 1 - &gt;650). In these patients danaparoid use was relatively safe (4 unprovoked non-fatal major bleeds) and efficacious in protecting the circuit (95% no clotting problem) or patient (6 thromboses: 4 fatal or leading to danaparoid discontinuation). HIT diagnosis was improved if recurrent <e>platelet</e> count reduction with each HD and circuit/AV graft clotting were included. Alternative reasons for and very low nadirs of the platelet count undermined the usefulness of the 4 T pre-test HIT predictability scores, but a positive functional serological test confirmed HIT in most patients. Deaths (15.6%) and thrombosis only occurred in HIT cases. Possible reasons are discussed. Replacing the standard intermittent pre-HD dose regimen with the therapeutic infusion regimen to provide continuous daily systemic antithrombotic protection, should further improve efficacy. CONCLUSION: Danaparoid appears to be a useful alternative antithrombotic for patients with heparin intolerance and renal failure requiring haemodialysis.",M1
19924028,"Severe gastrointestinal bleeding and thrombocytopenia in a child with an anti-GATA1 autoantibody.We describe a patient, who developed during the first week of life petechiae and hematomas caused by severe thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding due to multiple small gastric hemangiomata. Bone marrow examination showed hypermegakaryocytosis and dysmegakaryopoiesis. Alloimmune thrombocytopenia was excluded. Only 3 y later, <e>platelet</e> counts normalized and bleedings disappeared but small skin hemangiomata remained. Electron microscopy showed enlarged round platelets with a paucity of alpha granules similar as in GATA1-deficient patients but no GATA1 mutation was found. Immunoblot analysis showed a strong interaction between patient Igs and recombinant GATA1, GATA2, and the N finger (Nf) of GATA1. The lymphocyte transformation test with recombinant GATA1Nf was positive. In vitro culturing of normal CD34 cells with purified patient Igs showed a decreased number of megakaryocyte colonies but an increased overall size of the colonies compared with control Igs. Mice injected with patient Igs showed a reduced platelet count compared with mice injected with control Igs. Thrombopoiesis was also reduced after injection of patient Igs in transgenic zebrafish compared with control Igs. In conclusion, this study is the first report of an anti-GATA1 autoantibody leading to severe thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding from multiple pinpoint hemangiomata.",M1
19922883,"Retrospective cohort chart review study of factors associated with the development of thrombocytopenia in adult Japanese patients who received intravenous linezolid therapy.BACKGROUND: Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic agent active against Gram-positive bacteria. It has been associated with hematologic adverse effects such as thrombocytopenia. Little is known about the mechanism underlying thrombocytopenia in patients who receive intravenous linezolid. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the risk factors associated with the development of thrombocytopenia in adult Japanese patients who received intravenous linezolid therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of the medical charts of patients who were treated with linezolid 600 mg IV BID (q12h) between June 2006 and March 2008 at Gifu University Hospital in Gifu, Japan. Data were extracted from the electronic medical records obtained from a central database in the hospital. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a decrease in <e>platelet</e> count of &gt; or = 25% and a final platelet count of &lt;100 x 10(3)/mm3. Risk factors associated with thrombocytopenia in patients who received linezolid were identified via logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In total, 42 patients (31 men and 11 women; mean [SD] age, 59.6 [12.8] years [range, 33-85 years]) were included in the study. The mean duration of linezolid therapy was 13.6 (10.1) days, with a range of 3 to 48 days. Seven patients with renal insufficiency received hemodialysis before linezolid infusion. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 7 patients (16.7%). Among the 7 patients with renal insufficiency, 2 patients (28.6%) developed severe thrombocytopenia, requiring platelet transfusion. In univariate analysis, a high daily dose of &gt; or = 22 mg/kg (odds ratio [OR] = 20.25; 95% CI, 2.115-193.9; P = 0.009), low baseline platelet count of &lt;200 x 10(3)/mm3 (OR = 8.437; 95% CI, 1.367-52.06), and lowered creatinine clearance of &lt;30 mL/min (OR = 6.444; 95% CI, 1.136-36.57) were significant factors for thrombocytopenia associated with linezolid therapy; however, in multivariate analysis, only daily dose (&gt; or = 22 mg/kg) was a significant risk factor for thrombocytopenia associated with linezolid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The daily dose of &gt; or = 22 mg/kg was a significant risk factor associated with thrombocytopenia in patients who received linezolid therapy. Prospective studies comparing the efficacy and safety profile of linezolid in patients receiving a conventional dose (600 mg q12h) and those receiving a weight-adjusted dose are needed to determine an adequate dose of linezolid, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency or low baseline platelet count.",M1
19918023,"Impact of xenon anaesthesia in isolated cardiopulmonary bypass on very early leucocyte and <e>platelet</e> activation and clearance: a randomized, controlled study.BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with leucocyte and platelet activation and also organ dysfunction. Xenon has been found to have organ-protective effects. We therefore investigated the effect of isolated CPB on leucocyte and platelet activation and the efficacy of xenon in inhibiting these changes. METHODS: Isolated CPB was conducted according to strict standardized clinical criteria using blood from healthy volunteers. They were randomized to an air-oxygen mixture (control group) vs xenon-oxygen mixture (xenon group). Blood samples were drawn at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min from commencement of circuits and analysed for haemoglobin concentrations, white cell, neutrophil, monocyte, lymphocyte, and platelet counts. Leucocyte and platelet activation and also complex formation were determined by measuring levels of CD14++ monocytes, CD16+ monocytes, platelet-monocyte complexes, and platelet-neutrophil complexes (PNC). Differences between and within the groups were analysed with Student's t-test. RESULTS: Biomarker levels were not different between the groups. The data were pooled to identify the effects of isolated bypass. The neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, CD14++ monocytes, and CD16+ monocytes decreased within 5 min of the bypass experiments, whereas the percentage of platelet-CD++ monocyte complexes and PNC increased. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated CPB elicited rapid, substantial leucocyte and platelet activation, and xenon had no impact on inhibiting these changes.",M1
19917581,"Severe Thrombocytopenia in the NICU.OBJECTIVE: Severe thrombocytopenia (<e>platelets</e> &lt;or= 50000/microL) in a NICU patient can have significant consequences; however, previous reports have not focused exclusively on NICU patients with counts this low. METHODS: We identified all patients with severe thrombocytopenia who were cared for in the Intermountain Healthcare level III NICUs from 2003-2007. RESULTS: Among 11281 NICU admissions, severe thrombocytopenia was identified in 273 (2.4%). Just over 30% of these presented in the first three days of life. Half presented by day 10, 75% by day 27, and 95% by day 100. The prevalence was inversely related to birth weight. Cutaneous bleeding was more common in patients with platelet counts of &lt;20000/microL; however, no statistically significant correlation was found between platelet counts and pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or intraventricular bleeding. The most common explanations for severe thrombocytopenia were acquired varieties of consumptive thrombocytopenia. Platelet transfusions (median 5, range 0-76) were administered to 86% of the patients. No deaths were ascribed to exsanguinations. The mortality rate did not correlate with the lowest platelet count but was proportionate to the number of platelet transfusions. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of severe thrombocytopenia in the NICU is inversely proportional to birth weight and most cases are acquired consumptive thrombocytopenias. We speculate that very low platelet counts are a causal factor in cutaneous bleeding, but pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and intraventricular bleeding are less influenced by the platelet count and occur primarily from causes other than severe thrombocytopenia. The lowest platelet count does not predict the mortality rate but the number of platelet transfusions received does.",M1
19917385,"Remission of splenic volume in the recipient during the course of adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation: evaluation using multislice computed tomography and semiautomatic software.AIM: The purpose of the study was to examine changes in splenic volume among recipients during the course of adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) using multislice computed tomography (CT) scanning with a semiautomatic volumetry software. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients, including 33 males and a mean overall age of 54 +/- 8 years), underwent liver transplantation for the primary disease of liver cirrhosis with or without hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 31/17, respectively). The mean MELD score was 14 +/- 6. The liver graft mass compared with recipient weight was 74% +/- 28%. Splenic artery embolization was not performed. Dynamic CT scans splenic volume, and <e>platelet</e> counts (10(3)/cm(3)) were obtained pre, &lt; or =50 day and &gt; or =90 days postoperatively. RESULTS: The total time to generate volumetry and image postprocessing per examination was &lt;10 minutes. One-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the average splenic volume tended to be reduced from pre- to post-LDLT, although not significantly: pre-LDLT, 469 +/- 270 mL; &lt; or =day 50, 369 +/- 212 mL; and &gt; or =day 90, 378 +/- 210 mL (P = .066). One-factor ANOVA revealed that the average platelet count was significantly different in the 3 periods: pre-LDLT, 69 +/- 32 x 10(3)/cm(3); &lt; or =day 50, 181 +/- 253 x 10(3)/cm(3); and &gt; or =day 90, 126 +/- 64 x 10(3)/cm(3) (P &lt; .01).

19909427,"Prothrombotic and inflammatory effects of intravenous administration of human immunoglobulin G in dogs.BACKGROUND: Intravenous administration of human immunoglobulin G (hIVIgG) has been suggested to potentiate thromboembolism in dogs, but supportive scientific reports are lacking. Objectives: To determine if hIVIgG therapy promotes hypercoagulability and inflammation in dogs. ANIMALS: Twelve healthy Beagle dogs. METHODS: Prospective, experimental trial. An hIVIgG/saline solution was infused IV at 1 g/kg BW over 8 hours to 6 dogs, and physiological saline was infused to the other 6 dogs. Blood samples were drawn before, during, and after infusion for serial measurement of indicators of coagulation and inflammation. Data were analyzed by 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Dogs administered hIVIgG developed mildly decreased blood <e>platelet</e> concentrations without thrombocytopenia (median, 200 x 10(3)/microL; range, 150-302 x 10(3)/microL; P &lt; .01), leukopenia (median, 3.5 x 10(3)/microL; range, 20-62 x 10(3)/microL; P &lt; .001), and mildly increased plasma total protein concentrations (median, 6.3 g/dL; range, 5.6-6.7 g/dL; P &lt; .001).

The aim of this study was to evaluate triple dose platelet collection with respect to feasibility and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred eighty plateletphereses were performed targeting to collect a triple platelet dose. Platelet counts were performed before and after apheresis and in platelet concentrates. Furthermore, donors were monitored for adverse events. RESULTS: Triple dose platelet collection was achieved in 96% according to European and national guidelines. Mean donor platelet count before apheresis was 303 +/- 64/nl and decreased to 195 +/- 48/nl after plateletpheresis. The lowest platelet count after apheresis was 111/nl. Twenty-one donor adverse events were observed (4.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Triple dose platelet collection is feasible and safe provided that donors are carefully checked for triple dose eligibility.",M1
19908301,"Outcome of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in children.BACKGROUND: There is paucity of data on long-term probability of remission in chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Aim was to study the course and factors influencing remission of chronic ITP. Chronic ITP was defined as thrombocytopenia persisting &gt;6 months following initial diagnosis. PROCEDURES: Case-records of children with chronic ITP, aged &lt;14 years, were reviewed in this retrospective study (1987-2006). RESULTS: Two hundred seventy children were followed. Median age at diagnosis was 6 years. Median duration of follow up was 30 months (range 6-166). Isolated thrombocytopenia (even if &lt;10 x 10(9)/L) in the absence of  significant  bleeds, by itself was not considered an indication for drug therapy. Sixty-seven (24.8%) children attained complete remission (CR) over a median period of 18 months (range 7-120). The probabilities of remission at 5 years for males and females were 24% and 39.6%, respectively (P = 0.01). The probability of achieving remission at 10 years in children &lt;8 and &gt; or =8 years was 51.2% and 34%, respectively (P = 0.02). The probability of remission at 5 years for children who received some treatment, versus no treatment was 31.4% and 27%, respectively (P = 0.8). Nine of 18 children, who underwent splenectomy, achieved CR. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurred in 11 (4%) cases. The time of occurrence of ICH from onset of symptoms varied from 6 to 55 months. CONCLUSIONS: The predicted spontaneous remission rate with chronic ITP was 30% and 44% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. <e>Platelet</e> count at diagnosis and the treatment administered did not influence remission outcomes. Age &lt;8 years and female gender were predictors of a favorable outcome.",M1

METHODS: Mouse tumor rejection model induced by a single dose of melphalan was used in this experiment. Different gene-type tumor-bearing mice (IFN-gamma(+/-) and IFN-gamma(-/-)), which had the same genetic background of C57BL/6, were treated intraperitoneally with melphalan (7.5 mg/kg). Tumor size was observed and recorded every one to three days in these different gene-type mice subsequently. Blood samples were obtained from orbital venous sinus on different days before and after melphalan treatment, and then complete blood counts were performed. The function of IFN-gamma on the efficacy of chemotherapy and the changes of blood platelet count in IFN-gamma(+/-) and IFN-gamma(-/-) mice after melphalan treatment was analyzed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in tumor sizes and blood platelet count between IFN-gamma(-/-) and IFN-gamma(+/-) mice (P&gt;0.05). On the first day after melphalan (7.5 mg/kg) treatment, there were no significant changes in tumor sizes between mice in these two groups (P&gt;0.05). Tumors shrank a little in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice and then grew gradually. Tumors relapsed in 2 w after melphalan injection in all IFN-gamma(-/-) mice, while tumor volumes decreased progressively and tumor cured at last in IFN-gamma(+/-) mice. The number of blood PLT in IFN-gamma(+/-) mice increased to (1935+/-378) x 10(9)/L 6 h after melphalan treatment, significantly higher than before (P&lt;0.01); While in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice it was (1183+/-186) x 10(9)/L 6 h after melphalan treatment, no obvious increase than before. There was significant difference in blood PLT 6 h after melphalan treatment between IFN-gamma(+/-) and IFN-gamma(-/-) mice (P&lt;0.01). Later, the numbers of blood PLT in IFN-gamma(+/-) mice decreased gradually and it dropped to normal (1158+/-270) x 10(9)/L on 11th day after melphalan treatment (P&gt;0.05); While it sustained in normal range in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice. There was no significant difference in blood platelet count between IFN-gamma(-/-) and IFN-gamma(+/-) mice. CONCLUSION: Peripheral blood platelet count increased on the first day after melphalan treatment and tumors cured in IFN-gamma(+/-) mice; While tumors relapsed and there is no increase in blood platelet count on the first day after melphalan treatment in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice. These data indicated that the increase of blood PLT count was related to the function of IFN-gamma in tumor-bearing mice in vivo during tumor rejection induced by a low dose of melphalan.",M1
19897578,"Combination immunosuppressant therapy for patients with chronic refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura.Treatment options for patients with chronic refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) are limited. Because combination immunosuppressant therapy appeared to be effective in ITP and other disorders, we used this approach in patients with particularly severe and refractory ITP. In this retrospective, observational study, we determined the response (<e>platelet</e> count above 30 x 10(9)/L and doubling of baseline) among 19 refractory ITP patients. Treatment consisted of azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine. The patients had failed a median of 6 prior treatments, including splenectomy (in all except 1). Of 19 patients, 14 (73.7%) achieved a response lasting a median of 24 months, after which time 8 (57.1%) relapsed. Of the 8 relapsing patients, 6 responded to additional treatments. Of the 14 patients who achieved an initial response, 2 (14.3%) remained in remission after eventually stopping all medications. Severe adverse events did not occur. Combination immunosuppressant therapy can produce a rise in the platelet count that is sometimes sustained in refractory ITP patients.",M1

20575035,"Normal ranges of angiogenesis regulatory proteins in human <e>platelets</e>.Platelets sequester angiogenesis regulatory proteins early in tumor growth, which suggests a new avenue for monitoring disease. To date, there are no clinically relevant reference ranges for markers of early angiogenesis. We introduce a new ELISA-based method for accurate and reproducible measurement of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), platelet factor 4 (PF4), thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), fibroblast growth factor, basic (bFGF), and endostatin in platelets. To facilitate clinical applicability, the platelet levels in isolated samples were determined utilizing a new actin ELISA method. Platelets from healthy donors at single and repetitive time points were used for the assessment of normal ranges of these proteins. The physiological levels in platelets were: VEGF (0.74 +/- 0.37 pg/10(6) platelets); PDGF (23 +/- 6 pg/10(6)); PF4 (12 +/- 5 ng/10(6)); TSP-1 (31 +/- 12 ng/10(6)); bFGF (0.44 +/- 0.15 pg/10(6)); and endostatin (5.6 +/- 3.0 pg/10(6)). There was an excellent correlation (R(2) = 0.7) between the platelet levels calculated with the actin ELISA and complete blood count. The levels of the platelets were higher than those in platelet-poor plasma by factors of: VEGF (215-fold); PDGF (914-fold); PF-4 (516-fold); TSP-1 (813-fold); and bFGF (17-fold). The endostatin levels were nearly equivalent. The biovariability of the platelet proteins in eight healthy subjects over a 5-week period was found to be minimal. We describe accurate and direct measurements of the concentrations of VEGF, bFGF, PDGF, TSP-1, endostatin, and PF4 in platelets of healthy human subjects. In contrast to the highly variable levels in plasma and serum, the platelet-derived measurements were accurate and reproducible with minimal biovariability.",M2

20466222,"<e>Platelet</e> aspirin resistance in ED patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.BACKGROUND: Platelet aspirin resistance is reported to be as high as 45%. The prevalence of emergency department (ED) platelet aspirin resistance in suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is not described. Our purpose was to determine the prevalence of platelet aspirin resistance. METHODS: We determined platelet aspirin resistance in a convenience sample of ED suspected ACS patients. Eligible patients had longer than 10 minutes of chest pain or an ischemic equivalent. Two hours after receiving 325 mg of aspirin, blood was assessed for platelet function (Accumetrics, San Diego, CA). Definitions are as follows: aspirin resistance, at least 550 aspirin reaction units; positive troponin T, greater than 0.1 ng/mL; significant coronary lesion, at least 70% stenosis. The composite end point was prospectively defined as a 30-day revisit, positive cardiac catheterization, or hospital length of stay (LOS) longer than 3 days. RESULTS: Of 200 patients, 50.5% were male, 50.0% were black, troponin T was positive in 7.5%, cardiac catheterization was done in 10.5%, and 33.3% had a significant stenosis. Final diagnoses were noncardiac in 83.4%, stable angina in 8.0%, and unstable angina in 8.5%. Overall, 6.5% were resistant to aspirin; and high-risk patients trended to more aspirin resistance than non-high-risk patients (23.1% [3] vs 9.1% [17]; P value 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.0929 to 0.373). One-month follow-up found ED revisits in 12.5% of aspirin-resistant vs 4.9% of non-aspirin-resistant patients (95% CI, -0.114 to 0.182) and rehospitalization in 12.5% of resistant patients vs 4.3% of nonresistant patients (P value 95% CI, -0.108 to 0.187). Although LOS was similar at index admission, if rehospitalized, LOS was 6.5 for aspirin-resistant patients vs 3.2 days in nonresistant patients (P &lt; .0001).

20441566,"Role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase beta in <e>platelet</e> aggregation and thromboxane A2 generation mediated by Gi signalling pathways.PI3Ks (phosphoinositide 3-kinases) play a critical role in platelet functional responses. PI3Ks are activated upon P2Y12 receptor stimulation and generate pro-aggregatory signals. P2Y12 receptor has been shown to play a key role in the platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 generation caused by co-stimulation with Gq or Gz, or super-stimulation of Gi pathways. In the present study, we evaluated the role of specific PI3K isoforms alpha, beta, gamma and delta in platelet aggregation, thromboxane A2 generation and ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) activation. Our results show that loss of the PI3K signal impaired the ability of ADP to induce platelet aggregation, ERK phosphorylation and thromboxane A2 generation. We also show that Gq plus Gi- or Gi plus Gz-mediated platelet aggregation, ERK phosphorylation and thromboxane A2 generation in human platelets was inhibited by TGX-221, a PI3Kbeta-selective inhibitor, but not by PIK75 (a PI3Kalpha inhibitor), AS252424 (a PI3Kgamma inhibitor) or IC87114 (a PI3Kdelta inhibitor). TGX-221 also showed a similar inhibitory effect on the Gi plus Gz-mediated platelet responses in platelets from P2Y1-/- mice. Finally, 2MeSADP (2-methyl-thio-ADP)-induced Akt phosphorylation was significantly inhibited in the presence of TGX-221, suggesting a critical role for PI3Kbeta in Gi-mediated signalling. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PI3Kbeta plays an important role in ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover, PI3Kbeta mediates ADP-induced thromboxane A2 generation by regulating ERK phosphorylation.",M2
20441510,"Preventing <e>platelet</e>-derived microparticle formation--and possible side effects-with prestorage leukofiltration of whole blood.CONTEXT: Platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs) probably function in hemostasis, thrombosis, inflammation, and transfusion-related immunomodulation. OBJECTIVE: To compare PDMP levels of leukocyte-filtered and unfiltered whole blood during storage. DESIGN: Ten whole blood donations were collected and processed. Half of each collection was filtered, half remained unfiltered, and both halves were measured for red cell, white cell, and platelet (PLT) content before storage. Samples were drawn on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 and analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Leukocyte filtration lowered prestorage PDMP and PLT counts by an average of 72% and 99%, respectively. Prestorage PDMP counts were 123 +/- 51/microL in unfiltered whole blood supernatant versus 34 +/- 18/microL after filtration. Prestorage PLT counts were 190 +/- 49/microL in unfiltered whole blood supernatant versus 2 +/- 4/microL after filtration. Moreover, PDMP and PLT counts in filtered whole blood remained low throughout storage, typically below 100/microL. In contrast, unfiltered whole blood PDMP- and PLT-gated events increased approximately 2 log during storage, with the peak number of PLT-gated events tending to coincide with the peak number of PDMP-gated events (4 donors) or to come after the peak number of PDMP-gated events (6 donors). CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte filtration of whole blood lowers prestorage PDMP and PLT counts. Platelet-derived microparticle and PLT counts remain low throughout 35 days of storage. In contrast, PDMP- and PLT-gated events increase significantly in unfiltered whole blood. The nature of PLT-gated events in stored blood warrants further investigation.",M2
20433379,"Evaluation of the effect of phosphodiesterase on equine <e>platelet</e> activation and the effect of antigen challenge on platelet phosphodiesterase activity in horses with recurrent airway obstruction.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether expression of equine platelet activation-dependent surface markers is influenced by phospodiesterase (PDE) isoenzyme activity and whether antigen challenge alters platelet PDE activity in horses with recurrent airway obstruction (RAO). ANIMALS: 16 horses. PROCEDURES: 7 healthy horses were used for in vitro experiments, 6 horses with RAO were used for antigen challenge, and 6 healthy horses were used as control animals. Three of the healthy horses had also been used in the in vitro experiments. Effects of PDE inhibition and activation of adenylyl cyclase on CD41/61 and CD62P expression on platelets and platelet-neutrophil aggregate formation in vitro were investigated via flow cytometry. Platelet PDE activity and sensitivity to inhibition of PDE3 and PDE5 isoenzymes were examined in horses with RAO and control horses before and after antigen challenge. RESULTS: Inhibition of PDE or activation of adenylyl cyclase significantly inhibited stimulus-induced expression of CD41/61 and CD62P (by approx 94% and 40%, respectively) and percentage of CD62P positive cells (by approx 30%). Only the PDE3 inhibitor, trequinsin, caused a significant (53%) reduction in platelet-neutrophil aggregate formation. Platelet PDE activity decreased following antigen challenge in RAO-affected horses and control horses. In horses with RAO, a significant increase in sensitivity of platelet PDE to inhibition by the PDE5 inhibitor zaprinast was observed after 5 hours. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results provided further evidence that PDE3 is an important regulator of equine platelet activation and suggested that changes in regulation of platelet PDE5 may contribute to antigen-induced response in horses with RAO.",M2
20429610,"The <e>platelet</e> actin cytoskeleton associates with SNAREs and participates in alpha-granule secretion.Following platelet activation, platelets undergo a dramatic shape change mediated by the actin cytoskeleton and accompanied by secretion of granule contents. While the actin cytoskeleton is thought to influence platelet granule secretion, the mechanism for this putative regulation is not known. We found that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin A inhibited alpha-granule secretion induced by several different platelet agonists without significantly affecting activation-induced platelet aggregation. In a cell-free secretory system, platelet cytosol was required for alpha-granule secretion. Inhibition of actin polymerization prevented alpha-granule secretion in this system, and purified platelet actin could substitute for platelet cytosol to support alpha-granule secretion. To determine whether SNAREs physically associate with the actin cytoskeleton, we isolated the Triton X-100 insoluble actin cytoskeleton from platelets. VAMP-8 and syntaxin-2 associated only with actin cytoskeletons of activated platelets. Syntaxin-4 and SNAP-23 associated with cytoskeletons isolated from either resting or activated platelets. When syntaxin-4 and SNAP-23 were tested for actin binding in a purified protein system, only syntaxin-4 associated directly with polymerized platelet actin. These data show that the platelet cytoskeleton interacts with select SNAREs and that actin polymerization facilitates alpha-granule release.",M2
20422907,"[The use of <e>platelet</e>-rich fibrin membrane in gingival recession treatment]INTRODUCTION: Fibrin, fibronectin, platelet derived growth factor, and transforming growth factors from platelet concetrate are crucial for tissue reparation and regeneration. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate clinical effectiveness of activated platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) membrane in treatment of gingival recession. METHODS: 19 gingival recessions Miller class I or II were treated with a coronally advanced flap and the PRF membrane (PRF group). Following the elevation of the flap, bone and root surfaces were covered with the PRF membrane. After suturing, the PRF membrane was covered with a coronally advanced flap. In the same patients, 19 other gingival recessions were treated with CTG in combination with the coronally advanced flap (the CTG group). Clinical recordings were made of vertical recession depth (VRD), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and keratinized tissue width (KTW) before and 12 months after mucogingival surgical treatment. Clinical evaluation of healing events was estimated with recordings of the healing index (HI). Recordings of HI were performed in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd week post-surgically. RESULTS: Mean root coverage was significant in both groups (the PRF group 79.94% and the CTG group 88.56% %; p &lt; 0.01). The difference between the two tested groups was not statistically significant. Results of the keratinized tissue width showed significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) 12 months after the surgery in both, the PRF and CTG groups. Results of KTW showed statistical significance of recorded differences obtained in the two evaluated groups (p &lt; 0.05). There was no statistical significance in reduction of PD and CAL recorded in the PRF and CTG groups. The values of HI recorded in the 1st and 2nd week postoperatively were significantly enhanced in the PRF group (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Results of this study confirm both procedures as effective with equivalence of clinical results in solving gingival recession problems. The utilization of the PRF resulted in a decreased postoperative discomfort and advanced tissue healing.",M2
20419155,"Junín virus infection of human hematopoietic progenitors impairs in vitro proplatelet formation and <e>platelet</e> release via a bystander effect involving type I IFN signaling.Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is an endemo-epidemic disease caused by Junín virus (JUNV), a member of the arenaviridae family. Although a recently introduced live attenuated vaccine has proven to be effective, AHF remains a potentially lethal infection. Like in other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF), AHF patients present with fever and hemorrhagic complications. Although the causes of the bleeding are poorly understood, impaired hemostasis, endothelial cell dysfunction and low platelet counts have been described. Thrombocytopenia is a common feature in VHF syndromes, and it is a major sign for its diagnosis. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanism has not yet been elucidated. We hypothesized that thrombocytopenia results from a viral-triggered alteration of the megakaryo/thrombopoiesis process. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of JUNV on megakaryopoiesis using an in vitro model of human CD34+ cells stimulated with thrombopoietin. Our results showed that CD34+ cells are infected with JUNV in a restricted fashion. Infection was transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1)-dependent and the surface expression of TfR1 was higher in infected cultures, suggesting a novel arenaviral dissemination strategy in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Although proliferation, survival, and commitment in JUNV-infected cultures were normal, viral infection impaired thrombopoiesis by decreasing in vitro proplatelet formation, platelet release, and P-selectin externalization via a bystander effect. The decrease in platelet release was also TfR1-dependent, mimicked by poly(I:C), and type I interferon (IFN alpha/beta) was implicated as a key paracrine mediator. Among the relevant molecules studied, only the transcription factor NF-E2 showed a moderate decrease in expression in megakaryocytes from either infected cultures or after type I IFN treatment. Moreover, type I IFN-treated megakaryocytes presented ultrastructural abnormalities resembling the reported thrombocytopenic NF-E2(-/-) mouse phenotype. Our study introduces a potential mechanism for thrombocytopenia in VHF and other diseases associated with increased bone marrow type I IFN levels.",M2

20402171,"<e>Platelet</e> transfusions: the science behind safety, risks and appropriate applications.Platelets are active metabolising cells that are evolved for the tasks of haemostasis, inflammatory reactions and wound healing. When platelet products are stored in the blood bank a complex series of changes occur, leading to partial activation, up-regulation of inflammatory mediators, cellular morphology changes, loss of cell membrane lipids and micro-particle formation, as well as apoptosis. The resultant coagulation transfusion product has a number of potential expected side effects including fever, alloimmunisation, sepsis, thrombosis and transfusion-related acute lung injury. Of course, these events are occasional side effects yet they are some of the most common potential disasters of transfusion. Platelet transfusions in patients bleeding from thrombocytopaenia or severe platelet suppression will most likely benefit from a platelet transfusion. However, outcome data (controversial) have shown in some populations that platelet transfusions are associated with worse patient outcomes. Such associations may be due to the biologic changes that have occurred during storage, lack of HLA matching as well as other causes or it could be a mismatch of the platelet products to patient's needs (over-use). Platelets are administered in the surgical arena often due to 'clinical judgement', which errs on the side of, perhaps, too frequent use.",M2

20400886,"Increased mean <e>platelet</e> volume and C-reactive protein levels in patients with chronic urticaria with a positive autologous serum skin test.INTRODUCTION: Activation of the coagulation cascade resulting in thrombin production is a prominent feature of exacerbations in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CU). Autologous serum skin test (ASST) causes wheal-and-flare reactions in 30% to 50% of CU cases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory data in patients with CU with positive and negative ASST. To understand the role of platelets in CU, we investigated the relation between CU clinical severity, platelet count and their mean platelet volume (MPV). METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data were prospectively collected from 373 patients with CU who attended our Allergy and Clinical immunology Clinic during the period 2003 to 2007. The laboratory data were compared with 46 healthy subjects. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in platelet counts between the groups, nevertheless the platelets in ASST-positive CU patients were characterized by a higher MPV (9.12 +/- 1.25 fl), than that in ASST-negative patients (7.95 +/- 1.08 fl; P = 0.039) and control group (7.72 +/- 1.04 fl; P = 0.007). There was a significant positive correlation between CU severity score and MPV in ASST-positive patients (r = 0.44; P &lt; 0.001) but not in ASST-negative patients. Higher levels of C-reactive protein (5.31 +/- 2.74 mg/L) were measured in the ASST-positive CU group compared with the ASST-negative CU group (2.53 +/- 1.27; P = 0.029) and the control group (2.34 +/- 1.38; P = 0.003).

20400514,"Cbl-b is a novel physiologic regulator of glycoprotein VI-dependent <e>platelet</e> activation.Cbl-b, a member of the Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, plays an important role in the activation of lymphocytes. However, its function in platelets remains unknown. We show that Cbl-b is expressed in human platelets along with c-Cbl, but in contrast to c-Cbl, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated upon glycoprotein VI (GPVI) stimulation. Cbl-b, unlike c-Cbl, is not required for Syk ubiquitylation downstream of GPVI activation. Phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) are constituently associated with Cbl-b. Cbl-b-deficient (Cbl-b(-/-)) platelets display an inhibition in the concentration-response curve for GPVI-specific agonist-induced aggregation, secretion, and Ca(2+) mobilization. A parallel inhibition is found for activation of PLCgamma2 and BTK. However, Syk activation is not affected by the absence of Cbl-b, indicating that Cbl-b acts downstream of Syk but upstream of BTK and PLCgamma2. When Cbl-b(-/-) mice were tested in the ferric chloride thrombosis model, occlusion time was increased and clot stability was reduced compared with wild type controls. These data indicate that Cbl-b plays a positive modulatory role in GPVI-dependent platelet signaling, which translates to an important regulatory role in hemostasis and thrombosis in vivo.",M2

However, genetic background can significantly influence the response to radiation and hence also the overall health of crewmembers. The major goal of this study was to compare leukocyte population responses in two strains of mice that differ in susceptibility to radiation: C57BL/6 (resistant) and CBA/Ca (susceptible). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mice were whole-body irradiated with 0, 50, 200, or 300 cGy (56)Fe(26) (1 GeV) at approximately 1 Gy/min and euthanised on days 4 and 30 thereafter for analyses. Analyses included body and organ masses (spleen, liver, thymus, lungs), distribution of leukocyte populations in blood and spleen, red blood cell and <e>platelet</e> characteristics, expression of surface molecules (CD11b, CD54), and spontaneous and mitogen-induced blastogenesis. RESULTS: There were main effects of Dose and Dose x Day interactions on virtually all quantified parameters in both strains of mice.

We have expanded this observation to investigate if coated platelet levels correlate with bleed volume in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. METHODS: Coated platelet levels and bleed volume were determined in 45 patients with a diagnosis of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. RESULTS: There was an inverse relationship between coated platelet levels and bleed volume (r=-0.38, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These data support a link between decreased coated platelet synthesis and the severity of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.",M2

During this process, repeated rounds of DNA synthesis are characterized by lack of late anaphase and cytokinesis. Physiologically, the majority of the polyploid megakaryocytes in the bone marrow are cell cycle arrested. As previously reported, cyclin E is essential for megakaryocyte polyploidy; however, it has remained unclear whether up-regulated cyclin E is an inducer of polyploidy in vivo. We found that cyclin E is up-regulated upon stimulation of primary megakaryocytes by thrombopoietin. Transgenic mice in which elevated cyclin E expression is targeted to megakaryocytes display an increased ploidy profile. Examination of S phase markers, specifically proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin A, and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine reveals that cyclin E promotes progression to S phase and cell cycling. Interestingly, analysis of Cdc6 and Mcm2 indicates that cyclin E mediates its effect by promoting the expression of components of the pre-replication complex. Furthermore, we show that up-regulated cyclin E results in the up-regulation of cyclin B1 levels, suggesting an additional mechanism of cyclin E-mediated ploidy increase. These findings define a key role for cyclin E in promoting megakaryocyte entry into S phase and hence, increase in the number of cell cycling cells and in augmenting polyploidization.",M2

20383304,"Blood components for topical use in tissue regeneration: evaluation of corneal lesions treated with <e>platelet</e> lysate and considerations on repair mechanisms.BACKGROUND: The fields of application of topically administered platelet derivatives are numerous and increasing. The use of this blood component is based on the fact that it contains growth factors and proteins of the clotting system. Studies carried out so far have been aimed at identifying these substances, assaying their content in the various types of platelet concentrate used, determining the in vivo and in vitro mechanisms of action, and trying to standardise the production methods. However, much still remains to be discovered, not only about the growth factors, but also about all those cytokines and biochemical mediators that are involved in the processes of tissue regeneration. METHODS: We studied the use of platelet lysate, obtained from platelet-rich plasma which had been frozen, for the treatment of corneal ulcers caused by neurotrophic keratitis and of epithelial and stromal loss following physical or chemical trauma. The platelet lysate was administered in the form of eye drops to patients who had not responded to conventional therapy and who were at risk of corneal scarring. RESULTS: The results were satisfactory in terms of both tissue regeneration and healing time. The clinical follow-up showed a clear reduction in the time of regeneration of the damaged epithelium and stabilisation of the repair process. The epithelial defects disappeared completely in all the treated eyes within 6 to 32 days, with the time depending on the type of lesion and the severity of the damage. CONCLUSIONS: The cornea reacts to damage by releasing numerous substances, including cytokines, growth factors, proteases and neuropeptides in order to restore its anatomical integrity. A change in the balance between inhibitory and stimulating substances can lead to the development of complications. Fast, correct re-epithelialisation is fundamental for the formation of new, transparent tissue.

Human CD34(+) cells express JAM-A, as defined by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. JAM-A mediates differentiation of CD34(+) cells to endothelial progenitor cells and facilitates CD34(+) cell-induced reendothelialization in vitro. Pretreatment of human CD34(+) cells with sJAM-A-Fc resulted in increased neointima formation 3 weeks after endothelial denudation in the carotid arteries of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the expression of JAM-A on CD34(+) cells mediates adhesion to the vascular wall after injury and differentiation into endothelial progenitor cells, a mechanism potentially involved in vascular regeneration. Human CD34(+) cells express JAM-A, mediating their interaction with platelets and endothelial cells. Specifically, JAM-A expressed on human CD34(+) progenitor cells regulates their adhesion over immobilized platelets or inflammatory endothelium under high shear stress in vitro and after carotid ligation in vivo or ischemia/reperfusion injury in the microcirculation of mice. Moreover, it mediates differentiation of CD34(+) cells to endothelial progenitor cells and facilitates reendothelialization.",M2
20377806,"Effect of obesity on <e>platelet</e> reactivity and response to low-dose aspirin.Insufficient platelet function suppression by aspirin is a predictor of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. The authors assessed the impact of obesity on platelet responsiveness before and after 2 weeks of aspirin 81 mg/d in 2014 people. Obese individuals had greater baseline platelet reactivity. Comparing obese and nonobese individuals after aspirin therapy, results for aggregometry to collagen were 6.7 vs 6.1 ohms, P=.008; aggregometry to adenosine diphosphate were 13.1 vs 11.8 ohms,P&lt;.0001; aggregometry to arachidonic acid (AA) were 4.9% vs 8.3% nonzero aggregation, P=.002; urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (Tx-M) were 4.9% vs 8.3% nonzero aggregation, P=.002; and aspirin resistance were 26.% vs 20.5%, P=.002; respectively. These remained significantly different for AA aggregation and Tx-M excretion after adjustment for covariates. Obese individuals have greater native platelet reactivity and retain greater reactivity after suppression by aspirin.",M2
20374483,"Microvascular responses to cardiovascular risk factors.Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and obesity are among a growing list of conditions that have been designated as major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). While CVD risk factors are well known to enhance the development of atherosclerotic lesions in large arteries, there is also evidence that the structure and function of microscopic blood vessels can be profoundly altered by these conditions. The diverse responses of the microvasculature to CVD risk factors include oxidative stress, enhanced leukocyte- and <e>platelet</e>-endothelial cell adhesion, impaired endothelial barrier function, altered capillary proliferation, enhanced thrombosis, and vasomotor dysfunction. Emerging evidence indicates that a low-grade systemic inflammatory response that results from risk factor-induced cell activation and cell-cell interactions may underlie the phenotypic changes induced by risk factor exposure. A consequence of the altered microvascular phenotype and systemic inflammatory response is an enhanced vulnerability of tissues to the deleterious effects of secondary oxidative and inflammatory stresses, such as ischemia and reperfusion. Future efforts to develop therapies that prevent the harmful effects of risk factor-induced inflammation should focus on the microcirculation.",M2
20371742,"Mutation-specific hemostatic variability in mice expressing common type 2B von Willebrand disease substitutions.Type 2B von Willebrand disease (2B VWD) results from von Willebrand factor (VWF) A1 mutations that enhance VWF-GPIbalpha binding. These  gain of function  mutations lead to an increased affinity of the mutant VWF for <e>platelets</e> and the binding of mutant high-molecular-weight VWF multimers to platelets in vivo, resulting in an increase in clearance of both platelets and VWF. Three common 2B VWD mutations (R1306W, V1316M, and R1341Q) were independently introduced into the mouse Vwf cDNA sequence and the expression vectors delivered to 8- to 10-week-old C57Bl6 VWF(-/-) mice, using hydrodynamic injection. The resultant phenotype was examined, and a ferric chloride-induced injury model was used to examine the thrombogenic effect of the 2B VWD variants in mice. Reconstitution of only the plasma component of VWF resulted in the generation of the 2B VWD phenotype in mice. Variable thrombocytopenia was observed in mice expressing 2B VWF, mimicking the severity seen in 2B VWD patients: mice expressing the V1316M mutation showed the most severe thrombocytopenia. Ferric chloride-induced injury to cremaster arterioles showed a marked reduction in thrombus development and platelet adhesion in the presence of circulating 2B VWF. These defects were only partially rescued by normal platelet transfusions, thus emphasizing the key role of the abnormal plasma VWF environment in 2B VWD.",M2
20368775,"Proteomics strategy for identifying candidate bioactive proteins in complex mixtures: application to the <e>platelet</e> releasate.Proteomic approaches have proven powerful at identifying large numbers of proteins, but there are fewer reports of functional characterization of proteins in biological tissues. Here, we describe an experimental approach that fractionates proteins released from human platelets, linking bioassay activity to identity. We used consecutive orthogonal separation platforms to ensure sensitive detection: (a) ion-exchange of intact proteins, (b) SDS-PAGE separation of ion-exchange fractions and (c) HPLC separation of tryptic digests coupled to electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Migration of THP-1 monocytes in response to complete or fractionated platelet releasate was assessed and located to just one of the forty-nine ion-exchange fractions. Over 300 proteins were identified in the releasate, with a wide range of annotated biophysical and biochemical properties, in particular platelet activation, adhesion, and wound healing. The presence of PEDF and involucrin, two proteins not previously reported in platelet releasate, was confirmed by western blotting. Proteins identified within the fraction with monocyte promigratory activity and not in other inactive fractions included vimentin, PEDF, and TIMP-1. We conclude that this analytical platform is effective for the characterization of complex bioactive samples.",M2
20361492,"[<e>Platelet</e> abnormalities in type 2 diabetes mellitus]Diabetes mellitus is a problem of health worldwide being vascular complications the main causes of morbidity and mortality in this population. Diabetics have a fast atherothrombotic evolution which is worse than that observed for other clinical entities; however, hyperglycemia itself may not totally explain the ischemic complications observed in these patients. Most ischemic arterial events are precipitated by plaque rupture, platelet activation, and thrombosis. Several abnormalities in the blood coagulation system have been described associated to diabetes mellitus, all of them predisposing to thrombosis: endothelial cell dysfunction, platelet hyperreactivity, thrombin generation and hypofibrinolysis. Platelets play a key role in diabetic atherothrombosis due to platelet hypersensitivity to physiological agonists, low response to therapeutical antiplatelet agents, platelet hyperreactivity in sites of endothelial cell damage, hyperaggregability, resistance to the inhibitory effects of the insulin, and low endothelial production of prostacyclin and nitric oxide. All these phenomena have been associated to either a toxic microenvironment due to hyperglycemia or to intrinsic platelet abnormalities. Based on all these facts, it is proposed that platelets may be another target for the negative effects of insulin-resistance state. Because platelets are crucial in the atherosclerotic process and in the genesis of the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus, this review analyses the platelet abnormalities observed in this metabolic disease.",M2
20361303,"The protective effects of paclitaxel on <e>platelet</e> aggregation through the inhibition of thromboxane A2 synthase.Paclitaxel is an anticancer drug used in the treatment of ovarian, breast, head and neck, lung, and prostate cancer. We investigated the antiplatelet activity of paclitaxel in vitro as well as a possible antiplatelet mechanism. Paclitaxel inhibited washed rabbit platelet aggregation induced by collagen in a concentration dependent manner, with an IC(50) of 59.7 +/- 3.5. However, it had little effect on platelet aggregation mediated by arachidonic acid, U46619, a thromboxane (TX) A(2) mimic, or thrombin, suggesting that paclitaxel may strongly inhibit collagen mediated signal transduction. In accordance with these findings, paclitaxel blocked collagen induced cytosolic calcium mobilization, arachidonic acid liberation, and serotonin secretion. In addition, it inhibited arachidonic acid mediated platelet aggregation by about 37% by interfering with TXA(2) synthase as measured by the formation of arachidonic acid mediated TXA(2) and prostaglandin D(2), as well as cyclooxygenase-1 and TXA(2) synthase activity assays. Taken together, these results point to a cellular mechanism for the antiplatelet activity of paclitaxel through the inhibition of TXA(2) synthase and cytosolic calcium mobilization. This may contribute to the beneficial effects of paclitaxel on the cardiovascular system.",M2
20360535,"Glucose-regulated protein 78 and <e>platelet</e> deposition: effect of rosuvastatin.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of rosuvastatin on platelet deposition under controlled shear rate conditions and to identify new platelet proteins involved in the interaction with the activating substrate. METHODS AND RESULTS: Platelet-vessel wall interaction and thrombosis take place under dynamic conditions involving the interaction of the exposed damaged vascular wall with the circulating blood cells and proteins. Blood was perfused over type I collagen at different wall shear rates, and platelet deposition was measured by confocal microscopy. Perfused effluent blood was collected, platelets were sequentially extracted based on differential protein solubility, and proteins were separated by 2D gel electrophoresis. Blockade of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase significantly reduced platelet deposition and modulated the expression pattern of 18 proteins in the platelet subproteome. Among them, an increase in platelet surface 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), a stress-inducible multifunctional endoplasmic reticulum protein, was clearly apparent. Immunoprecipitation of platelet GRP78 revealed its interaction with tissue factor. Moreover, blockade of surface GRP78 resulted in a substantial increase in platelet deposition and tissue factor procoagulant activity and in a decrease in clotting time. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that blockade of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase reduces platelet deposition and inhibits GRP78 translocation from the platelet surface after shear and collagen activation. For the first time to our knowledge, this study reports on the presence and functional role of GRP78 in platelets and indicates that GRP78 has additional functions beyond those of a molecular chaperone.",M2
20358105,"<e>Platelet</e> retraction force measurements using flexible post force sensors.Platelets play an important role in hemostasis by forming a thrombotic plug that seals the vessel wall and promotes vascular healing. After platelets adhere and aggregate at the wound site, their next step is to generate contractile forces through the coordination of physicochemical interactions between actin, myosin, and alpha(IIb)beta(3) integrin receptors that retract the thrombus' size and strengthen its adhesion to the exposed matrix. Although platelet contractile forces (PCF) are a definitive feature of hemostasis and thrombosis, there are few approaches that can directly measure them. In this study, we describe the development of an approach to measure PCF in microthrombi using a microscopic flexible post force sensor array. Quasi-static measurements and live microscopic imaging of thrombin-activated platelets on the posts were conducted to assay the development of PCF to various hemostatic conditions. Microthrombi were observed to produce forces that monotonically increased with thrombin concentration and activation time, but forces subsided when thrombin was removed. PCF results were statistically similar on arrays of posts printed with fibronectin or fibrinogen. PCF measurements were combined with clot volume measurements to determine that the average force per platelet was 2.1 +/- 0.1 nN after 60 min, which is significantly higher than what has been measured with previous approaches. Overall, the flexible post arrays for PCF measurements are a promising approach for evaluating platelet functionality, platelet physiology and pathology, the impacts of different matrices or agonists on hemostatic responses, and in providing critical information regarding platelet activity that can guide new hemostatic or thrombotic strategies.",M2
20356841,"Thrombin and collagen induce a feedback inhibitory signaling pathway in <e>platelets</e> involving dissociation of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A from an NFkappaB-IkappaB complex.Protein kinase A (PKA) activation by cAMP phosphorylates multiple target proteins in numerous platelet inhibitory pathways that have a very important role in maintaining circulating platelets in a resting state. Here we show that in thrombin- and collagen-stimulated platelets, PKA is activated by cAMP-independent mechanisms involving dissociation of the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) from an NFkappaB-IkappaBalpha-PKAc complex. We demonstrate mRNA and protein expression for most of the NFkappaB family members in platelets. From resting platelets, PKAc was co-immunoprecipitated with IkappaBalpha, and conversely, IkappaBalpha was also co-immunoprecipitated with PKAc. This interaction was significantly reduced in thrombin- and collagen-stimulated platelets. Stimulation of platelets with thrombin- or collagen-activated IKK, at least partly by PI3 kinase-dependent pathways, leading to phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, disruption of an IkappaBalpha-PKAc complex, and release of free, active PKAc, which phosphorylated VASP and other PKA substrates. IKK inhibitor inhibited thrombin-stimulated IkBalpha phosphorylation, PKA-IkBalpha dissociation, and VASP phosphorylation, and potentiated integrin alphaIIbbeta3 activation and the early phase of platelet aggregation. We conclude that thrombin and collagen not only cause platelet activation but also appear to fine-tune this response by initiating downstream NFkappaB-dependent PKAc activation, as a novel feedback inhibitory signaling mechanism for preventing undesired platelet activation.",M2

To observe the effect of sodium ozagrel to prevent and treat thrombosis in patients with ET. METHODS: The subjects including 48 patients with ET. All patients were measured the plasma TXB2, 6-keto-PGF1alpha, CD62P and PAC-1 before and after treatment with or without sodium ozagrel. RESULTS: The plasma levels of CD62P, PAC-1, TXB2, 6-keto-PGF1alpha and TXA2/PGI2 in the patients with ET were significantly higher than the normal people (P &lt; 0.01). The levels of CD62P, PAC-1, TXB2, TXB2/6-keto-PGF1alpha in patients with treatment of sodium ozagrel were higher than patients without treatment of sodium ozagrel (P &lt; 0.01). The plasma levels of CD62P, PAC-1 and TXA2/PGI2 in patients with treatment of sodium ozagrel and that in normal people had no significant distinction (P &lt; 0.01). All the index of conventional therapy group were higher than normal people (P &lt; 0.01) but had no significant distinction with the patients before conventional treating. The incidence of thrombus in patients treated with sodium ozagrel was lower than patients treated without sodium ozagrel (P &lt; 0.05).

20351310,"Synergism between <e>platelet</e> collagen receptors defined using receptor-specific collagen-mimetic peptide substrata in flowing blood.Exposed subendothelial collagen acts as a substrate for platelet adhesion and thrombus formation after vascular injury. Synthetic collagen-derived triple-helical peptides, designated collagen-related peptide (CRP), GFOGER, and VWF-III, can specifically engage the platelet collagen receptors, glycoprotein VI and integrin alpha(2)beta(1), and plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF), respectively. Hitherto, the role of these 3 collagen-binding axes has been studied indirectly. Use of these uniform peptide substrates, rather than collagen fibers, provides independent control of each axis. Here, we use confocal imaging and novel image analysis techniques to investigate the effects of receptor-ligand engagement on platelet binding and activation during thrombus formation under flow conditions. At low shear (100s(-1) and 300s(-1)), both GFOGER and CRP are required for thrombus formation. At 1000s(-1), a combination of either CRP or GFOGER with VWF-III induces comparable thrombus formation, and VWF-III increases thrombus deposition at all shear rates, being indispensable at 3000s(-1). A combination of CRP and VWF-III is sufficient to support extensive platelet deposition at 3000s(-1), with slight additional effect of GFOGER. Measurement of thrombus height after specific receptor blockade or use of altered proportions of peptides indicates a signaling rather than adhesive role for glycoprotein VI, and primarily adhesive roles for both alpha(2)beta(1) and the VWF axis.",M2

20335550,"Omega-3 fatty acid supplements in women at high risk of breast cancer have dose-dependent effects on breast adipose tissue fatty acid composition.BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence of the preventive benefits of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in breast cancer continues to fuel interest in the potential role of dietary fat content in reducing breast cancer risk. The dose of fish-oil/omega-3 PUFAs needed to achieve maximal target tissue effects for breast cancer prevention remains undefined. OBJECTIVE: To determine the dose effects of omega-3 fatty acids on breast adipose tissue fatty acid profiles, we conducted a study of 4 doses of omega-3 PUFAs in women at high risk of breast cancer. DESIGN: In this 6-mo randomized open-label study, 48 women with increased breast cancer risk received 1, 3, 6, or 9 capsules/d of an omega-3 PUFA supplement that provided 0.84, 2.52, 5.04, and 7.56 g docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) + eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) daily, respectively. Subjects made monthly visits, at which time pill counts were made and fasting blood samples were collected to determine fatty acid profiles; anthropometric measurements were made, breast adipose tissue samples were collected, and laboratory tests of toxicity (alanine aminotransferase, LDL cholesterol, and <e>platelet</e> function) were made at baseline and at 3 and 6 mo. RESULTS: All doses led to increased serum and breast adipose tissue EPA and DHA concentrations, but the response to 0.84 g DHA+EPA/d was less than the maximum possible response with &gt; or = 2.52 g/d. Body mass index attenuated the dose response for serum tissue DHA and EPA (P = 0.015 and 0.027, respectively) and breast adipose tissue DHA (P = 0.0022) in all of the treatment groups. The incremental increase in DHA and EPA correlated inversely with baseline fat and serum values. Compliance over 6 mo was 92.9 +/- 9.2% and was unaffected by treatment arm. No severe or serious toxicities were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Daily doses up to 7.56 g DHA+EPA were well tolerated with excellent compliance in this cohort at high risk of breast cancer. Body mass index and baseline fatty acid concentrations modulated the dose-response effects of omega-3 PUFA supplements on serum EPA and DHA and breast adipose tissue DHA.",M2

The relative reduction of large plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers and the absent VWF triplet structure was consistent with type 2A (phenotype IIC) VWD. Surprisingly, <e>platelet</e> VWF was completely deficient of multimers beyond the VWF protomer, suggesting defective alpha-granular storage of larger multimers. Patients were nearly unresponsive to desmopressin acetate, consistent with a lack of regulated VWF release from endothelial cell Weibel-Palade bodies, suggesting defective storage also in endothelial cells. We identified an N528S homozygous mutation in the VWF propeptide D2 domain, predicting the introduction of an additional N-glycosylation site at amino acid 526 in close vicinity to a  CGLC  disulphide isomerase consensus sequence. Expression studies in mammalian cells demonstrated that N528S-VWF was neither normally multimerized nor trafficked to storage granules. However, propeptide containing the N528S mutation trafficked normally to storage granules. Our data indicate that the patients' phenotype is the result of defective multimerization, storage, and secretion. In addition, we have identified a potentially novel pathogenic mechanism of VWD, namely a transportation and storage defect of mature VWF due to defective interaction with its transporter, the mutant propeptide.",M2
20332671,"<e>Platelet</e> hyporesponsiveness to acetylsalicylic acid can be transferred by plasma in humans.In the present study, we investigated prospectively whether an existing platelet hyporesponsiveness to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) can be transferred to platelets with a previously normal reactivity to ASA. Therefore, 80 patients who had undergone coronary bypass surgery were selected, and the efficacy of their oral aspirin therapy was tested. Platelet aggregation was measured by means of light transmission aggregometry (LTA) after stimulation by 1 mmol/l arachidonic acid (ARA) as well as by 1 mmol/l ARA + in vitro addition of 25 micromol/l ASA. The threshold for a sufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation was set to &lt; or = 30% aggregation after ARA stimulation. A group of healthy volunteers with normal, almost complete inhibition of ARA-induced aggregation after in vitro addition of ASA served as control (group A). On the basis of the LTA measurement, 20 patients exhibited a hyporesponsiveness to oral and in vitro ASA (group B). Despite oral ASA treatment, in these patients ARA stimulation still induced aggregation, which could not be inhibited by in vitro addition of ASA. If group B plasma (from these hyporesponsive patients) was added to group A platelets (with normal reaction to ASA), this resulted in a conversion to hyporesponsive platelets, which then showed full aggregation in response to ARA (81%), and which could no longer be inhibited by in vitro ASA addition. In contrast, the normal ASA-responsive patients (group C) exhibited a nearly complete inhibition of ARA-induced aggregation by ASA. If group C plasma was incubated with group A platelets, ARA-induced aggregation could nearly completely be inhibited by in vitro addition of aspirin (ARA aggregation before ASA: 79%; after ASA addition: 7%). In conclusion, it can be stated that platelet hyporesponsiveness to ASA seems to be mediated by a transferable plasma factor.",M2
20329583,"[The endocannabinoid system and interference with thrombogenesis]The endocannabinoid system is an endogenous signaling system that plays a role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and lipid and glucose metabolism-all of which can influence cardiometabolic risk. The endocannabinoid system is normally a silent physiologic system that becomes transiently activated, that is, only when needed. Endocannabinoids may also be secreted by the endothelium. Accordingly, there has been interest in the interactions between endocannabinoids and blood cells. There is certainly evidence that endocannabinoids, especially 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), may promote <e>platelet</e> activation, indicating that they may participace in regulation of thrombosis and inflammation. Platelets are involved both in the metabolism and release of endocannabinoids, and so it is possible that their circulating levels may be regulated by platelets. 2-AG can be considered a new physiologic platelet agonist able to induce full platelet activation and aggregation with a non-CB1/CB2 receptor-mediated mechanism. Not only may endocannabinoids regulate platelet function and possibly lead to thrombogenesis, but they may also influence haematopoesis.",M2
20308114,"Atomic layer deposition-based functionalization of materials for medical and environmental health applications.Nanoporous alumina membranes exhibit high pore densities, well-controlled and uniform pore sizes, as well as straight pores. Owing to these unusual properties, nanoporous alumina membranes are currently being considered for use in implantable sensor membranes and water purification membranes. Atomic layer deposition is a thin-film growth process that may be used to modify the pore size in a nanoporous alumina membrane while retaining a narrow pore distribution. In addition, films deposited by means of atomic layer deposition may impart improved biological functionality to nanoporous alumina membranes. In this study, zinc oxide coatings and platinum coatings were deposited on nanoporous alumina membranes by means of atomic layer deposition. PEGylated nanoporous alumina membranes were prepared by self-assembly of 1-mercaptoundec-11-yl hexa(ethylene glycol) on platinum-coated nanoporous alumina membranes. The pores of the PEGylated nanoporous alumina membranes remained free of fouling after exposure to human <e>platelet</e>-rich plasma; protein adsorption, fibrin networks and platelet aggregation were not observed on the coated membrane surface. Zinc oxide-coated nanoporous alumina membranes demonstrated activity against two waterborne pathogens, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

20307225,"Thrombin receptor antagonism -the potential of antiplatelet medication SCH 530348.IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. <e>Platelet</e> activation and subsequent thrombus formation play a central role in disease progression and development of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Despite widespread use of single and dual antiplatelet therapies in atherothrombotic disease, ischemic complications remain common. Therefore, the need exists for new antiplatelet agents that are more effective, but with acceptable safety profiles (i.e., do not increase risk of bleeding). Antiplatelet agents available at present are effective in blocking the cyclo-oxygenase, ADP-mediated and final common (IIb/IIIa receptor) pathways for platelet activation. Recently, there has been more interest in inhibition of the proteinase-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), which blocks thrombin-mediated platelet activation. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review covers the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and development of the new PAR(1) antagonist, SCH 530348 in a review of all publications relevant to the topic over the last 10 years. Phase II clinical trials indicate that addition of this agent to current antiplatelet regimens may provide additional antithrombotic protection without an increase in bleeding. Results of the ongoing Phase III trials, examining the use of SCH 530348 in patients with ACS and for secondary prevention of ischemic events are anxiously awaited. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The review is a summary of all pharmacologic properties and current clinical data available on the PAR1 antagonist SCH 530348. The readers will be introduced to its novel mechanism of action, advantages over current antiplatelet agents and potential future applications should ongoing clinical trials confirm its efficacy in reducing platelet activity. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: SCH 530348 is a new, orally administered antiplatelet agent that blocks the protease-activated thrombin receptor on the platelet. Early clinical data indicate that it is associated with a lower risk of bleeding. However, its efficacy in improving clinical outcomes in patients with coronary disease remains to be confirmed in ongoing Phase III clinical trials.",M2
20306432,"Development of a novel large animal model of ischemic heart failure using autologous <e>platelet</e> aggregates.BACKGROUND: Current animal models of heart failure lack the biomass of thrombus that occurs in patients undergoing myocardial infarction. We propose a novel animal model of ischemic cardiomyopathy developed by sequential direct injections of autologous platelet aggregates into the coronary circulation resulting in development of ischemic cardiac insufficiency. METHODS: Autologous platelets from adult sheep were isolated and aggregated. Aggregated platelets were then injected into the coronary circulation of anesthetized animals under fluoroscopic guidance. Troponin I levels were monitored for first three days after embolization to validate cardiac tissue injury. Progression of heart failure was corroborated by monitoring changes in echo-based assessment of ejection fraction and left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions. Thrombus-based obstruction of coronary artery was confirmed with histopathology review by mepacrine labeling of pre-aggregated platelets. RESULTS: All experimental animals developed heart failure-like cardiac insufficiency confirmed by elevated levels of troponin I and associated with significant drop in the ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential injections of aggregated platelets into coronary circulation lead to progressive development of ischemic cardiac insufficiency. This phenomenon seems to mimic development of ischemic heart failure seen in human patients and opens multiple research opportunities to fill the existing gap between basic research and clinical practice.",M2
20298992,"Point-of-care assessment of <e>platelet</e> reactivity after clopidogrel to predict myonecrosis in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the influence of platelet reactivity after clopidogrel, as assessed by the VerifyNow point-of-care assay (Accumetrics, San Diego, California), on myonecrosis in low-to-intermediate risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Inadequate platelet inhibition at the time of PCI is associated with a higher risk of recurrent ischemic events. METHODS: A total of 250 consecutive biomarker-negative patients treated with clopidogrel and undergoing elective PCI were enrolled. Cardiac biomarkers (creatine kinase-myocardial band and troponin I) were measured before and 8 and 24 h after intervention. Platelet reactivity after clopidogrel was assessed immediately before PCI by the VerifyNow P2Y12 point-of-care assay. High platelet reactivity (HPR) after clopidogrel was defined as a platelet reaction unit value &gt; or =240. RESULTS: Patients with HPR (31% of the overall population) showed more frequent myonecrosis, with statistical significance with regard to creatine kinase-myocardial band elevation (35% vs. 20%; p = 0.011), and by trend with regard to troponin-I elevation (47% vs. 35%; p = 0.059). Incidence of periprocedural myocardial infarction was higher in patients with HPR, both by creatine kinase-myocardial band (13% vs. 4%; p = 0.011) and troponin-I definition (32% vs. 19%; p = 0.019). By multivariable analysis, HPR was an independent predictor of periprocedural myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Easily assessed by a point-of-care assay, HPR after clopidogrel is a frequent finding and is associated with increased risk of myonecrosis in low-to-intermediate risk patients undergoing planned PCI.",M2
20298742,"A novel fluorescent-based assay reveals that thrombopoietin signaling and Bcl-X(L) influence, respectively, <e>platelet</e> and erythrocyte lifespans.OBJECTIVE: The factors determining platelet and erythrocyte lifespan are not completely understood, despite extensive study. The lack of success may be attributed to the methods used to measure lifespan kinetics, all of which require processing of cells prior to analysis, and the inconsistent and potentially inappropriate use of mathematical models for data analysis. The aims of this study were to establish an in vivo platelet and erythrocyte labeling method using carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), determine the most appropriate mathematical model for lifespan analysis, and apply both to the study of factors that control platelet and erythrocyte lifespans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Control, c-mpl knockout (KO), and Bcl-X(L) mutant mice were injected with CFSE and platelet and erythrocyte fluorescence followed over time. Datasets were analyzed using linear, exponential, multiple-hit, and lognormal mathematical models. RESULTS: In vivo CFSE labeling of platelets and erythrocytes requires no postcollection processing, proved stable, nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, and the lifespans were highly reproducible. Mathematical modeling revealed the lognormal model gave a robust fit to control and extreme datasets when either extrinsic or intrinsic factors determined lifespan. Using these methods, platelet lifespans were found to be significantly shortened in thrombopoietin-receptor-deficient mice independent of blood loss, and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-X(L) was shown to play a role in prolonging erythrocyte lifespans. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous study of platelet and erythrocyte lifespans using in vivo CFSE labeling with lognormal modeling yielded insight into common intrinsic and extrinsic platelet and erythrocyte lifespan determinants and provides an improved methodology for use in this field of research.",M2
20237147,"Effect of osmotic shock and urea on phosphatidylserine scrambling in thrombocyte cell membranes.Blood passing the renal medulla enters a strongly hypertonic environment challenging functional properties and survival of blood cells.

FACS analysis was employed to estimate cytosolic Ca(2+) activity with Fluo3 fluorescence, ceramide formation, P-selectin, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa activation with fluorescent antibodies and phosphatidylserine exposure with annexin V-binding. The spontaneous platelet aggregation was measured by impedance aggregometry. Hyperosmotic shock (addition of 500 mM sucrose or 250 mM NaCl) significantly enhanced cytosolic Ca(2+) activity, ceramide formation, phosphatidylserine exposure, platelet degranulation, and aggregability. Addition of 500 mM urea to isotonic saline did not significantly modify cytosolic Ca(2+) activity, ceramide abundance, or annexin V-binding but significantly blunted the respective effects of hypertonic shock following addition of 500 mM sucrose. In isotonic solutions, both ceramide (20 microM) and Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin (0.5 microM) increased annexin V-binding, effects again significantly blunted by 500 mM urea. Moreover, oxidative stress by addition of 0.5 mM peroxynitrite increased cytosolic Ca(2+) activity and triggered annexin V-binding, effects again blunted in the presence of 500 mM urea. The observations reveal that hyperosmotic shock and oxidative stress trigger a procoagulant platelet phenotype, an effect blunted by the presence of high urea concentrations.",M2
20235104,"Isolation of <e>platelet</e> granules.Functional analysis of platelet intracellular structures requires isolation and purification of these cellular compartments. With regard to the function of platelets, both, dense (delta) and alpha granules are relevant target structures. However, the availability of sufficient purification protocols for these structures is rather limited. This unit describes two protocols for isolation and purification of platelet granule structures. The Basic Protocol describes a new technique based on immunolabeling with target-specific antibodies followed by magnetic sorting, whereas the Alternate Protocol describes the more traditional procedure based on differential centrifugation and density-based sedimentation. For both methods, the degree of granule purification can be most easily determined by immunoblotting using various antibodies that recognize structure-specific proteins. The immunomagnetic sorting method is especially good for studies requiring highly purified material (e.g., for the identification of specific transporters and receptors).",M2
20231609,"Use of the RQI test for bacterial screening of whole blood <e>platelets</e>.We compare our experience using a new rapid qualitative immunoassay (RQI) test (platelet Pan Genera Detection, Verax, Worcester, MA) for bacterial screening of whole blood platelet (WBP) pools with our previous WBP bacterial screen, pH testing. All WBP pools were RQI tested at the time of issue. All RQI+ pools were cultured in an automated culture system, with subsequent bacterial identification if the culture was positive. During approximately 5.5 months, 7,733 WBP pools were RQI tested. There were 14 positive RQI tests; 12 WBP pools were sterile when cultured and considered false-positive RQI tests. One pool was positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, while another was positive for group B Streptococcus. The specificity and positive predictive value of the RQI test were 99.85% and 14.3%, respectively. The specificity and positive predictive value of the RQI test were higher than pH testing, leading to less waste of sterile WBP pools.",M2
20226836,"Proteome of <e>platelets</e> in patients with coronary artery disease.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the protein patterns of platelets from patients with stable or acute coronary atherosclerosis (CAD), in which platelets play a key role. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A proteomic approach was adopted to investigate specific protein patterns in platelets of patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, stable angina, or of subjects with no history of CAD. RESULTS: Six differentially expressed proteins were identified: two involved in energy metabolism (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase [OGDH], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]); three were associated with cytoskeleton-based processes (gamma-actin, coronin 1B, and pleckstrin); and one involved in protein degradation (proteasome subunit type 8). Expression levels of OGDH and a cleaved form of gamma-actin were significantly higher in the platelets of patients than in controls, whereas that of LDH was higher only in the platelets of patients with acute coronary disease. The increases in protein expression of OGDH and LDH are paralleled by changes in their functional activities. Coronin and proteasome subunit type 8 were less expressed in the platelets of patients, as were the basic isoforms of pleckstrin. CONCLUSION: The platelet proteome is altered in CAD patients with stable or acute coronary syndrome possibly because of the ongoing atherosclerotic process. The identified protein changes not previously connected with CAD were an increase in the energy metabolism enzymes and alterations in the proteins associated with cytoskeleton-based processes, both of which indicate platelet activation.",M2
20224444,"Agranular <e>platelets</e> as a cardinal feature of ARC syndrome.We aimed to describe abnormal platelet morphology and its clinical significance in infants who were diagnosed with arthrogryposis renal dysfunction and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome. We collected all of the cases of ARC syndrome referred to a single pediatric referral center. In all patients, platelet counts and analysis of platelet morphology were performed with peripheral blood smear specimens. Electron microscopy images were obtained to examine the ultrastructure of the platelets. Over the 12-year period, 12 cases of ARC syndrome were identified. The sex ratio (male:female) was 1:1. The median birth weight was 3.15 kg (range, 2.3 to 3.8 kg). Failure to thrive was observed in all the patients. The major cause of death was recurrent febrile illness and pneumonia. The median age at death was 8.9 months (range, 2.6 to 28.8 kg). Their median body weight at death was 3.1 kg (range, 2.6 to 6.0 kg). Close examination of their peripheral blood smear (n=11) specimens showed large, pale, agranular platelets similar to those seen in gray platelet syndrome. Electron microscopic images of the platelets (n=7) revealed a lack of alpha; granules. Agranular platelets are a common finding in ARC syndrome. Agranular platelets should be considered as a cardinal feature of ARC syndrome and can be useful as a noninvasive diagnostic marker for ARC syndrome.",M2
20223369,"Impact of chronic kidney disease on <e>platelet</e> function profiles in diabetes mellitus patients with coronary artery disease taking dual antiplatelet therapy.OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the impact of renal function on platelet reactivity in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease on aspirin and clopidogrel therapy. BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a key risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). In aspirin-treated DM patients the presence of moderate/severe CKD is associated with reduced clinical efficacy of adjunctive clopidogrel therapy. Whether these findings may be attributed to differences in clopidogrel-induced effects is unknown. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study in which DM patients taking maintenance aspirin and clopidogrel therapy were studied. Patients were categorized into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of moderate/severe CKD. Platelet aggregation after adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen stimuli were assessed with light transmittance aggregometry and defined patients with high post-treatment platelet reactivity (HPPR). Markers of platelet activation, including glycoprotein IIb/IIIa activation and P-selectin expression, were also determined using flow cytometry. RESULTS: A total of 306 DM patients were analyzed. Patients with moderate/severe CKD (n = 84) had significantly higher ADP-induced (60 +/- 13% vs. 52 +/- 15%, p = 0.001) and collagen-induced (49 +/- 20% vs. 41 +/- 20%, p = 0.004) platelet aggregation compared with those without (n = 222). After adjustment for potential confounders, patients with moderate/severe CKD were more likely to have HPPR after ADP (adjusted odds ratio: 3.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.7 to 8.5, p = 0.001) and collagen (adjusted odds ratio: 2.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 5.4; p = 0.029) stimuli. Markers of platelet activation were significantly increased in patients with HPPR. CONCLUSIONS: In DM patients with coronary artery disease taking maintenance aspirin and clopidogrel therapy, impaired renal function is associated with reduced clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet effects and a greater prevalence of HPPR.",M2
20219916,"B cells and <e>platelets</e> harbor prion infectivity in the blood of deer infected with chronic wasting disease.Substantial evidence for prion transmission via blood transfusion exists for many transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) diseases. Determining which cell phenotype(s) is responsible for trafficking infectivity has important implications for our understanding of the dissemination of prions, as well as their detection and elimination from blood products. We used bioassay studies of native white-tailed deer and transgenic cervidized mice to determine (i) if chronic wasting disease (CWD) blood infectivity is associated with the cellular versus the cell-free/plasma fraction of blood and (ii) in particular if B-cell (MAb 2-104(+)), platelet (CD41/61(+)), or CD14(+) monocyte blood cell phenotypes harbor infectious prions. All four deer transfused with the blood mononuclear cell fraction from CWD(+) donor deer became PrP(CWD) positive by 19 months postinoculation, whereas none of the four deer inoculated with cell-free plasma from the same source developed prion infection. All four of the deer injected with B cells and three of four deer receiving platelets from CWD(+) donor deer became PrP(CWD) positive in as little as 6 months postinoculation, whereas none of the four deer receiving blood CD14(+) monocytes developed evidence of CWD infection (immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis) after 19 months of observation. Results of the Tg(CerPrP) mouse bioassays mirrored those of the native cervid host. These results indicate that CWD blood infectivity is cell associated and suggest a significant role for B cells and platelets in trafficking CWD infectivity in vivo and support earlier tissue-based studies associating putative follicular B cells with PrP(CWD). Localization of CWD infectivity with leukocyte subpopulations may aid in enhancing the sensitivity of blood-based diagnostic assays for CWD and other TSEs.",M2
20218092,"Effects of glucosamine and Celadrin on <e>platelet</e> function.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of glucosamine and celadrin on platelet function. DESIGN: Baseline values were determined on the Chronolog 570VS platelet aggregometer with whole blood aggregation impedance readings using 2 different concentrations of ADP (5 microM, 10 microM), collagen (1 microg/mL), arachidonic acid (0.5 mM/L) and an Accumetrics whole blood platelet aggregation cartridge assay for P2Y12 receptors were obtained from 24 healthy volunteers. These subjects then took the suggested doses of Glucosamine with Celadrin (Stockbridge Naturals) as advertised (estimated 1500mg daily) for 2 weeks. Platelet aggregation analyses, as described above, were obtained after treatment. Statistics performed via a McNemar test. MAIN OUTCOME: Five of twenty-four subjects had at least a 20% difference in whole blood aggregation using the 5 microM concentration of ADP. A total of 6 and 7 subjects also showed a significant difference in platelet aggregation with administration of collagen and arachidonic acid, respectively. No significant differences were found with Accumetrics assay for P2Y12 in any of the subjects. CONCLUSION: Glucosamine and celadrin may inhibit platelet aggregation in some individuals via aspirin-like effects as well as inhibition of ADP receptor P2Y1 but not P2Y12.",M2
20213276,"<e>Platelet</e>-derived chemokines: pathophysiology and therapeutic aspects.The identification of chemokines in blood platelets has strengthened our view of these cells as participants in immune host defense. Platelet chemokines representing prestored and rapidly releasable proteins may play a major role as first-line inflammatory mediators. This is evident from their capability to recruit early inflammatory cells such as neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes and even to exhibit direct antimicrobial activity. However, insight is growing that platelet chemokines may be also long-term regulators, e.g., by activating T lymphocytes, by modulating the formation of endothelium and even thrombocytopoiesis itself. This review deals with the individual and cooperative functionality of platelet chemokines, as well as their potential as a basis for therapeutic intervention in the pathology of inflammation, infection, allergy and tumors. Within this context, therapeutic strategies based on the use of antibodies, modified chemokines, chemokine-binding proteins and chemokine receptor antagonists as well as first clinical studies will be addressed.",M2
20210555,"Bacterial-<e>platelet</e> interactions: virulence meets host defense.Platelets have historically been viewed as cell fragments that only mediate blood coagulation. Yet, platelets have as - or perhaps even more - important roles in tissue remodeling, modulation of inflammation and antimicrobial host defense. It is evident that platelets interact with prokaryotes directly and indirectly through multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms. The important roles of platelets in antibacterial host defense can be exemplified through contemporary themes in platelet immunobiology. Platelets have unambiguous structures and functions of host defense effector cells. Recent discoveries reveal platelet expression of toll-like and purinonergic receptors, which enable detection and response to bacterial infection, degranulation of an array of microbicidal peptides and coordination of other molecular and cellular host defenses. From multiple perspectives, platelets are now increasingly recognized as critical innate immune effector cells that also bridge and facilitate optimization of adaptive immunity. It follows that clinical deficiencies in platelet quantity or quality are now recognized correlates of increased risk and severity of bacterial and other infections. Along these lines, new evidence suggests that certain prokaryotic organisms may be capable of exploiting platelet interactions to gain a virulence advantage. Indeed, certain bacterial pathogens appear to have evolved highly coordinated means by which to seize opportunities to bind to surfaces of activated platelets, and exploit them to establish or propagate infection. Hence, it is conceivable that certain bacterial pathogens subvert platelet functions. From these perspectives, the net consequences of bacterial virulence versus platelet host defenses likely decide initial steps towards the ultimate result of infection versus immunity.",M2
20207008,"<e>Platelet</e> serotonin transporter function after short-term paroxetine treatment in patients with panic disorder.Dysfunctions in serotonin neurotransmission have been implicated in some psychiatric disorders, and in particular, altered serotonin transporter function has been noted in panic disorder. In this study, the authors compared platelet [(3)H]serotonin uptake parameters, including maximum velocities (V(max)) and affinity constants (K(m)), in patients with panic disorder not undergoing treatment (n=21) and in healthy subjects (n=20). V(max) and K(m) values were re-examined after 12 weeks of paroxetine treatment. Values of V(max) and K(m) were lower in panic disorder patients at baseline than in healthy subjects. After treatment, K(m) normalized in panic patients, whereas V(max) did not change. A significant inverse correlation was found between increased K(m) and changes in anxiety levels. These results support a hypothesis of serotonergic transporter abnormalities in panic disorder, and suggest that increased K(m) values of platelet serotonin transporters parallel clinical improvement after short-term pharmacotherapy in panic disorder.",M2
20206795,"Influence of Ginkgo biloba extract on the pharmacodynamic effects and pharmacokinetic properties of ticlopidine: an open-label, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, single-dose crossover study in healthy Korean male volunteers.BACKGROUND:Ginkgo biloba extract is an herbal medicine used in the treatment of vascular disorders that may be coadministered with antiplatelet agents such as ticlopidine. Regulatory authorities requested evaluation of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between these entities, according to the drug-development guidance for fixed-dose combination formulations in Korea. OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to evaluate the potential pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between ticlopidine and Ginkgo biloba extract. METHODS: An open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment, 2-sequence, single-dose crossover study was conducted in healthy Korean male volunteers. All volunteers were randomly assigned to a sequence group for the 2 treatments, which consisted of ticlopidine 250 mg alone and ticlopidine 250 mg with Ginkgo biloba extract 80 mg, separated by a 1-week washout period between the treatments. Bleeding time was determined just before dosing and at 5, 12, and 48 hours after dosing. <e>Platelet</e> aggregation was evaluated before dosing and at 4, 8, 26, and 48 hours after dosing. Blood samples (8 mL) from each of the volunteers were collected from an indwelling intravenous cannula inserted into a forearm vein before dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after dosing. Ticlopidine concentrations were determined by a validated method using HPLC and ultraviolet detection. Adverse events were identified using general health-related questions, vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, and laboratory tests. RESULTS: A total of 24 healthy men participated in the study (mean [SD] age, 24.1 [4.3] years; weight, 66.6 [7.4] kg; height, 174.7 [5.0] cm). The baseline corrected bleeding times were not significantly different between the ticlopidine-alone and ticlopidine/ Ginkgo biloba groups, and changes in platelet aggregation were not significantly different between the groups. Likewise, the pharmacokinetic parameters of ticlopidine were not significantly different between the groups; the geometric mean ratios of the ticlopidine/ Ginkgo biloba group to the ticlopidine-alone group were 1.03 (90% CI, 0.92-1.16) for C(max), 1.08 (90% CI, 0.98-1.19) for AUC(0-last), and 1.10 (90% CI, 1.00-1.20) for AUC(0-infinity). A total of 28 adverse events were reported: 11 in the ticlopidine-alone group and 17 in the ticlopidine/Ginkgo biloba group. The adverse events judged to be possibly related to ticlopidine in the ticlopidine-alone group were epigastric discomfort (2 cases), diarrhea (1), skin eruption (1), and a feeling of being cold (1) or hot (1). The adverse events judged to be related to ticlopidine or Ginkgo biloba in the ticlopidine/Ginkgo biloba group were epigastric discomfort (2), diarrhea (2), nausea (2), and headache (1). CONCLUSIONS: In this small group of healthy Korean men, the addition of a single dose of Ginkgo biloba extract did not prolong the bleeding time and was not associated with additional antiplatelet effects compared with the administration of ticlopidine alone. The coadministration of Ginkgo biloba extract with ticlopidine was not associated with any significant changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of ticlopidine compared with ticlopidine administered alone.",M2
20206794,"Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of single doses of prasugrel 30 mg and clopidogrel 300 mg in healthy Chinese and white volunteers: an open-label trial.BACKGROUND: Prasugrel is an oral antiplatelet agent approved for the reduction of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Although the approved loading dose is 60 mg, earlier studies of prasugrel suggested that active-metabolite exposure and pharmacodynamic response may be higher in Asian subjects than in white subjects. OBJECTIVES: This study compared the pharmacodynamic response to a single 30-mg dose of prasugrel in healthy Chinese and white subjects and the response to a single 30-mg dose of prasugrel and a single 300-mg dose of clopidogrel in healthy Chinese subjects. The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of both drugs were also assessed. METHODS: This was an open-label, single-dose study conducted in Singapore. Chinese subjects were randomly allocated to receive prasugrel 30 mg or clopidogrel 300 mg; after a 14-day washout period, they received the alternative drug. White subjects received only prasugrel 30 mg. Blood samples for pharmaco-dynamic assessments were collected before dosing and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours after dosing. Three methods were used to measure inhibition of <e>platelet</e> aggregation (IPA)-traditional light transmission aggregometry (LTA), the Verify Now P2Y12 (VN-P2Y12) assay, and a vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation flow cytometry assay-and their results were compared. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessments were collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. Concentrations of the active metabolite of prasugrel were measured using a validated LC-MS/MS method. RESULTS: The study enrolled 18 Chinese subjects and 14 white subjects. Chinese subjects had a mean (SD) age of 31 (10) years and a mean body weight of 65.2 (8.9) kg; 83% were male. The corresponding values for white subjects were 30 (10) years, 77.2 (12.4) kg, and 86%. Thirty of the 32 enrolled subjects completed the study. Two Chinese men were withdrawn from the study, one due to a low platelet-rich plasma count after receipt of prasugrel 30 mg and the other due to mild, intermittent rectal bleeding after bowel movements that began approximately 2 days after receipt of clopidogrel 300 mg. The mean IPA with prasugrel was significantly higher in Chinese than in white subjects at 0.5, 1, and 2 hours after dosing (P &lt; 0.05), but not at 4 or 24 hours. In Chinese subjects, mean maximal IPA (87%) occurred 1 hour after prasugrel dosing; in white subjects, mean maximal IPA (78%) occurred 2 hours after prasugrel dosing. In Chinese subjects, the mean IPA was significantly higher at all time points after administration of prasugrel 30 mg than after administration of clopidogrel 300 mg (P &lt;0.001). After administration of Clopidogrel 300 mg in Chinese subjects, mean maximal IPA (58%) occurred at 4 hours. The VN-P2Y12 and VASP phosphorylation assays yielded results comparable to those obtained by LTA. Mean exposure to prasugrel's active metabolite was higher in Chinese than in white subjects (geometric least squares mean ratio for AUC(0-t) = 1.47 (90% CI, 1.24-1.73). Both drugs were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, platelet inhibition was significantly higher in Chinese than in white subjects up to 2 hours after a single 30-mg dose of prasugrel. Platelet inhibition was significantly higher in Chinese subjects at all time points after a 30-mg dose of prasugrel than after a 300-mg dose of clopidogrel. Both treatments were generally well tolerated.",M2
20203303,"<e>Platelets</e> play an essential role in separating the blood and lymphatic vasculatures during embryonic angiogenesis.RATIONALE: Several mutations that impair the development of blood lineages in the mouse also impair the formation of the lymphatic vasculature and its separation from the blood vasculature. However, the basis for these defects has remained unknown because the mutations characterized affect more than one blood lineage. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that megakaryocytes/platelets are required for the formation of the lymphatic vasculature and its separation from the blood vascular system. METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized the vascular patterning defects of mice deficient for the homeodomain transcription factor Meis1 (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1), which completely lack megakaryocyte/platelets. Meis1 null embryos fail to separate the blood and lymphatic vasculature, showing blood-filled primary lymphatic sacs and superficial lymphatic vessels. To test the involvement of megakaryocytes/platelets in this phenotype, we generated megakaryocyte/platelet-specific deficient mice by targeted lineage ablation, without affecting other blood lineages. This model reproduces the lymphatic/blood vasculature separation defects observed in Meis1 mutants. A similar phenotype was induced by antibody-mediated ablation of circulating platelets in wild type mice. Strong association of platelets with vascular endothelium at regions of contact between lymphatic sacs and veins confirmed a direct role of platelets in the separation of the 2 vasculatures. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to their known protective function in the response accidental vascular injury, platelets are also required during embryonic lymphangiogenesis for the separation of the nascent lymphatic vasculature from blood vessels.",M2
20200351,"<e>Platelet</e> interleukin-1alpha drives cerebrovascular inflammation.White blood cell infiltration across an activated brain endothelium contributes to neurologic disease, including cerebral ischemia and multiple sclerosis. Identifying mechanisms of cerebrovascular activation is therefore critical to our understanding of brain disease. Platelet accumulation in microvessels of ischemic mouse brain was associated with endothelial activation in vivo. Mouse platelets expressed interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), but not IL-1beta, induced endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), and enhanced the release of CXC chemokine CXCL1 when incubated with primary cultures of brain endothelial cells from wild-type or IL-1alpha/beta-deficient mice. A neutralizing antibody to IL-1alpha (but not IL-1beta) or application of IL-1 receptor antagonist inhibited platelet-induced endothelial activation by more than 90%. Platelets from IL-1alpha/beta-deficient mice did not induce expression of adhesion molecules in cerebrovascular endothelial cells and did not promote CXCL1 release in vitro. Conditioned medium from activated platelets induced an IL-1alpha-dependent activation of mouse brain endothelial cells and supported the transendothelial migration of neutrophils in vitro. Thus, we have identified platelets as a key source of IL-1alpha and propose that platelet activation of brain endothelium via IL-1alpha is a critical step for the entry of white blood cells, major contributors to inflammation-mediated injury in the brain.",M2
20200350,"Mutation and ADAMTS13-dependent modulation of disease severity in a mouse model for von Willebrand disease type 2B.Von Willebrand disease (VWD)-type 2B originates from a gain-of-function mutation in von Willebrand factor (VWF), resulting in enhanced <e>platelet</e> binding. Clinical manifestations include increased bleeding tendency, loss of large multimers, thrombocytopenia, and circulating platelet aggregates. We developed a mouse model to study phenotypic consequences of VWD-type 2B mutations in murine VWF: mVWF/R1306Q and mVWF/V1316M. Both mutations allow normal multimerization but are associated with enhanced ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation, typical for VWD-type 2B. In vivo expression resulted in thrombocytopenia and circulating aggregates, both of which were more pronounced for mVWF/V1316M. Furthermore, both mutants did not support correction of bleeding time or arterial vessel occlusion in a thrombosis model. They further displayed a 2- to 3-fold reduced half-life and induced a 3- to 6-fold increase in number of giant platelets compared with wild-type VWF. Loss of large multimers was observed in 50% of the mice. The role of ADAMTS13 was investigated by expressing both mutants in VWF/ADAMTS13 double-deficient mice. ADAMTS13 deficiency resulted in more and larger circulating platelet aggregates for both mutants, whereas the full multimer range remained present in all mice. Thus, we established a mouse model for VWD-type 2B and found that phenotype depends on mutation and ADAMTS13.",M2
20197627,"Basic principles of <e>platelet</e> biology and clinical implications.Platelet activation and subsequent accumulation at sites of vascular injury are the first steps in hemostasis. Excessive platelet activation after atherosclerotic plaque rupture or endothelial cell erosion may also lead to the formation of occlusive thrombi, which are responsible for acute ischemic events. Multiple pathways are involved in platelet activation, including those activated by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)), serotonin, collagen, and thrombin. Antiplatelet agents used for prevention of atherothrombosis have focused on blocking the formation of TXA(2) (eg, aspirin) and interfering with ADP stimulation mediated by the P2Y(12) receptor (eg, clopidogrel). These agents, used alone or in combination, significantly decrease the risk for atherothrombotic events, but a significant residual risk for recurrent ischemic events remains. This has been, in part, attributed to persistence of elevated platelet reactivity despite the use of these agents. Several novel antiplatelet agents are currently under clinical development, with the goal of achieving more efficacious platelet inhibition. These include agents that more efficiently block TXA(2)-mediated effects, as well as more potent P2Y(12) receptor antagonists. In addition, inhibition of the protease-activated receptor-1 platelet activation pathway stimulated by thrombin has emerged as a rational target for clinical development. An overview of the basic principles of platelet biology is given and currently available antiplatelet agents, as well as those under clinical development, are reviewed.",M2
20196724,"The balance between von-Willebrand factor and its cleaving protease ADAMTS13: biomarker in systemic inflammation and development of organ failure?PURPOSE: This review investigates and highlights the activity of Willebrand factor (VWF) and its cleaving protease as biomarkers of the development of multiple organ dysfunction in infectious and noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome. STATE OF THE ART: Ultra-large VWF (ULVWF) multimers activate <e>platelets</e> resulting in a prothrombotic situation. Systemic inflammation is associated with increased ULVWF plasma level and a decreased ADAMTS13 activity. The potential role of ADAMTS13 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy is largely underestimated. SUMMARY: VWF is an acute phase protein and its plasma level increases in systemic inflammation. When released from endothelial cells and platelets, the native multimeric glycoprotein is mostly present in the ultralarge form (ULVWF), which may have a major clinical significance under proinflammatory conditions. ULVWF-multimers may activate endothelial cells and platelets simultaneously. The multimers undergo limited proteolysis by a specific plasma metalloprotease known as ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motif), thus, in healthy individuals only marginal amounts of circulating ULVWF are detectable. Severe hereditary or acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency causes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which contributes to prothrombotic coagulation abnormalities preceding organ dysfunction systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). In proinflammatory conditions, ADAMTS13 activity decreases due to various mechanisms, (i) down regulation on a transcriptional level, (ii) proteolytic degradation, and (iii) consumption due to the high substrate level. Marked dysbalance as found in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock results in substantial amounts of plasma ULVWF. This level of dysbalance is negatively correlated with platelet count and positively correlated with the severity of inflammation and the degree of organ failure.",M2
20196420,"Effect of Ayurved Siriraj herbal recipe Chantaleela on <e>platelet</e> aggregation.INTRODUCTION: Ayurved Siriraj Chantaleela recipe is a traditional Thai remedy consisting of eight medicinal plants, which is employed for the treatment of fever. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Ayurved Siriraj Herbal recipe Chantaleela on platelet aggregation. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical research; ex vivo with before and after study design. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Twelve healthy male and female volunteers participated in the present study. Platelet aggregation test before Chantaleela ingestion was done as a control. After administration of 750 mg Chantaleela (3 x 250 mg tablets) every 8 hours for 3 doses, platelet aggregation was measured 8 hours following the first dose using an aggregometer and microplate reader. Adrenaline (Adr) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were used as platelet stimulants. Platelet aggregation was measured again at 32 hours and 8-10 days after the first dose. RESULTS: All of the participants completed the present study without any adverse event. Ayurved Siriraj Chantaleela did not affect platelet aggregation; neither Adr nor ADP were used as platelet agonists in both aggregometer and microplate reader Subgroup analysis revealed no significant change in platelet aggregation after Chantaleela administration according to the control for both male and female groups. The same results were also obtained in other subgroup analysis including hyperaggregation group, hypo-normal aggregation group. CONCLUSION: From the present study, normal dose of Chantaleela for alleviation of fever does not have an effect on either platelet aggregation or platelet numbers. It may conclude that the present study supports the safety use of Chantaleela for relieving fever as platelet status does not need to be taken into consideration.",M2
20195121,"Treatment of diabetic foot ulcers using a blood bank <e>platelet</e> concentrate.BACKGROUND: Many clinical trials have shown the effectiveness of platelet releasate on chronic wound healing, but large volumes of blood must be aspirated from patients and a platelet separator is required. Moreover, in the case of using homologous platelets, time and effort are needed to locate a suitable donor, and the donor's blood sample must be tested for a history of infectious disease. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of a straightforward method using a blood bank platelet concentrate in treating diabetic foot ulcers. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with diabetic foot ulcers were treated using a blood bank platelet concentrate. A control treatment (i.e., treatment with topical fibrinogen and thrombin) was performed on 48 patients. Twelve weeks after treatment, the percentage of complete healing, mean healing time, percentage of wound shrinkage, and patient satisfaction were compared. RESULTS: Complete wound healing was achieved in 79 percent of the blood bank platelet concentrate-treated group and 46 percent of the control group (p &lt; 0.05). The times required for complete healing were 7.0 +/- 1.9 and 9.2 +/- 2.2 weeks in the blood bank platelet concentrate-treated and control groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). The degrees of wound shrinkage were 96.3 +/- 7.8 and 81.6 +/- 19.7 percent for the treated and control groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Patient satisfaction with the blood bank platelet concentrate treatment yielded better results than the control method (mean score, 7.6 +/- 1.6 and 5.3 +/- 1.4, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). No adverse events related to the study treatment occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of diabetic foot ulcers using a blood bank platelet concentrate showed results superior to control treatment. A blood bank platelet concentrate offers a simple and effective treatment for diabetic foot ulcers.",M2
20194899,"Deadly allies: the fatal interplay between <e>platelets</e> and metastasizing cancer cells.The general notion that functional platelets are important for successful hematogenous tumor metastasis has been inaugurated more than 4 decades ago and has since been corroborated in numerous experimental settings. Thorough preclinical investigations have, at least in part, clarified some specifics regarding the involvement of platelet adhesion receptors, such as thrombin receptors or integrins, in the metastasis cascade. Pivotal preclinical experiments have demonstrated that hematogenous tumor spread was dramatically diminished when platelets were depleted from the circulation or when functions of platelet surface receptors were inhibited pharmacologically or genetically. Such insight has inspired researchers to devise novel antitumoral therapies based on targeting platelet receptors. However, several mechanistic aspects underlying the impact of platelet receptors on tumor metastasis are not fully understood, and agents directed against platelet receptors have not yet found their way into the clinic. In addition, recent results suggesting that targeted inhibition of certain platelet surface receptors may even result in enhanced experimental tumor metastasis have demonstrated vividly that the role of platelets in tumor metastasis is more complex than has been anticipated previously. This review gives a comprehensive overview on the most important platelet receptors and their putative involvement in hematogenous metastasis of malignant tumors.",M2

20193966,"Ultrastructural changes and immunolocalization of P-selectin in <e>platelets</e> from patients with major depression.Depression is considered an important risk factor in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although the biological mechanism is unknown, it has been suggested that hyperactivity of platelets may have an important role in the onset and evolution of cardiovascular damage. The goals of this study were to evaluate by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry the presence of ultra-structural variations in platelets from individuals with recent diagnosis of major depression disease (MDD, patients without previous anti-depressant treatment and from healthy control subjects.). Platelets from depressed patients had a greater proportion of dendritic forms compared with those obtained from control subjects. Morphological changes, such as dilation of open canalicular and dense tubular systems, platelet vacuolization, electrodense pattern of membranes, and a different immunolocalization of P-selectin were observed in the platelets from depressed patients compared with those isolated from healthy subjects. Our results revealed ultra-structural changes in platelets isolated from patients with MDD suggestive of enhanced platelet activation.",M2
20191341,"Synthesis of new 4,5-3(2H)pyridazinone derivatives and their cardiotonic, hypotensive, and <e>platelet</e> aggregation inhibition activities.4,5-dihydro-3(2H)pyridazinones such as CI-914, CI-930 and pimobendan along with tetrahydropyridopyridazine (endralazine) and perhydropyridazinodiazepine (cilazopril) have been used as potent positive inotropes, antihypertensives as well as platelet aggregation inhibitors. Accordingly, the present work involves the synthesis of 24 target compounds; 4,5-dihydro-3(2H)pyridazinones in addition to seven reported intermediates. The chemical structures of the new compounds were assigned by microanalysis, IR, 1H-NMR spectral analysis and some representatives by mass spectrometry. The positive inotropic effect of the final compounds and the intermediates 12a-12d as well as the reported intermediate compound 10 was determined in-vitro on isolated rabbit heart in comparison to digoxin. Data obtained revealed that twelve of the test compounds exhibited higher effective response than digoxin, nine compounds elicited comparable effects to digoxin and eight compounds were less active than digoxin. In addition, four compounds approved marked significant hypotensive effect better than that of the previously reported compound 10. Moreover, two compounds induced complete platelet aggregation inhibition. The last two compounds were also subjected to determination of their LD50 and they showed no signs of toxicity up to the dose level 300 mg/kg (i.p.), while the reported oral LD50 of digoxin is 17.78 mg/kg. Correlation of cardiotonic and hypotensive activities with structures of compounds was tried and pharmacophore models were computed to get useful insight onto the essential structural features required for inhibiting phosphodiesterase-III in the heart muscles and blood vessels.",M2
20189992,"An important role of the SRC family kinase Lyn in stimulating <e>platelet</e> granule secretion.The Src family kinases (SFKs) have been proposed to play stimulatory and inhibitory roles in platelet activation. The mechanisms for these apparently contradictory roles are unclear. Here we show that SFK, mainly Lyn, is important in stimulating a common signaling pathway leading to secretion of platelet granules. Lyn knock-out or an isoform-nonselective SFK inhibitor, PP2, inhibited platelet secretion of both dense and alpha granules and the secretion-dependent platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, collagen, and thromboxane A(2). The inhibitory effect of Lyn knock-out on platelet aggregation was reversed by supplementing granule content ADP, indicating that the primary role of Lyn is to stimulate granule secretion. Inhibitory effect of PP2 on platelet aggregation induced by thrombin and thromboxane A(2) were also reversed by supplementing ADP. Furthermore, PP2 treatment or Lyn knock-out diminished agonist-induced Akt activation and cyclic GMP production. The inhibitory effect of PP2 or Lyn knock-out on platelet response can be corrected by supplementing cyclic GMP. These data indicate that Lyn stimulates platelet secretion by activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt-nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic GMP pathway and also provide an explanation why Lyn can both stimulate and inhibit platelet activation.",M2

ANIMALS: 10 hound-crossbred dogs. PROCEDURES: Aspirin (10 mg/kg, PO, q 12 h), carprofen (4.4 mg/kg, PO, q 24 h), deracoxib (2 mg/kg, PO, q 24 h), meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg, PO, q 24 h), and a placebo were administered for 7 days in a random order to each of 10 healthy dogs; there was a 21-day washout period between subsequent treatments. One-stage prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen concentration, and plasma concentrations of thromboxane (TX)B(2) and 6-keto prostaglandin (PG)F(1alpha) were measured before and after treatment administration. Platelet function was assessed by use of a platelet-function analyzer and aggregation. RESULTS: Aspirin, carprofen, and meloxicam did not significantly affect platelet function. Deracoxib caused a mild decrease in platelet aggregation induced by 50microM ADP. Platelet number, Hct, PT, aPTT, and plasma TXB(2) and 6-keto PGF(1alpha) concentrations were unchanged after NSAID administration. Meloxicam administration resulted in a significant decrease in fibrinogen concentration, but results remained within the laboratory reference interval. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Oral administration of commonly used NSAIDs at therapeutic dosages in healthy dogs did not alter plasma TXB(2) and 6-keto PGF(1alpha) concentrations. Deracoxib administration resulted in a minor abnormality in platelet aggregation. Anti-inflammatory doses of aspirin did not affect platelet function as measured by use of optical aggregometry and a platelet-function analyzer. Further evaluation of the effects of aspirin and cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors on hemostasis should be performed.",M2
20181815,"Establishing optimal selenium status: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Dietary recommendations for selenium differ between countries, mainly because of uncertainties over the definition of optimal selenium status. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the dose-response relations for different forms of selenium. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary intervention was carried out in 119 healthy men and women aged 50-64 y living in the United Kingdom. Daily placebo or selenium-enriched yeast tablets containing 50, 100, or 200 microg Se ( approximately 60% selenomethionine), selenium-enriched onion meals ( approximately 66% gamma-glutamyl-methylselenocysteine, providing the equivalent of 50 microg Se/d), or unenriched onion meals were consumed for 12 wk. Changes in <e>platelet</e> glutathione peroxidase activity and in plasma selenium and selenoprotein P concentrations were measured. RESULTS: The mean baseline plasma selenium concentration for all subjects was 95.7 +/- 11.5 ng/mL, which increased significantly by 10 wk to steady state concentrations of 118.3 +/- 13.1, 152.0 +/- 24.3, and 177.4 +/- 26.3 ng/mL in those who consumed 50, 100, or 200 microg Se-yeast/d, respectively. Platelet glutathione peroxidase activity did not change significantly in response to either dose or form of selenium. Selenoprotein P increased significantly in all selenium intervention groups from an overall baseline mean of 4.99 +/- 0.80 microg/mL to 6.17 +/- 0.85, 6.73 +/- 1.01, 6.59 +/- 0.64, and 5.72 +/- 0.75 microg/mL in those who consumed 50, 100, or 200 microg Se-yeast/d and 50 microg Se-enriched onions/d, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma selenoprotein P is a useful biomarker of status in populations with relatively low selenium intakes because it responds to different dietary forms of selenium. To optimize the plasma selenoprotein P concentration in this study, 50 microg Se/d was required in addition to the habitual intake of approximately 55 microg/d. In the context of established relations between plasma selenium and risk of cancer and mortality, and recognizing the important functions of selenoprotein P, these results provide important evidence for deriving estimated average requirements for selenium in adults. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00279812.",M2
20181715,"Pathogenic hantaviruses direct the adherence of quiescent <e>platelets</e> to infected endothelial cells.Hantavirus infections are noted for their ability to infect endothelial cells, cause acute thrombocytopenia, and trigger 2 vascular-permeability-based diseases. However, hantavirus infections are not lytic, and the mechanisms by which hantaviruses cause capillary permeability and thrombocytopenia are only partially understood. The role of beta(3) integrins in hemostasis and the inactivation of beta(3) integrin receptors by pathogenic hantaviruses suggest the involvement of hantaviruses in altered platelet and endothelial cell functions that regulate permeability. Here, we determined that pathogenic hantaviruses bind to quiescent platelets via a beta(3) integrin-dependent mechanism. This suggests that platelets may contribute to hantavirus dissemination within infected patients and provides a means by which hantavirus binding to beta(3) integrin receptors prevents platelet activation. The ability of hantaviruses to bind platelets further suggested that cell-associated hantaviruses might recruit platelets to the endothelial cell surface. Our findings indicate that Andes virus (ANDV)- or Hantaan virus (HTNV)-infected endothelial cells specifically direct the adherence of calcein-labeled platelets. In contrast, cells comparably infected with nonpathogenic Tula virus (TULV) failed to recruit platelets to the endothelial cell surface. Platelet adherence was dependent on endothelial cell beta(3) integrins and neutralized by the addition of the anti-beta(3) Fab fragment, c7E3, or specific ANDV- or HTNV-neutralizing antibodies. These findings indicate that pathogenic hantaviruses displayed on the surface of infected endothelial cells bind platelets and that a platelet layer covers the surface of infected endothelial cells. This fundamentally changes the appearance of endothelial cells and has the potential to alter cellular immune responses, platelet activation, and endothelial cell functions that affect vascular permeability. Hantavirus-directed platelet quiescence and recruitment to vast endothelial cell beds further suggests mechanisms by which hantaviruses may cause thrombocytopenia and induce hypoxia. These findings are fundamental to our understanding of pathogenic-hantavirus regulation of endothelial cell responses that contribute to vascular permeability.",M2
20181616,"RUNX1/core binding factor A2 regulates <e>platelet</e> 12-lipoxygenase gene (ALOX12): studies in human RUNX1 haplodeficiency.Haploinsufficiency of RUNX1 (also known as CBFA2/AML1) is associated with familial thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, and predisposition to acute leukemia. We have reported on a patient with thrombocytopenia and impaired agonist-induced aggregation, secretion, and protein phosphorylation associated with a RUNX1 mutation. Expression profiling of platelets revealed approximately 5-fold decreased expression of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO, gene ALOX12), which catalyzes 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production from arachidonic acid. We hypothesized that ALOX12 is a direct transcriptional target gene of RUNX1. In present studies, agonist-induced platelet 12-HETE production was decreased in the patient. Four RUNX1 consensus sites were identified in the 2-kb promoter region of ALOX12 (at -1498, -1491, -708, -526 from ATG). In luciferase reporter studies in human erythroleukemia cells, mutation of each site decreased activity; overexpression of RUNX1 up-regulated promoter activity, which was abolished by mutation of RUNX1 sites. Gel shift studies, including with recombinant protein, revealed RUNX1 binding to each site. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed in vivo RUNX1 binding in the region of interest. siRNA knockdown of RUNX1 decreased RUNX1 and 12-LO proteins. ALOX12 is a direct transcriptional target of RUNX1. Our studies provide further proof of principle that platelet expression profiling can elucidate novel alterations in platelets with inherited dysfunction.",M2
20179577,"Ephedra alkaloids inhibit <e>platelet</e> aggregation.Sympathomimetics, such as Ephedra alkaloids, are associated with an increased incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage believed to be secondary to concomitant elevations in blood pressure. We hypothesized that sympathomimetics decrease platelet aggregation. Reductions in epinephrine-mediated platelet aggregation by ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, and racemic amphetamine were determined by measuring the changes that these sympathomimetics induced in the optical density of platelet-rich plasma from healthy individuals. Intracellular signal transduction was followed ex vivo by assaying the release of intracellular cyclic AMP and the ligand for the cytokine chemoreceptor 5 (RANTES) into platelet rich plasma. The effect of ephedrine on epinephrine-mediated increases in platelet selectin (CD62p) activation was assessed with flow cytometry. Data were analyzed with repeated-measures analyses of variance. Aggregation responses to epinephrine were greatly reduced in the presence of commonly used sympathomimetics such as ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, and racemic amphetamine that have been found in cold remedies, appetite suppressants, or used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, respectively. Ephedrine diminished aggregation responses to ADP and gamma-thrombin, and this sympathomimetic reduced RANTES exocytosis, basal CD62p expression, and aggregation in platelets exposed to caffeine. Caffeine enhanced the effect of ephedrine on platelet function, and phenylpropanolamine amplified the inhibitory effect of aspirin on platelet aggregation. Sympathomimetics significantly alter platelet function, and they may increase the potential for bleeding independently of their effects on blood pressure. Despite restrictions imposed on their use, the consumption of sympathomimetics should be considered when any patient presents with findings of cerebral hemorrhage.",M2
20176344,"Choukroun's <e>platelet</e>-rich fibrin (PRF) stimulates in vitro proliferation and differentiation of human oral bone mesenchymal stem cell in a dose-dependent way.BACKGROUND: Choukroun's platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is an autologous leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin biomaterial. The purpose of this study was to analyse the in vitro effects of PRF on human bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC), harvested in the oral cavity after preimplant endosteal stimulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BMSCs from primary cultures were cultivated with or without a PRF membrane originating from the same donor as for the cells, in proliferation or osteoblastic differentiation conditions. After 7 days, the PRF membranes were removed. A series of cultures were performed using 2 PRF membranes, in order to measure the dose-dependent effect. Cell counts, cytotoxicity tests, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity quantification, Von Kossa staining and mineralisation nodules counts were performed at 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. A last independent series was carried on up to 14 days, for a morphological scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. RESULTS: PRF generated a significant stimulation of the BMSC proliferation and differentiation throughout the experimental period. This effect was dose-dependent during the first weeks in normal conditions, and during the whole experimentation in differentiation conditions. The cultures without PRF in differentiation conditions did not rise above the degree of differentiation of the cultures in normal conditions with 1 or 2 PRF up to the 14th and 28th day, respectively. The SEM culture analysis at day 14 allowed to show the mineralisation nodules which were more numerous and more structured in the groups with PRF compared to the control groups. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This double contradictory proliferation/differentiation result may be due to the numerous components of PRF, particularly the presence of leukocytes: any culture with PRF is in fact a coculture with leukocytes. It could be the source of differential geographic regulation processes within the culture. The combination of oral BMSC and PRF might offer many potential clinical and biotechnological applications, and deserves new studies.",M2
20176027,"Mutations in TTC37 cause trichohepatoenteric syndrome (phenotypic diarrhea of infancy).BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THES) is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by life-threatening diarrhea in infancy, immunodeficiency, liver disease, trichorrhexis nodosa, facial dysmorphism, hypopigmentation, and cardiac defects. We attempted to characterize the phenotype and elucidate the molecular basis of THES. METHODS: Twelve patients with classic THES from 11 families had detailed phenotyping. Autozygosity mapping was undertaken in 8 patients from consanguineous families using 250,000 single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and linked regions evaluated using microsatellite markers. Linkage was confirmed to one region from which candidate genes were analyzed. The effect of mutations on protein production and/or localization in hepatocytes and intestinal epithelial cells from affected patients was characterized by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Previously unrecognized <e>platelet</e> abnormalities (reduced platelet alpha-granules, unusual stimulated alpha granule content release, abnormal lipid inclusions, abnormal platelet canalicular system, and reduced number of microtubules) were identified. The THES locus was mapped to 5q14.3-5q21.2. Sequencing of candidate genes showed mutations in TTC37, which encodes the uncharacterized tetratricopeptide repeat protein, thespin. Bioinformatic analysis suggested thespin to be involved in protein-protein interactions or chaperone. Preliminary studies of enterocyte brush-border ion transporter proteins (sodium hydrogen exchanger 2, sodium hydrogen exchanger 3, aquaporin 7, sodium iodide symporter, and hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase [ATPase]) showed reduced expression or mislocalization in all THES patients with different profiles for each. In contrast the basolateral localization of Na/K ATPase was not altered. CONCLUSIONS: THES is caused by mutations in TTC37. TTC37 mutations have a multisystem effect, which may be owing to abnormal stability and/or intracellular localization of TTC37 target proteins.",M2
20174756,"The direct thrombin inhibitor argatroban effectively prevents cardiac catheter thrombosis in vitro.The direct thrombin inhibitor argatroban offers some significant advantages over unfractionated heparin (UFH) and is recommended as an alternative anticoagulant during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The impact of argatroban on cardiac catheter thrombosis--a severe potential complication of PCI--has not been systematically studied yet. The aim of the present study was to test in vitro the hypothesis that argatroban is equivalent to the more established anticoagulants UFH and enoxaparin in preventing catheter thrombus formation. Blood pretreated with the anticoagulants of interest was continuously circulated through a guiding catheter by using a roller pump for a maximum experimental period of 60 minutes. In an alternate model, coagulation was mechanically induced by a magnetic stirrer. Coagulation parameters, overall thrombus weight and electron microscopic features (deposits of <e>platelets</e> and fibrin on the catheter surface) were quantified as endpoints. Argatroban (administered as bolus or continuous infusion), UFH (bolus), and enoxaparin (bolus) significantly reduced catheter thrombus formation compared to untreated controls. Here, neither overall thrombus weight nor platelet/fibrin deposition was different among the specific anticoagulants. Declining ACT (activated clotting time) levels--which were found in the argatroban bolus group--could be prevented by continuous infusion. In magnetic stirrer-induced coagulation, thrombus weight was lower following bolus treatment with UFH and enoxaparin compared to argatroban. These data suggest that the potential for argatroban in preventing catheter thrombosis is comparable to that of UFH and enoxaparin. However, the anticoagulatory efficacy varied, depending on the model of coagulation activation, which demonstrates the necessity for specific testing.",M2
20173029,"The anti-inflammatory actions of <e>platelet</e> endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 do not involve regulation of endothelial cell NF-kappa B.PECAM-1 is a cell adhesion and signaling receptor that is expressed on many hematopoietic cells and at endothelial cell-cell junctions. Accumulating evidence from a number of in vitro and in vivo model systems suggests that PECAM-1 suppresses cytokine production and vascular permeability induced by a wide range of inflammatory stimuli. In several of these models of inflammatory disease, endothelial, and not leukocyte or platelet, PECAM-1 conferred protection against inflammatory insult. However, the mechanism by which endothelial PECAM-1 functions as an anti-inflammatory protein is poorly understood. It was recently suggested that PECAM-1 exerts its anti-inflammatory effects in endothelial cells by inhibiting the activity of NF-kappaB, a proinflammatory transcription factor. To confirm and extend these observations, we examined the effect of engaging, cross-linking, or expressing PECAM-1 on NF-kappaB activation in a variety of human cells. PECAM-1 had no effect on the phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB inhibitory protein, IkappaBalpha; on the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB; on the suppression of cytokine-induced transcriptional activation of an NF-kappaB luciferase reporter plasmid; or on the cytokine-stimulated upregulation of ICAM-1, an NF-kappaB target gene, in endothelial cells. Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that the anti-inflammatory actions of PECAM-1 in endothelial cells are not likely to involve its regulation of NF-kappaB.",M2
20172594,"Calmodulin antagonists induce <e>platelet</e> apoptosis.Calmodulin (CaM) antagonists induce apoptosis in various tumor models and inhibit tumor cell invasion and metastasis, thus some of which have been extensively used as anti-cancer agents. In platelets, CaM has been found to bind directly to the cytoplasmic domains of several platelet receptors. Incubation of platelets with CaM antagonists impairs the receptors-related platelet functions. However, it is still unknown whether CaM antagonists induce platelet apoptosis. Here we show that CaM antagonists N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide (W7), tamoxifen (TMX), and trifluoperazine (TFP) induce apoptotic events in human platelets, including depolarization of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, caspase-3 activation, and phosphatidylserine exposure. CaM antagonists did not incur platelet activation as detected by P-selectin surface expression and PAC-1 binding. However, ADP-, botrocetin-, and alpha-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, platelet adhesion and spreading on von Willebrand factor surface were significantly reduced in platelets pre-treated with CaM antagonists. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca(2+) levels were obviously elevated by both W7 and TMX, and membrane-permeable Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM significantly reduced apoptotic events in platelets induced by W7. Therefore, these findings indicate that CaM antagonists induce platelet apoptosis. The elevation of the cytosolic Ca(2+) levels may be involved in the regulation of CaM antagonists-induced platelet apoptosis.",M2
20170696,"Impaired Na+-dependent glutamate uptake in <e>platelets</e> during depolarization of their plasma membrane.Blood platelets contain neuronal Na(+)-dependent glutamate transporters and are able to accomplish glutamate uptake. Applying high-KCl, we have demonstrated dose-dependent depolarization of the plasma membrane of rabbit platelets that was registered as an increase in the fluorescence of the potential-sensitive fluorescent dye rhodamine 6G. The initial velocity of L-[(14)C]glutamate uptake (10 microM) in platelets was decreased by 20% during 35 mM KCl-evoked depolarization and consisted of 1.2+/-0.09 pmol x min(-1) x mg(-1) protein in control and 0.96+/-0.08 pmol x min(-1) x mg(-1) protein during depolarization. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry revealed that these changes in glutamate uptake were not a result of platelet aggregation/activation. Also, addition of high-KCl did not change acidification of platelet secretory granules that was found with pH-sensitive fluorescent dye acridine orange, thereby showing that changes in their proton gradient could not cause glutamate uptake alteration. This malfunction of glutamate transporters has to take place under: (i) the conditions of pseudohyperkalemia or hyperkalemia, i.e. activation and clotting of platelets, haemolysis, leucocytosis, acute renal failure, hypofunction of adrenal cortex, lack of aldosterone, stroke, trauma and (ii) depolarization of the plasma membrane of platelets during their activation by ADP, thrombin, platelet-activating factor. Weak glutamate uptake might have considerable consequences for platelets per se (and thus for haemostatic system) and glutamate homeostasis in the CNS.",M2
20169928,"Thrombocytopenia as a characteristic trait in the Polish ogar dog.The study was undertaken to ascertain if the normal thrombocyte count in Polish ogar dog differs from normal values in other dog breeds.

20164177,"Nerve growth factor inhibits metalloproteinase-disintegrins and blocks ectodomain shedding of <e>platelet</e> glycoprotein VI.Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays an important role in regulating mammalian neuronal/embryonic development, angiogenesis, and other physiological processes and has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for the neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer disease. In this study, we provide evidence that human NGF may also function as a metalloproteinase inhibitor, based on studies of NGF from snake venom. Originally, our aim was to isolate snake venom metalloproteinases targeting platelet receptors and/or ligands relevant to hemostasis and thrombosis, using Ni(2+)-agarose as a purification step based on the conserved metal ion-coordination motif in venom metalloproteinases. However, subsequent analysis of cobra (Naja kaouthia) venom led to the unexpected discovery that cobra venom NGF bound to Ni(2+)-agarose, eluting at approximately 15 mm imidazole, enabling a one-step purification. The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequence analysis. Partial co-purification of NGF within metalloproteinase-enriched venom fractions led us to test whether NGF affected metalloproteinase activity. Venom NGF potently inhibited metalloproteinases isolated from the same or different venom and specifically bound to purified Nk metalloproteinase immobilized on agarose beads. Human NGF also interacted with human metalloproteinases because it blocked metalloproteinase-mediated shedding of the platelet collagen receptor, glycoprotein (GP)VI, and associated with recombinant ADAM10 by surface plasmon resonance. Together, these results suggest that NGF can function as a metalloproteinase inhibitor.",M2
20162727,"CXC chemokine ligand 4 (Cxcl4) is a <e>platelet</e>-derived mediator of experimental liver fibrosis.Liver fibrosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Platelets are involved in liver damage, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigate the platelet-derived chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 4 (CXCL4) as a molecular mediator of fibrotic liver damage. Serum concentrations and intrahepatic messenger RNA of CXCL4 were measured in patients with chronic liver diseases and mice after toxic liver injury. Platelet aggregation in early fibrosis was determined by electron microscopy in patients and by immunohistochemistry in mice. Cxcl4(-/-) and wild-type mice were subjected to two models of chronic liver injury (CCl(4) and thioacetamide). The fibrotic phenotype was analyzed by histological, biochemical, and molecular analyses. Intrahepatic infiltration of immune cells was investigated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and stellate cells were stimulated with recombinant Cxcl4 in vitro. The results showed that patients with advanced hepatitis C virus-induced fibrosis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis had increased serum levels and intrahepatic CXCL4 messenger RNA concentrations. Platelets were found directly adjacent to collagen fibrils. The CCl(4) and thioacetamide treatment led to an increase of hepatic Cxcl4 levels, platelet activation, and aggregation in early fibrosis in mice. Accordingly, genetic deletion of Cxcl4 in mice significantly reduced histological and biochemical liver damage in vivo, which was accompanied by changes in the expression of fibrosis-related genes (Timp-1 [tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1], Mmp9 [matrix metalloproteinase 9], Tgf-beta [transforming growth factor beta], IL10 [interleukin 10]). Functionally, Cxcl4(-/-) mice showed a strongly decreased infiltration of neutrophils (Ly6G) and CD8(+) T cells into the liver. In vitro, recombinant murine Cxcl4 stimulated the proliferation, chemotaxis, and chemokine expression of hepatic stellate cells. Conclusion: The results underscore an important role of platelets in chronic liver damage and imply a new target for antifibrotic therapies.",M2
20158688,"Supernates from stored red blood cells inhibit <e>platelet</e> aggregation.BACKGROUND: Previously, we reported that red blood cells (RBCs) stored in AS-5 accumulated proinflammatory substances during storage. We observed in those studies that supernates from nonleukoreduced (NLR) RBCs reduced mean anti-CD41a-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) fluorescence on platelets (PLTs), indicative of decreased expression of glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa on the PLT membrane. The objective of this study was to determine if supernates from stored RBCs impaired PLT aggregation as a consequence of reduction in GPIIb/IIIa expression. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Leukoreduced (LR) and NLR RBC units were prepared in AS-5 and stored at 1 to 6 degrees C for 6 weeks. Supernates from RBC samples collected every 2 weeks were mixed with freshly collected type-matched blood and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C. PLTs in each incubated blood sample were evaluated for GPIIb/IIIa expression by flow cytometry and for aggregation response to collagen by whole blood aggregometry. RESULTS: Supernates from stored NLR RBCs reduced CD41a-FITC fluorescence on PLTs by 15% to 31%. A reduction in fluorescence was induced by supernates of RBCs stored for 14 days and increased as storage time increased. Supernates from Day 42 NLR RBCs reduced the mean amplitude of PLT aggregation by 31% compared to Day 0 supernates and lengthened the time before onset of aggregation by 21%. In addition, amplitude correlated directly and lag time correlated inversely with CD41a-FITC fluorescence in all samples. Supernates from prestorage LR RBCs did not affect PLT CD41a-FITC fluorescence or aggregation response.

Here, we demonstrate using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin treatment that CLEC-2 translocates to lipid rafts upon ligand engagement and that translocation is essential for hemITAM phosphorylation and signal initiation. HemITAM phosphorylation, but not translocation, is also critically dependent on actin polymerization, Rac1 activation, and release of ADP and thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)). The role of ADP and TxA(2) in mediating phosphorylation is dependent on ligand engagement and rac activation but is independent of platelet aggregation. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of the GPVI-FcRgamma-chain ITAM, which has 2 YxxL motifs, is independent of actin polymerization and secondary mediators. These results reveal a unique series of proximal events in CLEC-2 phosphorylation involving actin polymerization, secondary mediators, and Rac activation.",M2
20153859,"Variability of residual <e>platelet</e> function despite clopidogrel treatment in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.Residual platelet function despite treatment with clopidogrel may predict an unfavourable cardiovascular outcome. The majority of studies have investigated the effects of clopidogrel administration in conjunction with aspirin in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The primary objective of the present study was to assess the platelet response to clopidogrel in the absence of aspirin in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and to investigate whether non-responsiveness to clopidogrel is reproducible during long-term follow-up. Fifty-four clinically stable PAOD patients on a maintenance dose of 75 mg/d clopidogrel were enrolled in this study. Platelet function was assessed at baseline and after a median follow-up of 18 months using light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) with 2 microM ADP as an agonist. HPLC-coupled mass spectrometry was used to detect clopidogrel and clopidogrel carboxylic acid, the main metabolite of clopidogrel. Residual platelet function, as defined by late aggregation values within the reference range (i.e., &gt;43%), was observed in 35.2% of patients at baseline and 17.6% during follow-up. During the observation period, 26.5% had switched from responder to non-responder status or vice versa. Among non-responders, either clopidogrel or its metabolite was detected in 89.5% and 83.3% of patients at baseline and at follow-up, respectively. We conclude that non-responsiveness to clopidogrel as determined by ADP-induced LTA is not stable over time. This phenomenon cannot be attributed to non-compliance alone.",M2
20152547,"Antiplatelet agents in acute coronary syndromes.The <e>platelet</e> plays an essential role in atherothrombosis. Clinically, platelet-rich thrombi underlie acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). Current therapies have improved outcomes, however, often at the expense of increased risk of bleeding. With the increase in our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of ACSs, newer targets for antiplatelet therapies continue to emerge. Novel antiplatelet agents may provide even greater reductions in ischemic events with the potential for less bleeding. This article reviews the evidence for current antiplatelet agents in ACSs as well as for the newer agents in later phases of clinical testing.",M2

20149696,"A combination graft of low-molecular-weight silk fibroin with Choukroun <e>platelet</e>-rich fibrin for rabbit calvarial defect.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the capabilities of silk fibroin as a biomaterial template for bone formation when mixed with Choukroun platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) in vivo. STUDY DESIGN: Ten New Zealand white rabbits were used for this study and bilateral round shaped defects were formed in the parietal bone (diameter 9.0 mm). The silk fibroin was digested by acid and made into powder (molecular weight &lt;1.0 kDa). The right side (experimental group) received the silk fibroin plus platelet-rich fibroin and the left side (control group) did not receive a graft. Animals were killed at 6 weeks and 12 weeks. The specimens were examined by microscopic computerized tomography (micro-CT). Subsequently, they underwent decalcification and were stained for histologic analysis. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups at 6 weeks after operation. In the micro-CT results, however, tissue mineral content in the experimental group at 12 weeks after operation was 132.09 +/- 4.41 and that in the control group was 126.42 +/- 6.62 (P = .011). Tissue mineral density in the experimental group was 2,088.88 +/- 648.34, and that in the control group was 2,029.72 +/- 668.22 (P = .013). The results of the histomorphometric analysis were in accordance with the micro-CT results. The total new bone was 49.86 +/- 7.49% in the control group at 12 weeks after the operation and 59.83 +/- 10.92% in the experimental group (P = .021). CONCLUSION: A combined application of Choukroun PRF with acid-digested silk fibroin showed more rapid bone healing than unfilled control.",M2
20149436,"Screening <e>platelet</e>-surface interactions using negative surface charge gradients.Negative surface charge density gradients were prepared on fused silica slides using selective oxidation of a 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MTS) monolayer converting surface thiol groups (-SH) into negatively charged sulfonate (-SO(3)(-)) groups. The sulfonate-to-thiol gradient samples were characterized by water contact angle and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). Gradients were pre-adsorbed with proteins from three different solutions: platelet free plasma (PFP), fibrinogen, or albumin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Washed platelets were perfused over gradient samples in a parallel plate flow chamber and platelet adhesion was measured across the gradients using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Gradients pre-adsorbed with PFP showed adhesion contrast inversely related to the negative surface charge density. The magnitude of the adhesion contrast along the gradient was also dependent on PFP concentration. Gradients pre-adsorbed with fibrinogen showed an adhesion maximum in the center of the gradient region. Albumin coating of the gradients resulted in low overall platelet adhesion with increased adhesion in regions of high negative charge density. The effect of gradient orientation with respect to the flow was also investigated. Gradients pre-adsorbed with 10% PFP showed different adhesion contrast when the platelets were perfused in opposite directions. This suggests that platelet adhesion is, in addition to responding to the local surface properties, also dependent on the upstream conditions.",M2
20148891,"A structural basis for the inhibition of collagen-stimulated <e>platelet</e> function by quercetin and structurally related flavonoids.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Molecular mechanisms underlying the links between dietary intake of flavonoids and reduced cardiovascular disease risk are only partially understood. Key events in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, particularly thrombosis, are inhibited by these polyphenolic compounds via mechanisms such as inhibition of platelet activation and associated signal transduction, attenuation of generation of reactive oxygen species, enhancement of nitric oxide production and binding to thromboxane A(2) receptors. In vivo, effects of flavonoids are mediated by their metabolites, but the effects and modes of action of these compounds are not well-characterized. A good understanding of flavonoid structure-activity relationships with regard to platelet function is also lacking. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Inhibitory potencies of structurally distinct flavonoids (quercetin, apigenin and catechin) and plasma metabolites (tamarixetin, quercetin-3'-sulphate and quercetin-3-glucuronide) for collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation and 5-hydroxytryptamine secretion were measured in human platelets. Tyrosine phosphorylation of total protein, Syk and PLCgamma2 (immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses), and Fyn kinase activity were also measured in platelets. Internalization of flavonoids and metabolites in a megakaryocytic cell line (MEG-01 cells) was studied by fluorescence confocal microscopy. Key results: The inhibitory mechanisms of these compounds included blocking Fyn kinase activity and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLCgamma2 following internalization. Principal functional groups attributed to potent inhibition were a planar, C-4 carbonyl substituted and C-3 hydroxylated C ring in addition to a B ring catechol moiety. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The structure-activity relationship for flavonoids on platelet function presented here may be exploited to design selective inhibitors of cell signalling.",M2
20144497,"Scintigraphic evaluation of osteoblastic activity in extraction sockets treated with <e>platelet</e>-rich fibrin.PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) on the early bone healing process with bone scintigraphy based on technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate uptake in third molar extraction sockets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with bilaterally soft tissue impacted third mandibular molars were included in the study. The right and left impacted third molars were surgically extracted in the same session. PRF was randomly administered into one of the extraction sockets, whereas the contralateral sockets were left without treatment. Four weeks after surgery, scintigrams were obtained to evaluate scintigraphic differences between PRF-treated and non-PRF-treated sockets. After completion of the clinical study, PRF samples were evaluated by light and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The average increase in technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate uptake as an indication of enhanced bone healing did not differ significantly between PRF-treated and non-PRF-treated sockets 4 weeks postoperatively (P &gt; .05). Abundant fibrin and inflammatory cells were observed by light microscopic examination of PRF samples. Scanning electron microscopic analysis of PRF revealed the existence of platelet aggregates in a fibrin network and crystalline particles on the outer surface of PRF. CONCLUSIONS: PRF might not lead to enhanced bone healing in soft tissue impacted mandibular third molar extraction sockets 4 weeks after surgery. PRF exhibits the potential characteristics of an autologous fibrin matrix. However, whether the presence of crystal-like particles on the outer surface of PRF alters bone healing should be investigated further.",M2
20142119,"Clopidogrel response: head-to-head comparison of different <e>platelet</e> assays to identify clopidogrel non responder patients after coronary stenting.OBJECTIVES: We investigated the agreement between different platelet tests to identify clopidogrel non response. BACKGROUND: Biological definition of clopidogrel non response remains controversial. Different platelet tests have been linked with recurrent ischemic events and proposed for daily practice. METHODS: We prospectively investigated the agreement of platelet tests to isolate clopidogrel non response in patients receiving high 150 mg clopidogrel maintenance dose after coronary stenting. Clopidogrel response was assessed with ADP-induced aggregation (ADP-Ag) (non response if &gt;70%), Platelet reactivity index VASP (PRI VASP) (non response if &gt;50%) and Verify Now Point-of-care assay (VN) (non response if PRU &gt; 240 AU). RESULTS: Seventy consecutive patients were included. The rates of non-responders were respectively: 13% (n = 9) with the ADP-Ag, 39% (n = 27) with the PRI VASP and 33% (n = 23) with the VN. We observed significant correlation between different platelet tests assessing clopidogrel response: r = 0.55 (p &lt; 0.0001) for ADP-Ag and PRI VASP, r = 0.64 (p &lt; 0.0001) for ADP-Ag and VN and r = 0.59 (p &lt; 0.0001) for PRI VASP and VN. However, using the most common thresholds, the agreement between the difference tests was poor: 0.35 for ADP-Ag and PRI VASP, 0.36 for ADP-Ag and VN and 0.46 for PRI VASP and VN. CONCLUSION: This study showed that assessment of platelet function inhibition by clopidogrel is highly test-specific. Indeed, our results demonstrated a poor agreement between different platelet assays and suggested that identification of clopidogrel non responders is test-dependent.",M2
20139897,"Repurposing an old drug for a new use: glybenclamide exerts antiplatelet activity by interacting with the thromboxane A(2) receptor.AIM: To investigate the potential antagonistic activity of the antidiabetic agent glybenclamide for the human <e>platelet</e> thromboxane A(2) receptor (abbreviated as TPR). METHODS: Platelets were obtained from healthy donors. Aggregation studies were performed in a model 700 aggregometry system. Radioactivity was counted in a Beckman LS 6000 liquid scintillation counter and calcium imaging was performed using an LS50B PerkinElmer Fluorescence Spectrometer. RESULTS: It was found that glybenclamide: 1) inhibited aggregation induced by the TPR agonist U46619 (IC(50)=2.3+/-0.31 micromol/L) and by the thromboxane A(2) precursor arachidonic acid (IC(50)=2.6+/-0.24 micromol/L); 2) displaced SQ29,548 from its binding sites on platelets; 3) lacked any detectable effects on aggregation stimulated by ADP, or the thrombin receptor activating-peptide 4; 4) blocked calcium mobilization induced by U46619, but not by ADP; and 5) failed to raise cAMP levels. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that glybenclamide exerts inhibitory effects on platelets by interacting with TPR. Thus, glybenclamide or a rationally designed derivative has the potential to serve as an antithrombotic agent.",M2
20139362,"Magnetic resonance molecular imaging of thrombosis in an arachidonic acid mouse model using an activated <e>platelet</e> targeted probe.OBJECTIVE: Atherosclerotic plaque rupture leads to acute thrombus formation and may trigger serious clinical events such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Therefore, it would be valuable to identify atherothrombosis and vulnerable plaques before the onset of such clinical events. We sought to determine whether the noninvasive in vivo visualization of activated platelets was effective when using a target-specific MRI contrast agent to identify thrombi, hallmarks of vulnerable or high-risk atherosclerotic plaques. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inflammatory thrombi were induced in mice via topical application of arachidonic acid on the carotid. Thrombus formation was imaged with intravital fluorescence microscopy and molecular MRI. To accomplish the latter, a paramagnetic contrast agent (P975) that targets the glycoprotein alpha(IIb)beta(3), expressed on activated platelets, was investigated. The specificity of P975 for activated platelets was studied in vitro. In vivo, high spatial-resolution MRI was performed at baseline and longitudinally over 2 hours after injecting P975 or a nonspecific agent. The contralateral carotid, a sham surgery group, and a competitive inhibition experiment served as controls. P975 showed a good affinity for activated platelets, with an IC(50) (concentration of dose that produces 50% inhibition) value of 2.6 micromol/L. In thrombosed animals, P975 produced an immediate and sustained increase in MRI signal, whereas none of the control groups revealed any significant increase in MRI signal 2 hours after injection. More important, the competitive inhibition experiment with an alpha(IIb)beta(3) antagonist suppressed the MRI signal enhancement, which is indicative for the specificity of P975 for the activated platelets. CONCLUSIONS: P975 allowed in vivo target-specific noninvasive MRI of activated platelets.",M2
20148881,"Actin filaments and microtubule dual-granule transport in human adhered <e>platelets</e>: the role of alpha-dystrobrevins.Upon activation with physiological stimuli, human platelets undergo morphological changes, centralizing their organelles and secreting effector molecules at the site of vascular injury. Previous studies have indicated that the actin filaments and microtubules of suspension-activated platelets play a critical role in granule movement and exocytosis; however, the participation of these cytoskeleton elements in adhered platelets remains unexplored. alpha- and beta-dystrobrevin members of the dystrophin-associated protein complex in muscle and non-muscle cells have been described as motor protein receptors that might participate in the transport of cellular components in neurons. Recently, we characterized the expression of dystrobrevins in platelets; however, their functional diversity within this cellular model had not been elucidated. The present study examined the contribution of actin filaments and microtubules in granule trafficking during the platelet adhesion process using cytoskeleton-disrupting drugs, quantification of soluble P-selectin, fluorescence resonance transfer energy analysis and immunoprecipitation assays. Likewise, we assessed the interaction of alpha-dystrobrevins with the ubiquitous kinesin heavy chain. Our results strongly suggest that microtubules and actin filaments participate in the transport of alpha and dense granules in the platelet adhesion process, during which alpha-dystrobrevins play the role of regulatory and adaptor proteins that govern trafficking events.",M2
20147473,"Rapid cellular enrichment of eicosapentaenoate after a single intravenous injection of a novel medium-chain triacylglycerol:fish-oil emulsion in humans.BACKGROUND: Dietary deficiency in n-3 (omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) prevails in Western populations and potentially results in adverse health outcomes. To circumvent the slow n-3 PUFA incorporation in phospholipids of key cells after oral supplementation, a new preparation for intravenous bolus injection was developed with 20 g triacylglycerols/100 mL of a mixture of 80% medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs) and 20% fish oil (FO) (wt:wt), and 0.4 g alpha-tocopherol/100 mL of the same mixture. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to document the enrichment of n-3 PUFAs in leukocyte and <e>platelet</e> phospholipids after a bolus intravenous injection of MCT:FO in men. DESIGN: Twelve healthy male subjects received injections over a 5-min period of 50 mL of either MCT:FO or a control MCT:long-chain triacylglycerol (MCT:LCT) emulsion containing 20 g triacylglycerols/100 mL with equal amounts (wt:wt) of MCT and soybean triacylglycerols (LCT) and containing 0.02 g alpha-tocopherol/100 mL; after an 8-wk interval, the subjects received injections of the other preparation. RESULTS: Clinical and biological variables that assessed tolerance and safety remained unchanged. Plasma elimination was faster for MCT:FO than for MCT:LCT (half-life: 24.5 +/- 3.5 min compared with 32.9 +/- 3.0 min; P &lt; 0.025). This was associated with a greater increase in the plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentration. The content of n-3 PUFAs, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), increased in leukocyte and platelet phospholipids within 60 min and &gt; or =24 h after MCT:FO injection. CONCLUSION: Bolus intravenous injection of a novel MCT:FO emulsion allows rapid enrichment of cells with n-3 PUFAs.",M2
