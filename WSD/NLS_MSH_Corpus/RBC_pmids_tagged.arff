20509331,"Advanced oxidation protein products and total antioxidant activity in colorectal carcinoma.The present study was designed to assess the levels of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and percent hemolysis (that indirectly indicates the degree of membrane damage secondary to lipid peroxidation) in colorectal carcinoma. Glutathione (GSH), total thiols and albumin were measured to determine the antioxidant status. Considering the dynamic interaction between various antioxidants in the body, we measured the total antioxidant activity (AOA). Globulin was measured to assess the inflammatory response secondary to oxidative stress. Investigations were conducted in 45 cases of recently diagnosed primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. As control, 45 age and sex matched healthy persons were chosen. GSH was estimated in whole blood, percent hemolysis in <e>RBC</e> suspension and other parameters in plasma. We observed a very high significant increase (P&lt;0.001) in AOPP, percent hemolysis and a highly significant increase (P&lt;0.01) in globulin in colorectal carcinoma. We observed a very high significant decrease (P&lt;0.001) in whole blood GSH, total thiols, albumin, AOA and a significant decrease (P&lt;0.05) in plasma GSH in colorectal carcinoma. A very high significant negative correlation between percent hemolysis and AOA and an apparent negative correlation between total thiols and AOPP was seen in colorectal carcinoma. This demonstrated oxidative stress, decreased antioxidant status and secondary inflammatory response in colorectal carcinoma.",M1
20499836,"Blood compatibility of polyamidoamine dendrimers and erythrocyte protection.Dendrimers are global macromolecules with promising biomedical application. In order to investigate their blood compatibility, different generations of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers terminated with different types of surface functional groups were incubated with red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>) for time course of haemolysis assay and RBC morphology observation. Cationic PAMAM dendrimers demonstrated obvious generation, concentration and time dependent haemolysis while anionic and neutral PAMAM dendrimers were much less hemolytic. The surface amino groups and the polymeric structure of cationic PAMAM dendrimers played pivotal roles in haemolysis induction; meanwhile the basic pH of cationic PAMAM solutions was an inneglectable factor. Due to the presence of plasma proteins in abundance, whole blood was found tolerable to haemolysis induced by dendrimers, possibly through complex formation of plasma proteins with cationic PAMAM dendrimers. It was deduced that poly-carboxylic acids may have the similar effect as that of plasma proteins. So by means of pH adjustment to the physical 7.4, reduction of administration dose and the combined use of plasma protein (or other protective additives such as negatively charged molecules), the blood compatibility and even biocompatibility of cationic dendrimers may be enhanced to  safe  level.",M1
20489133,"Monitoring of biochemical status in children with Duarte galactosemia: utility of galactose, galactitol, galactonate, and galactose 1-phosphate.BACKGROUND: Duarte galactosemia (DG) is frequently detected in newborn-screening programs. DG patients do not manifest the symptoms of classic galactosemia, but whether they require dietary galactose restriction is controversial. We sought to assess the relationships of selected galactose metabolites (plasma galactose, plasma galactitol, erythrocyte (<e>RBC</e>) galactitol, RBC galactonate, and urine galactitol and galactonate) to RBC galactose 1-phosphate (Gal-1-P), dietary galactose intake, and neurodevelopmental/clinical outcomes in DG children. METHODS: We studied 30 children 1-6 years of age who had DG galactosemia and were on a regular diet. All participants underwent a physical and ophthalmologic examination and a neurodevelopmental assessment. RBC galactitol, RBC galactonate, RBC Gal-1-P, plasma galactose, plasma galactonate, and urine galactitol and galactonate concentrations were measured. RESULTS: RBC galactitol and galactonate concentrations were about 2 and 6 times higher, respectively, than control values. Plasma galactose and galactitol concentrations were also about twice the control values. The mean values for RBC Gal-1-P and urine galactitol were within the reference interval. We found a relationship between plasma and urine galactitol concentrations but no relationship between RBC galactose metabolites and urine galactitol. There was a significant relationship between galactose intake and RBC galactose metabolites, especially RBC galactitol (P &lt; 0.0005) and RBC galactonate (P &lt; 0.0005). Galactose intake was not related to the urine galactitol, plasma galactose, or plasma galactitol concentration. RBC galactitol, RBC galactonate, plasma galactose, plasma galactitol, and urine galactonate concentrations showed no relationship with clinical or developmental outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: DG children on a regular diet have RBC Gal-1-P concentrations within the reference interval but increased concentrations of other galactose metabolites, including RBC galactitol and RBC galactonate. These increased concentrations correlate with galactose intake and neither cause any developmental or clinical pathology during early childhood nor oblige a lactose-restricted diet.",M1
20462428,"Chronic and acute effects of walnuts on antioxidant capacity and nutritional status in humans: a randomized, cross-over pilot study.BACKGROUND: Compared with other common plant foods, walnuts (Juglans regia) are consistently ranked among the highest in antioxidant capacity. In vitro, walnut polyphenols inhibit plasma and LDL oxidation, while in animal models they lower biomarkers of oxidative stress and raise antioxidant capacity. A limited number of human feeding trials indicate that walnuts improve some measures of antioxidant status, but not others. METHODS: A 19 wk, randomized crossover trial was conducted in 21 generally healthy men and postmenopausal women &gt; or = 50 y to study the dose-response effects of walnut intake on biomarkers of antioxidant activity, oxidative stress, and nutrient status. Subjects were randomized to receive either 21 or 42 g raw walnuts/d during each 6 wk intervention phase with a 6 wk washout between phases. Subjects were instructed to consume their usual diet, but refrain from eating any other tree nuts, seeds, peanuts, or ellagitannin-rich foods during the entire study, and other polyphenol-rich foods for 2 d prior to each study visit. RESULTS: Compared to baseline levels, red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) linoleic acid and plasma pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) were significantly higher after 6 wk with 42 g/d walnuts (P &lt; 0.05 for both). Overall, changes in plasma total thiols, and other antioxidant biomarkers, were not significant with either walnut dose. However, when compared to fasting levels, plasma total thiols were elevated within 1 h of walnut consumption with both doses during the baseline and end visits for each intervention phase (P &lt; 0.05 for all). Despite the observed increase in RBC linoleic and linolenic acids associated with walnut consumption, this substrate for lipid peroxidation only minimally affected malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant capacity. The proportional changes in MDA and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) were consistent with a dose-response effect, although no significant within- or between-group differences were observed for these measures. CONCLUSIONS: Walnut consumption did not significantly change the plasma antioxidant capacity of healthy, well-nourished older adults in this pilot study. However, improvements in linoleic acid and pyridoxal phosphate were observed with chronic consumption, while total plasma thiols were enhanced acutely. Future studies investigating the antioxidant effects of walnuts in humans are warranted, but should include either a larger sample size or a controlled feeding intervention.

20450877,"High fat diets modulate nitric oxide biosynthesis and antioxidant defence in red blood cells from C57BL/6 mice.The consumption of a high fat (HF) diet is considered a risk factor for the development of obesity. On the other hand, a monounsaturated HF diet has beneficial cardiometabolic effects. Since nitric oxide (NO) modulates vascular homeostasis, we investigate whether HF diets that vary in fatty acid composition have a different effect on theL-arginine-NO pathway and oxidative stress in C57BL/6 mice red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>). The olive oil diet induced an activation of L-arginine transport compared to other diets. NO synthase (NOS) activity was increased in all unsaturated HF diets (olive, sunflower and canola oils). Moreover, the expression of endothelial NOS (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) was increased in the olive oil group. In contrast, NOS activity from the lard group was decreased associated with diminished l-arginine transport. Olive oil also induced superoxide dismutase activation. Inhibition of the L-arginine-NO pathway in the lard group could contribute to cardiovascular diseases, while unsaturated HF diets may have a protector effect via enhanced NO bioavailability.",M1
20435199,"Red blood cell storage duration and mortality in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion has been associated with an increased mortality in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Although the reasons for this remain unclear, it may be related to the structural and functional changes occurring within red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) during storage. We investigated whether RBC storage duration was associated with mortality in patients requiring transfusion after PCI. METHODS: We collected data on all RBC transfusions occurring within 10 days of PCI (excluding those related to cardiac surgery) using the British Columbia Cardiac Registry and Central Transfusion Registry. Transfusion details were analyzed according to 30-day survival. RESULTS: From a total of 32,580 patients undergoing PCI, 909 (2.8%) patients received RBCs with a mean storage duration of 25 +/- 10 days. In these 909 patients, mean transfusion volumes were lower in survivors (2.8 +/- 2.1 vs 3.8 +/- 2.9 U, P = .002) than those who died within 30 days. In a multivariate analysis to adjust for baseline risk, mean RBC storage age (HR 1.02 [95% CI 1.01-1.04], P = .002) and transfusion volume (HR 1.26 [95% CI 1.18-1.34], P &lt; .001) both predicted 30-day mortality. Transfused patients who received only older blood (RBC min age &gt;28 days) appeared to be at greater risk of death (HR 2.49 [95% CI 1.45-4.25], P = .001). CONCLUSION: Red blood cell transfusion is associated with increased 30-day mortality in patients undergoing PCI. Although current transfusion practice permits RBC storage for up to 42 days, the use of older red cells may pose an additional hazard to this patient group.",M1
20430017,"Effect of thiol drugs on tert-butyl hydroperoxide induced luminol chemiluminescence in human erythrocytes, erythrocyte lysate, and erythrocyte membranes.The paper investigates the effect of thiol drugs (RSH) under oxidative stress condition using luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence technique. The examinations included N-acetylcysteine (NAC), N-acetylpenicillamine (NAP), penicillamine (PEN), mesna (MES), and tiopronin (TPR). The model systems contained isolated human erythrocytes (<e>RBC</e>), erythrocyte lysates (LYS) or erythrocyte membranes (MEM) exposed to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH). Under the influence of RSH, a bimodal character of some experimental chemiluminescence curves was observed and the kinetic solution was considered as the sum of two logistic-exponential processes. These chemiluminescence changes probably reflected two connected processes--scavenging by RSH of the t-BuOOH-induced free radicals and simultaneous generation of thiol-derived secondary free radicals. Individual differences in thiols interaction showed a multivariate set of the kinetic curve descriptors. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) well distinguished subsets of RSH influence in systems with RBC or LYS. Generally, the action of NAC was exclusively pro-oxidant in both systems, with RBC and LYS. The behaviour of MES or NAP in these systems was also pro-oxidant but many times less prominent than NAC. Under the influence of TPR a dramatic switch in the anti-oxidant effect was observed in system with RBC to very pro-oxidant effect in LYS. The influence of PEN was analogical to TPR but very weak. This experimental model together with kinetic solution of the unique bimodal chemiluminescence curves, and PCA, supply new insights to the dual (anti- and pro-oxidant) effects of thiol drugs under oxidative stress condition.",M1
20415140,"Biochemical changes of hemoglobin and osmotic fragility of red blood cells in high fat diet rabbits.The aim of this study was to assess the effects of hyperlipidemia on auto-oxidation rate of hemoglobin (Hb; absorbance at 630 nm versus time), Hb derivatives and osmotic fragility of Red Blood Cells (<e>RBCs</e>). These parameters were measured in twenty five 12-week-old male New Zealand white rabbits fed on a High Fat Diet (HFD) for a feeding period of 10 weeks. We found that Hb concentration and RBC count were significantly decreased while white blood cell and platelet counts were significantly increased in HFD rabbits compared with control rabbits. The Total Cholesterol (TC) was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01) in HFD rabbits compared with control rabbits with percentage normalized change of 1198% and Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDLC) significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01) in HFD rabbits compared with control rabbits with percentage normalized change of 1591%. In HFD rabbits, oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) percentage was significantly decreased while met-hemoglobin (Met-Hb) percentage was significantly increased compared with control rabbits. The auto-oxidation rate was significantly higher in HFD rabbits compared with controls. Hyperlipidemia induced an increase in the osmotic fragility of RBCs and a decrease in their membrane elasticity compared with controls. This study suggests that hyperlipidemia may produce reactive oxygen species and other free radicals which increase the auto-oxidation rate of Hb and promote the conversion of HbO2 and the fractions of unstable Hb molecules to Met-Hb and carboxyhemoglobin. Increased platelet activation in hyperlipidemic rabbits may be of pathophysiological importance for the progression of atherosclerosis and thromboembolic complications. The increase in osmotic fragility of RBCs may be attributed to the disturbance of ionic motion through the membrane and the change in molecular properties of the membrane macromolecules.",M1
20411955,"Conserved high activity binding peptides are involved in adhesion of two detergent-resistant membrane-associated merozoite proteins to red blood cells during invasion.Detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites contain a large number of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins that have been implicated in interactions between merozoites and red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>). In this study, two cysteine-rich proteins anchored by GPI to merozoite DRMs (Pf92 and Pf113) were studied with the aim of identifying regions actively involved in RBC invasion. By means of binding assays, high-activity binding peptides (HABPs) with a large number of binding sites per RBC were identified in Pf92 and Pf113. The nature of the RBC surface receptors for these HABPs was explored using enzyme-treated RBCs and cross-linking assays. Invasion inhibition and immunofluorescence localization studies suggest that Pf92 and Pf113 are involved in RBC invasion and that their adhesion to RBCs is mediated by such HABPs. Additionally, polymorphism and circular dichroism studies support their inclusion in further studies to design components of an antimalarial vaccine.",M1
20410503,"Sustained thromboprophylaxis mediated by an <e>RBC</e>-targeted pro-urokinase zymogen activated at the site of clot formation.Plasminogen activators (PAs) are used to treat life-threatening thrombosis, but not for thromboprophylaxis because of rapid clearance, risk of bleeding, and central nervous system (CNS) toxicity. We describe a novel strategy that may help to overcome these limitations by targeting a thrombin-activated PA pro-drug to circulating red blood cells (RBCs). We fused a single chain antibody (scFv Ter-119) that binds to mouse glycophorin A (GPA) with a variant human single-chain low molecular weight urokinase construct that can be activated selectively by thrombin (scFv/uPA-T). scFv/uPA-T bound specifically to mouse RBCs without altering their biocompatibility and retained its zymogenic properties until converted by thrombin into an active 2-chain molecule. As a result, RBC-bound scFv/uPA-T caused thrombin-induced fibrinolysis. One hour and 48 hours after intravenous (IV) injection in mice, approximately 70% and approximately 35% of scFv/uPA-T was retained in the blood, respectively, and approximately 95% of the circulating scFv/uPA-T remained bound to RBCs. A single IV injection of scFv/uPA-T provided effective prophylaxis against arterial and venous thrombosis for up to 24 hours. Thus, prophylactic delivery of RBC-targeted PA pro-drugs activated selectively at the site of clot formation represents a new approach to prevent thrombosis in clinical settings where the risk of clotting is high.",M1

20400635,"Use it or lose it? Sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, a species representing a fifth teleostean group where the betaNHE associated with the red blood cell adrenergic stress response has been secondarily lost.Like most teleosts, sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria Pallas 1814) blood exhibits a moderate Root effect (~35% maximal desaturation), where a reduction in blood pH dramatically reduces O(2) carrying capacity, a mechanism important for oxygenating the eye and filling the swim bladder (SB) in teleosts. Although sablefish lack a SB, we observed a well-defined choroid rete at the eye. The adrenergically mediated cell swelling typically associated with a functional red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) beta-adrenergic Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (betaNHE), which would normally protect RBC pH, and thus O(2) transport, during a generalized acidosis, was not observed in sablefish blood. Neither isoproterenol (a beta-agonist) nor 8-bromo cAMP could elicit this response. Furthermore, RBC osmotic shrinkage, known to stimulate NHEs in general and betaNHE in other teleosts such as trout and flounder, resulted in no significant regulatory volume increase (RVI), further supporting the absence of a functional RBC betaNHE. The onset of the Root effect occurs at a much lower RBC pH (6.83-6.92) than in other teleosts, and thus RBC betaNHE may not be required to protect O(2) transport during a generalized acidosis in vivo. Phylogenetically, sablefish may represent a fifth group of teleosts exhibiting a secondary reduction or loss of betaNHE activity. However, sablefish have not lost the choroid rete at the eye (unlike in the other four groups), which may still function with the Root effect to oxygenate the retina, but the low pH onset of the Root effect may ensure haemoglobin (Hb)-O(2) binding is not compromised at the respiratory surface during a general acidosis in the absence of RBC betaNHE. The sablefish may represent an anomaly within the framework of Root effect evolution, in that they possess a moderate Root effect and a choroid rete at the eye, but lack the RBC betaNHE and the SB system.",M1
20389584,"Comparison of the discrete dipole approximation and the discrete source method for simulation of light scattering by red blood cells.The discrete sources method (DSM) and the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) were compared for simulation of light scattering by a red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) model. We considered RBCs with diameters up to 8 mum (size parameter up to 38), relative refractive indices 1.03 and 1.06, and two different orientations. The agreement in the angle-resolved S(11) element of the Mueller matrix obtained by these methods is generally good, but it deteriorates with increasing scattering angle, diameter and refractive index of a RBC. Based on the DDA simulations with very fine discretization (up to 93 dipoles per wavelength) for a single RBC, we attributed most of the disagreement to the DSM, which results contain high-frequency ripples. For a single orientation of a RBC the DDA is comparable to or faster than the DSM. However, the relation is reversed when a set of particle orientations need to be simulated at once. Moreover, the DSM requires about an order of magnitude less computer memory. At present, application of the DSM for massive calculation of light scattering patterns of RBCs is hampered by its limitations in size parameter of a RBC due to the high number of harmonics used for calculations.",M1
20365616,"Polarizability of red blood cells with an anisotropic membrane.We predict the complex polarizability of a realistic model of a red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>), with an inhomogeneous dispersive and anisotropic membrane. In this model, the frequency-dependent complex electrical parameters of the individual cell layers are described by the Debye equation while the dielectric anisotropy of the cell membrane is taken into account by the different permittivities along directions normal and tangential to the membrane surface. The realistic shape of the RBC is described in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions. To calculate the polarizability, we evoke the effective dipole moment method to determine the cell internal electric field distribution, employing an adaptive finite-element numerical approach. We have furthermore investigated the influence of the anisotropic membrane and dispersive electrical parameters of each individual cell layer on the total complex polarizability. Our findings suggest that the individual layer contribution depends on two factors: the volume of the layer and the associated induced electric field, which in turn is influenced by other layers of the cell. These results further show that the average polarizability spectra of the cell are significantly impacted by the anisotropy and associated dispersion of the cellular compartments.",M1
20365402,"Effect of the natural state of an elastic cellular membrane on tank-treading and tumbling motions of a single red blood cell.A two-dimensional computer simulation model was proposed for tank-treading and tumbling motions of an elastic biconcave red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) under steady shear flow. The RBC model consisted of an outer cellular membrane and an inner fluid; the membrane's elastic properties were modeled by springs for stretch/compression and bending to consider the membrane's natural state in a practical manner. Membrane deformation was coupled with incompressible viscous flow of the inner and outer fluids of the RBC using a particle method. The proposed simulation model was capable of reproducing tank-treading and tumbling motions of an RBC along with rotational oscillation, which is the transition between the two motions. In simulations using the same initial RBC shape with different natural states of the RBC membrane, only tank-treading motion was exhibited in the case of a uniform natural state of the membrane, and a nonuniform natural state was necessary to generate the rotational oscillation and tumbling motion. Simulation results corresponded to published data from experimental and computational studies. In the range of simulation parameters considered, the relative membrane elastic force versus fluid viscous force was approximately 1 at the transition when the natural state nonuniformity was taken into account in estimating the membrane elastic force. A combination of natural state nonuniformity and elastic spring constant determined that change in the RBC deformation at the transition is that from a large compressive deformation to no deformation, such as rigid body.",M1
20357243,"The IgG-specific endoglycosidase EndoS inhibits both cellular and complement-mediated autoimmune hemolysis.EndoS from Streptococcus pyogenes is an immunomodulating enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes glycans from human immunoglobulin G and thereby affects antibody effector functions. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is caused by antibody-mediated red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) destruction and often resists treatment with corticosteroids that also cause frequent adverse effects. We show here that anti-RhD (anti-D) and rabbit anti-human-RBC antibodies (anti-RBC) mediated destruction of RBC, ie, phagocytosis, complement activation, and hemolysis in vitro and in vivo was inhibited by EndoS. Phagocytosis by monocytes in vitro was inhibited by pretreatment of anti-D with EndoS before sensitization of RBCs and abrogated by direct addition of EndoS to blood containing sensitized RBCs. The toxic effects of monocytes stimulated with anti-D-sensitized RBCs, as measured by interleukin-8 secretion and oxygen metabolite production, was restrained by EndoS. Agglutination of RBCs and complement-mediated hemolysis in vitro in whole human blood caused by rabbit anti-RBCs was inhibited by EndoS. Development of anemia in mice caused by a murine anti-RBC immunoglobulin G2a monoclonal autoantibody and complement activation and erythrophagocytosis by Kupffer cells in the liver were reduced by EndoS. Our data indicate that EndoS is a potential therapeutic agent that might be evaluated as an alternative to current treatment regimens against antibody-mediated destruction of RBCs.",M1
20357184,"Dysregulation of L-arginine metabolism and bioavailability associated to free plasma heme.Severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria is associated with hypoargininemia, which contributes to impaired systemic and pulmonary nitric oxide (NO) production and endothelial dysfunction. Since intravascular hemolysis is an intrinsic feature of severe malaria, we investigated whether and by which mechanisms free heme [Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX (FP)] might contribute to the dysregulation of L-arginine (L-Arg) metabolism and bioavailability. Carrier systems  y+  [or cationic amino acid transporter (CAT)] and  y+L  transport L-Arg into red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>), where it is hydrolyzed to ornithine and urea by arginase (isoform I) or converted to NO* and citrulline by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Our results show a significant and dose-dependent impairment of L-Arg transport into RBC pretreated with FP, with a strong inhibition of the system carrier y+L. Despite the impaired L-Arg influx, higher amounts of L-Arg-derived urea are produced by RBC preexposed to FP caused by activation of RBC arginase I. This activation appeared not to be mediated by oxidative modifications of the enzyme. We conclude that L-Arg transport across RBC membrane is impaired and arginase-mediated L-Arg consumption enhanced by free heme. This could contribute to reduced NO production in severe malaria.",M1
20351261,"Measurement of red blood cell mechanics during morphological changes.The human red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) membrane, a fluid lipid bilayer tethered to an elastic 2D spectrin network, provides the principal control of the cell's morphology and mechanics. These properties, in turn, influence the ability of RBCs to transport oxygen in circulation. Current mechanical measurements of RBCs rely on external loads. Here we apply a noncontact optical interferometric technique to quantify the thermal fluctuations of RBC membranes with 3 nm accuracy over a broad range of spatial and temporal frequencies. Combining this technique with a new mathematical model describing RBC membrane undulations, we measure the mechanical changes of RBCs as they undergo a transition from the normal discoid shape to the abnormal echinocyte and spherical shapes. These measurements indicate that, coincident with this morphological transition, there is a significant increase in the membrane's shear, area, and bending moduli. This mechanical transition can alter cell circulation and impede oxygen delivery.",M1
20338501,"Red blood cell contamination of the final cell product impairs the efficacy of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell therapy.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify an association between the quality and functional activity of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (BMCs) used for cardiovascular regenerative therapies and contractile recovery in patients with acute myocardial infarction included in the placebo-controlled REPAIR-AMI (Reinfusion of Enriched Progenitor cells And Infarct Remodeling in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial. BACKGROUND: Isolation procedures of autologous BMCs might affect cell functionality and therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: Quality of cell isolation was assessed by measuring the total number of isolated BMCs, CD34+ and CD133+ cells, their colony-forming unit (CFU) and invasion capacity, cell viability, and contamination of the final BMC preparation with thrombocytes and red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>). RESULTS: The number of RBCs contaminating the final cell product significantly correlated with reduced recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction 4 months after BMC therapy (p = 0.007). Higher numbers of RBCs in the BMC preparation were associated with reduced BMC viability (r = -0.23, p = 0.001), CFU capacity (r = -0.16, p = 0.03), and invasion capacity (r = -0.27, p &lt; 0.001). To assess a causal role for RBC contamination, we coincubated isolated BMCs with RBCs for 24 h in vitro. The addition of RBCs dose-dependently abrogated migratory capacity (p = 0.003) and reduced CFU capacity (p &lt; 0.05) of isolated BMCs. Neovascularization capacity was significantly impaired after infusion of BMCs contaminated with RBCs, compared with BMCs alone (p &lt; 0.05). Mechanistically, the addition of RBCs was associated with a profound reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential of BMCs. CONCLUSIONS: Contaminating RBCs affects the functionality of isolated BMCs and determines the extent of left ventricular ejection fraction recovery after intracoronary BMC infusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction. These results suggest a bioactivity response relationship very much like a dose-response relationship in drug trials.

20336519,"Directed differentiation of red blood cells from human embryonic stem cells.Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) represent a new source of stem cells that can be propagated and expanded in vitro indefinitely, providing a potentially inexhaustible and donorless source of cells for human therapy. The ability to create banks of hESC lines with matched or reduced incompatibility could potentially reduce or eliminate the need for immunosuppressive drugs and/or immunomodulatory protocols altogether, for example, O-type RhD(-) lines for generation of universal red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>). Hematopoietic differentiation of hESCs has been extensively investigated in vitro, and hematopoietic precursors as well as differentiated progeny representing erythroid, myeloid, macrophage, megakaryocytic, and lymphoid lineages have been identified in differentiating hESC cultures. Previous studies also generated primitive erythroid cells from hESCs by embryoid body (EB) formation and coculturing with stromal cells. However, the efficient and controlled differentiation of hESCs into homogeneous RBC populations with oxygen-carrying capacity has not been previously achieved. In this chapter, we describe a robust system that can efficiently generate large numbers of hemangioblasts from multiple hESC lines using well-defined conditions and produce functional homogeneous RBCs with oxygen-carrying capacity in large scale. The homogeneous erythroid cells can be used for further mechanism studies.",M1
20227767,"Hostility of drug-free patients with schizophrenia and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels in red blood cells.Many reports suggest that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) influence the symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, it has also been reported that n-3 PUFAs control aggression and hostility. Acute symptoms of schizophrenia such as aggression can be a formidable clinical problem resulting in hospitalization. However, few investigations have determined the relationships between acute symptoms of drug-free schizophrenia and n-3 PUFAs. We recruited 75 inpatients with acute drug-free schizophrenia admitted to Chiba Psychiatric Medical Center, an emergency psychiatric hospital. Blood was sampled immediately after admission. The red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) fatty acid composition and hostility score of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores were measured. Multiple regression analysis showed that the concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and the ratio of EPA/arachidonic acid (AA) in RBC showed significant negative correlations with the hostility score of PANSS scores after adjustment for age and sex. AA, on the other hand, showed significant positive correlations. The tissue n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA levels were negatively and positively associated with the hostility score of PANSS scores, respectively, suggesting possible effects of PUFA levels on hostile behavior in patients with schizophrenia.",M1
20207810,"Defects in oxygen supply to skeletal muscle of prediabetic ZDF rats.In humans, prediabetes is characterized by marked increases in plasma insulin and near normal blood glucose levels as well as microvascular dysfunction of unknown origin. Using the extensor digitorum longus muscle of 7-wk inbred male Zucker diabetic fatty rats fed a high-fat diet as a model of prediabetes, we tested the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia contributes to impaired O(2) delivery in skeletal muscle. Using in vivo video microscopy, we determined that the total O(2) supply to capillaries in the extensor digitorum longus muscle of prediabetic rats was reduced to 64% of controls with a lower O(2) supply rate per capillary and higher O(2) extraction resulting in a decreased O(2) saturation at the venous end of the capillary network. These findings suggest a lower average tissue Po(2) in prediabetic animals. In addition, we determined that insulin, at concentrations measured in humans and Zucker diabetic fatty rats with prediabetes, inhibited the O(2)-dependent release of ATP from rat red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>). This inability to release ATP could contribute to the impaired O(2) delivery observed in rats with prediabetes, especially in light of the finding that the endothelium-dependent relaxation of resistance arteries from these animals is not different from controls and is not altered by insulin. Computational modeling confirmed a significant 8.3-mmHg decrease in average tissue Po(2) as well as an increase in the heterogeneity of tissue Po(2), implicating a failure of a regulatory system for O(2) supply. The finding that insulin attenuates the O(2)-dependent release of ATP from RBCs suggests that this defect in RBC physiology could contribute to a failure in the regulation of O(2) supply to meet the demand in skeletal muscle in prediabetes.",M1

Although chewing BQ has been linked to the patho-genesis of oral cancer, leukoplakia, and oral submucous fibrosis. The question whether the mixed constituents present in areca nut, which may exert cytotoxic effects on red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>), has never been addressed. METHODS: Heparinized blood specimens were obtained with informed consent from healthy laboratory personnel. RBCs were separated with the standard procedure and adjusted to 10% hematocrit with PBS. Various concentrations of areca nut extract (ANE; 100-800 microg/mL) were added to these RBC preparations and incubated at 37 degrees C for 4 hours. Two portions (0.4 mL each) of the incubated RBCs were then used for measuring osmotic deformability index and for observing RBC morphology with scanning electron microscopy. The remaining RBCs were used for determining membrane sulfhydryl groups and protein profiles by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Blood incubated with various concentrations of ANE showed concentration-dependent decreases in osmotic deformability index and membrane sulfhydryl groups. Membrane protein profiles revealed a significant loss of the band 3 fraction, with the concomitant appearance of several new protein bands in the electropheretogram. Finally, drastic morphological changes of ANE-treated RBCs were observed. CONCLUSION: We suggest that to assure the quality of transfusion, the blood donated by a habitual BQ chewer should be used with caution because of its possible contamination with areca nut ingredients that may be cytotoxic to RBCs.",M1
20204826,"Hemoglobin-vesicle, a cellular artificial oxygen carrier that fulfils the physiological roles of the red blood cell structure.Hb-vesicles (HbV) are artificial O(2) carriers encapsulating concentrated Hb solution (35 g/dL) with a phospholipid bilayer membrane (liposome). The concentration of the HbV suspension is extremely high ([Hb] = 10 g/dL) and it has an O(2) carrying capacity that is comparable to that of blood. HbV is much smaller than <e>RBC</e> (250 vs. 8000 nm), but it recreates the functions of RBCs; (i) the slower rate of O(2) unloading than Hb solution; (ii) colloid osmotic pressure is zero; (iii) the viscosity of a HbV suspension is adjustable to that of blood; (iv) HbV is finally captured by and degraded in RES; (v) co-encapsulation of an allosteric effector to regulate O(2) affinity; (vi) the lipid bilayer membrane prevents direct contact of Hb and vasculature; (vii) NO-binding is retarded to some extent by an intracellular diffusion barrier, and HbV does not induce vasoconstriction. (viii) Both RBC and HbV can be a carrier of not only O(2) but also exogenous CO. However, HbV has limitations such as a shorter functional half-life when compared with RBCs. On the other hand, the advantages of HbV are that it is pathogen-free and blood-type-antigen-free; moreover, it can withstand long-term storage of a few years, none of which can be achieved by the RBC transfusion systems.",M1
20204807,"Muscle microcirculatory O(2) exchange in health and disease.Much of our understanding of blood-muscle O(2) and substrate exchange is predicated on the presumption that, in resting muscle, a substantial proportion of the capillary bed does not sustain red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) or plasma flux. According to this notion, with contractions, more capillaries are  recruited  (i.e., begin flowing) and increased metabolic demands are supported by blood-myocyte O(2) and substrate flux in these newly recruited capillaries. This scenario is attractive because additional exchange vessels are added, and radial intercapillary diffusion distances reduced, as demands increase - but is it correct? The compelling weight of evidence gathered over the last 3 decades using intravital microscopy, phosphorescence quenching and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) techniques challenges conventional  wisdom  and indicates that the majority of capillaries support RBC flux at rest. Thus, at the onset of contractions blood-myocyte O(2) and substrate flux must increase in vessels that were already flowing at rest. This concept forces a radical revision of the control of blood-myocyte O(2) and substrate flux. This revision is essential if we are to understand the control of microcirculatory O(2) and substrate flux in health and resolve the mechanistic bases by which these processes are compromised in diseases such as chronic heart failure.",M1
20204262,"[Preoperative nutritional status and surgical risk. Identification of promissory biochemical markers]BACKGROUND: The fact that deficient or even marginal nutritional levels may contribute to increase morbidity and mortality in the surgical patient is well accepted. The usefulness of vitamin and mineral markers has not been much explored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of vitamin and mineral indicators as nutritional markers of surgical risk. METHODS: Biomarkers of vitamin A (plasma retinol), carotenes (plasma carotenes), vitamin C (plasma vitamin C), iron (hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum iron, transferrin saturation and erythrocyte protoporphyrin), calcium (calcium/creatinine in basal urine) and zinc (zinc/creatinine in basal urine), were performed 24 ours before surgery. Appearance of complications was evaluated in 100 adult patients from programmed surgical procedures of hernia (n = 41) or gallbladder lithiasis (n = 59), two of the most frequent interventions in general surgery services. RESULTS: Patients were grouped in those that presented postoperative complications (C; n = 26) and those who did not (NC; n=74). Two of the studied markers presented significant differences between both groups: plasma retinol and erythrocyte protoporphyrin. Plasma retinol of C was significantly lower than that obtained in NC: 33.2 +/- 13.5 microg/dl vs. 40.2 +/- 16.3 microg/dl; P = 0.0495 and an association between values below 30 microg/dl and postoperative complications was founded (53.8% in C vs. 30.1% in NC; P = 0.0360). Erythrocyte protoporphyrin of C was significantly higher to that obtained in NC: 52.0 +/- 34.0 microg/dl <e>RBC</e> vs. 36.8 +/- 17.5 microg/dl RBC; P = 0.0453 and the association between values higher than 70 microg/dl RBC and presence of complications were highly significant (25.0% vs. 4.2%; P = 0.0069). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the obtained results is concluded that plasma retinol and erythrocyte protoporphyrin would provide useful tools in evaluating surgical risk since they had been allowed to identify patients who were at risk of suffering postoperative complications.",M1
20204072,"The lipid moiety of haemozoin (Malaria Pigment) and P. falciparum parasitised red blood cells bind synthetic and native endothelin-1.Endothelin1 (ET-1) is a 21-amino acid peptide produced by the vascular endothelium under hypoxia, that acts locally as regulator of vascular tone and inflammation. The role of ET-1 in Plasmodium falciparum malaria is unknown, although tissue hypoxia is frequent as a result of the cytoadherence of parasitized red blood cell (pRBC) to the microvasculature. Here, we show that both synthetic and endothelial-derived ET-1 are removed by parasitized <e>RBC</e> (D10 and W2 strains, chloroquine sensitive, and resistant, resp.) and native haemozoin (HZ, malaria pigment), but not by normal RBC, delipidized HZ, or synthetic beta-haematin (BH). The effect is dose dependent, selective for ET-1, but not for its precursor, big ET-1, and not due to the proteolysis of ET-1. The results indicate that ET-1 binds to the lipids moiety of HZ and membranes of infected RBCs. These findings may help understanding the consequences of parasite sequestration in severe malaria.",M1

METHODS: According to the level of serum total cholesterol and weight, forty-eight adult male SD rats were divided randomly into six groups: normal control (group A), fed by normal feed; hyperlipidemia group (group B): fed by high fat diet; positive control group (group C): fed by high fat diet plus 10 mg * kg(-1) * d(-1) fluvastatin sodium; lycopene groups: fed by high fat diet plus 11 (group D), 22 (group E), 44 mg * kg(-1) * d(-1) (group F) lycopene through gavage, respectively. For all six groups, the level of serum total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) were measured at the end of 0, 1, 3 weeks of the study by taking samples from tail vein. At the end of the experiment, <e>RBC</e> and HGB were measured. RESULTS: After the rats were fed with high-fat feed for a week, models of hyperlipidemia rats were established. At the end of 3 weeks, TC of group A, B, C, D, E and F were (1.31 +/- 0.05), (19.40 +/- 0.54), (4.66 +/- 0.07), (7.18 +/- 0.06), (5.30 +/- 0.28), (4.49 +/- 0.23) mmol/L (F = 4395.72, P = 0.00), respectively;and TG were (0.42 +/- 0.01), (2.29 +/- 0.42), (0.69 +/- 0.03), (1.10 +/- 0.05), (0.63 +/- 0.02), (0.62 +/- 0.04) mmol/L (F = 127.26, P = 0.00), respectively; HGB were (143.13 +/- 6.33), (112.63 +/- 2.56), (124.75 +/- 3.62), (124.63 +/- 7.78), (132.38 +/- 6.41), (142.13 +/- 5.54) g/L (F = 34.14, P = 0.00), respectively; RBC were (6.75 +/- 0.60) x 10(12)/L, (5.08 +/- 0.75) x 10(12)/L, (7.14 +/- 0.82) x 10(12)/L, (5.94 +/- 1.09) x 10(12)/L, (6.18 +/- 0.36) x 10(12)/L and (7.31 +/- 0.58) x 10(12)/L (F = 10.35, P = 0.00), respectively.

20192900,"Drug delivery by red blood cells: vascular carriers designed by mother nature.IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Vascular delivery of several classes of therapeutic agents may benefit from carriage by red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>), for example, drugs that require delivery into phagocytic cells and those that must act within the vascular lumen. The fact that several protocols of infusion of RBC-encapsulated drugs are now being explored in patients illustrates a high biomedical importance for the field. AREAS COVERED BY THIS REVIEW: Two strategies for RBC drug delivery are discussed: encapsulation into isolated RBC ex vivo followed by infusion in compatible recipients and coupling therapeutics to the surface of RBC. Studies of pharmacokinetics and effects in animal models and in human studies of diverse therapeutic enzymes, antibiotics and other drugs encapsulated in RBC are described and critically analyzed. Coupling to RBC surface of compounds regulating immune response and complement, affinity ligands, polyethylene glycol alleviating immune response to donor RBC and fibrinolytic plasminogen activators are described. Also described is a new, translation-prone approach for RBC drug delivery by injection of therapeutics conjugated with fragments of antibodies providing safe anchoring of cargoes to circulating RBC, without need for ex vivo modification and infusion of RBC. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Readers will gain historical perspective, current status, challenges and perspectives of medical applications of RBC for drug delivery. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: RBC represent naturally designed carriers for intravascular drug delivery, characterized by unique longevity in the bloodstream, biocompatibility and safe physiological mechanisms for metabolism. New approaches for encapsulating drugs into RBC and coupling to RBC surface provide promising avenues for safe and widely useful improvement of drug delivery in the vascular system.",M1

Mouse RBCs were loaded with ovalbumin (RBC-OVA) and injected with Poly (I:C) into mice. Phagocytosis of RBC-OVA by macrophages and DCs was demonstrated to induce OVA-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell activation. Moreover, these CD8(+) T cells produced IFN-gamma and were able to induce OVA-specific cell lysis. Finally, T-cell response was demonstrated to be dependent on the dose-amount of antigen entrapped and this response could be maintained for up to 30 days.",M1
20186882,"Erythrocytes serve as a reservoir for cellular and extracellular sphingosine 1-phosphate.Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in blood is phosphorylated, stored, and transported by red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>). Release of S1P from RBC into plasma is a regulated process that does not occur in plasma- or serum-free media. Plasma fractionation and incubations with isolated and recombinant proteins identified high density lipoprotein (HDL) and serum albumin (SA) as non-redundant endogenous triggers for S1P release from RBC. S1P bound to SA and HDL was able to stimulate the S1P(1) receptor in calcium flux experiments. The binding capability of acceptor molecules triggers S1P release, as demonstrated with the anti-S1P antibody Sphingomab. More S1P was extracted from RBC membranes by HDL than by SA. Blood samples from anemic patients confirmed a reduced capacity for S1P release in plasma. In co-cultures of RBC and endothelial cells (EC), we observed transcellular transportation of S1P as a second function of RBC-associated S1P in the absence of SA and HDL and during tight RBC-EC contact, mimicking conditions in tissue interstitium and capillaries. In contrast to S1P bound to SA and HDL, RBC-associated S1P was significantly incorporated by EC after S1P lyase (SGPL1) inhibition. RBC-associated S1P, therefore, has two functions: (1) It contributes to the cellular pool of SGPL1-sensitive S1P in tissues after transcellular transportation and (2) it helps maintain extracellular S1P levels via SA and HDL independently from SGPL1 activity.",M1
20172355,"Irregular xenoantibodies against human red blood cells in Papio anubis, P ursinus, P hamadryas, P papio, Saimiri sciureus, and Macaca mulatta: possible effect on xenotransplantation results.OBJECTIVE: To assess the presence of irregular xenoantibodies against human red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) in 6 primate species used in xenotransplantation and other experimental procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples from 109 baboons of 4 different species (olive, chacma, sacred, and Guinea), 38 rhesus macaques, and 30 squirrel monkeys were tested for irregular xenoantibodies using an agglutination test using human RBCs of known phenotype for Rh, Kell, Kidd, Lewis, Lutheran, P1, and Duffy antigens, commercially available as RBC I, II, and III. RESULTS: We found hemagglutination for RBC I in 49%, 22%, 100%, 57%, 32%, and 33% of olive, chacma, sacred, and Guinea baboons, rhesus macaques, and squirrel monkey, respectively. The frequency for RBC II was 49%, 50%, 100%, 57%, 37%, and 33%, respectively, and for RBC III was 56%, 37%, 100%, 79%, 34%, and 33%, respectively. There were differences in frequency depending on the sex of the rhesus macaques; all 3 RBCs tested were higher in the females: 44% vs 0%, P = .008; 48% vs 1%, P = .02, and 44% vs 9.1%, P = .04 for RBC I, II, and III, respectively. There were differences due to age in only olive baboons, and a higher frequency in younger animals compared with juvenile, subadult, and adult animals for all 3 human RBCs. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of irregular antibodies in the presence of primate serum should be taken into account during any experimental xenotransplantation protocol.",M1
20166670,"Enhanced cell surface polymer grafting in concentrated and nonreactive aqueous polymer solutions.Macromolecular cell surface modification techniques have shown tremendous utility in various biomedical applications. However, a major drawback concerns inefficient cell surface modification caused by the poor association of hydrophilic macromolecules with cell surfaces. Here, a novel, highly efficient, and universal strategy in which nonreactive  additive  macromolecules are used to modulate the grafting efficiency of cell surface reactive, hydrophilic macromolecules is described. Unprecedented enhanced cell surface modifications by up to 10-fold were observed when various concentrations of a suitable  additive  polymer was present with a constant and low concentration of a  reactive  macromolecule. The importance of this increased efficiency and the possible mechanisms involved are discussed. The cell compatible technique is demonstrated in the case of four different cell types--red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>), leukocytes, platelets, and Jurkat cells. A practical application of grafting macromolecules to cell surfaces in concentrated polymer solutions is demonstrated by the enhanced camouflage of RBC surface antigens for the development of RhD null RBC. In principle, the technique can be adapted to various macromolecular systems and cell types, with significant potential for biomedical applications such as live cell based technologies.",M1
20158688,"Supernates from stored red blood cells inhibit platelet aggregation.BACKGROUND: Previously, we reported that red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) stored in AS-5 accumulated proinflammatory substances during storage. We observed in those studies that supernates from nonleukoreduced (NLR) RBCs reduced mean anti-CD41a-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) fluorescence on platelets (PLTs), indicative of decreased expression of glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa on the PLT membrane. The objective of this study was to determine if supernates from stored RBCs impaired PLT aggregation as a consequence of reduction in GPIIb/IIIa expression. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Leukoreduced (LR) and NLR RBC units were prepared in AS-5 and stored at 1 to 6 degrees C for 6 weeks. Supernates from RBC samples collected every 2 weeks were mixed with freshly collected type-matched blood and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C. PLTs in each incubated blood sample were evaluated for GPIIb/IIIa expression by flow cytometry and for aggregation response to collagen by whole blood aggregometry. RESULTS: Supernates from stored NLR RBCs reduced CD41a-FITC fluorescence on PLTs by 15% to 31%. A reduction in fluorescence was induced by supernates of RBCs stored for 14 days and increased as storage time increased. Supernates from Day 42 NLR RBCs reduced the mean amplitude of PLT aggregation by 31% compared to Day 0 supernates and lengthened the time before onset of aggregation by 21%. In addition, amplitude correlated directly and lag time correlated inversely with CD41a-FITC fluorescence in all samples. Supernates from prestorage LR RBCs did not affect PLT CD41a-FITC fluorescence or aggregation response. CONCLUSIONS: Substances that decrease expression of GPIIb/IIIa and inhibit PLT aggregation accumulate in NLR RBCs. Accumulation of this material is prevented by leukoreduction.",M1
20145884,"Chromium in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), erythrocytes, plasma and urine in the biomonitoring of chrome-plating workers exposed to soluble Cr(VI).Chromium (Cr) levels measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC-Cr) and urine (Cr-U) at the beginning and end of working shifts were related to those measured in erythrocytes (Cr-<e>RBC</e>) and plasma in 14 non-smoking male chrome-plating workers exposed to Cr(VI) in soluble aerosol form who did not report any significant current or past respiratory disease. Cr-U mainly correlated with Cr-P (Cr in plasma) at the end of the working shift (r(2) = 0.59, p &lt; 0.01), whereas Cr-RBC correlated with EBC-Cr (r(2) = 0.32, p &lt; 0.05); at the beginning of the shift, the only significant correlation was between Cr-U and Cr-RBC (r(2) = 0.74, p &lt; 0.01). The clearance of Cr(iii) arising from Cr(VI) reduction was rapid, thus making Cr-U and Cr-P ideal biomarkers of the most recent exposure, whereas Cr-RBC may represent the fraction of Cr(VI) that reaches the bloodstream in non-reduced form and therefore depends on the airway inhaled dose represented by EBC-Cr. Cr-RBC clearance is slower and not only involves the free diffusion of Cr(iii) from RBC to plasma, but probably also involves more complicated kinetic phenomena involving other tissues and organs, which may explain the correlation between Cr-RBC and Cr-U and the lack of correlation Cr-RBC and Cr-P at least 36 h after the last exposure. In conclusion, our findings reinforce the idea that measuring Cr in EBC can significantly contribute to traditional biomonitoring by providing specific information at the target organ level and integrating our knowledge of Cr toxicokinetics.",M1

20138490,"Assessment of the hemorheological profile of koala and echidna.Koala, a marsupial, and echidna, a monotreme, are mammals native to Australia. Blood viscosity (62.5-1250s(-1)), red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) deformability, RBC aggregation, aggregability and surface charge, and hematological parameters were measured in blood samples from six koalas and six echidnas and compared to adult human blood. Koala had the largest RBC mean cell volume (107.7+/-2.6fl) compared to echidna (81.3+/-2.6fl) and humans (88.4+/-1.2fl). Echidna blood exhibited the highest viscosity over the entire range of shear rates. Echidna RBC were significantly less deformable than koala RBC but more deformable than human RBC. Echidna RBC had significantly lower aggregability (i.e., aggregation in standardized dextran medium) than koala or human RBC, while aggregation in autologous plasma was similar for the three species. Erythrocyte surface charge as indexed by RBC electrophoretic mobility was similar for human and echidna cells but was 40% lower for koala RBC. Data obtained during this preliminary study indicate that koala and echidna have distinct hemorheological characteristics; investigation of these properties may reveal patterns relevant to specific behavioral and physiological features of these animals.",M1
20132790,"Interaction of the exported malaria protein Pf332 with the red blood cell membrane skeleton.Intra-erythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites synthesize and export numerous proteins into the red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) cytosol, where some bind to the RBC membrane skeleton. These interactions are responsible for the altered antigenic, morphological and functional properties of parasite-infected red blood cells (IRBCs). Plasmodium falciparum protein 332 (Pf332) is a large parasite protein that associates with the membrane skeleton and who's function has recently been elucidated. Using recombinant fragments of Pf332 in in vitro interaction assays, we have localised the specific domain within Pf332 that binds to the RBC membrane skeleton to an 86 residue sequence proximal to the C-terminus of Pf332. We have shown that this region partakes in a specific and saturable interaction with actin (K(d)=0.60 microM) but has no detectable affinity for spectrin. The only exported malaria protein previously known to bind to actin is PfEMP3 but here we demonstrate that there is no competition for actin-binding between PfEMP3 and Pf332, suggesting that they bind to different target sequences in actin.",M1
20130222,"Comparative analysis of nitrite uptake and hemoglobin-nitrite reactions in erythrocytes: sorting out uptake mechanisms and oxygenation dependencies.Nitrite uptake into red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) precedes its intracellular reactions with hemoglobin (Hb) that forms nitric oxide (NO) during hypoxia. We investigated the uptake of nitrite and its reactions with Hb at different oxygen saturations (So(2)), using RBCs with (carp and rabbit) and without (hagfish and lamprey) anion exchanger-1 (AE1) in the membrane, with the aim to unravel the mechanisms and oxygenation dependencies of nitrite transport. Added nitrite rapidly diffused into the RBCs until equilibrium. The distribution ratio of nitrite across the membrane agreed with that expected from HNO(2) diffusion and AE1-mediated facilitated NO(2)(-) diffusion. Participation of HNO(2) diffusion was emphasized by rapid transmembrane nitrite equilibration also in the natural AE1 knockouts. Following the equilibration, nitrite was consumed by reacting with Hb, which created a continued inward diffusion controlled by intracellular reaction rates. Changes in nitrite uptake with So(2), pH, or species were accordingly explained by corresponding changes in reaction rates. In carp, nitrite uptake rates increased linearly with decreasing So(2) over the entire So(2) range. In rabbit, nitrite uptake rates were highest at intermediate So(2), producing a bell-shaped relationship with So(2). Nitrite consumption increased approximately 10-fold with a 1 unit decrease in pH, as expected from the involvement of protons in the reactions with Hb. The reaction of nitrite with deoxyhemoglobin was favored over that with oxyhemoglobin at intermediate So(2). We propose a model for RBC nitrite uptake that involves both HNO(2) diffusion and AE1-mediated transport and that explains both the present and previous (sometimes puzzling) results.",M1
20122720,"Adsorption of amphiphilic hyperbranched polyglycerol derivatives onto human red blood cells.Hydrophobically derivatized hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers bearing stearoyl chains (HPG-C18-PEG) were originally developed as human serum albumin substitutes and further as a unimolecular drug delivery system. In view of these in vivo applications and the potential for membrane interaction by these materials due to their amphiphilic structure, determining the adsorption of the polymers to human red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) is an important issue. This paper reports on the in vitro adsorption to RBCs of tritium-radiolabeled HPG-C18-PEG polymers. The morphological changes of RBCs associated with the adsorption were also examined by light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) suggests that the binding site of the polymers on RBCs is the cell membrane. Adsorption experiments show that, in the medium of either saline or plasma, the binding amount of the polymers to RBCs increases with increased polymer concentration in a manner which implies simple Langmurian behavior. The binding amount in saline is of the order of 10(5) molecules/cell at an equilibrium concentration of 1 mg/mL of HPG-C18-PEG polymer. The RBC morphology depends on the adsorbed amount; the cells become crenated in high concentrations (5 and 10 mg/mL) of the polymer solutions in the absence of plasma proteins. Interestingly, a large amount of polymers remain bound to RBCs even after washes with plasma (of the order of 10(4) molecules/cell). Thus, the bound polymers might have an extended circulating time by  hitchhiking  on RBCs in the bloodstream. These results provide significant information and insight for related studies of the interaction of amphiphilic molecules with cell membranes and for in vivo applications of biopolymers as drug delivery systems.",M1
20122252,"Optimized high gradient magnetic separation for isolation of Plasmodium-infected red blood cells.BACKGROUND: Highly purified infected red blood cells (irbc), or highly synchronized parasite cultures, are regularly required in malaria research. Conventional isolation and synchronization rely on density and osmotic fragility of irbc, respectively. High gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) offers an alternative based on intrinsic magnetic properties of irbc, avoiding exposure to chemicals and osmotic stress. Successful HGMS concentration in malaria research was previously reported using polymer coated columns, while HGMS depletion has not been described yet. This study presents a new approach to both HGMS concentration and depletion in malaria research, rendering polymer coating unnecessary. METHODS: A dipole magnet generating a strong homogenous field was custom assembled. Polypropylene syringes were fitted with one-way stopcocks and filled with stainless steel wool. <e>Rbc</e> from Plasmodium falciparum cultures were resuspended in density and viscosity optimized HGMS buffers and HGMS processed. Purification and depletion results were analysed by flow cytometer and light microscopy. Viability was evaluated by calculating the infection rate after re-culturing of isolates. RESULTS: In HGMS concentration, purity of irbc isolates from asynchronous cultures consistently ranged from 94.8% to 98.4% (mean 95.7%). With further optimization, over 90% of isolated irbc contained segmented schizonts. Processing time was less than 45 min. Reinfection rates ranged from 21.0% to 56.4%. In HGMS depletion, results were comparable to treatment with sorbitol, as demonstrated by essentially identical development of cultures. CONCLUSION: The novel HGMS concentration procedure achieves high purities of segmented stage irbc from standard asynchronous cultures, and is the first HGMS depletion alternative to sorbitol lysis. It represents a simple and highly efficient alternative to conventional irbc concentration and synchronization methods.",M1
20113503,"Uptake of purines in Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes is mostly mediated by the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter and the human facilitative nucleobase transporter.BACKGROUND: Plasmodium parasites are unable to synthesize purines de novo and have to salvage them from the host. Due to this limitation in the parasite, purine transporters have been an area of focus in the search for anti-malarial drugs. Although the uptake of purines through the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1), the human facilitative nucleobase transporter (hFNT1) and the parasite-induced new permeation pathway (NPP) has been studied, no information appears to exist on the relative contribution of these three transporters to the uptake of adenosine and hypoxanthine. Using the appropriate transporter inhibitors, the role of each of these salvage pathways to the overall purine transport in intraerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum was systematically investigated. METHODS: The transport of adenosine, hypoxanthine and adenine into uninfected and P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes was investigated in the presence or absence of classical inhibitors of the hFNT1, hENT1 and NPP. The effective inhibition of the various transporters by the classical inhibitors was verified using appropriate known substrates. The ability of high concentration of unlabelled substrates to saturate these transporters was also studied. RESULTS: Transport of exogenous purine into infected or uninfected erythrocytes occurred primarily through saturable transporters rather than through the NPP. Hypoxanthine and adenine appeared to enter erythrocytes mainly through the hFNT1 nucleobase transporter whereas adenosine entered predominantly through the hENT1 nucleoside transporter. The rate of purine uptake was approximately doubled in infected cells compared to uninfected erythrocytes. In addition, it was found that the rate of adenosine uptake was considerably higher than the rate of hypoxanthine uptake in infected human red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>). It was also demonstrated that furosemide inhibited the transport of purine bases through hFNT1. CONCLUSION: Collectively, the data obtained in this study clearly show that the endogenous host erythrocyte transporters hENT1 and hFNT1, rather than the NPP, are the major route of entry of purine into parasitized RBC. Inhibitors of hENT1 and hFNT1, as well as the NPP, should be considered in the development of anti-malarials targeted to purine transport.",M1
20113453,"Gravity sedimentation of granulocytapheresis concentrates with hydroxyethyl starch efficiently removes red blood cells and retains neutrophils.BACKGROUND: Transfusion of granulocytapheresis concentrates can be limited by the volume of incompatible donor red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) in the component. Efficient reduction of RBCs in granulocyte units would result in safe transfusion of RBC-incompatible units. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Granulocyte concentrates were collected by continuous-flow apheresis from granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and dexamethasone-stimulated volunteer donors, with 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) added continuously during apheresis as a RBC sedimenting agent to enhance granulocyte collection efficiency. After collection, the component was placed in a plasma extractor for 4 hours. A sharp line of demarcation between the starch-sedimented RBCs and the granulocyte-rich supernatant developed, and the supernatant was transferred to a sterilely docked transfer pack. RBC reduction and white blood cell recovery were determined. RESULTS: Gravity sedimentation was performed on 165 granulocyte concentrates. Mean sedimentation time was 267 minutes (range, 150-440 min). RBC depletion was 92% (range, 71%-99%) with mean residual RBC content of 3.2 +/- 1.4 mL. Twelve percent of components contained less than 2 mL of RBCs. Mean granulocyte and platelet (PLT) recoveries were 80 and 81%, respectively. There were no transfusion reactions or signs of hemolysis after transfusion of 66 RBC-incompatible granulocyte concentrates (RBC volume, 1.6-8.2 mL). The remaining concentrates were used for topical or intrapleural applications. CONCLUSIONS: RBCs were significantly reduced and granulocytes and PLTs effectively retained in G-CSF/steroid-mobilized granulocyte components collected with HES and processed by gravity sedimentation. This procedure allows safe transfusion of RBC-incompatible sedimented granulocyte units and may be used to expand the pool of available granulocyte donors for specific recipients.",M1
20112823,"Oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation.The field of radiation biochemistry has provided tremendous impact in recent years as extensive research on free radicals has implicated them in radiation damage. An important offshoot of this field is the branch dealing with radiological protection in medical applications like diagnostic radiology. Hence, we decided to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation (x-rays) in the work environment of x-ray technicians (radiographers), by comparing their <e>RBC</e> malondialdehyde, % hemolysis, catalase and plasma vitamin E levels with those of controls. There was a significant increase in the susceptibility of RBCs to hemolysis in radiographers compared to controls. Malondialdehyde and catalase levels were slightly increased in the radiographers, but this did not disturb the steady state concentration of their plasma vitamin E. These findings go in favour of theories stating that exposure to low dose ionizing radiation does cause a greater amount of oxidative stress, than that caused during normal routine metabolic processes.",M1
20108207,"Supplementation with a multivitamin containing 800 microg of folic acid shortens the time to reach the preventive red blood cell folate concentration in healthy women.Background: The lowest risk of having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD) was related to red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) folate concentrations of &gt;906 nmol/L. For NTD prevention, it is recommended that women use periconceptional supplementation of 400 microg/day folic acid. Using this dose previous studies indicate that RBC folate &gt;906 nmol/L was not reached within four weeks of supplementation. Objective: The effectiveness of a multivitamin/multimineral supplement containing 800 microg folic acid (verum) was evaluated using RBC folate concentration exceeding 906 nmol/L as primary endpoint. In addition, the time frame of achieving the threshold level was established as well as the effect of supplementation of other B vitamins on folate metabolism. Subjects and Methods: 46 healthy females received 800 microg/day of folic acid or placebo for 16 weeks. Blood samples were collected in four-week intervals. Plasma and RBC folate were measured with the microbiological method. Results: Mean (+/-SED) RBC folate increased over time to 1430+/-53 nmol/L, but did not reach a steady state after 16 weeks of intervention. Mean time to reach the target level was 4.2 +/- 3.5 weeks in the verum group. Intake of verum also led to an increase over time of plasma folate. Conclusions: Preventive RBC folate concentration of more than 906 nmol/L can be reached within four weeks of supplementation with daily intake of 800 microg folic acid. With respect to NTD prevention, we suggest the re-evaluation of the current recommendation of folic acid supplementation.",M1
20104680,"[Effects of intermittent hypoxic exposure on the parameter of erythrocyte and serum hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha and erythropoietin levels]AIM: To investigate the effects of intermittent hypoxic exposure and normoxic convalescence on the parameter of erythrocyte and serum hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) and erythropoietin (EPO) levels. METHODS: Rat models of intermittent hypoxic exposure were established, combined with the clinical research on volunteers experiencing the intermittent plateau work. Blood samples for red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) counts, hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (HCT) were collected, serum HIF-1alpha and EPO levels were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: RBC counts, Hb concentration and HCT were significantly higher than the normoxic group (P &lt; 0.05), after exposure of rats to hypoxia from 7 to 28 days. Compared with the normoxic group, serum HIF-1alpha levels were higher in the group of IH3, 7, 14 days, and EPO had a corresponding increase in the group of IH3, 7 days. Then, a decrease was observed in parameter of erythrocyte and serum HIF-1alpha and EPO levels after 14 days normoxic convalescence treat. In volunteers studies, RBC counts in 8 months group and Hb concentration in 2 years group were significantly higher than the plain group (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the plain group, EPO had no significant differences in any of plateau group. CONCLUSION: Intermittent hypoxic exposure can enhance serum hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha and erythropointin levels and the generation of red blood cells, which leads to an increase in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. The results have changed with the hypoxic exposure period prolonged. Normoxic convalescence after intermittent hypoxic exposure can make the related indexes reduced, and contribute to the organism recovery.",M1
20090998,"Sheathless inertial cell ordering for extreme throughput flow cytometry.Rapid and accurate differentiation of cell types within a heterogeneous solution is a challenging but important task for various applications in biological research and medicine. Flow cytometry is the gold standard in cell analysis and is regularly used for blood analysis (i.e., complete blood counts). Flow cytometry, however, lacks sufficient throughput to analyze rare cells in blood or other dilute solutions in a reasonable time period because it is an inherently serial process. In this study, we exploit inertial effects for label- and sheath-free parallel flow cytometry with extreme throughput. We demonstrate a microfluidic device that consists of 256 high-aspect (W = 16 microm, H = 37 microm) parallel channels yielding a sample rate up to 1 million cells s(-1), only limited by the field-of-view of our high-speed optical interrogation method. The particles or cells flowing through the channels are focused to one uniform z-position (SD = +/-1.81 microm) with uniform downstream velocity (U(ave) = 0.208 +/- 0.004 m s(-1)) to reduce the probability of overlap and out-of-focus blur and provide similar cell signature images for accurate detection and analysis. To demonstrate a proof-of-concept application of our system operating at these throughputs, we conducted automated <e>RBC</e> and leukocyte counts on diluted whole blood and achieved high counting sensitivity and specificity (86-97%) compared to visual inspection of raw images. As no additional external forces are required to create ordered streams of cells, this approach has the potential for future applications in cost-effective hematology or rare-cell analysis platforms with extreme throughput capabilities when integrated with suitable large field-of view imaging or interrogation methods.",M1
20089728,"Associations of very high intakes of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids with biomarkers of chronic disease risk among Yup'ik Eskimos.BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the associations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with biomarkers of chronic disease risk in populations with high intakes. OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) EPA and DHA, as percentages of total fatty acids, with biomarkers of chronic disease risk across a wide range of EPA and DHA intakes. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study of 357 Yup'ik Eskimos, generalized additive models were used to plot covariate-adjusted associations of EPA and DHA with chronic disease biomarkers. Linear regression models were used to test for the statistical significance of these associations. RESULTS: Means (5th-95th percentiles) for RBC EPA and DHA were 2.8% (0.5-5.9%) and 6.8% (3.3-9.0%), respectively. Associations of EPA and DHA were inverse and linear for triglycerides (beta +/- SE = -0.10 +/- 0.01 and -0.05 +/- 0.01, respectively) and positive and linear for HDL cholesterol (beta +/- SE = 2.0 +/- 0.5 and 0.9 +/- 0.6, respectively) and apolipoprotein A-I (beta +/- SE = 2.6 +/- 0.8 and 1.7 +/- 0.8, respectively). Positive linear associations of DHA with LDL and total cholesterol (beta +/- SE = 7.5 +/- 1.4 and 6.80 +/- 1.57, respectively) were observed; for EPA, these associations were nonlinear and restricted to concentrations approximately &lt;5% of total fatty acids. Associations of EPA and DHA with C-reactive protein were inverse and nonlinear: for EPA, the association appeared stronger at concentrations approximately &gt;3% of total fatty acids; for DHA, it was observed only at concentrations approximately &gt;7% of total fatty acids. CONCLUSION: Increasing EPA and DHA intakes to amounts well above those consumed by the general US population may have strong beneficial effects on chronic disease risk.",M1
20088839,"New antigen in the Dombrock blood group system, DOYA, ablates expression of Do(a) and weakens expression of Hy, Jo(a), and Gy(a) antigens.BACKGROUND: The Dombrock (Do) blood group system consists of five distinct antigens: Do(a), Do(b), Gy(a), Hy, and Jo(a). Our finding of a patient whose plasma contained a Do-related alloantibody suggested the presence of a sixth antigen. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Standard hemagglutination, flow cytometry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods were used throughout. Protein homology modeling was used to map the amino acid change on the protein structure. RESULTS: The patient's red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) typed as Do(a-b-), Hy+(w), Jo(a+(w)), and Gy(a+(w)). The patient's plasma agglutinated RBCs with common Dombrock phenotypes. Reactivity with Hy- and Jo(a-) RBC samples was weak, and Gy(a-) RBC samples were nonreactive. DNA analysis showed the patient to be DO*793A (DO*A/DO*A), DO*323G, and DO*350C, which predicts the Do(a+b-), Hy+, and Jo(a+) phenotype, and revealed a homozygous single-nucleotide change of 547T&gt;G in Exon 2 that is predicted to change tyrosine at Amino Acid Position 183 to aspartic acid. This missense substitution introduced a BtgZI restriction enzyme site. The sequence data were confirmed with a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay and revealed that the patient's parents and children were heterozygous DO*547T/G. Homology modeling predicted that the 183Tyr substitution by Asp altered the Cys182 environment and influenced the formation and/or stability of the Cys182-Cys231 disulfide bond. CONCLUSION: The patient's DO genes have a single-nucleotide change, which leads to the absence of the high-prevalence antigen DOYA. The absence of this antigen is associated with 183Asp and silencing of Do(a) and weakening of Gy(a), Hy, and Jo(a) antigens.",M1
20086249,"Regulation of primary alloantibody response through antecedent exposure to a microbial T-cell epitope.Humoral alloimmunization to red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) antigens is a clinically significant problem that can lead to transfusion reactions and difficulty in locating future compatible blood for transfusion. However, factors regulating responder/nonresponder status are only partially understood. Herein, we identify a series of microbes with 100% identity in 8- to 9-amino acid peptides containing the variant amino acids in Kell, Kidd, and Duffy antigens. To test the hypothesis that infection with such a microbe could predispose to RBC alloimmunization, a mouse model was developed using murine polyoma virus expressing a defined CD4(+) T-cell epitope ovalbumin(323-339) ((OVA)(323-339)) and subsequent transfusion with RBCs expressing a B-cell epitope (hen egg lysozyme [HEL]) fused to (OVA)(323-339). Whereas infection alone induced no detectable anti-HEL, subsequent RBC transfusion induced 100- to 1000-fold more anti-HEL in mice that had been previously infected compared with control mice. This effect did not occur with wild-type polyoma virus or RBCs expressing HEL alone. Together, these data indicate that prior exposure to a pathogen with small peptide homology to RBC antigens can lead to an enhanced primary alloantibody response. As such priming is not detectable by current clinical tests, it is unknown to what extent this occurs in human alloimmunization.",M1
20085754,"<e>RBC</e> velocities in single capillaries of mouse and rat brains are the same, despite 10-fold difference in body size.Employing high-speed camera laser-scanning confocal microscopy with RBC-tracking software, we previously showed that RBC velocities in intraparenchymal capillaries of rat cerebral cortex are distributed over a wide range. In the present work, we measured RBC velocities in mice, whose body weights are less than one-tenth of that of rats. In an isoflurane-anesthetized mouse, a cranial window was opened in the left temporo-parietal region. Intravenously administered FITC-labeled RBCs were automatically recognized and tracked frame-by-frame at 500fps, and the velocities of all RBCs recognized were calculated with our Matlab-domain software, KEIO-IS2. Among 15241 RBCs detected in the ROI in 21 mice, 1655 were identified as flowing in capillaries. The velocities of these RBCs ranged from 0.15 to 8.6mm/s, with a mean of 2.03+/-1.42mm/s. A frequency distribution plot showed that RBC velocities were clustered at around 1.0mm/s, tailing up to 8.6mm/s, and 59% of the RBCs in capillaries showed velocities within the range of 0.5 to 2.0mm/s. Unexpectedly, these characteristics of RBC velocities in mice were very similar to those of rats, despite differences in RBC diameter (6.0 vs. 6.5microm), body size (25 vs. 327g), heart rate (461 vs. 319bpm) and arterial blood pressure (86 vs. 84mmHg). We speculate that physical factors relating to oxygen exchange may constrain general RBC velocity in capillaries to a certain range for optimum oxygen exchange, regardless of species.",M1
20080583,"Metabolic remodeling of the human red blood cell membrane.The remarkable deformability of the human red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) results from the coupled dynamic response of the phospholipid bilayer and the spectrin molecular network. Here we present quantitative connections between spectrin morphology and membrane fluctuations of human RBCs by using dynamic full-field laser interferometry techniques. We present conclusive evidence that the presence of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) facilitates non-equilibrium dynamic fluctuations in the RBC membrane that are highly correlated with the biconcave shape of RBCs. Spatial analysis of the fluctuations reveals that these non-equilibrium membrane vibrations are enhanced at the scale of spectrin mesh size. Our results indicate that the dynamic remodeling of the coupled membranes powered by ATP results in non-equilibrium membrane fluctuations manifesting from both metabolic and thermal energies and also maintains the biconcave shape of RBCs.",M1
20070147,"Blood cell findings resembling Bartonella spp.Some Bartonella species are able to invade red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>) and may cause persistent infection in the susceptible host. Use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrates, inside erythrocytes, the typical triple-walled agents. However, when examining ultrathin sections of blood cells, the authors have, on several occasions, detected intraerythrocytic abnormalities that mimic but are not typical of Bartonella spp. Small endovesicles, pseudoinclusions, cavities, and irregular hemoglobin granules distribution, resulting in regions of increased or decreased electron density, may be observed in the erythrocytes and platelets, which may be confused with bartonellas. So far, detailed ultrastructural findings of Bartonella spp. in blood cells have not yet been described. Aiming to improve TEM interpretation of blood cells changes, in routine examination of blood sections of patients with suspected bartonellosis, the authors studied the morphological findings they have observed, and present their putative nature, according to information in the literature.",M1
20069755,"Directed evolution of an anti-human red blood cell antibody.We have earlier described a haemagglutination-based assay for on-site detection of antibodies to HIV using whole blood. The reagent in this assay comprises of monovalent Fab fragment of an anti-human <e>RBC</e> antibody fused to immunodominant antigens of HIV-1 and HIV-2. In the present work, we describe a rational and systematic method for directed evolution of scFv and Fab antihuman RBC antibody fragments. Based on homology modeling and germline sequence alignments of antibodies, target residues in the anti-RBC MAb B6 sequence were identified for mutagenesis.A combinatorial library of 107 clones was constructed and subjected to selection on whole RBC under competitive binding conditions to identify several phage-displayed B6 scFv clones with improved binding as determined in an agglutination assay.Selected VL and VH sequences were shuffled to generate a second generation phage-displayed Fab library which on panning yielded Fab clones with several fold better binding than wild type. The mutants with better binding also displayed more Fab molecules per phage particle indicating improved in vivo folding which was also confirmed by their increased periplasmic secretion compared to the wild type. The mutant Fab molecules also showed superior characteristics in large scale production by in vitro folding of LC and Fd. The biophysical measurements involving thermal and chemical denaturation and renaturation kinetics clearly showed that two of the mutant Fab molecules possessed significantly improved characteristics as compared to the wild type B6 Fab.Structural modelling revealed that B6 Fab mutants had increased hydrogen bonding resulting in increased stability. Our approach provides a novel and useful strategy to obtain recombinant antibodies with improved characteristics.",M1
20063313,"Regulatory T cells in human geohelminth infection suppress immune responses to BCG and Plasmodium falciparum.Chronic helminth infections induce T-cell hyporesponsiveness, which may affect immune responses to other pathogens or to vaccines. This study investigates the influence of Treg activity on proliferation and cytokine responses to BCG and Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized <e>RBC</e> in Indonesian schoolchildren. Geohelminth-infected children's in vitro T-cell proliferation to either BCG or pRBC was reduced compared to that of uninfected children. Although the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(hi)FOXP3(+) T cells was similar regardless of infection status, the suppressive activity differed between geohelminth-infected and geohelminth-uninfected groups: Ag-specific proliferative responses increased upon CD4(+)CD25(hi) T-cell depletion in geohelminth-infected subjects only. In addition, IFN-gamma production in response to both BCG and parasitized RBC was increased after removal of CD4(+)CD25(hi) T cells. These data demonstrate that geohelminth-associated Treg influence immune responses to bystander Ag of mycobacteria and plasmodia. Geohelminth-induced immune modulation may have important consequences for co-endemic infections and vaccine trials.",M1
20059238,"Feasibility of Doppler variance imaging for red blood cell aggregation characterization.An abnormal level of red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) aggregation is a clinical condition associated with many pathologies. Our purpose is to investigate the feasibility of spectral domain phase-resolved optical Doppler tomography incorporated with Doppler variance imaging to characterize RBC aggregation in flowing blood. Variance/standard deviation (SD) of the Doppler frequency spectrum of porcine blood flowing through a glass tube (diameter 300 microm) at 4.7 mms is measured. For nonaggregating RBCs with hematocrits of 20, 40, and 60%, the mean centerline SD values were 34.2+/-1.2, 47.8+/-1.0, and 47.2+/-0.5, respectively. After dextran 500 induction, the SD value decreased significantly to 29.9+/-0.7, 37.9+/-3.0, and 40.1+/-0.6 (P&lt;0.01) in the aggregated blood, respectively. The results demonstrate that Doppler variance imaging using the SD value is capable of differentiating normal and aggregated blood.",M1

This rekindled the decades old discussion regarding the impact of RBC aging and storage lesions in patient care. The objectives of this review are to provide readers with an overview of the process of banking RBC that may have an impact on its quality, the reported clinical impact of storage lesions, the consequences of transfusing new RBC units only to the nation's blood supply and potential solutions that may improve the feasibility of blood banks to issue new blood units only.",M1
20051061,"Quality evaluation of frozen apheresis red blood cell storage with 21-day postthaw storage in additive solution 3 and saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol: biochemical and chromium-51 recovery measures.BACKGROUND: The Czech Republic decided to build the frozen red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) bank for military contingency and civil emergency preparedness. Storage methods were validated with (51)Cr recovery measures out to 21 days postthaw. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 139 apheresis RBC units collected in additive solution (additive solution 3 [AS-3] or saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol [SAG-M]) were obtained from volunteers by double erythrocytapheresis; all were sterilely glycerolized, frozen, stored for at least 30 days at a minimum of -65 degrees C in collection or cryogenic bags, thawed, sterilely deglycerolized, and stored at 4 +/- 2 degrees C for up to 21 days in AS-3 or SAG-M. Units were sampled before storage and after thaw weekly. Metabolic intermediates and (51)Cr recovery measures were obtained to determine the index of therapeutic effectiveness (ITE). RESULTS: Despite losses associated with cryoconservation and eventual transfer to cryogenic bags, 3-week storage with optimum ITE was obtained with frozen storage in primary collection or cryogenic bags and postthaw storage in AS-3. Such cells would pass as acceptable in vitro hematology and biochemistry variables. CONCLUSIONS: A system for frozen RBC storage with 3-week, postthaw, liquid storage has been validated. With commercially available components and automated processing, it is capable of supporting civilian rare blood and emergency and international military combat and peacekeeping support use patterns.",M1
20024623,"Structural analysis of red blood cell aggregates under shear flow.A set of measures of red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) aggregates are developed and applied to examine the aggregate structure under plane shear and channel flows. Some of these measures are based on averages over the set of red blood cells which are in contact with each other at a given time. Other measures are developed by first fitting an ellipse to the planar projection of the aggregate, and then examining the area and aspect ratio of the fit ellipse as well as the orientations of constituent RBCs with respect to the fit ellipse axes. The aggregate structural measures are illustrated using a new mesoscale computational model for blood cell transport, collision and adhesion. The sensitivity of this model to change in adhesive surface energy density and shear rate on the aggregate structure is examined. It is found that the mesoscale model predictions exhibit reasonable agreement with experimental and theoretical data for blood flow in plane shear and channel flows. The new structural measures are used to examine the differences between predictions of two- and three-dimensional computations of the aggregate formation, showing that two-dimensional computations retain some of the important aspects of three-dimensional computations.",M1
20018694,"Red blood cell-mimicking synthetic biomaterial particles.Biomaterials form the basis of current and future biomedical technologies. They are routinely used to design therapeutic carriers, such as nanoparticles, for applications in drug delivery. Current strategies for synthesizing drug delivery carriers are based either on discovery of materials or development of fabrication methods. While synthetic carriers have brought upon numerous advances in drug delivery, they fail to match the sophistication exhibited by innate biological entities. In particular, red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>), the most ubiquitous cell type in the human blood, constitute highly specialized entities with unique shape, size, mechanical flexibility, and material composition, all of which are optimized for extraordinary biological performance. Inspired by this natural example, we synthesized particles that mimic the key structural and functional features of RBCs. Similar to their natural counterparts, RBC-mimicking particles described here possess the ability to carry oxygen and flow through capillaries smaller than their own diameter. Further, they can also encapsulate drugs and imaging agents. These particles provide a paradigm for the design of drug delivery and imaging carriers, because they combine the functionality of natural RBCs with the broad applicability and versatility of synthetic drug delivery particles.",M1
20012223,"The consumption of food products from linseed-fed animals maintains erythrocyte omega-3 fatty acids in obese humans.Based on mechanistic and epidemiological data, we raise the question of the relationship between qualitative dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) changes and increase in obesity. In this double-blind trial, we studied the effects on 160 overweight volunteers (body mass index, BMI &gt;30) of a 90 days experimental diet rich principally in animal fat with a low PUFA/saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratio but a low n-6/n-3 ratio, using animal products obtained from linseed-fed animals. The control diet provided less animal fat, a higher PUFA/SFA ratio and a higher n-6/n-3 ratio. Both diets excluded seafood. In the experimental group, we observed a significant increase in red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) alpha-linolenic acid content and a slight increase in EPA and DHA derivatives, while in the control group we observed a significant reduction in EPA and DHA content. Between groups now, the difference in the three n-3 fatty acids changes in RBC was significant. This demonstrates that plasma EPA and DHA levels can be maintained without fish if products from linseed-fed animals are used. During the diets, we noted a significant reduction in weight, BMI and hip circumference within both groups of volunteers. However, no significant difference was observed between the control group and the experimental group. Interestingly, 150 days after the end of the trial (i.e., day 240), we noted a significant weight gain in the control group, whereas no significant weight gain was observed in the experimental group. This was also observed for the BMI and hip circumference. Moreover, significant differences in BMI (P &lt; 0.05) and weight (P = 0.05) appeared between the two groups, showing in both cases a smaller increase in the experimental group. During the 90 days trial, we did not observe any differences between groups in terms of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or triglycerides, suggesting that the saturate content and the P/S ratio are not as important as the n-6 and n-3 fatty acid composition.",M1

Drugs can alter this labeling and modify the disposition of the radiopharmaceuticals. The influence of Rochagan on the labeling of blood constituents with (99m)Tc was reported. Samples of blood were incubated with different concentrations of Rochagan (0%; 6.25%; 12.5%; 25%; 50%; 100%). Stannous chloride and (99m)Tc (3.7MBq/mL) were added. Plasma (P) and (RBC) were isolated and precipitated with thricloroacetic acid 5%. The insoluble (IF) and soluble fractions (SF) were separated. The %ATI in RBC, IF-P and IF-RBC were calculated. The %ATI on RBC decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) from control to all concentrations of Rochagan, respectively: 90.15 + or - 0.14(control) to 70.80 + or - 4.21; to 64.36 + or - 0.33; to 57.30 + or - 1.56; to 50.28 + or - 2.71; to 42.41 + or - 2.24; on IF-RBC, respectively: 84.70 + or - 0.87(control) to 67.16 + or - 4.38; to 63.63 + or - 2.92; to 59.02 + or - 3.17; to 43.75 + or - 1.00; to 24.15 + or - 0.94 and also on IF-P, respectively: 83.46 + or - 1.09(control) to 50.90 + or - 3.36; to 35.46 + or - 4.13; to 35.78 + or - 2.31; to 28.74 + or - 3.09; to 19.66 + or - 1.34.

20003060,"Is red blood cell rheology preserved during routine blood bank storage?BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) units stored for more than 2 weeks at 4 degrees C are currently considered of impaired quality. This opinion has primarily been based on altered RBC rheologic properties (i.e., enhanced aggregability, reduced deformability, and elevated endothelial cell interaction), during prolonged storage of nonleukoreduced RBC units. In this study, the rheologic properties and cell variables of leukoreduced RBC units, during routine blood bank storage in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol, were investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten leukoreduced RBC units were stored at the blood bank for 7 weeks at 4 degrees C. RBCs were tested weekly for aggregability, deformability, and other relevant variables. RESULTS: RBC aggregability was significantly reduced after the first week of storage but recovered during the following weeks. After 7 weeks aggregability was slightly, but significantly, reduced (46.9 + or - 2.4-44.3 + or - 2.2 aggregation index). During storage the osmotic fragility was not significantly enhanced (0.47 + or - 0.01% phosphate-buffered saline) and the deformability at shear stress of 3.9 Pa was not significantly reduced (0.36 + or - 0.01 elongation index [EI]). The deformability at 50 Pa was reduced (0.58 + or - 0.01-0.54 + or - 0.01 EI) but remained within reference values (0.53 + or - 0.04). During 5 weeks of storage, adenosine triphosphate was reduced by 54% whereas mean cell volume, pH, and mean cell hemoglobin concentration were minimally affected. CONCLUSIONS: RBC biochemical and physical alterations during storage minimally affected the RBC ability to aggregate and deform, even after prolonged storage. The rheologic properties of leukoreduced RBC units were well preserved during 7 weeks of routine blood bank storage.",M1

19996520,"Human erythrocyte filterability at low driving pressure.In this study, the human <e>RBC</e> capillary flow has been modeled by passing 11 microl of RBC suspension (Hematocrit = 6%) in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) of a viscosity of 1 and 2.6 cP (in the presence of 2% Dextran) through 5 microm pore diameter polycarbonate Nuclepore filters. We have developed a digitally controlled experimental system for measuring the RBC filterability at a constant driving pressure, in the range of 10-400 Pa, producing a wall shear stress range of 1-50 Pa. The RBC filterability was evaluated by measuring the cell suspension flow rate normalized by the PBS flow rate. The RBC filterability has been found to be a nonlinear function of the driving pressure, having a single minimum locus at 25 Pa. Lowering the driving pressure below 25 Pa revealed an unexpected increase of the RBC filterability.The maximal RBC filterability (near unity) was detected at the lowest driving pressure (10 Pa) and the corresponding estimated RBC linear velocity while traveling through the capillary pore was as high as 800 microm/s. Increasing the driving pressure above 25 Pa confirmed previous results, where RBC filterability is monotonically and asymptotically increasing. Increasing the PBS medium viscosity from 1 to 2.26 cP significantly attenuated the RBC filterability and led to the anomalous increase of RBC deformability at the 10 Pa pressure range. We propose that the anomalous increase in RBC deformability was caused by RBCs undergoing spontaneous mechanical fluctuations.",M1
19996518,"Comparison of three instruments for measuring red blood cell aggregation.The International Society for Clinical Hemorheology organized a workshop to compare three instruments for measuring <e>RBC</e> aggregation: LORCA, Myrenne Aggregometer and RheoScan-A. The Myrenne Aggregometer provides indices at stasis (M) and at low shear (M1), with four indices obtained with the LORCA and RheoScan-A: amplitude (AMP), half-time (T1/2), surface area (SA) above (LORCA) or below (RheoScan-A) the syllectogram, and the ratio (AI) of the area above (LORCA) or below (RheoScan-A) the syllectogram to total area (AI). Intra-assay reproducibility and biological variability were determined; also studied were RBC in diluted plasma and in 1% 500 kDa dextran, and 0.003% glutaradehyde (GA)-treated cells in plasma. All measurements were performed at 37 degrees C. Standardized difference values were used as a measure of power to detect differences. Salient results were: (1) intra-assay variations below 5% except for RheoScan-A AMP and SA; (2) biological variability greatest for T1/2 with other indices similar for the three devices; (3) all instruments detected progressive changes with plasma dilution; (4) the Myrenne and LORCA, but not the RheoScan-A, detected differences for cells in dextran; (5) GA-treatment significantly affected the LORCA (AMP, T1/2, SA, AI), the RheoScan-A (AMP, SA, AI) and the Myrenne M parameter. It is concluded that: (a) the LORCA, Myrenne and the RheoScan-A have acceptable precision and suitable power for detecting reduced aggregation due to plasma dilution; (b) greatly enhanced RBC aggregation may not be sensed by the RheoScan-A while the Myrenne M1 index may be insensitive to minor increases of cell rigidity; (c) future studies should define each instrument's useful range for detecting RBC aggregation.",M1
19995680,"Treatment of whole blood (WB) and red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>) with S-303 inactivates pathogens and retains in vitro quality of stored RBC.A pathogen inactivation (PI) process has been developed using the frangible anchor linker effector (FRALE) compound S-303. A series of experiments were performed in whole blood (WB) to measure the level of viral and bacterial inactivation. The results showed that 0.2mM S-303 and 2mM glutathione (GSH) inactivated &gt;6.5 logs of HIV, &gt;5.7 logs of Bluetongue virus, &gt;7.0 logs of Yersinia enterocolitica, 4.2 logs of Serratia marcescens, and 7.5 logs of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Recent development for S-303 is focused on optimization of the PI process for red blood cell concentrates (RBC). A series of studies in RBC showed that 0.2mM S-303 and 20mM GSH inactivated approximately 5 logs or greater of Y. enterocolitica, E. coli, S. marcescens, S. aureus, HIV, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bluetongue virus and human adenovirus 5. In both applications of the S-303 process, in vitro parameters of RBC function and physiology were retained compared to conventional RBC. Results from these studies indicate that S-303 can be applicable for PI of RBC and WB.",M1
19965624,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand 1 (TRAIL1) enhances the transition of red blood cells from the larval to adult type during metamorphosis in Xenopus.The transition of red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) from primitive to definitive erythropoiesis is conserved across vertebrates. In anuran amphibians, the larval RBCs from primitive erythropoiesis are replaced by adult RBCs from definitive erythropoiesis during metamorphosis. The molecular mechanisms by which the primitive (larval) blood cells are specifically removed from circulation are not yet understood. In this study, we identified Xenopus tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand 1 (xTRAIL1) and xTRAIL2 as ligands of Xenopus death receptor-Ms (xDR-Ms) and investigated whether TRAIL signaling could be involved in this transition. The Trail and xDR-M genes were highly expressed in the liver and RBCs, respectively, during metamorphosis. Interestingly, xTRAIL1 enhanced the transition of the RBCs, and a dominant-negative form of the xTRAIL1 receptor attenuated it, when injected into tadpoles. Moreover, xTRAIL1 induced apoptosis in larval RBCs, but had little effect on adult RBCs in vitro. We also found that adult RBCs treated with staurosporine, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, were sensitized to xTRAIL1. The mRNAs for PKC isoforms were up-regulated in RBCs during metamorphosis. These results suggest that xTRAIL1 can cause apoptosis, probably mediated through xDR-Ms, in larval RBCs, but may not kill adult RBCs, presumably owing to PKC activation, as part of the mechanism for RBC switching.",M1
19965186,"Simulation of erythrocyte deformation in a high shear flow.Deformation of a red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) in a high-shear flow was investigated. The RBC was modeled as a closed shell membrane consisting of spring networks in the framework of the energy minimum concept. The simulation of RBC in a parallel shear flow showed deformation parameters of RBC were well agreed with experimental results. The simulation of RBC behavior in various flow fields demonstrated that the shape was determined not only by instantaneous fluid force acting on it but also its deformation history. No consistency was found between the maximum of the first principal strain and conventionally used hemolysis index. Those results addressed the importance of considering an RBC deformation for accurately predicting hemolysis.",M1
19965026,"Coarse-grained red blood cell model with accurate mechanical properties, rheology and dynamics.We present a coarse-grained red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) model with accurate and realistic mechanical properties, rheology and dynamics. The modeled membrane is represented by a triangular mesh which incorporates shear inplane energy, bending energy, and area and volume conservation constraints. The macroscopic membrane elastic properties are imposed through semi-analytic theory, and are matched with those obtained in optical tweezers stretching experiments. Rheological measurements characterized by time-dependent complex modulus are extracted from the membrane thermal fluctuations, and compared with those obtained from the optical magnetic twisting cytometry results. The results allow us to define a meaningful characteristic time of the membrane. The dynamics of RBCs observed in shear flow suggests that a purely elastic model for the RBC membrane is not appropriate, and therefore a viscoelastic model is required. The set of proposed analyses and numerical tests can be used as a complete model testbed in order to calibrate the modeled viscoelastic membranes to accurately represent RBCs in health and disease.",M1
19963409,"Cellular redox potential and hemoglobin S-glutathionylation in human and rat erythrocytes: A comparative study.The rat is commonly used to evaluate responses of red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) to oxidative stress. How closely the rat RBC model predicts the human RBC human response has not been well characterized. The objective of this study was to compare human and rat RBC responses to the thiol-specific oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide by monitoring the intraerythrocyte glutathione redox potential and its correlation with hemoglobin S-glutathionylation. Changes in redox potential did not differ significantly between rat and human RBCs under the considered conditions, and both human and rat hemoglobins were apparently S-glutathionylated by a thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism with glutathione disulfide, though the extent of S-glutathionylation in rat erythrocytes was more than 10-fold higher than in human ones. On the contrary, human and rat hemoglobin S-glutathionylation differently correlated with redox potential for the glutathione redox couple, suggesting that the formation of S-glutathionylated hemoglobin was not simply a function of glutathione disulfide concentration or glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio and that the content of reactive cysteines in hemoglobin beta globin can strongly influence intraerythrocyte glutathione metabolism and distribution between free and hemoglobin-bound forms. This study reveals fundamental physiological differences in rat and human RBCs because of differences in rat and human beta globin cysteine and reactivity, which can have important implications for the study of rat biology as a whole and for the use of rats as models for human beings under physiological and pathological circumstances and, therefore, highlights the need for caution when extrapolating rat responses to humans.",M1
19962416,"Lipid status, anti-oxidant enzyme defence and haemoglobin content in the blood of long-term clozapine-treated schizophrenic patients.OBJECTIVE: Despite clozapine's unique effectiveness in patients with schizophrenia, a number of adverse effects have been recognised including abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolisms. A high clozapine level in red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) and disturbed anti-oxidant enzyme activities in blood from schizophrenic patients prompted us to investigate lipid status and anti-oxidant enzyme defence in the blood of chronic schizophrenic patients on long-term clozapine therapy. METHODS: Plasma lipids, RBC anti-oxidant enzyme activities and haemoglobin (Hb) content were measured using established procedures in a group of eighteen chronically-medicated (average 630 days of therapy) schizophrenic patients receiving clozapine (average dose of 295 mg/day) and data were compared with those from a group of eighteen well-matched normal controls. RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of plasma triglycerides (by 47%, p&lt;0.01) and total cholesterol and phospholipids (by 8% and 11%, respectively p&lt;0.05) in patients were found. CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) activity was markedly higher (by 35%, p&lt;0.001) while selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px1) activity was markedly lower (by 41%, p&lt;0.001) in patients. In addition, metHb and HbA1c levels in patients were significantly higher (by 58% and 25%, respectively p&lt;0.001). SOD1 activity was negatively correlated (p&lt;0.001) to GSH-Px1 activity in patients. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the view that ongoing oxidative stress may be a mechanism by which clozapine induces some adverse effects that increase the risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. If valid, this would indicate that in parallel with long-term clozapine treatment, schizophrenic patients could be encouraged to make some lifestyle changes to limit the detrimental effects of the medication.",M1
19958781,"Role of the membrane in the formation of heme degradation products in red blood cells.AIMS: Red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) have an extensive antioxidant system designed to eliminate the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nevertheless, RBC oxidant stress has been demonstrated by the formation of a fluorescent heme degradation product (excitation (ex) 321 nm, emission (em) 465 nm) both in vitro and in vivo. We investigated the possibility that the observed heme degradation results from ROS generated on the membrane surface that are relatively inaccessible to the cellular antioxidants. MAIN METHODS: Membrane and cytosol were separated by centrifugation and the fluorescence intensity and emission maximum were measured. The effect on the maximum emission of adding oxidized and reduced hemoglobin to the fluorescent product formed when hemin is degraded by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was studied. KEY FINDINGS: 90% of the fluorescent heme degradation products in hemolysates are found on the membrane. Furthermore, these products are not transferred from the cytosol to the membrane and must, therefore, be formed on the membrane. We also showed that the elevated level of heme degradation in HbCC cells that is attributed to increased oxidative stress was found on the membrane. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that, although ROS generated in the cytosol are neutralized by antioxidant enzymes, H(2)O(2) generated by the membrane bound hemoglobin is not accessible to the cytosolic antioxidants and reacts to generate fluorescent heme degradation products. The formation of H(2)O(2) on the membrane surface can explain the release of ROS from the RBC to other tissues and ROS damage to the membrane that can alter red cell function and lead to the removal of RBCs from circulation by macrophages.",M1
19912115,"Red blood cell storage lesion.The past two decades have witnessed increased scrutiny regarding efficacy and risk of the once unquestioned therapy of red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) transfusion. Simultaneously, a variety of changes have been identified within the RBC and storage media during RBC preservation that are correlated with reduced tissue oxygenation and transfusion-associated adverse effects. These alterations are collectively termed the storage lesion and include extensive biochemical, biomechanical, and immunologic changes involving cells of diverse origin. Time-dependent falls is 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, intracellular RBC adenosine triphosphate, and nitric oxide have been shown to impact RBC deformability and delivery of oxygen to the end-organ. The accumulation of biologic response modifiers such as soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), and Regulated on Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) have been associated with altered recipient immune function as well. This review will address the alterations occurring within the RBC and storage media during RBC preservation and will address the potential clinical consequence thereof.",M1
19952305,"Targeting of a mutant plasminogen activator to circulating red blood cells for prophylactic fibrinolysis.Chemical coupling to carrier red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) converts tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) from a problematic therapeutic into a safe agent for thromboprophylaxis. The goal of this study was to develop a more clinically relevant recombinant biotherapeutic by fusing a mutant tPA with a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) with specificity for glycophorin A (GPA) on mouse RBCs. The fusion construct (anti-GPA scFv/PA) bound specifically to mouse but not human RBCs and activated plasminogen; this led to rapid and stable attachment of up to 30,000 copies of anti-GPA scFv/PA per mouse RBC that were thereby endowed with high fibrinolytic activity. Binding of anti-GPA scFv/PA neither caused RBC aggregation, hemolysis, uptake in capillary-rich lungs or in the reticuloendothelial system nor otherwise altered the circulation of RBCs. Over 40% of labeled anti-GPA scFv/PA injected in mice bound to RBC, which markedly prolonged its intravascular circulation and fibrinolytic activity compared with its nontargeted PA counterpart, anti-GPA scFv/PA, but not its nontargeted PA analog, prevented thrombotic occlusion in FeCl(3) models of vascular injury. These results provide proof-of-principle for the development of a recombinant PA variant that binds to circulating RBC and provides thromboprophylaxis by use of a clinically relevant approach.",M1
19951322,"Prion reduction of red blood cells: impact on component quality.BACKGROUND: A filter has been developed (P-Capt, MacoPharma) to remove infectious prions from red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>). We sought to assess 1) its operational use, 2) the quality of filtered components, and 3) whether filtration resulted in any significant changes to blood group antigens. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 272 leukoreduced RBC units, including units processed using  top-and-top  (TAT) and  bottom-and-top  (BAT) methods, were prion reduced using the P-Capt filter. All RBCs were assessed using standard in vitro tests of RBC quality. Changes to blood group antigen expression were also investigated, including the exposure of cryptantigens and the ability of filtered RBCs to be crossmatched. RESULTS: Ninety-nine percent of TAT units and 58% of BAT units had a hemoglobin (Hb) content of more than 40 g. Hemolysis increased immediately after filtration, but units remained within UK specification throughout storage. Prion reduction resulted in the loss of 7 to 8 g of Hb and reductions in hematocrit of 6% to 9% due to the filter containing 40 mL of saline, adenine, glucose, and mannitol. Other RBC quality data, including extracellular potassium, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, and adenosine triphosphate were similar to historical control data. There was no evidence of any immunologic changes of clinical relevance to the RBC membrane after filtration. CONCLUSIONS: Prion filtration does not appear to have a detrimental effect on basic in vitro measures of RBC quality or on blood group antigens as assessed by in vitro methods. However, prion filtration using the P-Capt filter results in loss of Hb.",M1
19947930,"Comparative NMR studies of diffusional water permeability of red blood cells from different species: XVI Dingo (Canis familiaris dingo) and dog (Canis familiaris).As part of a programme of comparative measurements of Pd (diffusional water permeability) the <e>RBCs</e> (red blood cells) from dingo (Canis familiaris dingo) and greyhound dog (Canis familiaris) were studied. The morphologies of the dingo and greyhound RBCs [examined by light and SEM (scanning electron microscopy)] were found to be very similar, with regard to aspect ratio and size; the mean diameters were estimated to be the same (approximately 7.2 microm) for both dingo and greyhound RBCs. The water diffusional permeability was monitored by using an Mn2+-doping 1H NMR technique at 400 MHz. The Pd (cm/s) values of dingo and greyhound RBCs were similar: 6.5 x 10(-3) at 25 degrees C, 7.5 x 10(-3) at 30 degrees C, 10 x 10(-3) at 37 degrees C and 11.5 x 10(-3) at 42 degrees C. The inhibitory effect of a mercury-containing SH (sulfhydryl)-modifying reagent PCMBS (p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate) was investigated. The maximal inhibition of dingo and greyhound RBCs was reached in 15-30 min at 37 degrees C with 2 mmol/l PCMBS. The values of maximal inhibition were in the range 72-74% when measured at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, and approximately 66% at 37 degrees C. The lowest value of Pd (corresponding to the basal permeability to water) was approximately 2-3 x 10(-3) cm/s in the temperature range 25-37 degrees C. The Ea,d (activation energy of water diffusion) was 25 kJ/mol for dingo RBC and 23 kJ/mol for greyhound RBCs. After incubation with PCMBS, the values of Ea,d increased, reaching 46-48 kJ/mol in the condition of maximal inhibition of water exchange. The electrophoretograms of membrane polypeptides of the dingo and greyhound RBCs were compared and seen to be very similar. We postulate that the RBC parameters reported in the present study are characteristic of all canine species and, in particular in the two cases presented here, these parameters have not been changed by the peculiar Australian habitat over the millennia (as in the case of the dingo) or over shorter time periods, decades or centuries (as in the case of the domestic greyhound).",M1
19942747,"Functional estimation of mannose binding lectin associated serine protease (MBL-MASPs) in human serum.BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Mannose binding lectin (MBL), a C-type or Ca(2+) dependent lectin, plays a major role in lectin pathway of complement activation. MBL deficiency/insufficiency is associated with susceptibility to many infections. It is important to know the association of functional lectin levels with disease condition. Therefore, we carried out this study to develop a simple assay to estimate the functional MBL-associated serine proteases (MBL-MASPs) levels in human serum samples. METHODS: A novel method was developed based on direct haemolysis of mannan coated human erythrocytes in autologous human serum for functional estimation of MBL and associated serine proteases (MBLMASPs complex). Functional MBL-MASPs serum levels in 75 healthy individuals was estimated. Results were compared with those obtained by ELISA based assay. RESULTS: Lysis of mannan coated human <e>RBC</e> in autologous serum was highly specific and mediated by MBL-MASPs lectin complement pathway. Concentration of MBL-MASPs in serum of normal healthy individuals (n=75) was found to be 1.579 mug/ml (median= 1.149 mug/ml) by the haemolytic assay which was comparable to the values obtained by ELISA method. INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the method developed for the estimation of functional MBL-MASPs levels in human serum is simple, cost-effective and comparable with existing ELISA method.",M1
19941843,"Synchrony of G6PD activity and <e>RBC</e> fragility under oxidative stress exerted at normal and G6PD deficiency.OBJECTIVES: To investigative the effects of oxidative stress simultaneously on Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity and RBC fragility under normal and G6PD defective conditions. METHODS: The effects of several nitric oxide (NO) generating compounds and sulfhydryl blocking agents were simultaneously tested in vitro on hemolysate G6PD activities and RBC fragility. These effects were compared between normal subjects and patients with G6PD deficiency. RESULTS: The NO donor compounds nitrosocysteine, nitrosoarginine and diethylamine caused strong inhibition on normal and defective G6PD activities, while a similar inhibition was observed only at higher concentrations of the sulfhydryl blocking agents: 2-mercaptoethanol , cysteine and reduced glutathione. All these oxidative compounds promoted RBC hemolysis in parallel to their inhibition extents on G6PD activities. The protection of RBC from this hemolysis was achieved by preincubation with NADPH or SNP but not NAD(+) compound. CONCLUSION: A concomitant response of G6PD activities and RBC fragility towards the oxidative stress was established.",M1
19939410,"Folate, homocysteine, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alfa levels, but not the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism, are risk factors for schizophrenia.The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation has been associated to high homocysteine levels and schizophrenia. Since cytokines are altered in schizophrenia and increments of homocysteine could promote an inflammatory response, it was investigated whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNFalpha) levels are modulated by the MTHFR genotype. Serum levels of TNFalpha, IL-6, B(12), homocysteine, folate and red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) folate as well as the MTHFR genotype were determined in a group of schizophrenic patients and compared to those of a control group. RBC folate levels were reduced and homocysteine and the two cytokines' concentrations were elevated in all patients as compared to controls. RBC folate in both heterozygous (CT) and homozygous (TT) patients was significantly different to that of their respective control groups. Homocysteine levels found in patients were significantly higher than those found in controls, only in individuals carrying the TT genotype. Cytokine levels were augmented in the group of patients irrespective of the genotype, and significant differences were found in all cases, except for TNFalpha levels in those subjects carrying the CC genotype. After adjusting for sex, low levels of RBC folate, high levels of homocysteine, both medium and high levels of TNFalpha and high IL-6 levels were associated with schizophrenia. MTHFR genotype was not a risk factor for developing the disease, although a larger sample is required to confirm this finding.",M1
19934164,"Time-course, dose-response, and age comparative sensitivity of N-methyl carbamates in rats.N-Methyl carbamate insecticides are reversible inhibitors of central and peripheral acetylcholinesterase (ChE). Despite their widespread use, there are few studies of neurotoxicity in young animals. To study potential age-related differences, we evaluated seven carbamates (carbaryl, carbofuran, formetanate, methiocarb, methomyl, oxamyl, and propoxur) in preweanling (17 days old or postnatal day [PND] 17) male rats. Motor activity was monitored, and ChE inhibition was measured in brain and red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) using a radiometric assay that minimized reactivation of ChE. First, we conducted time-course studies in PND17 Long-Evans male rats, using a single oral dose of each carbamate. Almost all carbamates showed maximal ChE inhibition at a 45-min time point; only methomyl showed an earlier peak effect (15 min). At 24 h, most inhibition had recovered. Next, dose-response data were collected for each carbamate, using four doses and control, with motor activity testing beginning 15 min after dosing and tissue collection at 40-45 min. RBC ChE was generally inhibited to a greater degree than brain. Motor activity was not as sensitive a measure for some of the carbamates, with some differences across carbamates in the shapes of the dose-response curves. Additional studies documented age-related differences by comparing ChE inhibition in PND11, PND17, and adult rats following administration of carbaryl or carbofuran. Only the youngest (PND11) rats were more sensitive than adults to carbaryl, but both younger ages showed more effects than adults with carbofuran. Comparisons of the other carbamates to previous studies in adult rats suggest similar age-related sensitivity. Thus, these data show the time-course and dose-response characteristics for each carbamate and document greater sensitivity of the young for carbofuran and carbaryl.",M1

Once B-cell tolerance checkpoints are bypassed, the patient loses self-tolerance, if the AIHA is not also caused by an possible variety of secondary pathogenic events such as viral, neoplastic and underlying autoimmune entities, such as SLE or post-transplantation drawbacks; treatment of underlying diseases in secondary AIHA guides ways to curative AIHA treatment.

In particular, we describe the current models accounting for RBC aging and response to lethal stresses, review the published proteomic studies carried out to uncover the molecular basis of the RBC storage lesion, and conclude by suggesting a few possible proteomic studies that would provide further knowledge of the molecular alterations carried by RBCs stored in the cold for six weeks.",M1
19929721,"Parameterization of red blood cell elongation index--shear stress curves obtained by ektacytometry.Measurement of red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) deformability by ektacytometry yields a set of elongation indexes (EI) measured at various shear stresses (SS) presented as SS-EI curves, or tabulated data. These are useful for detailed analysis, but may not be appropriate when a simple comparison of a global parameter between groups is required. Based on the characteristic shape of SS-EI curves, two approaches have been proposed to calculate the maximal RBC elongation index (EI(max)) and the shear stress required for one-half of this maximal deformation (SS(1/2)): (i) linear Lineweaver-Burke (LB) model; (ii) Streekstra-Bronkhorst (SB) model. Both approaches have specific assumptions and thus may be subject to the measurement conditions. Using RBC treated with various concentrations of glutaraldehyde (GA) and data obtained by ektacytometry, the two approaches have been compared for nine different ranges of SS between 0.6-75 Pa. Our results indicate that: (i) the sensitivity of both models can be affected by the SS range and limits employed; (ii) over the entire range of SS-data, a non-linear curve fitting approach to the LB model gave more consistent results than a linear approach; (iii) the LB method is better for detecting SS(1/2) differences between RBC treated with 0.001-0.005% glutaraldehyde (GA) and for a 40% mixture of rigid cells but is equally sensitive to SB for 10% rigid cells; and (iv) the LB and SB methods for EI(max) are equivalent for 0.001% and 0.003% GA and 40% rigid, with the SB better for 0.005% GA and the LB better for 10% rigid.",M1
19929473,"A new automatic device for routine cord blood banking: critical analysis of different volume reduction methodologies.BACKGROUND AIMS: Volume reduction is the usual process in cord blood banking that has some advantages regarding reducing the storage space and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) quantity in the final product. The volume reduction methodology must guarantee high cell recovery and red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) depletion by reducing all the umbilical cord blood (UCB) units to a standard volume. METHODS: We analyzed and compared critically three different volume reduction methods [hydroxyethylstarch (HES), top and bottom with Optipress II and Compomat G4, and AXP] used at the Valencia Cord Blood Bank over 10 years. RESULTS: The highest significant RBC depletion was achieved with the AXP system (P&lt;0.001), while the top and bottom system with Compomat G4 and an adjusted buffy coat (BC) volume to 41 mL enabled the best total nucleated cell (TNC) recovery (P&lt;0.001). TNC recovery and RBC depletion were similar for AXP and HES with an adjusted volume to 21 mL. In the multivariate analysis, when analyzing all cases, the BC volume set significantly influenced TNC, CD34+ and lymphocyte recoveries and RBC depletion (P&lt;0.001). RBC depletion was significantly influenced by the initial volume and initial RBC content of UCB units (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: AXP is a highly efficient method for RBC depletion, providing the same TNC recovery as HES method with a final volume of 41 mL. AXP has the advantages of being an automatic and functionally closed system that shortens and better standardizes the proceedings. Top and bottom is a closed system that allows better TNC recoveries when the BC volume set is 41 mL.",M1
19927622,"Southeast Asian ovalocytosis is associated with increased expression of Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC).The Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC or Fy glycoprotein) carries antigens that are important in blood transfusion and is the main receptor used by Plasmodium vivax to invade reticulocytes. Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) results from an alteration in <e>RBC</e> membrane protein band 3 and is thought to mitigate susceptibility to falciparum malaria. Expression of some RBC antigens is suppressed by SAO, and we hypothesized that SAO may also reduce Fy expression, potentiallyleading to reduced susceptibility to vivax malaria. Blood samples were collected from individuals living in the Madang Province of Papua New Guinea. Samples were assayed using a flow cytometry assay for expression of Fy on the surface of RBC and reticulocytes by measuring the attachment of a phycoerythrin-labeled Fy6 antibody. Reticulocytes were detected using thiazole orange. The presence of the SAO mutation was confirmed by PCR. There was a small (approximately 10%) but statistically significant (p=0.049, Mann-Whitney U test) increase in Fy expression on SAO RBC compared with RBC from individuals without this polymorphism: mean Fy expression (mean fluorescence intensity [MFI]) was 10.12 +/- 1.22 for SAO heterozygotes versus an MFI of 8.95 +/- 1.1 for individuals without SAO. For reticulocytes the MFI values were 27.61 +/- 19.12 for SAO heterozygotes and 16.47 +/- 3.81 for controls. SAO is associated with increased and not decreased Fy6 expression so that susceptibility to P. vivax infection is unlikely to be affected.",M1
19925209,"The microvascular impact of focal nerve trunk injury.The microvascular supply of the peripheral nerve trunk may be rendered vulnerable by acute focal injuries, particularly if they are associated with direct injury to the epineurial blood supply. In this work we tracked the impact of three clinically relevant forms of focal nerve trunk injury on serial measures of epineurial weighted erythrocyte flux and endoneurial blood flow: short-length crush injuries, long-segmental crush injuries, and crush injuries with superimposed vascular stripping to model added direct epineurial damage. Red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) flux was measured using quantitative multiple sampling laser doppler flowmetry, and endoneurial blood flow by microelectrode hydrogen clearance polarography. Both short and long crush injuries transiently reduced epineurial RBC flux, most prominently in long injuries, to 34% by 1 h after injury. The changes were less prominent when deeper flux was examined, whereas endoneurial blood flow was not altered by either injury. Long crush injury with added stripping of the epineurial blood supply was associated with more profound declines in epineurial RBC flux, to 16% by 3 h, with recovery at 14 days to 70% of that of the contralateral intact nerve trunk. There was, however, only a minimal impact on endoneurial flow: mild reductions immediately and at 1 h after injury, with rebound hyperemia by 48 h. Despite the presence of prominent epineurial ischemia, regenerative sprouting was not impaired by longer segmental injuries with or without epineurial vascular stripping. Axon sprouting was more prominent in both of these types of injuries compared to short-crush lesions. Taken together, these results indicate that focal nerve trunk injury is remarkably resistant to endoneurial ischemia, and that it can sustain regenerative sprouting in spite of prolonged alterations in the epineurial circulation. Approaches to augment epineurial microvascular viability after nerve injury may not support better regeneration.",M1
19923794,"Effect of iron chelators on labile iron and oxidative status of thalassaemic erythroid cells.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Iron accumulation in vital organs such as heart and liver is a major pathology in beta-thalassaemia. It may also affect mature <e>RBCs</e> and developing erythroid precursors. The cellular damage is mainly caused by the labile iron pool (LIP) and is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). We have previously shown that thalassaemic RBCs and their precursors have more LIP and ROS than their normal counterparts. We now report the effect of clinically relevant iron chelators on these parameters. METHODS: RBCs, reticulocytes and cultured erythroid precursors derived from patients with beta-thalassaemia were studied for LIP and oxidative stress parameters by flow-cytometry. RESULTS: In vitro treatment with deferiprone, deferasirox and deferoxamine reduced the cytosolic LIP in RBCs and reticulocytes, and both the cytosolic and mitochondrial LIP in cultured erythroid precursors. This was associated with reduced oxidative stress (ROS and external phosphatidylserine). While the effect of deferiprone and deferasirox was fast (within 10 min), deferoxamine affected these parameters after 24 h, suggesting a slower rate of entry. CONCLUSION: The chelators studied reduce the LIP and the oxidative status of thalassaemic RBC and their precursors. Whether these effects directly improve ineffective erythropoiesis and RBC survival remains to be shown.",M1
19923692,"Extra- and intracellular signaling pathways under red blood cell aggregation and deformability changes.Exposure of red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) to catecholamines (epinephrine, phenylephrine, an agonist of alpha1-adrenergic receptors, clonidine, an agonist of alpha2-adrenergic receptors and isoproterenol, an agonist of beta-adrenergic receptors) led to change in the RBC microrheological properties. When forskolin (10 microM), an AC stimulator was added to RBC suspension, the RBC deformability (RBCD) was increased by 17% (p&lt;0.05). Somewhat more significant deformability rise appeared after RBC incubation with dB-AMP (by 27%; p&lt;0.01). Red blood cell aggregation (RBCA) was significantly decreased under these conditions (p&lt;0.01). All drugs having PDE activity increased red cell deformability similarly. Some more changes of deformability was found after RBC incubation with pentoxifylline--25% (p&lt;0.05) and IBMX incubation was accompanied only by 15% rise of RBC deformability. The drugs with PDE inhibitory activity reduced red cell aggregation. The most significant RBCA reduction effect was found under cell incubation with pentoxifylline and inhibitor PDE1-vinpocetine. On the whole RBCA reduction averaged 36% (p&lt;0.05) under RBCs incubation with PDE inhibitors. The rise of Ca2+ influx, stimulated by A23187, was accompanied by an increase of RBCA, whereas red cell deformability was changed insignificantly. At the same time Ca2+ entry blocking into the red cells by verapamil or its chelating in medium by EGTA led to significant RBCA decrease and deformability rise (p&lt;0.05).On the whole the total data clearly show that the red cell aggregation and deformation changes were connected with an activation of the different intracellular signaling pathways. It seems reasonable to suppose that RBCA decrease was mainly associated with an activation of the adenylyl-cyclase-cAMP system, while the red cell deformability was closely associated with Ca2+ control mechanisms.",M1
19923368,"Linoleic acid is associated with lower long-chain n-6 and n-3 fatty acids in red blood cell lipids of Canadian pregnant women.BACKGROUND: Arachidonic (ARA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids are important in membrane glycerophospholipids. Higher maternal blood ARA, EPA, and DHA concentrations in gestation are associated with higher maternal-to-fetal transfer of ARA, EPA, and DHA, respectively, which emphasizes the importance of maternal fatty acid status in gestation. As in the brain, red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) ethanolamine phosphoglycerides (EPGs) are high in plasmalogen, ARA, and DHA. OBJECTIVE: We determined the relation between dietary n-6 (omega-6) and n-3 (omega-3) fatty acid intakes and n-6 and n-3 fatty acids in RBC EPGs and phosphatidylcholine in near-term pregnant women. DESIGN: The subjects were 105 healthy Canadian pregnant (36 wk gestation) women. Fatty acid intakes were estimated by food-frequency questionnaire, and fasting venous blood samples were collected. RESULTS: DHA and EPA intakes were positively associated with RBC EPG and phosphatidylcholine concentrations of DHA (rho = 0.309 and 0.369, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) and EPA (rho = 0.391 and 0.228, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) and inversely associated with RBC EPG 22:4n-6 and 22:5n-6 (P &lt; 0.001). In RBCs, concentrations of linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) were inversely associated with DHA, EPA, and ARA, respectively, in EPGs (r = -0.432, P &lt; 0.01; r = -0.201, P &lt; 0.04; and r = -0.303, P &lt; 0.01) and phosphatidylcholine (r = -0.460, -0.490, and -0.604; P &lt; 0.01 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Membrane fatty acids are influenced by the amount and balance of fatty acid substrates. Our results suggest the competitive interaction of LA with ARA, EPA, and DHA, with no evidence that higher LA increases ARA. Biochemical indicators to suggest that DHA is limiting are present in our population. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00620672.",M1
19917536,"Spanish Society of Medical Oncology consensus on the use of erythropoietic stimulating agents in anaemic cancer patients.Treatment of anaemia is a very important aspect in the management of cancer patients. In order to carry out a consensus process about the use of erythropoietic stimulating agents (ESAs) in cancer patients, the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM) elaborated a working group which coordinated a panel of medical oncology specialists. This working group has reviewed the main issues about the use of ESAs. In addition a consensus meeting was held in Madrid on 25 April 2007. The following conclusions were made: Since ESA treatment increases the haemoglobin (Hb) level and decreases the red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) transfusion requirements, ESAs should be used within the approved indications in patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment, beginning at a Hb level below 11 g/dl and maintaining it around 12 g/dl, with iron supplements if necessary. Neither increasing the ESA dose in nonresponders nor the use of ESAs in the treatment of chronic cancer-related anaemia is recommended.",M1
19914412,"In vivo pharmaco-proteomic analysis of hydroxyurea induced changes in the sickle red blood cell membrane proteome.Hydroxyurea (HU) is an effective drug for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD). The main clinical benefit of HU is thought to derive from its capacity to increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production. However, other effects leading to clinical benefit, such as improved blood rheology, have been suggested. In order to understand HU-induced changes at the proteomic level, we profiled sickle <e>RBC</e> membranes from of HU-treated and untreated patients. Our previous in vitro profiling studies on sickle RBC membranes identified a significant increase in predominantly anti-oxidant enzymes, protein repair and degradation components and a few RBC cytoskeletal proteins. In the present study, using 2D-DIGE (Two-Dimensional Difference In-Gel Electrophoresis) and tandem mass spectrometry, we detected 32 different proteins that significantly changed in abundance in the HU treatment group. The proteins that significantly increased in abundance were mostly membrane skeletal components involved in the regulation of RBC shape and flexibility, and those showing a significant decrease were components of the protein repair and degradation machinery. RBC palmitoylated membrane protein 55 (p55) is significantly increased in abundance at low (in vitro) and high (in vivo) concentrations of HU. Palmitoylated p55 may be an important target of HU-dependent regulation of the sickle RBC membrane, consistent with our earlier in vitro studies.",M1
19909787,"Impaired transmethylation potential in Parkinson's disease patients treated with L-Dopa.Hyperhomocysteinaemia was reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with l-Dopa. The increase in plasma concentration of this sulfur compound arises from the massive methylation of the drug operated by the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which acts as a powerful sink of methyl groups. The contemporary occurrence of C677T polymorphism in homozygosity, leading to a temperature-labile variant of the MTHFR enzyme, induces an even more marked increase in tHcy. Here we show that l-Dopa administration in hyperhomocysteinemic PD patients is able to lower intracellular concentration of S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in erythrocytes (<e>RBC</e>), while the occurrence of hyperhomocysteinaemia causes a significant increase in S-Adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) level. In patients with PD treated with l-Dopa and hyperhomocysteinemic, the remarkable decrease in AdoMet and the concurrent increase in AdoHcy concentration both contribute to significantly lower the transmethylation potential ([AdoMet]/[AdoHcy]), a useful index of the effectiveness of methyl group transfer by methyltransferases. This decrease could indeed contribute to partly attenuate, through a self-limiting kinetic mechanism, the tendency of developing drug resistance, partly mediated in these patients by COMT upregulation. Our results also support the conclusion that COMT inhibitors (entacapone or tolcapone), when administered in PD patients treated with l-Dopa, may potentiate the endogenous AdoHcy-dependent COMT inhibition mechanism already operative in a variable fashion.",M1
19907156,"Fragmentation of human erythrocyte actin following exposure to hypoxia.In a comparative study on erythrocytes (<e>RBCs</e>) drawn from mountaineers before and after a high-altitude stay, we observed that upon returning to sea level, their RBCs displayed a senescent-like phenotype as indicated by their density and the partial loss of membrane proteins which are shed by ageing RBCs. The aim of this study was to investigate possible changes in the membrane skeleton of these RBCs and to compare them with pathological RBCs. We analysed the proteins of RBC ghosts obtained from our subjects before and after returning to sea level by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. We observed lower expression and fragmentation of beta-actin after exposure to hypoxia. This suggested an alteration in membrane skeleton structure, which was confirmed by beta-actin release in cell lysates during ghost preparation. We observed a similar actin fragmentation and release in RBC lysates from beta-thalassaemic patients. In conclusion, these results indicate that after exposure to hypoxia, RBCs display a modification of their actin and cytoskeleton instability.",M1
19904335,"Determination of cell elasticity through hybrid ray optics and continuum mechanics modeling of cell deformation in the optical stretcher.The optical stretcher is a dual-beam trap capable of stretching individual cells. Previous studies have used either ray- or wave-optical models to compute the optical pressure on the surface of a spherical cell. We have extended the ray-optics model to account for focusing by the spherical interface and the effects of multiple internal reflections. Simulation results for red-blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) show that internal reflections can lead to significant perturbation of the deformation, leading to a systematic error in the determination of cellular elasticity. Calibration studies show excellent agreement between the predicted and measured escape force, and RBC stiffness measurements are consistent with literature values. Measurements of the elasticity of murine osteogenic cells reveal that these cells are approximately 5.4 times stiffer than RBCs.",M1
19895145,"Photometric measurements of red blood cell aggregation: light transmission versus light reflectance.Red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) aggregation is the reversible and regular clumping in the presence of certain macromolecules. This is a clinically important phenomenon, being significantly enhanced in the presence of acute phase reactants (e.g., fibrinogen). Both light reflection (LR) and light transmission (LT) from or through thin layers of RBC suspensions during the process of aggregation are accepted to reflect the time course of aggregation. It has been recognized that the time courses of LR and LT might be different from each other. We aim to compare the RBC aggregation measurements based on simultaneous recordings of LR and LT. The results indicate that LR during RBC aggregation is characterized by a faster time course compared to simultaneously recorded LT. This difference in time course of LR and LT is reflected in the calculated parameters reflecting the overall extent and kinetics of RBC aggregation. Additionally, the power of parameters calculated using LR and LT time courses in detecting a given difference in aggregation are significantly different from each other. These differences should be taken into account in selecting the appropriate calculated parameters for analyzing LR or LT time courses for the assessment of RBC aggregation.",M1
19890898,"HLA alloimmunization is associated with <e>RBC</e> antibodies in multiply transfused patients with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Alloimmunization to minor red blood cell (RBC) antigens occurs commonly in sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with alloimmunization demonstrate increased risk for new alloantibody formation with subsequent transfusion. Alloimmunization to human leukocyte antigens (HLA) can occur with RBC transfusion and may result in graft rejection during stem cell or organ transplantation. The prevalence and risk factors for HLA alloimmunization in multiply transfused pediatric SCD patients are unknown. PROCEDURE: A cross-sectional study of HLA alloimmunization in SCD patients aged 3-21 years with a history of &gt;or=3 RBC transfusions was performed to test the hypothesis that HLA alloimmunization is associated with RBC alloimmunization. Antibodies to class I and class II HLA were measured by Flow Panel Reactive Antibody (FlowPRA). RESULTS: Seventy-three SCD patients (30 with RBC antibodies) were tested. HLA antibodies were detected in 25/73 (34%) patients; class I HLA antibodies occurred in 24/73 (33%) and class II HLA antibodies occurred in 3 (4%). Among patients with RBC antibodies, 16/30 (53%) had HLA antibodies, while 9/43 (21%) patients without RBC antibodies had HLA antibodies (OR 4.32 [1.6-12.1]). In a multivariate analysis, antibodies to RBC antigens were an independent predictor of HLA alloimmunization (P = 0.041). The association of RBC and HLA immunization was strongest among patients with no history of chronic transfusion therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis is the first description of HLA alloimmunization in pediatric SCD patients who receive primarily leukoreduced RBC transfusions and demonstrates that HLA alloimmunization tendency is associated with antibodies to RBC antigens.",M1
19882755,"Toxic effects of Litsea elliptica Blume essential oil on red blood cells of Sprague-Dawley rats.Litsea elliptica Blume leaves have been traditionally used as medicinal herbs because of its antimutagenicity, chemopreventative and insecticidal properties. In this study, the toxic effects of L. elliptica essential oil against Sprague-Dawley rat's red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) were evaluated. L. elliptica essential oil was given by oral gavage 5 times per week for 3 treated groups in the doses of 125, 250, and 500 mg/(kg body weight), respectively, and the control group received distilled water. Full blood count, RBC osmotic fragility, RBC morphological changes, and RBC membrane lipid were analyzed 28 d after the treatment. Although L. elliptica essential oil administration had significantly different effects on hemoglobin (Hb), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean cell volume (MCV), and mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) in the experimental groups as compared to the control group (P&lt;0.05), the values were still within the normal range. L. elliptica induced morphological changes of RBC into the form of echinocyte. The percentage of echinocyte increased significantly among the treated groups in a dose-response manner (P&lt;0.001). The concentrations of RBC membrane phospholipids and cholesterol of all treated groups were significantly lower than those of control group (P&lt;0.001). However, the RBC membrane osmotic fragility and total proteins of RBC membrane findings did not differ significantly between control and treated groups (P&gt;0.05). It is concluded that structural changes in the RBC membrane due to L. elliptica essential oil administration did not cause severe membrane damage.",M1
19882684,"In vitro inhibition of fungal activity by macrophage-mediated sequestration and release of encapsulated amphotericin B nanosupension in red blood cells.The efficacy of antifungal treatment has been diminished by the biodistribution limitations of amphotericin B (AmB) due to its pharmacological profile, as well as the severe side effects it causes. A cellular drug-delivery system, which incorporates human erythrocytes (<e>RBCs</e>) loaded with an AmB nanosuspension (AmB-NS), is developed in order to improve antifungal treatment. AmB-NS encapsulation in RBCs is achieved by using hypotonic hemolysis, leading to intracellular AmB amounts of 3.81 +/- 0.47 pg RBC(-1) and an entrapment efficacy of 15-18%. Upon phagocytosis of AmB-NS-RBCs, leukocytes show a slow AmB release over ten days, and no alteration in cell viability. This results in an immediate, permanent inhibition of intra- and extracellular fungal activity. AmB-NS-RBC-leukocyte-mediated delivery of AmB is efficient in amounts 1000 times lower than the toxic dose. This drug-delivery method is effective for the transport of water-insoluble substances, such as AmB, and this warrants consideration for further testing.",M1

Currently, laboratories also need to accredit their urine diagnostics by comparing their measurement methods to acceptable references. In this study we compared particle counts obtained by new generation automated technique, image capture analysis (IQ-200) with those of a standardized chamber counts. DESIGN AND METHODS: The same 258 urine samples from different departments of a hospital assayed by IQ-200 were analyzed in parallel with the KOVA cell chamber system. Clinically significant discrepancy results (positive vs. negative) for red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) and white blood cell (WBC) were also compared with those obtained by dipstick testing. RESULTS: There was a good agreement between the automated system and sediment microscopy for RBCs, WBCs, and squamous epithelial cells (SCs) (r=0.90; r=0.80; r=0.72, respectively: P&lt;0.001). The IQ-200 was more sensitive for determining RBCs, WBCs, and SCs than other formed elements. CONCLUSIONS: IQ-200 can perform accurate quantification of microscopic element in urine. However, automated techniques are not completely free of error. Therefore, by adopting an appropriate algorithm and combining the results with stript analysis and other laboratory tests allows further reduction of clinically important errors.",M2
20110105,"Decline of the red blood cell count in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer: impact of ADT on insulin-like growth factor-1 and erythropoiesis.OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the mechanism of blood hemoglobin loss in patients with prostate cancer during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and to examine the activity of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis during ADT, which plays an important role in hematopoiesis. METHODS: A total of 83 patients with localized prostate cancer, who received ADT, were prospectively studied on the basis of their blood samples at the baseline and after ADT for 6 months. RESULTS: Before ADT, the IGF-1 level was correlated with the red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) count (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis [rs]=0.315, P=.011), hemoglobin (rs=0.278, P=.018), and mean corpuscular volume (rs=0.266, P=.020), but such relationships disappeared after ADT. After ADT, the serum IGF-1 level increased compared with that at the baseline (21+/-6 vs 18+/-5 nmol/L, respectively, P&lt;.001), but no change was observed in the serum GH level (P=.691). There was no difference between erythropoietin and interleukin-6 concentrations before and after ADT (P=.852 and P=.208, respectively). The hemoglobin concentration and RBC count declined after ADT compared with those before treatment (P&lt;.001 for each). Although the mean corpuscular volume declined after ADT (P=.002), the mean cell hemoglobin was comparable between before and after ADT (P=.676). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the unaffected GH, erythropoietin, and interleukin-6 levels, the serum IGF-1 concentration was elevated by ADT. Even with the increased IGF-1 level, the RBC count and hemoglobin concentration declined after ADT. IGF-1 in the bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells might be functionally inactivated during ADT.",M2
20061240,"Inflammatory and haematotoxic potential of indoor Stachybotrys chartarum (Ehrenb.) Hughes metabolites.Mould Stachybotrys chartarum (Ehrenb.) Hughes is known to pose a health risk in indoor environments. Most of its strains can produce several intra- and extracellular trichothecene mycotoxins. Complex secondary metabolites of stachybotrys isolates from mouldy dwellings/public buildings in Slovakia were intratracheally instilled in Wistar male rats (4 microg in 0.2 mL of 0.2 % dimethylsulphoxide; diacetoxyscirpenol as the positive control). After three days, haematological parameters were measured in peripheral blood and inflammatory response biomarkers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the results were statistically analysed. Exometabolites proved to suppress red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>), decreasing the total RBC count, haemoglobin, and haematocrit. The exposed rats showed significantly higher total BALF cell count, indicating inflammation, lower alveolar macrophage counts, and increased granulocyte count related to the BALF cells. Due to haematotoxic and inflammation-inducing properties, metabolites of S. chartarum can cause damage to the airways and haematological disorders in occupants of mouldy buildings.",M2
20003225,"An experimental assessment of in silico haplotype association mapping in laboratory mice.BACKGROUND: To assess the utility of haplotype association mapping (HAM) as a quantitative trait locus (QTL) discovery tool, we conducted HAM analyses for red blood cell count (<e>RBC</e>) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) in mice. We then experimentally tested each HAM QTL using published crosses or new F2 intercrosses guided by the haplotype at the HAM peaks. RESULTS: The HAM for RBC, using 33 classic inbred lines, revealed 8 QTLs; 2 of these were true positives as shown by published crosses. A HAM-guided (C57BL/6J x CBA/J)F2 intercross we carried out verified 2 more as true positives and 4 as false positives. The HAM for HDL, using 81 strains including recombinant inbred lines and chromosome substitution strains, detected 46 QTLs. Of these, 36 were true positives as shown by published crosses. A HAM-guided (C57BL/6J x A/J)F2 intercross that we carried out verified 2 more as true positives and 8 as false positives. By testing each HAM QTL for RBC and HDL, we demonstrated that 78% of the 54 HAM peaks were true positives and 22% were false positives. Interestingly, all false positives were in significant allelic association with one or more real QTL. CONCLUSION: Because type I errors (false positives) can be detected experimentally, we conclude that HAM is useful for QTL detection and narrowing. We advocate the powerful and economical combined approach demonstrated here: the use of HAM for QTL discovery, followed by mitigation of the false positive problem by testing the HAM-predicted QTLs with small HAM-guided experimental crosses.",M2

19725594,"Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the erythropoietin Mimetibody construct CNTO 528 in healthy subjects.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Anaemia is a serious comorbidity that is common in patients with renal failure or cancer. CNTO 528 is the first Mimetibody developed to mimic the effects of erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>). The objective of this study was to develop a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model for CNTO 528 in healthy male subjects. METHODS: A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for CNTO 528 was developed to describe the serum concentration versus time profile and the pharmacological responses of percentage of reticulocytes, total RBC counts and haemoglobin concentration after a single intravenous administration of CNTO 528 at 0.03, 0.09, 0.3 and 0.9 mg/kg in 24 healthy subjects. An open, linear, two-compartment model was used to characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters of CNTO 528. A catenary cell production and lifespan loss model was used to fit the pharmacodynamic data, yielding estimates of drug potency (SC(50)), efficacy (S(max)) and other pharmacodynamic parameters. Bootstrap and posterior predictive checks (PPC) were used to evaluate the model. RESULTS: Administration of CNTO 528 stimulated the production of reticulocytes, RBCs and haemoglobin. CNTO 528 exhibits a half-life of 141 hours, or approximately 5.9 days. The SC(50) was estimated to be 0.37 mg/L, indicating that low serum CNTO 528 concentration was sufficient to produce pharmacological effects. Compared with historical controls, CNTO 528 S(max) appears to be 2-fold higher than recombinant human EPO. Bootstrap analysis and PPCs confirmed the accuracy and precision in the parameter estimates and the adequacy of the model to describe the CNTO 528 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. CONCLUSION: The mechanistic population model was suitable to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenously administered CNTO 528 in healthy subjects. This qualified model is deemed appropriate to conduct clinical trial simulations and to support the decision-making process for dose selection in studies of EPO-stimulating agents.",M2
19682344,"Liver donor's age and recipient's serum creatinine predict blood component use during liver transplantation.BACKGROUND: Excessive use of blood components during liver transplantation should be avoided because it has been associated with poor outcomes and it may stress blood bank resources. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine preoperative predictors of excessive transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver transplantation, the clinical records of 126 consecutive adult patients undergoing primary liver transplantation were retrospectively reviewed. Outcome variables included number of red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>), plasma, and plateletpheresis components intraoperatively transfused. Univariate analyses of the following predictor variables were performed: recipient age, sex, ethnicity, height/weight, Model for End Stage Liver Disease score, year of transplant, previous abdominal surgery, hepatoma, wait-list time, standard recipient laboratory values obtained immediately before transplantation, cold ischemia time, donor age, sex, and height/weight. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression was used to build a model that best predicted how many blood components should be available before transplant. RESULTS: Donor age of more than 50 years old (odds ratio [OR], 2.8 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-6.0), and recipient serum creatinine (SCr) level of more than 1.3 mg/dL (OR, 3.8 95% CI, 1.6-8.9) were the only variables found to be predictive of RBC use in multivariate analysis. This model accurately predicted the use of more than 10 units of RBCs 79% of cases. Having both adverse factors present resulted in using more than one box in 80% of cases as compared to 44% of cases where only one or no adverse factor was present (p = 0.002). Further analyses showed a direct correlation between the number of RBCs transfused and plasma (r = 0.93) and plateletpheresis components (r = 0.74) transfused. [Corrections added after online publication 22-Jul-2009: OR updated from 3.8 to 2.8; CI from 1.6-8.9 to 1.3-6.0; OR from 2.8-3.8.] CONCLUSION: Liver donor's age and recipient's SCr are important in preoperatively predicting blood use during liver transplantation.",M2
19673078,"Intraperitoneal injection of extracted microcystins results in hypovolemia and hypotension in crucian carp (Carassius auratus).Circulatory responses of crucian carp injected intraperitoneally with extracted microcystins (MCs) were studied at sublethal and lethal doses (150 and 600 microg MC kg(-1) body mass, respectively). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate, hematocrit (Hct), red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) counts, and circulating blood volume (BV) were assayed at 0, 1, 3, 12, 24, and 48 h post-toxin administration. MAP decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner over time. Within the 48-h test period, the lethal dose as well as the sublethal dose resulted in a steady decline of MAP without recovery. Heart rate significantly increased within 24 h post-injection as blood pressure significantly dropped, then showed a terminal decline to the control level. The dose-dependent decreases in BV and Hct were directly related to the drop in MAP. Intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of MCs led to hepatic and gill hemorrhage. Consequently, crucian carp given MCs suffered from hypovolemic hypotensive shock.",M2
19651194,"Long-term intake of a high zinc diet causes iron deficiency anemia accompanied by reticulocytosis and extra-medullary erythropoiesis.To elucidate the pathophysiology of zinc (Zn)-induced iron (Fe) deficiency anemia (IDA), we examined hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations, hematocrit (Ht) levels, numbers of circulating red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>) and reticulocytes, values of mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), serum Zn, Fe and erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations and histopathological changes in the bone marrow, spleen and liver using rats fed with a standard or high Zn diet for 20 weeks. Rats fed with the high Zn diet exhibited a significant decrease in Hb concentrations, Ht levels and MCV, MCH and MCHC values, indicating microcytic hypochromic anemia characterized by Fe deficiency. Also, a marked decrease in serum Fe concentrations was seen in rats fed with the high Zn diet relative to rats fed with the standard diet. Interestingly, the number of RBC was comparable in both groups of rats, although a decrease in the number of RBC is ordinarily seen in IDA. There were reticulocytosis and extra-medullary erythropoiesis in the spleen and an increase in serum EPO concentrations in rats fed with the high Zn diet vs. those on the standard diet. These observations suggest that both reticulocytosis and extra-medullary erythropoiesis in the spleen played a role in maintaining the number of RBC in rats fed with the high Zn diet, preventing further progression of anemia. Further, increased production of EPO may be involved in the induction of reticulocytosis and extra-medullary erythropoiesis in the spleen.",M2
19622625,"Association of hematological parameters with insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in nondiabetic subjects.OBJECTIVE: Previous studies reported independent associations of hematological parameters with risk of incident type 2 diabetes, although limited data are available on associations of these parameters with insulin resistance (IR) and (especially) pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in large epidemiological studies. Our objective was to evaluate the associations of hematological parameters, including hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (Hgb), red blood cell count (<e>RBC</e>), and white blood cell count with IR and beta-cell dysfunction in a cohort of nondiabetic subjects at high metabolic risk. METHODS: Nondiabetic subjects (n = 712) were recruited in Toronto and London, Ontario, Canada, between 2004 and 2006, based on the presence of one or more risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus including obesity, hypertension, a family history of diabetes, and/or a history of gestational diabetes. Fasting blood samples were collected and oral glucose tolerance tests administered, with additional samples for glucose and insulin drawn at 30 and 120 min. Measures of IR included the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) and Matsuda's insulin sensitivity index, whereas measures of beta-cell dysfunction included the insulinogenic index divided by HOMA-IR as well as the insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2. Associations of hematological parameters with IR and beta-cell dysfunction were assessed using multiple linear regression and analysis of covariance with adjustments for age, gender, ethnicity, smoking, cardiovascular disease, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and waist circumference. RESULTS: HOMA-IR increased across quartiles of HCT, Hgb, RBC, and white blood cell count after adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, and smoking (all P (trend) &lt;0.0001). Similarly, there was a strong stepwise decrease in the Matsuda's insulin sensitivity index across increasing quartiles of these hematological measures (all P (trend) &lt;0.0001). The associations remained significant after further adjustment for previous cardiovascular disease, blood pressure, and waist circumference (all P (trend) &lt;0.0001). Similarly, there was a strong pattern of decreasing beta-cell function across increasing quartiles of all hematological patterns (all P (trend) &lt;0.0001). The findings for HCT, Hgb, and RBC were attenuated slightly after full multivariate adjustment, although the trend across quartiles remained highly significant. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that standard, clinically relevant hematological variables may be related to the underlying pathophysiological changes associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",M2
19596751,"Long-term association of routine blood count (Coulter) variables on fatal coronary heart disease: 30-year results from the first prospective Northwick Park Heart Study (NPHS-I).BACKGROUND: Since evidence of a long-term association between routine blood count (Coulter) variables and coronary heart disease (CHD) is inconsistent, the authors analysed white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (<e>RBC</e>), haemoglobin (Hgb), packed cell volume (PCV) and platelet count for their long-term associations with CHD mortality in the first Northwick Park Heart Study (NPHS-I). NPHS-I has follow-up information for &gt;30 years on 2167 White men and 941 White women and holds entry and follow-up data on haematological variables and other known CHD risk factors. METHODS: Proportional hazards Cox models were fitted to estimate rate ratios (RRs) for the separate and joint effects of entry and follow-up Coulter variables. RESULTS: Entry RBC, PCV and Hgb were significant risk factors for CHD mortality after adjustment for gender but only PCV remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders [RR per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase = 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.37]. This effect was partly reduced when the values of 6 years were analysed (RR per 1 SD increase = 1.10, 95% CI 0.93-1.30). No significant gender, smoking or age/time interactions were identified. PCV was the only significant predictor when all Coulter variables were studied jointly. CONCLUSION: PCV was found to predict CHD mortality even after controlling for classical risk factors. This may give some insight into possible mechanisms, such as an influence on thrombin production.",M2
19392761,"Cytologic interpretation of canine cerebrospinal fluid samples with low total nucleated cell concentration, with and without blood contamination.BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is potentially altered by iatrogenic blood contamination at the time of sampling due to the addition of blood-associated leukocytes and protein. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess whether protein concentration, neutrophil percentage, and the presence of activated macrophages, reactive lymphocytes, or eosinophils in CSF samples with low total nucleated cell concentration (TNCC) are affected by blood contamination or associated with central nervous system (CNS) disease. METHODS: Case records from the Royal Veterinary College Diagnostic Laboratory were searched retrospectively for dogs with CSF having &lt; or =5 TNCC/microL. TNCC, <e>RBC</e>, and protein concentrations; neutrophil percentage; and the presence of activated macrophages, reactive lymphocytes, and eosinophils were recorded. Results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also were recorded as a marker of CNS disease. RESULTS: Of 906 cases evaluated, 106 (12%) had blood contamination (&gt;500 RBCs/microL) in CSF. Protein concentration and neutrophil percentage were significantly higher and the presence of eosinophils was more likely in blood contaminated vs noncontaminated samples. Non-blood-contaminated samples with activated macrophages or reactive lymphocytes had higher protein concentrations and neutrophil percentages, and those with activated macrophages were more likely to have a positive finding on MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Protein concentration, neutrophil percentage, and the presence of eosinophils are significantly affected by blood contamination in canine CSF having low TNCC. Activated macrophages and reactive lymphocytes are not affected by blood contamination, however, and may be useful in identifying dogs with CNS abnormalities.",M2
19345266,"The effect of Euglena viridis on immune response of rohu, Labeo rohita (Ham.).The study evaluated the effect of dietary doses of Euglena viridis on the immune response and disease resistance of Labeo rohita fingerlings against infection with the bacterial pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila. L. rohita fingerlings were fed with diet containing 0 (Control), 0.1 g, 0.5 g, 1.0 g Euglena powder kg(-1) dry diet for 90 days. Biochemical (serum total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin:globulin ratio), haematological (WBC, <e>RBC</e>, haemoglobin content) and immunological (superoxide anion production, lysozyme, serum bactericidal activity) parameters of fish were examined after 30, 60 and 90 days of feeding. Fish were challenged with A. hydrophila 90 days post-feeding and mortalities were recorded over 10 days post-infection. The results demonstrate that fish fed with Euglena showed increased levels of superoxide anion production, lysozyme, serum bactericidal activity, serum protein and albumin (P &lt; 0.05) compared with the control group. Following challenge with A. hydrophila less survivability was observed in the control group (56.65%) than the group fed the experimental diets. The group fed 0.5 g Euglena kg(-1) dry diet showed the highest percentage survival (75%). These results indicate that Euglena stimulates the immunity and makes L. rohita more resistant to A. hydrophila infection.",M2
19290855,"Flowcytometric assessment of fetomaternal hemorrhage during external cephalic version at term.External cephalic version (ECV) at term is a safe procedure and reduces the incidence of cesarean sections for breech presentation. One of the known complications, however, is an ECV-related disruption of the placental barrier and a subsequent transfusion of fetal blood into maternal circulation. While the incidence of ECV-related fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) has been determined recently in a large trial using a manual Kleihauer-Betke test (KBT), questions remain on the amount of ECV-related FMH. KBT, which detects fetal red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>) on the basis of acidic resistance of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), is known to be a sensitive test, yet prone to procedural errors limiting its accuracy in quantifying FMH. In this study we investigated 50 patients for FMH before and after ECV, using a dual-color flow cytometric test kit with a lower limit of quantification of 0.05% fetal RBC in maternal peripheral blood. Three patients had a quantifiable increase of fetal RBC detected after ECV (0.06%; 0.08%; 0.1%). None of these subtle increments was predictable by ECV-related clinical parameters or translated into fetal compromise. Using a sensitive and accurate flow cytometric test method, our data provide further assurance to mothers on the safety of ECV at term.",M2
19210326,"Flow cytometric assay for the simultaneous determination of residual white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in fresh-frozen plasma: validation and two years' experience.BACKGROUND: A fully automated single-tube assay with tubes (BD TruCOUNT, BD Biosciences) for absolute counting of residual cells in freshly prepared plasma by flow cytometry was developed (BD Plasma Count). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The nucleic acid dye thiazole orange stains white blood cells (WBCs). The monoclonal antibodies anti-CD41a-peridinin chlorophyll protein-Cy5.5 and anti-glycophorin A-fluorescein isothiocyanate label platelets (PLTs) and red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>), respectively. No fixation, permeabilization, or washing steps were required. Validation was done according to guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization and the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Cell-free plasma was spiked with each cell type for accuracy, reproducibility, and linearity measurements. RESULTS: Results showed no carryover or drift under automated sample acquisition conditions. Nonspecific background was fewer than 0.3 cells per microL for residual WBCs (rWBCs), fewer than 2.7 cells per microL for rRBCs, and fewer than 85 cells per microL for rPLTs. Determinations of rWBC and rPLT counts were linear with a coefficient of variation of less than 12 percent for the imprecision. Owing to cross-linking of the anti-glycophorin A antibody, linearity and precision for rRBCs diverged up to 21 percent at a count of 6000 rRBCs per microL. In a 2-year period, five operators investigated 2666 quality control (QC) samples of fresh-frozen plasma on 108 working days. Maximum cell numbers found were 196 for rWBCs, 3960 for rRBCs, and 28,952 for rPLTs per microL. In 31 cases (1.2%) rWBCs were out of specification. No outlier was observed for rRBCs and rPLTs. Residual RBC cell numbers determined were always within the acceptable concentration range of the assay. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that the single-tube test is suitable for routine QC assessment of the cellular contaminants of therapeutic plasma according to the European recommendations.",M2
19152573,"Tissue viability imaging: mapping skin erythema.BACKGROUND: Tissue Viability Imaging (TiVi) is an emerging bioengineering technology intended for two-dimensional mapping of skin erythema and blanching. Before TiVi can be effectively used in studies of diseased or damaged skin, the variability in normal skin red blood cell concentration (<e>RBC</e>(conc)) requires evaluation. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate how TiVi maps spatial and temporal variations in normal skin RBC(conc) at the dorsal side of the hand at rest and during post-occlusive hyperemia. METHODS: Short-term and day-to-day variations in skin RBC(conc) were quantified at the dorsal side of the hand in four healthy volunteers at rest. In a separate study, the increase in skin RBC(conc) was recorded during post-occlusive hyperemia. RESULTS: A lower skin RBC(conc) (179-184 TiVi units) was observed at the back of the hand and base of the thumb compared with areas adjacent to the nailfoldfold region of the fingers (190-213 TiVi units). The short-term variation (within 70 s) was &lt;2% in all areas of the dorsal side of the hand, while day-to-day variations were in the range 5-7% in the back of the hand and up to 10% in areas adjacent to the nailfold region. In the post-occlusive hyperemia phase, up to a 60% increase in skin RBC(conc) was observed in the early part of the reactive hyperemia phase. This increase in skin RBC(conc) successively decreased but remained about 18% above the pre-occlusion level after 30 min. CONCLUSION: Establishment of healthy skin RBC(conc) reference values is important for the design of versatile test procedures for assessment of skin damage caused by vibration tools, chemical exposure or peripheral vascular disease.",M2
19152572,"Cutaneous bioengineering instrumentation standardization: the Tissue Viability Imager.BACKGROUND: Tissue Viability Imaging (TiVi) is a new bioengineering technology intended for remote two-dimensional mapping of skin red blood cell concentration (<e>RBC</e>(conc)). Before use in the laboratory, work-site and dermatology clinic, critical performance parameters of this emerging technology require careful evaluation. OBJECTIVE: To assess short- and long-term stability, image uniformity, distance and image size dependence, ambient light and curvature influence in a production batch of Tissue Viability Imagers. METHODS: Four Tissue Viability Imagers from the same production batch were evaluated at two laboratories (one industrial and one dermatological) with respect to critical parameter performance. RESULTS: The average systematic drift in sensitivity over time was 0.27% and &lt;1.02% for all four units tested. Difference in sensitivity between units was limited to 4.1% and was due to offset rather than gain deviation. Spatial variation in image uniformity was below 3.08% and 1.93% in the corners and centre of an individual image, respectively. This spatial variation could be further reduced to 0.25% and 0.13%, respectively by image normalization. Ambient light from a 40 W bulb or a 11 W fluorescent light source at a distance of 50-60 cm above the object, reduced the recorded values by about 10%, while the camera to object distance and image size had no detectable influence on sensitivity. Curved objects, such as human forearm, demonstrated an edge effect limited to below 10%. CONCLUSION: The critical TiVi performance parameters evaluated proved stable in relation to expected variations in skin RBC(conc) over time. Calibration by way of a two-point method may reduce differences in sensitivity between instruments to further facilitate inter-laboratory comparison of results.",M2
19147709,"Factors associated with traumatic fluoroscopy-guided lumbar punctures: a retrospective review.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To minimize diagnostic confusion, a CSF specimen should be free from traumatically introduced red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>). The purpose of this research is to determine if patient age, sex, gauge of the lumbar puncture (LP) needle, or the level of LP is associated with an increased risk for traumatic fluoroscopy-guided LP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively for consecutive male and female patients of all ages (n = 756) who underwent a fluoroscopy-guided LP for a 2-year period. We defined traumatic LP as a CSF sample with an RBC count more than 500 cells/mm(3) without xanthochromia. RESULTS: Rate of traumatic LP was 13.3%. The rate of traumatic LP at the L4-L5 level (19%) was significantly higher than at the L2-L3 (9%) or L3-L4 level (10%). Patients older than 80 years had higher traumatic LP rates (25.9%) compared with patients between ages 11 and 80 years (12.4%). Sex and gauge of the spinal needle were not associated with increased rate of traumatic LP. Patients younger than 1 year had failed LP rate of 58.8% compared with 3.2% failure rate in older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoroscopy-guided LP at the L4-L5 level is associated with nearly twice the risk for traumatic puncture compared with the L2-L3 or L3-L4 level. Rates of traumatic result are twice as high in adults older than 80 years compared with younger patients. Failure rates for fluoroscopy-guided LP are low except in children younger than 1 year, in whom failure occurs in most cases.",M2
19055858,"Thrombotic complications of polycythemia vera.BACKGROUND: Polycythemia vera (PV) is an uncommon clonal disorder of stem cells. The literature regarding the thrombotic complications of this disorder in the developing countries is scarce. The present study was undertaken retrospectively to look at the association of thrombotic complications of PV with various patient characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the patients diagnosed to have PV from January 1986 to December 2005 according to Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria were included. Their clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, clinical complications such as thrombosis and myelofibrosis, treatment modalities, malignancies and deaths, if any were noted. The various characteristics of patients who had developed thrombosis were compared statistically with those of patients without thrombosis. RESULTS: Out of the 9550 patients seen during this period, 32 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 56.5 years. Eight patients developed thrombotic complications; out of which four had arterial and four had venous thrombosis. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean hemoglobin, white cell count (WBC), platelet count and <e>RBC</e> mass in patients with thrombosis as compared to patients without thrombosis. These parameters were also not statistically significant when patients with arterial thrombosis were compared with patients with venous thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: PV is an uncommon disorder when compared with other hematological disorders in northern India. There was no relationship between the development of thrombotic complications and hemoglobin, RBC mass or platelet count. Twenty patients received hydroxyurea with a median follow-up of 57 months, none developed acute leukemia.",M2
19041105,"Age-related changes in selected haematology parameters in rabbits.Even though there is an abundance of information on the reference values of haematological parameters in adult rabbits, a little is known about the changes in haematology in newborn rabbits or during their postnatal development. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate changes in red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>), white blood cells (WBC) and differential leukocyte counts in SPF New Zealand White rabbits from the age of one day to 20 weeks. Significant age-related changes during the first four weeks of life were detected. These included an increase of RBC and WBC, reversal of the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and increase of total counts of eosinophils and basophils. From the age of six weeks of life, all of the studied haematological parameters were comparable to those of adult rabbits.",M2
19035711,"Conversion of external ventricular drains to ventriculoperitoneal shunts after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: effects of site and protein/red blood cell counts on shunt infection and malfunction.OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of shunt infection in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) after converting an external ventricular drain (EVD) to a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt using the existing EVD site. The second purpose was to assess the risk of shunt malfunction after converting the EVD to a permanent shunt irrespective of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein and red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) counts. METHODS: Data obtained in 80 consecutive adult patients (18 men and 62 women, mean age 60.8 years, range 33-85 years) who underwent direct conversion of an EVD to a VP shunt for post-SAH hydrocephalus between August 2002 and March 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. In each patient, the existing EVD site was used to pass the proximal shunt catheter. In no patient was VP shunt insertion delayed based on preoperative RBC or protein counts. RESULTS: The mean period of external ventricular drainage before VP shunt placement was 14.1 days (range 3-45 days). No patient suffered ventriculitis. The mean perioperative CSF protein level was 124 mg/dl (range 17-516 mg/dl). The mean and median perioperative RBC values in CSF were 14,203 RBCs/mm(3) and 4600 RBCs/mm(3) (range 119-290,000/mm(3)), respectively. No patient was lost to follow-up. The mean follow-up duration was 24 months (range 2-53 months). Three patients (3.8%) had shunt malfunction related to obstruction of the shunt system after 15 days, 2 months, and 18 months, respectively. There were no shunt-related infections. No patient suffered a clinically significant hemorrhage from ventricular catheter placement after VP shunt insertion. CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients with aneurysmal SAH, conversion of an EVD to a VP shunt can be safely done using the same EVD site. In this defined patient population, protein and RBC counts in the CSF do not seem to affect shunt survival adversely. Thus, conversion of an EVD to VP shunt should not be delayed because of an elevated protein or RBC count.",M2
19016148,"Changes in red blood cells membrane protein composition during hemodialysis procedure.Our aim was to evaluate the influence of the hemodialysis (HD) procedure in red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>) membrane protein composition. We evaluated hematological data (RBC count, hemoglobin concentration, and hematimetric indices) and RBC membrane protein composition (linear and exponential gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate [SDS-PAGE] followed by densitometry analysis of RBC membrane proteins) before and immediately after the HD procedure in 20 patients (10 responders and 10 non-responders to recombinant human erythropoietin therapy [rhEPO]) and 26 healthy controls. Before HD, patients presented anaemia and significant changes in membrane protein composition, namely, a statistically significant reduction in spectrin associated with a significant increase in bands 6, as well as an altered membrane protein interaction (protein 4.1/spectrin, protein 4.1/band 3, protein 4.2/band 3 and spectrin/band 3). After HD, we found that patients showed a statistically significant increase in RBC count and hemoglobin, a further and statistically significant decrease in spectrin, an increase in band 3, and an altered spectrin/band 3 ratio. When comparing responders and non-responders patients after HD, we found that the non-responders presented a trend to a higher reduction in spectrin. Our data suggest that HD procedure seems to contribute to a reduction in spectrin, which is normally associated with a reduction in RBC deformability, being that reduction in spectrin is higher in non-responder patients.",M2
18987601,"Effects of subchronic metribuzin exposure on common carp (Cyprinus carpio).OBJECTIVES: Effects of metribuzin on biochemical and haematological indices, induction of specific biomarkers and impacts on biometric parameters of Cyprinus carpio were investigated for subchronic conditions. METHODS: Juvenile fish were exposed to 0.175 mg.L-1 or 1.75 mg.L-1 metribuzin for 28 days. Haematological indices were assessed using unified methods of haematological examination in fish. Biochemical indices were determined by biochemical analyzer, hepatic vitellogenin content was estimated by direct sandwich ELISA. Cytochrome P450 concentration and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity were measured in liver spectrophotometrically and spectrofluorimetrically, respectively. RESULTS: Increased haematocrit and <e>RBC</e> count were found in fish exposed to 1.75 mg.L-1 metribuzin compared to control fish (p&lt;0.05). Other indices contents and biomarkers levels were not significantly changed by either concentration of metribuzin.

18986006,"N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients.Previous reports have shown that N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro-BNP) is a predictive marker for mortality in both peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether NT-Pro-BNP reflects a specific status in PD patients. We analyzed 40 stable PD patients, allocating them to one of two groups (20 each) according to the median value of NT-Pro-BNP: group A below and group B above 5423 pg/mL. In group B as compared with group A, red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, sodium, chlorine, albumin, and daily urinary volume were significantly lower, and cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) and daily ultrafiltration volume were significantly higher. Patients using icodextrin and diabetic patients showed significantly higher NT-Pro-BNP values. We observed significant correlations between NT-Pro-BNP and RBC count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, sodium, chlorine, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, CTR, daily urinary volume, and ultrafiltration volume. Multiple regression analysis revealed that increasing CTR and hyponatremia were significant predictors of an increase in NT-Pro-BNP. Our results indicate that increased serum NT-Pro-BNP well reflects anemia status, water balance, hyponatremia, and hypoalbuminemia in prevalent PD patients.",M2
18958586,"Haemato-biochemical responses and induction of HSP70 to dietary phosphorus in Catla catla (Hamilton) fingerlings.A feeding trial of 120 days was conducted to study the effect of graded levels of dietary phosphorus on haematology, serum protein concentrations and HSP70 expression in fingerlings of the Indian major carp, Catla (Catla catla). Eight isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets were formulated to contain graded levels of dietary phosphorus (dP), i.e., T(1), 0.1%; T(2), 0.3%; T(3), 0.5%; T(4), 0.7%; T(5), 0.9%; T(6), 1.1%; T(7), 1.3%; or T(8), 1.5%. Four hundred and eighty fish (average weight 4.23 +/- 0.016 g) were equally distributed into 24 tanks forming eight treatments with three replicates each. The fish were fed daily at the rate of 3.5% body weight in two instalments. At the end of feeding trial fish were sampled to study total <e>RBC</e> and WBC count, haemoglobin, serum lysozyme activity, serum total protein, albumin (A), globulin (G) concentration and HSP70 expression. Total RBC count, haemoglobin concentration and serum lysozyme activity did not vary significantly in response to different dietary phosphorus concentrations. Total WBC count was found to be significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in T(1 )relative to all other treatments. Serum albumin and A/G ratio was found to be significantly lower in fish of T(1) and T(2) in relation to T(7) group (P &lt; 0.05). Serum globulin and total protein levels remained unaffected by variations in dietary phosphorus. HSP70 expression was observed in T(1) group (0.1% dP) in gills and brain tissue, but not in liver and muscle tissues. No HSP70 expression was observed in fish of T(4) (0.7% dP) and T(8) (1.5% dP) treatments. These prima facie results suggest that dietary phosphorus had only minor influence on the haemato-biochemical parameters studied; however dietary phosphorus deficiency caused organ specific induction of HSP70 in catla fingerlings.",M2
18942593,"In vitro and in vivo studies of the use of some medicinal herbals against the pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila in goldfish.Aeromonas hydrophila is a ubiquitous and opportunistic bacterial pathogen that produces ulcerative dermatitis under stress conditions and inflicts severe losses on global fisheries and fish culture. This study evaluates the antimicrobial potency of aqueous and ethanolic decoction (individual extract) and concoction (mixed extract) of three common medicinal herbs, turmeric Curcuma longa, Tulsi plant Ocimum sanctum, and neem Azadirachta indica, against the in vitro growth of A. hydrophila. Among the decoctions, A. indica exhibited the most potent antibacterial property (P &lt; 0.05) against A. hydrophila. Among the concoctions, both the aqueous and ethanolic triherbal extracts mixed in the ratio of 1:1:1 had higher antibacterial activity (P &lt; 0.05) than the other concoctions and decoctions. Goldfish Carassius auratus (10 +/- 2 g) were challenged with A. hydrophila intramuscularly in the caudal region with two separate doses (days 1 and 3) of 50 microL/fish (1.8 x 10(3) colony-forming units per milliliter). On days 9 (early) and 15 (late) of infection, fish were held in a net and dip treated for 5 min daily in a 1-L solution of 1% aqueous triherbal concoction. Red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels of the infected group were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than those of the control group. In the early treated group, all of the affected profile values returned to near normal, while the late-treated group registered a partial recovery, such as improved RBC count. The derived hematological values, such as mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, of the early and late-treated groups also significantly declined (P &lt; 0.05) but were restored to near normal (P &gt; 0.05) only in the early treated group. The results suggest that dip treatment of A. hydrophila-infected goldfish in an aqueous triherbal concoction had a synergistic restorative effect on the hematological variables.",M2
18922705,"Very rapid clearance after a joint bleed in the canine knee cannot prevent adverse effects on cartilage and synovial tissue.OBJECTIVE: Joint bleeding leads to joint destruction. In vitro exposure of human and canine cartilage to blood results in long-lasting severe adverse changes in cartilage. An in vivo joint haemorrhage in the canine knee joint demonstrates similar adverse effects although significantly less outspoken. As a possible explanation for this discrepancy, we studied the clearance rate of blood from the canine knee joints. METHODS: Blood was injected into the knee joint of Beagle dogs either 48 h, 24h or 15 min before termination. The amount of red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>) and white blood cells (WBCs) present in the joint cavity was determined. Chondrocyte activity and cartilage matrix integrity as well as cartilage destructive activity of synovial tissue were determined biochemically. Additionally, synovial tissue was analyzed by use of histochemistry. RESULTS: The amount of blood was decreased to &lt;5% within 48 h. Within this time period the cartilage was negatively affected and the synovial tissue showed cartilage destructive activity. Evaluation of the synovial tissue 15 min post-injection revealed countless numbers of intact RBC that were almost completely disappeared after 48 h without significant recruitment of macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Blood is cleared very rapidly from the canine knee joint, but already has adverse effects on both cartilage and synovial tissue within that short time span. This rapid clearance can play a role in the discrepancy between long-term in vitro and in vivo effects of blood-induced joint damage since more than 10% v/v blood present for at least 48 h is needed to induce long-term adverse effects in vitro.",M2
18840798,"Sex differences in human biological aging.This study aims to clarify sex differences in human biological aging and to explore the gender gaps in health and longevity. Eighty-six men and 93 women who received a 2-day routine health checkup for 6-7 years beginning in 1992 at the Kyoto Red Cross Hospital were selected. Five candidate biomarkers of aging (forced expiratory volume in 1.0 second per square of height [FEV(1)/Ht(2)], systolic blood pressure [SBP], red blood cells [<e>RBC</e>], albumin [ALBU], and blood urea nitrogen [BUN]) were selected from 29 physiological variables. Individual biological ages (BAS) were estimated from these five biomarkers by a principal component model. From the investigation of the longitudinal changes of individual BAS, it was suggested that (i) beyond 65 years, the rate of aging showed a rapid increase, and (ii) women had relatively lower functional capabilities compared with men, but the rate of aging was slower than that of men, suggesting that these differences might present both disadvantages and advantages for women with regard to health and longevity.",M2
18837576,"Blood parasites of two Costa Rican amphibians with comments on detection and microfilaria density associated with adult filarial worm intensity.The 2 objectives of this study were: (1) to compare parasite detectability in blood smears obtained from toe-clips versus the heart from amphibian hosts; and (2) to test whether microfilariae density is correlated with adult filarial worm intensity. We examined blood parasites of 2 species of amphibians, Rana vaillanti (n = 45) and Eleutherodactylus fitzingeri (n = 36), from Costa Rica collected during the summer of 2003. Separate blood smears were obtained from toe-clips and the heart during necrospy. Eight species of blood parasites were identified from R. vaillanti and 1 from E. fitzingeri. Each parasite species was counted in a 2 x 2.2-cm2 area on each blood smear, and the density of host red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) was estimated using a sub-sampling approach, allowing parasite infections to be expressed as individuals per RBC. The detection failure rate for toe-cut smears ranged from 71-100% (x = 92.3%) and from 0-9% (x = 2.4%) for heart smears, depending on parasite species. The density of RBCs was significantly higher in smears produced from heart samples and may explain the differences in detectability. Foleyellides striatus microfilariae densities (per RBC) were significantly correlated with adult female worm intensity (R2 = 0.32, P = 0.011).",M2

Exposure of fish to copper showed a significant decrease in the haemoglobin (Hb) content from 10.73 to 6.60%, red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>) from 2.86 to 1.84 x 10(6)/mm3 and packed cell volume (PCV) from 31.00 to 23.33% at the end of 45th day as compared to control. Whereas the white blood cells (WBC) increased from 60.00 to 92.48 x10(3)/mm3, clotting time (CT) from 27.66 to 43.00 second, erythrocyte sedimentation rate from 5.0 to 13.66 mm/hr and mean corpuscular volume from 108.11 to 126.85 cmu, significantly, with increase in exposure periods. Although mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) values showed significant increase during 15 and 30 days exposures, both the values were found significantly increased at the end of the experimental period. The differential leucocytes count (DLC) showed a significant increase in the populations of lymphocytes and eosinophils, whereas neutrophils, monocytes and basophiles were found decreased after exposure to copper.",M2
18810986,"[The influence of lysozyme dimmer on chosen parameters of blood in healthy rabbits]The natural compounds which affect defensive mechanisms of organism are important in prophylaxis and therapy of diseases in human and animals. Lysozyme is an enzyme which originates from chicken egg proteins. It modulates non-specific and humoral immunological mechanisms. A higher bioactivity has a lysozyme dimmer. The aim of study was assessment of influence of the lysozyme dimmer on chosen blood parameters, morphology and functions of internal organs and healing processes of experimental wounds in rabbits. Lysozyme dimmer (KLP-602) was used obtained process polymerisations enzyme lyzosyme from chicken egg white. The experimental group were on New Zealand White rabbits. Systemic reactions were investigated in animals after two injections of lysozyme dimer in dose 0,02 mg/kg b.w. during 21 days. Blood was collected before and after administration of lysozyme dimer in 4, 6, 24 h and in 3, 7, 21 day after first and in 4, 24 h and 3, 7 day after second injection. The following parameters were evaluated of red blood cells number (<e>RBC</e>), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), haematocrit value (HCT), red blood cell indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC), white blood cells number (WBC) and leukogram. Total serum proteins, components C3 and C4 of complement, immunoglobulins G and M, concentration were determined in the serum. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and fibrinogen concentration were evaluated in the plasma. Simultaneously, the activity of alkaline phosphatate, GPT and GOT were assessed. Administration rabbits with lysozyme dimmer caused slight decrease in RBC number, Hb concentration, HCT and the neutrophils percentage and increase in the lymphocytes percentage. The concentrations of TSP, immunoglobulins, the components of complement ware increased too. APTT an PT were normal but the fibrinogen concentration was increased. The activity of GOT and GPT were unchanged. Changes are in range of value normal and step out more quickly after two injection than after firste injection. The morphology of organs (liver, lungs, heart and kidneys) was normal.",M2
18773814,"[Study of venous drainage in retrograde island flaps by fluorescence tracing technique in a rabbit model]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the venous drainage in retrograde island flaps by fluorescence tracing technique and to observe the pathway of venous drainage. METHODS: The 0.1 mL venous blood was collected from the marginal ear vein of every rabbit (n=20), respectively, and erythrocytes were separated by centrifugation and then were labeled with FITC. Positive rate and fluorescence intensity of FITC-labeled <e>RBC</e> were detected by flow cytometry. RBC amorphous was observed under the inverted fluorescence microscope. Saphenous retrograde island fasciocutaneous flap and antegrade island fasciocutaneous flap (4.0 cm x 3.0 cm in size with vascular pedicle length of 3.0 cm) were successfully established in hind limbs of 20 New Zealand white rabbits. One hind limb of each rabbit was randomly assigned as the experimental group and the contralateral side was assigned as the control. The same flap was established in the control group without any fluorescence tracer. According to retrograde or antegrade flaps, the experimental group was divided into 2 groups with 10 rabbits in each group. And then, according to different pathways of tracer-giving, each group was divided into 2 subgroups of artery and vein, with 5 rabbits in each subgroup. The labeled erythrocytes (5 microL) were injected into artery or vein and then flaps were cut down 5 seconds later. The flaps were immediately frozen and chipped (5-7 microm). Consecutive three frozen sections were made and two of them were stained with HE and GENMED, respectively, but the third one was squashed without staining. All frozen sections were observed under the microscope. RESULTS: Positive rate of FITC-labeled RBC was beyond 99% and fluorescence intensity was more than or equal to 10(3). FITC-labeled RBC showed steady green fluorescence under the inverted fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence appeared in all experimental groups, but none was found in the control groups. In antegrade island flap group, fluorescence appeared mainly in lumen of vein, wall of vein and inner membrane and outer membrane of artery. In retrograde island flap group, fluorescence distributed principally in inner membrane and outer membrane of artery and wall of vein. CONCLUSION: The fluorescence tracing is applicable to the research of venous drainage. Venous drainage in the antegrade island flaps is mainly through lumen of vein, wall of vein and inner membrane and outer membrane of artery. While, venous drainage in retrograde island flaps is principally through inner membrane and outer membrane of artery and wall of vein.",M2
18662197,"Monitoring 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations in Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease.BACKGROUND AND AIM: There have been no reports on 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) concentrations in Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergoing azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) therapy. The aim of this study was to assess 6-TGN concentrations in Japanese IBD patients. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with Crohn's disease (n = 42) and ulcerative colitis (n = 41) were enrolled. In 69 patients, AZA was prescribed at 50 mg/day, and seven patients were given 75 (n = 5) or 100 mg/day (n = 2). 6-MP was administered at 30 mg/day (n = 7). The 6-TGN concentrations were then assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The mean 6-TGN concentrations of the entire study population (n = 83) were 277.9 +/- 179.8 pmol/8 x 10(8) red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>). The mean 6-TGN concentrations in those patients with active disease (n = 38) and those in remission (n = 45) were 232.9 +/- 159.7(mean +/- SD) and 342.8 +/- 184.6 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). The odds ratio of being in remission and having a 6-TGN value &gt;235 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC was 2.6 (95% CI 1.05-6.2). A significant inverse correlation was found between the white blood cell (WBC) counts and 6-TGN concentrations (r = -0.301, P &lt; 0.05, n = 83); the mean WBC counts of the active patients (6780 +/- 2412) were significantly higher than the patients in clinical remission (5468 +/- 1920, P &lt; 0.05). Three patients with severe leukopenia and 10 patients with high 6-TGN concentrations had no thiopurine S-methyl transferase mutations. CONCLUSION: The 6-TGN concentrations in Japanese patients with IBD on low-dose AZA and 6-MP therapy were comparable to those reported from Western countries. The monitoring of 6-TGN concentrations may be helpful for developing a therapeutic strategy for Japanese IBD patients.",M2
18649034,"Influence of zinc on cadmium induced haematological and biochemical responses in a freshwater teleost fish Catla catla.The haematological (Hb, <e>RBC</e>, WBC) and biochemical (protein and glucose) profiles of a freshwater fish Catla catla were studied under sub-lethal toxicity of cadmium chloride for 25 days (Treatment I). In addition, the influence of zinc on cadmium toxicity was investigated for haematological and biochemical parameters (Treatment II). In both the experiments, blood haemoglobin and plasma protein level decreased in the treated fish. However, WBC, RBC and plasma glucose levels were increased in Treatment I, while Treatment II showed mixed results. In Treatment II the alterations of both haematological and biological parameters were minimal compared with Treatment I. The alterations of these parameters are discussed as non-specific biomarkers against metal toxicity in aquatic organisms.",M2
18543064,"Effects of psychological stress on serum iron and erythropoiesis.There are about one billion patients with iron deficiency anaemia all over the world. Recently, researchers have reported successively that stress can cause decrease of serum iron, in consistent with our studies showing that heat exposure and acceleration stress led to significant decrease of serum iron in rats. However, so far whether pure psychological stress can cause decrease of serum iron and consequently affect erythropoiesis has not been reported. To study the characteristic effects of psychological stress on serum iron and erythropoiesis, and to establish an useful experimental basis for further study involving how sufficient intake of dietary iron causes decrease of serum iron and the consequent effects on physiological function of the human body. Psychological stress was administered to 20 rats with Communication Box system. On the 7th and 14th day after administration, 10 rats were executed, respectively, and the rat blood and femoral bone marrow were collected for analysis of serum iron (SI), serum ferritin (SF), serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), haemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell count (<e>RBC</e>), RBC distribution width (RDW), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), serum erythropoietin (EPO) and bone marrow iron. Experimental data were statistically analysed with SPSS 11.0. For rats analysed on the 7th and 14th day in psychological stress group, (1) femoral bone marrow iron was significantly decreased; (2) serum iron was decreased by 28.6% (P &lt; 0.01) and 27.5% (P &lt; 0.01); (3) Hb was decreased by 10.0% (P &lt; 0.01) and 12.8% (P &lt; 0.01), RBC count was decreased by 5.1% (P &lt; 0.05) and 9.8% (P &lt; 0.01), MCV was decreased by 1.7% (P &lt; 0.05) and 7.3% (P &lt; 0.01), RDW was increased by 10.7 and 22.5%; (4) serum ferritin, transferrin receptor and EPO showed no significant changes in comparison with controls after 7-day administration, but serum ferritin and EPO were decreased by 23.8 and 12.3% while transferrin receptor increased by 31.5% after 14-day administration. For rats receiving different period of pure psychological stress: (1) serum iron and bone marrow iron showed significant decrease compared with the controls; (2) erythropoiesis was significantly inhibited; however, (3) how psychological stress affects serum iron and erythropoiesis need to be further investigated.",M2
18533927,"Evaluation of the ADVIA 120 for analysis of canine cerebrospinal fluid.BACKGROUND: Conventional techniques for canine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis require large sample volumes and are labor intensive and subject to operator variability. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ADVIA120 CSF assay for analysis of canine CSF samples. METHODS: CSF samples collected from 36 healthy control dogs and 17 dogs with neurologic disease were processed in parallel using the automated assay and established manual methods using a hemocytometer and cytocentrifugation. Results for WBC (total nucleated cell) count, <e>RBC</e> count, and differential nucleated cell percentages were compared using Spearman rank correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman bias plots. RESULTS: Correlation coefficients for WBC and RBC counts were 0.57 and 0.83 for controls, and 0.92 and 0.94 for ill dogs, respectively. Coefficients for the percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes were 0.53, 0.26, and 0.12 for controls and 0.77, 0.92, and 0.70 for dogs with neurologic disease. When data were combined (n=53), correlation coefficients were 0.86 and 0.91 for WBC and RBC counts, and 0.63, 0.43, and 0.30 for neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte percentages. A 9.5% positive bias and 7.0% negative bias were obtained for the ADVIA 120 CSF assay for lymphocytes and macrophages in dogs with neurologic disease with Bland-Altman analysis. A 12.2% positive bias was found for lymphocyte percentage in dogs with neurologic disease. CONCLUSIONS: Manual and automated CSF assays had moderate to excellent correlation for WBC and RBC concentrations, but results were more variable for differential cell percentages. The ADVIA assay may be more useful for assessment of canine CSF with adjustment of cell differentiation algorithms.",M2
18471839,"Haematological evaluation of patients bitten by the jararaca, Bothrops jararaca, in Brazil.Complete blood counts are used frequently by physicians to assess and manage the development of complications of diseases. We studied 100 patients bitten by Bothrops jararaca snakes, and correlated their haematological values with the severity of envenoming and the development of complications. Patients who developed both local and systemic bleeding showed a greater drop in packed cell volume, red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) count and haemoglobin concentration than those with who did not bleed. No morphological changes in RBCs were seen in blood films. Total white blood cell (WBC) counts were significantly higher in the clinically  more severe  group than in the  less severe  group on admission. Neutrophilic leucocytosis with left shift was present on admission, concurrently with a decrease in eosinophil and lymphocyte counts. These changes tend to become more marked 6h after antivenom therapy, and are greatest in  more severe  envenoming. Thrombocytopenia on admission is positively associated with the development of systemic bleeding and the severity of envenoming. Thrombocytopenia may also be a useful prognostic indicator for the development of local complications, such as necrosis. The intensity of neutrophilia and eosinopenia might be used to follow the progression of necrosis in victims of snake bite.",M2
18448414,"Poor condition and infection: a vicious circle in natural populations.Pathogens may be important for host population dynamics, as they can be a proximate cause of morbidity and mortality. Infection dynamics, in turn, may be dependent on the underlying condition of hosts. There is a clear potential for synergy between infection and condition: poor condition predisposes to host infections, which further reduce condition and so on. To provide empirical data that support this notion, we measured haematological indicators of infection (neutrophils and monocytes) and condition (red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) and lymphocytes) in field voles from three populations sampled monthly for 2 years. Mixed-effect models were developed to evaluate two hypotheses, (i) that individuals with low lymphocyte and/or RBC levels are more prone to show elevated haematological indicators of infection when re-sampled four weeks later, and (ii) that a decline in indicators of condition is likely to follow the development of monocytosis or neutrophilia. We found that individuals with low RBC and lymphocyte counts had increased probabilities of developing monocytosis and higher increments in neutrophils, and that high indices of infection (neutrophilia and monocytosis) were generally followed by a declining tendency in the indicators of condition (RBCs and lymphocytes). The vicious circle that these results describe suggests that while pathogens overall may be more important in wildlife dynamics than has previously been appreciated, specific pathogens are likely to play their part as elements of an interactive web rather than independent entities.",M2

18376176,"The ratio of fibrinogen to red cells transfused affects survival in casualties receiving massive transfusions at an army combat support hospital.BACKGROUND: To treat the coagulopathy of trauma, some have suggested early and aggressive use of cryoprecipitate as a source of fibrinogen. Our objective was to determine whether increased ratios of fibrinogen to red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) decreased mortality in combat casualties requiring massive transfusion. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 252 patients at a U.S. Army combat support hospital who received a massive transfusion (&gt;or=10 units of RBCs in 24 hours). The typical amount of fibrinogen within each blood product was used to calculate the fibrinogen-to-RBC (F:R) ratio transfused for each patient. Two groups of patients who received either a low (&lt;0.2 g fibrinogen/RBC Unit) or high (&gt;or=0.2 g fibrinogen/RBC Unit) F:R ratio were identified. Mortality rates and the cause of death were compared between these groups, and logistic regression was used to determine if the F:R ratio was independently associated with survival. RESULTS: Two-hundred and fifty-two patients who received a massive transfusion with a mean (SD) ISS of 21 (+/-10) and an overall mortality of 75 of 252 (30%) were included. The mean (SD) F:R ratios transfused for the low and high groups were 0.1 grams/Unit (+/-0.06), and 0.48 grams/Unit (+/-0.2), respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Mortality was 27 of 52 (52%) and 48 of 200 (24%) in the low and high F:R ratio groups respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Additional variables associated with survival were admission temperature, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, International Normalized Ratio (INR), base deficit, platelet concentration and Combined Injury Severity Score (ISS). Upon logistic regression, the F:R ratio was independently associated with mortality (odds ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.171-0.812, p = 0.013). The incidence of death from hemorrhage was higher in the low F:R group, 23/27 (85%), compared to the high F:R group, 21/48 (44%) (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with combat-related trauma requiring massive transfusion, the transfusion of an increased fibrinogen: RBC ratio was independently associated with improved survival to hospital discharge, primarily by decreasing death from hemorrhage. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the best source of fibrinogen and the optimal empiric ratio of fibrinogen to RBCs in patients requiring massive transfusion.",M2
18379624,"Haematopoietic properties of ethanolic extract of Ageratum conyzoides (goat weed) in albino rats.The potential haematological effects associated with the administration of ethanolic leaf extract of Ageratum conyzoides was investigated in rats. 27 rats were randomly divided into four groups. The first group had 6 rats and served as control, the remaining 3 experimental groups and had 7 rats each. These later groups were gavaged with the extract of Ageratum conyzoides in concentrations of 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg respectively for 30 days at a dose of 0.1 ml/body weight. The control group was gavaged with 0.9% sodium chloride at a dose of 0.1 m1/body weight as placebo. The extract at the doses administered was found to increase in a dose-related fashion PCV and Hb ([P &lt; 0.01] for 200 mg/kg and [P &lt; 0.001] for 400 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg), <e>RBC</e> ([P &lt; 0.05] for 400 mg/Kg and 500 mg/kg) and marginal increases that were not significant for 200 mg/kg); MCH and MCV ([P &lt; 0.05] and [P &lt; 0.01] for 400 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg respectively) 200 mg/kg was not significant. MCHC recorded no significant change. WBC recorded marginal increases that were not significant, similarly, the differential white blood cell recorded marginal increases that were not significant, except lymphocytes that recorded significant increase in group 4 [P &lt; 0.05]. Marginal decreases in body weight were also observed, these decreases were however not significant. The result of this study thus indicate haematopoietic potentials of the extract and could possibly remedy anaemia.",M2
18343934,"A long-standing incomprehensible matter of obstetrics: meconium-stained amniotic fluid, a new approach to reason.OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether meconium-stained amniotic fluid is based on chronic hypoxia or not? In case of chronic hypoxia, higher red blood cell (<e>Rbc</e>) count and/or total hemoglobin levels (Hgb) and/or higher fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and/or lower adult hemoglobin (HbA) levels were expected when compared with controls. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Obstetric unit of a tertiary ministry of health hospital. SAMPLE: Fifty singleton pregnancies with meconium-stained amniotic fluid and 50 singleton pregnancies with clear amniotic fluid at all stages of labor. METHODS: Umbilical cord blood samples were collected for determination of total blood parameters and hemoglobin electrophoresis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Red blood cell count, total hemoglobin, fetal and adult hemoglobin contents (HbF and HbA). RESULTS: Red blood cell count, total hemoglobin, fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and adult hemoglobin (HbA) contents were not different between meconium stained and clear amniotic fluid groups. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that meconium passage may not be associated with chronic fetal hypoxia as demonstrated by similar red blood cell count, total hemoglobin values and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and adult hemoglobin (HbA) contents.",M2
18309490,"Anemia in monkey collagen-induced arthritis is correlated with serum IL-6, but not TNFalpha.We characterized the anemia in monkey collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) to evaluate whether this model is useful to analyze the basis of an anemia of inflammatory diseases. Cynomolgus monkey was immunized with bovine type II collagen on days 0 and 21. Blood samples were collected regularly and hematological parameters, biochemical parameters and cytokine levels were monitored. Red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) counts, hematocrit (Ht), and hemoglobin (Hb) gradually decreased after immunization and reached the bottom on day 35. CRP rose rapidly after first immunization and reached a peak on day 21. Serum iron levels and transferrin (Tf) saturation were dropped after immunization and reached a bottom on day 28. Thereafter it returned to normal. On the other hand, ferritin levels increased after immunization. IL-6 levels showed positive correlation with CRP, and negative correlation with Hb, RBC counts and serum iron, but TNFalpha did not show any correlation. In conclusion, the anemia in monkey CIA is very similar to human anemia of inflammatory diseases concerning the changes of serum parameters. And our data strongly suggest that IL-6 is an essential cytokine for the development of the anemia in monkey CIA.",M2

METHODS: Three hundred and ninety-seven patients, with confirmed diagnosis of active RA, were randomly assigned to the WM group (194 patients) and the CM group (203 patients). The WM applied covered non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents and slow acting medicine; and the CM given included basic remedy and syndrome differentiating medication. Related blood biochemical and immunological indexes were determined before and after treatment to screen out the cartilage erosion related factors and to compare the influence of CM and WM on them. RESULTS: Patients' peripheral red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) and platelet (PLT) count were changed closely along with their degree of cartilage erosion. RBC count increased in the CM group and PLT count lowered in the WM group after treatment, all showed statistical significance; comparison of the two indexes between the two groups showed that statistical difference presented in RBC but not in PLT count. CONCLUSION: Both WM and CM can ameliorate the cartilage erosive factor in RA, but they are acting in different ways.",M2
18192142,"A model for automated screening of thalassemia in hematology (math study).BACKGROUND: beta-thalassemia screening is primarily limited to pregnant women. The ratio of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and red blood cell count (<e>RBC</e>) can be automatically calculated with any of the newer hematology analyzers. METHODS: The results of 398 patient screens were collected. Data from the set were divided into training and validation subsets. The Mentzer ratio was determined through a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve on the first subset, and screened for thalassemia using the second subset. HgbA2 levels were used to confirm beta-thalassemia. RESULTS: We determined the correct decision point of the Mentzer index to be a ratio of 20. Physicians can screen patients using this index before further evaluation for beta-thalassemia (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSION: The proposed method can be implemented by hospitals and laboratories to flag positive matches for further definitive evaluation, and will enable beta-thalassemia screening of a much larger population at little to no additional cost.",M2
18184391,"Evolution of serum biochemical indicators in anorexia nervosa patients: a 1-year follow-up study.BACKGROUND: Long-term studies on the evolution of serum biochemical indicators in anorexia nervosa (AN) patients during treatment are lacking in the literature. Thus, a 1-year follow-up of serum biochemical parameters in a homogeneous group of AN patients was performed. METHODS: Fourteen restricting-type AN patients were studied on admission to hospital, after 1 month of inpatient treatment and after 6 and 12 months after admission. RESULTS: Red blood cell count (<e>RBC</e>) and haemoglobin, serum glucose, total protein and the enzyme activities aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (AlP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) were significantly lower in patients on admission than in the control group. Total protein, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), AST, AlP and CK showed significant changes among time points (anova, P &lt; 0.05). Significant correlations were found between the change in RBC, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and the change in weight and body mass index (r = 0.74-0.86; P &lt; 0.01). High cholesterol and amylase activity were found at all time points. While AST, LDH and CK reached control values within 6 months of treatment, AlP was always lower. CONCLUSION: Serum AlP, hypercholesterolaemia and RBC seem to need longer periods of treatment with further weight gain to fully normalize. Therefore, these parameters should be monitored in AN patients long-term follow-up.",M2
17888061,"Nonsurgical bleeding diathesis in anemic thrombocytopenic patients: role of temperature, red blood cells, platelets, and plasma-clotting proteins.Research at the Naval Blood Research Laboratory (Boston, MA) for the past four decades has focused on the preservation of red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>), platelets (PLTs), and plasma-clotting proteins to treat wounded servicemen suffering blood loss. We have studied the survival and function of fresh and preserved RBCs and PLTs and the function of fresh and frozen plasma-clotting proteins. This report summarizes our peer-reviewed publications on the effects of temperature, RBCs, PLTs, and plasma-clotting proteins on the bleeding time (BT) and nonsurgical blood loss. The term nonsurgical blood loss refers to generalized, systemic bleeding that is not corrected by surgical interventions. We observed that the BT correlated with the volume of shed blood collected at the BT site and to the nonsurgical blood loss in anemic thrombocytopenic patients after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Many factors influence the BT, including temperature; hematocrit (Hct); PLT count; PLT size; PLT function; and the plasma-clotting proteins factor (F)VIII, von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen level. Our laboratory has studied temperature, Hct, PLT count, PLT size, and PLT function in studies performed in non-aspirin-treated and aspirin-treated volunteers, in aspirin-treated baboons, and in anemic thrombocytopenic patients. This monograph discusses the role of RBCs and PLTs in the restoration of hemostasis, in the hope that a better understanding of the hemostatic mechanism might improve the treatment of anemic thrombocytopenic patients. Data from our studies have demonstrated that it is important to transfuse anemic thrombocytopenic patients with RBCs that have satisfactory viability and function to achieve a Hct level of 35 vol percent before transfusing viable and functional PLTs. The Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) Collaborative recommends that preserved PLTs have an in vivo recovery of 66 percent of that of fresh PLTs and a life span that is at least 50 percent that of fresh PLTs. Their recommendation does not include any indication that preserved PLTs must be able to function to reduce the BT and reduce or prevent nonsurgical blood loss. One of the hemostatic effects of RBC is to scavenge endothelial cell nitric oxide, a vasodilating agent that inhibits PLT function. In addition, endothelin may be released from endothelial cells, a potent vasoconstrictor substance,to reduce blood flow at the BT site. RBCs, like PLTs at the BT site, may provide arachidonic acid and adenosine diphosphate to stimulate the PLTs to make thromboxane, another potent vasoconstrictor substance and a PLT-aggregating substance. At the BT site, the PLTs and RBCs are activated and phosphatidyl serine is exposed on both the PLTs and the RBCs. FVa and FXa, which generate prothrombinase activity to produce thrombin, accumulate on the PLTs and RBCs. A Hct level of 35 vol percent at the BT site minimizes shear stress and reduces nitric oxide produced by endothelial cells. The transfusion trigger for prophylactic PLT transfusion should consider both the Hct and the PLT count. The transfusion of RBCs that are both viable and functional to anemic thrombocytopenic patients may reduce the need for prophylactic leukoreduced PLTs, the alloimmunization of the patients, and the associated adverse events related to transfusion-related acute lung injury. The cost for RBC transfusions will be significantly less than the cost for the prophylactic PLT transfusions.",M2
17918526,"Predictive value of cerebrospinal fluid parameters in neonates with intraventricular drainage devices.OBJECT: Infection is a common and potentially devastating complication following placement of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reservoirs in neonates. The goal of this study was to determine the normal ranges for cell count parameters in neonates with VP shunts and CSF reservoirs, as well as to determine the predictive value of CSF parameters as markers of infection. METHODS: The authors evaluated neonates from 150 different neonatal intensive care units of the Pediatrix Medical Group who had undergone a lumbar puncture, VP shunt insertion, or CSF reservoir placement between 1997 and 2004. Data were collected from 9704 neonates with a mean birthweight of 2573 g and a mean gestational age of 35 weeks. Of these neonates, 181 had VP shunt insertions or CSF reservoir placements. RESULTS: In neonates with negative CSF cultures, significant differences were found between those with and without VP shunts or CSF reservoirs when comparing red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) count (620/mm' compared with 155/mm3, p &lt; 0.05), absolute eosinophil count (4/mm3 compared with 2/mm3, p &lt; 0.001), protein levels (179 mg/dl compared with 115 mg/dl, p &lt; 0.001), and glucose levels (27.5 mg/dl compared with 49 mg/dl, p &lt; 0.001). No significant difference was found between white blood cell (WBC) counts in neonates with or without VP shunts who had negative CSF cultures. The sensitivity and specificity of a cutoff value of 20 WBCs/mm3 for diagnosing meningitis in neonates with positive cultures and intraventricular drainage devices were 67% and 62%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although differences exist between CSF parameters found in neonates with or without VP shunts or CSF reservoirs, only the difference in RBC count is large enough to be clinically significant. The authors found that the utility of CSF parameters in neonates with VP shunts or CSF reservoirs was limited due to poor diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.",M2
17867630,"The effect of ultrapure dialysate on improving renal anemia.BACKGROUND: Renal anemia is a very serious problem in hemodialysis patients. In this regard, the investigation was focused on whether ultrapure dialysate could improve renal anemia and the mechanism of renal anemia. METHODS: Ultrapure dialysate was used over a 2 years period for 61 patients on maintenance hemodialysis. During this period, the changes in renal anemia and red blood cell life span were investigated. The changes in the latter were evaluated using the creatine concentration in red blood cell. RESULTS: The hemoglobin concentration, <e>RBC</e> count, and hematocrit concentration before the use of the ultrapure dialysate were 9.1 +/- 0.2 g/dL, 309.9 +/- L7.2 x 10(4)/microL, and 28.8 +/- 0.6%, respectively. These values significantly increased to 10.2 +/- 0.1 g/dL, 349.7 +/- 5.6 x 10(4)/microL, and 32.6 +/- 0.3%, respectively, after 2 years of ultrapure dialysate use. The increase in reticulocyte count indicated enhanced erythropoiesis by ultrapure dialysate. The red blood cell life span evaluated by creatine concentration in red blood cell was also prolonged after the use of ultrapure dialysate. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrapure dialysate is considered to improve the renal anemia of dialysis patients by promoting erythropoiesis and prolonging red blood cell life span.",M2

The Z2 was evaluated according to guidelines published by the International Committee for Standardisation in Haematology. The results demonstrated excellent linearity for WBC and RBC (r &gt; 0.999). The Z2 showed excellent precision, with a within-run, between-run and overall coefficient of variance less than 2%. Carryover was generally acceptable (&lt;1%). WBC and RBC were stable after blood storage for 48 h at 4 degrees C and room temperature. There was almost no interference for WBC, RBC at high concentrations of bilirubin (178.5 mumol/l) or triglyceride (14.8 mmol/l) (P &gt; 0.05). The bias of coincidence correction in WBC and RBC counting with the Z2 was less than 1%. Correlation between the Z2 and Sysmex F-820 or SE-9500 was excellent (r &gt; 0.996) for WBC and RBC counting. Our results indicate that the Z2 has good features of precision, accuracy, linearity and good comparison with other haematology analysers, and could be used as a calibrating instrument for WBC and RBC counting.",M2

The mice were euthanized 15 weeks after the first dose. Blood cell counts and histologic analyses were done. WT and NQO2(-/-) mice showed hypocellularity and a significant increase in adipocytes in bone marrow. They also showed anemia because of the loss of <e>RBC</e> and hemoglobin. The neutrophils and platelets were reduced, whereas other blood cell types and tissues were normal. Interestingly, NQO1(-/-) mice showed a complete resistance to mitomycin C-induced bone marrow cytotoxicity and reduction in RBC, hemoglobin, and neutrophils. NQO1(+/-) mice also showed limited resistance to mitomycin C-induced bone marrow cytotoxicity. These data show a major in vivo role of NQO1 in metabolic activation of mitomycin C with implications in mitomycin C chemotherapy.",M2
17728190,"Antioxidant defenses and biochemical changes in pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) in response to single and combined copper and hypoxia exposure.The effect of combined-factors (hypoxia+copper) on the biochemical parameters and antioxidant defenses were studied in the neotropical fish Piaractus mesopotamicus. Fish were exposed for 48 h to 0.4 mg Cu(2+) L(-1) (0.4Cu), hypoxia=50 mm Hg (Hpx), and 0.4 mg Cu(2) L(-1)+hypoxia=50 mm Hg (0.4CuHpx). The exposure to 0.4Cu increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the liver, accompanied by increases in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreases in catalase (CAT) activity, showing the influence of copper in this protection. The exposure to Hpx decreased the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and CAT. Exposure to a combined-factor caused an increase in the ROS production followed by an increase in SOD and a decrease in GSH-Px and CAT. At 0.4Cu, fish presented a reduction in CAT, while in Hpx decreases in SOD, CAT and GSH-Px were observed in red muscles. Single-factors were insufficient to cause ROS production. In combined-factors, increased ROS formation and decreased SOD, CAT and GSH-Px were observed. <e>RBC</e> increased in all groups, but only under combined-factors was there an increase in hemoglobin. Copper plasma concentration increased in groups exposed to copper. Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in gills decreased in 0.4Cu and 0.4CuHpx, and increased in Hpx. Metallothionein concentration in gills increased under combined-factors. Combined-factors caused significant disturbances in the antioxidant defenses and biochemical parameters than single-factors.",M2

17690522,"Hematological follow-up of an intervention program adding rubber glove-wearing to local ventilation for 2-ethoxyethanol acetate-exposed workers.The objective of this study was to evaluate an intervention program, implemented in year 1999, of wearing rubber gloves in addition to engineering control, and to follow-up the hematological effects of 2-ethoxyethanol acetate (2-EEA) exposure among workers in a silk-screening factory. All workers from the printing department with direct exposure to 2-EEA were recruited as the exposed group. Workers from the other departments were recruited as the comparison group. Hematological parameters were measured during health surveys conducted 3 times every two years. Information on personal characteristics and working habits was obtained through a structured questionnaire. More female workers were involved in manual printing resulting in higher exposure to 2-EEA. Hemoglobin and haematocrit levels in female exposed workers were significantly lower than those of female comparison workers in the 1st (1998) health survey, but not in the 2nd (2000) and 3rd (2002) health surveys. No difference was found between male exposed and comparison workers for all three surveys. Longitudinal analysis after adjusting for confounders using the general estimating equation model showed the hemoglobin, haematocrit, and <e>RBC</e> count were significantly higher for 2-EEA exposed workers than comparison workers across the 3 surveys (n=42). The results show that wearing rubber gloves in addition to local ventilation was effective at preventing direct dermal exposure to 2-EEA and ameliorated the hematological effects of 2-EEA exposure.",M2
17674797,"[Study of the Shenshuaining dispersible tablets in treating chronic renal failure rats induced by adenine]OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Shenshuaining dispersible tablets in treating chronic renal failure (CRF) rats. METHODS: Seventy-two Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal control group, model control group, Niaoduqing group, Shenshuaining dispersible tablets group (high, middle and low dose). Model of CRF was constnucted by feeding the rats with feed containing 0.5% adenine. After 7 weeks, renal function, albumin (Alb), blood routine, blood electrolyte were detected and general status, changes of the kidney tissue were observed. RESULTS: Compared with normal rats, the levels of serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr) were markedly elevated in CRF rats, while the levels of Alb markedly failed. The serum potassium, natrium and phosphorus contents were significantly increased, the serum calcium contents were significantly decreased. The levels of red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>), hemoglobin and haematocrit were significantly failed. The CRF rats' kidney indexes were increased and appeared abnormity under pathology inspection. Shenshuaining dispersible tablets could markedly ameliorate above indexes. CONCLUSION: Shenshuaining dispersible tablets can treat CRF through effectively ameliorating the CRF rats' renal function, regulating the electrolyte turbulence, increasing the levels of Alb and ameliorate anemia and pathological changes of the kidney tissue.",M2

METHODS: The change of cerebral tissues mRNA expression in SAM was analyzed and compared by messenger ribonucleic acids reverse transcription differential display polymerase chain reaction (mRNA DDRT-PCR) between the medicated group and the control group. RESULTS: BSYNT could increase the level of hemoglobin (Hb) and amount of erythrocyte (<e>RBC</e>) of blood deficiency mice, improve the spatial learning and memory function and the escape response by conditional stimulus. In this study, 14 differential display bands had been discerned, and three of them had been sequenced. The sequence of the three fragments was similar to fatty acid binding protein 7, ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase complex (7. 2 kD) and 60S ribosomal protein L21 respectively. And the homogeneity was 97% , 100% , and 99% , respectively.

17541178,"Comparative study of circadian variation in numbers of peripheral blood cells among mouse strains: unique feature of C3H/HeN mice.We examined strain differences in numbers of blood cells and their circadian rhythms in male Jcl:ICR, BALB/cA, C57BL/6J and C3H/HeN mice. The total numbers of circulating white blood cells (WBCs) were increased during subjective day and night, and the peaks in the active period were common to all strains. However, the number of WBCs in C3H/HeN mice remained lower and plasma levels of corticosterone (CS) were slightly higher throughout the day compared with the other strains. The numbers of circulating red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>) also differed according to strain. The numbers of RBCs, hematocrit (HCT) and hemoglobin (HGB) were considerably lower in C3H/HeN mice compared with the other strains, although mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were highest among the tested strains. We found that serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels were considerably higher in C3H/HeN mice than in the other three strains. The high EPO level might be related to the unique features of RBCs in C3H/HeN mice. The present observations provide basic information about the numbers of peripheral blood cells and their circadian rhythm in mouse models and also demonstrate a unique feature of C3H/HeN mice.",M2
17402476,"Effect of corticosteroid and bronchodilator therapy on bronchoalveolar lavage cytology following intrapulmonary blood inoculation.REASON FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Intrapulmonary blood causes an inflammatory response. Modifying this inflammatory response may be useful in the treatment of exercise induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of 3 treatments, an oral bronchodilator, inhaled steroid and oral steroid in modifying the cellular response to intrapulmonary blood inoculation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental design was a randomised block divided into 4 experimental segments of 2 weeks. Eight normal horses were randomly assigned to pairs and treatments. Autologous blood was inoculated into the lungs on 4 occasions over an 8 week period. For each treatment, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample was collected on Day 0 and then 2 randomly selected segmental bronchi (one in each lung) were inoculated with blood (50 ml). BAL fluid was collected from one inoculated bronchus on Day 3 and from the other on Day 10. From BAL samples, total <e>RBC</e> and total and differential WBC were determined. Results for percentages and absolute cell counts were expressed as mean +/- s.e. and analysed using one, 2 and 3 way analysis of variance. RESULTS: All treatments significantly reduced the number of erythrophages at Day 3 (P = 0.02) Treatment with oral prednisolone resulted in a significantly higher percentage of macrophages (P = 0.03) and also reduced the relative and absolute number of haemosiderophages in BAL compared to the other 2 treatments at Day 10 (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: We concluded that treatments altered the dynamics of cell populations in BAL following blood inoculation. Whether this alters the evolution of lung lesions following episodes of EIPH and indeed whether there are benefits for equine lungs following episodes of EIPH, remain to be determined. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Future studies into treatments for EIPH may benefit from incorporating a variety of dose rates for oral prednisolone and a longer period of evaluation. Such studies may also benefit from the use of cell activation markers. The concomitant use of pulmonary function testing and cytology in the field may assist in ascertaining whether treatments influence the performance and welfare of athletic horses subsequent to episodes of EIPH.",M2
17402472,"The effect of inspired gas density on pulmonary artery transmural pressure and exercise induced pulmonary haemorrhage.REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Pulmonary capillary stress failure, largely as a result of high pulmonary vascular pressures, has been implicated in the aetiology of EIPH. However, the role of the respiratory system in determining the magnitude of EIPH has received little attention. HYPOTHESIS: Horses breathing a gas of greater density than air will exhibit greater transmural pulmonary arterial pressures (TPAP) and more severe EIPH, and horses breathing a gas of lower density than air will exhibit lower TPAP and less severe EIPH, both compared with horses breathing air. METHODS: Following a warm-up, 8 Thoroughbred horses were exercised for 1 min at 10, 11 and 12 m/sec (5 degrees incline) breathing air or 21% oxygen/79% helium or 21% oxygen/79% argon in a randomised order. Heart rate, respiratory rate, pulmonary arterial pressure and oesophageal pressure were measured during exercise. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from the dorsocaudal regions of the left and right lungs 40 min post exercise and red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) counts were performed. RESULTS: The exercise tests induced mild EIPH. Maximum changes in oesophageal pressure were lower on helium-oxygen compared to argon-oxygen (P&lt;0.001). TPAP and median RBC counts did not differ between gas mixtures. BALF RBC counts from the left lung correlated with counts from the right lung (P&lt;0.0001). However BALF RBC counts from the left lung were higher than those from the right lung (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: As alterations in pulmonary arterial and oesophageal pressure caused by changes in inspired gas density were of similar magnitude, TPAP remained unchanged and there was no significant effect on EIPH severity. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Manipulations that decrease swings in intrapleural pressure may only decrease the degree of EIPH in horses severely affected by the condition.",M2
17384572,"Preoperative autologous blood donation - part I. Only two clinical parameters determine efficacy of the autologous predeposit.AIM: To improve efficacy of preoperative autologous blood donation (i.e. increase in total <e>RBC</e>-mass) it is important to know those clinical parameters that are of decisive impact for it. METHODS: Prospective study in 704 patients scheduled for major orthopaedic surgery. Donation of either one or two separately collected RBC-units, and calculation of increase in RBC-mass by the HCT-method. Qualitative statistical analysis by multiple univariate analysis of variances, correlation analysis with Pearson, multiple linear regression analysis. Quantitative statistical analysis by t-/U-test; P&lt;0.01(n &gt;or= 100), and P&lt;0.05 (n &lt;100), respectively. RESULTS: Two parameters were demonstrated of decisive impact to increase in RBC-mass to preopeative autologous blood donation (PABD) (P&lt;0.000): first, time interval between preoperative autologous blood donation and surgery, that correlated positively with efficacy; second, haematocrit-level at predeposit-session that correlated negatively with efficacy. The highest level of RBC-regeneration reached was observed four weeks after last blood donation (one unit:146.6+/-85.2 mL; two units: 297.4+/-78.6 mL). Patients with an anaemic initial haematocrit (females: &lt;or=37%; males &lt;or=40%) generated more RBC (*P&lt;0.05) than non-anaemic patients (one unit: females, 148.3+/-67.6 vs 73.8+/-65.8 mL; males, 170.5+/-81.6 vs 77.0+/- 93.9 mL. Two units: females, 295.0+/-58.5 vs 226.0+/-79.7 mL; males, 299.9+/-82.5 vs 234.6+/- 107.5 mL). CONCLUSIONS: To improve efficacy of preoperative autologous blood donation, a time interval between (last) autologous predeposit and surgery of at least 4 weeks should remain for efficacious RBC-regeneration; together with an acute and strong decline in haematocrit due to the autologous predeposit to push erythropoiesis as efficaciously as possible.",M2

A significant increase in the <e>RBC</e>, WBC, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values was observed in the animals pretreated with E. officinalis extract as compared to the hematological values observed in the irradiated group. Furthermore, radiation sickness was greatly inhibited in those mice that were irradiated with prior treatment of E. officinalis. A significant decrease in glutathione (GSH) content and increase in lipid peroxidation (LPx) level were also observed in irradiated animals; whereas E. officinalis pretreated irradiated animals exhibited a significant increase in GSH content and decrease in LPx level, but such remained below the normal. The results from the present study suggest that E. officinalis pretreatment provides protection against irradiation to Swiss albino mice.",M2
17325439,"Influence of red blood cell concentration on the initiation time of blood coagulation: risk of thrombus formation in pregnant females with anemia.The influence of a change in red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) concentration on the initiation time of blood coagulation (Ti) in pregnant and non-pregnant females was investigated using a damped oscillation rheometer to evaluate the risk of hemorrhagic tendency or thrombus formation. The blood samples from 40 female volunteers (20 pregnants and 20 non-pregnants) were examined. After centrifuging some portion of each blood sample, an appropriate volume was taken from the RBC layer to make an artificially diluted blood, or to add it to the autologous blood, making an artificially concentrated blood. The Ti of non-pregnant females was significantly reduced with increasing the RBC concentration from 3.75+/-0.25 to (5.75+/-0.25)x10(6)/mm(3). However, the Ti of pregnant females showed almost no change in the RBC concentrations from 3.25+/-0.25 to (5.25+/-0.25)x10(6)/mm(3). These results suggest that RBC concentration plays an important role in accelerating the initial coagulation reaction of blood of non-pregnant females and that a hypercoagulant condition caused by pregnancy conceals the effect that changes in RBC concentration have in pregnant females.",M2
17318417,"An assessment of recombinant human erythropoietin effect on reticulocyte production rate and lifespan distribution in healthy subjects.PURPOSE: An empirical pharmacodynamic model was developed to assess the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHu-EPO) treatment on the reticulocyte production rate and lifespan distribution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single doses of rHu-EPO at levels 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, and 160 kIU were administered to healthy volunteers (n = 8 per dose level). Erythropoietin plasma concentrations as well as hematologic responses were measured up to 42 days. The hematological data were used to determine explicit relationships between reticulocyte and red blood cell counts (<e>RBC</e>) and the reticulocytes' production rate and lifespan distribution. RESULTS: The parameter estimates obtained by simultaneous fitting of the model to the reticulocyte and RBC data revealed that rHu-EPO transiently increased the reticulocyte lifespan from the baseline value of 1.7 days to 3.4 days and the effect lasted for 8.3 days. The dose dependent increase in the reticulocyte production had the maximal value of 77.5 10(9) cells/l/day and was followed by a rebound that was less than 9% of the baseline value. Both reticulocyte and RBC responses were preceded by a dose-independent lag time of 1.7 days. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of rHu-EPO on the reticulocyte production rate and lifespan distribution was characterized. The results of the present study can be further utilized in building more mechanistic pharmacodynamic models of rHu-EPO stimulatory effects.",M2
17311196,"Artifactual changes in PCV, hemoglobin concentration, and cell counts in bovine, caprine, and porcine blood stored at room and refrigerator temperatures.BACKGROUND: Blood samples collected from farm animals for hematology testing may not reach the laboratory or be examined immediately upon collection, and in some cases may need to be transported for hours before reaching a laboratory. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the artifactual changes that may occur in PCV, hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration, and cell counts in bovine, caprine, and porcine blood samples stored at room (30 degrees C) or refrigerator (5 degrees C) temperature. METHODS: Baseline values for PCV, Hgb concentration, and <e>RBC</e> and WBC counts were determined immediately after blood collection from 36 cattle, 32 goats, and 48 pigs using manual techniques. Blood samples were split into 2 aliquots and stored at 30 degrees C or 5 degrees C. Hematologic analyses were carried out at specified intervals during 120 hours of storage. Results were analyzed by repeated measure ANOVA; results at different temperatures were compared by paired t-tests. RESULTS: Compared to baseline values, there were no significant changes in Hgb concentration, RBC count, or WBC count in samples from cattle; in Hgb concentration and RBC count in samples from goats; and in Hgb concentration and WBC count in samples from pigs throughout the 120 hours of storage at both 30 degrees C and 5 degrees C. Significant changes (P &lt;.05) from baseline occurred in PCV after 14 hours of storage at 30 degrees C and after 19 hours of storage at 5 degrees C in cattle and goats; and after 10 hours of storage at 30 degrees C and 14 hours of storage at 5 degrees C in pigs. Significant changes also were observed in Hgb concentration at 96 hours at 30 degrees C and 5 degrees C, and in RBC counts at 48 hours at 30 degrees C and 96 hours at 5 degrees C in porcine samples; and in total WBC counts at 120 hours at 30 degrees C and 5 degrees C in caprine samples. Artifactual changes were more pronounced in the samples stored at 30 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: At both 30 degrees C and 5 degrees C, blood samples from cattle and goats can be stored for up to 12 hours, while blood samples from pigs can be stored for up to 8 hours without any significant changes in PCV. Blood samples from all 3 species can be stored for more than 24 hours without significant changes in Hgb concentration, RBC count, and total WBC count.",M2
17311191,"Hematologic and biochemical changes during canine agility competitions.BACKGROUND: Normal response to different types of exercise needs to be established before performance, training level, or exercise intolerance can be assessed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this research was to describe the hematologic and biochemical changes that dogs undergo during an agility competition. METHODS: Fifteen dogs were subjected to an agility test that covered a distance of 360-400 m with 40 obstacles. Basal venous blood samples were drawn 1 week before the competition, immediately after exercise, and at 5, 15, and 30 minutes of recuperation. A CBC, plasma biochemical profile, and lactate concentration were determined by standard methods using automated analyzers. Serum cortisol concentration was measured by competitive immune-enzyme analysis; insulin was measured by sandwich ELISA. RESULTS: Hematologic response to the agility test consisted of significant increases in <e>RBC</e> count, hemoglobin concentration, and HCT, with no change in total protein concentration. Serum triglyceride concentrations were increased postexercise, with highest values observed at 30 minutes of recuperation. Postexercise lactate concentrations exceeded the anaerobic threshold of 4 mmol/L. Serum lactate dehydrogenase activity was significantly higher after 30 minutes of recuperation. Significant differences were not observed in other analytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that agility competitions induce mild to moderate changes in hematologic and biochemical results consistent with splenic contraction, increased lipolysis, and utilization of anaerobic pathways involved in energy resynthesis in muscle.",M2
17242654,"Preoperative autologous blood donation - part II. Adapting the predeposit concept to the physiological basics of erythropoiesis improves its efficacy.AIM: Only two clinical parameters have been demonstrated to be of decisive impact on efficacy [i.e. increase in red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>)]-mass] of the autologous predeposit; the time interval between predeposit and elective surgery that correlates positively with increase in RBC-mass, and the haematocrit-level at predeposit that correlates negatively with it. These two determinants of efficacy might be applied most efficaciously by combining them within one predeposit-session. METHODS: Prospective study concerning the efficacy of two different autologous predeposit-concepts in osteoarthritis (n=160) and rheumatoid arthritis patients (n=74); the conventional ''two separately collected units concept'' (one RBC-unit each on two separate predeposit-sessions) and the new ''one double deposit'' concept (two RBC-units on one predeposit-session). The increase in RBC-mass was calculated with the haematocrit-method. Statistical analysis by ANOVA with post-hoc-test to Scheffé/H-test, and U-test; P&lt;0.05 with Bonferroni-correction when appropriate. RESULTS: In either group of patients, increase in RBC-mass was higher with the new than the conventional predeposit concept (osteoarthritis: 261+/-114 vs 168+/-133 mL; P&lt;0.000; rheumatoid arthritis: 239+/-112 vs 149+/-152 mL; P=0.039). Efficacy of either concept between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients was not different (new concept: 261+/-114 vs 238+/-112; P=0.765; conventional concept: 168+/-133 vs 149+/-152; P=0.941). CONCLUSIONS: An autologous predeposit-concept considering the physiological basics of erythropoiesis (i.e. long time-interval between predeposit and elective surgery for RBC-regeneration, and a low haematocrit-level at/after autologous predeposit in order to stimulate erythrpoiesis) enhances RBC-recovery in a clinically relevant extent both in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients. Concerning efficacy of autologous predeposit, no differences were demonstrated between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients.",M2
17224005,"Spurious counts and spurious results on haematology analysers: a review. Part II: white blood cells, red blood cells, haemoglobin, red cell indices and reticulocytes.Haematology analysers provide quick and accurate results in most situations. However, spurious results, related either to platelets (part I of this report) or to other parameters from the cell blood count (CBC) may be observed in several instances. Spuriously low white blood cell (WBC) counts may be observed because of agglutination in the presence of ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA). Cryoglobulins, lipids, insufficiently lysed red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>), erythroblasts and platelet aggregates are common situations increasing WBC counts. In most of these instances flagging and/or an abnormal WBC differential scattergram will alert the operator. Several situations lead to abnormal haemoglobin measurement or to abnormal RBC count, including lipids, agglutinins, cryoglobulins and elevated WBC counts. Mean (red) cell volume (MCV) may be also subject to spurious determination, because of agglutinins, excess of glucose or salts and technological considerations. In turn, abnormality related to one measured parameter will lead to abnormal calculated RBC indices: mean cell haemoglobin content (MCHC) is certainly the most important RBC indices to consider, as it is as important as flags generated by the haematology analysers (HA) in alerting the user to a spurious result. In many circumstances, several of the measured parameters from CBC may be altered, and the discovery of a spurious change on one parameter frequently means that the validity of other parameters should be considered. Sensitive flags now allow the identification of several spurious counts, but only the most sophisticated HA have optimal flagging and more simple HA, especially those without a WBC differential scattergram, do not possess the same sensitivity for detecting anomalous results. Reticulocytes are integrated now into the CBC in many HA, and several situations may lead to abnormal counts.",M2
17211457,"Increase in weight induced by muraglitazar, a dual PPARalpha/gamma agonist, in db/db mice: adipogenesis/or oedema?BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Muraglitazar, a dual PPARalpha/gamma agonist, caused a robust increase in body weight in db/db mice. The purpose of the study was to see if this increase in weight was due to oedema and/or adipogenesis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The affinity of muraglitazar at PPARalpha/gamma receptors was characterized using transactivation assays. Pre-adipocyte differentiation, expression of genes for adipogenesis (aP2), fatty acid oxidation (ACO) and sodium reabsorption (ENaCgamma and Na+, K+-ATPase); haemodilution parameters and serum electrolytes were measured to delineate the role of muraglitazar in causing weight gain vis a vis rosiglitazone. KEY RESULTS: Treatment with muraglitazar (10 mg kg(-1)) for 14 days significantly reduced plasma glucose and triglycerides. Reduction in plasma glucose was significantly greater than after similar treatment with rosiglitazone (10 mg kg(-1)). A marked increase in weight was also observed with muraglitazar that was significantly greater than with rosiglitazone. Muraglitazar increased aP2 mRNA and caused adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells similar to rosiglitazone. It also caused a marked increase in ACO mRNA in the liver of the treated mice. Expression of mRNA for ENaCgamma and Na+, K+-ATPase in kidneys was up-regulated after either treatment. Increased serum electrolytes and decreased <e>RBC</e> count, haemoglobin and haematocrit were observed with both muraglitazar and rosiglitazone. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Although muraglitazar has a better glucose lowering profile, it also has a greater potential for weight gain than rosiglitazone. In conclusion, muraglitazar causes both robust adipogenesis and oedema in a 14-day treatment of db/db mice as observed in humans.",M2
17188915,"Red blood cell senescence and neocytolysis in humans after high altitude acclimatization.A selective lysis of relatively young erythrocytes (neocytolysis), together with a decrease of erythropoietin (EPO) production, has been described in polycythemic, high altitude acclimatized climbers, after descent to sea level, and in astronauts, soon after exposure to weightlessness (Alfrey CP, Rice L, Udden MM, Driscoll TB. Neocytolysis may represent the physiological down-regulation of red-cell mass. Lancet 349 (1997) 1389-90). To study neocytolysis, we analysed blood samples drawn from 4 mountain climbers at sea level before and after 53 days of high altitude acclimatization (&gt; or = 4500 m). After a 6-day descent to sea level, erythropoietin (EPO) plasma levels were lower than before high altitude acclimatization (mean values: 2.5+/-3.3 versus 10+/-4.5 mIU/ml, p &lt; 0.05). Red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) populations were separated into low, middle and high density subsets, which, by physical and phenotypical criteria, were characterized as young, middle-aged and old. RBC membrane molecules CD55 and CD59 along with phosphatydylserine and CD47 were measured. The former are partially lost during RBC aging. The latter are involved in the triggering or inhibition of RBC phagocytosis by macrophages. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were done on each density subset. Young and middle-aged RBCs largely disappeared after descent from high altitude (from 4.50% (+/-3.10) and 66% (+/-6.90) to 0.19% (+/-0.07) and 1.90% (+/-0.50), respectively). Simultaneously, there was a dramatic increase of high density RBCs (from 29.50% (+/-7) to 97.90% (+/-2.00)). Furthermore, the remaining young and middle-aged RBCs had acquired a senescent-like phenotype, which may account for their increased susceptibility to phagocytosis.",M2
17185011,"Mouse bone marrow and peripheral blood erythroid cell counts are regulated by different autosomal genetic loci.Erythropoiesis is under fine control and genetic loci that affect it are likely to be important in a range of conditions. To assess the relative contributions of different genetic loci to parameters of erythropoiesis, we have measured <e>RBC</e> counts in the peripheral circulation and committed erythroid cells (RBC and small normoblasts) in the bone marrow in a cohort of (CBA/H x C57BL/6) F2 mice to map quantitative trait loci (QTL). Candidate genes were assessed using bioinformatics and DNA sequencing. Different autosomal loci affect bone marrow (chromosomes 5, 11 and 19) and peripheral blood (chromosome 4) erythroid cell counts but there may be a common chromosome X locus. Spleen weight QTL were found on chromosomes 3, 15 and 17. Surprisingly, erythropoietin (Epo) is the best candidate quantitative trait gene (QTG) in the chromosome 5 locus that affects bone marrow but not peripheral blood erythroid cell counts. Epo gene expression is known to be genetically regulated in mice, but our data suggest a tissue-specific role for epo in mouse erythropoiesis that is also genetically determined. The identity of the other QTG will be important both to further knowledge of the control of erythropoiesis and as potential modifier genes for haematological disorders.",M2
17175894,"Erythropoiesis activity, iron availability and reticulocyte hemoglobinization during treatment with hemodialysis and in subjects with uremia.In hemodialysis subjects correction of anemia is facilitated by combined supplementation of intravenous iron and recombinant human erythropoietin. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (RET-He) is considered to be an actual indicator reflecting functional iron availability for erythropoiesis. In the present study, interdependence between biochemical analytes reflecting iron status and hemocytometric parameters indicating the degree of hemoglobinization of reticulocytes and red blood cells, respectively, is established. Participants of the study were reference subjects (n=75), subjects with iron deficiency anemia (n=52), subjects with uremia (n=19) and subjects undergoing hemodialysis treatment (n=43). If compared with the reference subjects the results for <e>RBC</e> counts and MCHC are statistically significantly decreased in case of subjects with hemodialysis and uremia, whereas increased results are established with regard to RDW-sd values. Significantly increased results for absolute reticulocyte counts and immature reticulocyte fractions (IRF) are also observed in case of subjects with hemodialysis and uremia. Slightly increased values for the ZPP/heme ratio in combination with elevated reticulocyte count reflect increased activity of erythropoiesis. At a definite MCV value, decreased levels for the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes (RET-He) and hemoglobin content of red blood cells (RBC-He) are observed in case of subjects treated with hemodialysis and in subjects with uremia if compared with identical MCV values of the group of reference subjects. For the ratio of RET-He and RBC-He obviously decreased results are demonstrated in case of subjects with iron deficiency anemia (1.02 +/- 0.08, mean +/- SD), hemodialysis (1.05 +/- 0.05) and uremia (1.02 +/- 0.10) if compared with the group of reference subjects (1.11 +/- 0.02). From the combined interpretation of the MCV values within the reference range and decreased values for RET-He and RET-He/RBC-He ratios, respectively, a decreased degree of hemoglobinization is concluded in the case of subjects with hemodialysis or uremia. The conclusion implicating the presumption of reduced functional availability of iron for hemoglobin synthesis is supported by the detection of increased results for sTfR concentrations and ZPP/heme ratios.",M2
17157895,"Blood lead levels in children aged 5-9 years living in Cartagena, Colombia.During June-August 2004, blood lead (BPb) levels and various hematological parameters were evaluated in children aged 5-9 years old at ten primary schools located in eight neighborhoods in Cartagena, Colombia. The schools selected for this study are attended mainly by children from families of low income. A total of 189 subjects participated in the survey. The arithmetic mean+/-standard error BPb level was 5.49+/-0.23 microg/dL (range&lt;1.0-21.0 microg/dL). The geometric mean was 4.74 microg/dL (95% CI: 4.29-5.18). A proportion of the children (7.4%) had BPb levels above the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's threshold of concern (10 microg Pb/dL). BPb levels were correlated weakly, but significantly and positively, with red blood cell count (<e>RBC</e>), and negatively with child body size, age, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). BPb levels did not differ significantly between boys and girls but significant differences were observed between neighborhoods (P&lt;0.001). Activities such as metal melting-related processes and fishing net sinker production are the main sources of Pb exposure in Cartagena.",M2
17111750,"Haematological values in pregnant women in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been documented regarding the statistical significance of variations in some haematological parameters at different trimesters of pregnancy. Environmental factors, ethnic and tribal peculiarities have variously been implicated. The values of eight important haematological parameters: Haematocrit (Hct), Haemoglobin concentration (Hbc), Red Blood Cell (<e>RBC</e>) count, White Blood Cell (WBC) count, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin (MCH), Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) were therefore determined in healthy pregnant subjects receiving antenatal care at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Port Harcourt, Nigeria. METHOD: Cross-sectional prospective study involving 130 pregnant subjects aged between 18 and 43 years. The subjects were divided into three groups consisting of 46 subjects in the first trimester, 36 subjects in the second trimester and 48 subjects in the third trimester of pregnancy. The height, weight and body mass index of all subjects were also determined. RESULTS: Results obtained for the haematological parameters indicate that only Haematocrit (Hct) showed significant differences amongst the three groups; highest amongst subjects in the third trimester and lowest amongst subjects in the second trimester (p &lt; 0.05). Haemoglobin concentration (Hbc), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin (MCH), Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) were found to be highest amongst subjects in the second trimester; Red Blood Cell (RBC) count and White Blood Cell (WBC) count were highest amongst subjects in the first trimester of pregnancy. These differences were however, not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). Among the anthropometric parameters studied, only weight showed significant differences in the three groups of pregnant subjects (p &lt; 0.05); being highest amongst subjects in the third trimester and lowest in subjects in the first trimester. CONCLUSION: The present study provides additional baseline data for basic haematological parameters in healthy pregnant Nigerian women. This would be of immense benefit especially in the antenatal assessment of pregnant Nigerian women.",M2
16973883,"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling of recombinant human erythropoietin after intravenous and subcutaneous administration in rats.The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) were studied in rats after single i.v. and s.c. administration at three dose levels (450, 1350, and 4050 IU/kg). The plasma concentrations of rHuEPO and its erythropoietic effects including reticulocyte (RET), red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>), and hemoglobin (Hb) levels were determined. A two-compartment model with dual input rate and nonlinear disposition was used to characterize the PK of rHuEPO. The catenary indirect response model with several compartments reflecting the bone marrow and circulating erythropoietic cells was applied. The s.c. doses exhibited slow absorption (T(max) = 12 h) and incomplete bioavailability (F = 0.59). In placebo groups, RBC and Hb values gradually increased over time with growth of the rats, and the changes in the baselines monitored from 8 to 32 weeks of age were described by a nonlinear growth function. All doses resulted in dose-dependent increases in RET counts followed by an immediate decline below the baseline at around 6 days and returned to the predose level in 21-24 days after dosing. A subsequent steady increase of RBC and Hb levels followed and reached peaks at 6 days. A tolerance phenomenon observed at all dose levels was modeled by a negative feedback inhibition with the relative change in Hb level. The PK/PD model well described the erythropoietic effects of rHuEPO as well as tolerance, thereby yielding important PD parameters (S(max) = 1.87 and SC(50) = 65.37 mIU/ml) and mean lifespans of major erythropoietic cell populations in rats.",M2
16934509,"The influence of dietary vitamin C and E supplementation on the physiological response of pirarucu, Arapaima gigas, in net culture.This study evaluated the efficacy of dietary vitamin C (ascorbic acid or AA), vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol or alpha-T), and C+E supplementation on the blood parameters of Arapaima gigas grown in net cages for 45 days. Four treatments were tested: control (commercial feed); C800; E500 and C+E (800+500) with supplementation of 800 mg AA kg(-1), 500 mg alpha-T kg(-1) and 800+500 mg AA+alpha-T kg(-1), respectively. Hematocrit (Ht), red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>), and hemoglobin concentration (Hb) (oxidative status indicators), thrombocytes and leukocytes (immunological indicators), plasma protein and glucose were evaluated. Fish fed vitamin C and C+E supplemented diets showed greater weight gain and survival. Dietary vitamin C and C+E diet supplementation resulted in increased Ht, Hb, RBC, MCHC, total leukocytes, total proteins, thrombocytes and eosinophils compared to the control and alpha-T. The alpha-tocopherol-supplemented diet reduced the number of total thrombocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils and increased glucose and eosinophils relatively to the control. In general, leukocytes and thrombocytes were good indicators of the efficiency of vitamin on the defense mechanism of the A. gigas reared in cages. Results indicate that high alpha-T diet supplementation provides no benefit for the maintenance of the oxidative or the immunological status of A. gigas. However, it was demonstrated that high dietary AA improves A. gigas immunological status. Red blood cell indices and immune system indicators showed no synergistic effect between the vitamins after supplementing the A. gigas diet with alpha-T+AA.",M2
16917885,"Menstruation does not cause anemia: endometrial thickness correlates positively with erythrocyte count and hemoglobin concentration in premenopausal women.Menstruation has often been cited as a risk factor for iron-deficiency anemia. This study tested whether normal, premenopausal women's luteal endometrial thickness (ET) was associated with their red blood cell count (<e>RBC</e>) and hemoglobin concentrations (Hg), and therefore whether a high ET put women at risk for anemia. Endometrial thickness can be considered a reasonable proxy for menstrual blood loss in normal women. Twenty-six healthy women from the Mogielica Human Ecology Study Site in Poland, aged 20-40 years (29 +/- 5.3 years, mean +/- SD), were selected. Subjects' ET was measured by transvaginal ultrasound in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and their red blood cell count and hemoglobin concentrations were measured by fasting morning blood samples. Controlling for day of ET measurement, RBC and Hg were positively correlated with ET (r(2) = 0.24, P = 0.05; r(2) = 0.25, P = 0.04, respectively). We propose that, contrary to popular understanding, a thicker endometrium suggests greater iron reserves, rather than greater risk for anemia, in healthy women.",M2
16899916,"Whole blood viscosity and erythrocyte hematometric indices in chronic heroin addicts.Whole blood viscosity (WBV) and hematometric indices of erythrocytes as red blood cell count (<e>RBC</e>), mean erythrocyte volume (MCV), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean hemoglobin content of erythrocytes (MCH), HGB/HCT values (MCHC) and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) have been studied in a group of 15 chronic opioid addicts under methadone maintenance therapy with mean age 26.53 +/- 7.34 years. WBV elevation and changes in MCV, HGB, HCT, RDW were found in intravenous drug users compared to healthy individuals. As well, RBC was decreased leading to an increase in MCH and MCHC values. Correlation analysis suggested that the correlation among the RBC, HGB, HCT and WBV was the closest. Heroin macrocytosis (heroin macrocytic anemia) was established, related with the increased RDW in chronic heroin abusers. The results are in accordance with data revealing abnormal effects of alcohol and other drugs on whole blood rheology and hematometric/morphometric characteristics of erythrocytes.",M2
16863009,"Association of insulin resistance and hematologic parameters: study of a middle-aged and elderly Chinese population in Taiwan.BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation is a common feature related to changes in hematologic parameters in insulin resistance. The aims of this study were to explore the relationship between hematologic parameters and insulin resistance, and to establish a gerontologic profile for following studies. METHODS: Residents aged over 40 years in 3 major townships in I-Lan County participating in the Adult Health Examination were invited for the study. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) was done according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Insulin resistance was measured by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), and subjects with the highest tertile of HOMA-IR were defined as being insulin resistant. Hematologic parameters including white blood cell (WBC) count, red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) count, hemoglobin, and platelet count were measured for comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 857 subjects (mean age, 64.6 +/- 11.2 years; male/female, 373/484) participated in this study. Their mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.5 +/- 3.7 kg/m2, and 42.4% of them were obese and 21.8% were overweight. The overall prevalence of DM was 15.4% (7.7% were previously diagnosed and 7.7% were newly diagnosed), and impaired fasting glucose was 7.2%. Trend analyses confirmed that age, BMI, HOMA-IR, WBC and platelet counts were significantly increased as glycemic metabolism exacerbated (p = 0.007, &lt; 0.001, &lt; 0.001, &lt; 0.001 and 0.025, respectively). Compared with insulin-sensitive subjects, insulin-resistant subjects were more likely to be females (70.2% vs. 49.7%, p &lt; 0.001), and had significantly higher BMI (26.2 +/- 3.9 kg/m2 vs. 23.7 +/- 3.3 kg/m2, p &lt; 0.001), HOMA-IR (3.6 +/- 3.5 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.3, p &lt; 0.001), WBC count (6686.9 +/- 1889.2/mm3 vs. 5942.9 +/- 1740.4/mm3, p &lt; 0.001), and platelet count (243.5 +/- 70.9 x 10(3)/mm3 vs. 231.0 +/- 62.2 x 10(3)/mm3, p = 0.011), but not age (64.5 +/- 11.0 years vs. 64.6 +/- 11.4 years, p = 0.93) or RBC count (4.6 +/- 0.6 M/mm3 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.6 M/mm3, p = 0.76). When age and sex were controlled, HOMA-IR significantly correlated with WBC count (gamma = 0.23, p &lt; 0.001) and platelet count (gamma = 0.09, p = 0.007). However, by multiple logistic regression, female gender, overweight and obesity, and elevated WBC count were all found to be independent risk factors of insulin resistance, but age, RBC and platelet counts were not. CONCLUSION: Elevated WBC count but not RBC count was significantly associated with insulin resistance and glycemic metabolism. The relationship between platelet count and insulin resistance deserves further investigations.",M2
16841757,"Pathological effects of Arcobacter cryaerophilus infection in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum).Arcobacter cryaerophilus was isolated from naturally infected rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum), and its pathogenicity was tested by intramuscular injection into 40 healthy 1-year-old rainbow trout at 16 degrees C. The lethal dosage of 50% end point (LD50) for A. cryaerophilus was calculated 2.25 x 10(4) viable cells. Experimental infection caused deaths with gross clinical abnormalities such as degenerated opercula and gills, liver damage, haemorrhagic kidney and serous fluid in swollen intestines. The counts of A. cryaerophilus in kidney, liver and gills of experimentally infected fish ranged from 1.59 x 10(10) colony forming units (cfu)/g to 7.41 x 10(12) cfu/g. The means of erythrocyte (<e>RBC</e>) count, haematocrit level, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, albumin and total protein concentrations in the blood of the experimentally infected rainbow trout group were significantly lower than in the healthy fish. Leukocyte (WBC) counts of the experimentally infected rainbow trout were significantly higher than those of healthy fish. The present work shows that the selected blood characteristics may be good indicators of response to infections in rainbow trout.",M2
16755361,"The evaluation of coagulation profiles in calves with suspected septic shock.The purpose of the study reported here was to evaluate the haemostatic function in calves with suspected septic shock and to reflect the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Twenty-six calves suspected of having septic shock (experimental group) and 10 clinically healthy calves (control group) were used. On admission, the experimental group of calves had been ill for an average of 2 days. Therapy was applied to the experimental group of calves. The packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin (Hb), white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) and platelet (PLT) counts were determined. Blood smears for toxic neutrophil and schistocyte intensity were evaluated. For the coagulation profile, plasma activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) values were determined. Toxic neutrophils in blood smears were observed in 12 calves of the experimental group. APTT was prolonged in the experimental group compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Fibrinogen concentration was found to be higher in the experimental group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). Total leukocyte counts were higher in the experimental group compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.01). Platelet counts in the experimental group were lower than the control group (p &lt; 0.001). However, when the individual values of coagulation profiles of each calf were evaluated, 8 calves had at least three abnormal coagulation profiles (APTT &gt;72 s, PT &gt;34.5 s, TT &gt;33.7 s, FDPs &gt;5 microg/ml, PLT &lt; or = 150 x 10(3)/mm(3)) and abnormal erythrocyte morphology (schistocytes &gt; or = 1). The most common abnormal tests in the coagulation profile were APTT and PT (7 cases), FDPs (6 cases), thrombocytopenia (4 cases), and schistocytes in blood smears (8 cases) in these 8 calves. The results of this study indicate that DIC might be a significant risk factor for mortality in calves with suspected septic shock.",M2
16751135,"Reticulocyte-gated flow cytometric analysis of red blood cells in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by the deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins in the affected blood cell membranes. Analysis of blood cells by flow cytometry is useful to identify the affected blood cells with PNH-specific phenotypes. Because PNH-affected red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>) have shortened life-spans in the circulation, ratios of PNH-affected populations analyzed by flow cytometry in whole RBC are lower than those in PNH-affected erythropoiesis. We developed a reticulocyte-gated 2-color flow cytometry of RBC and revealed that the percentages of PNH-affected, CD59--populations in reticulocytes were higher than in whole RBC in patients with PNH. A serial analysis of a patient with PNH who underwent peripheral blood stem cell transplantation confirmed the usefulness of this method to evaluate PNH-affected RBC populations with high sensitivity; ie, the presence of CD59- reticulocytes in the circulation could be a sensitive marker for PNH-affected erythropoiesis.",M2
16649615,"Effect of an acute and chronic toxicity of four commercial detergents on the freshwater fish Gambusia affinis Baird &amp; Gerard.The toxic effects of four commercial detergents (two washing powders and two cakes) are reported in this paper on behavior, mortality and <e>RBC</e> counts of a freshwater fish Gambusia affinis. During acute toxicity studies (96h), surface movements of fish increased markedly for 24h, only at higher concentrations (&gt;10 ppm) of all the four detergents. Thereafter, they were lethargic and bottom dwellers similar to those exposed for a period of 30 days in the longterm ecotoxicological studies made on detergent powders at a sublethal concentration (10 ppm). The detergents exposed to fish were found slippery due to mucous secretion. Hemorrhage regions were also found on their gills. The dissolved oxygen content also decreased (10-18%) in the detergent treatments of higher concentration (&gt; 10 ppm). During acute toxicity studies, cakes (LC50 = 6.69 - 19.98ppm) were found more toxic than powders (LC50 = 18.34-20.72ppm). In comparison to the control fish, RBC counts decreased (12-64%) in the detergent exposed fish, being more pronounced among those exposed to cakes. The chronic exposure (30 days) of the fish also resulted in reduction in the RBC counts (41-58%). It is thus evident that all the four detergents are toxic to the fish Gambusia affinis.",M2
16641033,"Generation of hydroxyl radicals during ascites experimentally induced in broilers.Increased metabolic rates, pulmonary hypertension and cardiac dysfunction are the most important features of the ascites syndrome in broiler chickens. However, the mechanism of cell injury causing the pathogenesis of the syndrome is not clearly understood. Our study aimed to examine the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH*) in broiler chickens experiencing ascites. The hundred and fifty 1-d-old chickens were purchased from a local hatchery and reared in an open poultry house for 46 d. They were divided at random into three groups and ascites was induced in two groups by exposing them to low temperature or administration of triiodothyronine (T(3)). The third group served as control and was reared normally. Haematological, biochemical and pathological tests were used to determine the incidence of ascites: including total red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>), packed cell volume (PCV), release of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) and ratio of right ventricular weight to total ventricular weight (RV/TV). A salicylate hydroxylation method was used to examine the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH*) in treated groups. TWo hydroxylated salicylic acid metabolites, 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (2,3- and 2,5-DHBA), were measured by HPLC to detect the generation of OH*. An ascites syndrome was observed in T(3) and low-temperature treated groups, as shown by necropsy changes and increases in f RBC, PCV, ALT, AST and the ratio of RV/TV. Concentrations of 2,3- and 2,5-DHBA were increased in groups experiencing ascites compared to control group. It is suggested that reactive oxygen species that is OH* ions, may be involved in the pathogenesis of the ascites syndrome in broiler chickens.",M2
16607233,"Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of once-weekly subcutaneous epoetin alfa in critically ill patients: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To describe the erythropoietin pharmacokinetic profile after once-weekly epoetin alfa treatment in critically ill patients. Secondary objectives were to compare pharmacodynamic and safety profiles between active treatment and placebo in these patients. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Medical, surgical, or mixed medical/surgical intensive care units. PATIENTS: A total of 73 anemic critically ill adults with an expected stay of &gt;3 days and a hematocrit value of &lt;38%. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 2:1 to epoetin alfa, 40,000 IU, administered subcutaneously once weekly (n=48) or matching placebo (n=25) for up to 4 wks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum erythropoietin concentration and hematologic variables (percentage reticulocytes [RETI], hemoglobin [Hb], and total red blood cell [<e>RBC</e>] counts) were measured, and area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last blood sampling time at time t (t: 120, 144, or 168 hrs) postdose (AUC0-Tlast) for these three variables was determined. Mean serum erythropoietin concentrations in placebo patients were slightly higher than typical physiologic levels of erythropoietin in healthy subjects, although not appropriate for the degree of anemia in these patients. Overall, exposure of endogenous erythropoietin in the placebo group (in terms of AUC0-Tlast) was only about 20% of exposure to exogenous erythropoietin in the epoetin alfa group. Baseline hemoglobin levels were the same in both groups (9.9 g/dL). Mean change in hemoglobin level from baseline through day 29 was 1.9 g/dL and 1.6 g/dL in the epoetin alfa and placebo groups, respectively. Mean AUC(RETI)0-Tlast was higher with epoetin alfa than with placebo and was related to the AUC of erythropoietin. There were no apparent differences in AUC(Hb)0-Tlast and AUC(RBC)0-Tlast between epoetin alfa and placebo groups, which was most likely due to bleeding and transfusion events. Epoetin alfa was safe and well tolerated, with a rate of treatment-emergent complications similar to that seen with placebo. CONCLUSION: Epoetin alfa, once weekly, augmented the erythropoietic response in critically ill patients as indicated by the increased erythropoietin levels and larger AUC(RETI)0-Tlast in treated patients.",M2
16596451,"Quantitative trait loci for baseline erythroid traits.A substantial genetic contribution underlies variation in baseline peripheral blood counts. We performed quantitative trait locus/loci (QTL) analyses to identify chromosome (Chr) regions harboring genes influencing the baseline erythroid parameters in F2 intercrosses between NZW/LacJ, SM/J, and C57BLKS/J inbred mice. We identified multiple significant QTL for red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) count, hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (CHCM). We identified four RBC count QTL: Rbcq1 (Chr 1, peak LOD score at 62 cM,), Rbcq2 (Chr 4, 60 cM), Rbcq3 (Chr 11, 34 cM), and Rbcq4 (Chr 10, 60 cM). Three MCV QTL were identified: Mcvq1 (Chr 7, 30 cM), Mvcq2 (Chr 11, 6 cM), and Mcvq3 (Chr 10, 60 cM). Single significant loci for Hgb (Hgbq1, Chr 16, 32 cM), Hct (Hctq1, Chr 3, 42 cM), and MCH (Mchq1, Chr 10, 60 cM) were identified. The data support the existence of a common RBC/MCH/MCV locus on Chr 10. Two QTL for CHCM (Chcmq1, Chr 2, 48 cM; Chcmq2, Chr 9, 44 cM) and an interaction between Chcmq2 with a locus on Chr 19 were identified. These analyses emphasize the genetic complexity underlying the regulation of erythroid peripheral blood traits in normal populations and suggest that genes not previously recognized as significantly impacting normal erythropoiesis exist.",M2

ANIMALS: 12 cats receiving methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) for the treatment of dermatologic disorders. PROCEDURE: The study was conducted as a repeated-measures design. Various baseline variables were measured, after which MPA (5 mg/kg, IM) was administered. The same variables were then measured at 3 to 6 days and at 16 to 24 days after MPA administration. Evaluations included physical examination, systolic blood pressure measurement, hematologic analysis, serum biochemical analysis, thoracic radiography, echocardiography, and total body water and plasma volume determination. RESULTS: MPA resulted in a substantial increase in serum glucose concentration at 3 to 6 days after administration. Concurrently, <e>RBC</e> count, Hct, and hemoglobin concentration as well as serum concentrations of the major extracellular electrolytes, sodium and chloride, decreased. Plasma volume increased by 13.4% (&gt; 40% in 3 cats), whereas total body water and body weight slightly decreased. All variables returned to baseline by 16 to 24 days after MPA administration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These data suggest that MPA administration in cats causes plasma volume expansion as a result of an intra to extracellular fluid shift secondary to glucocorticoid-mediated extracellular hyperglycemia. This mechanism is analogous to the plasma volume expansion that accompanies uncontrolled diabetes mellitus in humans. Any cardiovascular disorders that impair the normal compensatory mechanisms for increased plasma volume may predispose cats to CHF following MPA administration.",M2
16572338,"Systematic comparison of two methods to measure parasite density from malaria blood smears.This study was designed to directly compare the accuracy, reproducibility, and efficiency of three methods commonly used to measure blood-stage malaria parasite density from Giemsa-stained blood films. Parasites and white blood cells (WBCs) were counted in 154 thick films by two independent microscopists. Forty-six slides were read by counting parasitized red blood cells (<e>RBCs</e>) in the thin film. Using these same slides, parasites were again counted by two independent microscopists using an ocular grid. Overall, parasite densities were significantly lower and discrepancy between readers was higher when using the grid method compared to the WBC method, but there was no difference when compared to the RBC method. When one reader who had difficulty with the grid method was excluded, the discrepancy between readers was equivalent for the three methods. Densities and discrepancy between readers were indistinguishable when parasites were counted until 200 or 500 WBCs. Counting beyond 200 WBCs may not significantly improve parasite density measurements. Using an ocular grid directly measures parasites per volume rather than using a WBC per microliter conversion factor and eliminates the need to switch from the thick film to the thin film for high parasitemias. However, significant differences in densities measured by the grid method and the WBC method need to be evaluated.",M2
16516514,"Development of parameters influencing blood oxygen carrying capacity in the welcome swallow and fairy martin.Welcome swallow (Hirundo neoxena) and fairy martin (Petrochelidon ariel) nestlings develop relatively slowly. They exceed adult mass early in development, then lose weight and fledge at about adult mass, i.e. have a mass-overshoot-recession (Mor) growth profile. Development of parameters influencing blood oxygen carrying capacity (O2Cap) was documented to determine if O2Cap also reached a plateau substantially before fledging or increased continuously throughout nestling development. Hematocrit (Hct), erythrocyte count (<e>RBC</e>) and whole blood haemoglobin (Hb) increased 1.8- to 2.8-fold, so that O2Cap doubled during development in both species. Increase in Hct, Hb and RBC was not continuous, peak values occurring well before fledging, in contrast to passerines with standard growth profiles in which the increase occurs throughout nestling development and peak values occur at fledging. However, the timing of O2Cap increase differed from that in some other Mor species (e.g. shearwaters). Mean erythrocyte volume (MCV) decreased linearly throughout development by 30-41%, but mean erythrocyte haemoglobin content (MCH) remained constant, so that mean erythrocyte haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) increased linearly 1.3- to 1.5-fold. Possible reasons for the apparent differences in the timing of O2Cap increase between rapidly and slowly growing altricial species and among MOR species are discussed.",M2
16511786,"Stability of selected hematology variables in canine blood kept at room temperature in EDTA for 24 and 48 hours.BACKGROUND: Most hematologic analyses are performed within a short time of blood sampling, but samples collected at the end of a week may have to be stored for up to 2 days. The stability of hematologic constituents is poorly documented. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the results of <e>RBC</e>, WBC and platelet counts, hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration, and MCV before and after storage of canine blood at room temperature for 24 and 48 hours. METHODS: One hundred fifty-two K3-EDTA canine blood specimens from 2 veterinary hospitals were analyzed within 4 hours of collection, then 24 and 48 hours later with a Coulter T540 hematology analyzer. Results were compared by Passing-Bablock agreement, difference plots, and according to their classification as normal or abnormal based on reference intervals. RESULTS: RBC count and Hgb concentration were stable for the duration of the study. Differences in WBC and platelet counts varied with the specimen, independently of the initial value. MCV increased consistently over the 2 days. However, only a few results were misclassified. CONCLUSION: Whole blood specimens stored for up to 2 days at room temperature are suitable for cell counts and Hgb measurement. However, potential variations have to be known to avoid misinterpretations, especially near the decision limits.",M2
16500652,"Erythropoietin concentration in developing harbor seals (Phoca vitulina).Tissue hypoxia elicits the production of erythropoietin (Epo), a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production. In young diving mammals, oxygen is stored primarily in the blood, and blood oxygen stores increase significantly during the first weeks of life. In an effort to establish the role of Epo during this period of blood development, this study measured Epo concentration in plasma of 134 harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) pups and adults. Concurrent measurements of hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin concentration [Hb], and red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) counts allowed the evaluation of the effect of Epo on blood oxygen store capacity. Erythropoietin and most blood parameters varied with age. At birth, neonatal [Hb], Hct, and RBC were elevated, possibly due to the rapid expansion of plasma volume associated with growth rates of 0.5 kg/day. In contrast, Epo concentration increased from 6.64 +/- 0.83 mU/ml in newborns to 9.53 +/- 0.86 mU/ml in early nursing pups. Erythropoietin concentration remained elevated above newborn and adult concentration (5.71 +/- 0.79 mU/ml) through weaning, suggesting that Epo was responding to tissue hypoxia brought on by early anemia. Since similar changes in erythropoietin have been documented in terrestrial mammals, it appears that Epo plays a similar role in the blood development of harbor seals.",M2
16496168,"A cost utility analysis of the right method for screening hemoglobin E among Thai pregnant women.BACKGROUND: Inherited hemoglobin disorders are an important problem in many developing countries including Thailand. Of the several inherited hemoglobin disorders, hemoglobin E (HbE) (beta 26, GAG-AAG, Glu-Lys) is the most common hemoglobinopathy in Thailand. Presently, screening to identify carriers of hemoglobin disorders among pregnant subjects is an interesting topic in antenatal care in Thailand. Of late, many trials have been conducted to identify the right screening methods for the detection of hemoglobin disorders among Thai pregnant women. The common screening methods include red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) index determination, application of mathematical model and hemoglobin electrophoresis. METHODS: Here, the author presents an evaluation of the cost utility of those tests in medical practice in Thailand. The cost/utility of hemoglobin electrophoresis is the highest followed by RBC index determination, application of mathematical model and DCIP test. RESULTS: Here, it can be shown that the cost per accurate diagnosis for DCIP is the least expensive. CONCLUSION: It is interesting to note that DCIP also posed high sensitivity in the screening for HbE disorder. Therefore, this test is the best method for screening the population, particularly pregnant women, to identify carriers of hemoglobin disorders. It should be recommended as part of antenatal care in Thailand as well as its neighbouring countries which have a similar high rate of HbE disorder.",M2
16489329,"Unexpected changes in blood pressure and hematological parameters among fasting and nonfasting workers during Ramadan in Indonesia.OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of Ramadan fasting on basic hematological parameters, in addition to the effects on body weight and blood pressure of fasters and nonfasters. DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: One hundred male outdoor workers at a vehicle terminal in a city in East Java were recruited for this study. Anthropometric measurements and blood sampling were conducted on two separate occasions, just before the start of Ramadan and in the third week of the month of Ramadan (October-November 2004). The degree of subjective compliance with Ramadan fasting (complete, partial, or none) was evaluated using a questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean body mass index (BMI) of the fasting group was, as expected, significantly lower at the second sampling period, and the decrease in BMI correlated significantly with decreased blood pressure in this group. The blood pressure was also reduced in the partial fasting and nonfasting groups, which was an unexpected result. While red blood cell production was suppressed, as evidenced by lower levels of hemoglobin, red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>), and packed cell volume (PCV) at the second sampling, the subjects were normocytic and normochromic, based on normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that, regardless of fasting status, blood pressure is lower and RBC production is suppressed in subjects during the Ramadan period. These findings should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of Ramadan on the general population. To avoid the adverse effects of anemia, increased intake of iron-rich foodstuffs is recommended during the Ramadan month, regardless of fasting practice.",M2
16445704,"Prostacyclin causes splenic dilation and haematological change in dogs.1. The effect of vasodilators on spleen volume and the blood storage function is not yet well elucidated. To this end, in the present study the effects of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator, on splenic diameter and blood cell concentrations in arterial and splenic venous blood were evaluated in anaesthetized dogs. 2. The main splenic artery and vein were dissected for measurement of splenic arterial blood flow and intra-arterial administration and for sampling of splenic venous blood, respectively. The diameter of the spleen was measured continuously by sonomicrometry. Counts of white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>) and platelets in blood sampling from the aorta and splenic vein were estimated by an automatic blood cell counter. 3. Bolus injections of prostacyclin (1-100 ng/kg) into the splenic artery produced dose-dependent increases in splenic arterial blood flow and splenic diameter associated with significant decreases in splenic venous concentrations of WBC, RBC and platelets. When splenic blood flow was kept constant, similar changes in splenic diameter and blood cell counts were observed with prostacyclin injection. 4. Splenic dilation and haematological changes induced by prostacyclin were relatively more potent than those induced by prostaglandin E(2), acetylcholine, nitroglycerin or isoproterenol when doses producing a comparable increase in splenic blood flow were compared. 5. Infusion of prostacyclin (100 ng/kg per min) into the splenic artery caused a marked increase in splenic diameter, with immediate reductions in splenic venous concentrations of WBC, RBC and platelets, followed by significant reductions in these cell counts in the general circulation. 6. These results indicate that prostacyclin produces potent and flow-independent splenic dilation that may contribute to a decrease in circulating blood cell concentrations.",M2
16427265,"D-dimer levels in pleural effusions.INTRODUCTION: D-dimer is a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin. We hypothesized that hemorrhagic pleural effusions would have greater D-dimer levels than non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions, and that persistently bloody effusions would be distinguishable from thoracentesis-induced bloody effusions by the D-dimer level. METHODS: Forty pleural effusions were studied. D-dimer levels (measured by ELISA), red blood cell (<e>RBC</e>) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and protein level was measured for each effusion. Ten effusions, five non-bloody, and five bloody were studied for each of the following disease states: parapneumonic effusion, congestive heart failure, post-coronary artery bypass grafting, and lung cancer. RESULTS: No significant difference of the D-dimer level was noted between bloody and non-bloody effusions of different disease states (P=0.286). There was no significant difference in the median D-dimer levels between all the bloody and all the non-bloody effusions (P=0.88). There was no significant difference (P=0.51) in D-dimer levels between five diseases groups when the bloody and non-bloody fluids were combined. The D-dimer levels did not correlate with the RBC count (r=0.11, P=0.48), WBC count (r=0.13, P=0.53), LDH (r=0.01, P=0.93), or protein levels (r=-0.01, P=0.93) in any of the groups. CONCLUSION: Measurement of pleural fluid D-dimer levels does not distinguish persistently bloody effusions from non-bloody effusions, and does not aid in narrowing the differential diagnosis of an effusion.",M2
16407647,"Hand strike-induced hemolysis and adaptations in iron metabolism in Basque ball players.INTRODUCTION: Basque ball players (BBPs) make repeated hand strikes to the ball which involves continuous mechanical trauma. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to describe the hematological variations and changes in iron metabolism occurring in BBPs as a result of acute and continuous practice of this special sport native to Northern Spain. METHODS: 40 healthy male subjects volunteered to participate in this study: 11 subjects who exercise moderately (control group) but do not play Basque ball sport and 29 professional BBPs were studied in two situations: before a match (BM group) and after a match (AM group). The following hematological parameters were determined: red blood cell count (<e>RBC</e>), hemoglobin and hematocrit; MCV, MCH and MCHC. The following variables were measured in serum: iron, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, proteins, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Proteins and hemoglobin were determined in urine. RESULTS: The BM group showed lower hematocrit, MCV, hemoglobin and serum transferrin levels, and higher LDH than controls. The AM group showed higher RBC, hemoglobin, serum proteins, iron, transferrin and LDH levels, lower plasma volume, and higher urine hemoglobin and protein levels than the BM group. CONCLUSIONS: Basque ball playing induces hemolysis and increases the plasma capability to quench free iron, but its clinical consequences on iron metabolism do not seem to be enough to take an iron intake proportional to the caloric intake. In order to prevent, in the long term, the development of anemia in these peculiar sportsmen, it would be useful that medical teams observe urine blood losses and oxidative stress in these BBPs.",M2
16309546,"The haemotoxicity of mitomycin in a repeat dose study in the female CD-1 mouse.Mitomycin (MMC), like many antineoplastic drugs, induces a predictable, dose-related, bone marrow depression in man and laboratory animals; this change is generally reversible. However, there is evidence that MMC may also cause a late-stage or residual bone marrow injury. The present study in female CD-1 mice investigated the haematological and bone marrow changes induced by MMC in a repeat dose study lasting 50 days. Control and MMC-treated mice were dosed intraperitoneally on eight occasions over 18 days with vehicle, or MMC at 2.5 mg/kg, autopsied (n = 6-12) at 1, 7, 14, 28, 42 and 50 days after the final dose and haematological changes investigated. Femoral nucleated bone marrow cell counts and levels of apoptosis were also evaluated and clonogenic assays carried out; serum levels of FLT3 ligand (FL) were assessed. At day 1 post-dosing, MMC induced significant reductions in <e>RBC</e>, Hb and haematocrit (HCT) values, and there were decreases in reticulocyte, platelet, and femoral nucleated cell counts (FNCC); neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte values were also significantly reduced. On days 7 and 14 post-dosing, all haematological parameters showed evidence of a return towards normal values, but at these times, and at day 28, values for RBC and FNCC remained significantly reduced in comparison with controls. At days 42 and 50 post-dosing, many haematological parameters in MMC-treated mice had returned to control levels; however, there remained evidence of late-stage effects on RBC, Hb and HCT values, and FNCC also continued to be significantly decreased. Results for granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and erythroid colonies showed a profound decrease immediately post-dosing, but a return to normal values was evident at day 50. Serum FL concentrations demonstrated very significant increases in the immediate post-dosing period, but a return to normal was seen at day 50 post-dosing; a relatively similar pattern was seen in the number of apoptotic femoral marrow nucleated cells. The histopathological examination of kidney tissues from MMC animals at day 42 and 50 post-dosing showed evidence of hydronephrosis with cortical glomerular/tubular atrophy and degeneration. It is therefore concluded that MMC administered on eight occasions over 18 days to female CD-1 mice at 2.5 mg/kg induced profound changes in haematological and bone marrow parameters in the immediate post-dosing period with a return to normal levels at day 50 post-dosing; however, there was evidence of mild but significant late-stage/residual effects on RBC and FNCC, and on cells of the erythroid lineage in the bone marrow.",M2
16478433,"Characteristics of cisternal cerebrospinal fluid associated with intracranial meningiomas in dogs: 56 cases (1985-2004).OBJECTIVE: To determine CSF characteristics associated with intracranial meningiomas in dogs. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 56 dogs with intracranial meningiomas. PROCEDURES: Medical records of dogs with a histopathologic diagnosis of intracranial meningioma, in which CSF analysis had been performed, were reviewed. Information concerning total nucleated cell counts (TNCCs) and differential nucleated cell counts, <e>RBC</e> counts, and total protein concentration in CSF; seizure history and glucocorticoid administration; and location of meningiomas was recorded. RESULTS: TNCCs &lt; 5 cells/microL were detected in 41 of 56 (73%) dogs; 5 of 56 (9%) dogs had TNCCs &gt; 50 cells/microL. Analysis of CSF revealed predominantly neutrophilic pleocytosis in &lt; 20% of dogs. There was a significant association between meningioma location (caudal portion of the cranial fossa or middle and rostral portion of the cranial fossae) and increased TNCCs (&gt; or = 5 cells/microL). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results were significantly different from those routinely reported in the veterinary literature. Neutrophilic pleocytosis, especially with TNCCs &gt; 50 cells/microL, was not typical in CSF samples from dogs with intracranial meningiomas. Neutrophilic pleocytosis may not be detected in CSF samples from dogs with meningiomas located within the middle or rostral portion of the cranial fossae.",M2
16446996,"Serum protein profile and blood cell counts in adult toads Bufo arenarum(Amphibia: Anura: Bufonidae): effects of sublethal lead acetate.Lead is a multiple-source pollutant, well known for its toxicity, of great risk both for the environment and human health. The main target organs of lead are the hematopoietic, nervous, and renal systems; there are also reports in support of its impairment effects on the reproductive and immune systems. It is well known that most of the metal is accumulated in the blood cells and that many of the deleterious effects are related to its circulating concentrations. These adverse effects have been described not only in humans but also in a number of other vertebrates such as fish and birds. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the effects of weekly administration of sublethal Pb (as acetate, 50 mg x kg(-1)) during 6 weeks on the profile of the serum proteins and blood cell counts of the adult South American toad, Bufo arenarum (Anura: Bufonidae). The electrophoretic patterns of serum proteins pointed out the presence of four fractions; the metal provoked a significant decrease in both total proteins and albumin fraction; among the globulin fractions, the G3 resulted augmented. These findings may be related to the impact of lead on the toads' hepatic cells and immune system. The number of total red blood cells (<e>RBC</e>) showed a tendency to decrease after the injections of the metal, whereas the number of white blood cells (WBC) increased significantly; the differential leukocyte counts showed a statistically significant increase in the absolute number and in the relative percentage of blast-like cells. The decrease in RBC was attributed to the negative impact of the metals on the hemoglobin synthesis. The increasing of the WBC counts may be interpreted as a consequence of the induction of proliferation of pluripotential hematopoietic cells.",M2
