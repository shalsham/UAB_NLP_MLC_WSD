15259918,"Pattern of tooth loss in Nigerian juvenile and plaque-induced chronic periodontitis patients.The aim of this study was to determine the pattern of tooth loss in chronic periodontitis patients and hence help the clinician to plan preventive treatment against the loss of these teeth. Dental record notes of all the subjects, the periapical radiographs and actual intra-oral examinations of the juvenile periodontitis patients were done to determine the number and types of tooth loss. It was observed that the pattern of tooth loss in both groups of chronic periodontitis (plaque Induced periodontitis (PIP) and juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) was different as the most frequently lost teeth in PIP was incisors and lower incisor in JP while the least lost in PIP was the upper canines and the lower premolars in JP.",M1
15259911,"Juvenile periodontitis--a review of literature.Juvenile Periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), a condition that was previously regarded as a rare disease has of recent come into the fore as a model for the study of inflammatory periodontal disease. It has also been found to be considerably more common in occurrence than previously thought. This article reviews the literature on the epidemiology, aetiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, histopathological and immunological findings, differential diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of JP. The objective of this article is to give the clinician the current opinions of researchers in all aspects of the disease as compared to previous age long views. It is observed that there are contradictory reports on the epidemiology, etiology and treatment of the disease and hence the need for further studies in these areas.",M1
12751566,"The relationship between juvenile and non-juvenile periodontitis, ABO blood groups and haemoglobin types.This study was carried out to investigate the relationship between juvenile and non-juvenile peridontitis (<e>JP</e>, non-JP), ABO blood groups and haemoglobin type. The heamoglobin electrophoresis was determined by routine technique using cellulose acetate paper and tris buffer at pH 8.5. Tile blood grouping was carried out on all specimens. Forty Nigerian adolescent individuals were investigated, twenty of which were diagnosed as having JP while the remaining 20 were diagnosed a having plaque-induced chronic periodontitis (non JP). This latter group was used as the control group. All the JP patients were either of blood group B/AB, rhesus positive while the non-JP subjects had B rhesus positive/negative, O rhesus positive/negative or AB rhesus positive. The differences between the results of the test and the control groups were statistically significant P &lt; 0.05. All the forty subjects (JP and non-JP) had the haemoglobin type A and none of them exhibited the S and C haemoglobin types. There is a need to further investigate the relationship between juvenile periodontitis, ABO blood group and the common haemoglobin types (A, AS, S, C, and SS) at molecular level.",M1
12366854,"Three case reports of aggressive periodontitis associated with Porphyromonas gingivalis in younger patients.The terms 'early onset periodontitis' (EOP) and 'juvenile periodontitis' (<e>JP</e>) were replaced by that of 'aggressive periodontitis' in a recent international workshop for the classification of periodontal diseases and conditions. The chief etiologic agent for aggressive periodontitis is considered to be Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in localized juvenile periodontitis. Porphyromonas gingivalis is also mentioned as the etiologic agent of the aggressive periodontitis, although to date its role remains questionable. This communication describes three cases of aggressive periodontitis found to be associated with P. gingivalis but not A. actinomycetemcomitans by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our findings clarify the role of P. gingivalis as an etiologic agent in this type of periodontitis and confirm its inclusion in the current definition of aggressive periodontitis.",M1
12211498,"Eikenella corrodens in subgingival plaque: relationship to age and periodontal condition.BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of Eikenella corrodens (E. corrodens) in subgingival plaque in different age and periodontitis groups and to examine whether its presence is related to periodontal diseases. METHODS: A total of 273 subgingival plaque samples from 213 periodontitis patients and 60 healthy subjects were assessed. Smears from each plaque sample were made and E. corrodens was detected by means of indirect immunofluorescent technique. Mean percentage of E. corrodens per total bacteria (distribution) was calculated in each sample. The prevalence (% of positive samples) and distribution of E. corrodens were statistically analyzed based on age or diagnosis by means of Fisher's exact test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Prevalence of E. corrodens decreased by age in the healthy control group; however, prevalence did not change in periodontitis groups. Distribution of E. corrodens was highest in juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) (2.3 +/- 1.5%) followed by post-JP (1.7 +/- 2.1%), prepubertal periodontitis (1.4 +/- 1.1%), rapidly progressive periodontitis (0.8 +/- 0.7%), adult periodontitis (0.7 +/- 0.6%), and healthy subjects (0.3 +/- 0.3%) (ANOVA, P&lt;0.0001). The &lt;20-year-old age group with periodontitis showed the highest distribution of E. corrodens (2.2 +/- 1.6%) compared to the older age groups who were either healthy or had periodontitis (ANOVA, P&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Since the distribution of E. corrodens is significantly higher in JP, post-JP, and PP, E. corrodens might play an important role in the occurrence or progression of periodontitis in young patients.",M1
10914802,"Human herpesviruses and Porphyromonas gingivalis are associated with juvenile periodontitis.BACKGROUND: Although herpesviruses have been associated with adult periodontitis, their relationship with juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) has not been established. This case-control study examined possible associations between JP and pathogenic bacteria, the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and the Epstein-Barr type 1 virus (EBV-1). METHODS: Subjects were participants in a larger survey of schoolchildren in North-Central Jamaica. Subgingival plaque samples from 15 subjects with JP, 20 with incipient periodontitis (IP), and 65 randomly-selected healthy controls were assayed for Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans using a 16S rRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identification method, and for HCMV and EBV-1 using nested PCR identification. RESULTS: Strong bivariate associations were found between JP and P. gingivalis (odds ratio [OR] = 12.7; 95% CI = 2.6, 61.4), HCMV (OR = 10.0; 95% CI = 2.7, 36.3), and A. actinomycetemcomitans (OR = 8.0; 95% CI = 2.3, 27.5), but not EBV-1. In multivariate analyses, P. gingivalis remained a significant explanatory variable (OR = 7.8; 95% CI = 1.5, 40.9); however, the associations were marginal for HCMV (OR = 4.6; 95% CI = 0.9, 22.7), and non-significant for A. actinomycetemcomitans (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 0.4, 9.7). The associations with JP and the extent of attachment loss were even stronger when both P. gingivalis and HCMV were detected together. P. gingivalis (OR = 3.9; 95% CI = 1.3, 12.0) and EBV-1 (OR = 3.3; 95% CI = 1.0, 10.3) were the only significant explanatory variables in the multivariate analysis of IP. CONCLUSIONS: P. gingivalis is the strongest and most stable indicator of periodontitis in Jamaican adolescents. Co-infection with P. gingivalis and HCMV appears to be particularly deleterious to periodontal health.",M1
10872950,"Proximal caries in juvenile periodontitis patients.BACKGROUND: Caries is recognized as the prevalent proximal dental disease in adolescents, while proximal bone loss is minimal to non-existent in this population. Adolescents demonstrating an inverse disease pattern, i.e., minimal caries and active periodontitis, could provide powerful clues with regard to both diseases. However, data are inconsistent. This study was designed to clarify this relationship by comparing proximal caries prevalence in a juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) group to a matched non-periodontally diseased control group. METHODS: Two groups (cases [JPs] and control patients [CPs]) were matched for age, sex, and race and evaluated for decayed, missing, filled teeth and surfaces (DMFS) by radiographic analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA and Student t test. The study consisted of four phases. Phase I was based on data from a previous study that failed to include race in the analysis. Thus, the original 23 JP patients (mostly African-Americans from New York City) were rematched for race as well as sex and age with CPs from Newark, NJ. The effect of water fluoridation (found in NYC) was evaluated in Phase II by matching the 23 original CPs (mostly Caucasian from NYC) with 23 CPs from NJ. Since differences were seen, we rematched our original JPs from NYC with a new set of race-matched CPs from NYC (Phase III). Finally, 13 JP patients from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) were matched with CPs from NJ (Phase IV). RESULTS: Phase I and III indicated that JP patients had significantly less proximal caries than their matched CPs (P &lt; or =0.05). Phase II confirmed the role of fluoride in caries reduction. Phase IV (NJ sample) supported our previous data and suggested that JP patients had less proximal caries than CPs (P &lt; or =0.05). CONCLUSIONS: JP patients had significantly less proximal caries than their matched CPs when groups were balanced and radiographic evaluations were performed. In-depth studies of JP patients could provide important clues about both caries and periodontal disease etiology and pathogenesis.",M1
9844265,"[Periodontitis--a ubiquitous illness]In recent years, periodontitis has been receiving increasing attention, since it not only impairs the general state of health (loss of the teeth), but also appears to have a relationship with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular illnesses (thrombocyte aggregation, insult). Periodontitis is a very frequent, chronic recurrent, unspecific bacterial inflammation of the periodontium that arises in accumulated plaques on the teeth at the gingiva. It leads to an irreversible destruction of soft tissue followed by loss of bony substance. Three types of periodontitis can be distinguished: 1. adult periodontitis (AP), 2. rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP) and juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>). Periodontitis appears to have a genetic component. Additional risk factors include juvenile diabetes mellitus and smoking. The diagnosis, prevention and treatment are discussed. The basis for prevention and treatment is individual hygiene and professional dental care.",M1
9722720,"Early-onset periodontitis associated with Down's syndrome--clinical interventional study.Individuals with Down's syndrome (DS) have an increased prevalence of periodontal disease compared with otherwise normal, age-matched control groups and other mentally handicapped patients of similar age distribution. The exaggerated immune-inflammatory response of the tissues cannot be explained by poor oral hygiene alone and might be the result of an impaired cell-mediated and humoral immunity and a deficient phagocytic system. As far as the progression and severity of destruction, the oral manifestations of DS patients are consistent with the juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) disease pattern. The purpose of the present study was 1) to assess the periodontal clinical and microbiological status of 10 DS patients aged 20 to 31 years (mean: 26.3 years) relative to that of 11 patients with cerebral palsy (CP) aged 23 to 53 years (mean: 36 years) without defective immunological functions, and 2) to determine the effect of supragingival plaque control and oral hygiene instruction in these patient groups. Subsequent to the initial examination and a professional tooth cleaning program, clinical and microbiological parameters were monitored over a period of 12 weeks. The clinical examination included the recording of plaque index (P1), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Subgingival plaque samples were always obtained from the same pocket with the highest disease activity (deepest bleeding site at baseline examination) in each subject for a morphotype analysis by dark field microscopy and for identification and quantitation of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, and Campylobacter rectus by DNA probes. The results of the baseline examinations demonstrated that DS patients and patients with cerebral palsy had inflamed gingiva associated with a high amount of plaque. The mean probing depth and percentage of sites with probing depth&gt; 4 mm corresponded to age and poor oral hygiene in CP patients. Deep pockets in DS patients demonstrated a high prevalence of periodontal disease compared with age-matched children with mental retardation and non-handicapped patients. Regarding the young age of onset, the severe destruction of periodontal tissues and pathogenesis of periodontitis in DS patients are consistent with the juvenile periodontitis disease pattern. The missing clinical benefit and alteration of the subgingival flora following supragingival plaque control in DS patients underlined the alteration in the immunological response.",M1
9210094,"Evidence of an association between functional abnormalities and defective diacylglycerol kinase activity in peripheral blood neutrophils from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis.Peripheral neutrophils from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) show functional abnormalities, such as impaired locomotion and enhanced respiratory burst activity. A defect in intracellular signalling mechanism has been proposed to be responsible for some changes, but direct evidence is lacking. In this study we have determined the activity of diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase, an enzyme controlling the DAG/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, in crude cytosolic and membrane fractions of neutrophils from 5L <e>JP</e> patients and age and gender-matched normal individuals. No difference was observed in the DAG kinase activity in subcellular fractions from unstimulated cells between the 2 groups. When normal neutrophils were stimulated with N formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), the enzyme activity was markedly increased in both subcellular fractions. In contrast, neutrophils from 3 of the 5 LJP patients tested completely failed to rise the DAG kinase activity upon chemoattractant stimulation. These data indicate that in some LJP patients the neutrophil DAG kinase may be defective. To examine whether a decrease in DAG kinase activity could account for some neutrophil abnormalities seen in LJP, normal neutrophils were treated with R59022, a DAG kinase inhibitor, that has been shown to reduce DAG kinase activity in human neutrophils. Upon stimulation with FMLP, R59022-treated normal neutrophils showed significantly reduced chemotactic response and enhanced respiratory burst activity, two typical functional abnormalities featured by LJP cells. It is concluded that a defect in DAG kinase may cause, through an abnormal accumulation of the endogenous PKC activator DAG some of the functional changes observed in neutrophils from LJP patients.",M1
8910833,"Gingival state and dental calculus in early-onset periodontitis.This study was undertaken to 1) compare the prevalence of gingival inflammation and dental calculus in adolescents with early-onset periodontitis and their matched controls and 2) assess and compare the relationship between the presence of dental calculus and the extent of gingival bleeding and attachment loss in these subjects. The study group consisted of 1,285 13 to 20 year-old individuals, 651 males and 634 females, selected from a national survey of the oral health of U.S. adolescents in 1986/1987. It included 709 (55.2%) Blacks, 224 (17.4%) Hispanics, and 352 (27.4%) Whites. Eighty-nine subjects had localized or generalized juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), 218 had incidental attachment loss (IAL), and 978 were without clinical attachment loss (controls). The controls were matched to cases on gender, race, age, and geographic location. The subjects were examined clinically to assess the percentage of sites with gingival bleeding and supragingival calculus only and subgingival calculus with or without supragingival calculus. The IAL and JP groups had significantly more gingival bleeding and subgingival calculus than the controls. Also, the JP group had significantly higher prevalence of both conditions than the IAL group. The percentage of sites with supragingival calculus was not different between the groups, but varied by ethnicity. Hispanics with JP had the highest percentage of sites with gingival bleeding and subgingival calculus, and the lowest percentage of sites with only supragingival calculus. The results demonstrate that gingival inflammation and subgingival calculus are associated with early periodontal breakdown, and contradict earlier reports of early-onset periodontitis not being associated with these factors.",M1
7623259,"Studies on the phenotypic and functional characterization of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with early-onset periodontitis.Juvenile and rapidly progressive periodontitis are grouped under the heading of patients with early-onset periodontitis (EOP). Many studies have investigated host risk factors in the etiology of EOP patients but these remain inconclusive. This study was undertaken to assess the possibility that an abnormality in the systemic lymphocyte subpopulation or function is involved in the etiology of EOP patients. Fourteen (14) patients with juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), 18 with rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP), 22 with adult periodontitis (AP), and 33 with a healthy periodontium (HP) participated in this study. Lymphocyte subsets were determined by using panels of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and fluorescent flow cytometry. T cell blastogenesis was evaluated by [3H]-thymidine uptake. Pokeweed mitogen induced immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM synthesis were detected by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There were wide distributions of values in all examinations among subjects. No significant difference could be found between the periodontitis patients and HP groups with the exception of a high CD4/CD8 ratio in all patient groups (P &lt; 0.0001) and the depressed percentages of CD3 positive cells noted in the AP patient group (P &lt; 0.0001). These results suggest that the majority of EOP patients do not show significantly different lymphocyte profiles from AP patients and HP subjects, and that lymphocyte cell dysfunctions are not always seen, even in EOP patients.",M1
7730968,"Detection of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Bacteroides forsythus in an A. actinomycetemcomitans-positive patient population.A population of 33 subjects were selected on the basis that all had tested positive for A, actinomycetemcomitans at some time during the prior 7 years. Most subjects (31/33) belonged to families with a proband with confirmed localized juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>); however, most subjects had no evidence of the typical lesions associated with JP. Two additional subjects with rapidly progressive periodontitis, known to be positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans, were also recruited. The patients with a history of JP had been treated, but were no longer enrolled in a regular maintenance program. With 3 exceptions, the subjects had not received any dental treatment or antibiotics in the past 3 months. One aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and B. forsythus in this population. The main purpose was to compare the relative sensitivity of various methods for detecting these periodontal pathogens. Pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from all the mesial surfaces and aliquots of the suspension processed for the detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans by culture and indirect immunofluorescence (IF) to serotypes a, b, and c. P. gingivalis and B. forsythus were monitored with a DNA probe and IF. With culture, A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 39.4% of the samples, at a mean level of 0.64% of the cultivable counts. With IF, A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 81.8% of the samples, at levels of 0.40, 0.79, and 0.17% of the total counts for serotypes a, b and c respectively. Overall, IF was more likely to detect A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and B. forsythus than any of the other methods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
7730965,"Bacterial-stimulated cytokine production of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients of various periodontitis categories.Periodontitis is a general term for disease categories, including juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP), and adult periodontitis (AP), which may or may not share a common etiology and pathogenesis. These disease categories are characterized by differences in progression of tissue destruction and differences in age group susceptibility, but not, to our knowledge, by differences in cytokine responses of inflammatory cells. The present study examined blood cell counts and interindividual variation in the ability of PBMC of patients in three different categories of periodontitis to produce cytokines after stimulation with different oral bacterial species in vitro. The AP group had a significantly lower production of IL-1ra when stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) (P &lt; 0.05). Streptococcus sanguis (S.s.), which is associated with normal periodontal conditions, induced extremely high levels of IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha production in all groups. The RPP group had a significantly higher number of monocytes (MC) than the AP group (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, JP patients had a significantly higher concentration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes compared to juvenile controls (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, IL-1 alpha, TNF alpha, or IL-6 production by peripheral blood MC after in vitro stimulation with oral bacterial type stains may not distinguish different categories of periodontitis. The results support the hypothesis that the cytokine IL-1ra is produced in different concentrations in the two groups: RPP and AP. Furthermore, elevated MC concentration in the RPP group compared to the AP group may be an important pathogenic feature in RPP.",M1
7994659,"[Immunoglobulin bearing cells and complement 3 in periodontal diseases]Frozen gingival tissue sections from marginal gingivitis (MG), juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), adult periodontitis (AP) patients and clinical healthy subjects (H) were immunohistochemically stained with specific antibodies to aid in identification and quantification of different Ig bearing cells in inflammatory infiltrates. IgG, IgA, IgM, K and lambda were present in all specimens studied. The numbers of Ig cells in disease groups were much greater than in H group, especially the IgG cells. The numbers of IgG cells in AP and JP were most abundant, followed by MG and H. The correlation between the number of IgG cells and the percentage of infiltrated connective tissue was obtained by linear correlation analyses (r = 0.534, P &lt; 0.001). This means that the inflammatory infiltration became heavier as the number of IgG cells increased. It is the new finding that the number of IgA cells was smaller than the IgM cells in JP, the IgA/total heavy chains ratio was much lower than other groups. The C3 deposition was found in all of the gingival specimens. In healthy gingival tissue, C3 mainly deposited in both of the surface of inflammatory cells and vessels. In diseased status C3 located not only in these two, but also in sulcular (pocket) epithelium and oral epithelium, Igs were also observed in these areas. It is suggested that immunocomplex may deposit in gingival tissue.",M1
8083797,"Sequential manifestation of different forms of early-onset periodontitis. A case report.Pathogenic bacteria constitute the primary extrinsic agent in the etiology of early onset periodontitis. However, the risk of developing periodontal disease is not equal for all individuals, suggesting host factors are involved in determining an individual's disease susceptibility. In this report, a case of an otherwise healthy female, who exhibited prepubertal periodontitis (PPP) at age 10, juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) at age 13, and rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP) at age 29 years, is presented. Microbial, immunological, and genetic features of the case are presented. PPP, JP, and RPP are considered distinct disease entities, albeit with similar pathology and pathogenesis, yet all were manifest sequentially in the same individual. This report presents the idea that certain individuals are predisposed to early-onset periodontal diseases and the early identification of risk factors is important in the management of these individuals.",M1
8158498,"Chemoluminescence generation and MTT dye reduction by polymorphonuclear leukocytes from periodontal disease patients.Alterations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) functions have been reported in patients with severe forms of some periodontal disease. In this study we evaluated the chemoluminescence generation and MTT dye reduction by human PMN in patients with juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP) and adult periodontitis (AP) during protein kinase C (PKC) activation or during the phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan. The results demonstrated that only PMNs of JP patients showed a decreased chemoluminescence generation and MTT dye reduction during the phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan (p &lt; 0.05). The time to reach the maximal peak during the PKC activation on the chemoluminescence reaction was evaluated and JP PMNs patients demonstrated a depressed value (7.0 +/- 0.4 min) compared with healthy volunteers (13.8 +/- 0.5 min). The etiology and importance of such cellular alterations in the immunopathogenesis of the periodontal disease are discussed.",M1

Results were compared with gingival samples taken from systemically and periodontally healthy subjects. T4 subsets were found to be significantly elevated in JP &amp; RPP, when compared with controls.

8158282,"beta 2-Microglobulin levels in serum and saliva of patients with juvenile periodontitis.beta 2-Microglobulin (beta 2-m) is a low-molecular-weight protein which has been suggested to play an important role in immune functions. The aim of this study was to determine beta 2-m levels in serum and saliva from patients with juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) and to compare them with those of periodontally healthy subjects. The study was performed on 11 patients with JP and 10 periodontally healthy controls (C). Clinical measurements were recorded and serum and saliva samples were obtained from the individuals. beta 2-m levels were determined using the ELISA technique. Serum beta 2-m levels were significantly higher in the JP group than in the control group. In saliva, no significant difference in beta 2-m levels between the groups was found. The higher beta 2-m levels in serum in the JP group suggest that beta 2-m may play a role as a systemic factor in the etiology and pathogenesis of JP.",M1
8370252,"Juvenile periodontitis--pattern of progression and relationship to clinical periodontal parameters.The present investigation was carried out 1) to identify subjects with juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) in a group of schoolchildren from a community with a high prevalence of periodontal diseases and with no access to preventive dental care, and 2) to study the clinical features of the disease and the progression pattern during a period of 1 yr, and the relationship of JP to clinical periodontal parameters. The periodontal condition of a group of 502 Iraqi schoolchildren (260 girls and 242 boys) was assessed radiographically and clinically at baseline. Children showing &gt; or = 3 mm arc-shaped angular radiographic bone loss at the proximal surfaces of two or more first molars and who showed clinical attachment loss at the same sites were regarded as JP patients. A second group of children with no signs of JP were randomly chosen from the study material. One year later, the JP and the non-JP groups were re-examined radiographically and clinically to assess plaque, gingivitis and presence of calculus. The results showed that nine children (1.8%) had JP. The ratio of girls to boys was 3.5:1, and of localized to generalized forms 2:1. Mesial surfaces of first molars were more often affected than distal surfaces. Clinical assessments showed a more profound loss than was depicted radiographically. All JP patients exhibited evidence of periodontal disease progression during the following year. There were no differences between JP and non-JP children with respect to gingival inflammation, dental plaque, or calculus deposits on teeth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
8322007,"Increased rate of salivary epidermal growth factor secretion in patients with juvenile periodontitis.We compared salivary epidermal growth factor (EGF) concentrations in patients with juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) and periodontally healthy controls. In initial screening of 45 JP patients and a group of healthy controls, significantly higher salivary EGF concentrations were measured in the JP patients. Subsequently, 17 JP patients who had high EGF concentrations in some of their salivary samples were chosen, and a group of age- and sex-matched controls was selected. We then examined their EGF concentrations and EGF secretion rates under standardized conditions in stimulated and unstimulated saliva and studied the expression of EGF receptor (EGF-R) in their gingival tissues. The results showed that the mean EGF concentration (pmol/ml) was slightly higher in JP patients than in controls. However, the difference was statistically significant only in stimulated saliva and when calculated per milligram salivary protein. When EGF release was measured as the rate of EGF secretion (pg/min), significantly higher values were observed in JP patients than in controls both in unstimulated and stimulated saliva. Immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) of gingival samples from JP patients and their controls revealed no quantitative or qualitative differences in the expression of EGF-R. Our results demonstrate the complex nature of salivary EGF release. The elevated rate of salivary EGF secretion in JP patients may be associated with the pathogenetic mechanisms of juvenile periodontitis.",M1
8515361,"Hydroxyproline and total protein levels in gingiva and gingival crevicular fluid in patients with juvenile, rapidly progressive, and adult periodontitis.The aim of this study was to compare hydroxyproline (Hyp) and total protein levels both in the gingiva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) from juvenile (<e>JP</e>), rapidly progressive (RPP), and adult periodontitis (AP) patients and periodontally healthy controls (C). A total of 60 individuals, 15 from each group, were studied. GCF was obtained before gingival sampling. Clinical measurements were recorded. The gingival samples were harvested by full thickness flap operation from patients and immediately after the extraction of the teeth for orthodontic reasons from controls. The samples were analyzed biochemically. GCF Hyp levels were significantly higher in the AP group than those of the RPP and C groups. The strong positive correlations between gingival and GCF Hyp levels were determined in the disease groups. Total protein levels in both the gingiva and GCF were significantly higher in disease groups. However, the differences between the disease groups were not statistically significant. Correlations between the clinical parameters and Hyp levels in gingiva and GCF were determined. The findings indicate the Hyp and total protein levels both in the gingiva and GCF appeared to be increased in the disease groups. These findings suggest that both the synthesis and degradation of collagen and total protein are elevated in periodontal disease. However, our findings do not support the concept that measurement of either Hyp or total protein levels in gingiva or GCF is a suitable or reliable criterion in determination of disease activity.",M1

The JP patients were classified into 2 groups according to the number of sites with bone loss in the permanent dentition: JP group I having 1 site with bone loss (n = 45) and JP group II having &gt; or = 2 sites with bone loss (n = 73). It was found that 35 patients (52%) of JP group II displayed 1 or more sites with bone loss in the primary dentition during the age of 5-12 years. The corresponding numbers for JP group I and the reference group were 9 (20%) and 8 (5%) respectively.

Diagnosis of JP was based on age (&lt; or = 15 years), negative medical history, and radiographic evidence of arc-shaped alveolar bone loss.

The prevalence among whites was 0.3%, with a female/male ratio 4:1; whereas among blacks the prevalence was 1.5%, with a female/male ratio approximately 1:1. Among the black JP subjects with radiographs of the mixed dentition, 85.7% presented evidence of bone loss, and of those with radiographs of the deciduous dentition, 71.4% had discernible alveolar bone loss. This study suggests that JP is much more prevalent in blacks and that it does indeed occur in the prepubertal years affecting the deciduous as well as the permanent dentitions in otherwise healthy children. These data imply the importance of including a periodontal evaluation in the examination of children, using the periodontal probe and radiographs sufficient to adequately view the alveolar bone.",M1
1308775,"Clinical studies on juvenile, rapidly progressive and adult periodontitis before and after periodontal therapy (I).The sample in the present study comprised 36 patients who were referred for treatment of periodontal disease. Twenty-four of them were early onset periodontitis (EOP) patients and 12 were adult periodontitis (AP) patients. Based upon the age, number of involved teeth and the location of diseased sites, the EOP patients were divided into two groups as juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) and rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP). All the patients were individually examined both clinically and radiographically. At a baseline examination and 3 months after active therapy, the patients were evaluated for plaque, gingivitis, probing depths and probing attachment levels. Following instruction in proper oral hygiene measures, all of the patients were subjected to periodontal treatment. Treatment comprised scaling and root-planing, occlusal adjustment, tetracycline administration and periodontal surgery with osteoplasty. Results showed that age limits between JP and RPP cannot be drawn with certainty. The mean age for the JP group was 21.83 years and was 30.58 years for the RPP group. The number of involved teeth was found to increase with age. The first molars were the most frequently affected teeth followed by the incisors. Three months after active treatment, the response of periodontal tissues to therapy both in EOP and AP groups was almost identical.",M1
1634625,"Prevalence of juvenile periodontitis in a circumpubertal population.A cross-sectional radiographic screening was performed on bite-wing pairs (BW) from 1872 10-12 year old schoolchildren in the Greater Worcester, Massachusetts area to assess the prevalence of juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>). The 3-stage screening process entailed: (1) visual identification of possible cases based upon a visual assessment of BW for interproximal crestal bone levels greater than or equal to 2 mm from the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) on greater than or equal to 1 permanent first molar; (2) identification of probable cases based upon BW from possible cases measured with a transparent ruler calibrated in millimeters; (3) finally, clinical confirmation of JP in consenting probable cases. A total of 1038 subjects were eligible to be included in the study (greater than or equal to 3 mesial sites readable). Of the 1038 eligible subjects, 117 possible and 103 probable cases were identified in stage 1 and stage 2, respectively. A total of 99 probable cases could be contacted and 43 were examined clinically. Two cases of JP were confirmed clinically in stage 3, yielding a prevalence rate of 4.6/1000. Specifically, this report defines a rate of JP in 10-12 year-old schoolchildren for the first time. In addition, these results indicate that BW can be used to identify children with JP from large data sets. However, further studies including complete clinical and radiographic examinations are necessary to determine whether this method is adequate for large epidemiologic studies.",M1
1631485,"Efficacy of bone-fill favoring treatment on juvenile periodontitis.In this study we evaluated the effect of bone-fill favoring mechanical treatment on the marginal bone level and periodontal pockets of juvenile periodontitis patients. A total of 10 patients (3 men and 7 women) 13-29 yr of age were treated until no gingivitis or periodontal pockets were present. The intensive therapy (3-8 wk) included scaling, curettage and modified Widman flaps. The maintenance therapy comprised 4 recall visits during the first year after therapy and 2-5 visits per year thereafter. The efficacy of the therapy was evaluated by radiologic measurements of bony defects (%) 12 and 16-65 months after the treatment. The results showed a significant improvement both 1 yr after treatment and at the end of the study. The bone loss was 10.1% less than prior to the treatment and no sites with new bone loss were found after therapy in any of the patients. The bulk of healing took place during the first year after the active therapy, while some further improvement was detected thereafter. Our results show that non-resective mechanical treatment allows excellent healing and regeneration of <e>JP</e> lesions. Our findings also suggest that an adequate follow-up period is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy of the treatment procedures used.",M1
1569223,"Phenotypic assessment of early onset periodontitis in sibships.Early onset periodontitis is a group of familial diseases that are not yet clearly defined by etiologic mechanisms, although some risk factors have been recognized. The disorders include a localized form of juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), and a more generalized form (GP). In a family study, 39 sibships (116 individuals, aged 13-48) were evaluated for clinical indices, neutrophil chemotaxis, and serum antibodies to A. actinomycetemcomitans (Aa). Of 77 siblings, 41 were healthy at examination. In 14 sibships, all affected persons had JP; 14 other sibships had all affected individuals with GP; and 11 had at least one sib with each form. For probands with decreased chemotaxis, 71% of affected sibs and 36% of clinically healthy sibs had decreased chemotaxis. For Aa seropositive probands, 83% of affected siblings and 65% of currently healthy sibs were also seropositive. The associations of disease with these risk factors were stronger in JP-only sibships. Some affected sibs had neither risk factor, while many currently healthy sibs had 1 or both. While these 2 factors demonstrate population association with disease, neither fits the pattern expected within families to clearly suggest a causal mechanism. The assessment of within and among family variability remains the best approach for recognition of possible causal mechanisms and sources of heterogeneity.",M1
1593411,"Re-interpretation of the evidence for X-linked dominant inheritance of juvenile periodontitis.Several studies have provided evidence supporting the inheritance of juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) in a Mendelian fashion, and both X-linked and autosomal modes of transmission have been proposed. Re-examination of the evidence for the X-linked dominant hypothesis reveals that two assumptions were crucial in favoring the X-linked rather than an autosomal hypothesis of JP transmission. The first assumption was that females are more likely than males to have JP by ratios of approximately 2.5:1. The second key observation was the reported lack of father to son transmission of the trait. However, the data that these assumptions were based on may be interpreted differently. Although the number of females reported to be affected by JP is greater than the number of affected males, this is probably a reflection of the greater number of females incorporated into these studies. When the proportions of affected males and females are examined, rather than total numbers of affected individuals, the proportion of affected males and females is similar. Additionally, the reported lack of father to son transmission for JP appears to be the result of incomplete family data. The female ascertainment bias inherent in many JP studies, compounded by the lack of male participation in such studies, appears to have resulted in the perception of a lack of male to male transmission of JP. This lack of observed father to son transmission of JP in incomplete data sets has been regarded as proof of no male to male transmission for the trait. Studies of more complete family data, however, do document father to son transmission of JP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1

Decreased chemotaxis and phagocytosis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes have also been described in these patients. The precise treatment regimen must be individualized for each patient.

1765941,"The gingival immune response to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in juvenile periodontitis.The established and advanced lesions of juvenile periodontitis-localized form (<e>JP</e>) are predominated by B-lymphocytes and plasma cells. Local immune processes may participate in protective or immunopathologic roles in the pathogenesis of this disease. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) is implicated as a primary etiologic agent in JP. An in vitro gingival explant culture system was utilized to study the specificity of immunoglobulins produced by diseased JP tissues. A dot-immunobinding assay demonstrated that 46% of the supernatant fluids (SF) from explant cultures of diseased tissues (n = 39) were positive for the presence of antibody to A.a. Y4, while 61% of autologous JP sera (n = 39) tested positive. For rapidly progressive (RP) and adult periodontitis (AP) SF, 50% and 40% were positive for A.a. Y4, respectively. Seventeen percent of SF from healthy tissue were positive for A.a. Y4. There was no significant difference between JP SF reactivities to A.a. Y4 when compared to reactivities of SF from AP and RP patients. Only 10% of JP SF were positive for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, a non-oral control microorganism. The de novo biosynthesis of antibody in JP tissue, reactive with A.a. Y4, was demonstrated with Staph Protein A isolated 14C-labeled IgG (SPAG) and the use of a dot-immunobinding assay and autoradiography. The in vitro gingival tissue explant culture system described provides a useful model for the study of the synthesis and specificity of localized immunoglobulins produced by diseased tissues of JP patients.",M1
1765937,"No female preponderance in juvenile periodontitis after correction for ascertainment bias.Juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) is generally recognized to exist in 2 clinical forms: localized and generalized. Historically, females have been reported to be affected by both forms of JP at rates of 2 to 10 times greater than males. However, evidence suggests that females are more likely than males to seek dental care. If this is true, females will be diagnosed with JP more often than males even if juvenile periodontitis is equally prevalent among males and females in the general population. Thus, previous reports of a female predominance for JP may simply reflect this selection bias. The purpose of this study was to test our hypothesis that juvenile periodontitis occurs with equal frequency in males and females after correcting for selection bias. Twenty-four juvenile periodontitis probands were ascertained from the VCU/MCV dental clinics. The families of these individuals were examined to determine the relative prevalence of JP among male and female relatives of these probands. Our results indicate that while females are 3 times more likely than males to be initially ascertained as juvenile periodontitis probands, among relatives of probands the proportion of affected males and females is equal.",M1

Subgingival plaque samples were taken on paper points from 23 diseased sites in 15 JP patients and from 7 healthy sites in 7 control subjects. Serially diluted plaque samples were plated on nonselective blood agar and on MGB agar, a selective medium for the isolation of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Fifteen or more isolated colonies from each sample (in sequence without selection) were purified for identification. The results indicated that the microflora in healthy sulci of the 7 control subjects was significantly different from that in diseased sites of JP patients. The predominant species in healthy sulci were Streptococcus spp. and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. In JP patients, Eubacterium sp. was found in significantly higher frequency and proportion.

This study was designed to study these species with Chinese JP patients using selective cultivable technique. The media used include TSBV to support H. a, TBBP to support Capno. and selective media for Bacteroides gingivalis. A total of 303 subgingival samples were collected from 43 JP, 31 gingivitis and 13 normal juvenile. It was found that the recovery rates of H. a and Capnocytophaga in JP group were higher than that in two other groups. The Black-pigmented Bacteroides had a similar recovery rate in JP and gingivitis groups, but higher than that in periodontal healthy group. The bacterial counts and the correlation analysis between bacteria findings and clinical indices were consistent with the above results.",M1
1831500,"Immunohistochemical localization of epidermal growth factor receptors in human gingival epithelia.Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a small molecular weight polypeptide which is thought to have important functions in epithelial growth and differentiation and in wound healing. EGF exerts its action on cells through binding to a cell surface receptor. Using immunohistochemistry and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the EGF receptor, we have examined gingival specimens of periodontally healthy individuals and patients with adult adult (AP) and juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), as well as epithelial cell rests of Malassez. EGF receptors were expressed at high levels on the cell surface of basal cell layers of gingival epithelium. In normal junctional epithelium, on the other hand, specific labeling was faint or negative, indicating that receptors are poorly expressed or absent in these cells. No differences were detected between uninflamed gingival specimens of periodontally healthy subjects and of patients with JP. Instead, in biopsies of inflamed tissue from AP patients, an intense cell surface labeling was revealed in proliferating epithelial cells. Moreover, the epithelial cell rests of Malassez bound the antibody intensely. The results suggest that EGF is involved in control of epithelial growth and differentiation in periodontal tissues.",M1

A 3-year longitudinal study.We studied the periodontal disease progression and the relationship between some forms of destructive periodontitis in a group of Brazilian adolescents with high prevalence of periodontal destruction, and evaluated the adequacy of reducing data by limiting the measurement of disease to first molars and by aggregating and pooling site-scores into subject-level scores. Over a period of 3 years 222 adolescents were examined annually by bite-wing radiographs. Individuals displaying arc-shaped bone lesions adjacent to greater than or equal to 2 first molars were diagnosed as juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) patients, while those with greater than or equal to 1 first molars showing vertical lesions were regarded as periodontal risk subjects. Teenagers with greater than or equal to 2 first molars exhibiting longitudinal bone loss were defined as high-risk patients. At the ages of 13 and 16 years, 3 (1.3%) and 4 (1.8%) subjects had JP, while 12 (5.4%) and 28 (12.6%) were regarded as periodontal risks; 8 (3.6%) subjects were assigned to the high-risk group; 4 (1.8%) 13-year olds had greater than or equal to 1 first molars missing; hence, no loss of posterior teeth occurred over a period of 3 years. Analyzing the data at the site-level revealed progressive loss and little fluctuation in the alveolar bone height in the high-risk group, and a more pronounced bone loss at the mesial than at the distal surfaces. Simpler data sets were constructed by aggregating some of the site-scores or by pooling these into subject-level scores.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
2072246,"The prevalence and sex ratio of juvenile periodontitis in a young racially mixed population.The need to accurately determine the prevalence of a disease is important especially in establishing treatment needs for particular population groups. Reported prevalences for juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) have varied from less than 0.1% to 17%. The use of overall prevalence values to determine treatment needs in populations which include various ethnic groups is not reliable since there is evidence that the prevalence in different groups is unequal. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and sex ratio of JP in a large group of military recruits and to compare these values between the different racial populations. Thirty-eight cases of JP were diagnosed from a group of 5,013 young male and female recruits of varying ethnic origin. The overall prevalence was 0.76% and the female:male ratio 1.1:1.0. These findings raise questions as to the continued quotation of a female:male ratio of 3:1, and provide additional evidence for an overall ratio closer to 1:1. In addition, prevalences of JP varied considerably between racial groups. Blacks had a much higher JP prevalence (2.1%) than caucasians (0.09%). Black males had a higher prevalence (3.81%) than black females (1.99%). For black recruits the F:M ratio was 0.52:1. For caucasian recruits the F:M trend is opposite (4.3:1), although the number of cases diagnosed in the caucasian group was too low to compute a true ratio. The data support studies which show that in the blacks, the disease is less prevalent in females than in males.

1831846,"Immunologic mechanisms of pathogenesis in periodontal diseases: an assessment.Principal lines of evidence that immune reactions are central to the pathogenesis of periodontitis are reviewed. Necessary components of immunologic reactions are present in gingiva in the periodontal diseases. Differences between healthy and periodontitis patients with respect to some measures of immune function further indicate that immune reactions do occur in the gingiva during periodontitis. They are probably responsible for at least some of the destruction of connective tissue and bone that occurs. Classical antibody-mediated hypersensitivity reactions probably do not provide the reasons. Mechanisms are more likely to be found in the pro-inflammatory and tissue-degrading effects of cytokines released in host-protective, antigen-specific and polyclonal responses to oral bacterial constituents or products. Some evidence suggests that limitation of clinical destruction in localized early onset periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) may in part be a function of a protective antibody response which develops after an initial rapidly progressive infection. A relatively deficient immune responsiveness may allow progression to more severe and generalized disease (RPP). Suggestions are made for studies needed to confirm suspected pathogenetic mechanisms, approach resultant targeted therapies, and test hypotheses for contrasting roles of immune reactions in different clinical expressions of periodontitis.",M1

PMN from some JP patients exhibit abnormal chemotactic responsiveness when challenged with the synthetic formyl peptide, FMLP. While investigating PMN function in JP, we found a patient in whom abnormal PMN chemotactic responses to FMLP were associated with a defective population of PMN formyl peptide receptor(s) (FPR). JP PMN failed to respond chemotactically when challenged with FMLP, but exhibited normal chemotactic responses upon exposure to purified human C5a. Furthermore, JP PMN were capable of degranulating and generating superoxide anion radicals as well as normal PMN upon exposure to FMLP. Binding studies demonstrated that JP PMN had a diminution in the number of high-affinity FPR. Studies in which FPR was radiolabeled by chemical cross-linking demonstrated that JP PMN FPR exhibited the same molecular weight and N-linked glycosylation as normal PMN FPR. JP PMN FPR, however, was more resistant to papain cleavage than normal PMN FPR. Autoradiograms obtained from 2D-PAGE of normal and JP PMN FPR demonstrated decreased amounts of FPR isoforms in JP PMN.",M1

The PCE activity in the GCF samples was 181 +/- 48 U/L in the JP group, 588 +/- 135 U/L in the RPP group, and 88.5 +/- 29.1 U/L in the control group. Saliva PCE activity levels were 9.1 +/- 1.7 U/L in the JP group, 21.8 +/- 4.5 U/L in the RPP group, and 12.7 +/- 0.8 U/L in the control group. GCF contained a higher PCE activity than saliva but a lower one than that of serum. The RPP group had a significantly higher PCE activity in both the GCF and saliva samples. No significant differences could be found regarding serum enzyme levels. Also, no significant correlations were present between biochemical values and the severity of periodontal disease. GCF may be an important source for the PCE content of saliva. It is suggested that the increased PCE activity seen in RPP patients might be caused by either the direct production of esterases by bacteria or the induction of esterases during periodontal destruction.",M1

Plasma cell (PC) counts increased significantly (p less than 0.05) with lesion severity. They were absent from epithelium and sparse in the clinically healthy control specimens. Degenerate PC tended to be more numerous within JP tissue but differences were not significant (p greater than 0.05) when compared to AP. Intact plasma cells were never seen within JP superficial connective tissue. Russell bodies were small and few in number. The presence of degenerated plasma cells indicated normal formation and release of immunoglobulins within the tissues of AP and JP. Increased counts of degenerate PC and tissue destruction in JP suggested a correlation, possibly attributable to anti-collagen antibody secretion.",M1

Biopsies from 20 patients and 3 control volunteers were examined: 5 with treated AP, 5 with untreated AP, 5 with treated JP/PJP and 5 with untreated JP/PJP. No plasma cells were seen within the epithelium from any of the biopsies examined, and they were very sparse within the connective tissue from the control specimens. In all the pathological specimens examined there was marked tissue destruction. The percentage density of plasma cells tended to be statistically significantly higher in JP/PJP than in AP, and in untreated than in treated lesions. The statistical analysis showed also that plasma cells were more abundant in a layer deep to the neutrophils lining the basement membrane. Plasma cells were also more abundant in areas of extensive histological inflammation. The plasma cells were often degenerate and such degeneration appeared more evident in JP/PJP and in areas of connective tissue devoid of vascular tissue. These findings appear to indicate an association between increase of collagen destruction and increase in plasma cell percentage density. This may relate in turn to an increase in penetration and/or virulence of components of the subgingival plaque following an increase in tissue permeability. The scarcity of Russell bodies within the plasma cells would suggest that immunoglobulin production and secretion are normal.",M1

Assessment using the under agarose technique.The locomotory behaviour of peripheral blood neutrophils (PMNs) from patients with juvenile (<e>JP</e>) and rapidly progressive (RPP) forms of early-onset periodontal disease was studied using the under agarose technique and n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) as the chemotractant. PMNs from experimental patients showed normal random, chemotactic and chemokinetic locomotory behaviour when compared with control subjects. Further investigation of single-cell movements using time-lapse video analysis also failed to show any significant differences in locomotory behaviour between the PMNs of experimental and control individuals. We conclude that differences in technique may account for much of the variation which exists in the literature with respect to PMN locomotion in periodontal disease. In the final analysis, it is difficult to dispute direct observation of moving cells, and using this approach, we have been unable to confirm the presence of any PMN locomotory defect in our series of patients with early-onset periodontal disease.",M1

The objective of this study was to determine whether the lower chemotactic response in PMNs from JP patients is associated with a defect in intracellular signal transduction, as measured by stimulus-induced changes in free cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) mobilization. We report that peptide chemoattractants such as N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and the complement fragment C5a in direct comparative studies induced lower amounts of initial Ca2+ mobilization in PMNs from JP patients than healthy controls, as monitored by intracellular fura-2 fluorescence. The initial resting levels of free cytosolic Ca2+ in PMNs from JP patients and normal individuals were found to be similar. fMLP and C5a both mobilized Ca2+ in PMNs in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of PMNs from 0.16 to 20 nM fMLP and 0.2 to 20 nM C5a resulted in elevated levels of free cytosolic Ca2+. However, above 20 nM fMLP and 5 nM C5a concentrations the extent of total Ca2+ mobilization did not differ significantly. Although fMLP and C5a caused Ca2+ mobilization in PMN cells from JP and healthy control subjects, fMLP stimulation induced higher levels of free cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization in PMN cells from healthy control subjects (141.29 +/- 25.55 nM/2 x 10(6) PMNs), than PMNs from JP patients (62.33 +/- 23.76 nM/2 x 10(6) PMNs). Similarly C5a induced higher levels of Ca2+ mobilization in PMNs from healthy control individuals (130.43 +/- 18.26 nM Ca2+/2 x 10(6) PMNs)O, when compared to JP patients (49.92 +/- 14.92 nM Ca2+/2 x 10(6) PMNs).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
2524577,"T cells and T-cell subsets in periodontal diseases.Acetone-fixed cryostat gingival tissue sections from marginal gingivitis (MG), juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), adult periodontitis (AP) patients and clinically healthy subjects (H) were immunohistochemically stained with monoclonal antibodies to aid in identification and quantification of T cells and T-cell subsets in the inflammatory infiltrates. T cells were present in all specimens studied. The number of T cells in the connective tissue (CT) zone of AP was much greater than in any other groups. The amounts of T cells in oral epithelium and sulcular (pocket) epithelium zones of diseased groups were larger than in the healthy group. There was a significant positive correlation between the number of T cells and the percentage of infiltrated connective tissue. While there were no significant differences between the mean ratios of T-helper/T-suppressor cells from diseased and healthy tissues, large individual variance existed in the three diseased groups. The existence of a high or low T4/T8 ratio in inflamed gingiva might be related to an abnormal immunoregulation.",M1
2711122,"Outer membranous vesicles and leukotoxic activity of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans from subjects with different periodontal status.Strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) from juvenile periodontitis patients (<e>JP</e>), adult periodontitis patients (AP), and 14-yr-old healthy children were tested for the correlation between leukotoxin activity and the number of outer membranous vesicles measured in electron micrographs. To determine the potential for connective tissue destruction following the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) with the bacteria, the lysosomal release of neutrophil elastase was assessed. The highest potential to kill leukocytes and to release lysosomal elastase from them was observed in the strains isolated from JP patients. No correlation existed between leukotoxic activity and the number of outer membranous vesicles per bacterium when the data from A.a. strains from all sources were combined. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between the numbers of outer membranous vesicles in the three groups tested. The only significant correlation between the number of vesicles and leukotoxicity was found in the A.a. strains derived from the mouths of healthy children.",M1
3201115,"Chemotactic response of neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes in juvenile periodontitis measured by the Leading Front method.Previous studies have implied that chemotaxis defects of neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) can be found in approximately 75% of patients with juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>). In the present study, the Leading Front (LF) method was used to study whether the chemotactic response of PMNs from JP-patients differed from that of adult periodontitis (AP) patients and periodontally healthy control individuals (C). Sixteen JP-patients, 21 AP-patients, and 13 C-individuals were studied. PMNs from each individual, and from a daily reference person were tested against three chemoattractants (N-f-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP), casein (CA), bacterial chemotactic factor (BCF] and a neutral buffer (Gey's solution (GEY]. Regardless of the test solution a greater difference among individuals could be observed in the JP-group than in the other groups. Apart from this, there were no differences among the groups as regards CA, BCF, and GEY. However, with FMLP, the PMNs of the JP-group had a significantly greater migration distance as compared to the other groups. This finding can probably be ascribed to the fact that the LF method detects other aspects of the PMN response than do the methods used for earlier studies of JP. The finding, in this study, of an enhanced PMN response in JP as regards FMLP may be a reflection of the presence of a non-uniform PMN population whose composition in JP differs from that of the other groups.",M1
3201114,"Peripheral PMN cell activity in relation to treatment of juvenile periodontitis.Ten patients with untreated juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) showing an increased generation rate of free oxygen radicals from their peripheral polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) as measured by luminol enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) were rechecked after treatment. The PMN cells from eight patients still reacted with higher CL after stimulation with Staph. aureus opsonized with autologous serum when related to pair-matched controls. The increased CL was not caused by adsorption of serum factors from untreated JP patients when assayed with healthy PMN cells. The increased CL found in peripheral PMN cells from patients with JP thus depends very little on the disease activity.",M1
3171865,"Comparison of scanning and transmission electron microscopy of the epithelial pocket wall in juvenile and adult periodontitis.Using scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy, this study compared fine structural features of the pocket walls in both juvenile and adult periodontitis (<e>JP</e> and AP, respectively) in 40 cases. Gingiva was also obtained from a control group consisting of periodontally noninvolved teeth. Clinical parameters were assessed in both JP and AP patients as well as in controls. Clinical findings showed low plaque accumulation, marked periodontal tissue destruction and less gingival inflammation in JP. Bone destruction and attachment loss were more marked in JP than in AP. AP had a higher plaque index and more evident gingival inflammation. SEM observations of JP as compared to AP showed gross distortions in pocket walls, an increased beaded appearance of microridges, and separation between pocket epithelial cells. TEM showed partially desquamated and separated superficial epithelial cells, but only in JP were fine granular precipitates observed in the intercellular spaces. The observations demonstrated structural features indicative of more prominent degenerative changes in JP than in AP. Also, these features were coincidental with a higher plaque index in AP than in JP, where clinical features (including a low plaque index) were not proportional to the epithelial destructive changes present.",M1
3165394,"Peripheral PMN cells in juvenile periodontitis. Increased release of elastase and of oxygen radicals after stimulation with opsonized bacteria.In 12 patients with juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), stimulation of peripheral polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) by opsonized bacteria showed increased release of free oxygen radicals and of elastase activity in relation to that of pair-matched healthy controls. The elastase increase was not associated with higher intracellular content of elastase, since the measurement of homogenized PMN cells did not differ between the patient group and the control group; nor did the spontaneous elastase activity of nonstimulated cells differ. Release of elastase by contaminating lymphocytes and platelets could be excluded, since no elastase activity from these cells or interference by these cells could be demonstrated in the assay system used. When formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine was used as a stimulant, the chemiluminescence in the patient PMN cells did not differ with statistical significance from their pair-matched controls. The increased release of free oxygen radicals and of elastase seems to be a characteristic of the PMN cells in juvenile periodontitis, indicating hyperactive cells with possible pathogenic effects.",M1
3164385,"Problems of genetic model testing in early onset periodontitis.Familial aggregation of early onset or juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), a disorder that varies in expression and age of onset, has been recognized for some time. Autosomal recessive and X-linked inheritance patterns have been suggested, and one large pedigree has demonstrated autosomal dominant inheritance. The variability and age limitations in clinical phenotypic diagnosis present several problems to genetic analysis, because information on members of the youngest and older generations may be lost to the analysis. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the genetic basis of JP by formal pedigree analysis and comparison of competing genetic models. Twenty-eight families were included, with general and specific autosomal models, and an X-linked model being compared. The autosomal recessive model provided the most parsimonious explanation of the data, and its likelihood was not significantly different from the more general model. Likelihoods for the sporadic (nongenetic) and X-linked models were considerably lower than the autosomal models. While comparison of genetic models suggests recessive inheritance of JP, the serious complications to pedigree analysis posed by limitations warns against acceptance of this conclusion, without more exhaustive evaluation of: (1) a more extensive collection of family data, (2) more complete investigation of the effects of age limitations on comparisons among competing models, and (3) elucidation of the importance of diagnosis and phenotype assignment of adults through past dental records.",M1
3480951,"Bacterial penetration of the pocket tissues in juvenile/postjuvenile periodontitis after the presurgical oral hygiene phase.Previous ultrastructural investigations of untreated sites of both adult and juvenile periodontitis have shown bacteria within the periodontal soft tissues. In the present study biopsies of the soft tissue walls of deep pockets from seven patients with juvenile (<e>JP</e>) or postjuvenile periodontitis (PJP) were removed at the end of the presurgical oral hygiene phase of treatment and examined in the transmission electron microscope. Bacteria were sparse, regardless of the level of tissue breakdown, both on the surface and within the superficial layers of the epithelium, deep to the basement membrane and throughout the underlying connective tissue. Of the 140 blocks from 20 biopsies, only two revealed intratissue accumulations of microorganisms. The organisms observed were gram-positive or gram-negative and appeared to be exclusively coccoid or rod-shaped. It is suggested that the reduced tissue content of bacteria reflects the establishment of adequate oral hygiene. Evidently either the tissue content of bacteria is less than has been reported previously or the host response is able to cope with residual bacteria that have penetrated the soft tissue.",M1
3316298,"Clinical immunologic and microbiologic features of active disease sites in juvenile periodontitis.Eight juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) patients with progressing disease were evaluated for clinical, immunologic, and microbiologic features. Clinically, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level were unrelated to progressing disease. Only Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was related to a marked increase in attachment loss when examined on both a site and patient basis. Eikenella corrodens was significantly elevated in progressing sites with A. actinomycetemcomitans as opposed to non-progressing sites harboring A. actinomycetemcomitans. Eikenella corrodens may function synergistically with A. actinomycetemcomitans to enhance disease in JP patients. Darkfield microscopy was of no value in distinguishing disease activity. All patients screened had elevated serum IgG levels to the same serotype of A. actinomycetemcomitans as that isolated from the subgingival flora. Other elevated serum IgG responses were noted to various organisms including F. nucleatum. B. intermedius, B. gracilus, B. gingivalis and E. corrodens.",M1
3477627,"Calcium concentrations in dental plaque of patients with juvenile and adult periodontitis.Calcium concentrations in plaque of patients with juvenile (<e>JP</e>) and adult (AP) periodontitis were compared. These calcium concentrations in JP patients were significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than in AP patients. Because JP patients are not intense calculus-formers, the finding that they have low calcium concentrations in plaque agrees with the authors' previous suggestion that calculus formation is a marker of high calcium concentrations in plaque. JP patients have good caries resistance in general, as was the case in this study. The finding that they have low calcium concentrations in plaque conflicts with the view that caries-resistant dentitions are usually associated with high concentrations of calcium in plaque.",M1
3476519,"Effect of periodontal therapy on specific antibody responses to suspected periodontopathogens.The effects of clinically successful periodontal therapy were studied in juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) and rapidly progressive periodontitis (RP) patients and compared with periodontally healthy subjects (HS). Serum samples were obtained in 35 HS prior to the study and in 12 of these subjects 3-4 years later. Serum samples were obtained from 50 JP patients initially, 9 subjects immediately following surgical therapy and 29 of these subjects 3-4 years later. RP patients provided 46 initial serum samples, 9 following therapy and 27 samples 3-4 years later. Antibody levels were determined utilizing a standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with Bacteroides gingivalis, B. ochracea, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serving as antigens. The JP patients showed an initial rise in antibody levels immediately following therapy followed by a significant decrease in antibody levels 3 to 4 years later. The RP patients did not show an early change in antibody levels but by 3 to 4 years post-therapy, antibody levels had significantly decreased. However, during this study, the antibody levels of JP and RP patients remained significantly higher when compared with HS patients.",M1

High responders to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 in juvenile and adult periodontitis.The concentration of salivary IgG and IgA and the levels of salivary IgG and IgA antibodies to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 were measured by ELISA in 205 persons including patients with juvenile and adult periodontitis as well as healthy subjects. Compared to the concentration observed in subjects with a healthy periodontium, a significantly increased concentration of salivary IgG was found in 34% of the patients with moderate adult periodontitis and in 57% of the patients with severe adult periodontitis. The level of salivary IgA was less influenced by the periodontal condition. The level of salivary IgG antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly elevated in 55% of the patients with untreated juvenile periodontitis and in 28% of the patients treated for <e>JP</e>. 28% of the patients with adult periodontitis had a significantly elevated level of IgG antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4.

3473226,"Radiographic evaluation of juvenile periodontitis (periodontosis).Of 49,380 male naval recruits who were screened for juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), 270 were clinically diagnosed as having the disease. Full-mouth radiographs identified 182 of these 270 patients as having JP with extensive bone loss on permanent first molars and/or incisors. These 182 patients, 137 (75.3%) of whom were black, were further classified into Type I: bone loss involving first molars and/or incisors and up to two additional teeth; Type II: involvement of first molars/incisors and several additional teeth; and Type III: generalized involvement (more than 14 teeth) but with bone loss notably more extensive on the first molars and/or incisors. Of the 182 patients, 129 (70.9%) were Type I; 43 (23.6%) were Type II, and 10 (5.5%) were Type III. The molars were involved more frequently than the incisors; more than one molar was always involved, with or without incisor involvement. Most cases had minimal or no radiographic caries, and 46% had demonstrable calculus. Of the remaining 88 cases from the 270 with the initial diagnosis of JP, 63 demonstrated severe bone loss on more than 14 teeth, with many of the teeth being involved to the same degree. These cases were termed rapidly progressive periodontitis. Six of the 88 cases had bone loss on only one tooth surface of the dentition. These cases were termed acute localized destruction of alveolar bone. The status of the other 19 cases could not be determined.",M1

Some samples underwent in vitro treatment with spiramycin. Oval and round yeast cells were found before and after in vivo and after in vitro spiramycin treatment. Larger numbers of yeast cells were seen after spiramycin treatment indicating that their growth might be favored after patient treatment with this antibiotic. This observation has an obvious clinical implication. Budding processes, indicating active yeast multiplication, were observed. Some yeast cells also showed the presence of glycocalyx.

Many A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates yielded both rough-surfaced and umbonate-shaped colonies (A-type), and smooth-surfaced and convex-shaped colonies (B-type), when stock cultures were streaked on agar medium. Both types of cells were identical in terms of Gram stain, cell morphology, sugar fermentation profile, nitrate reduction and cellular fatty acid composition. Sonic extracts were prepared from 32 A. actinomycetemcomitans strains isolated from patients and from 3 American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains. Sonic extracts from 8 isolates and 2 ATCC strains induced sphering of PMNs during a 45-50 min period of incubation at 37 C. Extracts from the other oral bacteria had no effects on PMN morphology. The sphered PMNs were found by their fluorochromatic-negative reactions to be damaged cells. The leukotoxic substance was heat-sensitive (56 C, 30 min), trypsin-sensitive and did not induce sphering of PMNs at 4 C. There was no clear correlation between colony type and leukotoxicity. Among 8 leukotoxic strains, 5 were isolates from an RP patient.",M1
3468125,"Bacterial penetration of pocket soft tissues in chronic adult and juvenile periodontitis cases. An ultrastructural study.This study investigates bacterial invasion of the soft tissue walls of deep pockets from cases with adult (AP) and juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>). Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine pocket soft tissue walls removed from extracted teeth from 5 patients with AP and 2 patients with JP. Bacteria were sparse throughout the epithelium and connective tissue, regardless of the level of tissue breakdown. However many inflammatory cells were seen, and these did appear to be located in regions of marked collagen loss. Accumulations of large numbers of bacteria were extremely rare and found only on the epithelial surface or in artefactual spaces within the deeper tissues. The findings indicate that the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis is not directly related to bacterial invasion. The sparse organisms within the pocket tissues probably result from passive entry rather than an invasive action. Under these circumstances, it would seem reasonable to suggest that bacterial metabolic products rather than the micro-organisms themselves penetrate the tissues in periodontitis.",M1
3537019,"Healing following surgical and non-surgical treatment of juvenile periodontitis. A 5-year longitudinal study.The patient sample used in the present study comprised 16 young individuals who were referred for treatment of advanced periodontal disease. Based upon the age of the patients and the location of the diseased sites, the patients were divided into 2 groups; a juvenile periodontitis group (<e>JP</e>) and a post-juvenile periodontitis group (post-JP). The patients in the JP group had periodontal lesions only at first molars and incisors. All 16 subjects were in excellent general health and none had been treated with antibiotics during a period of at least 12 months prior to the 1st examination. At a baseline examination and 6, 24 and 60 months after active therapy, the diseased sites were examined regarding plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depths, probing attachment level, recession of the gingival margin and marginal alveolar bone level. Following a case presentation and instruction in proper oral hygiene measures, the 16 subjects were subjected to periodontal treatment, utilizing a split mouth design. By random selection, the diseased sites in one side of the jaws were treated by scaling and root planing in conjunction with a  modified Widman flap  procedure, while in the contralateral jaw quadrants treatment was restricted to scaling and root planing. During the 1st 6 months following active therapy, the patients were subjected to professional tooth cleaning once every 4 weeks. Subsequently, the interval between the recall appointment was 3 months. 2 years after treatment, this maintenance care program was terminated. A final examination was performed 5 years after therapy. None of the patients involved in the trial received antibiotic treatment during the 5 years of observation. The findings of the present study revealed that the response of the periodontal tissues to therapy, both in the JP and the post-JP group of patients, was almost identical to that found for similar types of treatment in patients with adult periodontitis. The re-examinations performed after 6, 24 and 60 months following active therapy of JP and post-JP lesions revealed that excision of the granulation tissue in conjunction with flap elevation did not enhance the degree of probing pocket depth reduction, probing attachment gain and bone fill that occurred following meticulous root surface instrumentation.",M1
3465755,"Influence of plasma components on luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence from peripheral granulocytes in juvenile periodontitis.The generation rate of free oxygen radicals as measured by maximal light intensity of luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence from peripheral blood granulocytes (PMN) stimulated with differently opsonized Staphylococcus aureus was studied in 13 patients with juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) and pair-matched, healthy controls. Plasma proteins related to inflammation were also assayed. When stimulated with bacteria opsonized with autologous serum, the PMN from the JP patients showed a more intensive chemiluminescence than did their pair-matched controls (p less than or equal to 0.0005). The difference was consistent but slightly reduced when using heat-treated serum (p less than or equal to 0.006) or heterologous gammaglobulin (p less than or equal to 0.19) for opsonization. When testing freeze preserved sera from 11 of the compared pairs, the sera from JP patients induced a slightly higher chemiluminescence in PMN from a healthy donor (p less than or equal to 0.031). Protein analysis of the patient sera revealed a slightly higher concentration of complement 4 (p less than or equal to 0.032) and IgM (p less than or equal to 0.030) when compared with their respective pair-matched healthy controls. The influence of other blood components contaminating our assay system was checked on healthy PMN cells. Lymphocytes, platelets, relevant amounts of ADP and serum had no effect on the chemiluminescence. In conclusion, the increased chemiluminescence of peripheral blood granulocytes from patients with juvenile periodontitis seems to be related mainly to the cells. The association with free oxygen radicals and their tissue-damaging potency might be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.",M1
3464734,"Systemic antibody response of clinically characterized patients with antigens of Eubacterium brachy initially and following periodontal therapy.Eubacterium brachy, a gram-positive anaerobic rod, has been implicated by cultural studies to be associated with the microflora of periodontal diseases.

Sera from clinically healthy subjects (HS) served as controls. Sera from rapidly progressive periodontitis (RP) patients demonstrated significantly greater reactivity by ELISA than did HS when reactivity with E. brachy antigens was determined (P less than 0.05). Juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) and adult periodontitis (AP) patients did not differ in reactivity by ELISA from HS (P greater than 0.05).

3531247,"Treatment of juvenile periodontitis without antibiotics. A follow-up study.20 patients with juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) were treated with oral hygiene instruction, scaling and root planing, possibly with flap surgery but with no antibiotics. The patients were monitored after 6 to 12 years. Re-examination revealed that no probing depth of 7 mm or more existed any longer, and that sites with probing depth of 4 to 6 mm had decreased from 237 to 46. The bone loss scores had changed from 18% (range 2.0 to 48.1) to 14% (range 0 to 44.4) and the bleeding on probing scores from 39% (range 0 to 100) to 10% (range 0 to 40). Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) had neither been cultivated nor serologically tested at the initial examination. At the re-examination, it was found in 2 patients out of 20 at 5 sites. 7 patients, the 2 with positive cultures included, had elevated titers to A.a. strain Y4 in whole or parotid saliva or both. It is concluded that there is a marked improvement in the periodontal condition of these patients, and that good periodontal health in patients with JP can be reached without antibiotics.",M1

Demonstration of local immunoglobulin synthesis.The purpose of this investigation was to determine the presence and quantity of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and albumin (ALB) in specified periodontal tissues and serum from patients diagnosed as having juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), using an immunoelectrophoresis technique and to determine which portion of the lesion generated the greatest local immunoglobulin production. Serum and tissue samples were obtained from 19 patients (ages 13-21 years) who were diagnosed as having JP; 18 were female; 16 were black. Normal, diseased, and granulomatous gingival/periodontal tissues were collected during full thickness flap surgery, then minced, homogenized, and centrifuged. Supernatants containing the gingival/periodontal protein and the serum were electrophoresed against rabbit antihuman IgG and ALB. The relative IgG/ALB ratios in each specimen were plotted against known concentrations of IgG using a least squares analysis to provide evidence for local synthesis. In comparing mean IgG/ALB ratios for all tissue types, it was noted that normal gingiva did not differ significantly from serum. Diseased and granulomatous tissues, taken together or separately, had significantly higher IgG/ALB ratios than normal gingiva or serum, demonstrating that 73.6% of the IgG present was due to local synthesis. However, the greatest amounts of locally produced IgG were found in the granulomatous tissue from the deepest areas of the defects.",M1
3457042,"Host factors in juvenile periodontitis.This study was undertaken to determine whether defects in leukocyte function or in genes at the MHC play a role in the etiology of either localized (LJP) or generalized (GJP) juvenile periodontitis. Thirteen LJP and five GJP patients (ranging in age from 13 to 22 years) and their matched controls were compared with respect to selected leukocyte functions and HLA phenotypic frequencies. The results of these studies indicated that there were significant decreases in the phagocytic and chemotactic abilities of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in both LJP and GJP. All <e>JP</e> patients displayed intrinsic cell defects in chemotaxis compared with controls; in addition, some patients displayed multiple defects, including those which were serum-associated. Also, there appeared to be a significant association between JP and HLA-DR2 and HLA-A33 phenotypes. Fifty percent of the JP patients were HLA-DR2-positive, whereas only six percent of the matched controls were positive. Thirty-six percent of JP patients were HLA-A33-positive, whereas none of the controls was positive. The association seen with DR2 may be due to sampling, since there were no significant differences between the JP cases and a larger unmatched control sample which was not evaluated for periodontal disease. We conclude from these data that increased susceptibility of some patients to a very aggressive and destructive form of periodontal disease (JP) is based on defects in PMN responsiveness. Further investigations are necessary to determine whether these defects are under genetic control.",M1
3793857,"An autosomal-dominant form of juvenile periodontitis: its localization to chromosome 4 and linkage to dentinogenesis imperfecta and Gc.Study of a large five-generation kindred from southern Maryland revealed that type III dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI-III) and a localized form of juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) were both segregating as autosomal-dominant traits. Linkage analyses demonstrated that these were two distinct clinical entities, making this family the first documented instance of an autosomal-dominant form of JP. Since the locus for the more common form of dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI-II) is on chromosome 4q [Ball et al, 1982], a linkage analysis of genetic and chromosomal markers on chromosome 4 was undertaken. The results suggested that the locus for the DGI-III subtype is located a similar distance from the Gc locus (theta = 0.12) as the distance previously observed between Gc and DGI-II loci (theta = 0.11) [Ball et al, 1982; Conneally et al, 1984]. Most likely the two DGI subtypes are determined by genes at closely linked loci, by allelic genes, or by the same gene with the variable expression in different families. In addition, close linkage between the Gc locus and that determining the autosomal-dominant form of JP was observed in this family (theta = 0.05). The known map of chromosome 4q and our analysis of the markers tested suggested the gene order to be 4cen----JP----Gc----DGI----MNS----qter with a large distance (at least 15 cM) between 4cen and JP.",M1
3863910,"Clinical and laboratory studies of a family with a high prevalence of juvenile periodontitis.The form of periodontitis with onset at puberty and affecting predominantly the first molars and incisors is called juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>). The disease has been the object of intense study because from its analysis may come insights into understanding other, more common, forms of periodontitis. We recently had the opportunity to study an unusual family in which both parents developed JP in their teens. We did clinical examinations, measured leukocyte chemotaxis, analyzed the pocket microflora, looked for serum antibodies against a large panel of putative periodontal pathogens and correlated the results. The couple had two affected and two unaffected children. One of the unaffected children was not available for study. Neutrophil chemotaxis was abnormal in both parents and in the two affected children, but not in the unaffected child. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans accounted for 17.5% of the pocket flora isolated from one affected child and 2.5% of that from the unaffected child, but was not detected in the remaining family members. Antibodies specific for A. actinomycetemcomitans, Hemophilus aphrophilus and Eikenella corrodens were present in the serum of both affected children and for Capnocytophaga sputigena and C. ochracea in the father, but no antibodies directed against any of the species studied were found in the mother and the unaffected child. The distribution of disease in this family was more compatible with an X-linked dominant than with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The correlations among presence or absence of disease, abnormal neutrophil chemotaxis and presence of serum antibodies reacting with A. actinomycetemcomitans were excellent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1

No reactivity for beta 2-m was found in 71% of specimens in the P and CO groups, whereas 82% of the JP specimens showed positive beta 2-m staining in the epithelium. The reactivity was detected mostly in the upper layers of the epithelium. In all the three groups the beta 2-m reactivity was less frequent in the subepithelial connective tissue than in the epithelium proper, and it seemed to be confined to the inflammatory cells. In the JP group, prominent reactivity for beta 2-m was also located in intercellular bridges of the squamous cells. The significance of the results is discussed in terms of the cell differentiation in these diseases, including the function of beta 2-m related to the function of the classical HLA antigens (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C).",M1

3925112,"A clinical trial of phenoxymethyl penicillin for adjunctive treatment of juvenile periodontitis.A double-blind clinical trial of oral penicillin as an adjunct to conventional treatment of localized juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) was conducted. Sixteen subjects with JP were paired on the basis of general similarity of disease, and within each pair the persons were assigned randomly, one to a placebo group and one to a penicillin group. Neither patients nor therapist/examiner were aware of whether placebo or penicillin was being taken. All subjects received an initial scaling and root planing of all teeth and flap surgery of all affected sites. Every 12 weeks after surgery through Week 62 of the study, root planing and oral hygiene instructions were repeated. Phenoxymethyl penicillin (250 mg qid) or placebo was started the day of surgery and each recall visit and lasted for 10 days. Clinical measurements were made at the beginning of the study and at each recall visit. In both groups there was a significant decrease in plaque scores, gingival inflammation, gingival bleeding and probeable depths for all sites and for affected sites. Similarly there was a significant increase in attachment level and radiographic bone height, and a total elimination of suppuration. The favorable changes were apparent at the first postsurgical recall (Week 26 of the study) and remained essentially the same through Week 62. The magnitude of change in these parameters was similar to that reported by others for treatment regimes including tetracycline therapy. However, there were no differences in any parameters between the placebo and penicillin groups. Half of the subjects (4 in each group) were continued in the study for another 9 months (Week 98).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
3891961,"The cellular host response in juvenile periodontitis. A review.The current knowledge on the cellular, host-response features in juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) has been reviewed. The chemotaxis of the polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), known to be defective in JP, is modulated by serum factors and bacteria. The interactions of the putative etiologic pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) and the enzyme lysozyme with PMNs modify the host defense. Data on the phagocytic capacity of the peripheral blood and gingival crevice PMNs in JP are still controversial. The monocytes exhibit similar alterations as PMNs in interaction with A.a., but the reports on defective monocyte chemotaxis are conflicting. Both bacterial challenge and genetic factors may regulate the lymphocyte response in JP.",M1
3988337,"Serum antibody reactive with predominant organisms in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis.In the present study we sought to determine whether serum antibody was present against microorganisms which predominate in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis (SP). Subjects with SP were often seropositive for Eubacterium brachy, Fusobacterium nucleatum E3C22, and Peptostreptococcus micros, whereas subjects with juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) and subjects with healthy periodontium (HP) were not. Both SP and JP subjects were more frequently seropositive for Bacteroides gingivalis, F. nucleatum D52B16, and F. nucleatum E1D1 than were HP subjects. The data were most striking for B. gingivalis, for which both the incidence and the magnitude of specific antibody was clearly elevated for SP and JP subject groups. However, SP subjects generally had either a high antibody titer or no detectable titer. In contrast, JP and HP subjects generally had at least very small amounts of antibody. Except at very low levels of antibody, neither SP nor JP groups differed significantly from the HP group for antibody to Eubacterium nodatum, Bacteroides intermedius (homology group 4197 or 8944), or Lactobacillus minutus antibody. There was a high frequency of antibody to E. nodatum, with very high titers in all groups despite the fact that this organism is rarely found in HP subjects. For Eubacterium timidum, the JP group was clearly more frequently seropositive than the HP group. Despite high levels of L. minutus in subgingival flora, none of the 50 SP subjects had a detectable antibody titer, and only four of the HP and JP subjects had detectable antibody. These results indicate that many organisms in the subgingival flora elicit antibody responses. B. gingivalis is probably the best example among the species tested. However, some organisms that are present in high concentration, e.g., L. minutus, apparently fail to induce significant antibody responses.",M1
2986459,"Orthodontic therapy in patients with juvenile periodontitis: clinical and microbiologic effects.The correction of malocclusions in juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) patients completing periodontal therapy is a problem of increasing clinical concern to orthodontists, since many teeth with severe alveolar bone loss in these patients can now be successfully treated without extraction. In this report, fixed edgewise orthodontic therapy was carried out after the completion of periodontal therapy on four JP patients. The orthodontic therapy included extensive intrusion of teeth severely affected by JP. Phase-contrast microscopic analysis of subgingival plaque from orthodontically treated teeth was used to monitor longitudinally the effects of fixed orthodontic bands on the subgingival flora and also to monitor the efficacy of topical and systemic antimicrobial therapy aimed at suppression of suspected periodontopathic bacteria. Orthodontic movement was completed on most periodontally compromised teeth without significant evidence of additional deterioration in periodontal status. However, within the first 6 months of orthodontic band placement, all patients had significant increases in the number of spirochetes and motile rods in their subgingival flora. Three of the patients also developed high levels of crevicular polymorphonuclear leukocytes around orthodontically treated teeth, indicating significant subgingival inflammation. Intensive antimicrobial measures, including topical inorganic salt applications and systemic tetracycline, were helpful in limiting clinical inflammation and subgingival colonization by periodontopathogens during orthodontic therapy. The results demonstrate that successful orthodontic repositioning can be carried out in treated JP patients. In addition, bacteriologic monitoring and chemotherapeutic suppression of periodontal pathogens may be valuable in the prevention of further destructive periodontal disease activity in periodontitis patients undergoing orthodontic therapy.",M1
3856656,"Clinical studies of one family manifesting rapidly progressive, juvenile and prepubertal periodontitis.We report clinical, radiographic and historical data on a large family with an unusually high prevalence of periodontitis. The proband, a 20-year-old black male, had the classic features of juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>). His father was periodontally normal, while his mother had lost all her teeth at age 27 because of rapidly progressive periodontitis (RP). In addition to the 13 living children the couple had had 2 miscarriages. Of the children, one had RP, five had JP and two had prepubertal periodontitis (PP). Both maternal grandparents of the proband had become edentulous at an early age, presumably because of early-onset periodontitis. Four of 10 siblings of the proband's mother had early-onset periodontitis. In contrast, the paternal grandparents did not have early-onset periodontitis nor was periodontitis unusually prevalent in the siblings of the proband's father. The pedigree for this family is consistent with, but does not prove, an X-linked dominant pattern of genetic transmission. The natural history of early-onset periodontitis and the relationship among PP, JP and RP are not understood. The fact that the mother of the proband had RP and she had offspring with RP, JP and PP indicates a close relationship among these diseases and argues in favor of a common underlying mechanism. JP was not preceded by PP in the proband nor his affected 21-year-old brother, but one sister had PP, and at age 15 manifested JP. In her case, the alveolar bone around the deciduous molars had been destroyed, but it regenerated as the permanent premolars erupted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1

The cells were collected by the washing method. The washings were either 1) fixed for 30 min in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (GA), or 2) cytocentrifuged onto a Melinex-polyester film and fixed in GA. On the films the cells of interest were identified and light photomicrographs were taken before processing for SEM. Four types of cellular interactions were seen in SEM: between polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and epithelial cells, between PMNs and bacteria, between PMNs and between bacteria. Based on morphologic and structural interpretation, the PMNs in the local lesion in JP seemed 1) to have a different morphology from the PMNs of AP lesions, 2) to be capable of ingesting bacteria, 3) to accumulate in gingival pockets in numbers as high as in AP, and 4) to be overwhelmed by the challenge of bacteria and bacterial aggregates.",M1

A family study.The inflammatory cells in the gingival biopsy samples from a total of 9 patients with juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) and from 10 of their family members (JPrelat) belonging to 5 different families were subjected to phenotypic characterization. Plasma cells and their immunoglobulins were stained with immunoperoxidase kits for IgA, IgG, and IgM. B, T, and MPS (cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system) cells were demonstrated by the alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) technique in cryostat sections. The subsets (T helper/inducer and T suppressor/cytotoxic cells) of T cells were detected with monoclonal antibodies OKT4 and OKT8, respectively, using indirect immunofluorescence. Similar studies were completed for 19 age- and sex-matched periodontally healthy subjects. IgG plasma cells for outnumbered the IgA and IgM cells in all three series and were most pronounced in JPrelat series. Most of the inflammatory cells were ANAE-negative (B cells) in all series (78-87%). The highest proportions of T and MPS cells were found in the JP series (10% for both). A statistically significantly higher ratio for TH/Ts (OKT4+/OKT8+) was found in both the JP and JPrelat series as compared with that of the healthy controls. The findings suggest that imbalance (either inherited or acquired) in the immune regulation may play role in the development of JP.",M1

Lymphocyte blastogenesis and the autologous mixed lymphocyte response.Studies of blastogenesis of lymphocytes in culture from juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>) patients have been inconclusive. Experiments demonstrating differences in lymphocyte blastogenesis to preparations of putative periodontopathogens in JP and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were performed. Variables in the blastogenesis assay system recently reported were controlled which included using a range of cell and activator concentrations, incubation times of 3, 5 and 7 days, conical-bottomed microtest wells and chemical inhibitors during labeling of DNA which permits accurate assessment of lymphocyte blastogenesis. Using these modified culture conditions, stimulated lymphocytes of localized (LJP) and generalized (GJP) forms of JP patients did not differ significantly from stimulated lymphocytes of healthy subjects in counts incorporated, stimulation index, incubation time, cell concentration or activator dose required for maximal blastogenesis to bacterial preparations of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Y-4), Bacteroides gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochraceus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sanguis and Treponema denticola. Unstimulated lymphocyte cultures reflecting the autologous mixed lymphocyte response (AMLR) were increased for LJP compared to healthy subjects although not statistically significant.

The role of the neutrophil in the etiology and pathogenesis of LJP has recently been recognized. Experiments aimed at confirming previous information related to neutrophil chemotaxis defects in LJP were performed. Additional experiments aimed at demonstrating significant differences in phagocytosis of bacterial spores and inducing spore germination were also completed. Age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were used as  internal  controls (experiments run concomitantly). Peripheral blood neutrophils from 29 LJP, 24 GJP and 24 healthy subjects were assessed for chemotaxis. This assay was performed in a Boyden diffusion chamber using 10(-8) M N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine as chemoattractant. A chemotactic defect was defined being 2 standard deviations below the mean of healthy subjects. Twenty-three of 29 LJP (79%) and 14 of 25 GJP (58%) had a neutrophil defect. Peripheral blood neutrophil phagocytosis assays were performed in vitro using radiolabeled bacterial spores [45Ca]Bacillus cereus. Eighteen of 29 LJP (62%) and 7 of 24 GJP (29%) had a phagocytic defect. Neutrophil-induced spore germination assessed in vitro showed that 13 of 20 LJP (65%) and 3 of 8 GJP (38%) had this defect. These observations indicate that patients with JP have abnormalities in neutrophil functions of chemotaxis, phagocytosis and spore germination.",M1

The peroxidase-antiperoxidase method was used with specific antisera to alpha, gamma, and mu heavy chains and kappa and lambda light chains. The following relative distribution of plasma cells in JP/AP was found: IgA 22.7/19.5, IgG 75.6/78.5 IgM 1.7/2.0, kappa 55.5/53.5 and lambda 44.5/46.5, calculated as a % of their sum, indicating that the relative distribution of the different immunoglobulin chains was similar in both patient groups. The ratio light:heavy chains was 1.78 in JP and 1.72 in AP. The ratio kappa:lambda was 1.28 in JP and 1.17 in AP, similar to the known free kappa:free lambda chain ratio in normal serum (1.2). This indicates that the excessive staining for light chains is caused by a physiological overproduction of light chains rather than a pathological imbalance in the synthesis of immunoglobulins.",M1

Results after 5 years.The present investigation was performed to study the effect on localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) of a treatment program which included tetracycline administration, surgical elimination of inflamed tissues, scaling and root planing, and careful plaque control during healing. Treatment of LJP lesions was carried out on 16 individuals aged 14 to 18 years (<e>JP</e> group). Lesions in first molars and incisors in a group of patients with adult periodontal disease (AP) were treated in an identical manner and served as controls. The presence of angular bony defects adjacent to first molars and incisors was first documented in all patients. Thereafter, a clinical examination was carried out, including assessments of oral hygiene status, gingival conditions, probing depths and attachment levels. The patients were subjected to a treatment program involving administration of tetracycline (250 mg 4 times per day for 2 weeks), removal of granulation tissue after flap elevation, and root curettage. After surgery, the patients were instructed to rinse the mouth with 0.2% chlorhexidine for 2 min twice a day during the first 2 postsurgical weeks. Professional tooth cleaning was carried out once every 3 months during a 5-year period. At 6, 12, 24 and 60 months after surgical treatment, the patients were re-examined regarding oral hygiene, gingival conditions, probing depths and attachment levels. Treatment of LJP lesions resulted in resolution of gingival inflammation, gain of clinical attachment, and refill of bone in angular bony defects. The healing of the lesions of this patient sample was similar to healing observed in patients with AP.",M1

Maximal CL induced by latex beads with or without autologus serum did not differ between the two groups. However, bacteria with or without autologous serum seemed to induce a higher maximal CL in the JP group. The difference was statistically significant for the results obtained with opsonized bacteria. Serum opsonized bacteria induced a much higher maximal CL than the unopsonized. The opsonin dependent reaction indicates a close association with the process of phagocytosis. The increased CL of granulocytes in JP could indicate the formation of extracellularly free oxygen radicals with the potential to damage tissue. These observations support a possible involvement of the granulocytes in the pathogenesis of JP.",M1

Twenty-three age- and sex-matched patients with no periodontal disease served as the control group. Caries was evaluated by standard clinical and radiographic criteria and quantitated by decayed, missing, filled teeth and surfaces (DMFS). Decay was further categorized as active proximal decay and as total proximal decay, which included both active proximal caries and restored proximal surfaces. A Student's t test revealed no statistical differences between the LJP and GJP groups. Moreover, there was no difference in the number of missing or filled teeth in the JP group as compared to the control group. However, 17 of the 23 JP patients had no proximal decay, whereas all but two of the 23 control patients had some proximal decay. Moreover, in the JP group ( LJP and GJP ) the mean values for active proximal decay and total proximal decay were both significantly lower than those in the control group (P less than 0.001).

6584592,"Clinical, microbiological and immunological studies of a family with a high prevalence of early-onset periodontitis.Extensive clinical, laboratory and microbiological studies were performed on members of a family with an unusually high prevalence of early-onset severe periodontitis. Clinical observations included intraoral photographs and assessment of inflammation, plaque, probing depths and bone loss. Pocket bacteria were sampled, cultivated and identified. Immunological studies included assessment in vitro of neutrophil (PMN) and monocyte (MN) chemotaxis, assessment of PMN phagocytosis and other functions using the iodination assay, measurement of serum opsonic and chemoattractant activities and determination of levels of serum antibodies specific to various putative periodontal pathogens. The proband, a 19-year-old white woman, had rapidly progressive periodontitis (RP). Of her six siblings available for study, all had juvenile periodontitis (<e>JP</e>), and both parents had been edentulous since early adulthood. Early edentulism and recurrent infections, especially otitis media, were prevalent in the forebearers, especially on the maternal side. Two married sisters of the proband had young male children with recurrent infections. Abnormalities in leukocyte chemotaxis were found in the proband, in two of her siblings and in both parents. The pocket flora was predominantly Gram-negative, anaerobic rods with a high prevalence of Bacteroides species, and serum antibodies specific to Bacteroides species were detected in the sera of five of the seven patients studied. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not found in any of the pockets studied, nor were antibodies specific to any of the three known serotypes of this bacterium detected in the serum of any of the patients. There was a relatively good correlation between the bacterial species isolated from the periodontal pockets and the antibodies found in the serum. PMN iodination and serum opsonic activity were normal in all of the patients. Thus not all JP patients have detectable Actinobacillus species in their periodontal pockets, nor do all have antibody detectable with the techniques we used specific to these bacteria in their serum. In contrast, JP patients may have Bacteroides species in their periodontal pockets and antibody specific to Bacteroides species in their serum. Although abnormal leukocyte chemotaxis is generally common in RP and JP patients, in this family the correlation between this defect and the presence of these diseases was poor.",M1

Females predominated (2:1) in both JP and SP. There were significantly more subjects of the black race in JP, but when age was included as a cofactor the race distinction became insignificant. While whole mouth Plaque and Gingival Indices were lower in JP, these values at sites with attachment loss were equally high in both groups. Extent of disease was significantly related to both plaque and age in SP, and to plaque but not to age in JP. This suggests the existence of a factor(s) in JP which interfere(s) with the age-plaque-disease relationships found in SP and present in adult periodontitis. Contrary to implications of some definitions of JP, periodontal attachment loss was strongly associated with plaque and gingival inflammation in both localized and generalized patterns of disease.",M1

20219962,"Randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation to prevent seasonal influenza A in schoolchildren.BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, no rigorously designed clinical trials have evaluated the relation between vitamin D and physician-diagnosed seasonal influenza. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of vitamin D supplements on the incidence of seasonal influenza A in schoolchildren. DESIGN: From December 2008 through March 2009, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing vitamin D(3) supplements (1200 IU/d) with placebo in schoolchildren. The primary outcome was the incidence of influenza A, diagnosed with influenza antigen testing with a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. RESULTS: Influenza A occurred in 18 of 167 (10.8%) children in the vitamin D(3) group compared with 31 of 167 (18.6%) children in the placebo group [relative risk (RR), 0.58; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.99; P = 0.04]. The reduction in influenza A was more prominent in children who had not been taking other vitamin D supplements (RR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.79; P = 0.006) and who started nursery school after age 3 y (RR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.78; P = 0.005).

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate safety and efficacy of inhaled GM-CSF in patients with unremitting or progressive PAP. METHODS: We conducted a national, multicenter, self-controlled, phase II trial at nine pulmonary centers throughout Japan. Patients who had lung biopsy or cytology findings diagnostic of PAP, an elevated serum GM-CSF antibody level, and a Pa(O(2)) of less than 75 mm Hg entered a 12-week observation period. Those who improved (i.e., alveolar-arterial oxygen difference [A-aDO(2)] decreased by 10 mm Hg) during observation were excluded. The rest entered sequential periods of high-dose therapy (250 microg Days 1-8, none Days 9-14; x six cycles; 12 wk); low-dose therapy (125 microg Days 1-4, none Days 5-14; x six cycles; 12 wk), and follow-up (52 wk). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty patients with PAP were enrolled in the study. During observation, nine improved and two withdrew; all of these were excluded. Of 35 patients completing the high- and low-dose therapy, 24 improved, resulting in an overall response rate of 62% (24/39; intention-to-treat analysis) and reduction in A-aDO(2) of 12.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 8.4-16.2; n = 35, P &lt; 0.001). No serious adverse events occurred, and serum GM-CSF autoantibody levels were unchanged. A treatment-emergent correlation occurred between A-aDO(2) and diffusing capacity of the lung, and high-resolution CT revealed improvement of ground-glass opacity. Twenty-nine of 35 patients remained stable without further therapy for 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled GM-CSF therapy is safe, effective, and provides a sustained therapeutic effect in autoimmune PAP.

In the present paper, we show that capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful tool for the analysis of OSCS and DS in heparin preparations. CE method shows high resolution and good quantification of OSCS in heparin preparations. This method (OSCS method) was evaluated for accuracy (93.7 %), repeatability (R.S.D.=2.11), linearity (R(2)=0.9996), detection limit (0.1% OSCS) and specificity. In contrast, DS was not able to be detected in high sensitivity by OSCS method. However, a modified CE method (DS method) using the buffer at lower pHs showed good parameters for accuracy (88.1%), repeatability (R.S.D.=1.99), linearity (R(2)=0.9998), detection limit (0.25% DS) and specificity. In conclusion, CE will be an alternative to the NMR method which is being adopted for purification test of heparin sodium in the present version of JP.",M2
19652475,"Serological studies of infectious bronchitis vaccines against Japanese field isolates of homologous and heterologous genotypes.The genetic diversity of the partial S1 gene involving the hyper variable region for infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccine strains in Japan were compared with those of IB virus isolated from the field in Japan. Field isolates have mainly been classified into three major genotypes, <e>JP</e>-I, JP-II and JP-III, since 2003; however, the 4/91 genotype was detected from recent field isolates in Japan. The virus neutralization (VN) activity with vaccine immunized serum was investigated to evaluate the protective effects of vaccines against Japanese field isolates. In the results of the VN test, antiserum immunized with the GN and C78 (JP-I), TM-86w and Miyazaki (JP-II) and 4/91 (793B) vaccine strains could neutralize a high rate of field isolates of homologous genotype (75% of field isolates of JP-I, 100% of that of JP-II and 100% of that of 793B, respectively). For field isolates of JP-III, even though there are no homologous genotype vaccine strain, some strains of JP-III were neutralized with immune serum from vaccine strains of the heterologous genotype. In this study, a correlation between serological property and genotype was found for JP-I, JP-II and 793B. Our results suggested that an effective vaccine could be predicted in accordance with the genotype of field isolates.",M2
19498283,"Genetic analysis of the S1 gene of 4/91 type infectious bronchitis virus isolated in Japan.S1 gene sequences for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains of the 4/91 genotype (commonly called 793B) isolated from field outbreaks in Japan were analyzed to ascertain the relationship to 4/91 vaccine strain. Three field isolates (<e>JP</e>/Wakayama/2003, JP/Iwate/2005 and JP/Saitama/2006) from flocks not immunized with a 4/91 type live IBV vaccine and one isolate (JP/Wakayama-2/2004) from a flock immunized with a 4/91 type live vaccine were examined. The amino acid identities among JP/Wakayama/2003, JP/Iwate/2005 and JP/Saitama/2006 were about 98%, whereas the identities to the 4/91 vaccine strain and JP/Wakayama-2/2004 were about 90%. Three of the field isolates, JP/Wakayama/2003, JP/Iwate/2005 and JP/Saitama/2006, were classified into a cluster closely related to French and Spanish isolates, but different from the cluster including the vaccine and JP/Wakayama-2/2004. These results indicate that JP/Wakayama/2003, JP/Iwate/2005 and JP/Saitama/2006 were derived from foreign field isolates, but not from the vaccine strain. On the other hand, the S1 gene of JP/Wakayama-2/2004 revealed high sequence similarity with that of the 4/91 vaccine strain and appeared to be a vaccine-like virus derived from a vaccine. The field isolates of 4/91 genotype IBV could be distinguished from other genotypes by using the BalI and Pst I enzymes in addition to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods of Mase et al. [16] using Hae II and EcoR I enzymes. Furthermore, the 4/91 vaccine strain and vaccine-like isolate (JP/Wakayama-2/2004) could be differentiated from the other field isolates by Bgl II digestion. This method, therefore, would assist in identification of field isolates of the 4/91 genotype as outbreaks of IBV in vaccinated flocks.",M2

The English translation has been completed (http://www.jsh.or.<e>jp</e>), and its summary has just been published (Hepatol Res 38:37-51, 2008). This set of guidelines covers six research fields: prevention, diagnosis and surveillance, surgery, chemotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization, and percutaneous local ablation therapy. For the users' convenience, practical algorithms for the surveillance and treatment of HCC were also created, which are based on evidence from articles selected for the guidelines and modified according to the current status of medical practice in Japan. One year after their publication, the J-HCC Guidelines have become well disseminated among both specialists and primary care physicians in Japan. As expected, these guidelines have begun to be applied at every level of clinical decision making for HCC. The first revision of the J-HCC Guidelines is now in process, and it is scheduled to be completed by March 2009.",M2
19166052,"Isolation of 4/91 type of infectious bronchitis virus as a new variant in Japan and efficacy of vaccination against 4/91 type field isolate.Among field isolates of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) from recent outbreaks, some isolates that were classified into the 4/91 genotype, by analysis of the S1 gene, have been confirmed to be a new variant in Japan. To elucidate the characteristics of these isolates, pathogenicity in chicks and the efficacy of vaccines against this new variant were examined. Severe respiratory symptoms were observed in 4-day-old specific pathogen free chicks inoculated with a 4/91 genotype isolate, either <e>JP</e>/Wakayama/2003 or JP/ Iwate/2005; body weights 3 wk after inoculation were significantly lower than those of chicks inoculated with a 4/91 vaccine strain. These 4/91 isolates were neutralized with serum from birds immunized with 4/91 vaccine. In a challenge-protection test, five groups of chicks were immunized with C78, TM-86w, H120, Kita-1, or 4/91 vaccines and then challenged with JP/Iwate/2005 4 wk after vaccination. A protective effect in the 4/91 and TM-86w vaccine groups was indicated by evaluation of the ciliostasis score of the trachea, the respiratory symptom score, and virus isolation from trachea swab samples after challenge. The results of this study suggested that the 4/91 type of IBV, which is virulent to chicks when compared to vaccine strains, has emerged as a new variant in Japan, and vaccines containing the 4/91 strain or the TM-86w strain could be effective for this variant.",M2

Thirty primer-probe sets for the specific detection of GM lines, recombinant DNA (r-DNA) segments, endogenous reference genes, and donor organisms were synthesized, and a 96-well PCR plate was prepared with a different primer-probe in each well as the real-time PCR array. The specificity and sensitivity of the array were evaluated. A comparative analysis with the data and publicly available information on GM crops approved in Japan allowed us to assume the possibility of unapproved GM crop contamination. Furthermore, we designed a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application, Unapproved GMO Checker version 2.01, which helps process all the data of real-time PCR arrays for the easy assumption of unapproved GM crop contamination.

18402595,"Epidemiological characteristics of tsutsugamushi disease in Oita Prefecture, Japan: yearly and monthly occurrences of its infections and serotypes of its causative agent, Orientia tsutsugamushi, during 1984--2005.Using indirect immunofluorescence assay, we examined the sera of 561 patients from November 1984 to February 2005 to determine the incidence of tsutsugamushi disease (scrub typhus) in Oita Prefecture, Japan. The results obtained were positive in 384 individuals (68.4%). Municipalities where patients were presumed to have been infected with Orientia tsutsugamushi were Taketa City (41.7%), Oyama Town (13.5%), and Ogi Town (8.3%). Infections occurred most often in October, November, and December. A small number of cases occurred from January to May. The serotypes Kuroki (47.5%), Kawasaki (42.5%), and Karp (10.0%) were detected by genetic analysis of O. tsutsugamushi DNA extracted from the blood of 120 patients. The gene sequences of the Kuroki type were highly homologous to that of the Nishino strain. The gene sequences of the Kawasaki type were identical to that of the Kawasaki strain. The gene sequence of the Karp type was highly homologous to that of the <e>JP</e>-2 type. To determine the distribution of vector mites, 558 wild rodents were captured and 72010 mites attached to these rodents were collected from 1982 to 1998. Six genera and 16 species of trombiculid mites were collected. Leptotrombidium pallidum and L. scutellare, which are known to be mite vectors for tsutsugamushi disease, accounted for 20.5% and 5.9%, respectively, of all trombiculid mites collected. The geographical distribution of cases roughly coincided with the distribution of L. scutellare. In Oita Prefecture, L. scutellare is presumed to primarily transmit tsutsugamushi disease. In addition, our results also suggest that L. pallidum transmits the Karp type of the causative rickettsia in some municipalities.",M2

With the aim of ensuring the quality and presenting the basic concepts of prosthodontic therapy, the Japan Prosthodontic Society, which bears a great obligation and responsibility toward society and the Japanese public, has decided to undertake the formulation of guidelines related to prosthodontic therapy, and decided to first undertake the formulation of  Practice guideline for denture relining and rebasing , and to prepare a guideline model. We tried to prepare the guidelines according to the  Procedure for preparing practice guidelines , but because of the scientific uniqueness of prosthodontic treatment and dentistry, research to elucidate the basis of treatment has been insufficient, and we ultimately reconfirmed the current state of affairs in which it is difficult to perform. We therefore prepared the guidelines based on the limited evidence obtained in a search of the scientific literature and on the consensus of experts. The Japan Prosthodontic Society has investigated and prepared a Society guideline  model  to the extent possible at the present time, and it has prepared  Guidelines for adhesion bridge  and  Practice guidelines for denture prosthodontics  based on it.

17972358,"Effects of socioeconomic factors and cancer survivors' worries on their quality of life (QOL) in Japan.Effects of socioeconomic factors and cancer survivors' worries on their quality of life (QOL) were investigated. In 2002, Japanese national survey was performed to assess distress among cancer patients using a semi-structured questionnaire (http://www.scchr.<e>jp</e>/yorozu/pdf/taiken_koe_eng.pdf). We investigated relationships between patients' distress and their QOL measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy--12-item Spiritual Well-Being Scale (FACIT-Sp), using a covariance structure analysis and multivariate regression analysis. A total of 130 outpatients (male: 42%; average age: 59 years; performance status rating 0-2:89%; breast/lung/gastrointestinal cancer: 38/22/21%) answered the questionnaires. A covariance structure analysis extracted latent variables, which were named socioeconomic distress and cancer worries, using a model that sufficiently represented the observed data (Goodness of fit index = 0.833). Regression analysis demonstrated that higher family income significantly correlated with better Global health status/QOL (p = 0.003) but that losing a job negatively correlated with all of the scales on functioning in the QLQ-C30 (p &lt; 0.05) and spiritual well-being (p &lt; 0.05). Patients' QOL was also affected by physical worries and spiritual issues in terms of emotional, cognitive, and social functioning. In conclusion, cancer survivors' QOL was doubly affected by socioeconomic distress and cancer worries. In the former, lower family income and losing employment by experiencing cancer had a negative impact on patients' QOL. As to the latter, physical worries and spiritual issues also affected patients' QOL.",M2
17954218,"Basic analytical systems for lipidomics by mass spectrometry in Japan.In recent analyses of phospholipids, the application of mass spectrometry (MS) has become increasingly popular. To elucidate the function of phospholipids, it is necessary to analyze not only their classes and subclasses, but also their molecular species. In choosing analytical methods for lipidomics, we selected several different approaches in the identification of phospholipid molecular species. The first approach, global and shotgun liquid chromatographic tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) analysis, uses data-dependent MS/MS scanning, whereas the second approach is structure related, focusing on methods using precursor ion scanning or neutral loss scanning. The third approach uses theoretically expanded multiple reaction monitoring for the analysis of targeted molecules in extremely small amounts. Data from the first and second types of analyses can be obtained with the use of our search engine, Lipid Search (http://lipidsearch.<e>jp</e>), and most probable molecular species can be obtained with their compensated ion intensities. Identified individual molecular species can be automatically profiled according to their compensated ion intensities. Profiled data can be visualized in the state of relative increase or decrease. These data are available via the Lipid Bank (http://lipidbank.jp) and the MassBank (http://www.massbank.jp).",M2

It is, however, often used mistakenly for lot quality assurance. In comparison to the Japan Phamacopeia (<e>JP</e>) procedure, USP procedure is less discriminative between lots with on-target mean and small variance and lots with off-target mean and large variance. The new European Pharmacopeia (EP) and USP harmonized test adopted a tolerance interval approach. But the  no-difference zone  criteria modification for off-target products make the approaches biased in favor of off-target products. We propose a parametric tolerance interval procedure to test a two-sided specification that is equivalent to the test of two one-sided hypotheses. Testing against a lower specification is to assure that the drug product is not under-dosed for the sake of efficacy. On the other hand, testing against an upper specification is to assure that the drug product is not over-dosed for the sake of safety. The operating curves of the proposed procedure are compared with those of the USP test to illustrate the difference in acceptance probability against the mean and variance of the lot.",M2
17140251,"A provisional biopharmaceutical classification of the top 200 oral drug products in the United States, Great Britain, Spain, and Japan.Orally administered, immediate-release (IR) drug products in the top 200 drug product lists from the United States (US), Great Britain (GB), Spain (ES), and Japan (<e>JP</e>) were provisionally classified based on the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). The provisional classification is based on the aqueous solubility of the drugs reported in readily available reference literature and a correlation of human intestinal membrane permeability for a set of 29 reference drugs with their calculated partition coefficients. Oral IR drug products constituted more that 50% of the top 200 drug products on all four lists, and ranged from 102 to 113 in number. Drugs with dose numbers less than or equal to unity are defined as high-solubility drugs. More than 50% of the oral IR drug products on each list were determined to be high-solubility drugs (55-59%). The provisional classification of permeability is based on correlations of the human intestinal permeabilities of 29 reference drugs with the calculated Log P or CLogP lipophilicity values for the uncharged chemical form. The Log P and CLogP estimates were linearly correlated (r2 = 0.79) for 187 drugs. Metoprolol was chosen as the reference compound for permeability and Log P or CLogP. A total of 62-69.0% and 56-60% of the drugs on the four lists exhibited CLogP and Log P estimates, respectively, greater than or equal to the corresponding metoprolol value and are provisionally classified as high-permeability drugs. We have compared the BCS classification in this study with the recently proposed BDDCS classification based on fraction dose metabolism. Although the two approaches are based on different in vivo processes, fraction dose metabolized and fraction dose absorbed are highly correlated and, while depending on the choice of reference drug for permeability classification, e.g., metoprolol vs cimetidine or atenolol, show excellent agreement in drug classification. In summary, more than 55% of the drug products were classified as high-solubility (Class 1 and Class 3) drugs in the four lists, suggesting that in vivo bioequivalence (BE) may be assured with a less expensive and more easily implemented in vitro dissolution test.",M2

This finding was subjected to cross-validation in this study with Japanese (<e>JP</e>) and German Caucasian (GE) subjects. METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms discovery and genotyping were carried out through resequencing of a 1839 base pair (bp) region in GABRB2. Tagging SNPs (tSNPs) were selected based on linkage disequilibrium (LD), combinations of which were analyzed with Bonferroni correction and permutation for disease association. Random resampling was applied to generate size- and gender-balanced cases and control subjects. RESULTS: Out of the 17 SNPs (9.2/kilobase [kb]) revealed, 6 were population-specific. Population variations in LD were observable, and at least two low LD points were identified in both populations. Although disease association at single SNP level was only shown in GE, strong association was demonstrated in both JP (p = .0002 - .0191) and GE (p = .0033 - .0410) subjects, centering on haplotypes containing rs1816072 and rs1816071. Among different clinical subtypes, the most significant association was exhibited by systematic schizophrenia.

This allowed us to perform a phylogenetic analysis with a pool of 942 Asiatic sequences. New clades and subclades emerged from the Japanese data. On the basis of this unequivocal phylogeny, we classified 4713 Asian partial mitochondrial sequences, with &lt;10% ambiguity. Applying population and phylogeographic methods, we used these sequences to shed light on the controversial issue of the peopling of Japan. Population-based comparisons confirmed that present-day Japanese have their closest genetic affinity to northern Asian populations, especially to Koreans, which finding is congruent with the proposed Continental gene flow to Japan after the Yayoi period. This phylogeographic approach unraveled a high degree of differentiation in Paleolithic Japanese. Ancient southern and northern migrations were detected based on the existence of basic M and N lineages in Ryukyuans and Ainu. Direct connections with Tibet, parallel to those found for the Y-chromosome, were also apparent. Furthermore, the highest diversity found in Japan for some derived clades suggests that Japan could be included in an area of migratory expansion to Continental Asia.

Preoperative histologic diagnosis and diagnostic imaging are fundamentals in managing the disease, but it is not rare to find unexpected peritoneal dissemination or liver metastasis at the time of operation. The overall resectability rate of pancreatic cancer is 40% in Japan. Resecting the portal vein and peripancreatic plexus were performed on 40% of the patients who underwent pancreatectomy for invasive cancer in the head of the pancreas. Long-term survival was only found in patients who underwent pancreatectomy. Radical lymph node dissection, or combined resection of the large vessels, did not seem to improve survival further than the standard resection. Multidisciplinary treatments combined with surgery were performed, and various effects of postoperative chemotherapy after pancreatectomy, intraoperative- and postoperative-radiation therapy, or postoperative chemotherapy for unresectable tumor, were shown. Development of unconventional therapies and refinement of the conventional therapy should be promoted on a randomized prospective trial basis.

Each student was allotted a personal computer that was connected to the internet, and was informed of the URL (www.pharmasys.gr.<e>jp</e>/homepage.html) where they were able to search for pertinent essential information on drugs and to report adverse events to the official concerned organization. There were three students to a group, each of which was provided with a judicial precedent. Each judicial case record was deliberately truncated after the section where the physician committed misuse of drugs, so that the students had freedom to imagine the rest of the story. Each group was asked to summarize the case, to speculate on the prognosis and to point out the inappropriate use of drugs. Most groups predicted the outcome optimistically at first, but as they scrutinized the cases, they became aware of serious mistakes that the physicians had committed in patient care. The results suggest that the internet is a powerful tool for gleaning drug information and reporting adverse effects.

Generally, this test is intended to determine the content of inorganic substances contained as impurities in an organic substance, and, occasionally, to determine the amount of inorganic substances contained as components in an organic substance. Our laboratories have adopted this test method for the above two purposes in the case of the quality control for drug substances, synthetic intermediates, starting materials in the course of drug development. Some validation studies have been conducted for this test in order to clarify the quantitation limit in the case of an application for the former purpose, and trueness and precision in the case of the latter purpose. Consequently, the quantitation limit was determined as around 0.50 mg. The amount of sample should be determined based on this quantitation limit (mg) and the level of quantitation limit (%) or that of specification limit (%) should be considered from the view point of each testing purpose. The test method was also confirmed to have a good trueness and precision as the determination method for an alkaline salt, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salt, of organic compounds, as long as the test is operated with great care not to scatter the content out of crucible during ignition to incineration.",M2

METHODS: Biopsy specimens of the prostate were obtained from 15 men of each racial group with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 4.1-10.0 ng/mL. The stained cores were quantitatively analyzed for the percentage of the area with different cellular composition (stroma (S), epithelium (E), epithelial lumen (L), and glandular component (E + L = G)), using computer-assisted color imaging. RESULTS: The mean percent area density of S, E, and L in the prostate of CA men was 84.2, 12.1, and 3.8%, respectively; for AA, 84.4, 12.4, and 3.2%; for JP, 77.4, 15.2, and 7.5%. The S/E ratio is significantly lower in JP than in CA men. The S/G ratio is significantly lower in JP than in CA and AA men. Overall, JP contained more glandular lumen and less stromal component than that of CA and AA. CA and AA showed no significant difference in cellular composition. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the differences in cellular composition of BPH among the three races. This cellular composition divergence may account for previously observed racial differences in PSA, PSA density, and the incidence of clinical BPH.",M2

The nucleotide sequences of different strains showed great diversity, with a range of 57 to 100% identities among strains. The strains could be classified into five clusters: Norwalk (NV), Snow Mountain agent/Bristol virus (SMA/BV), Toronto virus/Mexico virus (TV/MX), and Japan specific cluster 1 and 2 (<e>JP</e>-1 and JP-2). Within each cluster there is greater than 85% identity of amino acid sequence (more than 75% identity of nucleotide sequences), based on sequence homology analysis. We believe that two of the five clusters, JP-1and JP-2, define new specific clusters found in Japan according to phylogenetic and pair-wise comparison studies. An RT-PCR procedure was designed using new consensus primer pairs, P1/P2, P1/P3, and Y1/Y2 based on multiple alignment of collected nucleotide sequences, that are expected to detect nearly all NLVs prevailing in Japan. The usefulness of the primers was tested by ten different laboratories in Japan using a panel of ten fecal samples containing different virus strains.

At the three hospitals examined, a single PCR ribotype strain (type smz) was predominant and accounted for 22 (65%) of 34, 18 (64%) of 28, and 11 (44%) of 25 isolates, respectively. All of the 51 isolates that represented PCR ribotype smz were nontypeable by PFGE because of DNA degradation. Since the type smz strain did not react with any of the antisera against 10 different serogroups (A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, and X), we prepared a new antiserum against a type smz isolate. All 51 type smz isolates presented identical banding patterns, reacting with the newly prepared antiserum (designated subserogroup <e>JP</e>-0 of serogroup JP). These results were compared with those of a strain from a hospital outbreak that occurred in New York, which has been identified as type J9 by restriction enzyme analysis and type 01/A by arbitrarily primed PCR but was nontypeable by PFGE because of DNA degradation. This strain was reported to be epidemic at multiple hospitals in the United States. The J9 strain represented a PCR ribotype pattern different from that of a type smz strain and was typed as subserogroup G-1 of serogroup G by immunoblot analysis. A single outbreak type causing nosocomial CDAD in Japan was found to be different from the strain causing multiple outbreaks in the United States, even though the outbreak strains from the two countries were nontypeable by PFGE because of DNA degradation.",M2

Recently, we mapped the gene locus for AR-JP to chromosome 6q25.2-q27 by linkage analysis and we identified a novel large gene, Parkin, consisting of 12 exons from this region; mutations of this gene were found to be the cause of AR-JP in two families. Now we report results of extensive molecular analysis on 34 affected individuals from 18 unrelated families with AR-JP. We found four different homozygous intragenic deletional mutations, involving exons 3 to 4, exon 3, exon 4, and exon 5 in 10 families (17 affected individuals). In addition to the exonic deletions, we identified a novel one-base deletion involving exon 5 in two families (2 affected individuals).

The major component of KEGG is the PATHWAY database that consists of graphical diagrams of biochemical pathways including most of the known metabolic pathways and some of the known regulatory pathways. The pathway information is also represented by the ortholog group tables summarizing orthologous and paralogous gene groups among different organisms. KEGG maintains the GENES database for the gene catalogs of all organisms with complete genomes and selected organisms with partial genomes, which are continuously re-annotated, as well as the LIGAND database for chemical compounds and enzymes. Each gene catalog is associated with the graphical genome map for chromosomal locations that is represented by Java applet. In addition to the data collection efforts, KEGG develops and provides various computational tools, such as for reconstructing biochemical pathways from the complete genome sequence and for predicting gene regulatory networks from the gene expression profiles. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.<e>jp</e>/kegg/).",M2

Comparisons of the data for each marker in the Japanese population sample with data for the same markers among Caucasian samples in the Genome Database (GDB) revealed a slightly lower average of heterozygosity in Japanese (71% vs 79%). Although the majority of the markers were as informative as in Caucasians, some in our sample were uninformative due to low heterozygosity; 38 loci revealed heterozygosities lower than 50% and 11 of these were less than 30%. Furthermore, allelic distributions at many of the marker loci were quite different in the two racial groups. Since such differences will influence statistical analyses between markers and disease loci, our data will be essential for linkage analyses, sib-ship pair analyses, and association studies involving the Japanese population.

RESULTS: The new schema and systems were created using an object-oriented design approach. The design was accomplished in accordance with ANSI/SPARC three-level schema architecture. First, the conceptual schema was designed using a functional model named AIS (associative information structure) and was visualized in extended diagram format. The model is a natural extension of an ER (entity relationship) model and describes real-world objects in binary associations between entities with the concept of order. Second, the schema was mapped on a relational database as a physical schema. All details are concentrated in this schema and the layer lying above enjoys physical independence. Finally, as another layer, external modeling was introduced for the database applications interface. It provides set-at-a-time basis operations and was implemented as a C++ object-oriented library. On this common framework of a new schema, a new annotator's workbench named Yamato II and a World Wide Web (WWW) submission system named Sakura have been successfully developed to improve drastically daily transactions in the DDBJ.

It may be conducted by the gel-clot or spectrophotometric (turbidimetric and colorimetric) techniques, the former being based on gel formation due to the activation of LAL by endotoxins. The turbidimetric technique is based on the LAL turbidity change during the gel formation and the colorimetric technique on activation of peptide hydrolytic enzymes in LAL. The Limulus test has been unofficially utilized as a simple and highly sensitive method for the determination of endotoxins in parenteral drugs in lieu of the in vivo Pyrogen Test using rabbits. For the Bacterial Endotoxins Test of the JP XII, the gel-clot technique alone was adopted, the technique being only allowed for Injection. Although most parenteral drugs show inhibition or enhancement in practice, this test can be most easily conducted by eliminating interfering effects through dilution of specimens by a factor not exceeding the maximum valid dilution (MVD) with water.
