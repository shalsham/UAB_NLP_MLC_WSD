20496784,"[Gender characteristics of the external <e>respiration</e> violations in patients inflammatory bowel disease]Article presents results of the study pulmonary function tests in 88 patients (mean age 40.6 yr) with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): 19 with Crohn's disease and 69 with ulcerative colitis, 44 women and 44 men, 40 smokers and 48 nonsmokers. A pulmonary function abnormality was present in 43 (48.9%) of the 88 patients. Pulmonary function abnormalities was present of small airway disease. The prevalence of pulmonary function abnormalities was significantly higher among womens than among mens: prevalence ratio was 1.5 (p &lt; 0.05). Smoking is increased risk of pulmonary function abnormalities in patients with UC.",M1

There were delineated the main trends of investigation of the pulmonary ventilation capacity in patients with tracheobronchial obstruction, caused by MT. The concept of optimal estimation of ERF in such patients was formulated. The ERF indices estimation permits to determine the ways of operation security enhancement as well as prognosis conduction and prophylaxis of intra- and postoperative complications occurrence.",M1
20412482,"A new multiparameter approach to computational simulation for Fontan assessment and redesign.INTRODUCTION: Despite an abundance of prior Fontan simulation articles, there have been relatively few clinical advances that are a direct result of computational methods. We address a few key limitations of previous Fontan simulations as a step towards increasing clinical relevance. Previous simulations have been limited in scope because they have primarily focused on a single energy loss parameter. We present a multi-parameter approach to Fontan modeling that establishes a platform for clinical decision making and comprehensive evaluation of proposed interventions. METHODS: Time-dependent, 3-D blood flow simulations were performed on six patient-specific Fontan models. Key modeling advances include detailed pulmonary anatomy, catheterization-derived pressures, and MRI-derived flow with <e>respiration</e>. The following performance parameters were used to rank patients at rest and simulated exercise from best to worst performing: energy efficiency, inferior and superior vena cava (IVC, SVC) pressures, wall shear stress, and IVC flow distribution. RESULTS: Simulated pressures were well matched to catheterization data, but low Fontan pressure did not correlate with high efficiency. Efficiency varied from 74% to 96% at rest, and from 63% to 91% with exercise. Distribution of IVC flow ranged from 88%/12% (LPA/RPA) to 53%/47%. A  transcatheter  virtual intervention demonstrates the utility of computation in evaluating interventional strategies, and is shown to result in increased energy efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: A multiparameter approach demonstrates that each parameter results in a different ranking of Fontan performance. Ranking patients using energy efficiency does not correlate with the ranking using other parameters of presumed clinical importance. As such, current simulation methods that evaluate energy dissipation alone are not sufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of new Fontan designs.",M1
20400631,"Effect of acute exposure to low environmental calcium on <e>respiration</e> and locomotion in Lymnaea stagnalis (L.).Environmental calcium is a major factor affecting the distribution of freshwater gastropods. Whilst the effects on growth and morphology are fairly well understood, little is known about how calcium availability affects other aspects of gastropod biology. Lymnaea stagnalis (L.) is considered a calciphile and exhibits reduced growth and survival in environments containing less than 20 mg l(-1) Ca(2+). Many freshwater systems exhibit fluctuations in calcium concentration over time: where calcium levels are normally high there may be periods of low [Ca(2+)], for example following periods of flooding. Here we examined the effects of acute periods of low (20 mg l(-1)) environmental calcium on the physiology and behaviour of L. stagnalis, specifically measuring how locomotion and respiration differ between high calcium (80 mg l(-1)) and low calcium (20 mg l(-1)) environments. We found that in a low calcium environment crawling speed is reduced, and that this coincides with an increase in cutaneous respiration, indicating that the increased metabolic demands of calcium acquisition at low [Ca(2+)] reduce the energy available for locomotion. Conversely we found a decrease in aerial respiration in hypoxic conditions in the low calcium relative to the high calcium environment. In conclusion, we found that acute exposure to low environmental calcium has a highly significant effect on locomotion and respiration, which may have consequences for snail fitness when no morphological effects are apparent.",M1
20360132,"Genesis of multipeaked waves of the esophagus: repetitive contractions or motion artifact?Multipeaked waves (MPW) in the distal esophagus occur frequently in patients with esophageal spastic motor disorders and diabetes mellitus and are thought to represent repetitive esophageal contractions. We aimed to investigate whether the relative motion between a stationary pressure sensor and contracted peristaltic esophageal segment that moves with <e>respiration</e> leads to the formation of MPW. We mathematically modeled the effect of relative movement between a moving pressure segment and a fixed pressure sensor on the pressure waveform morphology. We conducted retrospective analysis of 100 swallow-induced esophageal contractions in 10 patients, who demonstrated &gt;30% MPW on high-resolution manometry (HRM) during standardized swallows. Finally, using HRM, we determined the effects of suspended breathing and hyperventilation on the waveform morphology in 10 patients prospectively. Modeling revealed that relative movement between a stationary pressure sensor and a moving contracted segment, contraction duration, contraction amplitude, respiratory frequency, and depth of respiration affects the waveform morphology. Retrospective analysis demonstrated a close temporal association with the onset of second and subsequent contractions in MPW with respiratory phase reversals. Numbers of peaks in MPW and respiratory phase reversals were closely related to the duration of contraction. In the prospective study, suspended breathing and hyperventilation resulted in a significant decrease and increase in the MPW frequency as well as the number of peaks within MPW respectively. We conclude that MPW observed during clinical motility studies are not indicative of repetitive esophageal contraction; rather they represent respiration-related movement of the contracted esophageal segment in relation to the stationary pressure sensor.",M1
20355325,"Difference of physiological characters in dark green islands and yellow leaf tissue of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected Nicotiana tabacum leaves.Dark green islands (DGIs) are a common symptom of plants systemically infected with the mosaic virus. DGIs are clusters of green leaf cells that are free of virus but surrounded by yellow leaf tissue that is full of virus particles. In Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected Nicotiana tabacum leaves, the <e>respiration</e> and photosynthesis capabilities of DGIs and yellow leaf tissues were measured. The results showed that the cyanide-resistant respiration was enhanced in yellow leaf tissue and the photosynthesis was declined, while in DGIs they were less affected. The activities of the oxygen-scavenging enzymes catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in infected leaves were significantly higher than those in the healthy leaves, and the enzyme activities in DGIs were always lower than in the yellow leaf tissues. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) staining showed that the hydrogen peroxide content in yellow leaf tissues was apparently higher than that in DGIs, while the superoxide content was on the contrary. Formation of DGIs may be a strategy of the host plants resistance to the CMV infection.",M1
20348606,"Investigation into the feasibility of using PRESAGE/optical-CT dosimetry for the verification of gating treatments.This work presents an investigation into the use of PRESAGE dosimeters with an optical-CT scanner as a 3D dosimetry system for quantitative verification of respiratory-gated treatments. The CIRS dynamic thorax phantom was modified to incorporate a moving PRESAGE dosimeter-simulating <e>respiration</e> motion in the lungs. A simple AP/PA lung treatment plan was delivered three times to the phantom containing a different but geometrically identical PRESAGE insert each time. Each delivery represented a treatment scenario: static, motion (free-breathing) and gated. The dose distributions, in the three dosimeters, were digitized by the optical-CT scanner. Improved optical-CT readout yielded an increased signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 3 and decreased reconstruction artifacts compared with prior work. Independent measurements of dose distributions were obtained in the central plane using EBT film. Dose distributions were normalized to a point corresponding to the 100% isodose region prior to the measurement of dose profiles and gamma maps. These measurements were used to quantify the agreement between measured and ECLIPSE(R) dose distributions. Average gamma pass rates between PRESAGE and EBT were &gt;99% (criteria 3% dose difference and 1.2 mm distance-to-agreement) for all three treatments. Gamma pass rates between PRESAGE and ECLIPSE(R) 3D dose distributions showed excellent agreement for the gated treatment (100% pass rate), but poor for the motion scenario (85% pass rate). This work demonstrates the feasibility of using PRESAGE/optical-CT 3D dosimetry to verify gating-enabled radiation treatments. The capability of the Varian gating system to compensate for motion in this treatment scenario was demonstrated.",M1
20304781,"Ectomycorrhizal identity determines <e>respiration</e> and concentrations of nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrates in root tips: a test using Pinus sylvestris and Quercus robur saplings.Fine roots play a significant role in plant and ecosystem respiration (RS); therefore, understanding factors controlling that process is important both to advancing understanding and potentially in modelling carbon (C) budgets. However, very little is known about the extent to which ectomycorrhizal (ECM) identity may influence RS or the underlying chemistry that may determine those rates. In order to test these relationships, we examined RS, measured as O(2) consumption, of first-order ECM root tips of Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus robur L. saplings in relation to their ECM fungal symbionts and associated nitrogen (N), C and non-structural carbohydrate concentrations. Roots of P. sylvestris were colonized by Rhizopogon roseolus, Tuber sp. 1 and an unknown species of Pezizales. Fungal species colonizing Q. robur roots were Hebeloma sp., Tuber sp. 2 and one unidentified ECM fungus described as Tuber-like based on ECM morphology. ECM RS rates for different host species were significantly different and more than 97% of the variation in RS within a host species was explained by ECM root tip N concentrations. This may indicate that some of the variability in fine root RS-N relationships observed between and within different host species or their functional groups may be related to intraspecific host species differences in root tip N concentration among ECM fungal associates.",M1
20235431,"[Starvation and chemoreception in Antarctic benthic invertebrates]Sensitivity (chemoreception) to different amino acids was studied in six invertebrate species: Serolis polita, Glyptonotus antarcticus, Abyssochromene plebs, Waldeckia obesa, Odontaster validus, and Sterechinus neumayeri. The sensitivity was estimated by the changes in basic metabolism (<e>respiration</e> rate). Starvation increased the sensitivity in all the species. The metabolism rates increased in the presence of L-glutamic acid in G. antarcticus, A. plebs, O. validus, and S. neumayeri. The serine and arginine amino acids had a significant impact on the metabolism of the necrophagous species S. polita and W. obesa. The chemical information may be mediated by means of L-glutamic acid via glutamate receptors, which can be blocked by kynurenic acid, as occurs in the experiments with G. antarcticus and A. plebs.",M1
20232477,"Prolonged stimulus exposure reveals prolonged neurobehavioral response patterns.Although it has been shown repeatedly that minimum response times in sensory systems can be quite short, organisms more often continue to respond to sensory stimuli over considerably longer periods of time. The continuing response to sensory stimulation may be a more realistic assessment of natural sensory responses, so we determined for how long a stimulus would evoke a response in naïve, freely moving animals. Specifically, we determined for how long such rats responded to odorants during continuous passive exposures by monitoring their sniffing with whole-body plethysmography. We found that naïve rats continue to sniff odorants vigorously for up to 3 minutes, much longer than what has been reported for highly trained, highly motivated rats. Patterns of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in the glomerular layer of the rat olfactory bulb also were seen after only 1-5 minutes of odorant exposure, overlapping with the period of increased <e>respiration</e> to odorants. Moreover, these 2-DG uptake patterns closely resembled the patterns that emerge from prolonged odorant exposures, suggesting that activity mapping over prolonged periods can identify areas of activity that are present when rats are still attending and responding to odorant stimuli. Given these findings, it seems important to consider the possibility that prolonged exposure to other sensory stimuli will reveal more realistic neural response patterns.",M1
20217380,"Respiratory response toward olfactory stimuli might be an index for odor-induced emotion and recognition.Olfaction is a unique sensory modality. Odor molecules reach olfactory receptors by inspiration, and odor information projects directly to limbic structures not through the thalamus. Odor stimuli thus induce respiratory changes, and simultaneously induce emotion and memory recognition via stimulation of olfactory-related limbic structures. We review the relations between <e>respiration</e> and olfaction, and between brain rhythm and respiration from our studies in normal subjects and in patients with Parkinson's disease who had been reported to have olfactory impairment.",M1
20217323,"A simplified model for explaining negative feedback to beginners in life sciences.It may not be easy to present to beginners CO(2) and O(2) having the opposite effect on <e>respiration</e>, using the conventional diagram explaining negative feedback. In the new diagram we developed, the  cause , its facilitating effect on the  result , the facilitating and inhibiting noises on the  result , the current magnitude of the  result , the set-point, their comparison, and feedback effect on the  cause  are all clearly illustrated. For example, the engine RPM is the  cause , increase in speed is the  result , a downhill slope is the facilitating noise, and an uphill slope is the inhibiting noise. By having direction in the  result , such as INCREASE in speed, INCREASE in O(2), and DECREASE in CO(2), the same diagram could be used to present CO(2) and O(2) having the opposite effect on respiration.",M1

20207656,"Environmental toxins and Parkinson's disease: putative roles of impaired electron transport chain and oxidative stress.Despite recent advancements in the biomedical fields, the etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still poorly understood, though the crucial roles of oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> have been suggested in the development of PD. The oxidative modification of the proteins of mitochondrial electron transport chain alters their normal function leading to the state of energy crisis in neurons. Exposure of environmental chemicals such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and rotenone in mouse produces the symptoms akin to PD and therefore these neurotoxins are commonly used in experimental studies on PD. Another environmental toxin, paraquat (a commonly used herbicide) has also been implicated with the onset of PD. The neurotoxicity of these chemicals is accompanied by the blockade of electron flow from NADH dehydrogenase to coenzyme Q. The agents with the ability to improve mitochondrial respiration and ATP production have been shown to exert beneficial effects in PD patients as well as in the animal models of PD. This review summarizes the current research implicating the impairment of mitochondrial respiratory chain and the role of environmental toxins in the pathogenesis of PD.",M1
20207501,"Interfraction and intrafraction changes in amplitude of breathing motion in stereotactic liver radiotherapy.PURPOSE: Interfraction and intrafraction changes in amplitude of liver motion were assessed in patients with liver cancer treated with kV cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 314 CBCTs obtained with the patient in the treatment position immediately before and after each fraction, and 29 planning 4DCTs were evaluated in 29 patients undergoing six-fraction SBRT for unresectable liver cancer, with (n = 15) and without (n = 14) abdominal compression. Offline, the CBCTs were sorted into 10 bins, based on phase of <e>respiration</e>. Liver motion amplitude was measured using liver-to-liver alignment from the end-exhale and end-inhale CBCT and four-dimensional CT reconstructions. Inter- and intrafraction amplitude changes were measured from the difference between the pre-SBRT CBCTs relative to the planning four-dimensional CT, and from the pre-SBRT and post-SBRT CBCTs, respectively. RESULTS: Mean liver motion amplitude for all patients (range) was 1.8 (0.1-7.0), 8.0 (0.1-18.8), and 4.3 (0.1-12.1) mm in the mediolateral (ML), craniocaudal (CC), and anteroposterior (AP) directions, respectively. Mean absolute inter- and intrafraction liver motion amplitude changes were 1.0 (ML), 1.7 (CC), and 1.6 (AP) mm and 1.3 (ML), 1.6 (CC), and 1.9 (AP) mm, respectively. No significant correlations were found between intrafraction amplitude change and intrafraction time (range, 4:56-25:37 min:sec), and between inter- and intrafraction amplitude changes and liver motion amplitude. Intraobserver reproducibility (sigma, n = 29 fractions) was 1.3 (ML), 1.4 (CC), and 1.4 (AP) mm. CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of liver SBRT patients, the change in liver motion amplitude was minimal over the treatment course and showed no apparent relationships with the magnitude of liver motion and intrafraction time.",M1
20193954,"Speech breathing in speakers who use an electrolarynx.Speakers who use an electrolarynx following a total laryngectomy no longer require pulmonary support for speech. Subsequently, chest wall movements may be affected; however, chest wall movements in these speakers are not well defined. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate speech breathing in speakers who use an electrolarynx during speech and reading tasks. Six speakers who use an electrolarynx underwent an evaluation of chest wall kinematics (e.g., chest wall movements, temporal characteristics of chest wall movement), lung volumes, temporal measures of speech, and the interaction of linguistic influences on ventilation. Results of the present study were compared to previous reports in speakers who use an electrolarynx, as well as to previous reports in typical speakers. There were no significant differences in lung volumes used and the general movement of the chest wall by task; however, there were differences of note in the temporal aspects of chest wall configuration when compared to previous reports in both typical speakers and speakers who use an electrolarynx. These differences were related to timing and posturing of the chest wall. The lack of differences in lung volumes and chest wall movements by task indicates that neither reading nor spontaneous speech exerts a greater influence on speech breathing; however, the temporal and posturing results suggest the possibility of a decoupling of the respiratory system from speech following a total laryngectomy and subsequent alaryngeal speech rehabilitation. LEARNING OUTCOMES: The reader will be able to understand and describe: (1) The primary differences in speech breathing across alaryngeal speech options; (2) how speech breathing specifically differs (i.e., lung volumes and chest wall movements) in speakers who use an electrolarynx; (3) How the coupling of speech and <e>respiration</e> is altered when pulmonary air is no longer used for speech.",M1
20171800,"Evaluation of the effectiveness of the stereotactic body frame in reducing respiratory intrafractional organ motion using the real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy system.PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the stereotactic body frame (SBF), with or without a diaphragm press or a breathing cycle monitoring device (Abches), in controlling the range of lung tumor motion, by tracking the real-time position of fiducial markers. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The trajectories of gold markers in the lung were tracked with the real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy system. The SBF was used for patient immobilization and the diaphragm press and Abches were used to actively control breathing and for self-controlled <e>respiration</e>, respectively. Tracking was performed in five setups, with and without immobilization and respiration control. The results were evaluated using the effective range, which was defined as the range that includes 95% of all the recorded marker positions in each setup. RESULTS: The SBF, with or without a diaphragm press or Abches, did not yield effective ranges of marker motion which were significantly different from setups that did not use these materials. The differences in the effective marker ranges in the upper lobes for all the patient setups were less than 1mm. Larger effective ranges were obtained for the markers in the middle or lower lobes. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of controlling respiratory-induced organ motion by using the SBF+diaphragm press or SBF + Abches patient setups were highly dependent on the individual patient reaction to the use of these materials and the location of the markers. They may be considered for lung tumors in the lower lobes, but are not necessary for tumors in the upper lobes.",M1
20171727,"Representation of the speech effectors in the human motor cortex: somatotopy or overlap?Somatotopy within the orofacial region of the human motor cortex has been a central concept in interpreting the results of neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies of normal and disordered speech. Yet, somatotopy has been challenged by studies showing overlap among the effectors within the homunculus. In order to address this dichotomy, we performed four voxel-based meta-analyses of 54 functional neuroimaging studies of non-speech tasks involving <e>respiration</e>, lip movement, tongue movement, and swallowing, respectively. While the centers of mass of the clusters supported the classic homuncular view of the motor cortex, there was significant variability in the locations of the activation-coordinates among studies, resulting in an overlapping arrangement. This  somatotopy with overlap  might reflect the intrinsic functional interconnectedness of the oral effectors for speech production.",M1
20168130,"Respiratory physiology of seizures.Comonitoring of seizures and respiratory function with pulse oximetry has shown that ictal respiratory changes (IRCs) accompany tonic-clonic convulsions and even partial seizures, especially those of temporal lobe origin. IRCs occur in children and adults, and diminished central drive is frequent, although peripheral obstruction is observed occasionally. Case reports of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) have suggested IRC as a mechanism. In a series of 15 witnessed SUDEP cases, overt convulsions with marked respiratory difficulty were observed in 12. For two cases, obstructive mechanisms may have predominated. One near-SUDEP case implicated central apnea, but another case implicated postictal laryngospasm. Inhibition of brainstem respiratory control circuits likely subserves IRCs. The pre-Bötzinger complex in the rostral ventrolateral medulla is a key locus for respiratory rhythm generation, with expiratory control neurons near the nucleus ambiguous. Inputs to these neurons descend from the insula, hypothalamus, and reticular formation. Direct stimulation of limbic targets in humans causes apnea. Animal models of focal seizures with IRCs and SUDEP have produced inconsistent results: some support central mechanisms, whereas others implicate peripheral obstruction. Serotonin seems relevant in a mouse model of SUDEP. These models may elucidate how seizures embarrass <e>respiration</e> and possibly predispose patients to SUDEP.",M1
20147775,"Comparison of respiratory-induced variations in photoplethysmographic signals.Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical method for detecting blood volume changes in tissue. Respiratory-induced intensity, frequency and amplitude variations are contained in the PPG signal; thus, an understanding of the relationships between all of these variations and <e>respiration</e> is essential to advancing respiration monitoring based on PPG. This study investigated correlations between respiratory-induced variations extracted from PPG and simultaneous respiratory signals. PPG signals were recorded from 28 healthy subjects under eight different conditions. Six respiratory-induced variations, i.e. the period of the systole, diastole and pulse, the amplitude of the systole and diastole, and the intensity variation, were determined from the PPG signal. The results indicate that, compared with the period of the pulse, the period of the systole and diastole correlates weakly with respiration; the amplitude of the diastole has a stronger correlation with respiration than the amplitude of the systole. For men, when the respiratory rate is less than 10 breaths min(-1), the period of the pulse has the strongest correlation with respiration, whereas up to or above 15 breaths min(-1), the intensity variation becomes strongest in the sitting posture, while the amplitude of the diastole is strongest in the supine posture. For women, compared with the other variations, the period of the pulse has nearly the strongest correlation with respiration, independent of respiratory rate or posture.",M1

20134084,"Kernel density estimation-based real-time prediction for respiratory motion.Effective delivery of adaptive radiotherapy requires locating the target with high precision in real time. System latency caused by data acquisition, streaming, processing and delivery control necessitates prediction. Prediction is particularly challenging for highly mobile targets such as thoracic and abdominal tumors undergoing <e>respiration</e>-induced motion. The complexity of the respiratory motion makes it difficult to build and justify explicit models. In this study, we honor the intrinsic uncertainties in respiratory motion and propose a statistical treatment of the prediction problem. Instead of asking for a deterministic covariate-response map and a unique estimate value for future target position, we aim to obtain a distribution of the future target position (response variable) conditioned on the observed historical sample values (covariate variable). The key idea is to estimate the joint probability distribution (pdf) of the covariate and response variables using an efficient kernel density estimation method. Then, the problem of identifying the distribution of the future target position reduces to identifying the section in the joint pdf based on the observed covariate. Subsequently, estimators are derived based on this estimated conditional distribution. This probabilistic perspective has some distinctive advantages over existing deterministic schemes: (1) it is compatible with potentially inconsistent training samples, i.e., when close covariate variables correspond to dramatically different response values; (2) it is not restricted by any prior structural assumption on the map between the covariate and the response; (3) the two-stage setup allows much freedom in choosing statistical estimates and provides a full nonparametric description of the uncertainty for the resulting estimate. We evaluated the prediction performance on ten patient RPM traces, using the root mean squared difference between the prediction and the observed value normalized by the standard deviation of the observed data as the error metric. Furthermore, we compared the proposed method with two benchmark methods: most recent sample and an adaptive linear filter. The kernel density estimation-based prediction results demonstrate universally significant improvement over the alternatives and are especially valuable for long lookahead time, when the alternative methods fail to produce useful predictions.",M1
20133069,"Gated treatment delivery verification with on-line megavoltage fluoroscopy.PURPOSE: To develop and clinically demonstrate the use of on-line real-time megavoltage (MV) fluoroscopy for gated treatment delivery verification. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Megavoltage fluoroscopy (MVF) image sequences were acquired using a flat panel equipped for MV cone-beam CT in synchrony with the respiratory signal obtained from the Anzai gating device. The MVF images can be obtained immediately before or during gated treatment delivery. A prototype software tool (named RTReg4D) was developed to register MVF images with phase-sequenced digitally reconstructed radiograph images generated from the treatment planning system based on four-dimensional CT. The image registration can be used to reposition the patient before or during treatment delivery. To demonstrate the reliability and clinical usefulness, the system was first tested using a thoracic phantom and then prospectively in actual patient treatments under an institutional review board-approved protocol. RESULTS: The quality of the MVF images for lung tumors is adequate for image registration with phase-sequenced digitally reconstructed radiographs. The MVF was found to be useful for monitoring inter- and intrafractional variations of tumor positions. With the planning target volume contour displayed on the MVF images, the system can verify whether the moving target stays within the planning target volume margin during gated delivery. CONCLUSIONS: The use of MVF images was found to be clinically effective in detecting discrepancies in tumor location before and during <e>respiration</e>-gated treatment delivery. The tools and process developed can be useful for gated treatment delivery verification.",M1
20128395,"The role of carbon dioxide (and intracellular pH) in the pathomechanism of several mental disorders. Are the diseases of civilization caused by learnt behaviour, not the stress itself?The role of carbon dioxide (CO2) is underestimated in the pathomechanism of neuropsychiatric disorders, though it is an important link between psyche and corpus. The actual spiritual status also influences <e>respiration</e> (we start breathing rarely, frequently, irregularly, etc.) causing pH alteration in the organism; on the other hand the actual cytosolic pH of neurons is one of the main modifiers of Ca2+-conductance, hence breathing directly, quickly, and effectively influences the second messenger system through Ca2+-currents. (Decreasing pCO2 turns pH into alkalic direction, augments psychic arousal, while increasing pCO2 turns pH acidic, diminishes arousal.) One of the most important homeostatic function is to maintain or restore the permanence of H+-concentration, hence the alteration of CO2 level starts cascades of contraregulation. However it can be proved that there is no perfect compensation, therefore compensational mechanisms may generate psychosomatic disorders causing secondary alterations in the  milieu interieur . Authors discuss the special physico-chemical features of CO2, the laws of interweaving alterations of pCO2 and catecholamine levels (their feedback mechanism), the role of acute and chronic hypocapnia in several hyperarousal disorders (delirium, panic disorder, hyperventilation syndrome, generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder), the role of  locus minoris resistentiae  in the pathomechanism of psychosomatic disorders. It is supposed that the diseases of civilization are caused not by the stress itself but the lack of human instinctive reaction to it, and this would cause long-lasting CO2 alteration. Increased brain-pCO2, acidic cytosol pH and/or increased basal cytosolic Ca2+ level diminish inward Ca2+-current into cytosol, decrease arousal--they may cause dysthymia or depression. This state usually co-exists with ATP-deficiency and decreased cytosolic Mg2+ content. This energetical- and ion-constellation is also typical of ageing-associated and chronic organic disorders. It is the most important link between depression and organic disorders (e.g. coronary heart disease). The above-mentioned model is supported by the fact that H+ and/or Ca2+ metabolism is affected by several drugs (catecholemines, serotonin, lithium, triaecetyluridine, thyroxine) and sleep deprivation, they act for the logically right direction.",M1

20093078,"Impact of sleeping position on central sleep apnea/Cheyne-Stokes <e>respiration</e> in patients with heart failure.BACKGROUND: The present study determines the influence of sleeping position on central sleep apnea (CSA) in patients with heart failure (HF). METHODS: The apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) during different body positions while asleep was examined by cardiorespiratory polygraphy in 71 patients with HF (ejection fraction &lt;45%). RESULTS: Twenty-five of the patients having predominantly CSA (central apnea index 10/h) with a lower obstructive apnea index (&lt;5/h) were assigned to groups with positional (lateral to supine ratio of AHI &lt;50%, n=12) or non-positional (ratio &gt; or = 50%, n=13) CSA. In the non-positional group the BNP level was higher, the ejection fraction was lower and the trans-tricuspid pressure gradient was higher than in the positional group. Multiple regression analysis revealed more advanced age (p=0.006), log(10)BNP (p=0.017) and lung-to-finger circulation time (p=0.020) as independent factors of the degree of positional CSA. Intensive treatment for HF changed CSA from non-positional to positional in all eight patients tested. Single night of positional therapy reduced CSA (p&lt;0.05) and BNP level (p=0.07) in seven positional patients. CONCLUSION: As cardiac dysfunction progresses, severity of CSA also increases and positional CSA becomes position-independent. Positional therapy could decrease CSA, thereby having a valuable effect on HF.",M1
20071616,"Species differences in respiratory rhythm generation in rodents.We examined the role of riluzole (RIL)- and flufenamic acid (FFA)-sensitive mechanisms in respiratory rhythmogenesis in rats and hamsters using the in situ arterially perfused preparation. Based on the hypothesis that respiratory networks in animals capable of autoresuscitation would have a greater prevalence of membrane mechanisms that promote endogenous bursting, we predicted that older (weaned) hamsters (a hibernating species) would be more sensitive to the blockade of RIL- and FFA-sensitive mechanisms than age-matched rats and that younger (preweaned) rats would behave more like hamsters. Consistent with this, we found that respiratory motor output in weaned hamsters [&gt;21 days postnatal (P21)] was highly sensitive to RIL (0.2-20 muM), while in young rats (P12-14) it was less so (only affected at higher concentrations of RIL), and weaned rats were not affected at all. On the other hand, respiratory motor output was equally reduced by FFA (0.25-25 muM) in both young and weaned rats but was unaffected in weaned hamsters. Coapplication of RIL and FFA (RIL + FFA) produced greater inhibition of <e>respiration</e> in both young and weaned rats compared with either drug alone. In contrast, in weaned hamsters, FFA coapplication offset the inhibitory effect of RIL alone. Increasing respiratory drive with hypercapnia/acidosis ameliorated the respiratory inhibition produced by RIL + FFA in weaned rats but had no effect in young rats. Data from the present study indicate that respiratory rhythmogenesis in young rats is more dependent on excitatory RIL-sensitive and FFA-sensitive mechanisms than older rats and that fundamental differences exist in the respiratory rhythmogenic mechanisms between rats and hamsters.",M1
20064744,"Cheyne-Stokes <e>respiration</e> in heart failure: cycle length is dependent on left ventricular ejection fraction.BACKGROUND: Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) is common in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and is associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to analyse the characteristics of CSR in patients with varying degrees of impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). METHODS: A total of 104 patients with CSR (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]15/h) and exertional dyspnea were divided into FIVE groups according to their LVEF (&lt;20% upto 50%). A subgroup of 22 patients was studied twice: 15 in whom LVEF improved between studies and 7 in whom LVEF deteriorated. Using cardiorespiratory polygraphy recordings, cycle length (CL), apnea length (AL), ventilation length (VL), time to peak ventilation (TTPV), circulatory delay (CD) and VL:AL ratio were determined. RESULTS: There was no relationship between AHI and impairment of LVEF, but the characteristics of CSR were related to LV function. Comparing the groups with the best LVEF (&gt;50%) and the worst LVEF (&lt;20%), there were significant increases in CL (49+/-17-86+/-23s), AL (21+/-9-31+/-10s), VL (28+/-10-55+/-17s), TTPV (19+/-5-32+/-11s), VL:AL ratio (1.5+/-0.4-1.9+/-0.7s) and CD (29+/-8-49+/-16s). In the subgroup of patients who were studied twice, improvement in EF was associated with a decrease in these parameters. CONCLUSION: The current classification of CSR in CHF patients using AHI may be overly simplistic. Parameters such as CL, VL, TTPV and CD are related to cardiac function and could potentially be used for disease monitoring.",M1
20063778,"[Study of cardiac, respiratory, and motor activity in rat fetuses]Development of the cardiac, respiratory, and motor activity was studied in rat fetuses with preserved placenta circulation was studied at the 16th, 18th, and 20th gestation days. The presence of three main movement types has been found: complexes of generalization activity, local movements, and jerks. In development of respiratory function, there is observed a gradual transition from individual inspirations to series of respiratory movements and then to formation of periodic <e>respiration</e> episodes. At the studied period, the heart rate has been found to increase. The existence of the slow-wave modulations it the heart rate with a period of 20-40 s has been revealed. Analysis of interrelations between the respiratory and motor systems has shown that in the 16-day fetuses, each respiratory movement is accompanied by extensor jerk. By the 20th days of embryonic development (E20), uncoupling of the respiratory and motor activities occurs. Comparison of the activity observed in the cardiac and somatomotor systems has shown that at E16, the cardiac rhythm fluctuations do not depend on the motor excitation jerks. In the 18-day fetuses, brief slowing down (decelerations) of the cardiac rhythm appeared during the motor activity jerks, whereas at E20, on the contrary, an increase of frequency (accelerations) of the cardiac rhythm occurred.",M1
20063777,"[Secondary rhythms of automatically functioning systems]In wakeful rats at the age from newborn to 3 weeks there were studied interrelations of rhythmical fluctuations of heart rate, <e>respiration</e> rate, and periodic spontaneous motor activity. In all studied systems, these fluctuations are coordinated and occur in several frequency diapasons. Frequencies in the periminute diapason (the period from 30 to 90 s) are the most constant and do not change with age. Regular fluctuations are the most stable in newborns. Bursts of motor activity usually are irregular, but episodically the distinct periminute rhythm is traced. Studies of the character of interaction of the heart activity, respiration, and periodic somatomotor excitation allow stating that the main coordination pathway of spontaneous autorhythmical functions in early postnatal ontogenesis is formation of secondary rhythms. Possible pathway of formation of the secondary rhythms are considered.",M1
20033333,"A prototype percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography training simulator with real-time breathing motion.PURPOSE: We present here a simulator for interventional radiology focusing on percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC). This procedure consists of inserting a needle into the biliary tree using fluoroscopy for guidance. METHODS: The requirements of the simulator have been driven by a task analysis. The three main components have been identified: the <e>respiration</e>, the real-time X-ray display (fluoroscopy) and the haptic rendering (sense of touch). The framework for modelling the respiratory motion is based on kinematics laws and on the Chainmail algorithm. The fluoroscopic simulation is performed on the graphic card and makes use of the Beer-Lambert law to compute the X-ray attenuation. Finally, the haptic rendering is integrated to the virtual environment and takes into account the soft-tissue reaction force feedback and maintenance of the initial direction of the needle during the insertion. RESULTS: Five training scenarios have been created using patient-specific data. Each of these provides the user with variable breathing behaviour, fluoroscopic display tuneable to any device parameters and needle force feedback. CONCLUSIONS: A detailed task analysis has been used to design and build the PTC simulator described in this paper. The simulator includes real-time respiratory motion with two independent parameters (rib kinematics and diaphragm action), on-line fluoroscopy implemented on the Graphics Processing Unit and haptic feedback to feel the soft-tissue behaviour of the organs during the needle insertion.",M1
20033306,"Effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid on the Hering-Breuer inspiration-inhibiting reflex.Acute experiments on rats were performed to study the effects of intraventricular microinjections of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the volume-time parameters of external <e>respiration</e> and the inspiration-inhibiting Hering-Breuer reflex. The state of this reflex before and after GABA administration was assessed in terms of the extent of changes in the duration and amplitude of inspiratory oscillations in intrathoracic pressure in response to end-expiratory occlusion of the trachea. Administration of 20 microM GABA into the lateral ventricles of the brain decreased the minute ventilation (due to reductions in the respiratory frequency and respiratory volume), weakened respiratory muscle contractions, and decreased the peak airflow rate on inspiration and expiration. The response to end-expiratory occlusion decreased significantly after administration of GABA, demonstrating the involvement of GABAergic mechanisms in mediating the inspiration-inhibiting Hering-Breuer reflex.",M1
20012144,"Postural change alters autonomic responses to breath-holding.OBJECTIVE: We used breath-holding during inspiration as a model to study the effect of pulmonary stretch on sympathetic nerve activity. METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects (7 females, 5 males; 19-27 years) were tested while they performed an inspiratory breath-hold, both supine and during a 60 degrees head-up tilt (HUT 60). Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), <e>respiration</e>, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) and end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)) were recorded. Cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were calculated. RESULTS: While breath-holding, ETCO(2) increased significantly from 41 +/- 2 to 60 +/- 2 Torr during supine (p &lt; 0.05) and 38 +/- 2 Torr to 58 +/- 2 during HUT60 (p &lt; 0.05); SaO(2) decreased from 98 +/- 1.5% to 95 +/- 1.4% supine, and from 97 +/- 1.5% to 94 +/- 1.7% during HUT60 (p = NS). MSNA showed three distinctive phases, a quiescent phase due to pulmonary stretch associated with decreased MAP, HR, CO, and TPR; a second phase of baroreflex-mediated elevated MSNA which was associated with recovery of MAP and HR only during HUT60; CO and peripheral resistance returned to baseline while supine and HUT60; a third phase of further increased MSNA activity related to hypercapnia and associated with increased TPR. INTERPRETATION: Breath-holding results in initial reductions of MSNA, MAP, and HR by the pulmonary stretch reflex followed by increased sympathetic activity related to the arterial baroreflex and chemoreflex.",M1
20003120,"Inferior vena cava percentage collapse during <e>respiration</e> is affected by the sampling location: an ultrasound study in healthy volunteers.OBJECTIVES: Physicians are unable to reliably determine intravascular volume status through the clinical examination. Respiratory variation in the diameter of the inferior vena cava (IVC) has been investigated as a noninvasive marker of intravascular volume status; however, there has been a lack of standardization across investigations. The authors evaluated three locations along the IVC to determine if there is clinical equivalence of the respiratory percent collapse at these sites. The objective of this study was to determine the importance of location when measuring the IVC diameter during quiet respiration. METHODS: Measurements of the IVC were obtained during quiet passive respiration in supine healthy volunteers. All images were recorded in B-mode, with cine-loop adjustments in real time, to ensure that maximum and minimum IVC dimensions were obtained. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison of IVC measurement sites. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) percentage collapse was 20% (+/-16%) at the level of the diaphragm, 30% (+/-21%) at the level of the hepatic vein inlet, and 35% (+/-22%) at the level of the left renal vein. ANOVA revealed a significant overall effect for location of measurement, with F(2,35) = 6.00 and p = 0.006. Contrasts showed that the diaphragm percentage collapse was significantly smaller than the hepatic (F(1,36) = 5.14; p = 0.03) or renal caval index (F(1,36) = 11.85; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of respiratory variation in IVC collapse in healthy volunteers are equivalent at the level of the left renal vein and at 2 cm caudal to the hepatic vein inlet. Measurements taken at the junction of the right atrium and IVC are not equivalent to the other sites; clinicians should avoid measuring percentage collapse of the IVC at this location.",M1
19999365,"<e>Respiration</e>-related laryngeal electromyography in children with bilateral vocal fold paralysis.We present 2 case reports to demonstrate the relationship between laryngeal muscle activity and respiration in children with bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP) by simultaneous laryngeal electromyography (EMG) with recording of chest wall movement and intercostal muscle EMG. Laryngeal EMG was performed together with recording of chest wall movement in a 55-day-old girl who was undergoing tracheostomy for idiopathic congenital BVFP. Normal phasic activity was observed, i.e., the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle was active during expiration and the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle during inspiration, suggesting a good prognosis for recovery. The child was decannulated at 11 months. Laryngeal EMG together with recording of chest wall movement and intercostal EMG in a 5-year-old girl who was tracheostomy-dependent following tracheoesophageal fistula repair due to BVFP showed phasic activity during expiration for both the TA and PCA muscles, indicating aberrant regeneration of the PCA motor nerve. The timing of laryngeal muscle activity with respiration in the assessment of pediatric congenital BVFP is essential to demonstrate the presence of normal or abnormal medullary respiratory neuronal input to laryngeal motoneurons. In cases in which BVFP is due to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, respiration-related laryngeal EMG will identify aberrant regeneration. Laryngeal EMG should be combined with intercostal muscle EMG in the evaluation of children with significant vocal fold dyfunction of either central or peripheral origin.",M1
19994528,"Characterization of free breathing patterns with 5D lung motion model.PURPOSE: To determine the quiet <e>respiration</e> breathing motion model parameters for lung cancer and nonlung cancer patients. METHODS: 49 free breathing patient 4DCT image datasets (25 scans, cine mode) were collected with simultaneous quantitative spirometry. A cross-correlation registration technique was employed to track the lung tissue motion between scans. The registration results were applied to a lung motion model: X(--&gt;) = X(--&gt;)0 + alpha(--&gt;)v + beta(--&gt;)f, where X(--&gt;) is the position of a piece of tissue located at reference position X(--&gt;)0 during a reference breathing phase (zero tidal volume v, zero airflow f). alpha(--&gt;) is a parameter that characterizes the motion due to air filling (motion as a function of tidal volume v) and beta(--&gt;) is the parameter that accounts for the motion due to the imbalance of dynamical stress distributions during inspiration and exhalation that causes lung motion hysteresis (motion as a function of airflow f). The parameters alpha(--&gt;) and beta(--&gt;) together provide a quantitative characterization of breathing motion that inherently includes the complex hysteresis interplay. The alpha(--&gt;) and beta(--&gt;) distributions were examined for each patient to determine overall general patterns and interpatient pattern variations. RESULTS: For 44 patients, the greatest values of /alpha(--&gt;)/ were observed in the inferior and posterior lungs. For the rest of the patients, /alpha(--&gt;)/ reached its maximum in the anterior lung in three patients and the lateral lung in two patients. The hysteresis motion beta(--&gt;) had greater variability, but for the majority of patients, /beta(--&gt;)/ was largest in the lateral lungs. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the three-dimensional breathing motion model parameters for a large cohort of patients. The model has the potential for noninvasively predicting lung motion. The majority of patients exhibited similar /alpha(--&gt;)/ maps and the /beta(--&gt;)/ maps showed greater interpatient variability. The motion parameter interpatient variability will inform our need for custom radiation therapy motion models. The utility of this model depends on the parameter stability over time, which is still under investigation.",M1
19964384,"A remote monitor of bed patient cardiac vibration, <e>respiration</e> and movement.We have developed a remote system for monitoring heart rate, respiration rate and movement behavior of at-home elderly people who are living alone. The system consists of a 40 kHz ultrasonic transmitter and receiver, linear integrated circuits, a low-power 8-bit single chip microcomputer and an Internet server computer. The 40 kHz ultrasonic transmitter and receiver are installed into a bed mattress. The transmitted signal diffuses into the bed mattress, and the amplitude of the received ultrasonic wave is modulated by the shape of the mattress and parameters such as respiration, cardiac vibration and movement. The modulated ultrasonic signal is received and demodulated by an envelope detection circuit. Low, high and band pass filters separate the respiration, cardiac vibration and movement signals, which are fed into the microcontroller and digitized at a sampling rate of 50 Hz by 8-bit A/D converters. The digitized data are sent to the server computer as a serial signal. This computer stores the data and also creates a graphic chart of the latest hour. The person's family or caregiver can download this chart via the Internet at any time.",M1

We are investigating an alternative to PSG in which unobtrusive load cells fitted under the bed are used to monitor movement, heart rate, and <e>respiration</e>.

This study proposes the characterization of respiratory patterns in CHF patients and healthy subjects using the envelope of the respiratory flow signal, and autoregressive (AR) time-frequency analysis. In time-varying respiratory patterns, the statistical distribution of the AR coefficients, pole locations, and the spectral parameters that characterize the discriminant band are evaluated to identify typical breathing patterns. In order to evaluate the accuracy of this characterization, a feature selection process followed by linear discriminant analysis is applied. 26 CHF patients (8 patients with PB pattern and 18 with non-periodic breathing pattern (nPB)) are studied. The results show an accuracy of 83.9% with the mean of the main pole magnitude and the mean of the total power, when classifying CHF patients versus healthy subjects, and 83.3% for nPB versus healthy subjects. The best result when classifying CHF patients into PB and nPB was an accuracy of 88.9%, using the coefficient of variation of the first AR coefficient and the mean of the total power.",M1

19963644,"<e>Respiration</e> triggered magnetic drug targeting in the lungs.Lung cancer kills per year 1.3 million people worldwide. It is the most fatal cancer type as far as men are concerned and the second deadliest for women. One of the recent technologies to treat carcinomas in the lungs consists in delivering drugs through the pulmonary pathways directly to the tumor cells over actively loaded superparamagnetic nanoparticles that are encapsulated in aerosols and guided by external magnetic fields. However, first implementations of this technique assumed a continuous application of the magnetic field all through the inspiration and expiration phases of the artificial respiratory act that supplies the patient. We observed that applying the field this way forced the magnetic aerosols to sediment at regions far from the target, mainly in the trachea and main bronchioles, because of the force inducing magnetic field gradients that are present over the whole field application area. We developed an approach to avoid this effect by punctually generating the aerosol cloud exactly at the beginning of the inspiration phase, which would propel the particles to the deepest parts of the lung and therefore to the targeted cells as well, and by synchronizing the magnetic field activation with the breathing process. Our developed system analyzes the relevant respiration parameters such as pressure and flow and detects the end of the inspiration phase to trigger the magnet exactly at that point in time, when particles have reached the deepest alveoli, including the targeted zones, and do not experience forces due to the streaming any more. The magnetic field is then held on during the expiration phase to assure the retention of the aerosols at the targeted sites, which increases the efficiency and focality of the treatment. This way, only target cells are subjected to the deposition of the drug carrying aerosols, while the other healthy regions of the lungs remain unaltered by side effects.",M1
19949319,"The reinforcing, self-reported performance and physiological effects of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, triazolam, hydromorphone, and methylphenidate in cannabis users.The use of illicit prescription drugs is common in cannabis users; however, the effects of few psychoactive drugs have been characterized in this population. In this study, Delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (i.e. Delta-THC), triazolam, hydromorphone, and methylphenidate were administered to cannabis users (n=8). Subjects completed the multiple-choice procedure to assess drug reinforcement, as well as self-report questionnaires and performance tasks; physiological assessments were also conducted. Only Delta-THC increased the crossover point on the multiple-choice procedure, but all of the drugs increased ratings on one or more 'positive' drug-effect questionnaire items, as well as items specific for each drug. Triazolam produced the most robust performance impairment, except on a time reproduction task, which was impacted to a greater degree by Delta-THC. Delta-THC elevated heart rate and decreased temperature, triazolam increased heart rate, methylphenidate elevated all cardiovascular indices, and hydromorphone reduced <e>respiration</e>. The effects of the drugs tested in this study were generally consistent with their known pharmacology, although minimal responses to hydromorphone were observed.

19945442,"Inhibition of protein kinase G activity protects neonatal mouse respiratory network from hyperthermic and hypoxic stress.In spite of considerable research attention focused on clarifying the mechanisms by which the mammalian respiratory rhythm is generated, little attention has been given to examining how this neuronal circuit can be protected from heat stress. Hyperthermia has a profound effect on neuronal circuits including the circuit that generates breathing in mammals. As temperature of the brainstem increases, respiratory frequency concomitantly rises. If temperature continues to increase respiratory arrest (apnea) and death can occur. Previous research has implicated protein kinase G (PKG) activity in regulating neuronal thermosensitivity of neuronal circuits in invertebrates. Here we examine if pharmacological manipulation of PKG activity in a brainstem slice preparation could alter the thermosensitivity of the fictive neonatal mouse respiratory rhythm. We report a striking effect following alteration of PKG activity in the brainstem such that slices treated with the PKG inhibitor KT5823 recovered fictive respiratory rhythm generation significantly faster than control slices and slices treated with a PKG activator (8-Br-cGMP). Furthermore, slices treated with 8-Br-cGMP arrested fictive <e>respiration</e> at a significantly lower temperature than all other treatment groups. In a separate set of experiments we examined if altered PKG activity could regulate the response of slices to hypoxia by altering the protective switch to fictive gasping. Slices treated with 8-Br-cGMP did not switch to the fictive gasp-like pattern following exposure to hypoxia whereas slices treated with KT5823 did display fictive gasping. We propose that PKG activity inversely regulates the amount of stress the neonatal mammalian respiratory rhythm can endure.",M1
19941896,"Correction of low-frequency physiological noise from the resting state BOLD fMRI--Effect on ICA default mode analysis at 1.5 T.Confounding low-frequency fluctuation (LFF) physiological noise is a concern for functional connectivity analyses in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using estimates of LFF physiological noise derived from measured cardiac and <e>respiration</e> signals, noise can be filtered from the time series thus improving the results of functional connectivity analysis. The ability of spatial independent component analysis (ICA) to separate LFF physiological noise from the default mode network (DMN), which overlap each other spatially and occur at similar frequencies, has remained an open question. We aimed to define the net effect of physiological correction for spatial ICA DMN detection at 1.5 T by statistically testing obtained ICASSO centrotype DMN maps before and after physiological correction. Comparisons with 21 subjects were performed for ICA model orders 20, 30 and 40 and no statistically significant spatial difference was found after physiological correction, although slight DMN reduction in precuneus or sagittal sinus was detected in all dimensionalities. A confounding factor in the analysis is the susceptibility of the ICA decomposition for data changes yielding different DMN splitting between and after physiological correction conditions without comparable true change in the data. This issue is mitigated at higher ICA model orders. The results suggest that subject-level DMN can for some subjects be optimized by physiological correction, but on the group-level this contribution is minor.",M1
19931739,"Respiratory motion changes of lung tumors over the course of radiation therapy based on <e>respiration</e>-correlated four-dimensional computed tomography scans.PURPOSE: To determine whether lung tumor respiratory excursion at simulation is predictive of excursion during radiation and whether phase offsets between tumor and surrogate markers are constant throughout treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Respiration-correlated CT scans and two rescans (using a Brilliance Big Bore spiral CT simulator; Philips, Inc.) were obtained from 20 patients at simulation. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was contoured on 10 phases of the respiratory cycle, and excursions were calculated. Diaphragm and xyphoid motion were quantified. Phase offsets, DeltaPhi, were calculated for patients with a GTV motion of &gt;3 mm. Interfraction differences in excursions between simulation and rescans and magnitudes of variation in phase offset between fractions were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean GTV excursions at simulation in superior-inferior, anterior-posterior, and medial-lateral directions were 0.67, 0.29, and 0.21 cm, respectively. The magnitude of superior-inferior GTV excursion correlated with tumor location (upper vs. lower lobe, p = 0.011). GTV excursions between simulation and rescan 1 (p = 0.115) and between simulation and rescan 2 (p = 0.071) were stable. Fourteen patients were analyzed for variations in phase offsets. GTV-xyphoid phase offset changed significantly between simulation and rescan 1 (p = 0.007) and simulation and rescan 2 (p = 0.008), with mean DeltaPhi values of 13.2% (rescan 1) and 14.3% (rescan 2). Xyphoid-diaphragm offset changed between simulation and rescan 1 (p = 0.004) and between simulation and rescan 2 (p = 0.012), with mean DeltaPhi values of 14.5% (rescan 1) and 7.6% (rescan 2). CONCLUSIONS: Interfraction consistency in tumor excursion suggests tumor excursion at simulation may direct therapy. Significant variations in phase lag between GTV and other anatomic structures throughout treatment have important implications for techniques that rely on surrogate structures to predict tumor motion.",M1
19926910,"The impact of respiratory motion on tumor quantification and delineation in static PET/CT imaging.Our aim is to investigate the impact of respiratory motion on tumor quantification and delineation in static PET/CT imaging using a population of patient respiratory traces. A total of 1295 respiratory traces acquired during whole body PET/CT imaging were classified into three types according to the qualitative shape of their signal histograms. Each trace was scaled to three diaphragm motion amplitudes (6 mm, 11 mm and 16 mm) to drive a whole body PET/CT computer simulation that was validated with a physical phantom experiment. Three lung lesions and one liver lesion were simulated with diameters of 1 cm and 2 cm. PET data were reconstructed using the OS-EM algorithm with attenuation correction using CT images at the end-expiration phase and respiratory-averaged CT. The errors of the lesion maximum standardized uptake values (SUV(max)) and lesion volumes between motion-free and motion-blurred PET/CT images were measured and analyzed. For <e>respiration</e> with 11 mm diaphragm motion and larger quiescent period fraction, respiratory motion can cause a mean lesion SUV(max) underestimation of 28% and a mean lesion volume overestimation of 130% in PET/CT images with 1 cm lesions. The errors of lesion SUV(max) and volume are larger for patient traces with larger motion amplitudes. Smaller lesions are more sensitive to respiratory motion than larger lesions for the same motion amplitude. Patient respiratory traces with relatively larger quiescent period fraction yield results less subject to respiratory motion than traces with long-term amplitude variability. Mismatched attenuation correction due to respiratory motion can cause SUV(max) overestimation for lesions in the lower lung region close to the liver dome. Using respiratory-averaged CT for attenuation correction yields smaller mismatch errors than those using end-expiration CT. Respiratory motion can have a significant impact on static oncological PET/CT imaging where SUV and/or volume measurements are important. The impact is highly dependent upon motion amplitude, lesion location and size, attenuation map and respiratory pattern. To overcome the motion effect, motion compensation techniques may be necessary in clinical practice to improve the tumor quantification for determining the response to therapy or for radiation treatment planning.",M1

19918227,"From phase-based to displacement-based gating: a software tool to facilitate <e>respiration</e>-gated radiation treatment.The Varian Real-time Position Management (RPM) system allows respiratory gating based on either the phase or displacement (amplitude) of the breathing waveform. A problem in clinical application is that phase-based gating, required for respiration-correlated (4D-CT) simulation, is not robust to irregular breathing patterns during treatment, and a widely used system version (1.6) does not provide an easy means to change from a phase-based gate into an equivalent displacement-based one. We report on the development and evaluation of a robust method to convert phase-gate thresholds, set by the physician, into equivalent displacement-gate thresholds to facilitate its clinical application to treatment. The software tool analyzes the respiration trace recorded during the 4D-CT simulation, and determines a relationship between displacement and phase through a functional fit. The displacement gate thresholds are determined from an average of two values of this function, corresponding to the start and end thresholds of the original phase gate. The software tool was evaluated in two ways: first, whether in-gate residual target motion and predicted treatment beam duty cycle are equivalent between displacement gating and phase gating during 4D-CT simulation (using retrospective phase recalculation); second, whether residual motion is improved with displacement gating during treatment relative to phase gating (using real-time phase calculation). Residual target motion was inferred from the respiration traces and quantified in terms of mean and standard deviation in-gate displacement measured relative to the value at the start of the recorded trace. For retrospectively-calculated breathing traces compared with real-time calculated breathing traces, we evaluate the inaccuracies of real-time phase calculation by measuring the phase gate position in each trace as well as the mean in-gate displacement and standard deviation of the displacement. Retrospectively-calculated data from ten patients were analyzed. The patient averaged in-gate mean +/- standard deviation displacement (representing residual motion) was reduced from 0.16 +/- 0.14 cm for phase gating under simulation conditions to 0.12 +/- 0.08 cm for displacement gating. Evaluation of respiration traces under treatment conditions (real-time phase calculation) showed that the average displacement gate threshold results in a lower in-gate mean and residual motion (variance) for all patients studied. The patient-averaged in-gate mean +/- standard deviation displacement was reduced from 0.26 +/- 0.18 cm for phase gating (under treatment conditions) to 0.15 +/- 0.09 cm for displacement gating. Real-time phase gating sometimes leads to gating on incorrect portions of the breathing cycle when the breathing trace is irregular.

We used 2 mildly trigeminal odorants: the pleasant lavender and unpleasant vetiver oil and 2 pure olfactory odorants: the pleasant vanillin and unpleasant ammonium sulfide. During sleep, an olfactometer delivered a transient odorant every 9, 12, or 15 min (randomized), providing 21-37 odorant presentations per night. Each of 36 participants was studied for 1 night and with 1 of the 4 different odorants tested. In addition to standard overnight polysomnography, we employed highly accurate measurements of nasal and oral <e>respiration</e>. Odorants did not increase the frequency of arousals or wake but did influence respiration. Specifically, all 4 odorants transiently decreased inhalation and increased exhalation for up to 6 breaths following odor onset. This effect persisted regardless of odorant valence or stage of sleep. These results suggest that the olfactory system may provide a path to manipulate respiration in sleep.",M1
19914979,"Phased versus midventilation attenuation-corrected <e>respiration</e>-correlated PET for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.Respiration-correlated PET (RCPET) can reduce motion artifacts, but image quality generally decreases. The use of phase-by-phase attenuation correction (PAC) for RCPET using respiration-correlated CT (RCCT) requires large computational resources, and tumor positions will not always match correctly because of different binning methods for CT and PET. In this study, we investigated whether PAC for RCPET can be replaced by midventilation attenuation correction (MidV-AC) for a group of lung cancer patients. METHODS: RCPET/CT scans of 19 non-small cell lung cancer patients were performed. List-mode PET and CT data were binned and reconstructed into 8 phases. Two AC methods for RCPET were applied. First, the corresponding 8 RCCT phases were used for PAC. Then MidV-AC was used. Analyses were performed in terms of standardized uptake values (SUVs), volume recovery, contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). RESULTS: Average differences between PAC and MidV-AC for mean and maximum SUV were 1.0% and 0.9% (P = 0.007 and P = 0.002), respectively, whereas SNR, contrast, and volume did not differ significantly (P &gt;or= 0.2). Large motion amplitudes and irregular breathing revealed larger differences between phase 1 and MidV-AC values. CONCLUSION: Differences in SUV, volume, SNR, and contrast between PAC as available in currently used clinical software and MidV-AC for RCPET are small. MidV-AC provides an excellent surrogate for PAC for most lung cancer patients encountered in clinical practice.",M1
19914893,"Respiratory sinus arrhythmia on the ESA-short-arm human centrifuge.In this article, we investigated the hypothesis that the effects of hypergravity on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) can mimic the effects observed after spaceflight cardiovascular deconditioning. Artificial gravity along the head-to-feet axis on a short-arm centrifuge induces gravity gradients. This physiological condition of significantly higher g at the feet than at the heart level is specific and likely induces blood sequestration in the lower limbs. After spaceflight, astronauts are in a condition of cardiovascular deconditioning, where blood pooling in the lower part of the body and autonomic adaptation are factors contributing to orthostatic intolerance and changes in heart-rate variability (HRV). ECG and <e>respiration</e> were recorded during imposed and controlled breathing (ICB) protocols, which were repeated at different levels of artificial gravity as well as during supine and standing control conditions, and the changes were analyzed.",M1

Epochs of fetal--maternal heart-rate coordination were identified in model data produced at varying respiratory rates and compared with epochs found in real data acquired in mother-fetus pairs. The model results suggest that the low incidence of epochs found in the real data at low-breathing rates may be explained by heart-rate characteristics, but that the higher incidence at fast rates must be due to other factors.",M1

Sixteen patients with lung tumors who were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy were enrolled. A machine vision system with a charge-coupled device camera was used for monitoring <e>respiration</e>. A monocular head-mounted display was used to provide the patient with visual feedback about the breathing trace. The patients could control their breathing so that the breathing waveform would fall between the upper and lower threshold lines. Planning and treatment were performed under visual feedback-guided expiratory breath-hold. Electronic portal images were obtained during treatment. The range of cranial-caudal motion of the tumor location during each single breath-hold was calculated as the intra-breath-hold (intra-BH) variability. The maximum displacement between the two to five averaged tumor locations of each single breath-hold was calculated as the inter-breath-hold (inter-BH) variability. All 16 patients tolerated the visual feedback-guided breath-hold maneuvers well. The intra- and inter-BH variability of all patients was 1.5 +/- 0.6 mm and 1.2 +/- 0.5 mm, respectively. A visual feedback-guided breath-hold technique using the machine vision system is feasible with good breath-hold reproducibility.",M1
19897819,"A MATLAB toolbox for correcting within-individual effects of <e>respiration</e> rate and tidal volume on respiratory sinus arrhythmia during variable breathing.Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a common estimator of vagal outflow to the heart, dependent on parasympathetic activity. During variable breathing, both respiration rate and tidal volume contribute substantially to within-individual RSA variance. A respiratory control method allows for within-individual correction of the time-domain index of RSA. rsaToolbox is a set of MATLAB programs for scoring respiration-corrected RSA using measurements of cardiac interbeat intervals, respiratory-cycle times, and tidal volumes, recorded at different paced-breathing frequencies. The within-individual regression of RSA divided by tidal volume upon total respiratory cycle time is then used to estimate the baseline vagal tone for each breath of a given total respiratory-cycle time. During a subsequent analysis, the difference between the observed RSA (divided by the tidal volume at each breath) and the RSA divided by the tidal volume that was predicted by the baseline equation serves as an estimate of changes in vagal tone. rsaToolbox includes a graphical user interface for intuitive handling. Modular implementation of the algorithm also allows for flexible integration within other analytic strategies or for batch processing.",M1
19889849,"Intrinsic functional connectivity as a tool for human connectomics: theory, properties, and optimization.Resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) is widely used to investigate brain networks that exhibit correlated fluctuations. While fcMRI does not provide direct measurement of anatomic connectivity, accumulating evidence suggests it is sufficiently constrained by anatomy to allow the architecture of distinct brain systems to be characterized. fcMRI is particularly useful for characterizing large-scale systems that span distributed areas (e.g., polysynaptic cortical pathways, cerebro-cerebellar circuits, cortical-thalamic circuits) and has complementary strengths when contrasted with the other major tool available for human connectomics-high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We review what is known about fcMRI and then explore fcMRI data reliability, effects of preprocessing, analysis procedures, and effects of different acquisition parameters across six studies (n = 98) to provide recommendations for optimization. Run length (2-12 min), run structure (1 12-min run or 2 6-min runs), temporal resolution (2.5 or 5.0 s), spatial resolution (2 or 3 mm), and the task (fixation, eyes closed rest, eyes open rest, continuous word-classification) were varied. Results revealed moderate to high test-retest reliability. Run structure, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution minimally influenced fcMRI results while fixation and eyes open rest yielded stronger correlations as contrasted to other task conditions. Commonly used preprocessing steps involving regression of nuisance signals minimized nonspecific (noise) correlations including those associated with <e>respiration</e>. The most surprising finding was that estimates of correlation strengths stabilized with acquisition times as brief as 5 min. The brevity and robustness of fcMRI positions it as a powerful tool for large-scale explorations of genetic influences on brain architecture. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of fcMRI and how it can be combined with HARDI techniques to support the emerging field of human connectomics.",M1

19864705,"REM sleep estimation only using respiratory dynamics.Polysomnography (PSG) is currently considered the gold standard for assessing sleep quality. However, the numerous sensors that must be attached to the subject can disturb sleep and limit monitoring to within hospitals and sleep clinics. If data could be obtained without such constraints, sleep monitoring would be more convenient and could be extended to ordinary homes. During rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, <e>respiration</e> rate and variability are known to be greater than in other sleep stages. Hence, we calculated the average rate and variability of respiration in an epoch (30 s) by applying appropriate smoothing algorithms. Increased and irregular respiratory patterns during REM sleep were extracted using adaptive and linear thresholds. When both parameters simultaneously showed higher values than the thresholds, the epochs were assumed to belong to REM sleep. Thermocouples and piezoelectric-type belts were used to acquire respiratory signals. Thirteen healthy adults and nine obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients participated in this study. Kappa statistics showed a substantial agreement (kappa &gt; 0.60) between the standard and respiration-based methods. One-way ANOVA analysis showed no significant difference between the techniques for total REM sleep. This approach can also be applied to the non-intrusive measurement of respiration signals, making it possible to automatically detect REM sleep without disturbing the subject.",M1
19835835,"Impact of mitochondriotropic quercetin derivatives on mitochondria.Mitochondria-targeted polyphenols are being developed with the intent to intervene on the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. Polyphenols being more than just anti-oxidants, the interaction of these derivatives with the organelles needs to be characterised. We have studied the effects of two quercetin derivatives, 3-(4-O-triphenylphosphoniumbutyl)quercetin iodide (Q3BTPI) and its tetracetylated analogue (QTA3BTPI), on the inner membrane aspecific permeability, transmembrane voltage difference and <e>respiration</e> of isolated rat liver mitochondria. While the effects of low concentrations were too small to be reliably defined, when used in the 5-20 microM range these compounds acted as inducers of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), an effect due to pro-oxidant activity. Furthermore, Q3BTPI behaved as an uncoupler of isolated mitochondria, causing depolarisation and stimulating oxygen consumption. When applied to tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM)-loaded HepG2 or Jurkat cells uptake of the compounds was predictably associated with a loss of TMRM fluorescence, but there was no indication of MPT induction. A production of superoxide could be detected in some cells upon prolonged incubation of MitoSOX-loaded cells with QTA3BTPI. The overall effects of these model mitochondriotropic polyphenols may thus differ considerably depending on whether their hydroxyls are protected or not and on the experimental system. In vivo assays will be needed for a definitive assessment of their bioactivities.",M1

METHODS: One hundred and twenty cases were randomly divided into two groups. The acupuncture group (60 cases) was treated with acupuncture at Zhong wan (CV 12) and Si-guan points [Taichong (LR 3) and Hegu (LI 4)] selected as main acupoints, combined with Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), etc. , meanwhile, the reinforcing-reducing manipulation of respiration was adopted. The western medicine group (60 cases) was treated with oral administration of Fluoxetine Hydrochloride at the dosage of 20 mg every day. These treatments lasted for 8 weeks in both groups. The depression severities were assessed with Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) before treatment and at the 8th week of the treatment and adverse reactions were appraised respectively with Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS). RESULTS: The total effective rate was 95.0% in the acupuncture group and 91.7% in the western medicine group with no significant difference between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). After treatment, the HAMD score had very significant changes in the two groups as compared with those before treatment (both P &lt; 0.01), but there was no significant difference between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). After treatment, there was a significant difference between two groups in TESS score (P &lt; 0.01). There was almost no adverse reaction in the acupuncture group, while the main clinical manifestations in the western medicine group were nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, etc. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture at Zhongwan (CV 12) and Si-guan points combined with reinforcing-reducing manipulation of respiration can significantly improve symptoms of depression patients with a similar therapeutic effect to oral administration of Fluoxetine Hydrochloride and it is a safe method for depression without adverse reactions.",M1
19828895,"Regulation of trigeminal respiratory motor activity in the brainstem.The trigeminal motor system participates in the control of <e>respiration</e> as well as suckling and mastication. However, the central mechanism underlying respiratory activity in trigeminal motoneurons is not well-understood. In this study, we aimed to elucidate brainstem circuitry for rhythm generation and signal transmission of trigeminal respiratory activity in in vitro neonatal rat brainstem-spinal cord preparations. We further examined the role of midline-crossing trigeminal interneurons in the bilateral synchronization of respiratory and suckling activity in trigeminal motor nerves. The results of brainstem-sectioning experiments indicated that respiratory rhythms were generated in the medulla and ipsilaterally transmitted to trigeminal motoneurons in the pons. We conclude that the trigeminal motor system, as well as the hypoglossal and phrenic motor system, is regulated by medullary respiratory networks, and that pontine interactions between bilateral trigeminal interneurons are not critical for the generation or synchronization of trigeminal respiratory activity, but are crucial for trigeminal suckling activity.",M1
19818418,"Role of cholinergic-nicotinic receptors on hypoxic chemoreflex during postnatal development in rats.We tested the hypothesis that the function of cholinergic-nicotinic receptors on <e>respiration</e> is age dependent. To this end, we used whole body plethysmography to measure breathing frequency (fR), tidal volume (V(T)) and minute ventilation (V (E)) under normoxia (21% O(2)) in rats at 1, 4, 7, 12 and 21 postnatal days before and after administration of epibatidine (nicotinic agonist 5 microg/kg, i.p.). In normoxia, epibatidine increased fR and V (E) in a proportionally age-dependent manner (p for age &lt;0.001), without affecting V(T). We then focused on P4 and P12 rats, as representative of this developmental pattern, to measure ventilatory response to moderate hypoxia (12% O(2), 20 min) after i.p. injection of saline (control), epibatidine (5 microg/kg), or (nicotinic antagonist, 1mg/kg). At these doses, both drugs selectively target peripheral nicotinic receptors. Epibatidine enhanced the hypoxic ventilatory response while hexamethonium significantly reduced it. These effects were significantly greater in P12 than in P4 rats (p for age &lt;0.001). In P12 rats, in vitro recordings of carotid sinus nerve activity showed that superfusion with nicotine enhanced chemosensory discharge rate in normoxia and hexamethonium reduced the discharge rate in hypoxia. We also identified the nicotinic receptor alpha7 subunit by immunohistochemistry in carotid bodies from P12 rat. These data show that the role of cholinergic-nicotinic receptor on hypoxic chemoreflex is age dependent and this effect likely implicates carotid body nicotinic receptor activation.",M1
19808336,"Novel use of cardiac pacemakers in heart failure to dynamically manipulate the respiratory system through algorithmic changes in cardiac output.BACKGROUND: Alternation of heart rate between 2 values using a pacemaker generates oscillations in end-tidal CO(2) (et-CO(2)). This study examined (a) whether modulating atrioventricular delay can also do this, and (b) whether more gradual variation of cardiac output can achieve comparable changes in et-CO(2) with less-sudden changes in blood pressure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We applied pacemaker fluctuations by adjusting heart rate (by 30 bpm) or atrioventricular delay (between optimal and nonoptimal values) or both, with period of 60 s in 19 heart failure patients (age 73+/-11, EF 29+/-12%). The changes in cardiac output, by either heart rate or atrioventricular delay or both, were made either as a step ( square wave ) or more gradually ( sine wave ). We obtained changes in cardiac output sufficient to engender comparable oscillations in et-CO(2) (P=NS) in all 19 patients either by manipulation of heart rate (14), or by atrioventricular delay (2) or both (3). The square wave produced 191% larger and 250% more sudden changes in blood pressure than the sine wave alternations (22.4+/-11.7 versus 13.6+/-4.5 mm Hg, P&lt;0.01 and 19.8+/-10.0 versus 7.9+/-3.2 mm Hg over 5 s, P&lt;0.01), but peak-to-trough et-CO(2) elicited was only 45% higher (0.45+/-0.18 versus 0.31+/-0.13 kPa, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that cardiac output is the key to dynamically manipulating the respiratory system with pacing sequences. When manipulating <e>respiration</e> by this route, a sine wave pattern may be preferable to a square wave, because it minimizes sudden blood pressure fluctuations.",M1
19799503,"Escaping to the surface: a phylogenetically independent analysis of hypoxia-induced respiratory behaviors in sculpins.Behavioral responses to progressive hypoxia exposure were assessed in several species of fish from the family Cottidae (sculpins), which are distributed along the near-shore marine environment and differ in their hypoxia tolerance. The use of aquatic surface <e>respiration</e> (ASR) and aerial emergence as a response to progressive decreases in environmental O(2) differed between intertidal and subtidal sculpins. Intertidal sculpins consistently displayed ASR followed by emergence behaviors, while the subtidal species performed these behaviors at low frequency or not at all. There was a significant negative correlation between the O(2) thresholds for the onset of ASR and critical O(2) tensions (P(crit), a measure of hypoxia tolerance), such that the hypoxia-tolerant species performed ASR at higher O(2) tensions than the more hypoxia-sensitive species. There was no relationship between the O(2) thresholds for emergence and P(crit). When restricted from accessing the water surface during progressive decreases in O(2), all species of sculpin displayed the same sequence of behaviors including agitation, attempts to escape, quiescence, and unresponsiveness. The only behavior from this suite that correlated with P(crit) was the first sign of agitation, which occurred at a lower O(2) tension in the most hypoxia-tolerant species. With the application of phylogenetically independent contrasts, all the relationships between behavior and P(crit) were nonsignificant, which limits our capacity to separate selection-driven changes in behavior from the phylogenetic signal.",M1

19789099,"The role of cardiopulmonary signals in the dynamics of the eye's wavefront aberrations.The role of cardiopulmonary signals in the dynamics of wavefront aberrations in the eye has been examined. Synchronous measurement of the eye's wavefront aberrations, cardiac function, blood pulse, and <e>respiration</e> signals were taken for a group of young, healthy subjects. Two focusing stimuli, three breathing patterns, as well as natural and cycloplegic eye conditions were examined. A set of tools, including time-frequency coherence and its metrics, has been proposed to acquire a detailed picture of the interactions of the cardiopulmonary system with the eye's wavefront aberrations. The results showed that the coherence of the blood pulse and its harmonics with the eye's aberrations was, on average, weak ( 0.4+/-0.15), while the coherence of the respiration signal with eye's aberrations was, on average, moderate ( 0.53+/-0.14). It was also revealed that there were significant intervals during which high coherence occurred. On average, the coherence was high ( &gt; 0.75) during 16% of the recorded time, for the blood pulse, and 34% of the time for the respiration signal. A statistically significant decrease in average coherence was noted for the eye's aberrations with respiration in the case of fast controlled breathing (0.5 Hz). The coherence between the blood pulse and the defocus was significantly larger for the far target than for the near target condition. After cycloplegia, the coherence of defocus with the blood pulse significantly decreased, while this was not the case for the other aberrations. There was also a noticeable, but not statistically significant, increase in the coherence of the comatic term and respiration in that case. By using nonstationary measures of signal coherence, a more detailed picture of interactions between the cardiopulmonary signals and eye's wavefront aberrations has emerged.",M1

Part I: diagnosis, definitions, prevalence, pathophysiology and haemodynamic consequences.Sleep disorder specialists manage 90% of patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnoea, which affects 10% of the general population. From another perspective, cardiovascular disease specialists are particularly challenged by sleep apnoea, since it affects a large proportion of their patients and its complications are largely cardiovascular. At least 50% of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) suffer from sleep apnoea, predominantly central and/or Cheyne-Stokes <e>respiration</e> as opposed to obstructive sleep apnoea.

19776654,"Cardiac autonomic regulation under hypnosis assessed by heart rate variability: spectral analysis and fractal complexity.OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of hypnosis on autonomic cardiac control. We hypothesized a modification of autonomic modulation of the heart rate with an enhanced vagal tone during hypnosis compared to baseline. METHODS: In 12 healthy subjects (6 men and 6 women, 22.2 +/- 1.0 years of age) ECG was recorded at baseline and during hypnosis. Heart rate variability parameters were obtained in the frequency domain (LFnu: low frequency normalized units, and HFnu: high frequency normalized units) and from nonlinear analysis methods (detrended fluctuation analysis, DFA). RESULTS: Compared to the control condition, hypnosis showed a significantly decreased LFnu, a significantly increased HFnu, and a significantly decreased LF/HF. DFA showed a significantly decreased short-range similarity. Heart rate remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: Autonomic cardiac tone is significantly modified during hypnosis by shifting the balance of the sympathovagal interaction toward an enhanced parasympathetic modulation, accompanied by a reduction of the sympathetic tone and a decreased short-range similarity but without a concomitant change in heart rate. Central and secondary autonomous nervous system changes induced by hypnosis are a possible explanation for our results. Another highly probable explanation is given by a variation in the depth of <e>respiration</e>. Hypnosis appears to prevent the autonomic responses expected during neutral stimulation.",M1
19761924,"The effect of maxillary multidirectional movement on nasal <e>respiration</e>.PURPOSE: Deformities of the maxilla may exist on all planes, and we treat these problems by mobilizing and repositioning the maxilla on all planes. Some authors have examined the effects of maxillary movement on the nasal airway. In clinical, practice, active anterior rhinomanometry is the most reliable and frequently used method to assess nasal respiratory function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in nasal airflow and nasal airway resistance after maxillary movement performed by active anterior rhinomanometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 25 patients (18 female patients and 7 male patients; aged 16-30 years) in this clinical trial. Three days before surgery and 6 months after surgery, after a rest period of 30 minutes, active anterior rhinomanometry with a tube was performed at a fixed transnasal pressure of 150 Pa. The surgical treatment plan included bimaxillary surgery consisting of a 1-piece Le Fort I osteotomy combined with a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy. Mean and median total nasal airflow and nasal resistance rate were calculated before surgery and after surgery and compared by use of SPSS software (version 11.5; SPSS, Chicago, IL) and paired t test. RESULTS: An increase in nasal airflow (P = .009) and a decrease in nasal resistance (P = .022) were observed in the maxillary impaction and advancement group. In the maxillary impaction and setback group, there was a significant difference in nasal resistance changes (P = .027); however, postsurgical nasal airflow compared with presurgical values showed no statistically significant difference (P = .244). CONCLUSION: Impaction and advancement of the maxilla can improve nasal respiratory function, but maxillary impaction and setback reduce nasal respiratory function. Hence candidates for maxillary impaction and setback must be informed about decreased nasal respiratory function.",M1
19758577,"The absorption efficiency and <e>respiration</e> rate of the Florida lancelet, Branchiostoma floridae.The present study investigates some aspects of the digestive biology and physiological energetics of the Florida lancelet, Branchiostoma floridae. Florida lancelets are able to remove 47.2-56.9% of the energy from a diet of mixed algae. The respiration rate is 0.100mL O(2) (STPD) h(-1) g(-1) (wet), which estimates a metabolic rate of 0.248 J h(-1), at an average body mass of 0.125 g (wet). Published values of the chlorophyll a concentration in its natural habitat indicate that a 125 mg lancelet would need to filter 0.018-0.031 L h(-1) to remove sufficient food to support its resting metabolism. The filtration rate of lancelets has been reported as 0.138 L h(-1), indicating that the actual filtration rate is 4-7 times greater than the filtration rate needed to meet resting metabolic demands. It appears that lancelets have the potential to be raised in aquaculture, because their absorption efficiency and respiration rate are comparable to suspension-feeding invertebrates that have been successfully aquacultured.",M1
19737858,"Respiratory pathophysiology of panic disorder: an ambulatory monitoring study.OBJECTIVE: To assess the external validity of laboratory baselines in panic disorder (PD), frequently associated with respiratory pattern abnormalities like increased respiratory variability and sighing, implying a stable pathophysiologic trait characteristic. METHODS: Physical activity and a variety of breath-by-breath volumetric, timing, and variability measures of <e>respiration</e> were recorded in the daily life of 26 patients with PD and 26 healthy controls (HC), using a novel ambulatory monitoring system optimized for reliable assessment of respiratory pattern. Data were stratified for physical activity to eliminate its confounding effects. RESULTS: Groups showed strong and consistent diurnal patterns in almost all respiratory variables. However, patients with PD did not differ from HC regarding any of the respiratory timing, volumetric and variability measures, with negligible group effect sizes for all measures. Patients with fewer self-reported respiratory symptoms of anxiety exhibited more pronounced rapid shallow breathing as well as diminished total breath time and its variability. CONCLUSIONS: Despite state-of-the-art ambulatory assessment and sufficient statistical power to detect respiratory alterations previously observed in the laboratory, we found no evidence for such alterations in PD patients' daily life. Neither the total PD group nor patients with particularly pronounced respiratory symptomatology displayed increased respiratory variability. These results caution against interpreting results from laboratory baselines in PD as reflecting a stable trait characteristic. Rather, they likely represent a state-trait interaction due to enhanced reactivity of PD patients to novel environments. These results challenge aspects of respiratory theories of PD that were based on laboratory findings.",M1
19735882,"Residual motion and duty time in respiratory gating radiotherapy using individualized or population-based windows.PURPOSE: The efficiency and precision of respiratory gated radiation therapy for tumors is affected by variations in <e>respiration</e>-induced tumor motion. We evaluated the use of individualized and population-based parameters for such treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: External respiratory signal records and images of respiration-induced tumor motion were obtained from 42 patients undergoing respiratory gated radiation therapy for liver tumors. Gating window widths were calculated for each patient, with 2, 4, and 10 mm of residual motion, and the mean was defined as the population-based window width. Residual motions based on population-based and predefined window widths were compared. Duty times based on whole treatment sessions, at various window levels, were calculated. The window level giving the longest duty time was defined as the individualized most efficient level (MEL). MELs were also calculated based on the first 10 breathing cycles. The duty times for population-based MELs (defined as mean MELs) and individualized MELs were compared. RESULTS: Tracks of respiration-induced tumor motion ranged from 3 to 50 mm. Half of the patients had larger actual residual motions than the assigned residual motions. Duty times were greater when based on individualized, rather than population-based, window widths. The MELs established during whole treatment sessions for 2 mm and 4 mm of residual motion gave significantly increased duty times, whereas those calculated using the first 10 breathing cycles showed only marginal increases. CONCLUSIONS: Using individualized window widths and levels provided more precise and efficient respiratory gated radiation therapy. However, methods for predicting individualized window levels before treatment remain to be explored.",M1
19733469,"Respiratory movement of upper abdominal organs and its effect on radiotherapy planning in pancreatic cancer.AIMS: Radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer is complicated by the frequent overlapping of the planning target volume (PTV) and the organ at risk (OAR), limiting the dose that can be safely delivered to the tumour. Individualising the margins applied to the clinical target volume (CTV) may reduce OAR irradiation without increasing the risk of geographical miss. We quantified the movement of the pancreas with <e>respiration</e> and evaluated whether individualised margins based on this motion reduced the dose to OARs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Planning computed tomography scans were acquired in quiet breathing, held expiration and held inspiration. Organ motion was evaluated from displacement of a reproducible point within the pancreas in all directions. Two sets of plans (standard plan: P(stan); individualised plan incorporating movement data: P(ind)) were generated for each patient. The PTV and doses to OARs were evaluated for both sets of plans. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) movement of the pancreas in the superior-inferior, lateral and anterior-posterior directions were 15.3 mm (4.3), 5.2 mm (3.5) and 9.7 mm (6.1), respectively. The use of individualised margins reduced the mean PTV volume by 33.5% (9.8) (P=0.0051). The proportional reductions in the percentage of kidney receiving &gt;10 Gy, small bowel &gt;45 Gy and liver &gt;30 Gy were 63.7% (P=0.0051), 29.3% (P=0.0125) and 29.2% (P=0.0107), respectively. For the same level of OAR constraints, individualised margins allowed dose escalation in six of the 10 patients to a mean dose of 63.2 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows a simple way of incorporating organ motion into the planning process and can be adopted by any centre without major strain on healthcare resources. The use of individualised margins reduced PTV volume and the dose to OARs. This may offer an opportunity for dose escalation to try and further improve local control.",M1
19729080,"Sleep disordered breathing following spinal cord injury.Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) commonly complain about difficulty in sleeping. Although various sleep disordered breathing definitions and indices are used that make comparisons between studies difficult, it seems evident that the frequency of sleep disorders is higher in individuals with SCI, especially with regard to obstructive sleep apnea. In addition, there is a correlation between the incidence of sleep disturbances and the spinal cord level injured, age, body mass index, neck circumference, abdominal girth, and use of sedating medications. Regulation of <e>respiration</e> is dependent on wakefulness and sleep. Thus, it is important to be aware of basic mechanisms in the regulation and control of sleep and awake states. Supine position decreases the vital capacity in tetraplegic individuals, and diminished responsiveness to Pa(CO)(2) may further decrease ventilatory reserve. There also may be a potential disparity between daytime and nocturnal ventilation, as individuals with partially reduced muscle tone are susceptible to not only sleep apnea, but also sleep-related hypoventilation which may be aggravated during rapid eye movement sleep.",M1

19717678,"Endothermy of dynastine scarab beetles (Cyclocephala colasi) associated with pollination biology of a thermogenic arum lily (Philodendron solimoesense).Cyclocephala colasi beetles are facultative endotherms that spend most of their adult lives inside the inflorescences of Philodendron solimoesense, where ambient temperature (T(a)) averages about 28 degrees C due to floral thermogenesis. Measurements of <e>respiration</e> within a range of T(a) showed that active beetles became spontaneously endothermic at T(a) below 28 degrees C but were rarely endothermic above it. There was no evidence of endothermy within the inflorescences, indicating that activities in the floral chamber can occur without the high energy expense of endothermy. Bouts of endothermy occurred at lower T(a) in respirometer chambers mainly in the evening, when the insects normally fly from one inflorescence to another, and during the night, when they normally eat and mate within the inflorescence. Patterns of endothermy in individual episodes were studied in non-flying beetles with respirometry and infrared thermal imaging. Heat was generated in the thorax by oscillatory waves of respiration that were coupled with thoracic temperature (T(th)) increases. Stationary beetles could regulate T(th) at about 33 degrees C independently of T(a) between 16 and 29 degrees C. At T(a)=20 degrees C, this represents a 116-fold increase in metabolic rate over resting, ectothermic values. Endothermy was clearly a requirement for flight, and beetles departing inflorescences warmed to about 30 degrees C before take-off. During flight, T(th) was dependent on T(a), decreasing from 37 to 28 degrees C at T(a) of 37 to 20 degrees C, respectively. The lowest T(a) at which flight could occur was about 20 degrees C. Thermal conductance of stationary, endothermic beetles increased at higher metabolic rates, probably because of increased ventilatory heat loss.",M1
19714303,"Effect of breathing motion in radiotherapy of breast cancer: 4D dose calculation and motion tracking via EPID.PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of breathing motion in postoperative whole-breast radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For ten patients with left-sided breast cancer, radiotherapy treatment plans were generated based on conventional three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) studies: two techniques (segmented and wedge-based tangential fields) were compared. The influence of breathing motion on the dose to the target and organs at risk (OARs) was evaluated with four-dimensional (4D) dose calculation based on <e>respiration</e>-correlated CTs. Reproducibility of breathing motion was evaluated with electronic portal images (EPID) acquired in cine mode during treatment. RESULTS: Differences in dose distributions were small between segmented and wedge techniques based on 3D studies. Because of small motion amplitude of the chest in the 4D CT studies (1.8 mm +/- 0.9 mm), target coverage was reduced by &lt; 5% due to breathing motion. Differences between 3D and 4D dose calculation were similar for segmented and wedge techniques. Blurring of the dose distribution in 4D dose calculation resulted in lower doses to the OARs. Analysis of EPID movies proved good reproducibility of breathing motion observed in the 4D CT study. CONCLUSION: Breathing motion was of minor relevance in postoperative radiotherapy treatment of breast cancer for both segmented and wedge tangential field techniques.",M1
19712905,"PHOX2B in respiratory control: lessons from congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and its mouse models.Phox2b is a master regulator of visceral reflex circuits. Its role in the control of <e>respiration</e> has been highlighted by the identification of heterozygous PHOX2B mutations as the cause of Central Congenital Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS), a rare disease defined by the lack of CO(2) responsiveness and of breathing automaticity in sleep. Phox2b(27Ala/+) mice that bear a frequent CCHS-causing mutation do not respond to hypercapnia and die in the first hour after birth from central apnoea. They are therefore a reliable animal model for CCHS. Neurons of the retrotrapezoïd nucleus/parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG) were found severely depleted in these mice and no other neuronal loss could be identified. Physiological experiments show that RTN/pFRG neurons are crucial to driving proper breathing at birth and are necessary for central chemoreception and the generation of a normal respiratory rhythm. To date, the reason for the selective vulnerability of RTN/pFRG neurons to PHOX2B protein dysfunction remains unexplained.",M1
19656411,"Using a human cardiovascular-respiratory model to characterize cardiac tamponade and pulsus paradoxus.BACKGROUND: Cardiac tamponade is a condition whereby fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart causes elevation and equilibration of pericardial and cardiac chamber pressures, reduced cardiac output, changes in hemodynamics, partial chamber collapse, pulsus paradoxus, and arterio-venous acid-base disparity. Our large-scale model of the human cardiovascular-respiratory system (H-CRS) is employed to study mechanisms underlying cardiac tamponade and pulsus paradoxus. The model integrates hemodynamics, whole-body gas exchange, and autonomic nervous system control to simulate pressure, volume, and blood flow. METHODS: We integrate a new pericardial model into our previously developed H-CRS model based on a fit to patient pressure data. Virtual experiments are designed to simulate pericardial effusion and study mechanisms of pulsus paradoxus, focusing particularly on the role of the interventricular septum. Model differential equations programmed in C are solved using a 5th-order Runge-Kutta numerical integration scheme. MATLAB is employed for waveform analysis. RESULTS: The H-CRS model simulates hemodynamic and respiratory changes associated with tamponade clinically. Our model predicts effects of effusion-generated pericardial constraint on chamber and septal mechanics, such as altered right atrial filling, delayed leftward septal motion, and prolonged left ventricular pre-ejection period, causing atrioventricular interaction and ventricular desynchronization. We demonstrate pericardial constraint to markedly accentuate normal ventricular interactions associated with respiratory effort, which we show to be the distinct mechanisms of pulsus paradoxus, namely, series and parallel ventricular interaction. Series ventricular interaction represents respiratory variation in right ventricular stroke volume carried over to the left ventricle via the pulmonary vasculature, whereas parallel interaction (via the septum and pericardium) is a result of competition for fixed filling space. We find that simulating active septal contraction is important in modeling ventricular interaction. The model predicts increased arterio-venous CO2 due to hypoperfusion, and we explore implications of respiratory pattern in tamponade. CONCLUSION: Our modeling study of cardiac tamponade dissects the roles played by septal motion, atrioventricular and right-left ventricular interactions, pulmonary blood pooling, and the depth of <e>respiration</e>. The study fully describes the physiological basis of pulsus paradoxus. Our detailed analysis provides biophysically-based insights helpful for future experimental and clinical study of cardiac tamponade and related pericardial diseases.",M1
19651244,"Recovery of respiratory activity after C2 hemisection (C2HS): involvement of adenosinergic mechanisms.Consequences of spinal cord injury (SCI) depend on the level and extent of injury. Cervical SCI often results in a compromised respiratory system. Primary treatment of SCI patients with respiratory insufficiency continues to be with mechanical ventilatory support. In an animal model of SCI, an upper cervical spinal cord hemisection paralyzes the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the side of injury. However, a latent respiratory motor pathway can be activated to restore respiratory function after injury. In this review, restoration of respiratory activity following systemic administration of theophylline, a respiratory stimulant will be discussed. Pharmacologically, theophylline is a non-specific adenosine receptor antagonist, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and a bronchodilator. It has been used in the treatment of asthma and other respiratory-related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in treatment of apnea in premature infants. However, the clinical use of theophylline to improve <e>respiration</e> in SCI patients with respiratory deficits is a more recent approach. This review will focus on the use of theophylline to restore respiratory activity in an animal model of SCI. In this model, a C2 hemisection (C2HS) interrupts the major descending respiratory pathways and paralyzes the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. The review also highlights involvement of central and peripheral adenosine receptors in functional restitution. Biochemical binding assays that highlight changes in adenosine receptors after chronic theophylline administration are discussed as they pertain to understanding adenosine receptor-mediation in functional recovery. Finally, the clinical application of theophylline in SCI patients with respiratory deficits in particular is discussed.",M1
19648386,"Validity of the FOUR score coma scale in the medical intensive care unit.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of the FOUR (Full Outline of UnResponsiveness) score (ranging from 0 to 16), a new coma scale consisting of 4 components (eye response, motor response, brainstem reflexes, and <e>respiration</e> pattern), when used by the staff members of a medical intensive care unit (ICU). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This interobserver agreement study prospectively evaluated the use of the FOUR score to describe the condition of 100 critically ill patients from May 1, 2007, to April 30, 2008. We compared the FOUR score to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. For each patient, the FOUR score and the GCS score were determined by a randomly selected staff pair (nurse/fellow, nurse/consultant, fellow/fellow, or fellow/consultant). Pair wise weighted kappa values were calculated for both scores for each observer pair. RESULTS: The interrater agreement with the FOUR score was excellent (weighted kappa: eye response, 0.96; motor response, 0.97; brainstem reflex, 0.98; respiration pattern, 1.00) and similar to that obtained with the GCS (weighted kappa: eye response, 0.96; motor response, 0.97; verbal response, 0.98). In terms of the predictive power for poor neurologic outcome (Modified Rankin Scale score, 3-6), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.75 for the FOUR score and 0.76 for the GCS score. The mortality rate for patients with the lowest FOUR score of 0 (89%) was higher than that for patients with the lowest GCS score of 3 (71%). CONCLUSION: The interrater agreement of FOUR score results was excellent among medical intensivists. In contrast to the GCS, all components of the FOUR score can be rated even when patients have undergone intubation. The FOUR score is a good predictor of the prognosis of critically ill patients and has important advantages over the GCS in the ICU setting.",M1
19639756,"Model-based assessment of cardiovascular autonomic control in children with obstructive sleep apnea.STUDY OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively assess daytime autonomic cardiovascular control in pediatric subjects with and without obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). DESIGN: <e>Respiration</e>, R-R intervals, and noninvasive continuous blood pressure were monitored in awake subjects in the supine and standing postures, as well as during cold face stimulation. SETTING: Sleep disorders laboratory in a hospital setting. PARTICIPANTS: Ten pediatric patients (age 11.4 +/- 3.6 years) with moderate to severe OSAS (obstructive apnea-hypopnea index = 21.0 +/- 6.6/1 h) before treatment and 10 age-matched normal control subjects (age 11.5 +/- 3.7 years). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Spectral analysis of heart rate variability revealed that high-frequency power was similar and the ratio of low- to high-frequency power was lower in subjects with OSAS vs control subjects. The closed-loop minimal model allowed heart rate variability to be partitioned into a component mediated by respiratory-cardiac coupling and a baroreflex component, whereas blood pressure variability was assumed to result from the direct effects of respiration and fluctuations in cardiac output. Baroreflex gain was lower in subjects with OSAS vs control subjects. Under orthostatic stress, respiratory-cardiac coupling gain decreased in both subject groups, but baroreflex gain decreased only in controls. The model was extended to incorporate time-varying parameter changes for analysis of the data collected during cold face stimulation: cardiac output gain increased in controls but remained unchanged in OSAS. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that vagal modulation of the heart remains relatively normal in pediatric subjects with OSAS. However, baseline cardiovascular sympathetic activity is elevated, and reactivity to autonomic challenges is impaired.",M1
19639752,"Prevalent hypertension and stroke in the Sleep Heart Health Study: association with an ECG-derived spectrographic marker of cardiopulmonary coupling.STUDY OBJECTIVES: The electrocardiogram (ECG)-based sleep spectrogram generates a map of cardiopulmonary coupling based on heart rate variability and <e>respiration</e> derived from QRS amplitude variations. A distinct spectrographic phenotype, designated as narrow-band elevated low frequency coupling (e-LFC(NB)), has been associated with central apneas and periodic breathing and predicts sleep laboratory failure of continuous positive airway pressure therapy. This study assesses, at a population level, the associations of this spectrographic biomarker with prevalent cardiovascular disease using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)-I dataset. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the Sleep Heart Health Study-I dataset. SETTING: Laboratory for complex physiologic signals analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The fully-automated ECG-derived sleep spectrogram technique was applied to 5247 (of the original 6441) polysomnograms from the SHHS-I. Associations were estimated with use of various drugs and pathologies including prevalent hypertension and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Increasing with age and more common in males, e-LFC(NB) is also associated with greater severity of sleep apnea and fragmented sleep. After adjustment for potential confounders, an independent association with prevalent hypertension and stroke was found. CONCLUSIONS: An ECG-derived spectrographic marker related to low frequency cardiopulmonary coupling is associated with greater sleep apnea severity. Whether this biomarker is solely a sign of more severe disease or whether it reflects primary alterations in sleep apnea pathophysiology (which may either cause or result from sleep apnea) is unknown. This ECG-based spectral marker is associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension and stroke.",M1
19628721,"Dynamic CO2 therapy in periodic breathing: a modeling study to determine optimal timing and dosage regimes.We examine the potential to treat unstable ventilatory control (seen in periodic breathing, Cheyne-Stokes <e>respiration</e>, and central sleep apnea) with carefully controlled dynamic administration of supplementary CO(2), aiming to reduce ventilatory oscillations with minimum increment in mean CO(2). We used a standard mathematical model to explore the consequences of phasic CO(2) administration, with different timing and dosing algorithms. We found an optimal time window within the ventilation cycle (covering approximately 1/6 of the cycle) during which CO(2) delivery reduces ventilatory fluctuations by &gt;95%. Outside that time, therapy is dramatically less effective: indeed, for more than two-thirds of the cycle, therapy increases ventilatory fluctuations &gt;30%. Efficiency of stabilizing ventilation improved when the algorithm gave a graded increase in CO(2) dose (by controlling its duration or concentration) for more severe periodic breathing. Combining gradations of duration and concentration further increased efficiency of therapy by 22%. The (undesirable) increment in mean end-tidal CO(2) caused was 300 times smaller with dynamic therapy than with static therapy, to achieve the same degree of ventilatory stabilization (0.0005 vs. 0.1710 kPa). The increase in average ventilation was also much smaller with dynamic than static therapy (0.005 vs. 2.015 l/min). We conclude that, if administered dynamically, dramatically smaller quantities of CO(2) could be used to reduce periodic breathing, with minimal adverse effects. Algorithms adjusting both duration and concentration in real time would achieve this most efficiently. If developed clinically as a therapy for periodic breathing, this would minimize excess acidosis, hyperventilation, and sympathetic overactivation, compared with static treatment.",M1
19628342,"Inter- and intrafraction variability in liver position in non-breath-hold stereotactic body radiotherapy.PURPOSE: The inter- and intrafraction variability of liver position was assessed in patients with liver cancer treated with kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 314 CBCT scans obtained in the treatment position immediately before and after each fraction were evaluated from 29 patients undergoing six-fraction, non-breath-hold stereotactic body radiotherapy for unresectable liver cancer. Off-line, the CBCT scans were sorted into 10 bins, according to the phase of <e>respiration</e>. The liver position (relative to the vertebral bodies) was measured using rigid alignment of the exhale CBCT liver with the exhale planning CT liver, following the alignment of the vertebrae. The interfraction liver position change was measured by comparing the pretreatment CBCT scans, and the intrafraction change was measured from the CBCT scans obtained immediately before and after each fraction. RESULTS: The mean amplitude of liver motion for all patients was 1.8 mm (range, 0.1-5.7), 8.0 mm (range, 0.1-18.8), and 4.3 mm (range 0.1-12.1) in the medial-lateral (ML), craniocaudal (CC), and anteroposterior (AP) directions, respectively. The mean absolute ML, CC, and AP interfraction changes in liver position were 2.0 mm (90th percentile, 4.2), 3.5 mm (90th percentile, 7.3), and 2.3 mm (90th percentile, 4.7). The mean absolute intrafraction ML, CC, and AP changes were 1.3 mm (90th percentile, 2.9), 1.6 mm (90th percentile, 3.6), and 1.5 mm (90th percentile, 3.1), respectively. The interfraction changes were significantly larger than the intrafraction changes, with a CC systematic error of 2.9 and 1.1 mm, respectively. The intraobserver reproducibility (sigma, n = 29 fractions) was 1.3 mm in the ML, 1.4 mm in the CC, and 1.6 mm in the AP direction. CONCLUSION: Interfraction liver position changes relative to the vertebral bodies are an important source of geometric uncertainty, providing a rationale for prefraction soft-tissue image guidance. The intrafraction change in liver position from the beginning to the end of each fraction was small for most patients.",M1
19622852,"Real-time profiling of respiratory motion: baseline drift, frequency variation and fundamental pattern change.To precisely ablate tumor in radiation therapy, it is important to locate the tumor position in real time during treatment. However, <e>respiration</e>-induced tumor motions are difficult to track. They are semi-periodic and exhibit variations in baseline, frequency and fundamental pattern (oscillatory amplitude and shape). In this study, we try to decompose the above-mentioned components from discrete observations in real time. Baseline drift, frequency (equivalently phase) variation and fundamental pattern change characterize different aspects of respiratory motion and have distinctive clinical indications. Furthermore, smoothness is a valid assumption for each one of these components in their own spaces, and facilitates effective extrapolation for the purpose of estimation and prediction. We call this process 'profiling' to reflect the integration of information extraction, decomposition, processing and recovery. The proposed method has three major ingredients: (1) real-time baseline and phase estimation based on elliptical shape tracking in augmented state space and Poincaré sectioning principle; (2) estimation of the fundamental pattern by unwarping the observation with phase estimate from the previous step; (3) filtering of individual components and assembly in the original temporal-displacement signal space. We tested the proposed method with both simulated and clinical data. For the purpose of prediction, the results are comparable to what one would expect from a human operator. The proposed approach is fully unsupervised and data driven, making it ideal for applications requiring economy, efficiency and flexibility.",M1
19614871,"Swallowing and respiratory pattern in young healthy individuals recorded with high temporal resolution.The coordination of swallowing and <e>respiration</e> is essential for a safe swallow. Swallowing consists of several subsecond events. To study this, it is important to use modalities with high temporal resolution. In this study, we have examined young healthy individuals with simultaneous videofluoroscopy, videomanometry and respiratory recording, all with high temporal resolution. The onset of 13 predetermined swallowing and respiratory events and the surrounding respiratory phase pattern were studied in different body positions and during different respiratory drives. An increased respiratory drive was induced by breathing 5% CO(2). The results demonstrated a highly repeatable and fixed temporal coordination of the swallowing pattern despite body position and respiratory drive. Previous studies have demonstrated a period of centrally controlled apnoea during swallowing. This apnoea period has a variable length, varying from 1 to 5 s. During increased respiratory drive, we could demonstrate a significantly shorter period of apnoea during swallowing, mainly due to an earlier resumption of respiration. The high temporal recordings in this study have revealed that swallowing during expiration is present basically in all healthy individuals. This swallowing respiratory pattern seems to be appropriate for a safe swallow. This knowledge will be used as a reference for future studies on how swallowing and respiratory coordination might be altered due to ageing and diseases.",M1
19581043,"Tuition of emergency medical dispatchers in the recognition of agonal <e>respiration</e> increases the use of telephone assisted CPR.OBJECTIVES: Bystanders cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) increases survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Emergency medical dispatchers (EMDs) can provide even totally inexperienced bystanders with instructions by telephone on how to resuscitate victims (T-CPR) until the emergency medical services (EMS) arrive. Agonal respiration makes it difficult for EMDs to identify cardiac arrests (CAs) which will prevent or delay initiation of T-CPR. The aim of this investigation was to study if tuition of EMDs can improve their ability to identify agonal respiration in OHCA to allow for more frequent offers of T-CPR. METHODS: An observational study was made in 2004 and subsequently, a repeat study was made in 2006. All OHCA (n=315 in 2004, n=255 in 2006) in the Stockholm region reported to the Swedish Cardiac Arrest Register were included and all corresponding EMS reports were reviewed. Emergency calls were recorded during the event. Witnessed cases of OHCA (n=76 in both 2004 and 2006) were analyzed using a structured data collection tool. RESULTS: The frequency of offered T-CPR to all bystanders of OHCA in 2004 was 47%. After special tuition on agonal respiration in OHCA it rose to 68% in 2006 (p=0.01). An even more marked rise was observed in OHCA cases with agonal respiration. In 2004 T-CPR was offered in 23% of these situations whereas the corresponding figures in 2006 had risen to 56% (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Teaching EMDs to understand and recognize bystander descriptions of agonal respiration in patients with OHCA has resulted in a significant increase in offers of T-CPR in these situations.",M1
19564126,"Energy and protein needs of cats for maintenance, gestation and lactation.In the present investigation, data on the energy intakes and energy needs, as well as protein and fat accretion, of queens during pregnancy, during lactation and after lactation are given. Eleven adult cats were used as experimental animals. Data were collected during the fourth and seventh week of pregnancy, the second and sixth week of lactation and the second and sixth week after lactation. The cats were fed dry kitten food. During gestation and after lactation, all measurements were performed with <e>respiration</e> chambers. During lactation, balance trials without respiration chambers were performed. Body weight was measured and nitrogen, carbon and energy balances were calculated. From these, protein and fat accretion, as well as the metabolisable energy intake, was calculated. The weight gain during gestation was linearly independent of the number of kittens. During lactation, all cats lost weight; nevertheless, all cats except one were heavier 2 weeks after lactation than at mating. The energy intake of the cats during gestation was 1.8 times the maintenance requirement in the fourth week and two times maintenance requirement in the seventh week, and these energy intakes differed greatly among individuals. The energy intake of the cats during lactation was clearly higher than that recommended by National Research Council (NRC)(1), whereas the recommended protein intake in the second week of lactation was met. As the calculated protein balance was negative, the NRC recommendation for protein intake seems to be too low. In comparison to previous data, the cats showed a higher energy intake during lactation (median 502kJ/kgBW/d, second week lactation), and the weight loss was much lower. Further investigations on pregnant and lactating cats are necessary to complete the database.",M1

19553457,"Opioids depress cortical centers responsible for the volitional control of <e>respiration</e>.Respiratory depression limits provision of safe opioid analgesia and is the main cause of death in drug addicts. Although opioids are known to inhibit brainstem respiratory activity, their effects on cortical areas that mediate respiration are less well understood. Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine how brainstem and cortical activity related to a short breath hold is modulated by the opioid remifentanil. We hypothesized that remifentanil would differentially depress brain areas that mediate sensory-affective components of respiration over those that mediate volitional motor control. Quantitative measures of cerebral blood flow were used to control for hypercapnia-induced changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Awareness of respiration, reflected by an urge-to-breathe score, was profoundly reduced with remifentanil. Urge to breathe was associated with activity in the bilateral insula, frontal operculum, and secondary somatosensory cortex. Localized remifentanil-induced decreases in breath hold-related activity were observed in the left anterior insula and operculum. We also observed remifentanil-induced decreases in the BOLD response to breath holding in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, the cerebellum, and periaqueductal gray, brain areas that mediate task performance. Activity in areas mediating motor control (putamen, motor cortex) and sensory-motor integration (supramarginal gyrus) were unaffected by remifentanil. Breath hold-related activity was observed in the medulla. These findings highlight the importance of higher cortical centers in providing contextual awareness of respiration that leads to appropriate modulation of respiratory control. Opioids have profound effects on the cortical centers that control breathing, which potentiates their actions in the brainstem.",M1
19551766,"Hypersensitivity to RF fields emitted from CDMA cellular phones: a provocation study.With the number of cellular phone users rapidly increasing, there is a considerable amount of public concern regarding the effects that electromagnetic fields (EMFs) from cellular phones have on health. People with self-attributed electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) complain of subjective symptoms such as headaches, insomnia, and memory loss, and attribute these symptoms to radio frequency (RF) radiation from cellular phones and/or base stations. However, EHS is difficult to diagnose because it relies on a person's subjective judgment. Various provocation studies have been conducted on EHS caused by Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) phones in which heart rate and blood pressure or subjective symptoms were investigated. However, there have been few sham-controlled provocation studies on EHS with Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) phones where physiological parameters, subjective symptoms, and perception of RF radiation for EHS and non-EHS groups were simultaneously investigated. In this study, two volunteer groups of 18 self-reported EHS and 19 non-EHS persons were tested for both sham and real RF exposure from CDMA cellular phones with a 300 mW maximum exposure that lasted half an hour. We investigated not only the physiological parameters such as heart rate, <e>respiration</e> rate, and heart rate variability (HRV), but also various subjective symptoms and the perception of EMF. In conclusion, RF exposure did not have any effects on physiological parameters or subjective symptoms in either group. As for EMF perception, there was no evidence that the EHS group better perceived EMF than the non-EHS group.",M1
19545793,"Effects of <e>respiration</e>-induced density variations on dose distributions in radiotherapy of lung cancer.PURPOSE: To determine the effect of respiration-induced density variations on the estimated dose delivered to moving structures and, consequently, to evaluate the necessity of using full four-dimensional (4D) treatment plan optimization. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 10 patients with large tumor motion (median, 1.9 cm; range, 1.1-3.6 cm), the clinical treatment plan, designed using the mid-ventilation ([MidV]; i.e., the 4D-CT frame closest to the time-averaged mean position) CT scan, was recalculated on all 4D-CT frames. The cumulative dose was determined by transforming the doses in all breathing phases to the MidV geometry using deformable registration and then averaging the results. To determine the effect of density variations, this cumulative dose was compared with the accumulated dose after similarly deforming the planned (3D) MidV-dose in each respiratory phase using the same transformation (i.e.,  blurring the dose ). RESULTS: The accumulated tumor doses, including and excluding density variations, were almost identical. Relative differences in the minimum gross tumor volume (GTV) dose were less than 2% for all patients. The relative differences were even smaller in the mean lung dose and the V20 (&lt;0.5% and 1%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The effect of respiration-induced density variations on the dose accumulated over the respiratory cycle was very small, even in the presence of considerable respiratory motion. A full 4D-dose calculation for treatment planning that takes into account such density variations is therefore not required. Planning using the MidV-CT derived from 4D-CT with an appropriate margin for geometric uncertainties is an accurate and safe method to account for respiration-induced anatomy variations.",M1

INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly and equally divided into the control and other two intervention groups, who were advised to do 3 months of slow-breathing and fast-breathing exercises, respectively. Baseline and postintervention recording of blood pressure (BP), autonomic function tests such as standing-to-lying ratio (S/L ratio), immediate heart rate response to standing (30:15 ratio), Valsalva ratio, heart rate variation with <e>respiration</e> (E/I ratio), hand-grip test, and cold pressor response were done in all subjects. RESULTS: Slow breathing had a stronger effect than fast breathing. BP decreased longitudinally over a 3-month period with both interventions. S/L ratio, 30:15 ratio, E/I ratio, and BP response in the hand grip and cold pressor test showed significant change only in patients practicing the slow-breathing exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Both types of breathing exercises benefit patients with hypertension. However, improvement in both the sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity may be the mechanism that is associated in those practicing the slow-breathing exercise.",M1
19520831,"Growth retardation and altered autonomic control in mice lacking brain serotonin.Serotonin synthesis in mammals is initiated by 2 distinct tryptophan hydroxylases (TPH), TPH1 and TPH2. By genetically ablating TPH2, we created mice (Tph2(-/-)) that lack serotonin in the central nervous system. Surprisingly, these mice can be born and survive until adulthood. However, depletion of serotonin signaling in the brain leads to growth retardation and 50% lethality in the first 4 weeks of postnatal life. Telemetric monitoring revealed more extended daytime sleep, suppressed <e>respiration</e>, altered body temperature control, and decreased blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) during nighttime in Tph2(-/-) mice. Moreover, Tph2(-/-) females, despite being fertile and producing milk, exhibit impaired maternal care leading to poor survival of their pups. These data confirm that the majority of central serotonin is generated by TPH2. TPH2-derived serotonin is involved in the regulation of behavior and autonomic pathways but is not essential for adult life.",M1
19515506,"Do tumors in the lung deform during normal <e>respiration</e>? An image registration investigation.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether lung tumors may be described adequately using a rigid body assumption or whether they deform during normal respiration. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with early stage non-small-cell lung cancer underwent four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) simulation. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated on the 4D CT images. Image registration was performed in the vicinity of the GTV. The volume of interest for registration was the GTV and minimal volume of surrounding non-GTV tissue. Three types of registration were performed: translation only, translation + rotation, and deformable. The GTV contour from end-inhale was mapped to end-exhale using the registration-derived transformation field. The results were evaluated using three metrics: overlap index (OI), root-mean-squared distance (RMS), and Hausdorff distance (HD). RESULTS: After translation only image registration, on average OI increased by 21.3%, RMS and HD reduced by 1.2 mm and 2.0 mm, respectively. The succeeding increases in OI after translation + rotation and deformable registration were 1.1% and 1.4% respectively. The succeeding reductions in RMS were 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm respectively. No reduction in HD was observed after translation + rotation and deformable image registration compared with translation only registration. The difference in the results from the three registration scenarios was independent of GTV size and motion amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: The primary effect of normal respiration on lung tumors was the translation of tumors. Rotation and deformation of lung tumors was determined to be minimal.",M1
20437955,"Carbon and water fluxes from ponderosa pine forests disturbed by wildfire and thinning.Disturbances alter ecosystem carbon dynamics, often by reducing carbon uptake and stocks. We compared the impact of two types of disturbances that represent the most likely future conditions of currently dense ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern United States: (1) high-intensity fire and (2) thinning, designed to reduce fire intensity. High-severity fire had a larger impact on ecosystem carbon uptake and storage than thinning. Total ecosystem carbon was 42% lower at the intensely burned site, 10 years after burning, than at the undisturbed site. Eddy covariance measurements over two years showed that the burned site was a net annual source of carbon to the atmosphere whereas the undisturbed site was a sink. Net primary production (NPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency were lower at the burned site than at the undisturbed site. In contrast, thinning decreased total ecosystem carbon by 18%, and changed the site from a carbon sink to a source in the first posttreatment year. Thinning also decreased ET, reduced the limitation of drought on carbon uptake during summer, and did not change water use efficiency. Both disturbances reduced ecosystem carbon uptake by decreasing gross primary production (55% by burning, 30% by thinning) more than total ecosystem <e>respiration</e> (TER; 33-47% by burning, 18% by thinning), and increased the contribution of soil carbon dioxide efflux to TER. The relationship between TER and temperature was not affected by either disturbance. Efforts to accurately estimate regional carbon budgets should consider impacts on carbon dynamics of both large disturbances, such as high-intensity fire, and the partial disturbance of thinning that is often used to prevent intense burning. Our results show that thinned forests of ponderosa pine in the southwestern United States are a desirable alternative to intensively burned forests to maintain carbon stocks and primary production.",M2

20395592,"Erythropoietin activates mitochondrial biogenesis and couples red cell mass to mitochondrial mass in the heart.RATIONALE: Erythropoietin (EPO) is often administered to cardiac patients with anemia, particularly from chronic kidney disease, and stimulation of erythropoiesis may stabilize left ventricular and renal function by recruiting protective effects beyond the correction of anemia. OBJECTIVE: We examined the hypothesis that EPO receptor (EpoR) ligand-binding, which activates endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), regulates the prosurvival program of mitochondrial biogenesis in the heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the effects of EPO on mitochondrial biogenesis over 14 days in healthy mice. Mice expressing a mitochondrial green fluorescent protein reporter construct demonstrated sharp increases in myocardial mitochondrial density after 3 days of EPO administration that peaked at 7 days and surpassed hepatic or renal effects and anteceded significant increases in blood hemoglobin content. Quantitatively, in wild-type mice, complex II activity, state 3 <e>respiration</e>, and mtDNA copy number increased significantly; also, resting energy expenditure and natural running speed improved, with no evidence of an increase in left ventricular mass index. Mechanistically, EPO activated cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis by enhancement of nuclear respiratory factor-1, PGC-1alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha), and mitochondrial transcription factor-A gene expression in wild-type but not in eNOS(-/-) or protein kinase B (Akt1)(-/-) mice. EpoR was required, because EpoR silencing in cardiomyocytes blocked EPO-mediated nuclear translocation of nuclear respiratory factor-1. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a new physiological and protective role for EPO, acting through its cell surface receptor and eNOS-Akt1 signal transduction, in matching cardiac mitochondrial mass to the convective O(2) transport capacity as erythrocyte mass expands.",M2
20392690,"Compensations for diminished terminal oxidase activity in Escherichia coli: cytochrome bd-II-mediated <e>respiration</e> and glutamate metabolism.Escherichia coli possesses cytochrome bo' (CyoABCDE), cytochrome bd-I (CydAB), and cytochrome bd-II (AppBC) quinol oxidases, all of which can catalyze the terminal step in the aerobic respiratory chain, the reduction of oxygen by ubiquinol. Although CydAB has a role in the generation of DeltapH, AppBC has been proposed to alleviate the accumulation of electrons in the quinone pool during respiratory stress via electroneutral ubiquinol oxidation. A cydB mutant strain exhibited lower respiration rates while maintaining a wild type growth rate. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a dramatic up-regulation of AppBC in the cydB strain, accompanied by the induction of genes involved in glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antiport, the GABA shunt, the glyoxylate shunt, respiration (including appBC), motility, and osmotic stress. Transcription factor modeling suggests that the underpinning regulation is largely controlled by H-NS, GadX, FlhDC, and AppY. The transcriptional adaptations imply that cydB cells contribute to the proton motive force via consumption of intracellular protons and glutamate/GABA antiport. Indeed, supplementation of culture medium with l-glutamate stimulates growth in a cydB strain. Phenotype analyses of the cydB strain confirm decreased motility and elevated acid resistance and also an elevated cytochrome d spectroscopic signal in cells grown at low pH. We propose a mechanism via which E. coli can compensate for the loss of cytochrome bd-I activity; cytochrome bd-II-mediated quinol oxidation prevents the accumulation of NADH, whereas GABA synthesis/antiport maintains the proton motive force for ATP production.",M2
20355114,"Effect of atmosphere composition on the quality of ready-to-use broccoli raab (Brassica rapa L.).BACKGROUND: Many leafy brassicas are widely used for ready-to-use salads. Broccoli raab (Brassica rapa L.), also called turnip top, or rapini, is extensively cultivated in southern Italy. The edible portion is made up of the green, immature inflorescences and the stem with its most tender leaves. Recently, interest in this crop has increased among European consumers; moreover, a substantial increase in consumption could come from the ready-to-use product. RESULTS: The effects of four different atmosphere compositions (air, 3% O(2) in nitrogen, 3% O(2) + 10% CO(2) in air, and 10% CO(2) in air) on quality attributes of ready-to-use broccoli raab were studied. Controlled atmosphere affected appearance, composition, <e>respiration</e> rate, weight loss, and presence of off-odours. Storage of broccoli raab florets under low oxygen conditions delayed post-cutting deterioration during storage at 5 degrees C and preserved appearance and typical odour, up to 17 days. Moreover, respiration rate as well as loss of green colour, chlorophyll and vitamin C were also slowed down in this condition. Finally, in this study no effect of controlled atmosphere storage was found on total phenols content and antioxidant activity. CONCLUSION: Results showed that cold storage in 3% O(2) can be beneficial in order to maintain quality of ready-to-use, broccoli raab for up to 17 days.",M2
20338478,"Activated macrophages as a novel determinant of tumor cell radioresponse: the role of nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of cellular <e>respiration</e> and oxygen sparing.PURPOSE: Nitric oxide (NO), synthesized by the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), is known to inhibit metabolic oxygen consumption because of interference with mitochondrial respiratory activity. This study examined whether activation of iNOS (a) directly in tumor cells or (b) in bystander macrophages may improve radioresponse through sparing of oxygen. METHODS AND MATERIALS: EMT-6 tumor cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages were exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-gamma, and examined for iNOS expression by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and enzymatic activity. Tumor cells alone, or combined with macrophages were subjected to metabolic hypoxia and analyzed for radiosensitivity by clonogenic assay, and for oxygen consumption by electron paramagnetic resonance and a Clark-type electrode. RESULTS: Both tumor cells and macrophages displayed a coherent picture of iNOS induction at transcriptional/translational levels and NO/nitrite production, whereas macrophages showed also co-induction of the inducible heme oxygenase-1, which is associated with carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin production. Activation of iNOS in tumor cells resulted in a profound oxygen sparing and a 2.3-fold radiosensitization. Bystander NO-producing, but not CO-producing, macrophages were able to block oxygen consumption by 1.9-fold and to radiosensitize tumor cells by 2.2-fold. Both effects could be neutralized by aminoguanidine, a metabolic iNOS inhibitor. An improved radioresponse was clearly observed at macrophages to tumor cells ratios ranging between 1:16 to 1:1. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first, as far as we are aware, to provide evidence that iNOS may induce radiosensitization through oxygen sparing, and illuminates NO-producing macrophages as a novel determinant of tumor cell radioresponse within the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.",M2
20332444,"The in vitro effects of tricyclic drugs and dexamethasone on cellular <e>respiration</e> of malignant glioma.BACKGROUND: In this investigation the effects of tricyclic drugs on cellular respiration were studied using the anaplastic astrocytoma cell line IPSB-18 by use of a Clark-type oxygen electrode which measured changes in cellular respiration rate (oxygen consumption), in a dose-response assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The drugs investigated were clomipramine, norclomipramine, amitriptyline and doxepin. In addition, the combined effects of dexamethasone and clomipramine on cellular respiration were investigated. RESULTS: It was established that at lower concentrations (0.14 mM-0.5 mM) amitriptyline was the most potent inhibitor of cellular respiration. Previous studies have indicated that inhibition of cellular respiration is considered an indicator of apoptosis. Overall, it appeared that clomipramine and its metabolite norclomipramine were the most potent inhibitors of cellular respiration in glioma cells over the concentration range 0.5-0.9 mM. Dexamethasone was able to induce inhibition of cellular respiration both alone in glioma cells, and in combination with clomipramine, where it had an additive or synergistic effect, thereby increasing cell death. CONCLUSION: The extensive research currently ongoing and previously reported regarding the use of clomipramine as a potential antineoplastic agent aimed at targeting the mitochondria of gliomas is promising.",M2
20221632,"Thermal clamping of temperature-regulating flowers reveals the precision and limits of the biochemical regulatory mechanism.The flowers of several families of seed plants warm themselves when they bloom. In some species, thermogenesis is regulated, increasing the rate of <e>respiration</e> at lower ambient temperature (T (a)) to maintain a somewhat stable floral temperature (T (f)). The precision of this regulation is usually measured by plotting T (f) over T (a). However, such measurements are influenced by environmental conditions, including wind speed, humidity, radiation, etc. This study eliminates environmental effects by experimentally 'clamping' T (f) at constant, selected levels and then measuring stabilized respiration rate. Regulating flowers show decreasing respiration with rising T (f) (Q (10) &lt; 1). Q (10) therefore becomes a measure of the biochemical 'precision' of temperature regulation: lower Q (10) values indicate greater sensitivity of respiration to T (f) and a narrower range of regulated temperatures. At the lower end of the regulated range, respiration is maximal, and further decreases in floral temperature cause heat production to diminish. Below a certain tissue temperature ('switching temperature'), heat loss always exceeds heat production, so thermoregulation becomes impossible. This study compared three species of thermoregulatory flowers with distinct values of precision and switching temperature. Precision was highest in Nelumbo nucifera (Q (10) = 0.16) moderate in Symplocarpus renifolius (Q (10) = 0.48) and low in Dracunculus vulgaris (Q (10) = 0.74). Switching temperatures were approximately 30, 15 and 20 degrees C, respectively. There were no relationships between precision, switching temperature or maximum respiration rate. High precision reveals a powerful inhibitory mechanism that overwhelms the tendency of temperature to increase respiration. Variability in the shape and position of the respiration-temperature curves must be accounted for in any explanation of the control of respiration in thermoregulatory flowers.",M2

With a novel technique for imaging intracellular O(2) levels using green fluorescent protein (GFP), we examined the possibility that diffusional O(2) concentration gradients might be involved in the cellular hypoxic sensing in cultured Hep3B cells. In the present study, we failed to demonstrate significant gradients of intracellular O(2) when mitochondrial respiration was maximally elevated by an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, we conclude that intracellular O(2) gradients may be negligible at normal mitochondrial O(2) demand in these cells.",M2
20215120,"Component <e>respiration</e>, ecosystem respiration and net primary production of a mature black spruce forest in northern Quebec.We measured respiratory fluxes of carbon dioxide by aboveground tree components and soil respiration with chambers in 2005 and scaled up these measurements over space and time to estimate annual ecosystem respiration (R(e)) at a mature black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) ecosystem in Quebec, Canada. We estimated periodic annual net primary production (NPP) for this ecosystem also. R(e) was estimated at 10.32 Mg C ha(-)(1) year(-)(1); heterotrophic respiration (R(h)) accounted for 52% of R(e) and autotrophic respiration (R(a)) accounted for the remainder. We estimated NPP at 3.02 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), including production of bryophyte biomass but not including shrub NPP. We used these estimates of carbon fluxes to calculate a carbon use efficiency [CUE = NPP/(NPP + R(a))] of 0.38. This estimate of CUE is similar to those reported for other boreal forest ecosystems and it is lower than the value frequently used in global studies. Based on the estimate of R(h) being greater than the estimate of NPP, the ecosystem was determined to emit approximately 2.38 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) to the atmosphere in 2005. Estimates of gross primary production (GPP = NPP + R(a)) and R(e) differed substantially from estimates of these fluxes derived from eddy covariance measurements during 2005 at this site. The ecological estimates of GPP and R(e) were substantially greater than those estimated for eddy covariance measurements. Applying a correction for lack of energy balance closure to eddy covariance estimates reduces differences with ecological estimates. We reviewed possible sources of systematic error in ecological estimates and discuss other possible explanations for these discrepancies.",M2

20204766,"Cell <e>respiration</e> under hypoxia: facts and artefacts in mitochondrial oxygen kinetics.When oxygen supply to tissues is limiting, mitochondrial respiration and ATP production are compromised. To assess the bioenergetic consequences under normoxia and hypoxia, quantitative evaluation of mitochondrial oxygen kinetics is required. Using high-resolution respirometry, the  apparent K (m)  for oxygen or p (50) of respiration in 32D cells was determined at 0.05 +/- 0.01 kPa (0.4 mmHg, 0.5 microM, 0.25% air saturation). Close agreement with p (50) of isolated mitochondria indicates that intracellular gradients are small in small cells at routine activity. At intracellular p (O2) &lt;2 kPa (15 mmHg, 10% air saturation) in various tissues under normoxia, respiration is limited by &gt;2% with a p (50) of 0.05 kPa. Over-estimation of p (50) at 0.4 kPa (3 mmHg) would imply significant (&gt;17%) oxygen limitation of respiration under intracellular normoxia. Based on a critical review, we conclude that p (50) ranges from 0.01 to 0.10 kPa in mitochondria and small cells in the absence of inhibitors of cytochrome c oxidase, whereas experimental artefacts explain the controversial &gt;200-fold range of p (50) in the literature on mitochondrial oxygen kinetics.",M2

From within the 7 known human sirtuins, SIRT3 recently stepped out of the shadow of SIRT1 showing strong effects on stress response, apoptosis, cell cycle and energy metabolism, mimicking effects of caloric restriction.

20194621,"Human mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase corrects mitochondrial dysfunctions due to the tRNALeu(UUR) A3243G mutation, associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like symptoms and diabetes.Mutations in mitochondrial tRNA genes are associated with a wide spectrum of human diseases. In particular, the tRNA(Leu(UUR)) A3243G mutation causes mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like symptoms (MELAS) and 2% of cases of type 2 diabetes. The primary defect in this mutation was an inefficient aminoacylation of the tRNA(Leu(UUR)). In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of the A3243G mutation and whether the overexpression of human mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LARS2) in the cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cells carrying the A3243G mutation corrects the mitochondrial dysfunctions. Human LARS2 localizes exclusively to mitochondria, and LARS2 is expressed ubiquitously but most abundantly in tissues with high metabolic rates. We showed that the alteration of aminoacylation tRNA(Leu(UUR)) caused by the A3243G mutation led to mitochondrial translational defects and thereby reduced the aminoacylated efficiencies of tRNA(Leu(UUR)) as well as tRNA(Ala) and tRNA(Met). We demonstrated that the transfer of human mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase into the cybrid cells carrying the A3243G mutation improved the efficiency of aminoacylation and stability of mitochondrial tRNAs and then increased the rates of mitochondrial translation and <e>respiration</e>, consequently correcting the mitochondrial dysfunction.

20188913,"A Clark-type oxygen chip for in situ estimation of the respiratory activity of adhering cells.A Clark-type oxygen chip consisting of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) reservoir containing an amino group-modified PDMS oxygen-permeable membrane (OPM) and a glass substrate containing a three-electrode detector has been constructed by using microfabrication techniques, and it is utilized for in situ measurement of the <e>respiration</e> activity of adhering cells. Use of the alginate sol electrolyte and the electroplating Ag/AgCl pseudo-reference electrode can effectively diminish the crosstalk between the electrochemical electrodes and supply a stable potential for the detection of dissolved oxygen, respectively. The Clark-type oxygen chips possess only 1.00% residual current, response time of 13.4s and good linearity with a correlation coefficient of 0.9933. The modification of amino groups for the OPM obviously facilitates the adhesion of HeLa cells onto the PDMS OPM surface and allows the cells to spread after 2h of incubation. The oxygen consumption of the cells in the cell-adhesion process increases with the adhesion time, and the increment of cellular oxygen consumption per minute reaches a maximum after 30 min of incubation. Moreover, the change in the respiration activity of adhering HeLa cells stimulated by the high concentration of glucose or propofol anaesthetic can be monitored in real time with the Clark-type oxygen chip.",M2
20167065,"Transcriptional regulation of <e>respiration</e> in yeast metabolizing differently repressive carbon substrates.BACKGROUND: Depending on the carbon source, Saccharomyces cerevisiae displays various degrees of respiration. These range from complete respiration as in the case of ethanol, to almost complete fermentation, and thus very low degrees of respiration on glucose. While many key regulators are known for these extreme cases, we focus here on regulators that are relevant at intermediate levels of respiration. RESULTS: We address this question by linking the functional degree of respiration to transcriptional regulation via enzyme abundances. Specifically, we investigated aerobic batch cultures with the differently repressive carbon sources glucose, mannose, galactose and pyruvate. Based on 13C flux analysis, we found that the respiratory contribution to cellular energy production was largely absent on glucose and mannose, intermediate on galactose and highest on pyruvate. In vivo abundances of 40 respiratory enzymes were quantified by GFP-fusions under each condition. During growth on the partly and fully respired substrates galactose and pyruvate, several TCA cycle and respiratory chain enzymes were significantly up-regulated. From these enzyme levels and the known regulatory network structure, we determined the probability for a given transcription factor to cause the coordinated expression changes. The most probable transcription factors to regulate the different degrees of respiration were Gcr1p, Cat8p, the Rtg-proteins and the Hap-complex. For the latter three ones we confirmed their importance for respiration by quantifying the degree of respiration and biomass yields in the corresponding deletion strains. CONCLUSIONS: Cat8p is required for wild-type like respiration, independent of its known activation of gluconeogenic genes. The Rtg-proteins and the Hap-complex are essential for wild-type like respiration under partially respiratory conditions. Under fully respiratory conditions, the Hap-complex, but not the Rtg-proteins are essential for respiration.",M2
20151196,"Inhibition of mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> mediates apoptosis induced by the anti-tumoral alkaloid lamellarin D.Lamellarin D (Lam D), a marine alkaloid, exhibits a potent cytotoxicity against many different tumors. The pro-apoptotic function of Lam D has been attributed to its direct induction of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). This study was undertaken to explore the mechanisms through which Lam D promotes changes in mitochondrial function and as a result apoptosis. The use of eight Lam derivatives provides useful structure-apoptosis relationships. We demonstrate that Lam D and structural analogues induce apoptosis of cancer cells by acting directly on mitochondria inducing reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, swelling and cytochrome c release. Cyclosporin A, a well-known inhibitor of MPT, completely prevents mitochondrial signs of apoptosis. The drug decreases calcium uptake by mitochondria but not by microsomes indicating that Lam D-dependent permeability is specific to mitochondrial membranes. In addition, upon Lam D exposure, a rapid decline of mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis occurs in isolated mitochondria as well as in intact cells. Evaluation of the site of action of Lam D on the electron-transport chain revealed that the activity of respiratory chain complex III is reduced by a half. To determine whether Lam D could induce MPT-dependent apoptosis by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, we generated respiration-deficient cells (rho0) derived from human melanoma cells. In comparison to parental cells, rho0 cells are totally resistant to the induction of MPT-dependent apoptosis by Lam D. Our results indicate that functional mitochondria are required for Lam D-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is responsible for MPT-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells induced by Lam-D.",M2

20144583,"Kinetic model of the inhibition of <e>respiration</e> by endogenous nitric oxide in intact cells.Nitric oxide (NO) inhibits mitochondrial respiration by decreasing the apparent affinity of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) for oxygen. Using iNOS-transfected HEK 293 cells to achieve regulated intracellular NO production, we determined NO and O(2) concentrations and mitochondrial O(2) consumption by high-resolution respirometry over a range of O(2) concentrations down to nanomolar. Inhibition of respiration by NO was reversible, and complete NO removal recovered cell respiration above its routine reference values. Respiration was observed even at high NO concentrations, and the dependence of IC(50) on [O(2)] exhibits a characteristic but puzzling parabolic shape; both these features imply that CcO is protected from complete inactivation by NO and are likely to be physiologically relevant. We present a kinetic model of CcO inhibition by NO that efficiently predicts experimentally determined respiration at physiological O(2) and NO concentrations and under hypoxia, and accurately predicts the respiratory responses under hyperoxia. The model invokes competitive and uncompetitive inhibition by binding of NO to the reduced and oxidized forms of CcO, respectively, and suggests that dissociation of NO from reduced CcO may involve its O(2)-dependent oxidation. It also explains the non-linear dependence of IC(50) on O(2) concentration, and the hyperbolic increase of c(50) as a function of NO concentration.",M2

20132468,"Mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> and respiration-associated proteins in cell lines created through Parkinson's subject mitochondrial transfer.Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with perturbed mitochondrial function. Studies of cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines containing mitochondria from PD subjects suggest complex I dysfunction in particular is a relatively upstream biochemical defect. To evaluate potential downstream consequences of PD mitochondrial dysfunction, we used a cybrid approach to model PD mitochondrial dysfunction; our cybrid cell lines were generated via transfer of PD or control subject platelet mitochondria to mtDNA-depleted NT2 cells. To confirm our PD cybrid mitochondria did indeed differ from control cybrid mitochondria we measured complex I V(max) activities. Consistent with other PD cybrid reports, relative to control cybrid cell lines the PD cybrid cell line mean complex I V(max) activity was reduced. In this validated model, we used an oxygen electrode to characterize PD cybrid mitochondrial respiration. Although whole cell basal oxygen consumption was comparable between the PD and control cybrid groups, the proton leak was increased and maximum respiratory capacity was decreased in the PD cybrids. PD cybrids also had reduced SIRT1 phosphorylation, reduced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha levels, and increased NF-kB activation. We conclude mitochondrial respiration and pathways influenced by aerobic metabolism are altered in NT2 cybrid cell lines generated through transfer of PD subject platelet mitochondria.",M2
20095069,"Cardiac and metabolic effects of hypothermia and inhaled  hydrogen sulfide in anesthetized and ventilated mice.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis whether inhaled hydrogen sulfide amplifies the effects of deliberate hypothermia during anesthesia and mechanical ventilation as hypothermia is used to provide organ protection after brain trauma or circulatory arrest. Awake mice inhaling hydrogen sulfide exhibit reduced energy expenditure, hypothermia, and bradycardia despite unchanged systolic heart function. In rodents, anesthesia alone causes decreased metabolic rate and thus hypothermia and bradycardia. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled, randomized study. SETTING: University animal research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Male C57/B6 mice. INTERVENTIONS: After surgical instrumentation (central venous, left ventricular pressure-conductance catheters, ultrasound flow probes on the portal vein and superior mesenteric artery), normo- or hypothermic animals (core temperature = 38 degrees C and 27 degrees C) received either 100 ppm hydrogen sulfide or vehicle over 5 hrs (3 hrs hydrogen sulfide during normothermia). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During normothermia, hydrogen sulfide had no hemodynamic or metabolic effect. With or without hydrogen sulfide, hypothermia decreased blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output, whereas stroke volume, ejection fraction, and end-diastolic pressure remained unaffected. Myocardial and hepatic oxidative deoxyribonucleic acid damage (comet assay) and endogenous glucose production (rate of appearance of 1,2,3,4,5,6-13C6-glucose) were similar in all groups. Hypothermia comparably decreased CO2 production with or without inhaled hydrogen sulfide. During hypothermia, inhaled hydrogen sulfide increased the glucose oxidation rate (derived from the expiratory 13CO2/12CO2 ratio). This shift toward preferential carbohydrate utilization coincided with a significantly attenuated responsiveness of hepatic mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> to stimulation with exogenous cytochrome-c-oxidase (high-resolution respirometry). CONCLUSIONS: In anesthetized and mechanically ventilated mice, inhaled hydrogen sulfide did not amplify the systemic hemodynamic and cardiac effects of hypothermia alone. The increased aerobic glucose oxidation together with the reduced responsiveness of cellular respiration to exogenous cytochrome-c stimulation suggest that, during hypothermia, inhaled hydrogen sulfide improved the yield of mitochondrial respiration, possibly via the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity. Hence, inhaled hydrogen sulfide may offer metabolic benefit during therapeutic hypothermia.",M2
20089120,"Neuronal expression of a single-subunit yeast  NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Ndi1) extends  Drosophila lifespan.The 'rate of living' theory predicts that longevity should be inversely correlated with the rate of mitochondrial <e>respiration</e>. However, recent studies in a number of model organisms, including mice, have reported that interventions that retard the aging process are, in fact, associated with an increase in mitochondrial activity. To better understand the relationship between energy metabolism and longevity, we supplemented the endogenous respiratory chain machinery of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with the alternative single-subunit NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Ndi1) of the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we report that expression of Ndi1 in fly mitochondria leads to an increase in NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity, oxygen consumption, and ATP levels. In addition, exogenous Ndi1 expression results in increased CO2 production in living flies. Using an inducible gene-expression system, we expressed Ndi1 in different cells and tissues and examined the impact on longevity. In doing so, we discovered that targeted expression of Ndi1 in fly neurons significantly increases lifespan without compromising fertility or physical activity. These findings are consistent with the idea that enhanced respiratory chain activity in neuronal tissue can prolong fly lifespan.",M2
20086128,"Effects of cadmium exposure and intermittent anoxia on nitric oxide metabolism in eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica.Nitric oxide (NO) is an intracellular signaling molecule synthesized by a group of enzymes called nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and involved in regulation of many cellular functions including mitochondrial metabolism and bioenergetics. In invertebrates, the involvement of NO in bioenergetics and metabolic responses to environmental stress is poorly understood. We determined sensitivity of mitochondrial and cellular <e>respiration</e> to NO and the effects of cadmium (Cd) and intermittent anoxia on NO metabolism in eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica. NOS activity was strongly suppressed by exposure to 50 microg l(-1) Cd for 30 days (4.76 vs 1.19 pmol NO min(-1) mg(-1) protein in control and Cd-exposed oysters, respectively) and further decreased during anoxic exposure in Cd-exposed oysters but not in their control counterparts. Nitrate/nitrite content (indicative of NO levels) decreased during anoxic exposure to less than 10% of the normoxic values and recovered within 1 h of re-oxygenation in control oysters. In Cd-exposed oysters, the recovery of the normoxic NO levels lagged behind, reflecting their lower NOS activity. Oyster mitochondrial respiration was inhibited by exogenous NO, with sensitivity on a par with that of mammalian mitochondria, and ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration was significantly more sensitive to NO than resting respiration. In isolated gill cells, manipulations of endogenous NOS activity either with a specific NOS inhibitor (aminoguanidine) or a NOS substrate (L-arginine) had no effect on respiration, likely due to the fact that mitochondria in the resting state are relatively NO insensitive. Likewise, Cd-induced stimulation of cellular respiration did not correlate with decreased NOS activity in isolated gill cells. High sensitivity of phosphorylating (ADP-stimulated) oyster mitochondria to NO suggests that regulation of bioenergetics is an evolutionarily conserved function of NO and that NO-dependent regulation of metabolism may be most prominent under the conditions of high metabolic flux when the ADP-to-ATP ratio is high.",M2
20080338,"Uptake of chromium by Salvinia minima: effect on plant growth, leaf <e>respiration</e> and carbohydrate metabolism.Metabolic responses to chromium (Cr) exposure and metal uptake were investigated using Salvinia minima plants. Cr treatment reduced the dry weight of floating and submerged leaves, while photosynthetic pigments were not affected. Measurements of respiratory oxygen uptake with and without inhibitors (KCN and SHAM) demonstrated that total respiration, alternative oxidase capacity and residual respiration were higher in Cr-treated than in Cr-untreated leaves, but the highest values were observed in floating leaves. Cr affected the soluble sugar content. Sucrose concentration was, in general, higher in Cr-treated than in Cr-untreated leaves, while the glucose concentration showed an inverse pattern. Cr also affected soluble acid invertase activity, but affectation trend was different between both leaves. Highest values of invertase activity were observed in Cr-treated floating leaves. According to our data soluble acid invertase and sucrose seem to be related to alternative oxidase capacity and residual respiration in floating and submerged leaves exposed to Cr. Thereby, this study constitutes an important contribution to understand metabolic relationships between mitochondrial respiration, alternative respiratory pathway and soluble carbohydrates in plants exposed to heavy metals.",M2
20080122,"Age-related changes in mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> and oxidative damage in the cerebral cortex of the Fischer 344 rat.This study probed possible age-related changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics in naïve Fischer 344 rats. Synaptic and extrasynaptic mitochondria were isolated from the cortex of one hemisphere of young (3-5 months), middle (12-14 months), or aged (22-24 months) rats. Respiration parameters were obtained using a Clarke-type electrode. Aged rats displayed no significant alterations in respiration, indicating mitochondria must be more resilient to the aging process than previously thought. Synaptic mitochondria displayed lower respiration capacities than the extrasynaptic fraction. Aged F344 rats appear capable of normal electron transport chain function without declines in ability to produce ATP. Markers of cortical oxidative damage (3-nitrotyrosine [3-NT], 4-hydroxynonenal [4-HNE], and protein carbonyls [PC]) were collected from the post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) from the contralateral hemisphere, and from mitochondrial samples following respiration analysis. Age-related increases in PC and 3-NT levels were found in synaptic mitochondria, whereas significant extrasynaptic elevations were only found in middle aged rats. These findings support an age-related increase in oxidative damage in the cortex, while proposing the two fractions of mitochondria are differentially affected by the aging process. Levels of oxidative damage that accumulates in the cortex with age does not appear to significantly impair cortical mitochondrial respiration of F344 rats.",M2
20080074,"Mitochondrial metabolism during fasting-induced daily torpor in mice.During fasting, mice (Mus musculus) undergo daily bouts of torpor, considerably reducing body temperature (T(b)) and metabolic rate (MR). We examined females of different laboratory strains (Balb/c, C57/6N, and CD1) to determine whether liver mitochondrial metabolism is actively reduced during torpor. In all strains, we found that state 3 (phosphorylating) <e>respiration</e> rate measured at 37 degrees C was reduced up to 35% during torpor for at least one of the substrates (glutamate and succinate) used to fuel respiration. The extent of this suppression varied and was correlated with T(b) at sampling. This suggests that, at the biochemical level, the transition to and from a hypometabolic torpid state is gradual. In fasted non-torpid animals, T(b) and MR still fluctuated greatly: T(b) dropped by as much as 4 degrees C and MR was reduced up to 25% compared to fed controls. Changes in T(b) and MR in fasted, non-torpid animals were correlated with changes in mitochondrial state 3 respiration rate measured at 37 degrees C. This suggests that fasting mice may conserve energy even when not torpid by occasionally reducing T(b) and mitochondrial oxidative capacity to reduce MR. Furthermore, proton conductance was higher in torpid compared to non-torpid animals when measured at 15 degrees C (the lower limit of torpid T(b)). This pattern is similar to that reported previously for daily torpor in Phodopus sungorus.",M2
20065494,"Large-conductance K+ channel openers induce death of human glioma cells.Large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (BKCa channels) are highly expressed in human glioma cells. It has been reported that BK(Ca) channels are present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of the human glioma cell line LN229. In the present study we investigated whether BK(Ca)-channel openers, such as CGS7181 (ethyl 2-hydroxy-1-[[(4-methylphenyl)amino]oxo]-6-trifluoromethyl-1H-indole-3-carboxylate) and CGS7184 (ethyl 1-[[(4-chlorophenyl)amino]oxo]-2-hydroxy-6-trifluoromethyl-1H-indole-3-carboxylate), affect the functioning of LN229 glioma cell mitochondria in situ. In the micromolar concentration range CGS7181 and CGS7184 induced glioma cell death. Morphological and cytometric analyses confirmed that both substances trigger the glioma cell death. This effect was not inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Lack of DNA laddering, PARP cleavage, and caspase 3 activation suggested that glioma cell death was not of the apoptotic type. We examined the effect of CGS7184 on mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial <e>respiration</e>. Potassium channel opener CGS7184 increased cell respiration and induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The latter was dependent on the presence of Ca(2+) in the external medium. It was shown that CGS7184 induced an increase of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration due to endoplasmic reticulum store depletion. In conclusion, our results show that CGS7181 and CGS7184 induce glioma cell death by increasing the cytosolic calcium concentration followed by activation of calpains.",M2
20044447,"High-throughput assay to measure oxygen consumption in digitonin-permeabilized cells of patients with mitochondrial disorders.BACKGROUND: Muscle biopsy analysis is regarded as the gold standard in diagnostic workups of patients with suspected mitochondrial disorders. Analysis of cultured fibroblasts can provide important additional diagnostic information. The measurement of individual OXPHOS complexes does not always provide sufficient information about the functional state of the complete mitochondrial energy-generating system. Thus, we optimized a high-throughput fluorescence-based methodology for oxygen consumption analysis in patient-derived cells. METHODS: We analyzed mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> in digitonin-permeabilized cells in the presence of a substrate mix containing pyruvate and malate, using a phosphorescent probe, 96-well plates, and a fluorescence plate reader. RESULTS: In control fibroblasts, we observed clear stimulation by ADP of the pyruvate + malate-driven respiration. Known inhibitors of the OXPHOS system and the Krebs cycle significantly reduced respiration. In patient fibroblasts with different OXPHOS deficiencies, ADP-stimulated respiratory activity was decreased in comparison to control cells. In several patients with reduced ATP production rate in muscle tissue but with normal OXPHOS enzyme activities, the fibroblasts displayed reduced respiratory activity. Finally, we observed a clear difference between control and complex I-deficient transmitochondrial cybrid cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the validity of the assay as a high-throughput screening method for mitochondrial function in digitonin-permeabilized cells. The assay allows primary and secondary mitochondrial abnormalities in muscle to be differentiated, which is of great importance with respect to counseling, and also will facilitate the search for new genetic defects that lead to mitochondrial disease.",M2
20036780,"Reciprocal enhancement of uptake and toxicity of cadmium and calcium in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver mitochondria.The interactive effects of cadmium (Cd) and calcium (Ca) on energy metabolism in rainbow trout liver mitochondria were studied to test the prediction that Ca would protect against Cd-induced mitochondrial liability. Isolated rainbow trout liver mitochondria were energized with malate and glutamate and exposed to increasing concentrations (5-100 microM) of Cd and Ca singly and in combination at 15 degrees C. Accumulation of Cd and Ca in the mitochondria and mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> (oxygen consumption) rates were measured. Additionally, un-energized mitochondria were incubated with low doses (1 microM) of Cd and Ca singly and in combination, with time-course measurements of cation accumulation/binding and oxygen consumption rates. In energized actively phosphorylating mitochondria, the uptake rates of both Cd and Ca were dose-dependent and enhanced when administered concurrently. Upon low-dose incubation, Cd accumulation was rapid and peaked in 5 min, while no appreciable uptake of Ca occurred. Functionally, the resting (state 4, ADP-limited) respiration rate was not affected in the dose-response exposure, but it decreased remarkably on low-dose incubation. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-stimulated respiration (state 3) rate was impaired dose-dependently with maximal inhibitions (at the highest dose, 100 microM) of 32, 64 and 73% for Ca, Cd, and combined exposures, respectively. The combined effects of Ca and Cd suggested synergistic (more than additive) action and partial additivity of effects at low and higher doses of the two cations, respectively. Moreover, on a molar basis, Cd was twice as toxic as Ca to rainbow trout liver mitochondria and when combined, approximately 90% of the effects were attributable to Cd. The coupling efficiency, as measured by respiratory control ratio (RCR) and phosphorylation efficiency, measured as ADP/O ratio, both decreased as the exposure dosage and duration increased. In addition, Cd and Ca exposure decreased mitochondrial proton leak (state 4+ respiration) rates on prolonged exposure possibly by inhibiting processes that generate mitochondrial membrane potential, the force that drives proton leak. Overall these data suggest that the widely accepted theme that Ca and Cd are competitive antagonists does not hold for mitochondrial effects and that Cd and Ca cooperate to impair oxidative phosphorylation in rainbow trout liver mitochondria.",M2
20033434,"The effect of substrate, ADP and uncoupler on the <e>respiration</e> of tomato pollen during incubation in vitro at moderately high temperature.Pollen of tomato cv. Supermarmande was collected from greenhouse-grown plants at various intervals throughout the year and arbitrarily classified as of high, medium or low respiratory activity on the basis of CO(2) production during 8 h incubation in vitro at 30 degrees C, a temperature that is considered to be moderately high for tomato fruit set. After an initial burst of respiration during the first stage of hydration at 30 degrees C (&gt;1 h), the respiration rate of pollen of all three categories declined, the decrease being greater in the lots with a low or medium respiratory activity than in the high category. During hydration (10 min after the start of incubation), the addition of succinate or reduced beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to the substrate increased the respiratory rate of slowly-respiring pollen more than that of fast-respiring pollen, but carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) had less effect. After 1-4 h incubation, the respiration rate of the slow- or medium-respiring pollen lots had decreased, but was stimulated by succinate or NADH, and to a lesser degree by ADP. By 7 h, the respiration rate of all pollen lots had declined and was stimulated less by substrate, ADP or CCCP. The oxidation of NADH by tomato pollen contrasts with the failure of other pollen species to utilize this substrate; moreover, a synergistic effect of NADH and succinate was consistently observed. We conclude that the decline in respiration during incubation for up to 4 h at 30 degrees C may reflect a lack of respiratory substrate. After 7 h, however, the decreased response to substrate indicates a loss of mitochondrial integrity or an accumulation of metabolic inhibitors. It is concluded that at 30 degrees C (a moderately high temperature for tomato pollen), the initially high rate of respiration leads to exhaustion of the endogenous respiratory substrates (particularly in pollen with low to medium respiratory activity), but subsequently to ageing and a loss of mitochondrial activity.",M2
20022920,"Thermoperiodic growth control by gibberellin does not involve changes in photosynthetic or respiratory capacities in pea.Active gibberellin (GA(1)) is an important mediator of thermoperiodic growth in pea. Plants grown under lower day than night temperature (negative DIF) elongate less and have reduced levels of GA(1) compared with plants grown at higher day than night temperature (positive DIF). By comparing the wild type (WT) and the elongated DELLA mutant la cry(s), this study has examined the effect of impaired GA signalling on thermoperiodic growth, photosynthesis, and <e>respiration</e> in pea. In the WT a negative DIF treatment reduced stem mass ratio and increased both root mass ratio and leaf mass ratio (dry weight of specific tissue related to total plant dry weight). Leaf, root and stem mass ratios of la cry(s) were not affected by DIF. Under negative DIF, specific leaf area (projected leaf area per unit leaf dry mass), biomass, and chlorophyll content of WT and la cry(s) plants were reduced. Young, expanding leaves of plants grown under negative DIF had reduced leaf area-based photosynthetic capacity. However, the highest photosynthetic electron transport rate was found in fully expanded leaves of WT plants grown under negative DIF. Negative DIF increased night respiration and was similar for both genotypes. It is concluded that GA signalling is not a major determinant of leaf area-based photosynthesis or respiration and that reduced dry weight of plants grown under negative DIF is caused by a GA-mediated reduction of photosynthetic stem and leaf tissue, reduced photosynthesis of young, expanding leaves, and reduced growth caused by low temperature in the photoperiod.",M2
20020062,"Brownie, a gene involved in building complex respiratory devices in insect eggshells.BACKGROUND: Insect eggshells must combine protection for the yolk and embryo with provisions for <e>respiration</e> and for the entry of sperm, which are ensured by aeropyles and micropyles, respectively. Insects which oviposit the eggs in an egg-case have a double problem of respiration as gas exchange then involves two barriers. An example of this situation is found in the cockroach Blattella germanica, where the aeropyle and the micropyle are combined in a complex structure called the sponge-like body. The sponge-like body has been well described morphologically, but nothing is known about how it is built up. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a library designed to find genes expressed during late chorion formation in B. germanica, we isolated the novel sequence Bg30009 (now called Brownie), which was outstanding due to its high copy number. In the present work, we show that Brownie is expressed in the follicle cells localized in the anterior pole of the oocyte in late choriogenesis. RNA interference (RNAi) of Brownie impaired correct formation of the sponge-like body and, as a result, the egg-case was also ill-formed and the eggs were not viable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results indicate that the novel gene Brownie plays a pivotal role in building up the sponge-like body. Brownie is the first reported gene involved in the construction of complex eggshell respiratory structures.",M2
20012508,"Phenotype microarray profiling of Zymomonas mobilis ZM4.In this study, we developed a Phenotype MicroArray (PM) protocol to profile cellular phenotypes in Zymomonas mobilis, which included a standard set of nearly 2,000 assays for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur source utilization, nutrient stimulation, pH and osmotic stresses, and chemical sensitivities with 240 inhibitory chemicals. We observed two positive assays for C-source utilization (fructose and glucose) using the PM screen, which uses redox chemistry and cell <e>respiration</e> as a universal reporter to profile growth phenotypes in a high-throughput 96-well plate-based format. For nitrogen metabolism, the bacterium showed a positive test results for ammonia, aspartate, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, and peptides. Z. mobilis appeared to use a diverse array of P-sources with two exceptions being pyrophosphate and tripolyphosphate. The assays suggested that Z. mobilis uses both inorganic and organic compounds as S-sources. No stimulation by nutrients was detected; however, there was evidence of partial inhibition by purines and pyrimidines, NAD, and deferoxamine. Z. mobilis was relatively resistant to acid pH, tolerating a pH down to about 4.0. It also tolerated phosphate, sulfate, and nitrate, but was rather sensitive to chloride and nitrite. Z. mobilis showed resistance to a large number of diverse chemicals that inhibit most bacteria. The information from PM analysis provides an overview of Z. mobilis physiology and a foundation for future comparisons of other wild-type and mutant Z. mobilis strains.",M2
20011041,"Extramitochondrial Ca2+ in the nanomolar range regulates glutamate-dependent oxidative phosphorylation on demand.We present unexpected and novel results revealing that glutamate-dependent oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) of brain mitochondria is exclusively and efficiently activated by extramitochondrial Ca(2+) in physiological concentration ranges (S(0.5) = 360 nM Ca(2+)). This regulation was not affected by RR, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter. Active <e>respiration</e> is regulated by glutamate supply to mitochondria via aralar, a mitochondrial glutamate/aspartate carrier with regulatory Ca(2+)-binding sites in the mitochondrial intermembrane space providing full access to cytosolic Ca(2+). At micromolar concentrations, Ca(2+) can also enter the intramitochondrial matrix and activate specific dehydrogenases. However, the latter mechanism is less efficient than extramitochondrial Ca(2+) regulation of respiration/OXPHOS via aralar. These results imply a new mode of glutamate-dependent OXPHOS regulation as a demand-driven regulation of mitochondrial function. This regulation involves the mitochondrial glutamate/aspartate carrier aralar which controls mitochondrial substrate supply according to the level of extramitochondrial Ca(2+).",M2
20008837,"Soil <e>respiration</e> fluxes in a temperate mixed forest: seasonality and temperature sensitivities differ among microbial and root-rhizosphere respiration.Although soil respiration, a major CO(2) flux in terrestrial ecosystems, is known to be highly variable with time, the response of its component fluxes to temperature and phenology is less clear. Therefore, we partitioned soil respiration (SR) into microbial (MR) and root-rhizosphere respiration (RR) using small root exclusion treatments in a mixed mountain forest in Switzerland. In addition, fine root respiration (FRR) was determined with measurements of excised roots. RR and FRR were strongly related to each other (R(2) = 0.92, n = 7), with RR contributing about 46% and FRR about 32% to total SR. RR rates increased more strongly with temperature (Q(10) = 3.2) than MR rates (Q(10) = 2.3). Since the contribution of RR to SR was found to be higher during growing (50%) than during dormant periods (40%), we separated the 2-year data set into phenophases. During the growing period of 2007, the temperature sensitivity of RR (Q(10) = 2.5, R(2) = 0.62) was similar to that of MR (Q(10) = 2.2, R(2) = 0.57). However, during the dormant period of 2006/2007, RR was not related to soil temperature (R(2) = 0.44, n.s.), in contrast to MR (Q(10) = 7.2; R(2) = 0.92). To better understand the influence of plant activity on root respiration, we related RR and FRR rates to photosynthetic active radiation (both R(2) = 0.67, n = 7, P = 0.025), suggesting increased root respiration rates during times with high photosynthesis. During foliage green-up in spring 2008, i.e., from bud break to full leaf expansion, RR increased by a factor of 5, while soil temperature increased only by about 5 degrees C, leading to an extraordinary high Q(10) of 10.6; meanwhile, the contribution of RR to SR increased from 29 to 47%. This clearly shows that root respiration and its apparent temperature sensitivity highly depend on plant phenology and thus on canopy assimilation and carbon allocation belowground.",M2
20007440,"Oscillatory growth in lily pollen tubes does not require aerobic energy metabolism.Oscillatory tip growth in pollen tubes depends on prodigious amounts of energy. We have tested the hypothesis that oscillations in the electron transport chain lead to growth oscillations in lily (Lilium formosanum). Using three respiratory inhibitors, oligomycin, antimycin A, and cyanide, we find that pollen tube growth is much less sensitive to respiratory inhibition than <e>respiration</e> is. All three block respiration at concentrations severalfold lower than necessary to inhibit growth. Mitochondrial NAD(P)H and potentiometric JC-1 fluorescence, employed as markers for electron transport chain activity, rise rapidly in response to oligomycin, as expected. Pollen tube growth stops for several minutes before resuming. Subsequent growth has a lower mean rate, but continues to oscillate, albeit with a longer period. NAD(P)H fluorescence no longer exhibits coherent oscillations, and mitochondria no longer congregate directly behind the apex: they distribute evenly throughout the cell. Postinhibition growth relies on aerobic fermentation for energy production as revealed by an increase in ethanol in the media. These data suggest that oscillatory growth depends not on a single oscillatory pacemaker but rather is an emergent property arising from a number of stable limit cycles.",M2
20007131,"Thermal acclimation of leaf dark <e>respiration</e> of beech seedlings experiencing summer drought in high and low light environments.Little is known about how environmental factors shape the short- and long-term responses of leaf respiration to temperature under field conditions despite the importance of respiration for plant and stand carbon balances. Impacts of water availability and canopy cover on leaf dark respiration (R) and temperature sensitivity were assessed in beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) seedlings in a sub-Mediterranean population. We studied seedlings established within canopy gaps (39% global site factor; GSF) that were subject to either no watering (unwatered plants; UW) or regular watering (2-10% higher volumetric topsoil water content as summer progressed; W plants) and seedlings established beneath the adjacent understorey (12% GSF). Leaf R rose exponentially with diurnal increases in temperature; the same temperature sensitivity (Q(10): 2.2) was found for understorey and gap plants, irrespective of watering treatment. Respiration estimated at 25 degrees C (R(25)) was lower in the understorey than the gaps and was significantly lower in the unwatered than in the watered gap plants by the end of summer (0.65 versus 0.80 micromol m(-2) s(-1)). R(25) declined with increasing summer temperature in all plants; however, respiration estimated at the prevailing ambient temperature did not change through the summer. There were parallel declines in R(25) and concentrations of starch and soluble sugars with increasing summer temperature for gap plants. We conclude that seasonal shifts in temperature-response curves of beech leaf R occur in both low- and high-light environments; since leaf R decreased with increasing plant water deficit, such shifts are likely to be greater whenever plants experience summer drought compared to scenarios where plants experience high rainfall in summer.",M2

We investigated effect of SSO on mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> and found that SSO substantially inhibits not only LCFA oxidation, but also oxidation of flavoprotein- and NADH-dependent substrates and generation of mitochondrial membrane potential. Experiments in rat liver, heart and kidney mitochondria demonstrated a direct effect on mitochondrial respiratory chain with the most pronounced inhibition of the complex III (IC(50) 4microM SSO). The results presented here show that SSO is a potent and irreversible inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory chain.",M2
20006572,"Inactivation of nitric oxide by cytochrome c oxidase under steady-state oxygen conditions.We have developed a <e>respiration</e> chamber that allows intact cells to be studied under controlled oxygen (O(2)) conditions. The system measures the concentrations of O(2) and nitric oxide (NO) in the cell suspension, while the redox state of cytochrome c oxidase is continuously monitored optically. Using human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a tetracycline-inducible NO synthase we show that the inactivation of NO by cytochrome c oxidase is dependent on both O(2) concentration and electron turnover of the enzyme. At a high O(2) concentration (70 microM), and while the enzyme is in turnover, NO generated by the NO synthase upon addition of a given concentration of l-arginine is partially inactivated by cytochrome c oxidase and does not affect the redox state of the enzyme or consumption of O(2). At low O(2) (15 microM), when the cytochrome c oxidase is more reduced, inactivation of NO is decreased. In addition, the NO that is not inactivated inhibits the cytochrome c oxidase, further reducing the enzyme and lowering O(2) consumption. At both high and low O(2) concentrations the inactivation of NO is decreased when sodium azide is used to inhibit cytochrome c oxidase and decrease electron turnover.",M2
19958137,"Systemic induction and role of mitochondrial alternative oxidase and nitric oxide in a compatible tomato-Tobacco mosaic virus interaction.The role of mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) and the relationship between AOX and nitric oxide (NO) in virus-induced systemic defense to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were investigated in susceptible tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants. TMV inoculation to the lower leaves induced a rapid NO synthesis and AOX activation in upper uninoculated leaves as early as 0.5 day postinoculation. Application of exogenous potassium cyanide (KCN, a cytochrome pathway inhibitor) at nonlethal concentrations and NO donor diethylamine NONOate (DEA/NO) to the upper uninoculated leaves greatly induced accumulation of AOX transcript, reduced TMV viral RNA accumulation, and increased the leaf photochemical quantum yield at photosystem II. Pretreatment with NO scavenger almost completely blocked TMV-induced AOX induction and substantially increased TMV susceptibility. Salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, an AOX inhibitor) pretreatment reduced the DEA/NO-induced cyanide-resistant <e>respiration</e> and partially compromised induced resistance to TMV. Conversely, KCN and SHAM pretreatment had very little effect on generation of NO, and pretreatment with NO scavenger did not affect KCN-induced AOX induction and TMV resistance. These results suggest that TMV-induced NO generation acts upstream and mediates AOX induction which, in turn, induces mitochondrial alternative electron transport and triggers systemic basal defense against the viral pathogen.",M2
19933320,"Effects of drought stress and subsequent rewatering on photosynthetic and respiratory pathways in Nicotiana sylvestris wild type and the mitochondrial complex I-deficient CMSII mutant.The interaction of photosynthesis and <e>respiration</e> has been studied in vivo under conditions of limited water supply and after consecutive rewatering. The role of the alternative (v(alt)) and cytochrome (v(cyt)) pathways on drought stress-induced suppression of photosynthesis and during photosynthetic recovery was examined in the Nicotiana sylvestris wild type (WT) and the complex I-deficient CMSII mutant. Although photosynthetic traits, including net photosynthesis (A(N)), stomatal (g(s)) and mesophyll conductances (g(m)), as well as respiration (v(cyt) and v(alt)) differed between well-watered CMSII and WT, similar reductions of A(N), g(s), and g(m) were observed during severe drought stress. However, total respiration (V(t)) remained slightly higher in CMSII due to the still increased v(cyt) (to match ATP demand). v(alt) and maximum carboxylation rates remained almost unaltered in both genotypes, while in CMSII, changes in photosynthetic light harvesting (i.e. Chl a/b ratio) were detected. In both genotypes, photosynthesis and respiration were restored after 2 d of rewatering, predominantly limited by a delayed stomatal response. Despite complex I dysfunction and hence altered redox balance, the CMSII mutant seems to be able to adjust its photosynthetic machinery during and after drought stress to reduce photo-oxidation and to maintain the cell redox state and the ATP level.",M2

The white or red light were found to be down-regulating factors for the mRNA content of the sdh1-2 and sdh2-3 genes and SDH catalytic activity both in A. thaliana wild-type plants and in the mutant deficient in the phytochrome B gene, but not in the mutant deficient in the phytochrome A gene, while the far-red light of 730 nm reversed the red light effect. It is concluded that phytochrome A participates in the regulation of mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> through effect on SDH expression.",M2
19931505,"Mitochondrial Complex I decrease is responsible for bioenergetic dysfunction in K-ras transformed cells.Many cancer cells are characterized by high rate of glycolysis and reduced rate of aerobic <e>respiration</e>, whose mechanism is still elusive. Here we investigate the down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in K-ras transformed mouse fibroblasts as compared to a control counterpart. Transcriptional analysis showed different expression levels of several OXPHOS nuclear genes in the two cell lines. In particular, during the exponential growth phase most genes encoding proteins of Complex I were expressed at lower levels in transformed cells. Consistently, a significant decrease of Complex I content was found in transformed cells. Moreover, analysis of NAD-dependent respiration and ATP synthesis indicated a strong decrease of Complex I activity in the mitochondria from neoplastic cells, that was confirmed by direct assay of the enzyme redox activity. At variance, succinate-dependent respiration and ATP synthesis were not significantly affected. Taken together, our results provide the new insight that the reduction of respiration observed in K-ras transformed cells is specifically due to a Complex I activity decrease.",M2
19925292,"Pentoxifylline in ischemia-induced acute kidney injury in rats.Ischemia is an important cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). Pentoxifylline has been shown to improve tissue oxygenation and endothelial function and inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production. The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible renal protective effect of pentoxifylline against ischemia by measuring mitochondrial respiratory metabolism as an index of cell damage. Rats were submitted to right nephrectomy. The left kidney was submitted to ischemia by clamping the renal artery for 45 minutes. Immediately after release of the clamp, 1 mL of a solution containing 20 mg of pentoxifylline/mL was injected intravenously, while a control group received 1 mL of normal saline intravenously. Five minutes after the injection, the left kidney was removed, homogenized, and subjected to refrigerated differential centrifugation. Mitochondrial respiratory metabolism was measured polarographically. The mitochondria isolated from the kidneys of saline-treated rats had an endogenous <e>respiration</e> of 9.20 +/- 1.0 etamol O(2)/mg protein/min compared to 8.9 +/- 1.4 etamol O(2)/mg protein/min in the pentoxifylline-treated rats (p &gt; 0.05). When stimulated by sodium succinate, the respiratory metabolism increased in a similar fashion in both groups of animals: 17.9 +/- 2.3 and 18.1 +/- 2.1 etamol O(2)/mg protein/min in the untreated and pentoxifylline-treated groups, respectively (p &gt; 0.05). In the present study, pentoxifylline was not found to exert any protective effect on the kidney. It is possible that at the time of pentoxifylline administration, the mitochondria had already been damaged by the process of ischemia, and its effect may have been insufficient to reverse cell damage.",M2
19912650,"Camptothecin and khat (Catha edulis Forsk.) induced distinct cell death phenotypes involving modulation of c-FLIPL, Mcl-1, procaspase-8 and mitochondrial function in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines.BACKGROUND: An organic extract of the recreational herb khat (Catha edulis Forsk.) triggers cell death in various leukemia cell lines in vitro. The chemotherapeutics camptothecin, a plant alkaloid topoisomerase I inhibitor, was tested side-by-side with khat in a panel of acute myeloid leukemia cell lines to elucidate mechanisms of toxicity. RESULTS: Khat had a profound effect on MOLM-13 cells inducing mitochondrial damage, chromatin margination and morphological features of autophagy. The effects of khat on mitochondrial ultrastructure in MOLM-13 correlated with strongly impaired routine <e>respiration</e>, an effect neither found in the khat-resistant MV-4-11 cells nor in camptothecin treated cells. Enforced expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein provided protection against camptothecin-induced cell death and partly against khat toxicity. Khat-induced cell death in MOLM-13 cells included reduced levels of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein, while both khat and camptothecin induced c-FLIPL cleavage and procaspase-8 activation. CONCLUSION: Khat activated a distinct cell death pathway in sensitive leukemic cells as compared to camptothecin, involving mitochondrial damage and morphological features of autophagy. This suggests that khat should be further explored in the search for novel experimental therapeutics.",M2
19910925,"The Drosophila PGC-1 homologue Spargel coordinates mitochondrial activity to insulin signalling.Mitochondrial mass and activity must be adapted to tissue function, cellular growth and nutrient availability. In mammals, the related transcriptional coactivators PGC-1alpha, PGC-1beta and PRC regulate multiple metabolic functions, including mitochondrial biogenesis. However, we know relatively little about their respective roles in vivo. Here we show that the Drosophila PGC-1 family homologue, Spargel, is required for the expression of multiple genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Accordingly, spargel mutants showed mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> defects when complex II of the electron transport chain was stimulated. Spargel, however, was not limiting for mitochondrial mass, but functioned in this respect redundantly with Delg, the fly NRF-2alpha/GABPalpha homologue. More importantly, in the larval fat body, Spargel mediated mitochondrial activity, cell growth and transcription of target genes in response to insulin signalling. In this process, Spargel functioned in parallel to the insulin-responsive transcription factor, dFoxo, and provided a negative feedback loop to fine-tune insulin signalling. Taken together, our data place Spargel at a nodal point for the integration of mitochondrial activity to tissue and organismal metabolism and growth.",M2
19906148,"Temporal heterogeneity of cold acclimation phenotypes in Arabidopsis leaves.To predict the effects of temperature changes on plant growth and performance, it is crucial to understand the impact of thermal history on leaf morphology, anatomy and physiology. Here, we document a comprehensive range of leaf phenotypes in 25/20 degrees C-grown Arabidopsis thaliana plants that were shifted to 5 degrees C for up to 2 months. When warm-grown, pre-existing (PE) leaves were exposed to cold, leaf thickness increased due to an increase in mesophyll cell size. Leaves that were entirely cold-developed (CD) were twice as thick (eight cell layers) as their warm-developed (WD) counterparts (six layers), and also had higher epidermal and stomatal cell densities. After 4 d of cold, PE leaves accumulated high levels of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC). However, glucose and starch levels declined thereafter, and after 45 d in the cold, PE leaves exhibited similar TNC to CD leaves. A similar phenomenon was observed in delta(13)C and a range of photosynthetic parameters. In cold-treated PE leaves, an increase in <e>respiration</e> (R(dark)) with cold exposure time was evident when measured at 25 degrees C but not 5 degrees C. Cold acclimation was associated with a large increase in the ratio of leaf R(dark) to photosynthesis. The data highlight the importance of understanding developmental thermal history in determining individual phenotypic traits.",M2
19897729,"Energy use efficiency is characterized by an epigenetic component that can be directed through artificial selection to increase yield.Quantitative traits, such as size and weight in animals and seed yield in plants, are distributed normally, even within a population of genetically identical individuals. For example, in plants, various factors, such as local soil quality, microclimate, and sowing depth, affect growth differences among individual plants of isogenic populations. Besides these physical factors, also epigenetic components contribute to differences in growth and yield. The network that regulates crop yield is still not well understood. Although this network is expected to have epigenetic elements, it is completely unclear whether it would be possible to shape the epigenome to increase crop yield. Here we show that energy use efficiency is an important factor in determining seed yield in canola (Brassica napus) and that it can be selected artificially through an epigenetic feature. From an isogenic canola population of which the individual plants and their self-fertilized progenies were recursively selected for <e>respiration</e> intensity, populations with distinct physiological and agronomical characteristics could be generated. These populations were found to be genetically identical, but epigenetically different. Furthermore, both the DNA methylation patterns as well as the agronomical and physiological characteristics of the selected lines were heritable. Hybrids derived from parent lines selected for high energy use efficiencies had a 5% yield increase on top of heterosis. Our results demonstrate that artificial selection allows the increase of the yield potential by selecting populations with particular epigenomic states.",M2
19895404,"Nitrogen deficiency increases the residence time of respiratory carbon in the respiratory substrate supply system of perennial ryegrass.Plant <e>respiration</e> draws on substrate pools of different functional/biochemical identity. Little is known about the effect of nitrogen deficiency on those pools' sizes, half-lives and relative contribution to respiration, and consequently, of carbon residence time in respiratory metabolism. Here we studied how nitrogen fertilization affects the respiratory carbon supply system of shoots and roots of Lolium perenne, a perennial grass. Plants grown at two nitrogen supply levels in continuous light were labelled with (13)CO(2)/(12)CO(2) for intervals ranging from 1 h to 1 month. The rate and isotopic composition of shoot, root and plant respiration were measured, and the time-courses of tracer incorporation into respired CO(2) were analysed by compartmental modelling. Nitrogen deficiency reduced specific respiration rate by 30%, but increased the size of the respiratory supply system by 30%. In consequence, mean residence time of respiratory carbon increased with nitrogen deficiency (4.6 d at high nitrogen and 9.2 d at low nitrogen supply). To a large extent, this was due to a greater involvement of stores with a long half-life in respiratory carbon metabolism of nitrogen-deficient plants. At both nitrogen supply levels, stores supplying root respiration were primarily located in the shoot, probably in the form of fructans.",M2
19892241,"Substrate-specific derangements in mitochondrial metabolism and redox balance in the atrium of the type 2 diabetic human heart.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of diabetes on oxidant balance and mitochondrial metabolism of carbohydrate- and lipid-based substrates in myocardium of type 2 diabetic patients. BACKGROUND: Heart failure represents a major cause of death among diabetic patients. It has been proposed that derangements in cardiac metabolism and oxidative stress may underlie the progression of this comorbidity, but scarce evidence exists in support of this mechanism in humans. METHODS: Mitochondrial oxygen (O(2)) consumption and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) emission were measured in permeabilized myofibers prepared from samples of the right atrial appendage obtained from nondiabetic (n = 13) and diabetic (n = 11) patients undergoing nonemergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. RESULTS: Mitochondria in atrial tissue of type 2 diabetic individuals show a sharply decreased capacity for glutamate and fatty acid-supported <e>respiration</e>, in addition to an increased content of myocardial triglycerides, as compared to nondiabetic patients. Furthermore, diabetic patients show an increased mitochondrial H(2)O(2) emission during oxidation of carbohydrate- and lipid-based substrates, depleted glutathione, and evidence of persistent oxidative stress in their atrial tissue. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are the first to directly investigate the effects of type 2 diabetes on a panoply of mitochondrial functions in the human myocardium using cellular and molecular approaches, and they show that mitochondria in diabetic human hearts have specific impairments in maximal capacity to oxidize fatty acids and glutamate, yet increased mitochondrial H(2)O(2) emission, providing insight into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of heart failure in diabetic patients.",M2
19883793,"Effects of acute heat stress and subsequent stress removal on function of hepatic mitochondrial <e>respiration</e>, ROS production and lipid peroxidation in broiler chickens.In order to investigate the effects of acute heat stress and subsequent stress removal on function of hepatic mitochondrial respiration, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation in broiler chickens, 128 six-week-old broiler chickens were kept in a controlled-environment chamber. The broiler chickens were initially kept at 25 degrees C (relative humidity, RH, 70+/-5%) for 6d and subsequently exposed to 35 degrees C (RH, 70+/-5%) for 3h, then the heat stress was removed and the temperature returned to 25 degrees C (RH, 70+/-5%). Blood and liver samples were obtained before heat exposure and at 0 (at the end of the three-hour heating episode, this group is also abbreviated as the HT group), 1, 2, 4, 8, 12h after the stress was removed. The results showed that acute heat stress induced a significant production of ROS, function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, antioxidative enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)] activity, and formation of malondialdehybe (MDA). Within the first 12h after removal of the heat stress, the acute modification of the above parameters induced by heat stress gradually approached to pre-heat levels. The results of the present study suggest that acute exposure to high temperatures may depress the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This leads to over-production of ROS, which ultimately results in lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. When the high temperature was removed, the production of ROS, mitochondrial respiratory function and oxidative injury that were induced by acute heat exposure gradually approached the levels observed before heating, in a time-dependent manner.",M2
19880514,"Increased potassium conductance of brain mitochondria induces resistance to permeability transition by enhancing matrix volume.Modulation of K(+) conductance of the inner mitochondrial membrane has been proposed to mediate preconditioning in ischemia-reperfusion injury. The mechanism is not entirely understood, but it has been linked to a decreased activation of mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT). In the present study K(+) channel activity was mimicked by picomolar concentrations of valinomycin. Isolated brain mitochondria were exposed to continuous infusions of calcium. Monitoring of extramitochondrial Ca(2+) and mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> provided a quantitative assay for mPT sensitivity by determining calcium retention capacity (CRC). Valinomycin and cyclophilin D inhibition separately and additively increased CRC. Comparable degrees of respiratory uncoupling induced by increased K(+) or H(+) conductance had opposite effects on mPT sensitivity. Protonophores dose-dependently decreased CRC, demonstrating that so-called mild uncoupling was not beneficial per se. The putative mitoK(ATP) channel opener diazoxide did not mimic the effect of valinomycin. An alkaline matrix pH was required for mitochondria to retain calcium, but increased K(+) conductance did not result in augmented DeltapH. The beneficial effect of valinomycin on CRC was not mediated by H(2)O(2)-induced protein kinase Cepsilon activation. Rather, increased K(+) conductance reduced H(2)O(2) generation during calcium infusion. Lowering the osmolarity of the buffer induced an increase in mitochondrial volume and improved CRC similar to valinomycin without inducing uncoupling or otherwise affecting respiration. We propose that increased potassium conductance in brain mitochondria may cause a direct physiological effect on matrix volume inducing resistance to pathological calcium challenges.",M2
19875463,"Mitochondrial DNA background modifies the bioenergetics of NARP/MILS ATP6 mutant cells.Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded subunit 6 of ATPase (ATP6) are associated with variable disease expression, ranging from adult onset neuropathy, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) to fatal childhood maternally inherited Leigh's syndrome (MILS). Phenotypical variations have largely been attributed to mtDNA heteroplasmy. However, there is often a discrepancy between the levels of mutant mtDNA and disease severity. Therefore, the correlation among genetic defect, bioenergetic impairment and clinical outcome in NARP/MILS remains to be elucidated. We investigated the bioenergetics of cybrids from five patients carrying different ATP6 mutations: three harboring the T8993G, one with the T8993C and one with the T9176G mutation. The bioenergetic defects varied dramatically, not only among different ATP6 mutants, but also among lines carrying the same T8993G mutation. Mutants with the most severe ATP synthesis impairment showed defective <e>respiration</e> and disassembly of respiratory chain complexes. This indicates that respiratory chain defects modulate the bioenergetic impairment in NARP/MILS cells. Sequencing of the entire mtDNA from the different mutant cell lines identified variations in structural genes, resulting in amino acid changes that destabilize the respiratory chain. Taken together, these results indicate that the mtDNA background plays an important role in modulating the biochemical defects and clinical outcome in NARP/MILS.",M2
19861415,"Pyrroloquinoline quinone stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis through cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation and increased PGC-1alpha expression.Bioactive compounds reported to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis are linked to many health benefits such increased longevity, improved energy utilization, and protection from reactive oxygen species. Previously studies have shown that mice and rats fed diets lacking in pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) have reduced mitochondrial content. Therefore, we hypothesized that PQQ can induce mitochondrial biogenesis in mouse hepatocytes. Exposure of mouse Hepa1-6 cells to 10-30 microm PQQ for 24-48 h resulted in increased citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase activity, Mitotracker staining, mitochondrial DNA content, and cellular oxygen <e>respiration</e>. The induction of this process occurred through the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), a pathway known to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. PQQ exposure stimulated phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133, activated the promoter of PGC-1alpha, and increased PGC-1alpha mRNA and protein expression. PQQ did not stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis after small interfering RNA-mediated reduction in either PGC-1alpha or CREB expression. Consistent with activation of the PGC-1alpha pathway, PQQ increased nuclear respiratory factor activation (NRF-1 and NRF-2) and Tfam, TFB1M, and TFB2M mRNA expression. Moreover, PQQ protected cells from mitochondrial inhibition by rotenone, 3-nitropropionic acid, antimycin A, and sodium azide. The ability of PQQ to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis accounts in part for action of this compound and suggests that PQQ may be beneficial in diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.",M2
19857457,"Structural characterization of a family of cytochromes c(7) involved in Fe(III) <e>respiration</e> by Geobacter sulfurreducens.Periplasmic cytochromes c(7) are important in electron transfer pathway(s) in Fe(III) respiration by Geobacter sulfurreducens. The genome of G. sulfurreducens encodes a family of five 10-kDa, three-heme cytochromes c(7). The sequence identity between the five proteins (designated PpcA, PpcB, PpcC, PpcD, and PpcE) varies between 45% and 77%. Here, we report the high-resolution structures of PpcC, PpcD, and PpcE determined by X-ray diffraction. This new information made it possible to compare the sequences and structures of the entire family. The triheme cores are largely conserved but are not identical. We observed changes, due to different crystal packing, in the relative positions of the hemes between two molecules in the crystal. The overall protein fold of the cytochromes is similar. The structure of PpcD differs most from that of the other homologs, which is not obvious from the sequence comparisons of the family. Interestingly, PpcD is the only cytochrome c(7) within the family that has higher abundance when G. sulfurreducens is grown on insoluble Fe(III) oxide compared to ferric citrate. The structures have the highest degree of conservation around  heme IV ; the protein surface around this heme is positively charged in all of the proteins, and therefore all cytochromes c(7) could interact with similar molecules involving this region. The structures and surface characteristics of the proteins near the other two hemes,  heme I  and  heme III , differ within the family. The above observations suggest that each of the five cytochromes c(7) could interact with its own redox partner via an interface involving the regions of heme I and/or heme III; this provides a possible rationalization for the existence of five similar proteins in G. sulfurreducens.",M2
19845338,"Lipophilic 2,5-disubstituted pyrroles from the marine sponge Mycale sp. inhibit mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> and HIF-1 activation.The lipid extract of the marine sponge Mycale sp. inhibited the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in a human breast tumor T47D cell-based reporter assay. Bioassay-guided isolation and structure elucidation yielded 18 new lipophilic 2,5-disubstituted pyrroles and eight structurally related known compounds. The active compounds inhibited hypoxia-induced HIF activation with moderate potency (IC50 values &lt;10 microM). Mechanistic studies revealed that the active compounds suppressed mitochondrial respiration by blocking NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) at concentrations that inhibited HIF-1 activation. Under hypoxic conditions, reactive oxygen species produced by mitochondrial complex III are believed to act as a signal of cellular hypoxia that leads to HIF-1alpha protein induction and activation. By inhibiting electron transport (or delivery) to complex III under hypoxic conditions, lipophilic Mycale pyrroles appear to disrupt mitochondrial ROS-regulated HIF-1 signaling.",M2
19834492,"Involvement of cytochrome c oxidase subunits Va and Vb in the regulation of cancer cell metabolism by Bcl-2.Bcl-2 has been shown to promote survival of cancer cells by maintaining a slight pro-oxidant state through elevated mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> during basal conditions. On oxidative stress, Bcl-2 moderates mitochondrial respiration through cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity to prevent an excessive buildup of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by-production from electron transport activities. However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of Bcl-2-mediated ROS regulation and its impact on carcinogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we show that Bcl-2 expression positively influences the targeting of nuclear-encoded COX Va and Vb to the mitochondria of cancer cells. In addition, evidence is presented in support of a protein-protein interaction between COX Va and Bcl-2, involving the BH2 domain of Bcl-2. Interestingly, episodes of serum withdrawal, glucose deprivation or hypoxia aimed at inducing early oxidative stress triggered Bcl-2-overexpressing cells to preserve mitochondrial levels of COX Va while depressing COX Vb, whereas the reverse was observed in mock-transfected cells. The unique manner in which Bcl-2 adjusted COX subunits during these physiological stress triggers had a profound impact on the resultant decrease in COX activity and maintenance of mitochondrial ROS levels, thus delineating a novel mechanism for the homeostatic role of Bcl-2 in the redox biology and metabolism of cancer cells.",M2
19825019,"The significance of phloem transport for the speed with which canopy photosynthesis and belowground <e>respiration</e> are linked.Ecosystem respiration is known to vary following changes in canopy photosynthesis. However, the timing of this coupling is not well understood. Here, we summarize the literature on soil and ecosystem respiration where the speed of transfer of photosynthetic sugars from the plant canopy via the phloem to the roots was determined. Estimates of the transfer speed can be grouped according to whether the study employed isotopic or canopy/soil flux-based techniques. These two groups should provide different estimates of transfer times because transport of sucrose molecules, and pressure-concentration waves, in phloem differ. A steady-state and a dynamic photosynthesis/phloem-transport/soil gas diffusion model were employed to interpret our results. Starch storage and partly soil gas diffusion affected transfer times, but phloem path-length strongly controlled molecule transfer times. Successful modelling required substantially different phloem properties (higher specific conductivity and turgor pressure difference) in tall compared with small plants, which is significant for our understanding of tall trees' physiology. Finally, we compared isotopic and flux-based approaches for the determination of the link between canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration. We conclude that isotopic approaches are not well suited to document whether changes in photosynthesis of tall trees can rapidly affect soil respiration.",M2
19818760,"Enhanced metallothionein gene expression induced by mitochondrial oxidative stress is reduced in phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase-overexpressed cells.Mitochondria are major compartments in cells responsible for generating reactive oxygen species, which can cause the development of diabetes, Parkinson's disease and premature aging. Antioxidant systems in mitochondria are important for the prevention of diseases and reduction in the speed of aging. We investigated whether the reactive oxygen species generated in mitochondria induced the expression of metallothionein as an antioxidant. We compared the expression level of metallothionein mRNA in mitochondrial phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx)-overexpressed (PHGPx-ov) cells with that in control cells. These cells were treated with respiratory inhibitors, including rotenone and 2, 4-dinitrophenol; under these conditions, the PHGPx-ov cells were more resistant to cell death than the control cells. In addition, the intracellular reactive oxygen species level that was induced by these inhibitors was lower in PHGPx-ov cells than in control cells. This indicates that PHGPx degrades the membrane phospholipid hydroperoxide that is formed via the reactive oxygen species generated in mitochondria. The enhanced expression of metallothionein-I and metallothionein-II mRNA in rotenone-treated control cells was significantly decreased in rotenone-treated PHGPx-ov cells, suggesting that the hydrogen peroxide that is formed by superoxide anions generated in mitochondria diffuse into the cytosol and induce metallothionein mRNA expression. Conversely, the expression of manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) mRNA, which is localized in mitochondria, was not correlated with the intracellular reactive oxygen species level that was induced by rotenone treatment. These results suggest that metallothionein expression is sensitively and strictly regulated by the oxidative state that is induced by mitochondrial <e>respiration</e>.",M2
19815687,"Hypoxia-responsive microRNAs and trans-acting small interfering RNAs in Arabidopsis.Low-oxygen (hypoxia) stress associated with natural phenomena such as waterlogging, results in widespread transcriptome changes and a metabolic switch from aerobic <e>respiration</e> to anaerobic fermentation. High-throughput sequencing of small RNA libraries obtained from hypoxia-treated and control root tissue identified a total of 65 unique microRNA (miRNA) sequences from 46 families, and 14 trans-acting small interfering RNA (tasiRNA) from three families. Hypoxia resulted in changes to the abundance of 46 miRNAs from 19 families, and all three tasiRNA families. Chemical inhibition of mitochondrial respiration caused similar changes in expression in a majority of the hypoxia-responsive small RNAs analysed. Our data indicate that miRNAs and tasiRNAs play a role in gene regulation and possibly developmental responses to hypoxia, and that a major signal for these responses is likely to be dependent on mitochondrial function.",M2
19804813,"Regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis during myogenesis.Pathways involved in mitochondrial biogenesis associated with myogenic differentiation are poorly defined.

Mitochondrial <e>respiration</e>, citrate synthase- and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity as well as protein content of complexes I, II, III and V of the mitochondrial respiratory chain increased 4-8-fold during differentiation. Additionally, an increase in the ratio of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) slow vs MyHC fast protein content was observed. PPAR transcriptional activity and transcript levels of PPAR-alpha, the PPAR co-activator PGC-1alpha, mitochondrial transcription factor A and nuclear respiratory factor 1 increased during differentiation while expression levels of PPAR-gamma decreased. In conclusion, expression and activity levels of genes known for their regulatory role in skeletal muscle oxidative capabilities parallel the increase in oxidative parameters during the myogenic program. In particular, PGC-1alpha and PPAR-alpha may be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis during myogenesis.",M2
19804714,"Modeling cardiac action potential shortening driven by oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial oscillations in guinea pig cardiomyocytes.Ischemia-induced shortening of the cardiac action potential and its heterogeneous recovery upon reperfusion are thought to set the stage for reentrant arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We have recently reported that the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) through a mechanism triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS), coupled to the opening of sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels, contributes to electrical dysfunction during ischemia-reperfusion. Here we present a computational model of excitation-contraction coupling linked to mitochondrial bioenergetics that incorporates mitochondrial ROS-induced ROS release with coupling between the mitochondrial energy state and electrical excitability mediated by the sarcolemmal K(ATP) current (I(K,ATP)). Whole-cell model simulations demonstrate that increasing the fraction of oxygen diverted from the respiratory chain to ROS production triggers limit-cycle oscillations of DeltaPsi(m), redox potential, and mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> through the activation of a ROS-sensitive inner membrane anion channel. The periods of transient mitochondrial uncoupling decrease the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio and activate I(K,ATP), consequently shortening the cellular action potential duration and ultimately suppressing electrical excitability. The model simulates emergent behavior observed in cardiomyocytes subjected to metabolic stress and provides a new tool for examining how alterations in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation will impact the electrophysiological, contractile, and Ca(2+) handling properties of the cardiac cell. Moreover, the model is an important step toward building multiscale models that will permit investigation of the role of spatiotemporal heterogeneity of mitochondrial metabolism in the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis and contractile dysfunction in cardiac muscle.",M2

19799853,"Age-related deficiencies in complex I endogenous substrate availability and reserve capacity of complex IV in cortical neuron electron transport.Respiratory enzyme complex dysfunction is mechanistically involved in mitochondrial failure leading to neurodegenerative disease, but the pathway is unclear. Here, age-related differences in mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> were measured in both whole and permeabilized neurons from 9-month and 24-month adult rat cortex cultured in common conditions. After permeabilization, respiration increased in both ages of neurons with excess substrates. To dissect specific deficiencies in the respiratory chain, inhibitors for each respiratory chain complex were used to isolate their contributions. Relative to neurons from 9-month rats, in neurons isolated from 24-month rats, complexes I, III, and IV were more sensitive to selective inhibition. Flux control point analysis identified complex I in neurons isolated from 24-month rats as the most sensitive to endogenous substrate availability. The greatest age-related deficit in flux capacity occurred at complex IV with a 29% decrease in neurons isolated from 24-month rats relative to those from 9-month rats. The deficits in complexes I and III may contribute to a redox shift in the quinone pool within the electron transport chain, further extending these age-related deficits. Together these changes could lead to an age-related catastrophic decline in energy production and neuronal death.",M2
19793916,"Caspase-independent mitochondrial cell death results from loss of <e>respiration</e>, not cytotoxic protein release.In apoptosis, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) triggers caspase-dependent death. However, cells undergo clonogenic death even if caspases are blocked. One proposed mechanism involved the release of cytotoxic proteins (e.g., AIF and endoG) from mitochondria. To initiate MOMP directly without side effects, we created a tamoxifen-switchable BimS fusion protein. Surprisingly, even after MOMP, caspase-inhibited cells replicated DNA and divided for approximately 48 h before undergoing proliferation arrest. AIF and endoG remained in mitochondria. However, cells gradually lost mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, and DNA synthesis slowed to a halt by 72 h. These defects resulted from a partial loss of respiratory function, occurring 4-8 h after MOMP, that was not merely due to dispersion of cytochrome c. In particular, Complex I activity was completely lost, and Complex IV activity was reduced by approximately 70%, whereas Complex II was unaffected. Later, cells exhibited a more profound loss of mitochondrial protein constituents. Thus, under caspase inhibition, MOMP-induced clonogenic death results from a progressive loss of mitochondrial function, rather than the release of cytotoxic proteins from mitochondria.",M2

Bentazon is not readily adsorbed by soil and therefore it enters adjacent freshwater ecosystems, making its way to estuarine and marine waters areas. Information regarding its effects on marine ecosystems is scarce. Phytotoxicity assessments were conducted in the laboratory on the common diatom Chaetoceros gracilis using both the active ingredient and its formulated product (Basamaïs). The 3 day EC(50) using cell counts were, respectively, 150 mg/L and 60 microg/L for bentazon active ingredient and for bentazon-formulated while cellular volume was increased. Although bentazon is known as a photosystem II inhibitor, it produced an increase of pigment (chlorophylls a, c, and carotenoids) content, ATP synthesis, rates of photosynthesis and <e>respiration</e>, and TBARS formation. Therefore, pigments cannot be used as biomarkers of toxicity. Algal cell recovery from bentazon effects occurred after 6-9 days, suggesting a tolerance mechanism.",M2
19765231,"Apoplastic barriers effectively block oxygen permeability across outer cell layers of rice roots under deoxygenated conditions: roles of apoplastic pores and of <e>respiration</e>.*Despite the importance of the barrier to oxygen losses of the roots of hygrophytes growing in wet environments devoid of oxygen, there are few data available on permeability coefficients for O(2) across outer root cell layers (P(OPR)) and how they may change in response to low O(2). *A gas perfusion technique was used to measure the P(OPR) of rice (Oryza sativa) plants grown in either aerated or deoxygenated solution. The contributions of the apoplast and of living cells to the overall P(OPR) were characterized either by blocking apoplastic pores with precipitates of brown Cu(2)[Fe(CN)(6)] or by killing cells with 0.1 N HCl. *Compared with that of plants from aerated hydroponics, the P(OPR) of plants grown in deoxygenated medium was smaller by an order of magnitude. Precipitates resulting from CuSO(4)/K(4)[Fe(CN)(6)] treatment only formed in plants grown in aerated solution, where they reduced the P(OPR) by 5-20%. Killing of root segments with HCl increased P(OPR) in plants grown in both conditions by 20-55%. *The results indicated that apoplastic barriers effectively restricted radial O(2) loss. The relative role of the respiratory O(2) consumption of root peripheral layers increased as P(OPR) decreased.",M2
19754040,"Proteomic analysis reveals a synergistic mechanism of fluconazole and berberine against fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans: endogenous ROS augmentation.Our previous study showed that concomitant use of berberine (BBR) and fluconazole (FLC) provided a synergistic action against FLC-resistant Candida albicans (C. albicans) clinical strains in vitro. To clarify the mechanism underlying this action, we performed a comparative proteomic study in untreated control cells and cells treated with FLC and/or BBR in 2 clinical strains of C. albicans resistant to FLC. Our analyses identified 16 differentially expressed proteins, most of which were related to energy metabolisms (e.g., Gap1, Adh1, and Aco1). Functional analyses revealed that FLC + BBR treatment increased mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased intracellular ATP level, inhibited ATP-synthase activity, and increased generation of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in FLC-resistant strains. In addition, checkerboard microdilution assay showed that addition of antioxidant ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione reduced the synergistic antifungal activity of FLC + BBR significantly. These results suggest that mitochondrial aerobic <e>respiration</e> shift and endogenous ROS augmentation contribute to the synergistic action of FLC + BBR against FLC-resistant C. albicans.",M2
19751739,"Preservation of mitochondrial function with cardiopulmonary resuscitation in prolonged cardiac arrest in rats.During cardiac arrest (CA), myocardial perfusion is solely dependent on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) although closed-chest compressions only provide about 10-20% of normal myocardial perfusion. The study was conducted in a whole animal CPR model to determine whether CPR-generated oxygen delivery preserves or worsens mitochondrial function. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (400-450 g) were randomly divided into four groups: (1) BL (instrumentation only, no cardiac arrest), (2) CA(15) (15 min cardiac arrest without CPR), (3) CA(25) (25 min cardiac arrest without CPR) and (4) CPR (15 min cardiac arrest, followed by 10 min CPR). The differences between groups were evaluated by measuring mitochondrial <e>respiration</e>, electron transport chain (ETC) complex activities and mitochondrial ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The CA(25) group had the greatest impairment of mitochondrial respiration and ETC complex activities (I-III). In contrast, the CPR group was not different from the CA(15) group regarding all measures of mitochondrial function. Complex I was more susceptible to ischemic injury than the other complexes and was the major determinant of mitochondrial dysfunction. Observations of mitochondrial ultrastructure by TEM were compatible with the biochemical results. The findings suggest that, despite low blood flow and oxygen delivery, CPR is able to preserve heart mitochondrial function and viability during ongoing global ischemia. Preservation of complex I activity and mitochondrial function during cardiac arrest may be an important mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of CPR which have been shown in clinical studies.",M2
19744167,"Hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha induction by tumour necrosis factor-alpha, but not by toll-like receptor agonists, modulates cellular <e>respiration</e> in cultured human hepatocytes.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Genes encoding for some of the mitochondrial proteins are under the control of the transcriptional factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), which can accumulate under normoxic conditions in inflammatory states. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cobalt chloride (CoCl(2), a hypoxia mimicking agent), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and toll-like receptor (TLR) -2, -3 and -4 agonists on HIF-1 alpha accumulation, and further on HIF-1 alpha-mediated modulation of mitochondrial respiration in cultured human hepatocytes. METHODS: The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was used in this study. Cells were treated with CoCl(2), TNF-alpha and TLR-2, -3 and -4 agonists. HIF-1 alpha was determined by Western blotting and mitochondrial respiration in stimulated cells by high-resolution respirometry. RESULTS: CoCl(2), TNF-alpha and TLR agonists induced the expression of HIF-1 alpha in a time-dependent fashion. TNF-alpha and CoCl(2), but not TLR agonists, induced a reduction in complex I-, II- and IV-dependent mitochondrial oxygen consumption. TNF-alpha-associated reduction of cellular oxygen consumption was abolished through inhibition of HIF-1 alpha activity by chetomin (CTM). Pretreatment with cyclosporine A prevented CoCl(2)-induced reduction of complex I- and II-dependent mitochondrial oxygen consumption and TNF-alpha-induced reduction of complex-I-dependent respiration, implicating the involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore openings. TNF-alpha and TLR-2, -3 and -4 agonists induced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, which was partially abolished by the blockage of HIF-1 alpha with CTM. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that HIF-1 alpha modulates mitochondrial respiration during CoCl(2) and TNF-alpha stimulation, whereas it has no effect when induced with TLR-2, -3 and -4 agonists.",M2
19712747,"Bioenergetics of lung tumors: alteration of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory capacity.Little is known on the metabolic profile of lung tumors and the reminiscence of embryonic features. Herein, we determined the bioenergetic profiles of human fibroblasts taken from lung epidermoid carcinoma (HLF-a) and fetal lung (MRC5). We also analysed human lung tumors and their surrounding healthy tissue from four patients with adenocarcinoma. On these different models, we measured functional parameters (cell growth rates in oxidative and glycolytic media, <e>respiration</e>, ATP synthesis and PDH activity) as well as compositional features (expression level of various energy proteins and upstream transcription factors). The results demonstrate that both the lung fetal and cancer cell lines produced their ATP predominantly by glycolysis, while oxidative phosphorylation was only capable of poor ATP delivery. This was explained by a decreased mitochondrial biogenesis caused by a lowered expression of PGC1alpha (as shown by RT-PCR and Western blot) and mtTFA. Consequently, the relative expression of glycolytic versus OXPHOS markers was high in these cells. Moreover, the re-activation of mitochondrial biogenesis with resveratrol induced cell death specifically in cancer cells. A consistent reduction of mitochondrial biogenesis and the subsequent alteration of respiratory capacity was also observed in lung tumors, associated with a lower expression level of bcl2. Our data give a better characterization of lung cancer cells' metabolic alterations which are essential for growth and survival. They designate mitochondrial biogenesis as a possible target for anti-cancer therapy.",M2
19710539,"UCP3 expression in liver modulates gene expression and oxidative metabolism in response to fatty acids, and sensitizes mitochondria to permeability transition.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) is expressed in liver only under conditions of high fatty acid catabolism. However, the specific role of UCP3 in liver mitochondria and overall hepatic function is still poorly known. METHODS: A model of  in vivo  induction of UCP3 expression in mouse liver mitochondria via a tail-vein injection of a recombinant adenoviral vector was developed. The effects on liver mitochondrial bioenergetics and permeability transition, liver gene expression, and systemic metabolism were then determined. RESULTS: UCP3 expression in liver did not cause basal, non-specific, uncoupling but led to a stimulation of palmitate-induced state 4 <e>respiration</e>. UCP3 expression in liver also caused an increase in the expression of certain genes involved in lipid catabolism and metabolic response to starvation (e.g. medium chain acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1alpha). UCP3 also conferred to liver mitochondria an enhanced sensitivity to classical inducers of permeability transition, such as calcium and carboxyatractylate. CONCLUSION: UCP3 expression in liver exerts direct actions on mitochondrial activity, favoring fatty acid-induced uncoupling and sensitizing mitochondria to permeability transition, as well as causing retrograde signaling to nuclear gene expression consistent with favoring lipid catabolism and oxidative metabolism.",M2
19710360,"Negative feedback maintenance of heme homeostasis by its receptor, Rev-erbalpha.Intracellular heme levels must be tightly regulated to maintain proper mitochondrial <e>respiration</e> while minimizing toxicity, but the homeostatic mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report a novel negative feedback mechanism whereby the nuclear heme receptor Rev-erbalpha tightly controls the level of its own ligand. Heme binding to Rev-erbalpha recruits the NCoR/histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) corepressor complex to repress the transcription of the coactivator PGC-1alpha, a potent inducer of heme synthesis. Depletion of Rev-erbalpha derepresses PGC-1alpha, resulting in increased heme levels. Conversely, increased Rev-erbalpha reduces intracellular heme, and impairs mitochondrial respiration in a heme-dependent manner. Consistent with this bioenergetic impairment, overexpression of Rev-erbalpha dramatically inhibits cell growth due to a cell cycle arrest. Thus, Rev-erbalpha modulates the synthesis of its own ligand in a negative feedback pathway that maintains heme levels and regulates cellular energy metabolism.",M2
19703463,"Dietary omega-3 fatty acids alter cardiac mitochondrial phospholipid composition and delay Ca2+-induced permeability transition.Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), decreases risk for heart failure and attenuates pathologic cardiac remodeling in response to pressure overload. Dietary supplementation with EPA + DHA may also impact cardiac mitochondrial function and energetics through alteration of membrane phospholipids. We assessed the role of EPA + DHA supplementation on left ventricular (LV) function, cardiac mitochondrial membrane phospholipid composition, <e>respiration</e>, and sensitivity to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening in normal and infarcted myocardium. Rats were subjected to sham surgery or myocardial infarction by coronary artery ligation (n=10-14), and fed a standard diet, or supplemented with EPA + DHA (2.3% of energy intake) for 12 weeks. EPA + DHA altered fatty acid composition of total mitochondrial phospholipids and cardiolipin by reducing arachidonic acid content and increasing DHA incorporation. EPA + DHA significantly increased calcium uptake capacity in both subsarcolemmal and intrafibrillar mitochondria from sham rats. This treatment effect persisted with the addition of cyclosporin A, and was not accompanied by changes in mitochondrial respiration or coupling, or cyclophilin D protein expression. Myocardial infarction resulted in heart failure as evidenced by LV dilation and contractile dysfunction. Infarcted LV myocardium had decreased mitochondrial protein yield and activity of mitochondrial marker enzymes, however respiratory function of isolated mitochondria was normal. EPA + DHA had no effect on LV function, mitochondrial respiration, or MPTP opening in rats with heart failure. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with EPA + DHA altered mitochondrial membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition in normal and infarcted hearts, but delayed MPTP opening only in normal hearts.",M2
19697348,"Human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells differentiate into functional brown adipocytes.In contrast to the earlier contention, adult humans have been shown recently to possess active brown adipose tissue with a potential of being of metabolic significance. Up to now, brown fat precursor cells have not been available for human studies. We have shown previously that human multipotent adipose-derived stem (hMADS) cells exhibit a normal karyotype and high self-renewal ability; they are known to differentiate into cells that exhibit the key properties of human white adipocytes, that is, uncoupling protein two expression, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, lipolysis in response to beta-agonists and atrial natriuretic peptide, and release of adiponectin and leptin. Herein, we show that, upon chronic exposure to a specific PPARgamma but not to a PPARbeta/delta or a PPARalpha agonist, hMADS cell-derived white adipocytes are able to switch to a brown phenotype by expressing both uncoupling protein one (UCP1) and CIDEA mRNA. This switch is accompanied by an increase in oxygen consumption and uncoupling. The expression of UCP1 protein is associated to stimulation of <e>respiration</e> by beta-AR agonists, including beta3-AR agonist. Thus, hMADS cells represent an invaluable cell model to screen for drugs stimulating the formation and/or the uncoupling capacity of human brown adipocytes that could help to dissipate excess caloric intake of individuals.",M2
19694965,"Fine-root mortality rates in a temperate forest: estimates using radiocarbon data and numerical modeling.* We used an inadvertent whole-ecosystem 14C label at a temperate forest in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA to develop a model (Radix1.0) of fine-root dynamics. Radix simulates two live-root pools, two dead-root pools, non-normally distributed root mortality turnover times, a stored carbon (C) pool, and seasonal growth and <e>respiration</e> patterns. * We applied Radix to analyze measurements from two root size classes (&lt; 0.5 and 0.5-2.0 mm diameter) and three soil-depth increments (O horizon, 0-15 cm and 30-60 cm). * Predicted live-root turnover times were &lt; 1 yr and approximately 10 yr for short- and long-lived pools, respectively. Dead-root pools had decomposition turnover times of approximately 2 yr and approximately 10 yr. Realistic characterization of C flows through fine roots requires a model with two live fine-root populations, two dead fine-root pools, and root respiration. These are the first fine-root turnover time estimates that take into account respiration, storage, seasonal growth patterns, and non-normal turnover time distributions. * The presence of a root population with decadal turnover times implies a lower amount of belowground net primary production used to grow fine-root tissue than is currently predicted by models with a single annual turnover pool.",M2
19675153,"Remodeled <e>respiration</e> in ndufs4 with low phosphorylation efficiency suppresses Arabidopsis germination and growth and alters control of metabolism at night.Respiratory oxidative phosphorylation is a cornerstone of cellular metabolism in aerobic multicellular organisms. The efficiency of this process is generally assumed to be maximized, but the presence of dynamically regulated nonphosphorylating bypasses implies that plants can alter phosphorylation efficiency and can benefit from lowered energy generation during respiration under certain conditions. We characterized an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant, ndufs4 (for NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] fragment S subunit 4), lacking complex I of the respiratory chain, which has constitutively lowered phosphorylation efficiency. Through analysis of the changes to mitochondrial function as well as whole cell transcripts and metabolites, we provide insights into how cellular metabolism flexibly adapts to reduced phosphorylation efficiency and why this state may benefit the plant by providing moderate stress tolerance. We show that removal of the single protein subunit NDUFS4 prevents assembly of complex I and removes its function from mitochondria without pleiotropic effects on other respiratory components. However, the lack of complex I promotes broad changes in the nuclear transcriptome governing growth and photosynthetic function. We observed increases in organic acid and amino acid pools in the mutant, especially at night, concomitant with alteration of the adenylate content. While germination is delayed, this can be rescued by application of gibberellic acid, and root growth assays of seedlings show enhanced tolerance to cold, mild salt, and osmotic stress. We discuss these observations in the light of recent data on the knockout of nonphosphorylating respiratory bypass enzymes that show opposite changes in metabolites and stress sensitivity. Our data suggest that the absence of complex I alters the adenylate control of cellular metabolism.",M2
19675152,"In folio respiratory fluxomics revealed by 13C isotopic labeling and H/D isotope effects highlight the noncyclic nature of the tricarboxylic acid  cycle  in illuminated leaves.While the possible importance of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle reactions for leaf photosynthesis operation has been recognized, many uncertainties remain on whether TCA cycle biochemistry is similar in the light compared with the dark. It is widely accepted that leaf day <e>respiration</e> and the metabolic commitment to TCA decarboxylation are down-regulated in illuminated leaves. However, the metabolic basis (i.e. the limiting steps involved in such a down-regulation) is not well known. Here, we investigated the in vivo metabolic fluxes of individual reactions of the TCA cycle by developing two isotopic methods, (13)C tracing and fluxomics and the use of H/D isotope effects, with Xanthium strumarium leaves. We provide evidence that the TCA  cycle  does not work in the forward direction like a proper cycle but, rather, operates in both the reverse and forward directions to produce fumarate and glutamate, respectively. Such a functional division of the cycle plausibly reflects the compromise between two contrasted forces: (1) the feedback inhibition by NADH and ATP on TCA enzymes in the light, and (2) the need to provide pH-buffering organic acids and carbon skeletons for nitrate absorption and assimilation.",M2
19674328,"Root-derived CO(2) efflux via xylem stream rivals soil CO(2) efflux.<e>Respiration</e> consumes a large portion of annual gross primary productivity in forest ecosystems and is dominated by belowground metabolism. Here, we present evidence of a previously unaccounted for internal CO(2) flux of large magnitude from tree roots through stems. If this pattern is shown to persist over time and in other forests, it suggests that belowground respiration has been grossly underestimated. Using an experimental Populus deltoides plantation as a model system, we tested the hypothesis that a substantial portion of the CO(2) released from belowground autotrophic respiration remains within tree root systems and is transported aboveground through the xylem stream rather than diffusing into the soil atmosphere. On a daily basis, the amount of CO(2) that moved upward from the root system into the stem via the xylem stream (0.26 mol CO(2) m(-2) d(-1)) rivalled that which diffused from the soil surface to the atmosphere (0.27 mol CO(2) m(-2) d(-1)). We estimated that twice the amount of CO(2) derived from belowground autotrophic respiration entered the xylem stream as diffused into the soil environment. Our observations indicate that belowground autotrophic respiration consumes substantially more carbohydrates than previously recognized and challenge the paradigm that all root-respired CO(2) diffuses into the soil atmosphere.",M2
19671094,"Plastic and adaptive responses of plant <e>respiration</e> to changes in atmospheric CO(2) concentration.The concentration of atmospheric CO2 has increased from below 200 microl l(-1) during last glacial maximum in the late Pleistocene to near 280 microl l(-1) at the beginning of the Holocene and has continuously increased since the onset of the industrial revolution. Most responses of plants to increasing atmospheric CO2 levels result in increases in photosynthesis, water use efficiency and biomass. Less known is the role that respiration may play during adaptive responses of plants to changes in atmospheric CO2. Although plant respiration does not increase proportionally with CO2-enhanced photosynthesis or growth rates, a reduction in respiratory costs in plants grown at subambient CO2 can aid in maintaining a positive plant C-balance (i.e. enhancing the photosynthesis-to-respiration ratio). The understanding of plant respiration is further complicated by the presence of the alternative pathway that consumes photosynthate without producing chemical energy [adenosine triphosphate (ATP)] as effectively as respiration through the normal cytochrome pathway. Here, we present the respiratory responses of Arabidopsis thaliana plants selected at Pleistocene (200 microl l(-1)), current Holocene (370 microl l(-1)), and elevated (700 microl l(-1)) concentrations of CO2 and grown at current CO2 levels. We found that respiration rates were lower in Pleistocene-adapted plants when compared with Holocene ones, and that a substantial reduction in respiration was because of reduced activity of the alternative pathway. In a survey of the literature, we found that changes in respiration across plant growth forms and CO2 levels can be explained in part by differences in the respiratory energy demand for maintenance of biomass. This trend was substantiated in the Arabidopsis experiment in which Pleistocene-adapted plants exhibited decreases in respiration without concurrent reductions in tissue N content. Interestingly, N-based respiration rates of plants adapted to elevated CO2 also decreased. As a result, ATP yields per unit of N increased in Pleistocene-adapted plants compared with current CO2 adapted ones. Our results suggest that mitochondrial energy coupling and alternative pathway-mediated responses of respiration to changes in atmospheric CO2 may enhance survival of plants at low CO2 levels to help overcome a low carbon balance. Therefore, increases in the basal activity of the alternative pathway are not necessarily associated to metabolic plant stress in all cases.",M2
19657102,"Control of <e>respiration</e> in flight muscle from the high-altitude bar-headed goose and low-altitude birds.Bar-headed geese fly at altitudes of up to 9,000 m on their biannual migration over the Himalayas. To determine whether the flight muscle of this species has evolved to facilitate exercise at high altitude, we compared the respiratory properties of permeabilized muscle fibers from bar-headed geese and several low-altitude waterfowl species. Respiratory capacities were assessed for maximal ADP stimulation (with single or multiple inputs to the electron transport system) and cytochrome oxidase excess capacity (with an exogenous electron donor) and were generally 20-40% higher in bar-headed geese when creatine was present. When respiration rates were extrapolated to the entire pectoral muscle mass, bar-headed geese had a higher mass-specific aerobic capacity. This may represent a surplus capacity that counteracts the depressive effects of hypoxia on mitochondrial respiration. However, there were no differences in activity for mitochondrial or glycolytic enzymes measured in homogenized muscle. The [ADP] leading to half-maximal stimulation (K(m)) was approximately twofold higher in bar-headed geese (10 vs. 4-6 microM), and, while creatine reduced K(m) by 30% in this species, it had no effect on K(m) in low-altitude birds. Mitochondrial creatine kinase may therefore contribute to the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in flight muscle of bar-headed geese, which could promote efficient coupling of ATP supply and demand. However, this was not based on differences in creatine kinase activity in isolated mitochondria or homogenized muscle. The unique differences in bar-headed geese existed without prior exercise or hypoxia exposure and were not a result of phylogenetic history, and may, therefore, be important evolutionary specializations for high-altitude flight.",M2
19657095,"MitoQ administration prevents endotoxin-induced cardiac dysfunction.Sepsis elicits severe alterations in cardiac function, impairing cardiac mitochondrial and pressure-generating capacity. Currently, there are no therapies to prevent sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. We tested the hypothesis that administration of a mitochondrially targeted antioxidant, 10-(6'-ubiquinonyl)-decyltriphenylphosphonium (MitoQ), would prevent endotoxin-induced reductions in cardiac mitochondrial and contractile function. Studies were performed on adult rodents (n = 52) given either saline, endotoxin (8 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), saline + MitoQ (500 microM), or both endotoxin and MitoQ. At 48 h animals were killed and hearts were removed for determination of either cardiac mitochondrial function (using polarography) or cardiac pressure generation (using the Langendorf technique). We found that endotoxin induced reductions in mitochondrial state 3 <e>respiration</e> rates, the respiratory control ratio, and ATP generation. Moreover, MitoQ administration prevented each of these endotoxin-induced abnormalities, P &lt; 0.001. We also found that endotoxin produced reductions in cardiac pressure-generating capacity, reducing the systolic pressure-diastolic relationship. MitoQ also prevented endotoxin-induced reductions in cardiac pressure generation, P &lt; 0.01. One potential link between mitochondrial and contractile dysfunction is caspase activation; we found that endotoxin increased cardiac levels of active caspases 9 and 3 (P &lt; 0.001), while MitoQ prevented this increase (P &lt; 0.01). These data demonstrate that MitoQ is a potent inhibitor of endotoxin-induced mitochondrial and cardiac abnormalities. We speculate that this agent may prove a novel therapy for sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction.",M2

Soil CO2 efflux was not affected by pressure effects during respiration measurements. The labelling kinetics of respiratory CO2 measured in the field agreed with that of excised soil + vegetation blocks measured in a laboratory-based system. The kinetics fitted a two-source system (r(2) = 0.97), with a rapidly labelled source (half-life 2.6 d) supplying 48% of respiration, and the other source (52%) releasing no tracer during 14 d of labelling. * Of the two sources supplying ecosystem respiration, one was closely connected to current photosynthesis (approximately autotrophic respiration) and the other was provided by decomposition of structural plant biomass (approximately heterotrophic respiration).",M2
19653200,"(13)C/(12)C isotope labeling to study carbon partitioning and dark <e>respiration</e> in cereals subjected to water stress.Despite the relevance of carbon (C) loss through respiration processes (with its consequent effect on the lower C availability for grain filling), little attention has been given to this topic. Literature data concerning the role of respiration in cereals are scarce and these have been produced using indirect methods based on gas-exchange estimations. We have developed a new method based on the capture of respired CO(2) samples and their analysis by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). In order to analyse the main processes involved in the C balance during grain filling (photosynthesis, respiration, allocation and partitioning) the ambient isotopic (13)C/(12)C composition (delta(13)C) of the growth chamber was modified during this period (delta(13)C ca. -12.8 +/- 0.3 per thousand to ca. -20.0 +/- 0.2 per thousand). The physiological performance, together with the C allocation on total organic matter (TOM) and respiration of wheat (Triticum aestivum L., var. Califa sur) and two hybrids, tritordeum (X Tritordeum Asch. &amp; Graebn line HT 621) and triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack var. Imperioso), were compared during post-anthesis water stress. In spite of the larger ear DM/total ratio, especially under drought conditions, the grain filling of triticale and wheat was mainly carried out with pre-anthesis C, while the majority of C assimilated during post-anthesis was invested in respiration processes. In the case of wheat and tritordeum, the C balance data suggested a reallocation during grain filling of photoassimilates stored prior to anthesis from shoot to ear. Furthermore, the lower percentage of labeled C on respired CO(2) of droughted tritordeum plants, together with the lower plant biomass, explained the fact that those plants had more C available for grain filling.",M2
19648018,"Overexpression of endoplasmic reticulum omega-3 fatty acid desaturase gene improves chilling tolerance in tomato.An endoplasmic reticulum-localized tomato omega-3 fatty acid desaturase gene (LeFAD3) was isolated and characterized with regard to its sequence, response to various temperatures and function in transgenic tomato plants. Northern blot analysis showed that LeFAD3 was expressed in all organs tested and was markedly abundant in roots. Meanwhile, the expression of LeFAD3 was induced by chilling stress (4 degrees C), but inhibited by high temperature (40 degrees C). The transgenic plants were obtained under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (35S-CaMV). Northern and western blot analyses confirmed that sense LeFAD3 was transferred into tomato genome and overexpressed. Level of linolenic acids (18:3) increased and correspondingly level of linoleic acid (18:2) decreased in leaves and roots. After chilling stress, the fresh weight of the aerial parts of transgenic plants was higher than that of the wild type (WT) plants, and the membrane system ultrastructure of chloroplast in leaf cell and all the subcellular organelles in root tips of transgenic plants kept more intact than those of WT. Relative electric conductivity increased less in transgenic plants than that in WT, and the <e>respiration</e> rate of the transgenic plants was notably higher than that of WT. The maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (F(v)/F(m)) and the O(2) evolution rate in WT decreased more than those in transgenic plants under chilling stress.

Swelling, state 4, state 3, and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP)-stimulated respiration as well as the membrane potential (DeltaPsi(mito)) of rat liver mitochondria were studied in media containing 0-75 mM TlNO(3) either with 250 mM sucrose or with 125 mM nitrate salts of other monovalent cations (KNO(3), or NaNO(3), or NH(4)NO(3)). Tl(+) increased permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to K(+), Na(+), and H(+), that was manifested as stimulation of the swelling of nonenergized and energized mitochondria as well as via an increase of state 4 and dissipation of DeltaPsi(mito). These effects of Tl(+) increased in the order of sucrose &lt;K(+) &lt;Na(+) &lt;or= NH(4)(+). They were stimulated by inorganic phosphate and decreased by ADP, Mg(2+), and cyclosporine A. Contraction of energized mitochondria, swollen in the nitrate media, was markedly inhibited by quinine. It suggests participation of the mitochondrial K(+)/H(+) exchanger in extruding of Tl(+)-induced excess of univalent cations from the mitochondrial matrix. It is discussed that Tl(+) (like Cd(2+) and other heavy metals) increases the ion permeability of the inner membrane of mitochondria regardless of their energization and stimulates the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in low conductance state. The observed decrease of state 3 and DNP-stimulated respiration in the nitrate media resulted from the mitochondrial swelling rather than from an inhibition of respiratory enzymes as is the case with the bivalent heavy metals.",M2

We hypothesized that increased oxidative stress could cause mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle and make contribution to exercise intolerance in diabetes. C57/BL6J mice were fed on normal diet or high fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk to induce obesity with insulin resistance and diabetes. Treadmill tests with expired gas analysis were performed to determine the exercise capacity and whole body oxygen uptake (Vo(2)). The work (vertical distance x body weight) to exhaustion was reduced in the HFD mice by 36%, accompanied by a 16% decrease of peak Vo(2). Mitochondrial ADP-stimulated respiration, electron transport chain complex I and III activities, and mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle were decreased in the HFD mice. Furthermore, superoxide production and NAD(P)H oxidase activity in skeletal muscle were significantly increased in the HFD mice. Intriguingly, the treatment of HFD-fed mice with apocynin [10 mmol/l; an inhibitor of NAD(P)H oxidase activation] improved exercise intolerance and mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle without affecting glucose metabolism itself. The exercise capacity and mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle were impaired in type 2 diabetes, which might be due to enhanced oxidative stress. Therapies designed to regulate oxidative stress and maintain mitochondrial function could be beneficial to improve the exercise capacity in type 2 diabetes.",M2
19617393,"Downregulation of mitochondrial porin inhibits cell growth and alters respiratory phenotype in Trypanosoma brucei.Porin is the most abundant outer membrane (OM) protein of mitochondria. It forms the aqueous channel on the mitochondrial OM and mediates major metabolite flux between mitochondria and cytosol. Mitochondrial porin in Trypanosoma brucei, a unicellular parasitic protozoan and the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, possesses a beta-barrel structure similar to the bacterial OM porin OmpA. T. brucei porin (TbPorin) is present as a monomer as well as an oligomer on the mitochondrial OM, and its expression is developmentally regulated. In spite of its distinct structure, the TbPorin function is similar to those of other eukaryotic porins. TbPorin RNA interference (RNAi) reduced cell growth in both procyclic and bloodstream forms. The depletion of TbPorin decreased ATP production by inhibiting metabolite flux through the OM. Additionally, the level of trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO) decreased, whereas the levels of cytochrome-dependent respiratory complexes III and IV increased in TbPorin-depleted mitochondria. Furthermore, the depletion of TbPorin reduced cellular <e>respiration</e> via TAO, which is not coupled with oxidative phosphorylation, but increased the capacity for cyanide-sensitive respiration. Together, these data reveal that TbPorin knockdown reduced the mitochondrial ATP level, which in turn increased the capacity of the cytochrome-dependent respiratory pathway (CP), in an attempt to compensate for the mitochondrial energy crisis. However, a simultaneous decrease in the substrate-level phosphorylation due to TbPorin RNAi caused growth inhibition in the procyclic form. We also found that the expressions of TAO and CP proteins are coordinately regulated in T. brucei according to mitochondrial energy demand.",M2
19603262,"Effects of endotoxin and catecholamines on hepatic mitochondrial <e>respiration</e>.Catecholamines are frequently used in sepsis, but their interaction with mitochondrial function is controversial. We incubated isolated native and endotoxin-exposed swine liver mitochondria with either dopamine, dobutamine, noradrenaline or placebo for 1 h. Mitochondrial State 3 and 4 respiration and their ratio (RCR) were determined for respiratory chain complexes I, II and IV. All catecholamines impaired glutamate-dependent RCR (p = 0.046), predominantly in native mitochondria. Endotoxin incubation alone induced a decrease in glutamate-dependent RCR compared to control samples (p = 0.002). We conclude that catecholamines and endotoxin impair the efficiency of mitochondrial complex I respiration in vitro.",M2
19597848,"Solar ultraviolet radiation alters alder and birch litter chemistry that in turn affects decomposers and soil <e>respiration</e>.Solar ultraviolet (UV)-A and UV-B radiation were excluded from branches of grey alder (Alnus incana) and white birch (Betula pubescens) trees in a field experiment. Leaf litter collected from these trees was used in microcosm experiments under laboratory conditions. The aim was to evaluate the effects of the different UV treatments on litter chemical quality (phenolic compounds, C, N and lignin) and the subsequent effects of these changes on soil fauna and decomposition processes. We measured the decomposition rate of litter, growth of woodlice (Porcellio scaber), soil microbial respiration and abundance of nematodes and enchytraeid worms. In addition, the chemical quality of woodlice feces was analyzed. The exclusion of both UV-A and UV-B had several effects on litter chemistry. Exclusion of UV-B radiation decreased the C content in litter in both tree species. In alder litter, UV exclusion affected concentration of phenolic groups variably, whereas in birch litter there were no significant differences in phenolic compounds. Moreover, further effects on microbial respiration and chemical quality of woodlice feces were apparent. In both tree species, microbial CO(2) evolution was lower in soil with litter produced under exclusion of both UV-A and UV-B radiation when compared to soil with control litter. The N content was higher in the feces of woodlice eating alder litter produced under exclusion of both UV-A and UV-B compared to the control. In addition, there were small changes in the concentration of individual phenolic compounds analyzed from woodlice feces. Our results demonstrate that both UV-A and UV-B alter litter chemistry which in turn affects decomposition processes.",M2
19584128,"Floral thermogenesis of three species of Hydnora (Hydnoraceae) in Africa.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Floral thermogenesis occurs in at least 12 families of ancient seed plants. Some species show very high rates of <e>respiration</e> through the alternative pathway, and some are thermoregulatory, with increasing respiration at decreasing ambient temperature. This study assesses the intensity and regulation of respiration in three species of African Hydnora that represent the Hydnoraceae, an unusual family of holoparasitic plants from arid environments. METHODS: Long-term respirometry (CO(2) production) and thermometry were carried out on intact flowers of H. africana, H. abyssinica and H. esculenta in the field, and short-term measurements were made on floral parts during the protogynous flowering sequence. KEY RESULTS: For H. africana, there was no temperature elevation in either the osmophores or the gynoecial chamber in any phase, and mass-specific respiration rates of the flower parts were low (maximum 8.3 nmol CO(2) g(-1) s(-1) in osmophore tissue). Respiration tracked ambient and floral temperatures, eliminating the possibility of the inverse relationship expected in thermoregulatory flowers. Hydnora abyssinica flowers had higher respiration (maximum 27.5 nmol g(-1) s(-1) in the osmophores) and a slight elevation of osmophore temperature (maximum 2.8 degrees C) in the female stage. Respiration by gynoecial tissue was similar to that of osmophores in both species, but there was no measurable elevation of gynoecial chamber temperature. Gynoecial chamber temperature of H. esculenta could reach 3.8 degrees C above ambient, but there are no respiration data available. Antheral tissue respiration was maximal in the male phase (4.8 nmol g(-1) s(-1) in H. africana and 10.3 nmol g(-1) s(-1) in H. abyssinica), but it did not raise the antheral ring temperature, which showed that thermogenesis is not a by-product of pollen maturation or release. CONCLUSIONS: The exceptionally low thermogenesis in Hydnora appears to be associated with scent production and possibly gynoecial development, but has little direct benefit to beetle pollinators.",M2
19579953,"Sugar regulation of plastid reversion in citrus epicarp is mediated through organic acid metabolism.The inhibition by sucrose of chromoplast reversion to chloroplast in citrus epicarp was studied by observing the effects of several sugars, sugar metabolites and 1-iodoacetate on chlorophyll reaccumulation in cultured Citrus paradisi Macf. pericarp segments. Pericarp segments of 1 cm in diameter were cut from yellow fruits and cultured on modified medium plus the indicated metabolites and kept under continuous fluorescent light. Accumulation of chlorophyll in the segments was measured with a spectrophotometer fitted with sphere reflectometer. <e>Respiration</e> was determined via., an infrared gas analyzer. Inhibition of regreening was not specific to a particular sugar. The organic acids malate, citrate, succinate, 2-oxoglutarate and especially malonate elicited effects similar to sucrose, but at much lower concentrations. However, malonate inhibition of chlorophyll accumulation was overcome by increased concentrations of glutamine. At concentrations that usually inhibited chlorophyll, malonate did not reduce CO2 production in the presence of glutamine or KNO3. Sucrose effects on regreening were reduced by 1-iodoacetate. These results indicate that sugar regulation of plastid reversion during regreening in citrus epicarp is not directly due to sugars, but is instead mediated through metabolism of sugars to organic acids, especially malonic acid.",M2
19567377,"Differential gene expression profiles of the mitochondrial respiratory components in illuminated Arabidopsis leaves.Plant mitochondria have multiple energy-dissipating components in the respiratory chain. It is known that these components are induced under several stress conditions. Here we examined whether the gene expression pattern and its regulatory mechanism under high light (HL) conditions are different among the respiratory components in Arabidopsis leaves. Alternative oxidase (AOX) gene expression (AOX1a and AOX1c) and amount of protein were elevated after exposure to HL. In addition to AOX, the expression of other respiratory genes, including NDA1, NDB2, NDC1, UCP1, UCP5, COX6b and CI76, was also induced by HL. NDB2 was co-expressed with AOX1a, but other HL-induced genes showed a distinct expression pattern. Manipulation of photosynthesis or <e>respiration</e> using several chemicals revealed that while the expression of AOX1a and NDB2 was mainly induced by inhibition of the respiratory chain, NDA1 expression was affected by photosynthesis-related reactive oxygen species. The expression of AOX1c, NDC1, COX6b and CI76 was not induced by these manipulations. When plants were exposed to HL under a high CO(2) environment, the expression of several respiratory genes was more strongly induced, suggesting that modulations of cellular carbon status by elevated photosynthesis are involved in respiratory gene expression. Based on these results, we propose a mechanistic model of respiratory gene expression in illuminated leaves.",M2
19602545,"Assimilation of xylem-transported 13C-labelled CO2 in leaves and branches of sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.).Previous reports have shown that CO(2) dissolved in xylem sap in tree stems can move upward in the transpiration stream. To determine the fate of this dissolved CO(2), the internal transport of respired CO(2) at high concentration from the bole of the tree was simulated by allowing detached young branches of sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.) to transpire water enriched with a known quantity of (13)CO(2) in sunlight. Simultaneously, leaf net photosynthesis and CO(2) efflux from woody tissue were measured. Branch and leaf tissues were subsequently analysed for (13)C content to determine the quantity of transported (13)CO(2) label that was fixed. Treatment branches assimilated an average of 35% (SE=2.4) of the (13)CO(2) label taken up in the treatment water. The majority was fixed in the woody tissue of the branches, with smaller amounts fixed in the leaves and petioles. Overall, the fixation of internally transported (13)CO(2) label by woody tissues averaged 6% of the assimilation of CO(2) from the atmosphere by the leaves. Woody tissue assimilation rates calculated from measurements of (13)C differed from rates calculated from measurements of CO(2) efflux in the lower branch but not in the upper branch. The results of this study showed unequivocally that CO(2) transported in xylem sap can be fixed in photosynthetic cells in the leaves and branches of sycamore trees and provided evidence that recycling of xylem-transported CO(2) may be an important means by which trees reduce the carbon cost of <e>respiration</e>.",M2
19597977,"Direct measurement of energy fluxes from mitochondria into cytoplasm in permeabilized cardiac cells in situ: some evidence for Mitochondrial Interactosome.The aim of this study was to measure energy fluxes from mitochondria in isolated permeabilized cardiomyocytes. <e>Respiration</e> of permeabilized cardiomyocytes and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured in presence of MgATP, pyruvate kinase - phosphoenolpyruvate and creatine. ATP and phosphocreatine concentrations in medium surrounding cardiomyocytes were determined. While ATP concentration did not change in time, mitochondria effectively produced phosphocreatine (PCr) with PCr/O(2) ratio equal to 5.68 +/- 0.14. Addition of heterodimeric tubulin to isolated mitochondria was found to increase apparent Km for exogenous ADP from 11 +/- 2 microM to 330 +/- 47 microM, but creatine again decreased it to 23 +/- 6 microM. These results show directly that under physiological conditions the major energy carrier from mitochondria into cytoplasm is PCr, produced by mitochondrial creatine kinase (MtCK), which functional coupling to adenine nucleotide translocase is enhanced by selective limitation of permeability of mitochondrial outer membrane within supercomplex ATP Synthasome-MtCK-VDAC-tubulin, Mitochondrial Interactosome.",M2
