20410479,"Inhibition of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis by neurons in the ventrolateral medulla and in the nucleus tractus solitarius.Neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) and in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) play important roles in the regulation of cardiovascular and other autonomic functions. In the present study, we demonstrate an inhibition of brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) thermogenesis evoked by activation of neurons in the VLM, as well as by neurons in the intermediate NTS, of chloralose/urethane-anesthetized, artificially ventilated rats. Activation of neurons in either rostral VLM or caudal VLM with N-methyl-d-aspartate (12 nmol) reversed the cold-evoked increase in BAT sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), BAT temperature, and end-expired CO(2). Disinhibition of neurons in either VLM or NTS with the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline (30 pmol), reversed the increases in BAT SNA, BAT temperature, and end-expired CO(2) that were elicited 1) by cold defense; 2) during the febrile model of nanoinjection of prostaglandin E(2) into the medial preoptic area; 3) by activation of neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus or in the rostral raphe pallidus (rRPa); or 4) by the micro-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl. Combined, but not separate, inhibitions of neurons in the VLM and in the NTS, with the GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol (120 pmol/site), produced increases in BAT SNA, BAT temperature, and expired CO(2), which were reversed by nanoinjection of glycine (30 nmol) into the rRPa. These findings suggest that VLM and NTS contain neurons whose activation inhibits BAT thermogenesis, that these neurons receive GABAergic inputs that are active under these experimental conditions, and that neurons in both sites contribute to the tonic inhibition of sympathetic premotor neuronal activity in the rRPa that maintains a low level of BAT thermogenesis in normothermic conditions.",M1
20393157,"Basal adrenergic tone is required for maximal stimulation of rat brown adipose tissue UCP1 expression by chronic PPAR-gamma activation.We investigated the involvement of basal sympathetic tone in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) recruitment and gene expression profile induced by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) activation. Innervated and surgically denervated BAT pads of rats treated or not with rosiglitazone (15 mg.kg(-1).day(-1), 7 days) were evaluated for weight, triacylglycerol (TAG) and DNA content, mitochondrial mass, and gene expression. Rosiglitazone induced BAT recruitment (increased mass, TAG and DNA content) and mRNA levels of lipolytic (adipose tissue triglyceride lipase and CGI58) and lipogenic (lipoprotein lipase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fatty acid binding protein 4, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1) proteins independently of tissue innervation status. Mitochondrial mass and mRNA levels of its regulators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-alpha and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta were not affected by rosiglitazone, while being significantly reduced by denervation. By contrast, maximal stimulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) (thermogenesis), cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor-45-like effector A (inhibitor of UCP1 activity), monoacylglycerol lipase (lipolysis), small heterodimer partner (transcription), and glycerokinase (TAG synthesis) by rosiglitazone depended on the presence of intact BAT innervation. Cold exposure (5 degrees C, 24 h) significantly increased UCP1 mRNA levels in innervated BAT pads of untreated rats, without affecting the already high BAT UCP1 levels of rosiglitazone-treated animals. A similar pattern of response was found in denervated pads, but with markedly lower UCP1 expression than that in innervated BAT. In conclusion, whereas the mass (hyperplasia and hypertrophy), lipogenic, and lipolytic components of BAT recruitment induced by rosiglitazone occur independently of tissue sympathetic innervation, maximal UCP1 expression induced by PPAR-gamma in vivo depends on the presence of basal BAT adrenergic tone. The residual sympathetic tone found under rosiglitazone treatment is, therefore, involved in the modulation of a subset of major components of PPAR-gamma-mediated BAT recruitment.",M1
20357363,"Impact of age on the relationships of brown adipose tissue with sex and adiposity in humans.OBJECTIVE: Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) regulates energy homeostasis and fat mass in mammals and newborns and, most likely, in adult humans. Because BAT activity and BAT mass decline with age in humans, the impact of BAT on adiposity may decrease with aging. In the present study we addressed this hypothesis and further investigated the effect of age on the sex differences in BAT activity and BAT mass. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from 260 subjects (98 with BAT and 162 study date-matched control subjects) who underwent (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) under thermoneutral conditions were analyzed. BAT activity and BAT mass were determined in the upper body. RESULTS: BAT activity and BAT mass were higher in female (1.59 +/- 0.10 and 32 +/- 5 g vs. 1.02 +/- 0.10 and 18 +/- 4 g, both P &lt; or = 0.0006) than in male subjects. In multivariate analyses, sex (P &lt; 0.0001), age (P &lt; 0.0001), and BMI (P = 0.0018) were associated independently with BAT activity. Interestingly, only in male subjects was there an interaction between BMI and age in determining BAT activity (P = 0.008) and BAT mass (P = 0.0002); BMI decreased with increasing BAT activity and BAT mass in the lowest age tertile (Spearman rank correlation coefficient r(s) = -0.38, P = 0.015 and r(s) = -0.37, P = 0.017, respectively), not in the higher age tertiles. Furthermore, BAT activity and mass differed between female and male subjects only in the upper two age tertiles (all P &lt; or = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Our data corroborate that, in general, BAT activity and BAT mass are elevated in female subjects and in younger people. Importantly, we provide novel evidence that the impact of BAT activity and BAT mass on adiposity appears to decline with aging only in male subjects. Furthermore, while BAT activity and BAT mass only moderately decline with increasing age in female subjects, a much stronger effect is found in male subjects.",M1
20160646,"Brown fat as a therapy for obesity and diabetes.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Human fat consists of white and brown adipose tissue (WAT and <e>BAT</e>). Though most fat is energy-storing WAT, the thermogenic capacity of even small amounts of BAT makes it an attractive therapeutic target for inducing weight loss through energy expenditure. This review evaluates the recent discoveries regarding the identification of functional BAT in adult humans and its potential as a therapy for obesity and diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: Over the past year, several independent research teams used a combination of positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging, immunohistochemistry, and gene and protein expression assays to prove conclusively that adult humans have functional BAT. This has occurred against a backdrop of basic studies defining the origins of BAT, new components of its transcriptional regulation, and the role of hormones in stimulation of BAT growth and differentiation. SUMMARY: Adult humans have functional BAT, a new target for antiobesity and antidiabetes therapies focusing on increasing energy expenditure. Future studies will refine the methodologies used to measure BAT mass and activity, expand our knowledge of critical-control points in BAT regulation, and focus on testing pharmacological agents that increase BAT thermogenesis and help achieve long-lasting weight loss and an improved metabolic profile.",M1
20133456,"Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin cross talk regulates brown adipocyte differentiation.Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) is considered of metabolic significance in mammalian physiology, because it plays an important role in regulating energy balance. Alterations in this tissue have been associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The molecular mechanisms modulating brown adipocyte differentiation are not fully understood. Using a murine brown preadipocyte cell line, primary cultures, and 3T3-L1 cells, we analyzed the contribution of various intracellular signaling pathways to adipogenic and thermogenic programs. Sequential activation of p38MAPK and LKB1-AMPK-tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) as well as significant attenuation of ERK1/2 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-p70 S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) activation was observed through the brown differentiation process. This study demonstrates a critical role for AMPK in controlling the mTOR-p70S6K1 signaling cascade in brown but not in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We observed that mTOR activity is essential in the first stages of differentiation. Nevertheless, subsequent inhibition of this cascade by AMPK activation is also necessary at later stages. An in vivo study showed that prolonged 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR)-induced AMPK activation increases uncoupling protein 1 expression and induces an accumulation of brown adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT), as revealed by immunohistology. Moreover, the induction of brown adipogenesis in areas of white fat partially correlates with the body weight reduction detected in response to treatment with AICAR. Taken together, our study reveals that differentiation of brown adipocytes employs different signaling pathways from white adipocytes, with AMPK-mTOR cross talk a central mediator of this process. Promotion of BAT development in WAT by pharmacological activation of AMPK may have potential in treating obesity by acting on energy dissipation.",M1
20124047,"CT Hounsfield units of brown adipose tissue increase with activation: preclinical and clinical studies.Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) densities assessed as CT Hounsfield units (HUs) were evaluated in a rodent model and in patients to determine whether HUs changed in relation to BAT activity. METHODS: Serial (18)F-FDG PET/CT was performed on rats under both room temperature control conditions and after 4 h of cold-stimulation, which is known to activate BAT. The maximum standardized uptake values and CT HUs of BAT were measured, and tissues were examined in the laboratory. Image records from cancer patients who underwent PET/CT were reviewed, and 23 patients were identified who displayed both high and low (18)F-FDG uptake into BAT on serial (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans. The maximum standardized uptake values and CT HUs of BAT were compared in these scans. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) CT HUs of cold-activated BAT (-12.4 +/- 22.4) were significantly higher than those (-27.9 +/- 9.6) of the controls in the rat model. The CT HUs of BAT (-71.6 +/- 18.0) in the patients with high (18)F-FDG uptake were significantly higher than those (-104.4 +/- 16.8) of the patients with low (18)F-FDG uptake . A decrease in relative lipid content is seen in activated BAT in rats on histology. CONCLUSION: The CT HUs of BAT increased in activated conditions in both animals and patients, likely because of lipid consumption by activated BAT.",M1
20111017,"Adipose depots possess unique developmental gene signatures.We have previously demonstrated that subcutaneous and intra-abdominal adipose tissue show different patterns of expression for developmental genes (Shox2, En1, Tbx15 Hoxa5, Hoxc8, and Hoxc9), and that the expression level of Tbx15 and Hoxa5 in humans correlated with the level of obesity and fat distribution. To further explore the role of these developmental genes in adipose tissue, we have characterized their expression in different adipose depots in mice, and studied their regulation in obesity and by fasting. Developmental and adipogenic gene expression was compared in two subcutaneous and three intra-abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) depots as well as brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) from lean or obese mice in a fed or fasting state. Each of these six adipose depots display a unique pattern of developmental gene expression, whereas expression of adipogenic transcription factors PPARgamma2 C/EBPalpha, beta, and Delta showed constant expression levels in all depots. Expression levels of developmental genes were similar in obese (ob/ob and high-fat diet (HFD)) and lean mice in most depots. Fasting systematically decreased expression of Hoxc8, PPARgamma2, and increased C/EBPDelta in both lean and ob/ob mice, but produced only variable changes in the expression of other developmental and adipogenic genes. These data indicate that each fat depot has a unique developmental gene expression signature, which is largely independent of nutritional state. This finding further supports a fundamental role of developmental genes in fat distribution and the development and/or function of specific adipose tissue depots.",M1
20071609,"Endogenous activation of spinal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors contributes to the thermoregulatory activation of brown adipose tissue.Neurons in the rostral raphe pallidus (RPa) play an essential role in the regulation of sympathetically mediated metabolism and thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). The presence of serotonergic neurons in the RPa that are retrogradely labeled following pseudorabies virus injections into BAT suggests that these neurons play a role in the regulation of BAT. In urethane/chloralose-anesthetized rats, whole body cooling decreased skin (-5.7 +/- 2.3 degrees C) and core (-1.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C) temperatures and resulted in an increase in BAT sympathetic nerve activity (SNA; +1,026 +/- 344% of baseline activity). Serial microinjections of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor antagonist, methysergide (1.2 nmol/site), but not saline vehicle, into the intermediolateral cell column (IML) in spinal segments T2-T5 markedly attenuated the cooling-evoked increase in BAT SNA (remaining area under the curve, AUC: 36 +/- 9% of naive cooling response). Microinjections of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, WAY-100635 (1.2 nmol/site), or the 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist, SB-269970 (1.2 nmol/site), into the T2-T5 IML also attenuated the cold-evoked increase in BAT SNA (remaining activity at peak inhibition: 47 +/- 8% and 39 +/- 12% of the initial cold-evoked response, respectively). The increases in BAT SNA evoked by microinjection of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) (12 pmol) or bicuculline (30 pmol) into the RPa were attenuated following microinjections of methysergide, but not saline vehicle, into the T2-T5 IML (NMDA remaining AUC, 64 +/- 13% of naive response; bicuculline remaining AUC, 52 +/- 5% of naive response). These results are consistent with our earlier demonstration of a potentiating effect of 5-HT within the IML on BAT SNA and indicate that activation of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) receptors in the spinal cord contributes to increases in BAT SNA and thermogenesis.",M1
20068229,"Cyclic nucleotides converge on brown adipose tissue differentiation.Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) is rich in mitochondria and can uncouple oxidative phosphorylation to produce heat as a by-product of fatty acid metabolism. This thermogenic effect helps to maintain body temperature and also plays a critical role in energy homeostasis and the regulation of body weight. Both cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) contribute to the intracellular regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and the differentiation of BAT. New evidence has defined the essential role of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase I in a pathway that modulates the RhoA-ROCK pathway and insulin receptor signaling to elicit BAT differentiation and stimulate thermogenesis.",M1
19996183,"Hypothalamic actions of tumor necrosis factor alpha provide the thermogenic core for the wastage syndrome in cachexia.TNFalpha is an important mediator of catabolism in cachexia. Most of its effects have been characterized in peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle and fat. However, by acting directly in the hypothalamus, TNFalpha can activate thermogenesis and modulate food intake. Here we show that high concentration TNFalpha in the hypothalamus leads to increased O(2) consumption/CO(2) production, increased body temperature, and reduced caloric intake, resulting in loss of body mass. Most of the thermogenic response is produced by beta 3-adrenergic signaling to the brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), leading to increased BAT relative mass, reduction in BAT lipid quantity, and increased BAT mitochondria density. The expression of proteins involved in BAT thermogenesis, such as beta 3-adrenergic receptor, peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha, and uncoupling protein-1, are increased. In the hypothalamus, TNFalpha produces reductions in neuropeptide Y, agouti gene-related peptide, proopiomelanocortin, and melanin-concentrating hormone, and increases CRH and TRH. The activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway is also decreased in the hypothalamus of TNFalpha-treated rats. Upon intracerebroventricular infliximab treatment, tumor-bearing and septic rats present a significantly increased survival. In addition, the systemic inhibition of beta 3-adrenergic signaling results in a reduced body mass loss and increased survival in septic rats. These data suggest hypothalamic TNFalpha action to be important mediator of the wastage syndrome in cachexia.",M1
19969105,"Perspective: Does brown fat protect against diseases of aging?The most commonly studied laboratory rodents possess a specialized form of fat called brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) that generates heat to help maintain body temperature in cold environments. In humans, BAT is abundant during embryonic and early postnatal development, but is absent or present in relatively small amounts in adults where it is located in paracervical and supraclavicular regions. BAT cells can 'burn' fatty acid energy substrates to generate heat because they possess large numbers of mitochondria in which oxidative phosphorylation is uncoupled from ATP production as a result of a transmembrane proton leak mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Studies of rodents in which BAT levels are either increased or decreased have revealed a role for BAT in protection against diet-induced obesity. Data suggest that individuals with low levels of BAT are prone to obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease, whereas those with higher levels of BAT maintain lower body weights and exhibit superior health as they age. BAT levels decrease during aging, and dietary energy restriction increases BAT activity and protects multiple organ systems including the nervous system against age-related dysfunction and degeneration. Future studies in which the effects of specific manipulations of BAT levels and thermogenic activity on disease processes in animal models (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers, neurodegenerative diseases) are determined will establish if and how BAT affects the development and progression of age-related diseases. Data from animal studies suggest that BAT and mitochondrial uncoupling can be targeted for interventions to prevent and treat obesity and age-related diseases. Examples include: diet and lifestyle changes; specific regimens of mild intermittent stress; drugs that stimulate BAT formation and activity; induction of brown adipose cell progenitors in muscle and other tissues; and transplantation of brown adipose cells.",M1
19952371,"Protein kinase G controls brown fat cell differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis.Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) is a primary site of energy expenditure through thermogenesis, which is mediated by the uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) in mitochondria. Here, we show that protein kinase G (PKG) is essential for brown fat cell differentiation. Induction of adipogenic markers and fat storage was impaired in the absence of PKGI. Furthermore, PKGI mediated the ability of nitric oxide (NO) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) to induce mitochondrial biogenesis and increase the abundance of UCP-1. Mechanistically, we found that PKGI controlled insulin signaling in BAT by inhibiting the activity of RhoA and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), thereby relieving the inhibitory effects of ROCK on insulin receptor substrate-1 and activating the downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt cascade. Thus, PKGI links NO and cGMP signaling with the RhoA-ROCK and the insulin pathways, thereby controlling induction of adipogenic and thermogenic programs during brown fat cell differentiation.",M1
19931319,"Genetic suppression of ghrelin receptors activates brown adipocyte function and decreases fat storage in rats.To clarify the role of ghrelin and its receptor (GHS-R) in the regulatory mechanism of energy metabolism, we analyzed transgenic (Tg) rats expressing an antisense GHS-R mRNA under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter. Tg rats showed lower visceral fat weight and higher O(2) consumption, CO(2) production, rectal temperature, dark-period locomotor activity, brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) weight and uncoupling protein 1 expression compared with wild-type (WT) rats on a standard diet. A high-fat diet for 14days significantly increased body weight, visceral fat weight, and the sizes of white and brown adipocytes in WT rats but not in Tg rats compared with the corresponding standard-diet groups. Antisense GHS-R mRNA was expressed and GHS-R expression was reduced in TH-expressing cells of the vagal nodose ganglion in Tg rats. Ghrelin administered intravenously suppressed noradrenaline release in the BAT of WT rats, but not in Tg rats. These results suggest that ghrelin/GHS-R plays an important role in energy storage by modifying BAT function and locomotor activity. As our previous study showed that peripheral ghrelin-induced noradrenaline release suppression in BAT is blocked by vagotomy, the present findings also suggest that vagal afferents transmit the peripheral ghrelin signal to the sympathetic nervous system innervating BAT.",M1
19906816,"Expression of uncoupling protein 1 in mouse brown adipose tissue is thyroid hormone receptor-beta isoform specific and required for adaptive thermogenesis.Cold-induced adaptive (or nonshivering) thermogenesis in small mammals is produced primarily in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). BAT has been identified in humans and becomes more active after cold exposure. Heat production from BAT requires sympathetic nervous system stimulation, T(3), and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression. Our previous studies with a thyroid hormone receptor-beta (TR beta) isoform-selective agonist demonstrated that after TR beta stimulation alone, adaptive thermogenesis was markedly impaired, although UCP-1 expression in BAT was normal. We used mice with a dominant-negative TR beta PV mutation (frameshift mutation in resistance to thyroid hormone patient PV) to determine the role of TR beta in adaptive thermogenesis and UCP1 expression. Wild-type and PV mutant mice were made hypothyroid and replaced with T(3) (7 ng/g x d) for 10 d to produce similar serum thyroid hormone concentration in the wild-type and mutant mice. The thermogenic response of interscapular BAT, as determined by heat production during iv infusions of norepinephrine, was reduced in PV beta heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice. The level of UCP1, the key thermogenic protein in BAT, was progressively reduced in PV beta(+/-) and PV beta(-/-) mutant mice. Brown adipocytes isolated from PV mutant mice had some reduction in cAMP and glycerol production in response to adrenergic stimulation. Defective adaptive thermogenesis in TR beta PV mutant mice is due to reduced UCP1 expression and reduced adrenergic responsiveness. TR beta mediates T(3) regulation of UCP1 in BAT and is required for adaptive thermogenesis.",M1
19897683,"Thyroid hormone induced brown adipose tissue and amelioration of diabetes in a patient with extreme insulin resistance.CONTEXT: Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) found by positron emission/computed tomography (PET-CT) using flouro-deoxyglucose (FDG) is inducible by cold exposure in men. Factors leading to increased BAT are of great interest for its potential role in the treatment of diabetes and obesity. OBJECTIVE: We tested whether thyroid hormone (TH) levels are related to the volume and activity of BAT in a patient with a mutation in the insulin receptor gene. DESIGN/SETTING/INTERVENTION: Our work was based on the case report of a patient in an observational study at the National Institutes of Health. PATIENT: The patient discontinued insulin and oral antidiabetics after thyroidectomy and suppressive-dose levothyroxine therapy for thyroid cancer. PET-CT uptake in BAT was confirmed by histology and molecular analysis. OUTCOMES: PET-CT studies were performed, and we measured hemoglobin A1c and resting energy expenditure before and after levothyroxine discontinuation for thyroid cancer testing. Molecular studies of BAT and white adipose samples are presented. RESULT: Supraclavicular and periumbilical sc adipose tissue demonstrated molecular features of BAT including uncoupling protein-1, type 2 deiodinase, and PR domain containing 16 by quantitative PCR. Activity of type 2 deiodinase activity was increased. The discontinuation of levothyroxine resulted in decreased FDG uptake and diminished volume of BAT depots accompanied by worsening of diabetic control. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the TH effect on BAT activity and volume in this patient and an association between BAT activity and glucose levels in this patient. Because the contribution of TH on skeletal muscle energy expenditure and fuel metabolism was not assessed, an association between BAT activity and glucose homeostasis can only be suggested.",M1
19863797,"Analysis of knockout mice suggests a role for VGF in the control of fat storage and energy expenditure.BACKGROUND: Previous studies of mixed background mice have demonstrated that targeted deletion of Vgf produces a lean, hypermetabolic mouse that is resistant to diet-, lesion-, and genetically-induced obesity. To investigate potential mechanism(s) and site(s) of action of VGF, a neuronal and endocrine secreted protein and neuropeptide precursor, we further analyzed the metabolic phenotypes of two independent VGF knockout lines on C57Bl6 backgrounds. RESULTS: Unlike hyperactive VGF knockout mice on a mixed C57Bl6-129/SvJ background, homozygous mutant mice on a C57Bl6 background were hypermetabolic with similar locomotor activity levels to Vgf+/Vgf+ mice, during day and night cycles, indicating that mechanism(s) other than hyperactivity were responsible for their increased energy expenditure. In Vgf-/Vgf- knockout mice, morphological analysis of brown and white adipose tissues (<e>BAT</e> and WAT) indicated decreased fat storage in both tissues, and decreased adipocyte perimeter and area in WAT. Changes in gene expression measured by real-time RT-PCR were consistent with increased fatty acid oxidation and uptake in BAT, and increased lipolysis, decreased lipogenesis, and brown adipocyte differentiation in WAT, suggesting that increased sympathetic nervous system activity in Vgf-/Vgf- mice may be associated with or responsible for alterations in energy expenditure and fat storage. In addition, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and UCP2 protein levels, mitochondrial number, and mitochondrial cristae density were upregulated in Vgf-/Vgf- BAT. Using immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques, we detected VGF in nerve fibers innervating BAT and Vgf promoter-driven reporter expression in cervical and thoracic spinal ganglia that project to and innervate the chest wall and tissues including BAT. Moreover, VGF peptide levels were quantified by radioimmunoassay in BAT, and were found to be down-regulated by a high fat diet. Lastly, despite being hypermetabolic, VGF knockout mice were cold intolerant. CONCLUSION: We propose that VGF and/or VGF-derived peptides modulate sympathetic outflow pathways to regulate fat storage and energy expenditure.",M1
19846801,"Insulin causes hyperthermia by direct inhibition of warm-sensitive neurons.OBJECTIVE: Temperature and nutrient homeostasis are two interdependent components of energy balance regulated by distinct sets of hypothalamic neurons. The objective is to examine the role of the metabolic signal insulin in the control of core body temperature (CBT). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of preoptic area administration of insulin on CBT in mice was measured by radiotelemetry and respiratory exchange ratio. In vivo 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose uptake into brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) was measured in rats after insulin treatment by positron emission tomography combined with X-ray computed tomography imaging. Insulin receptor-positive neurons were identified by retrograde tracing from the raphe pallidus. Insulin was locally applied on hypothalamic slices to determine the direct effects of insulin on intrinsically warm-sensitive neurons by inducing hyperpolarization and reducing firing rates. RESULTS: Injection of insulin into the preoptic area of the hypothalamus induced a specific and dose-dependent elevation of CBT mediated by stimulation of BAT thermogenesis as shown by imaging and respiratory ratio measurements. Retrograde tracing indicates that insulin receptor-expressing warm-sensitive neurons activate BAT through projection via the raphe pallidus. Insulin applied on hypothalamic slices acted directly on intrinsically warm-sensitive neurons by inducing hyperpolarization and reducing firing rates. The hyperthermic effects of insulin were blocked by pretreatment with antibodies to insulin or with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that insulin can directly modulate hypothalamic neurons that regulate thermogenesis and CBT and indicate that insulin plays an important role in coupling metabolism and thermoregulation at the level of anterior hypothalamus.",M1
19833890,"Leucine deprivation decreases fat mass by stimulation of lipolysis in white adipose tissue and upregulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown adipose tissue.OBJECTIVE: White adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) play distinct roles in adaptation to changes in nutrient availability, with WAT serving as an energy store and BAT regulating thermogenesis. We previously showed that mice maintained on a leucine-deficient diet unexpectedly experienced a dramatic reduction in abdominal fat mass. The cellular mechanisms responsible for this loss, however, are unclear. The goal of current study is to investigate possible mechanisms. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed either control, leucine-deficient, or pair-fed diets for 7 days. Changes in metabolic parameters and expression of genes and proteins related to lipid metabolism were analyzed in WAT and BAT. RESULTS: We found that leucine deprivation for 7 days increases oxygen consumption, suggesting increased energy expenditure. We also observed increases in lipolysis and expression of beta-oxidation genes and decreases in expression of lipogenic genes and activity of fatty acid synthase in WAT, consistent with increased use and decreased synthesis of fatty acids, respectively. Furthermore, we observed that leucine deprivation increases expression of uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 in BAT, suggesting increased thermogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time that elimination of dietary leucine produces significant metabolic changes in WAT and BAT. The effect of leucine deprivation on UCP1 expression is a novel and unexpected observation and suggests that the observed increase in energy expenditure may reflect an increase in thermogenesis in BAT. Further investigation will be required to determine the relative contribution of UCP1 upregulation and thermogenesis in BAT to leucine deprivation-stimulated fat loss.",M1
19752162,"Distinct effects of leptin and a melanocortin receptor agonist injected into medial hypothalamic nuclei on glucose uptake in peripheral tissues.OBJECTIVE: The medial hypothalamus mediates leptin-induced glucose uptake in peripheral tissues, and brain melanocortin receptors (MCRs) mediate certain central effects of leptin. However, the contributions of the leptin receptor and MCRs in individual medial hypothalamic nuclei to regulation of peripheral glucose uptake have remained unclear. We examined the effects of an injection of leptin and the MCR agonist MT-II into medial hypothalamic nuclei on glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Leptin or MT-II was injected into the ventromedial (VMH), dorsomedial (DMH), arcuate nucleus (ARC), or paraventricular (PVH) hypothalamus or the lateral ventricle (intracerebroventricularly) in freely moving mice. The MCR antagonist SHU9119 was injected intracerebroventricularly. Glucose uptake was measured by the 2-[(3)H]deoxy-d-glucose method. RESULTS: Leptin injection into the VMH increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), and heart, whereas that into the ARC increased glucose uptake in BAT, and that into the DMH or PVH had no effect. SHU9119 abolished these effects of leptin injected into the VMH. Injection of MT-II either into the VMH or intracerebroventricularly increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, BAT, and heart, whereas that into the PVH increased glucose uptake in BAT, and that into the DMH or ARC had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: The VMH mediates leptin- and MT-II-induced glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, BAT, and heart. These effects of leptin are dependent on MCR activation. The leptin receptor in the ARC and MCR in the PVH regulate glucose uptake in BAT. Medial hypothalamic nuclei thus play distinct roles in leptin- and MT-II-induced glucose uptake in peripheral tissues.",M1
19729852,"Histochemical demonstration of monocarboxylate transporters in mouse brown adipose tissue.Proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are essential for the transport of lactate, ketone bodies, and other monocarboxylates through the plasma membrane. The present immunohistochemical study aimed to examine the expression of MCTs in the brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) of mice. An intense immunoreactivity for MCT1 was found in the plasma membrane of brown adipose cells at light and electron microscopic levels but not in white adipose cells. The expression of MCT1 in BAT was confirmed by Western blot and in situ hybridization analyses. In fetuses (E17.5) and neonates, the MCT1 mRNA expression of BAT was abundant and appeared more intense than that in adult animals. These results, together with the intense expression of CD147 (a functional partner of MCTs) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase-2 (a component of fatty acid oxidation) in perinatal periods, suggest the involvement of MCT1 in the uptake of monocarboxylates from the circulation for thermogenesis rather than lipogenesis.",M1
19726709,"Role of hypoleptinemia during cold adaptation in Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii).Brandt's voles Lasiopodomys brandtii exhibit large increases in nonshivering thermogenesis to cope with chronic cold exposure, resulting in compensatory hyperphagia and fat mobilization. These physiological events are accompanied by a remarkable reduction in serum leptin levels. However, the role of hypoleptinemia in cold adaptation in this species is still unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that hypoleptinemia contributes to increases in food intake and brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) thermogenesis by modifying hypothalamic neuropeptides in cold-exposed Brandt's voles. Adult male voles were transferred to 5 degrees C for 28 days. Accompanied by a decrease in serum leptin levels, hypothalamic agouti-related protein (AgRP) mRNA levels were significantly increased, but there were no changes in the long form of leptin receptor (Ob-Rb), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated peptide (CART) mRNA levels in the hypothalamus. When cold-exposed voles were returned to warm (23 degrees C) for 28 days, body mass, food intake, serum leptin, and AgRP mRNA were restored to control levels. Leptin administration in cold-exposed voles decreased food intake as well as hypothalamic AgRP mRNA levels. There were no significant effects of leptin administration on hypothalamic Ob-Rb, SOCS3, NPY, POMC, CART mRNA, and uncoupling protein 1 levels under cold conditions. These results suggest that hypoleptinemia partially contributes to cold-induced hyperphagia, which might involve the elevation of hypothalamic AgRP gene expression.",M1
19713219,"A TRbeta-selective agonist confers resistance to diet-induced obesity.Thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta also listed as THRB on the MGI Database)-selective agonists activate brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) thermogenesis, while only minimally affecting cardiac activity or lean body mass. Here, we tested the hypothesis that daily administration of the TRbeta agonist GC-24 prevents the metabolic alterations associated with a hypercaloric diet. Rats were placed on a high-fat diet and after a month exhibited increased body weight (BW) and adiposity, fasting hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance, increased plasma levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, nonesterified fatty acids and interleukin-6. While GC-24 administration to these animals did not affect food ingestion or modified the progression of BW gain, it did increase energy expenditure, eliminating the increase in adiposity without causing cardiac hypertrophy. Fasting hyperglycemia remained unchanged, but treatment with GC-24 improved glucose tolerance by increasing insulin sensitivity, and also normalized plasma triglyceride levels. Plasma cholesterol levels were only partially normalized and liver cholesterol content remained high in the GC-24-treated animals. Gene expression in liver, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue was only minimally affected by treatment with GC-24, with the main target being BAT. In conclusion, during high-fat feeding treatment with the TRbeta-selective agonist, GC-24 only partially improves metabolic control probably as a result of accelerating the resting metabolic rate.",M1
19705265,"Uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) contributes to the basal proton conductance of brown adipose tissue mitochondria.Proton leak pathways uncouple substrate oxidation from ATP synthesis in mitochondria. These pathways are classified as basal (not regulated) or inducible (activated and inhibited). Previously it was found that over half of the basal proton conductance of muscle mitochondria was catalyzed by the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), an abundant mitochondrial anion carrier protein. To determine whether ANT is the unique protein catalyst, or one of many proteins that catalyze basal proton conductance, we measured proton leak kinetics in mitochondria isolated from brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). BAT can express another mitochondrial anion carrier, UCP1, at concentrations similar to ANT. Basal proton conductance was measured under conditions where UCP1 and ANT were catalytically inactive and was found to be lower in mitochondria from UCP1 knockout mice compared to wild-type. Ablation of another abundant inner membrane protein, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, had no effect on proton leak kinetics in mitochondria from liver, kidney or muscle, showing that basal proton conductance is not catalyzed by all membrane proteins. We identify UCP1 as a second protein propagating basal proton leak, lending support to the hypothesis that basal leak pathways are perpetrated by members of the mitochondrial anion carrier family but not by other mitochondrial inner membrane proteins.",M1
19696186,"Brown adipose tissue and seasonal variation in humans.OBJECTIVE: Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) is present in adult humans where it may be important in the prevention of obesity, although the main factors regulating its abundance are not well established. BAT demonstrates seasonal variation relating to ambient temperature and photoperiod in mammals. The objective of our study was therefore to determine whether seasonal variation in BAT activity in humans was more closely related to the prevailing photoperiod or temperature. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 3,614 consecutive patients who underwent positron emission tomography followed by computed tomography scans. The presence and location of BAT depots were documented and correlated with monthly changes in photoperiod and ambient temperature. RESULTS: BAT activity was demonstrated in 167 (4.6%) scans. BAT was demonstrated in 52/724 scans (7.2%) in winter compared with 27/1,067 (2.5%) in summer months (P &lt; 0.00001, chi(2) test). Monthly changes in the occurrence of BAT were more closely related to differences in photoperiod (r(2) = 0.876) rather than ambient temperature (r(2) = 0.696). Individuals with serial scans also demonstrated strong seasonal variation in BAT activity (average standardized uptake value [SUV(max)] 1.5 in July and 9.4 in January). BAT was also more common in female patients (female: n = 107, 7.2%; male: n = 60, 2.8%; P &lt; 0.00001, chi(2) test). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a very strong seasonal variation in the presence of BAT. This effect is more closely associated with photoperiod than ambient temperature, suggesting a previously undescribed mechanism for mediating BAT function in humans that could now potentially be recruited for the prevention or reversal of obesity.",M1
19679172,"Brown adipose tissue thermogenesis heats brain and body as part of the brain-coordinated ultradian basic rest-activity cycle.Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), body and brain temperatures, as well as behavioral activity, arterial pressure and heart rate, increase episodically during the waking (dark) phase of the circadian cycle in rats. Phase-linking of combinations of these ultradian (&lt;24 h) events has previously been noted, but no synthesis of their overall interrelationships has emerged. We hypothesized that they are coordinated by brain central command, and that BAT thermogenesis, itself controlled by the brain, contributes to increases in brain and body temperature. We used chronically implanted instruments to measure combinations of bat, brain and body temperatures, behavioral activity, tail artery blood flow, and arterial pressure and heart rate, in conscious freely moving Sprague-Dawley rats during the 12-h dark active period. Ambient temperature was kept constant for any particular 24-h day, varying between 22 and 27 degrees C on different days. Increases in BAT temperature (&gt; or = 0.5 degrees C) occurred in an irregular episodic manner every 94+/-43 min (mean+/-SD). Varying the temperature over a wider range (18-30 degrees C) on different days did not change the periodicity, and neither body nor brain temperature fell before BAT temperature episodic increases. These increases are thus unlikely to reflect thermoregulatory homeostasis. Episodic BAT thermogenesis still occurred in food-deprived rats. Behavioral activity, arterial pressure (18+/-5 mmHg every 98+/-49 min) and heart rate (86+/-31 beats/min) increased approximately 3 min before each increase in BAT temperature. Increases in BAT temperature (1.1+/-0.4 degrees C) were larger than corresponding increases in brain (0.8+/-0.4 degrees C) and body (0.6+/-0.3 degrees C) temperature and the BAT episodes commenced 2-3 min before body and brain episodes, suggesting that BAT thermogenesis warms body and brain. Hippocampal 5-8 Hz theta rhythm, indicating active engagement with the environment, increased before the behavioral and autonomic events, suggesting coordination by brain central command as part of the 1-2 h ultradian basic rest-activity cycle (BRAC) proposed by Kleitman.",M1
19643094,"Leptin  gates  thermogenic action of thyrotropin-releasing hormone in the hindbrain.Leptin, acting as a measure of metabolic fuel availability, exerts a powerful permissive influence on neurogenic thermogenesis. During starvation and an absence of leptin, animals cannot produce thermogenic reactions to cold stress. However, thermogenesis is rescued by restoring leptin. We have previously observed (Hermann, G.E., Barnes, M.J., Rogers, R.C., 2006. Leptin and thyrotropin-releasing hormone: cooperative action in the hindbrain to activate brown adipose thermogenesis. Brain Res. 1117, 118-124.) a highly cooperative interaction between leptin and thyrotropin-releasing hormone [TRH] to activate hindbrain generated thermogenic responses. Specifically, exposure to both leptin and TRH elicited a 3.5 degrees C increase in brown adipose tissue [<e>BAT</e>] thermogenesis, while leptin alone did not evoke any change, and TRH alone caused only approximately 1 degrees C increase. The present study shows that the leptin-TRH synergy in controlling brown adipose [BAT] thermogenesis is order-specific and dependent on the feeding status of the animal. That is, fourth ventricular [4V] application of leptin to the food-deprived animal, before TRH injection, yields a substantial increase in BAT; while the reverse order yields a significantly smaller effect. If the animal were fed within minutes of anesthesia, then exogenous leptin was not necessary for TRH to yield a large increase in BAT temperature. The leptin-TRH synergy was uncoupled by pretreatment with the phosphoinositol-tris phosphate kinase [PI3K] inhibitor, wortmannin and the Src-SH2 antagonist, PP2. The TRH transduction mechanism utilizes phospholipase C [PLC] potently regulated by the SH2 site. Previous work in culture systems suggests that the product of PI3K activity [PIP3] potently upregulates PLC by activating the SH2 domain of the PLC complex. Perhaps leptin  gates  the thermogenic action of TRH in the hindbrain by invoking this same mechanism.",M1
19643091,"Acute brown adipose tissue temperature response to cold in monosodium glutamate-treated Siberian hamsters.Neonatal monosodium glutamate (MSG) administration increases adiposity, decreases energy expenditure and is associated with arcuate nucleus (Arc) destruction. Disrupted brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) thermogenesis underlies some of these effects, although, interscapular BAT temperature (T(IBAT)) has not been measured. Therefore, we tested the effects of neonatal MSG or vehicle administration in Siberian hamsters and, when they were adults, measured T(IBAT) during acute cold exposure. The Arc and its projection to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVH) are both components of the CNS outflow circuits to IBAT, with the latter implicated in BAT thermogenesis that could be compromised by MSG treatment. Using a viral transneuronal tract tracer, pseudorabies virus (PRV), we also tested whether the components of these circuits were intact. As adults, MSG-treated hamsters had significantly increased body mass and some white fat pad masses, markedly reduced Arc Nissl and neuropeptide staining, and PVH neuropeptide fiber staining. Cold-exposed (18 h at 5 degrees C) MSG- and vehicle-treated hamsters initially maintained T(IBAT), but the ability of the former waned after 2 h being significantly decreased by 18 h. PRV immunoreactive fibers/cells were not altered by neonatal MSG treatment despite substantial Arc and PVH destruction. MSG- and vehicle-treated hamsters given an exogenous norepinephrine challenge showed identical increases in the duration and peak of T(IBAT). Thus, the inability of MSG-treated animals to sustain T(IBAT) in the cold is not due to any obvious MSG-induced deletions of central sympathetic outflow circuits to IBAT, but appears to be extrinsic to the tissue nevertheless.",M1
19622065,"Not all mitochondrial carrier proteins support permeability transition pore formation: no involvement of uncoupling protein 1.The mPTP (mitochondrial permeability transition pore) is a non-specific channel that is formed in the mitochondrial inner membrane in response to several stimuli, including elevated levels of matrix calcium. The pore is proposed to be composed of the ANT (adenine nucleotide translocase), voltage-dependent anion channel and cyclophilin D. Knockout studies, however, have demonstrated that ANT is not essential for permeability transition, which has led to the proposal that other members of the mitochondrial carrier protein family may be able to play a similar function to ANT in pore formation. To investigate this possibility, we have studied the permeability transition properties of <e>BAT</e> (brown adipose tissue) mitochondria in which levels of the mitochondrial carrier protein, UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1), can exceed those of ANT. Using an improved spectroscopic assay, we have quantified mPTP formation in de-energized mitochondria from wild-type and Ucp1KO (Ucp1-knockout) mice and assessed the dependence of pore formation on UCP1. When correctly normalized for differences in mitochondrial morphology, we find that calcium-induced mPTP activity is the same in both types of mitochondria, with similar sensitivity to GDP (approximately 50% inhibited), although the portion sensitive to cyclosporin A is higher in mitochondria lacking UCP1 (approximately 80% inhibited, compared with approximately 60% in mitochondria containing UCP1). We conclude that UCP1 is not a component of the cyclosporin A-sensitive mPTP in BAT and that playing a role in mPTP formation is not a general characteristic of the mitochondrial carrier protein family but is, more likely, restricted to specific members including ANT.",M1
19614545,"Mitochondrial proton conductance in skeletal muscle of a cold-exposed marsupial, Antechinus flavipes, is unlikely to be involved in adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis but displays increased sensitivity toward carbon-centered radicals.The organs and molecular mechanisms contributing to adaptive thermogenesis in marsupials are not known because some species apparently lack brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). The increased oxidative capacity and presence of uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) in skeletal muscle led to speculations on whether uncoupled respiration sustains endothermy in the cold, as found for BAT. Here, we investigated the role of mitochondrial proton conductance in the small Australian marsupial Antechinus flavipes during cold exposure. Although there was a tendency toward higher oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle, indicating metabolic adjustments to the cold, we observed no change in basal proton conductance of isolated myotubular and liver mitochondria. In eutherians, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) is an activator of mitochondrial uncoupling mediated by UCP3 and ANT (adenine nucleotide translocase). In the marsupial A. flavipes, proton conductance in myotubular mitochondria could be induced by HNE selectively in the cold-acclimated group. Induced uncoupling activity could be attributed to the ANT as judged by inhibition with carboxyatractylate, while GDP, a putative inhibitor of rodent UCP3, had no detectable effects on marsupial UCP3. In contrast to previous expectations, basal proton conductance in the myotubular mitochondria of marsupials does not contribute to adaptive thermogenesis, as found for eutherian BAT. Increased sensitivity of proton conductance to HNE by the ANT suggests a greater requirement for mild uncoupling activity that may convey protection from lipid peroxidation and mitigate reactive oxygen species production during cold stress.",M1
19598006,"Uncoupling protein-3 as a molecular determinant of the action of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine on energy metabolism.Thyroid hormones are known to stimulate thermogenesis in rodents by exerting a permissive effect on norepinephrine that affects uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) expression in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). The aim of this study was to identify new targets of the thermogenic effects of T3 in tissues other than the BAT, such as skeletal muscle. In beta(1)/beta(2)/beta(3)-adrenoceptor knockout (beta-less) mice, that are dramatically cold intolerant, a normal body temperature was maintained throughout 48 h of cold exposure by T3 administration. In these mice, BAT UCP1 protein expression was not modified either by cold exposure or by T3 administration. To test the possibility that T3 might act via muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3), an UCP3 knockout (KO) model was used. This model exhibited a normal phenotype except that, upon T3 administration, stimulated oxygen consumption of the UCP3KO mice was significantly lower by 6% than that of the wild-type (WT) mice. This difference was observed only during the dark period (between 7.00 p.m. and 7.00 a.m.), i.e. when the mice are the most active at consuming food. Therefore, UCP3 might participate in the correction by T3 of the dramatic cold intolerance of the beta-less mice. These results reactivate the idea that UCP3 might play a role in the control of energy balance.",M1
19595466,"<e>BAT</e>: a new target for human obesity?Two types of adipose tissue can be distinguished histologically and functionally: white (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Whereas BAT is specialized in the production of heat, WAT stores excess energy as triacylglycerols. BAT is present throughout life in rodents, whereas in humans it was thought to involute rapidly postnatally, having essentially disappeared within the first years after birth. However, positron emission tomography has provided evidence that adults retain metabolically active BAT depots that can be induced in response to cold and sympathetic nervous system activation. These findings together with the recent identification of specific molecular determinants (PRDM16 and BMP7) activating brown adipogenesis highlights BAT as a potential relevant target for pharmacological and gene expression manipulation to combat human obesity.",M1
19577538,"Acute cold exposure-induced down-regulation of CIDEA, cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor-alpha-like effector A, in rat interscapular brown adipose tissue by sympathetically activated beta3-adrenoreceptors.The thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) largely depends on the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which is up-regulated by environmental alterations such as cold. Recently, CIDEA (cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor-alpha-like effector A) has also been shown to be expressed at high levels in the mitochondria of BAT. Here we examined the effect of cold on the mRNA and protein levels of CIDEA in interscapular BAT of conscious rats with regard to the sympathetic nervous system. Cold exposure (4 degrees C for 3h) elevated the plasma norepinephrine level and increased norepinephrine turnover in BAT. Cold exposure resulted in down-regulation of the mRNA and protein levels of CIDEA in BAT, accompanied by up-regulation of mRNA and protein levels of UCP1. The cold exposure-induced changes of CIDEA and UCP1 were attenuated by intraperitoneal pretreatment with propranolol (a non-selective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist) (2mg/animal) or SR59230A (a selective beta(3)-adrenoreceptor antagonist) (2mg/animal), respectively. These results suggest that acute cold exposure resulted in down-regulation of CIDEA in interscapular BAT by sympathetically activated beta(3)-adrenoreceptor-mediated mechanisms in rats.",M1
19564408,"C/EBPalpha and the corepressors CtBP1 and CtBP2 regulate repression of select visceral white adipose genes during induction of the brown phenotype in white adipocytes by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists.White adipose tissue (WAT) stores energy in the form of triglycerides, whereas brown tissue (<e>BAT</e>) expends energy, primarily by oxidizing lipids. WAT also secretes many cytokines and acute-phase proteins that contribute to insulin resistance in obese subjects. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) with synthetic agonists induces a brown phenotype in white adipocytes in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrate that this phenotypic conversion is characterized by repression of a set of white fat genes ( visceral white ), including the resistin, angiotensinogen, and chemerin genes, in addition to induction of brown-specific genes, such as Ucp-1. Importantly, the level of expression of the  visceral white  genes is high in mesenteric and gonadal WAT depots but low in the subcutaneous WAT depot and in BAT. Mutation of critical amino acids within helix 7 of the ligand-binding domain of PPARgamma prevents inhibition of visceral white gene expression by the synthetic agonists and therefore shows a direct role for PPARgamma in the repression process. Inhibition of the white adipocyte genes also depends on the expression of C/EBPalpha and the corepressors, carboxy-terminal binding proteins 1 and 2 (CtBP1/2). The data further show that repression of resistin and angiotensinogen expression involves recruitment of CtBP1/2, directed by C/EBPalpha, to the minimal promoter of the corresponding genes in response to the PPARgamma ligand. Developing strategies to enhance the brown phenotype in white adipocytes while reducing secretion of stress-related cytokines from visceral WAT is a means to combat obesity-associated disorders.",M1
19545626,"Oleoyl-estrone affects lipid metabolism in adrenalectomized rats treated with corticosterone through modulation of SREBP1c expression.Oleoyl-estrone (OE) elicits a decrease in body fat, which is blocked by glucocorticoids. In order to analyze this counterregulatory effect, we studied the effects of oral OE on adrenalectomized female rats simultaneously receiving corticosterone (subcutaneous pellets). Circulating corticosteroids, liver glycogen, lipids and the expressions in whole liver, soleus muscle, interscapular brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), and the inguinal and periovaric white adipose tissue (WAT) of genes controlling lipid metabolism were analyzed. Corticosterone reversed OE lipid mobilization, storing fat in liver and subcutaneous WAT. This was not simply the predominance of corticosteroid enhancement of lipogenesis against OE inhibition, but a synergy to enhance lipogenesis. Periovaric WAT showed a different effect, with corticosterone inhibiting OE arrest of lipogenic gene expressions. The data presented suggests that interaction of OE and glucocorticoids (and the metabolic response) depends on the organ or WAT site; there was a direct relationship on the direction and extent of change of SREBP1c expression with those of important energy and lipid handling genes. Our results confirm that corticosterone blocks - and even reverses - OE effects on body lipids in a dose-dependent way, a process mediated, at least in part, by modulation of SREBP1c expression.",M1
19528236,"Neuronal protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B deficiency results in inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK and isoform-specific activation of AMPK in peripheral tissues.PTP1B(-/-) mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity due to leptin hypersensitivity and consequent increased energy expenditure. We aimed to determine the cellular mechanisms underlying this metabolic state. AMPK is an important mediator of leptin's metabolic effects. We find that alpha1 and alpha2 AMPK activity are elevated and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase activity is decreased in the muscle and brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) of PTP1B(-/-) mice. The effects of PTP1B deficiency on alpha2, but not alpha1, AMPK activity in BAT and muscle are neuronally mediated, as they are present in neuron- but not muscle-specific PTP1B(-/-) mice. In addition, AMPK activity is decreased in the hypothalamic nuclei of neuronal and whole-body PTP1B(-/-) mice, accompanied by alterations in neuropeptide expression that are indicative of enhanced leptin sensitivity. Furthermore, AMPK target genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and energy expenditure are induced with PTP1B inhibition, resulting in increased mitochondrial content in BAT and conversion to a more oxidative muscle fiber type. Thus, neuronal PTP1B inhibition results in decreased hypothalamic AMPK activity, isoform-specific AMPK activation in peripheral tissues, and downstream gene expression changes that promote leanness and increased energy expenditure. Therefore, the mechanism by which PTP1B regulates adiposity and leptin sensitivity likely involves the coordinated regulation of AMPK in hypothalamus and peripheral tissues.",M1
19502644,"Mice lacking Pctp /StarD2 exhibit increased adaptive thermogenesis and enlarged mitochondria in brown adipose tissue.Pctp(-/-) mice that lack phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (Pctp) exhibit a marked shift toward utilization of fatty acids for oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting that Pctp may regulate the entry of fatty acyl-CoAs into mitochondria. Here, we examined the influence of Pctp expression on the function and structure of brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), a mitochondrial-rich, oxidative tissue that mediates nonshivering thermogenesis. Consistent with increased thermogenesis, Pctp(-/-) mice exhibited higher core body temperatures than wild-type controls at room temperature. During a 24 h cold challenge, Pctp(-/-) mice defended core body temperature efficiently enough that acute, full activation of BAT thermogenic genes did not occur. Brown adipocytes lacking Pctp harbored enlarged and elongated mitochondria. Consistent with increased fatty acid utilization, brown adipocytes cultured from Pctp(-/-) mice exhibited higher oxygen consumption rates in response to norepinephrine. The absence of Pctp expression during brown adipogenesis in vitro altered the expression of key transcription factors, which could be corrected by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Pctp early but not late during the differentiation. Collectively, these findings support a key role for Pctp in limiting mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids and thus regulating adaptive thermogenesis in BAT.",M1
19497350,"Effect of 4G-alpha-glucopyranosyl hesperidin on brown fat adipose tissue- and cutaneous-sympathetic nerve activity and peripheral body temperature.Changes in the activity of the autonomic nervous system are good indicators of alterations in physiological phenomena such as the body temperature, blood glucose, blood pressure. Hesperidin, a flavanone known as vitamin P, has been shown to reduce the levels of serum lipids, cholesterol, and blood pressure. However, hesperidin is not water-soluble and is not well absorbed from the intestine. G-hesperidin (4G-alpha-glucopyranosyl hesperidin) is more water-soluble and more rapidly absorbed than hesperidin. In order to clarify the functions of G-hesperidin, we examined the effects of oral administration of G-hesperidin on interscapular brown adipose tissue-sympathetic nerve activity (<e>BAT</e>-SNA) and cutaneous sympathetic nerve activity (CASNA) in rats weighing about 300 g. In this study, we found that oral administration of 60 mg of G-hesperidin increased the BAT-SNA but decreased the CASNA in urethane-anesthetized rats. Since an elevation in BAT-SNA increases heat production (i.e. body temperature (BT)) and a decrease in CASNA increases cutaneous perfusion, we examined whether oral administration of G-hesperidin had an effect on the peripheral BT in rats. Consequently, we observed that the subcutaneous BT at the caudal end of the back after oral administration of 60 mg of G-hesperidin was significantly higher than the subcutaneous BT after oral administration of water in conscious rats. These findings suggest that G-hesperidin enhances the BAT-SNA and suppresses the CASNA resulting in an increase in the peripheral BT, probably by an increase in the thermogenesis in the BAT and an elevation in the cutaneous blood flow.",M1
19491401,"Combinatorial transcription factor regulation of the cyclic AMP-response element on the Pgc-1alpha promoter in white 3T3-L1 and brown HIB-1B preadipocytes.Cold stress in rodents increases the expression of UCP1 and PGC-1alpha in brown and white adipose tissue. We have previously reported that C/EBPbeta specifically binds to the CRE on the proximal Pgc-1alpha promoter and increases forskolin-sensitive Pgc-1alpha and Ucp1 expression in white 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Here we show that in mice exposed to a cold environment for 24 h, Pgc-1alpha, Ucp1, and C/ebpbeta but not C/ebpalpha or C/ebpdelta expression were increased in <e>BAT</e>. Conversely, expression of the C/EBP dominant negative Chop10 was increased in WAT but not BAT during cold exposure. Reacclimatization of cold-exposed mice to a warm environment for 24 h completely reversed these changes in gene expression. In HIB-1B, brown preadipocytes, forskolin increased expression of Pgc-1alpha, Ucp1, and C/ebpbeta early in differentiation and inhibited Chop10 expression. Employing chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that C/EBPbeta, CREB, ATF-2, and CHOP10 are bound to the Pgc-1alpha proximal CRE, but CHOP10 does not bind in HIB-1B cell lysates. Forskolin stimulation and C/EBPbeta overexpression in 3T3-L1 cells increased C/EBPbeta and CREB but displaced ATF-2 and CHOP10 binding to the Pgc-1alpha proximal CRE. Overexpression of ATF-2 and CHOP10 in 3T3-L1 cells decreased Pgc-1alpha transcription. Knockdown of Chop10 in 3T3-L1 cells using siRNA increased Pgc-1alpha transcription, whereas siRNA against C/ebpbeta in HIB-1B cells decreased Pgc-1alpha and Ucp1 expression. We conclude that the increased cAMP stimulation of Pgc-1alpha expression is regulated by the combinatorial effect of transcription factors acting at the CRE on the proximal Pgc-1alpha promoter.",M1
19429100,"Nicotine suppresses energy storage through activation of sympathetic outflow to brown adipose tissue via corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor.Nicotine is known to stimulate energy expenditure, although the precise mechanism is unclear. To clarify the involvement of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the mechanism by which nicotine increases energy expenditure, the effect of intraperitoneal injection of nicotine (0.1 or 0.5mg/kg) on the release of noradrenaline (NA), a stimulator of thermogenesis, in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) important for energy expenditure was examined in rats. We also examined the effects of CRF receptor subtype antagonists on the nicotine-induced change in BAT NA release. Nicotine significantly increased BAT NA release at a dose of 0.5mg/kg, and the increase was completely blocked by antalarmin, a CRF type 1 receptor antagonist, but not by antisauvagine-30, a CRF type 2 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that nicotine increases energy expenditure by activating BAT function, and that CRF type 1 receptors are involved in the mechanism by which nicotine affects energy balance.",M1
19422379,"The soluble leptin receptor neutralizes leptin-mediated STAT3 signalling and anorexic responses in vivo.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The soluble leptin receptor (SLR) is the major, circulating, leptin-binding protein and, in vitro, the SLR inhibits leptin-binding to cell surface receptors. Here we assessed the effects of the SLR on physiological responses to leptin, in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: SLR and leptin were given as a single injection (intracerebroventricularly, i.c.v.) or by central (i.c.v.) and peripheral (s.c.) infusion to normal adult F344XBN rats. Phosphorylation of hypothalamic STAT3 (Western blot), food intake and body weight, and the thermogenic response in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) were measured. KEY RESULTS: Acute central co-administration of SLR (13.5 microg) and leptin (90 ng) blocked the threefold increase in hypothalamic STAT3 phosphorylation induced by leptin alone, 1 h after the injections. Peripheral leptin infusion (0.1 mg day(-1) for 7 days; s.c.) induced a significant reduction in food intake and body weight, which were partially blocked with a simultaneous central infusion of SLR (4.3 microg day(-1); i.c.v.). In a second experiment, SLR central infusion alone (5.5 microg day(-1)) increased food intake and body weight, suggesting that the SLR was able to neutralize endogenous leptin in the brain. This dose of SLR, infused together with a lower dose of peripheral leptin (0.05 mg day(-1)), abolished the thermogenic response in BAT, but the anorexic responses and weight reduction were only partially attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide direct evidence that the SLR neutralizes leptin, endogenous or exogenous, in vivo. By neutralizing leptin, the SLR may play a regulatory role in energy homeostasis.",M1
19417078,"The presence of UCP1 demonstrates that metabolically active adipose tissue in the neck of adult humans truly represents brown adipose tissue.Classically, adult humans have been considered not to possess active brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). However, positron-emission-tomography has shown fluorodeoxyglucose uptake that is distributed in such a way (e.g., in the neck) that it would seem to be BAT. Until now this has not been supported by direct evidence that these areas truly represented BAT, that is, the presence of the BAT-unique uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). Samples of adipose tissue from the neck of 35 patients undergoing surgery for thyroid diseases were obtained and analyzed. In 1/3 of the subjects (the younger and leaner), distinct islands composed of UCP1 immunoreactive brown adipocytes could clearly be discerned, accounting for up to 1/3 of all adipocytes. The brown-adipose islands were richly sympathetically innervated (indicating acute central control); adjacent white adipose areas were not. The capillary density was high, implying a high capacity for oxygen delivery. Cells with features of brown adipocyte precursors were found in pericapillary areas. These data demonstrate that human adults indeed possess BAT and thus imply possibilities of future therapeutic strategies for the treatment of obesity, including maintenance of brown adipocytes and stimulation of the growth of preexisting brown precursors.",M1

The objective is to examine the prevalence of metabolically active BAT in healthy adult humans and to clarify the effects of cold exposure and adiposity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In vivo 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake into adipose tissue was measured in 56 healthy volunteers (31 male and 25 female subjects) aged 23-65 years by positron emission tomography (PET) combined with X-ray computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: When exposed to cold (19 degrees C) for 2 h, 17 of 32 younger subjects (aged 23-35 years) and 2 of 24 elderly subjects (aged 38-65 years) showed a substantial FDG uptake into adipose tissue of the supraclavicular and paraspinal regions, whereas they showed no detectable uptake when kept warm (27 degrees C). Histological examinations confirmed the presence of brown adipocytes in these regions. The cold-activated FDG uptake was increased in winter compared with summer (P &lt; 0.001) and was inversely related to BMI (P &lt; 0.001) and total (P &lt; 0.01) and visceral (P &lt; 0.001) fat areas estimated from CT image at the umbilical level. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, being against the conventional view, indicate the high incidence of metabolically active BAT in adult humans and suggest a role in the control of body temperature and adiposity.",M1
19351665,"Ghrelin suppresses noradrenaline release in the brown adipose tissue of rats.To clarify the role of ghrelin in the regulatory mechanism of energy metabolism, we analyzed the effects of centrally and peripherally administered ghrelin on noradrenaline release in the brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) of rats using a microdialysis system. I.c.v. administration of ghrelin at a dose of 500 pmol suppressed noradrenaline release in BAT, and microinjection of ghrelin (50 pmol) into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) or arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus also suppressed noradrenaline release in BAT. In addition, i.v. administered ghrelin (30 nmol) suppressed noradrenaline release in BAT, and this suppression was blocked by a vagotomy. Neither i.c.v. nor i.v. administration of des-acyl ghrelin, which does not bind to GH secretagogue receptor type 1a (GHS-R1a), affected noradrenaline release in BAT. These results indicate that ghrelin increases energy storage by suppressing the activity of the sympathetic nerve innervating BAT. It seems that the PVN and ARC, which express GHS-R1a, are the sites of action of ghrelin in the brain and that the action of peripheral ghrelin on the sympathetic nerve activity innervating BAT is mediated by the vagal nerve, which also expresses GHS-R1a.",M1
19339685,"Transcriptional control of brown adipocyte development and physiological function--of mice and men.The last several years have seen an explosion of information relating to the transcriptional control of brown fat cell development. At the same time, new data have emerged that clearly demonstrate that adult humans do indeed have substantial amounts of functioning brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). Together, these advances are stimulating a reassessment of the role of brown adipose tissue in human physiology and pathophysiology. These data have also opened up exciting new opportunities for the development of entirely novel classes of therapeutics for metabolic diseases like obesity and type 2 diabetes.",M1
19327390,"Different populations of prostaglandin EP3 receptor-expressing preoptic neurons project to two fever-mediating sympathoexcitatory brain regions.The central mechanism of fever induction is triggered by an action of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) on neurons in the preoptic area (POA) through the EP3 subtype of prostaglandin E receptor. EP3 receptor (EP3R)-expressing POA neurons project directly to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and to the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus (rRPa), key sites for the control of thermoregulatory effectors. Based on physiological findings, we hypothesize that the febrile responses in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) and those in cutaneous vasoconstrictors are controlled independently by separate neuronal pathways: PGE(2) pyrogenic signaling is transmitted from EP3R-expressing POA neurons via a projection to the DMH to activate BAT thermogenesis and via another projection to the rRPa to increase cutaneous vasoconstriction. In this case, DMH-projecting and rRPa-projecting neurons would constitute segregated populations within the EP3R-expressing neuronal group in the POA. Here, we sought direct anatomical evidence to test this hypothesis with a double-tracing experiment in which two types of the retrograde tracer, cholera toxin b-subunit (CTb), conjugated with different fluorophores were injected into the DMH and the rRPa of rats and the resulting retrogradely labeled populations of EP3R-immunoreactive neurons in the POA were identified with confocal microscopy. We found substantial numbers of EP3R-immunoreactive neurons in both the DMH-projecting and the rRPa-projecting populations. However, very few EP3R-immunoreactive POA neurons were labeled with both the CTb from the DMH and that from the rRPa, although a substantial number of neurons that were not immunoreactive for EP3R were double-labeled with both CTbs. The paucity of the EP3R-expressing neurons that send collaterals to both the DMH and the rRPa suggests that pyrogenic signals are sent independently to these caudal brain regions from the POA and that such pyrogenic outputs from the POA reflect different control mechanisms for BAT thermogenesis and for cutaneous vasoconstriction by distinct sets of POA neurons.",M1
19274054,"Differentiation and characterization in primary culture of white adipose tissue brown adipocyte-like cells.BACKGROUND: Rodent brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) is considered the main effector of adaptative thermogenesis as it contains a unique mitochondrial uncoupling protein, termed as uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). The emergence of ectopic brown adipocytes in the white adipose tissue (WAT), called recruitment, might play an important role in the prevention of obesity. The recruitment phenomenon has until now been investigated mostly in vivo. OBJECTIVES: This study is an attempt to mimic in vitro the recruitment phenomenon. It consisted in culturing the stroma vascular fractions of mouse BAT and WAT in a brown adipocyte differentiation medium. The multilocular cells obtained, referred to as BAT(B) and WAT(B) adipocytes, respectively, were compared. RESULTS: The BAT(B) and WAT(B) adipocytes were morphologically different. The expressions of UCP1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), leptin and resistin mRNAs were low in WAT(B) adipocytes as compared with those in BAT(B) adipocytes. The expressions of UCP1 and PGC-1alpha proteins were, however, much higher in WAT(B) adipocytes, amounting 51% and 36% of those in BAT(B) adipocytes. The patterns of expression of UCP1, PGC-1alpha and leptin in the BAT(B) and in WAT(B) adipocytes were different with a higher relative expression of PGC-1alpha in the latter. Rosiglitazone increased UCP1 mRNA expression 4.5-fold in the BAT(B) and significantly more, 7.9-fold, in the WAT(B) adipocytes. Retinoic acid and triiodothyronine increased UCP1 mRNA expression in the BAT(B) adipocytes 1.6- and 2-fold, respectively but, surprisingly, slightly decreased UCP1 mRNA expression in the WAT(B) adipocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that the nature and possibly the origin of WAT brown adipocytes is different from that of BAT brown adipocytes. It proposes an in vitro approach that could prove very useful to better characterize the WAT brown adipocyte-like cells.",M1
19239631,"Brown adipose tissue: the molecular mechanism of its formation.The function of brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) is to oxidize fat and to dissipate the energy produced as heat, providing a source of heat to the organism. Preadipocytes are stimulated by expression of the PRDM16 gene to differentiate into BAT cells. The PRDM16 protein is greatly enriched in BAT and causes increased expression of mitochondrial genes and greater density of mitochondria. It increases expression of the uncoupling factor UCP1 and thereby causes a large stimulation of uncoupled respiration with resultant heat production, enhanced by cAMP. Recent evidence strongly supports the idea that the PRDM16 gene determines BAT identity.",M1
19231144,"Cold exposure does not decrease serum leptin concentration, but increases energy intake and thermogenic capacity in pregnant Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii).In most mammals, maternal body mass and fat mass increase during pregnancy due to hyperphagia. These physiological changes provide the fetus with energy and nutrients and prepare the mother for the high energetic demands of lactation. In the present study, metabolic changes in response to cold and pregnancy were examined in female Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii). At 23+/-1 degrees C, the voles increased body mass and deposited body fat during pregnancy. However, at 5+/-1 degrees C pregnant voles did not deposit body fat even though energy intake increased above the level in the warm. Serum leptin concentration increased during pregnancy and was not influenced by cold exposure. Thermogenic capacity, as indicated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) content in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), increased in cold-exposed pregnant voles. The number and mass of fetuses were not affected by cold exposure. Our data may indicate the importance of an increased serum leptin concentration for a successful outcome of the pregnancy and also the independence of leptin secretion from body fat in pregnant voles. It also implies the need to develop central leptin resistance with respect to control of energy balance for pregnant voles.",M1
19211724,"Nonshivering thermogenesis without interscapular brown adipose tissue involvement during conditioned fear in the rat.As with other forms of psychological stress, conditioned fear causes an increase in body temperature. The mechanisms underlying this stress-induced hyperthermia are not well understood, but previous research suggests that nonshivering thermogenesis might contribute, as it does during cold exposure. The major source of nonshivering thermogenesis in the rat is brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), and the largest BAT deposit in that species is in the interscapular area just below the skin. BAT is also under sympathetic control via beta-adrenoceptors. If BAT contributes to fear-induced hyperthermia, then the interscapular skin should warm up faster than other skin areas, and this response should be suppressed by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. We tested this noninvasively by infrared thermography. In conscious rats, 30 min of contextual fear caused hyperthermia (as indicated by a +1.5 degrees C increase in lumbar back skin temperature) and increased the difference in temperature between interscapular and lumbar back skin (TiScap - TBack) by +1 degrees C. Propranolol (10 mg/kg ip) completely abolished this hyperthermia; however, the TiScap-TBack increase was not reduced. In contrast, exposure to cold air (4 degrees C) induced a +2.7 degrees C increase in TiScap-TBack, which was reduced to +1 degrees C after propranolol. The results show that conditioned fear-induced hyperthermia is of nonshivering origin and mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, but interscapular BAT does not contribute to it and does not appear to be activated, either.",M1
19211718,"The PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone enhances rat brown adipose tissue lipogenesis from glucose without altering glucose uptake.We investigated the mechanisms whereby peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonism affects glucose and lipid metabolism in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) by studying the impact of PPARgamma activation on BAT glucose uptake and metabolism, lipogenesis, and mRNA levels plus activities of enzymes involved in triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis. Interscapular BAT of rats treated or not with rosiglitazone (15 mg*kg(-1).day(-1), 7 days) was evaluated in vivo for glucose uptake and lipogenesis and in vitro for glucose metabolism, gene expression, and activities of glycerolphosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), phosphatidate phosphatase-1 (PAP or lipin-1), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). Rosiglitazone increased BAT mass without affecting whole tissue glucose uptake. BAT glycogen content (-80%), its synthesis from glucose (-50%), and mRNA levels of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (-40%), which generates UDP-linked glucose for glycogen synthesis, were all reduced by rosiglitazone. In contrast, BAT TAG-glycerol synthesis in vivo and glucose incorporation into TAG-glycerol in vitro were stimulated by the agonist along with the activities and mRNA levels of glycerol 3-phosphate-generating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glycerokinase. Furthermore, rosiglitazone markedly increased the activities of GPAT and DGAT but not those of lipin-1-mediated PAP-1, enzymes involved in the sequential acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate and TAG synthesis. Because an adequate supply of fatty acids is essential for BAT nonshivering thermogenesis, the enhanced ability of BAT to synthesize TAG under PPARgamma activation may constitute an important mechanism by which lipid substrates are stored in preparation for an eventual thermogenic activation.",M1
19188245,"A novel approach for reduction of brown fat uptake on FDG PET.The aim of this study was to determine whether or not a single dose of a beta-blocker, such as propranolol 40 mg, administered 60 min prior to (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) injection would help reduce brown fat uptake of (18)F-FDG. Patients who were referred for either a pre-treatment or a post-treatment evaluation positron emission tomography (PET) scan and who showed (18)F-FDG uptake in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) were included in this study. The total number of patients who showed uptake in BAT and in whom a repeat study was carried out after propranolol injection was 40. A repeat PET scan was carried out after an interval of at least 48 h. Propranolol at a dose of 40 mg was given orally 60 min prior to the (18)F-FDG injection. A whole-body PET scan was performed on a dedicated whole-body PET scanner (ADVANCE, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), using attenuation correction with 68-Ge external pin sources. We observed that (18)F-FDG uptake in BAT was absent in 36 (90%) patients post propranolol. We conclude that propranolol reduces the uptake of (18)F-FDG in BAT, and thus improves the accuracy of PET imaging.",M1
19175509,"Have we entered the brown adipose tissue renaissance?In the 1970s and 1980s, it was observed that rodents could offset excess calories ingested when they were fed a human-like 'cafeteria diet'. Although it was erroneously concluded that this so-called diet-induced thermogenesis was because of brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), it led to efforts to test whether variations in brown fat in humans may explain the susceptibility to obesity. However, from evidence on the inability of ephedrine or beta-3 adrenergic agonists to induce BAT thermogenesis, it was concluded that the thermogenic role of BAT was unimportant in adult humans largely because humans had low numbers of brown adipocytes. Solid evidence on the actual numbers of brown adipocytes in humans was not available. We are now re-evaluating the role of BAT for the treatment of obesity given the following recent observations (i) studies in nuclear medicine by using PET/CT scanning reveal the presence of BAT in adult humans; and (ii) recent data suggest that a new transcription factor called PDRM16 may control the induction of BAT. These recent discoveries should revamp our effort to target the molecular development of brown adipogenesis in the treatment of obesity.",M1
19129373,"Neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus inhibit sympathetic outflow to brown adipose tissue.The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) plays an important role in energy homeostasis, regulating neuroendocrine, behavioral, and autonomic functions. However, the role of the PVH in regulating thermogenesis and energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) is unclear. The present study investigated the effect of activating neurons within the PVH on BAT thermogenesis. In urethane- and chloralose-anesthetized, artificially ventilated rats maintained at a core body temperature of 37.0-38.0 degrees C, microinjection of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, 12 pmol in 60 nl) in the PVH did not increase BAT sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) or BAT thermogenesis. In contrast, the increase in BAT SNA evoked by body cooling was completely reversed by microinjection of NMDA in the PVH. Additionally, the increases in BAT SNA evoked by body cooling, by microinjection of prostaglandin E(2) (170 pmol in 60 nl) in the medial preoptic area or by microinjection of bicuculline (30 pmol in 60 nl) in the dorsomedial hypothalamus were completely reversed by microinjection of bicuculline (30 pmol in 60 nl) in the PVH. Although the increases in BAT SNA and thermogenesis evoked by microinjection of NMDA (12 pmol in 60 nl) in the raphe pallidus (RPa) was markedly attenuated following microinjection of bicuculline (30 pmol) in the PVH, the increases in BAT SNA and thermogenesis evoked by microinjection of bicuculline (30 pmol in 60 nl) in the RPa were unaffected by microinjection of bicuculline in the PVH. These results demonstrate that disinhibition of neurons in the PVH inhibits BAT SNA likely via activation of a GABAergic input to BAT sympathetic premotor neurons in the RPa.",M1
19107124,"The role of thermogenesis in antipsychotic drug-induced weight gain.The administration of antipsychotic drugs to human patients or experimental animals leads to significant weight gain, which is widely presumed to be driven by hyperphagia; however, the contribution from energy expenditure remains unclear. These studies aim to examine the contribution of shifts in energy expenditure, particularly those involving centrally mediated changes in thermogenesis, to the body weight gain associated with the administration of olanzapine to female Sprague Dawley rats. Olanzapine (6 mg/kg/day orally) caused a transient increase in food intake but a maintained increase in body weight. When pair-fed rats were treated with olanzapine, body weight continued to rise compared to vehicle-treated rats, consistent with a reduction in energy expenditure. Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) temperature, measured using biotelemetry devices, decreased immediately after the onset of olanzapine treatment and remained depressed, as did physical activity. UCP1 expression in interscapular BAT was reduced following chronic olanzapine treatment. An acute injection of olanzapine was preceded by an injection of a retrograde tracer into the spinal cord to evaluate the nature of the olanzapine-activated neural pathway. Levels of Fos protein in a number of spinally projecting neurons within discrete hypothalamic and brainstem sites were elevated in olanzapine-treated rats. Some of these neurons in the perifornical region of the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) were also Orexin A positive. These data collectively show a significant impact of thermogenesis (and physical activity) on the weight gain associated with olanzapine treatment. The anatomical studies provide an insight into the central neuroanatomical substrate that may subserve the altered thermogenic responses brought about by olanzapine.",M1
19066310,"Hypothalamic ERK mediates the anorectic and thermogenic sympathetic effects of leptin.OBJECTIVE: Leptin is an adipocyte hormone that plays a major role in energy balance. Leptin receptors in the hypothalamus are known to signal via distinct mechanisms, including signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) and phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI 3-kinase). Here, we tested the hypothesis that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is mediating leptin action in the hypothalamus. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Biochemical, pharmacological, and physiological approaches were combined to characterize leptin activation of ERK in the hypothalamus in rats. RESULTS: Leptin activates ERK1/2 in a receptor-mediated manner that involves JAK2. Leptin-induced ERK1/2 activation was restricted to the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Pharmacological blockade of hypothalamic ERK1/2 reverses the anorectic and weight-reducing effects of leptin. The pharmacological antagonists of ERK1/2 did not attenuate leptin-induced activation of STAT3 or PI 3-kinase. Blockade of ERK1/2 abolishes leptin-induced increases in sympathetic nerve traffic to thermogenic brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) but does not alter the stimulatory effects of leptin on sympathetic nerve activity to kidney, hindlimb, or adrenal gland. In contrast, blockade of PI 3-kinase prevents leptin-induced sympathetic activation to kidney but not to BAT, hindlimb, or adrenal gland. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that hypothalamic ERK plays a key role in the control of food intake, body weight, and thermogenic sympathetic outflow by leptin but does not participate in the cardiovascular and renal sympathetic actions of leptin.",M1
19057531,"The effects of rimonabant on brown adipose tissue in rat: implications for energy expenditure.The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant (SR 141716) produces a sustained decrease in body weight on a background of a transient reduction in food intake. An increase in energy expenditure has been implicated, possibly mediated via peripheral endocannabinoid system; however, the role of the central endocannabinoid system is unclear. The present study investigates this role. Rimonabant (10 mg/kg IP) was administered for 21 days to rats surgically implanted with biotelemetry devices to measure temperature in the interscapular brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). BAT temperature as a putative measure of thermogenesis in the BAT, physical activity, body weight, food intake, as well as changes in UCP1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were measured. In addition, role of the CNS in mediating these actions of rimonabant was determined in rats where the BAT was sympathetically denervated. As expected, chronic administration of rimonabant significantly reduced body weight for the entire treatment period despite only a transient decrease in food intake. There was a profound increase in BAT temperature, particularly during the dark phase of each circadian cycle throughout the treatment period. A corresponding increase in uncoupling protein (UCP1) was also observed following chronic rimonabant treatment. The rimonabant-induced elevation in BAT temperature and decrease in body weight were significantly attenuated following denervation, indicating an involvement of the CNS. These findings suggest that the long-term weight loss associated with rimonabant treatment is due at least in part to an elevation in energy expenditure, represented here by elevated temperature recorded in the BAT, which is mediated primarily by the central endocannabinoid system.",M1
19056354,"Flow cytometric and immunohistochemical detection of in vivo BrdU-labeled cells in mouse fat depots.This study has determined the natural frequency and localization of progenitor/stem cells within fat depots in situ based on their ability to retain DNA nucleotide label (BrdU). Neonate and mature male C57BL6/J mice were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU- and label-retaining cells (LRC) were quantified in fat depots by immunohistochemical, immunofluorescent, and flow cytometric methods. In neonates, LRC constituted 27% of the cells in inguinal fat (iWAT) and 65% in interscapular brown fat (<e>BAT</e>) after Day 10 and 26% of the cells in epididymal fat (eWAT) after Day 28. After 52 days, the LRC accounted for 0.72% of iWAT, 0.53% of eWAT and 1.05% of BAT, respectively. The BrdU-labeled cells localized to two areas: single cells distributed among adipocytes or those adjacent to the blood vessels wall. In mature C57BL6/J mice, flow cytometric analysis determined that a majority of the LRC were also positive for stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1).",M1
19037639,"Constant ambient temperature of 24 degrees C significantly reduces FDG uptake by brown adipose tissue in children scanned during the winter.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine if warming patients prior to and during (18)F-FDG uptake by controlling the room temperature could decrease uptake by brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). METHODS: A group of 40 children underwent (18)F-FDG PET after being kept in the injection room at a constant temperature of 24 degrees C for half an hour before and 1 hour after intravenous tracer administration. The rate of uptake by BAT in this group was compared to the uptake in a control group of 45 patients who underwent PET when the injection room temperature was 21 degrees C. RESULTS: Uptake by BAT occurred in 5% of studies in the temperature-controlled room compared to 31% of studies performed when the injection room temperature was 21 degrees C (p&lt;0.002). CONCLUSION: Maintaining room temperature at a constant 24 degrees C, half an hour prior to and during the period of FDG uptake significantly decreases accumulation of FDG in BAT in children.",M1
18996592,"Possible role of the histaminergic system in autonomic and cardiovascular responses to neuropeptide Y.Previous studies have demonstrated that neuropeptide Y (NPY) affects blood pressure (BP) in anesthetized rats. Here, we examined the effects of the third cerebral ventricular (3CV) injection of various doses of NPY on renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and BP in anesthetized rats. 3CV injection of NPY suppressed RSNA and BP in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, suppressing effects of NPY on RSNA and BP were eliminated by lateral cerebral ventricular (LCV) preinjection of thioperamide, an antagonist of histaminergic H3-receptor, not diphenhydramine, an antagonist of histaminergic H1-receptor. In addition, 3CV injection of NPY accelerated gastric vagal nerve activity (GVNA) and inhibited brown adipose tissue sympathetic nerve activity (<e>BAT</e>-SNA) of anesthetized rats, and lowered brown adipose tissue temperature (BAT-T) of conscious rats. Thus, these evidences suggest that central NPY affects autonomic nerves containing RSNA, GVNA or BAT-SNA, and BP by mediating central histaminergic H3-receptors.",M1
18952046,"High efficiency of ROS production by glycerophosphate dehydrogenase in mammalian mitochondria.We investigated hydrogen peroxide production in mitochondria with low (liver, heart, brain) and high (brown adipose tissue, <e>BAT</e>) content of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH). ROS production at state 4 due to electron backflow from mGPDH was low, but after inhibition of electron transport with antimycin A high rates of mGPDH-dependent ROS production were observed in liver, heart and brain mitochondria. When this ROS production was related to activity of mGPDH, many-fold higher ROS production was found in contrast to succinate- (39-, 28-, 3-fold) or pyruvate plus malate-dependent ROS production (32-, 96-, 5-fold). This specific rate of mGPDH-dependent ROS production was also exceedingly higher (28-, 66-, 22-fold) compared to that in BAT. mGPDH-dependent ROS production was localized to the dehydrogenase+CoQ and complex III, the latter being the highest in all mitochondria but BAT. Our results demonstrate high efficiency of mGPDH-dependent ROS production in mammalian mitochondria with a low content of mGPDH and suggest its endogenous inhibition in BAT.",M1
18938135,"Induction of fatty acid-binding protein 3 in brown adipose tissue correlates with increased demand for adaptive thermogenesis in rodents.We investigated the contribution of fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) to adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) in rodents. The expression of FABP3 mRNA in BAT was regulated discriminatively in response to alteration of the ambient temperature, which regulation was similar and reciprocal to the regulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and leptin, respectively. FABP3 expression in the BAT was significantly higher in the UCP1-knockout (KO) mice than in the wild-type ones, and these KO mice showed a higher clearance rate of free fatty acid from the plasma. In addition, FABP3 expression in the BAT was increased greatly with the development of diet-induced obesity in mice. These results indicate that the induction of FABP3 in BAT correlates with an increased demand for adaptive thermogenesis in rodents. FABP3 appears to be essential for accelerating fatty acid flux and its oxidation through UCP1 activity for non-shivering thermogenesis in BAT.",M1
18828761,"Oleoyl-oestrone inhibits lipogenic, but maintains thermogenic, gene expression of brown adipose tissue in overweight rats.In the present study we intended to determine how <e>BAT</e> (brown adipose tissue) maintained thermogenesis under treatment with OE (oleoyl-oestrone), a powerful slimming hormone that sheds off body lipid but maintains the metabolic rate. Overweight male rats were subjected to daily gavages of 10 nmol/g of OE or vehicle (control) for 10 days. A PF (pair-fed) vehicle-receiving group was used to discount the effects attributable to energy availability limitation. Interscapular BAT mass, lipid, DNA, mRNA and the RT-PCR (real-time PCR) expression of lipid and energy metabolism genes for enzymes and regulatory proteins were measured. BAT mass and lipid were decreased in OE and PF, with the latter showing a marked reduction in tissue mRNA. Maintenance of perilipin gene expression in PF and OE rats despite the loss of lipid suggests the preservation of the vacuolar interactive surface, a critical factor for thermogenic responsiveness. OE and, to a lesser extent, PF maintained the expression of genes controlling lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, but markedly decreased the expression of those genes involved in lipogenic and acyl-glycerol synthesis. OE did not affect UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) (decreased in PF), beta(3) adrenergic receptors or hormone-sensitive lipase gene mRNAs, which may translate in maintaining a full thermogenic system potential. OE rats were able to maintain a less energetically stressed BAT (probably through glucose utilization) than PF rats. These changes were not paralleled in PF rats, in which lower thermogenesis and glucose preservation resulted in a heavier toll on internal fat stores. Thus the mechanism of action of OE is more complex and tissue-specific than previously assumed.",M1
18769061,"The serum levels of 17beta-estradiol, progesterone and triiodothyronine correlate with brown adipose tissue thermogenic parameters during aging.Sex and thyroid hormones are among the factors modulating energy metabolism through regulation of mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) in old female rats has been shown to maintain, better than males, the ability to produce heat when exposed to cold. Considering the decline that takes place in gonadal and thyroid function during aging, the aim of this work was to test whether the age-related hormonal status may be a potential mediator of the gender differences in BAT decline. COX activity, UCP1, mitochondrial respiration rate, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), as well as the serum levels of sex steroids (17beta-estradiol, progesterone and testosterone) and thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) were measured in 6-, 18-, and 24-month (mo) old male and female rats kept at 22 degrees C. Six mo-old female rats showed higher thermogenic features than males. Male rats at 18-mo showed a decrease in uncoupling activity compared to females. Both genders showed marked signs of atrophy in BAT of 24-mo-old rats, characterized by a decrease in total DNA, mitochondrial protein, COX and UCP1, whereas mtDNA was found to increase. Sex steroid hormones were well correlated with BAT parameters when both genders were considered, however, T3 was the hormone with the strongest positive correlations in female rats. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence suggesting that T3 may be a potential mediator of the sexual dimorphism in the effect of aging on the functional decline of BAT.",M1
18719022,"Mice lacking the thyroid hormone receptor-alpha gene spend more energy in thermogenesis, burn more fat, and are less sensitive to high-fat diet-induced obesity.Unable to activate brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) thermogenesis, alphaT3-receptor-deficient mice (Thra-0/0) are cold intolerant. Our objective was to investigate the impact on energy economy and mechanisms of the alternate facultative thermogenesis developed. Energy expenditure (oxygen and food consumption) is elevated in Thra-0/0 mice reared at room temperature. Such difference disappears at thermoneutrality (30 C) and expands as ambient temperature becomes colder (P &lt; 0.001). Despite eating more, Thra-0/0 are leaner than wild-type (WT) mice (P &lt; 0.01), whereas these, whether on chow or high-fat diet, gained more weight (g/d: 0.12 +/- 0.002 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.002 and 0.25 +/- 0.005 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.005, respectively) and adiposity than Thra-0/0 mice (P &lt; 0.001). The respiratory quotient was lower in Thra-0/0 than WT mice (P &lt; 0.001), after feeding or fasted, on chow or high-fat diet, indicating a preference for fat as fuel, which was associated with increased lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in skeletal muscle of Thra-0/0 mice but with no differences in gene expression in white adipose tissue. Type-2 deiodinase (D2) was increased in BAT and aerobic muscle of Thra-0/0 mice. This and liver D1 were increased by a high-fat diet in both genotypes, as also were serum T3 and T3/T4 ratio, but more in Thra-0/0 than WT mice (P &lt; 0.001). Remarkably, when studied at thermoneutrality, genotype differences in weight and adiposity gain, respiratory quotient, D2, and LPL disappeared. Thus, disruption of BAT thermogenesis in Thra-0/0 mice activates an alternate facultative thermogenesis that is more energy demanding and associated with reduced fuel efficiency, leanness, increased capacity to oxidize fat, and relative resistance to diet-induced obesity, in all of which muscle LPL and deiodinases play a key role.",M1
18715288,"Resistin increases islet blood flow and decreases subcutaneous adipose tissue blood flow in anaesthetized rats.AIM: Resistin is an adipokine which has been suggested to participate in the induction of insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether acute administration of resistin influences tissue blood perfusion in rats. METHODS: Resistin was administered as an intravenous infusion of 7.5 microg h(-1) (1.5 mL h(-1)) for 30 min to rats anaesthetized with thiobutabarbital. A microsphere technique was used to estimate the blood flow to six different depots of white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), as well as to the pancreas, islets, duodenum, colon, kidneys, adrenal glands and liver. RESULTS: Resistin administration led to an increased blood flow to the pancreas and islets and a decrease in subcutaneous WAT and BAT. Intra-abdominal white adipose tissue blood flow and that to other organs were not affected. CONCLUSION: Acute administration of resistin markedly affects the blood perfusion of both the pancreas and subcutaneous white adipose tissue depots. At present it is unknown whether resistin exerts a direct effect on the vasculature, or works through local or systemic activation of endothelial cells and/or macrophages. The extent to which this might contribute to the insulin resistance caused by resistin is yet unknown.",M1
18694395,"Mfsd2a encodes a novel major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein highly induced in brown adipose tissue during fasting and adaptive thermogenesis.This study describes the identification of Mfsd2a (major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2a), a novel mammalian major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein, and an additional closely related protein, Mfsd2b. Most intron/exon junctions are conserved between the two genes, suggesting that they are derived from a common ancestor. Mfsd2a and Mfsd2b share a 12 transmembrane alpha-helical domain structure that bears greatest similarity to that of the bacterial Na(+)/melibiose symporters. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that Mfsd2a localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Mfsd2a is expressed in many tissues and is highly induced in liver and <e>BAT</e> (brown adipose tissue) during fasting. Mfsd2a displays an oscillatory expression profile in BAT and liver, consistent with a circadian rhythm. Although the basal level of Mfsd2a expression is relatively low in mouse BAT, it is greatly induced during cold-induced thermogenesis and after treatment with betaAR (beta-adrenergic receptor) agonists. This induction is totally abolished in beta-less (betaAR-deficient) mice. These findings indicate that Mfsd2a is greatly up-regulated in BAT during thermogenesis and that its induction is controlled by the betaAR signalling pathway. The observed induction of Mfsd2a expression in cultured BAT cells by dibutyryl-cAMP is in agreement with this conclusion. The present study suggests that Mfsd2a plays a role in adaptive thermogenesis.",M1
18682832,"Up-regulation of mitochondrial activity and acquirement of brown adipose tissue-like property in the white adipose tissue of fsp27 deficient mice.Fsp27, a member of the Cide family proteins, was shown to localize to lipid droplet and promote lipid storage in adipocytes. We aimed to understand the biological role of Fsp27 in regulating adipose tissue differentiation, insulin sensitivity and energy balance. Fsp27(-/-) mice and Fsp27/lep double deficient mice were generated and we examined the adiposity, whole body metabolism, <e>BAT</e> and WAT morphology, insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial activity, and gene expression changes in these mouse strains. Furthermore, we isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wildtype and Fsp27(-/-) mice, followed by their differentiation into adipocytes in vitro. We found that Fsp27 is expressed in both brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) and its levels were significantly elevated in the WAT and liver of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Fsp27(-/-) mice had increased energy expenditure, lower levels of plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids. Furthermore, Fsp27(-/-)and Fsp27/lep double-deficient mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and display increased insulin sensitivity. Moreover, white adipocytes in Fsp27(-/-) mice have reduced triglycerides accumulation and smaller lipid droplets, while levels of mitochondrial proteins, mitochondrial size and activity are dramatically increased. We further demonstrated that BAT-specific genes and key metabolic controlling factors such as FoxC2, PPAR and PGC1alpha were all markedly upregulated. In contrast, factors inhibiting BAT differentiation such as Rb, p107 and RIP140 were down-regulated in the WAT of Fsp27(-/-) mice. Remarkably, Fsp27(-/-) MEFs differentiated in vitro show many brown adipocyte characteristics in the presence of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3). Our data thus suggest that Fsp27 acts as a novel regulator in vivo to control WAT identity, mitochondrial activity and insulin sensitivity.",M1
18671859,"Weight loss and brown adipose tissue reduction in rat model of sleep apnea.BACKGROUND: Obesity is related to obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), but its roles in OSAHS as cause or consequence are not fully clarified. Isocapnic intermittent hypoxia (IIH) is a model of OSAHS. We verified the effect of IIH on body weight and brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) of Wistar rats. METHODS: Nine-month-old male breeders Wistar rats of two groups were studied: 8 rats submitted to IIH and 5 control rats submitted to sham IIH. The rats were weighed at the baseline and at the end of three weeks, after being placed in the IIH apparatus seven days per week, eight hours a day, in the lights on period, simulating an apnea index of 30/hour. After experimental period, the animals were weighed and measured as well as the BAT, abdominal, perirenal, and epididymal fat, the heart, and the gastrocnemius muscle. RESULTS: Body weight of the hypoxia group decreased 17 +/- 7 grams, significantly different from the variation observed in the control group (p = 0,001). The BAT was 15% lighter in the hypoxia group and reached marginally the alpha error probability (p = 0.054). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results justify a larger study for a longer time in order to confirm the effect of isocapnic intermittent hypoxia on body weight and BAT.",M1
18641690,"Fatty acid synthesis and generation of glycerol-3-phosphate in brown adipose tissue from rats fed a cafeteria diet.In vivo fatty acid synthesis and the pathways of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) production were investigated in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) from rats fed a cafeteria diet for 3 weeks. In spite of BAT activation, the diet promoted an increase in the carcass fatty acid content. Plasma insulin levels were markedly increased in cafeteria diet-fed rats. Two insulin-sensitive processes, in vivo fatty acid synthesis and in vivo glucose uptake (which was used to evaluate G3P generation via glycolysis) were increased in BAT from rats fed the cafeteria diet. Direct glycerol phosphorylation, evaluated by glycerokinase (GyK) activity and incorporation of [U-14C]glycerol into triacylglycerol (TAG)-glycerol, was also markedly increased in BAT from these rats. In contrast, the cafeteria diet induced a marked reduction of BAT glyceroneogenesis, evaluated by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-C activity and incorporation of [1-14C]pyruvate into TAG-glycerol. BAT denervation resulted in an approximately 50% reduction of GyK activity, but did not significantly affect BAT in vivo fatty acid synthesis, in vivo glucose uptake, or glyceroneogenesis. The data suggest that the supply of G3P for BAT TAG synthesis can be adjusted independently from the sympathetic nervous system and solely by reciprocal changes in the generation of G3P via glycolysis and via glyceroneogenesis, with no participation of direct phosphorylation of glycerol by GyK.",M1
18628400,"Transcriptional coactivators PGC-1alpha and PGC-lbeta control overlapping programs required for perinatal maturation of the heart.Oxidative tissues such as heart undergo a dramatic perinatal mitochondrial biogenesis to meet the high-energy demands after birth. PPARgamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1) alpha and beta have been implicated in the transcriptional control of cellular energy metabolism. Mice with combined deficiency of PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta (PGC-1alphabeta(-/-) mice) were generated to investigate the convergence of their functions in vivo. The phenotype of PGC-1beta(-/-) mice was minimal under nonstressed conditions, including normal heart function, similar to that of PGC-1alpha(-/-) mice generated previously. In striking contrast to the singly deficient PGC-1 lines, PGC-1alphabeta(-/-) mice died shortly after birth with small hearts, bradycardia, intermittent heart block, and a markedly reduced cardiac output. Cardiac-specific ablation of the PGC-1beta gene on a PGC-1alpha-deficient background phenocopied the generalized PGC-1alphabeta(-/-) mice. The hearts of the PGC-1alphabeta(-/-) mice exhibited signatures of a maturational defect including reduced growth, a late fetal arrest in mitochondrial biogenesis, and persistence of a fetal pattern of gene expression. Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) of PGC-1alphabeta(-/-) mice also exhibited a severe abnormality in function and mitochondrial density. We conclude that PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta share roles that collectively are necessary for the postnatal metabolic and functional maturation of heart and BAT.",M1
18599539,"Evidence of a role for melatonin in fetal sheep physiology: direct actions of melatonin on fetal cerebral artery, brown adipose tissue and adrenal gland.Although the fetal pineal gland does not secrete melatonin, the fetus is exposed to melatonin of maternal origin. In the non-human primate fetus, melatonin acts as a trophic hormone for the adrenal gland, stimulating growth while restraining cortisol production. This latter physiological activity led us to hypothesize that melatonin may influence some fetal functions critical for neonatal adaptation to extrauterine life. To test this hypothesis we explored (i) the presence of G-protein-coupled melatonin binding sites and (ii) the direct modulatory effects of melatonin on noradrenaline (norepinephrine)-induced middle cerebral artery (MCA) contraction, brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) lypolysis and ACTH-induced adrenal cortisol production in fetal sheep. We found that melatonin directly inhibits the response to noradrenaline in the MCA and BAT, and also inhibits the response to ACTH in the adrenal gland. Melatonin inhibition was reversed by the melatonin antagonist luzindole only in the fetal adrenal. MCA, BAT and adrenal tissue displayed specific high-affinity melatonin binding sites coupled to G-protein (K(d) values: MCA 64 +/- 1 pm, BAT 98.44 +/- 2.12 pm and adrenal 4.123 +/- 3.22 pm). Melatonin binding was displaced by luzindole only in the adrenal gland, supporting the idea that action in the MCA and BAT is mediated by different melatonin receptors. These direct inhibitory responses to melatonin support a role for melatonin in fetal physiology, which we propose prevents major contraction of cerebral vessels, restrains cortisol release and restricts BAT lypolysis during fetal life.",M1
18593740,"Renal contribution to thermolability in rats: role of renal nerves.BACKGROUND: Body temperature is closely regulated via the integration of a number of mechanisms, the study of which has been greatly assisted by the exploitation of comparative physiology. Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic renal failure patients have significantly lower body temperatures than healthy subjects when artifacts from circadian changes were taken into consideration. We hypothesize that the blunting of renal sensory neurons after kidney partial ablation may contribute to the lack of suppression of sympathetic efferent outflow towards <e>BAT</e>, modifying the glucose metabolism signaling pathway, UCP 1 expression and liver mitocondrial respiratory chain activity. METHODS: To evaluate the influence of renal mass reduction, renal denervation and chronic deafferentation by capsaicin on thermoregulation, glucose metabolism, UCP1 expression and liver mitocondrial respiration, was used respectively, the blocking of heat dissipation by thermoneutral body water immersion, the oxygen consumption by Clark-type electrode, and western blot method. RESULTS: The study confirmed that, following 5/6 nephrectomy, the basal core temperature of rats was significantly lower than that of control animals when maintained in a thermoneutral body water immersion recipient, as compared to controls. Additionally, we demonstrated that exposure of bilateral renal denervated or of renal chronic capsaicin-treated rats to a similar experimental protocol results in a fast and high rise in rectal temperature response, and this is associated with a significant increase in the basal serine phosphorylation and protein levels of Akt and protein levels of UCP1. This was observed despite unchanged liver mitochondria respiratory control and ADP/O ratios in 5/6 Nx, as well as DNx, when compared to control mitochondria. CONCLUSIONS: Speculatively, it may be suggested that one of the renal sensory nerve signal defects associated with decreased kidney energy generation, induced by kidney ablation, may result in an inability to control the body temperature.",M1
18593277,"Caloric restriction retards the age-related decline in mitochondrial function of brown adipose tissue.Caloric restriction (CR) has been shown to prevent the age-associated loss of mitochondrial function and biogenesis in several tissues such as liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. However, little is known about the effects of CR on a tissue in which the mitochondria have no adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-producing purpose but show a high degree of uncoupling, namely brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). Hence, the aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of long-term CR on BAT mitochondrial function and biogenesis. BAT mitochondria obtained from 24-month-old male and female rats previously subjected to 40% CR for 12 months were compared with mitochondria from old (24 months) and young (6 months) ad libitum fed rats. Old restricted rats compared to old ad libitum fed ones showed a reduction in BAT size with respect to fat content and adipocyte number. Mitochondrial DNA content in BAT increased with age and even more so in restricted rats, indicating a summative effect of age and CR on mitochondrial proliferation. CR induced resistance to lose total and mitochondrial protein, COX activity, and uncoupling capacity with advancing age, in relation with a lower decrease of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). In summary, our results demonstrate CR prevents the age-associated decline in mitochondrial function in BAT, probably in relation with a lower impairment of mitochondrial biogenesis.",M1
18539729,"The effect of acute exercise session on thyroid hormone economy in rats.The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is affected by acute exercise, but the mechanisms underlying thyroid function changes after exercise remain to be defined. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of a session of acute exercise on the treadmill at 75% of maximum oxygen consumption on thyroid function of rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: control (without exercise), and killed immediately after (0 min) or 30, 60, and 120 min after the end of the exercise session. A significant increase in serum tri-iodothyronine (T(3)) occurred immediately after the exercise, with a gradual decrease thereafter, so that 120 min after the end of the exercise, serum T(3) was significantly lower than that in controls. Total thyroxine (T(4)) increased progressively reaching values significantly higher than that in the control group at 120 min. T(3)/T(4) ratio was significantly decreased 60 and 120 min after the exercise, indicating impaired T(4)-to-T(3) conversion. Liver type 1 deiodinase activity (D1) significantly decreased at 60 and 120 min, while pituitary D1 increased progressively from 30 to 120 min after the exercise, and thyroid D1 was increased only immediately after the end of the exercise. Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) type 2 deiodinase activity (D2) was significantly lower at 30 min, but pituitary D2 remained unchanged. No change in serum thyrotropin was detected, while serum corticosterone was significantly higher 30 min after the exercise. Our results demonstrate that decreased liver D1 and BAT D2 might be involved in the decreased T(4)-to-T(3) conversion detected after an exercise session on the treadmill.",M1
18514405,"Day-night difference in thermoregulatory responses to olfactory stimulation.Previously, we observed that olfactory stimulation with scent of grapefruit oil (SGFO) or scent of lavender oil (SLVO) affected, elevated or lowered brown adipose tissue temperature (<e>BAT</e>-T) in conscious mice, respectively. In the present study, to test the day-night difference in the actions of olfactory stimulations, we examined the responses of BAT-T and body temperature (BT) measured as the abdominal temperature to SGFO or SLVO during day-time at 14:00 and night-time at 2:00 in conscious rats. In the light period, BAT-T and BT were suppressed after SLVO and elevated after SGFO whereas in the dark period, these parameters remained unchanged with olfactory stimulations. Bilateral lesions of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) eliminated the effects of olfactory stimulations with SGFO and SVLO on BAT-T and BT. Moreover, sympathetic nerve activity innervating brown adipose tissue (BAT-SNA) changes after SGFO or SLVO were abolished in SCN-lesioned rats. Thus, we concluded that there is day-night difference in the effects of SGFO or SLVO on BAT-T and BT, and that the SCN might be involved in these effects.",M1
18498040,"Brown adipose tissue demonstrating intense FDG uptake in a patient with mediastinal pheochromocytoma.We present an interesting case with a central mediastinal pheochromocytoma showing intense F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in tumor and systemic brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) mimicking metastases. The findings of hypertension and high plasma catecholamine concentration suggested the presence of pheochromocytoma. Mediastinal tumor showed intense FDG uptake and faint uptake of I-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine. Intense FDG uptake was demonstrated in cervical, paravertebral, mediastinal, and perirenal regions. Positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed uptake in a fat density area suggesting that the FDG uptake had occurred in BAT. The mediastinal tumor was resected along with an adhesion to the left atrial wall and pathologically confirmed as pheochromocytoma. The plasma catecholamine concentration and blood pressure then reverted to normal. The FDG uptake in BAT disappeared after tumor resection.",M1
18492776,"Thermogenically competent nonadrenergic recruitment in brown preadipocytes by a PPARgamma agonist.Most physiologically induced examples of recruitment of brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) occur as a consequence of chronic sympathetic stimulation (norepinephrine release within the tissue). However, in some physiological contexts (e.g., prenatal and prehibernation recruitment), this pathway is functionally contraindicated. Thus a nonsympathetically mediated mechanism of BAT recruitment must exist. Here we have tested whether a PPARgamma activation pathway could competently recruit BAT, independently of sympathetic stimulation. We continuously treated primary cultures of mouse brown (pre)adipocytes with the potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonist rosiglitazone. In rosiglitazone-treated cultures, morphological signs of adipose differentiation and expression levels of the general adipogenic marker aP2 were manifested much earlier than in control cultures. Importantly, in the presence of the PPARgamma agonist the brown adipocyte phenotype was significantly enhanced: UCP1 was expressed even in the absence of norepinephrine, and PPARalpha expression and norepinephrine-induced PGC-1alpha mRNA levels were significantly increased. However, the augmented levels of PPARalpha could not explain the brown-fat promoting effect of rosiglitazone, as this effect was still evident in PPARalpha-null cells. In continuously rosiglitazone-treated brown adipocytes, mitochondriogenesis, an essential part of BAT recruitment, was significantly enhanced. Most importantly, these mitochondria were capable of thermogenesis, as rosiglitazone-treated brown adipocytes responded to the addition of norepinephrine with a large increase in oxygen consumption. This thermogenic response was not observable in rosiglitazone-treated brown adipocytes originating from UCP1-ablated mice; hence, it was UCP1 dependent. Thus the PPARgamma pathway represents an alternative, potent, and fully competent mechanism for BAT recruitment, which may be the cellular explanation for the enigmatic recruitment in prehibernation and prenatal states.",M1
18479902,"Tea catechins enhance the mRNA expression of uncoupling protein 1 in rat brown adipose tissue.The aim of the present study was to determine whether the antiobesity effects of tea catechins (TCs) are associated with the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat (HF; 35% fat) diet for 5 weeks, then divided into four groups and fed an HF, HF with 0.5% TC (HFTC), normal-fat (NF; 5% fat) or NF with 0.5% TC (NFTC) diet for 8 weeks. At the end of the experimental period, perirenal and epididymal white adipose tissues (WATs) and interscapular BAT were isolated. The NFTC group had significantly lower perirenal WAT weights than the NF group (NF: 12.7+/-0.53 g; NFTC: 10.2+/-0.43 g; P&lt;.01), but the HF and HFTC groups did not differ significantly. TC intake had no effects on epididymal WAT weights. The NFTC and HFTC groups had significantly lower BAT weights than the NF and HF groups, respectively. The NFTC group had significantly higher UCP1 mRNA levels in BAT than the NF group (NF: 0.35+/-0.02; NFTC: 0.60+/-0.11; P&lt;.05), but the HF and HFTC groups did not differ significantly. Thus, TC intake in the context of the NF diet reduced perirenal WAT weight and up-regulated UCP1 mRNA expression in BAT. These results suggest that the suppressive effect of TC on body fat accumulation is associated with UCP1 expression in BAT.",M1
18467676,"Pharmacological effects of nicotine on norepinephrine metabolism in rat brown adipose tissue: relevance to nicotinic therapies for smoking cessation.In a two-year carcinogenicity study with administration of high doses of the partial nicotinic agonist varenicline (recently approved for smoking cessation), mediastinal hibernomas occurred in three male rats. To investigate potential mechanisms for partial and full nicotinic agonists to contribute to development of hibernomas, the effects of nicotine on rat brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) were studied. Male and female rats were administered nicotine at doses of 0, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg subcutaneously for fourteen days. Intrathoracic (mediastinal periaortic and mediastinal perithymic) BAT and interscapular BAT were examined microscopically, and determinations of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) expression and norepinephrine (NE) content were made. Additionally, NE turnover was measured in mediastinal periaortic and perithymic BAT. Nicotine (1 mg/kg) administration resulted in decreased vacuolation only in mediastinal periaortic and mediastinal perithymic BAT of males and elevated UCP-1 in mediastinal periaortic BAT of males and females. Increased NE content occurred only in mediastinal periaortic BAT of males given 0.3 and 1 mg/kg doses, whereas NE turnover was decreased in both males and females given 1 mg/kg. Together, these data demonstrate that nicotine primarily affects mediastinal BAT in male rats, consistent with the gender and location of the hibernomas observed in the two-year carcinogenicity study.",M1
18451493,"Cold-induced changes in gene expression in brown adipose tissue: implications for the activation of thermogenesis.Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) is the site of heat production (thermogenesis). This unique function is performed by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) specifically expressed in mitochondria of BAT. UCP1 dissipates the driving force of ATP synthesis, and thus causes heat production followed by energy expenditure. The thermogenic function of BAT has the role of maintaining body temperature under cold conditions. When animals are exposed to cold, the expression of UCP1 gene is increased to activate thermogenesis. To date, functional analysis of BAT has been focused on UCP1, because it plays an indispensable role in thermogenesis. However, the gene expression of not only UCP1 but also that of other genes in BAT is expected to be regulated to achieve effective thermogenesis. Our previous investigations showed increased expression of genes that encode several energy metabolic enzymes in the BAT of rats kept in the cold. These changes in gene expression imply that the enhancement of energy metabolism is needed to activate thermogenesis. Furthermore, various reports from studies focused on genes whose expression is changed in response to cold stimulation have provided new insights into the function of BAT. In this review, to understand the thermogenic function of BAT systematically, we have provided an overview of previous findings on changes in the expression of genes thought to be related to the activation of thermogenesis in BAT.",M1
18431153,"Potential false positive Tc-99m sestamibi parathyroid study due to uptake in brown adipose tissue.We report on a 55-year-old woman with suspected primary hyperparathyroidism who underwent dual phase Tc-99m sestamibi parathyroid imaging. Symmetric, patchy activity in the neck and shoulders was localized to low attenuation areas on integrated SPECT/CT and attributed to uptake in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). Focal uptake in the anterior thorax on SPECT images, which potentially may have been misinterpreted as ectopic parathyroid tissue, was demonstrated on SPECT/CT as uptake in BAT. Recognition of this pattern on parathyroid SPECT/CT scintigraphy may avoid false positive reports. Our case provides further evidence that in addition to F-18 FDG, I-123 MIBG, and Tc-99m tetrofosmin, Tc-99m sestamibi may also accumulate in BAT.",M1
18430862,"Method for decreasing uptake of 18F-FDG by hypermetabolic brown adipose tissue on PET.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether use of a high-fat, very-low-carbohydrate protocol for preparing patients for PET decreases the frequency of (18)F-FDG uptake by hypermetabolic brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) on PET scans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, 741 FDG PET/CT scans obtained during the winter months (October 1-April 30) for patients who prepared with a high-fat, very-low-carbohydrate, protein-permitted protocol were compared with 1,229 FDG PET scans obtained during the winter months for patients who prepared by fasting. FDG uptake on PET scans co-localized with regions of fat identified on the CT scans was assumed to represent hypermetabolic BAT. The categoric variables frequency of occurrence of hypermetabolic BAT (present or not) and the sex ratios of the groups before and after the change in preparation were compared by use of a chi-square test. The continuous variables of age and blood glucose level were compared by use of a two-tailed Student's t test. RESULTS: In this intention-to-treat analysis, there was no difference between the fasting (n = 1,229) and the high-fat, very-low-carbohydrate, protein-permitted diet (n = 741) groups in terms of age and sex. Patients who prepared with the high-fat diet had a significantly lower frequency of hypermetabolic BAT uptake on FDG PET scans during the winter months (p&lt;0.0002) and had lower blood glucose levels (p&lt;&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: In this intention-to-treat analysis, use of a high-fat preparation protocol significantly lowered the frequency of uptake of FDG by hypermetabolic BAT on FDG PET studies. Use of this protocol has the potential to decrease the rate of false-positive findings on oncologic FDG PET scans.",M1
18413387,"Visualization of brown adipose tissue with 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile on SPECT/CT.Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) is retained into adulthood in some patients. It has been imaged using several radiopharmaceuticals, including (18)F-FDG. Using SPECT/CT, we assessed whether and how frequently uptake of (99m)Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI) was present in expected locations of BAT. METHODS: A total of 205 SPECT/CT scans using (99m)Tc-MIBI for parathyroid imaging were reviewed for the presence of (99m)Tc-MIBI uptake in expected locations of BAT. RESULTS: We detected (99m)Tc-MIBI uptake in BAT in 13 of 205 patients (6.3%). When BAT was visualized, it was detected on both early and delayed scans. The patients with (99m)Tc-MIBI uptake in BAT were younger than the patients with no (99m)Tc-MIBI uptake (P=0.044). CONCLUSION: Uptake of (99m)Tc-MIBI in BAT is relatively common in this adult patient population and should not be confused with (99m)Tc-MIBI-avid-tumors. SPECT/CT can be useful for defining such tracer uptake as a normal physiologic variant.",M1
18354294,"Increased uncoupling protein 1 mRNA expression in mice brown adipose tissue after burn injury.Brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) contains numerous mitochondria and is characterized by the presence of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). UCP1 is the main mediator of thermogenesis that plays an important role in the modulation of energy balance. The authors hypothesize that alterations in the expression of UCP1 might be involved in the major metabolic disorders occurring during burn trauma. The present study is designed to explore the potential role of the UCP1 in metabolic disorders after burn injury. The authors have used the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to quantify UCP1 mRNA expression in the mice BAT and white adipose tissue (WAT). UCP1 mRNA expression was up-regulated in BAT, especially at 24 hours after burn. UCP1 mRNA expression was detectable and also up-regulated by burn injury in WAT. The authors provide evidence that one of the mechanisms mediating hypermetabolism and increased energy expenditure in burn injury is a pronounced increase in thermogenic capacity, as illustrated by robust gene expression of UCP1 in BAT and WAT.",M1
18321949,"Differential sympathetic drive to adipose tissues after food deprivation, cold exposure or glucoprivation.Surplus energy is principally stored in white adipose tissue (WAT) as triacylglycerol and mobilized via lipolysis through norepinephrine (NE) released from sympathetic nervous system terminals innervating WAT. We demonstrated that central melanocortin receptor agonism provokes differential sympathetic drives across WAT pads and interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT). Here we tested for differential WAT and IBAT sympathetic drive to known lipolytic stimuli {glucoprivation [2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG)], cold exposure (5 degrees C), food deprivation (16 h), or both cold exposure and food deprivation} by measuring NE turnover (NETO). Only inguinal WAT NETO significantly increased across all stimuli. Dorsal subcutaneous WAT NETO only increased with glucoprivation. Retroperitoneal WAT NETO increased with glucoprivation, cold and cold + food deprivation, but not by food deprivation. Epididymal WAT NETO was unaffected by glucoprivation but increased with cold, cold + food deprivation or food deprivation, but to a small significant degree. IBAT NETO was unaffected by glucoprivation or food deprivation, but increased with cold and cold + food deprivation. Plasma glucose decreased with food deprivation and increased with 2-DG administration or cold exposure. Plasma glycerol was increased with food deprivation, cold, and their combination but not with 2-DG, whereas plasma free fatty acids increased with food deprivation, cold + food deprivation, and 2-DG. These data show differential sympathetic drive to WAT and <e>BAT</e> for four different lipolytic stimuli, exemplifying the fat pad-specific pattern of WAT sympathetic drive across lipid-mobilizing conditions and emphasizing the need to analyze multiple adipose depots for measures of NETO and likely most measures.",M1
18321785,"Different physiological roles of serum leptin in the regulation of energy intake and thermogenesis between pregnancy and lactation in primiparous Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii).Reproduction, especially lactation, is associated with major metabolic adaptive changes. In this study, we investigated the metabolic changes and the roles of leptin during different periods of reproduction in primiparous Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii). Energy intake, thermogenic capacity and serum leptin levels were examined in non-reproductive, mid pregnant, late pregnant, early lactating and peak lactating voles. Voles increased body mass by nearly 70% during late pregnancy compared to the non-breeding controls. The increase in body mass was mainly due to the increase in body fat mass which increased by 56%, and the growth of the reproductive tissues and digestive organs. Lactating voles decreased body fat by nearly 27% at peak lactation compared to the controls, and 53% compared to late pregnant voles. At the same time they increased food intake significantly. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) content in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) decreased significantly at peak lactation. Serum leptin increased significantly in the mid pregnancy, at a time when there was no increase in body fat, and remained at this high level in late pregnancy. Leptin levels decreased after parturition and reached a nadir at peak lactation. Serum leptin was negatively correlated with energy intake during lactation, but not during pregnancy. These data suggest that Brandt's voles adjust energy intake, thermogenic capacity and body reserves to match the high energy demands for reproduction. Hyperleptinemia, without decreased energy intake suggests a state of leptin resistance during pregnancy, and hypoleptinemia during lactation might act as a signal to stimulate energy intake.",M1
18285526,"Thermogenic effect of triiodothyroacetic acid at low doses in rat adipose tissue without adverse side effects in the thyroid axis.Triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) is a physiological product of triiodothyronine (T(3)) metabolism, with high affinity for T(3) nuclear receptors. Its interest stems from its potential thermogenic effects. Thus this work aimed 1) to clarify these thermogenic effects mediated by TRIAC vs. T(3) in vivo and 2) to determine whether they occurred predominantly in adipose tissues. To examine this, control rats were infused with equimolar T(3) or TRIAC doses (0.8 or 4 nmolx100 g body wt(-1) x day(-1)) or exposed for 48 h to cold. Both T(3) doses and only the highest TRIAC dose inhibited plasma and pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T(4)) in plasma and tissues. Interestingly, the lower TRIAC dose marginally inhibited plasma T(4). T(3) infusion increased plasma and tissue T(3) in a tissue-specific manner. The highest TRIAC dose increased TRIAC concentrations in plasma and tissues, decreasing plasma T(3). TRIAC concentrations in tissues were &lt;10% those of T(3). Under cold exposure or high T(3) doses, TRIAC increased only in white adipose tissue (WAT). Remarkably, only the lower TRIAC dose activated thermogenesis, inducing ectopic uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 expression in WAT and maximal increases in UCP-1, UCP-2, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), inhibiting UCP-2 in muscle and LPL in WAT. TRIAC, T(3), and cold exposure inhibited leptin secretion and mRNA in WAT. In summary, TRIAC, at low doses, induces thermogenic effects in adipose tissues without concomitant inhibition of TSH or hypothyroxinemia, suggesting a specific role regulating energy balance. This selective effect of TRIAC in adipose tissues might be considered a potential tool to increase energy metabolism.",M1
18283466,"Large litter size increases maternal energy intake but has no effect on UCP1 content and serum-leptin concentrations in lactating Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii).Lactation is the most energetically demanding period in the female mammal's life. We measured maternal energy intake, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) content in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), serum-leptin concentration, and litter growth in lactating Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) with different litter sizes. Litter mass was positively related to litter size but there was no difference in pup mass at birth. Maternal gross energy intake at peak lactation was positively correlated with litter size and litter mass. Maternal resting metabolic rate (RMR) was positively correlated with litter mass, but not with litter size. No significant differences were detected in body-fat mass, serum-leptin concentration, or UCP1 in lactating voles with different litter sizes. Serum-leptin concentration was negatively correlated with energy intake during lactation. Our data did not support the hypothesis that there is a trade-off in energy allocation between maternal maintenance and offspring growth in lactating Brandt's voles, but support the idea that if the mothers with ten pups should have less energy available for their maintenance than mothers raising fewer pups. Also, leptin is probably not the only factor that induces the high energy intake in mothers with large litter sizes, although it was involved in the regulation of energy intake during lactation.",M1
18283283,"Effects of leptin on energy metabolism in beta-less mice.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of beta-adrenoceptor deficiency on the metabolic effects of leptin. MEASUREMENTS: Leptin was infused subcutaneously through an osmotic minipump in wild-type (WT) and beta(1)/beta(2)/beta(3)-adrenoceptor knockout (beta-less) mice and its effects on food intake, energy expenditure, carbohydrate and lipid utilization as well as on the levels of expression of the brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), thermogenic marker uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) and type II deiodinase (D2) mRNAs were compared. RESULTS: Leptin treatment decreased food intake by 23% in both the WT and the beta-less mice. In pair-fed animals being used as controls, leptin treatment was found to increase energy expenditure in WT, but not in beta-less mice. No difference was observed in carbohydrate or fat utilization between leptin-treated WT and beta-less mice. Leptin increased UCP1 and D2 mRNA levels in WT mouse BAT 1.7- and 3-fold, respectively, but had no effect on the expression of these genes in beta-less mouse BAT. CONCLUSION: The stimulatory effects of leptin on oxygen consumption, BAT UCP1 and D2 expression require functional beta-adrenoceptors, but its inhibitory effect on food intake and its stimulatory effect on fat utilization is independent of the beta-adrenoceptor signalling.",M1
18269181,"Cide proteins and the development of obesity.Obesity has become the most prevalent chronic disorder that affects large populations throughout the world. Obesity is due largely to the imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. Energy balance is regulated by interactions between various tissues such as adipose tissues, liver and skeletal muscle. Adipose tissues, which include brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) and white adipose tissue (WAT), play crucial roles in maintaining energy homeostasis. While WAT stores energy in the form of triglycerides; BAT increases energy expenditure through thermogenesis. Cide proteins including Cidea, Cideb and Fsp27, are expressed at high levels in BAT, liver and WAT, respectively. Cidea(-/-) mice exhibit increased lipolysis in BAT and are resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes. Our recent data suggest that Cideb also plays an important role in the development of obesity by regulating various metabolic pathways in liver. The molecular mechanism of Cide protein regulation of metabolic networks and obesity is discussed.",M1
18262576,"Relationship between taste-induced physiological reflexes and temperature of sweet taste.Excessive consumption of soft drinks has been argued as a key contributor to the epidemic of obesity in modern society. This is because they are characterized by high content of sugar, low satiety, and incomplete compensation for total energy. However, since obesity involves complex interactions of various factors, there must be more indices to link soft drink consumption and development of obesity. In this study, we have concentrated on the taste component of soft drinks and how they are consumed. We particularly investigated the temperature dependence of the indices associated with glucose metabolism such as cephalic phase insulin release and sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) of brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) to sweet solution since soft drinks are usually consumed in very cold temperature. Glucose solution incubated at room temperature (warm; 25 degrees C) or refrigerated to 4 degrees C (cold) was administered to the rats and significant rise in plasma insulin was observed at 3rd min in warm group while it was not increased until 15th min in cold group. The initial rise in plasma insulin did not coincide with a rise in blood glucose in warm group. Under the anesthesia, warm glucose solution significantly enhanced SNA of BAT while cold glucose solution exhibited no difference. The nerve response of chorda tympani also showed greater response to warm glucose solution than cold glucose solution. These results suggest that cold sweet taste stimulus does not accompany expected taste-induced physiological reflexes, possibly retarding organisms' energy expenditure system.",M1
18239634,"Effects of IL-15 on rat brown adipose tissue: uncoupling proteins and PPARs.OBJECTIVES: Interleukin-15 (IL-15) plays an important role in lipid metabolism as its administration to rats causes a marked depletion of white adipose tissue (WAT). This reduction in fat mass seems to be caused by and related to hipotriglyceridemia as a result of a lower hepatic lipogenesis and an increased fatty acid oxidation. We have previously observed that IL-15 treatment induces the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) in muscle. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IL-15 on brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), and in particular on genes related to lipid metabolism in this tissue. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Male Wistar rats were treated daily with IL-15 for 7 days. Adipose tissues were collected and the mRNA content of UCPs, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and several genes implicated in fatty acid transport and oxidation were evaluated on BAT. RESULTS: IL-15 treatment in rats causes a decrease in the mass of both WAT and BAT (35 and 24%, respectively). In BAT, an important upregulation of the mRNA content of thermogenic proteins (UCP1 and UCP3), lipid-related transcription factors (PPARdelta and PPARalpha) and other proteins implicated in membrane transport (fatty acid translocase (FAT) and fatty acid transport protein (FATP)), mitochondrial transport (carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I (CPT-I) and CPT-II) and consumption (acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACS4)) of fatty acids was observed as a consequence of the treatment. DISCUSSION: The changes observed in BAT suggest that IL-15 could be implicated in lipid consumption in this tissue by regulating lipid oxidation and probably thermogenesis, processes mediated by UCPs and PPARs.",M1
18198308,"Quantitative trait Loci for regional adiposity in mouse lines divergently selected for food intake.OBJECTIVE: Obesity is thought to result from an interaction between genotype and environment. Excessive adiposity is associated with a number of important comorbidities; however, the risk of obesity-related disease varies with the distribution of fat throughout the body. The aim of this study was to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with regional fat depots in mouse lines divergently selected for food intake corrected for body mass. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Using an F2 intercross design (n = 457), the dry mass of regional white (subcutaneous, gonadal, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric) adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) depots were analyzed to map QTLs. RESULTS: The total variance explained by the mapped QTL varied between 12% and 39% for BAT and gonadal fat depots, respectively. Using the genome-wide significance threshold, nine QTLs were associated with multiple fat depots. Chromosomes 4 and 19 were associated with WAT and BAT and chromosome 9 with WAT depots. Significant sex x QTL interactions were identified for gonadal fat on chromosomes 9, 16, and 19. The pattern of QTLs identified for the regional deposits showed the most similarity between retroperitoneal and gonadal fat, whereas BAT showed the least similarity to the WAT depots. Analysis of total fat mass explained in excess of 40% of total variance. DISCUSSION: There was limited concordance between the QTLs mapped in our study and those reported previously. This is likely to reflect the unique nature of the mouse lines used. Results provide an insight into the genetic basis of regional fat distribution.",M1
18175912,"Up-regulation of genes related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the brown adipose tissue of 24-h-fasted rats.The functional balance between brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) and white adipose tissue (WAT) is important for metabolic homeostasis. We compared the effects of fasting on the gene expression profiles in BAT, WAT and liver by using a DNA microarray analysis. Tissues were obtained from rats that had been fed or fasted for 24 h. Taking the false discovery rate into account, we extracted the top 1,000 genes that had been differentially expressed between the fed and fasted rats. In all three tissues, a Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the lipid and protein biosynthesis-related genes had been markedly down-regulated. The whole-body fuel shift from glucose to triacylglycerol and the induction of autophagy were also observed. There was marked up-regulation of genes in the 'protein ubiquitination' category particularly in BAT of the fasted rats, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome system was involved in saving energy as an adaptation to food shortage.",M1
18157529,"Temporal relation between temperature change and FDG uptake in brown adipose tissue.OBJECTIVES: It has been reported that the prevalence of (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) is related to outdoor temperature, i.e., more frequent during the colder periods of the year. The purpose of this study was to assess the temporal relationship between BAT FDG uptake and temperature. We correlated the prevalence of BAT with average temperatures (divided into five temperature ranges) of seven different durations. METHODS: One thousand four hundred ninety-five consecutive FDG Positron emission tomography (PET) studies in 1,159 patients (566 male and 593 female, mean age = 60.4 years) were retrospectively reviewed. FDG uptake with distinct patterns compatible with BAT was identified by a consensus of two readers. The local daily average temperature from January 2000 to November 2003 (beginning 60 days before the date of first PET scan) were obtained, and 2-, 3-, 7-, 14-, 30-, and 60-day average temperatures before the date of a PET study were calculated. The prevalence of BAT FDG uptake was correlated with these various average temperatures. RESULTS: The daily, 2-day, 3-day, and 7-day average temperature had an inverse relation with the prevalence of BAT, i.e., the lower the temperature, the higher prevalence of BAT. When the temperature was averaged over 14 days or longer, this inverse relationship between the temperature and the prevalence of BAT was no longer preserved. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that increased FDG uptake in BAT occurs more often as an acute response to cold weather (1-7 days) rather than to prolonged periods of average cold weather.",M1
18085886,"Rat behavioral thermoregulation integrates with nonshivering thermogenesis during postnatal development.Rat pups are capable of behavioral thermoregulation, both in the nest and on a thermocline, as early as the 1st week of postnatal life, and these pups can also produce heat metabolically without shivering. The rat pup's primary source of nonshivering thermogenesis is the sympathetically mediated metabolism of brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>). BAT is well formed in newborns and functions shortly after birth. While infant behavioral thermoregulation and BAT thermogenesis have been extensively studied, little is known about the extent to which thermoregulatory behavior can be influenced by BAT thermogenesis. In the present study, 2-, 7-, and 14-day-old pups were observed on a thermal gradient following pharmacological stimulation or inhibition of BAT thermogenesis, and their thermal preferences were quantified. The authors found that 7- and 14-day-old pups treated with norepinephrine (NE), which increases BAT thermogenesis, preferred cooler portions of the gradient than saline-treated controls, whereas 2-day-olds failed to show a similar NE-induced behavioral adjustment. These findings indicate that the ability to adjust thermoregulatory behavior to compensate for enhanced metabolic thermogenesis develops during the 1st week of postnatal life.",M1
18082230,"Brown adipose tissue sympathetic nerve activity is potentiated by activation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A/5-HT7 receptors in the rat spinal cord.In urethane-chloralose anesthetized, neuromuscularly blocked, ventilated rats, microinjection of NMDA (12 pmol) into the right fourth thoracic segment (T4) spinal intermediolateral nucleus (IML) immediately increased ipsilateral brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) sympathetic nerve activity (SNA; peak +492% of control), expired CO2 (+0.1%) heart rate (+48 beats min(-1)) and arterial pressure (+8 mmHg). The increase in BAT SNA evoked by T4 IML microinjection of NMDA was potentiated when it was administered immediately following a T4 IML microinjection of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 100 pmol) or the 5-HT1A/5-HT7 receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (600 pmol), (area under the curve: 184%, and 259% of the NMDA-only response, respectively). In contrast, T4 IML microinjection of the 5-HT2 receptor agonist, DOI (28 pmol) did not potentiate the NMDA-evoked increase in BAT SNA (101% of NMDA-only response). Microinjection into the T4 IML of the selective 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY-100635 (500 pmol), plus the 5-HT7 antagonist, SB-269970 (500 pmol), prevented the 5-HT-induced potentiation of the NMDA-evoked increase in BAT SNA. When administered separately, WAY-100635 (800 pmol) and SB-269970 (800 pmol) attenuated the 8-OH-DPAT-induced potentiation of the NMDA-evoked increase in BAT SNA through effects on the amplitude and duration of the response, respectively. The selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin (100 pmol), did not attenuate the potentiations of the NMDA-evoked increase in BAT SNA induced by either 5-HT or 8-OH-DPAT. These results demonstrate that activation of 5-HT1A/5-HT7 receptors can act synergistically with NMDA receptor activation within the IML to markedly increase BAT SNA.",M1
18054313,"Enhanced leptin-stimulated Pi3k activation in the CNS promotes white adipose tissue transdifferentiation.The contribution of different leptin-induced signaling pathways in control of energy homeostasis is only partly understood. Here we show that selective Pten ablation in leptin-sensitive neurons (Pten(DeltaObRb)) results in enhanced Pi3k activation in these cells and reduces adiposity by increasing energy expenditure. White adipose tissue (WAT) of Pten(DeltaObRb) mice shows characteristics of brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>), reflected by increased mitochondrial content and Ucp1 expression resulting from enhanced leptin-stimulated sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in WAT. In contrast, leptin-deficient ob/ob-Pten(DeltaObRb) mice exhibit unaltered body weight and WAT morphology compared to ob/ob mice, pointing to a pivotal role of endogenous leptin in control of WAT transdifferentiation. Leanness of Pten(DeltaObRb) mice is accompanied by enhanced sensitivity to insulin in skeletal muscle. These data provide direct genetic evidence that leptin-stimulated Pi3k signaling in the CNS regulates energy expenditure via activation of SNA to perigonadal WAT leading to BAT-like differentiation of WAT.",M1
18036333,"Synchronized changes in transcript levels of genes activating cold exposure-induced thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue of experimental animals.To identify genes whose expression in brown adipose tissue (<e>BAT</e>) is up- or down-regulated in cold-exposed rats, we performed microarray analysis of RNA samples prepared from the BAT of cold-exposed rats and of rats kept at room temperature. Previously reported elevations of transcript levels of uncoupling protein (UCP1), type II iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO2), and type III adenylate cyclase (AC3) in the BAT of cold-exposed rats over those in that of rats maintained at room temperature were confirmed. In addition to these changes, remarkable elevations of the transcript levels of several genes that seemed to be associated with the processes of cell-cycle regulation and DNA replication were detected in the BAT of cold-exposed rats, possibly reflecting the significant proliferation of brown adipocytes in response to cold exposure. Up-regulation of the gene encoding sarcomeric mitochondrial type creatine kinase in the BAT of cold-exposed rats was also detected by microarray analysis, but subsequent Northern analysis revealed that the expression of not only the sarcomeric mitochondrial type enzyme, but also that of 2 other subtypes, i.e., cytoplasmic brain type and cytoplasmic muscle type, was elevated in the BAT of cold-exposed rats. Microarray analysis also revealed a significant expression of myoglobin in BAT and its elevation in the BAT of cold-exposed rats, and this result was supported by calibrated Northern analysis. On the contrary, several genes such as regulator of G-protein signaling 2 and IMP dehydrogenase 1 were down-regulated in the BAT of cold-exposed rats. The physiological meaning of these changes accompanying cold exposure was discussed.",M1

Twenty-six positive brain samples were selected, 80% of which were from the Brazilian free-tailed bat, Tadarida brasiliensis, corresponding to the period 1999-2005. Antigenic characterisation was conducted on a panel of 19 monoclonal antibodies targeting the rabies virus nucleoprotein supplied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta in the United States of America. The results revealed a high percentage of isolations in salivary glands (76.9%). Their average titres were compared in a batch of positive samples of brain and salivary glands, giving values of 4.75 and 3.81 respectively (expressed as log LD50/0.03 ml). The isolated viruses corresponded principally to variant 4 associated with T brasiliensis and variant 6 associated with the hoary bat, Lasiurus cinereus, and the red bat, L. borealis, and their respective subvariants. The level of exposure in domestic animals and humans was 50% during the period under study.",M2
20443691,"Co-distribution of glycoconjugates and H(+), K(+)-ATPase in the parietal cells of the greater horseshoe <e>bat</e>, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (Schreber, 1774).Histochemical, lectin-histochemical, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on parietal cells of the greater horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, to clarify the composition and distribution of oligosaccharide chains in the beta-subunit of the protonic pump H(+),K(+)-ATPase. PAS, Alcian Blue (pH 2.5) and Alcian Blue (pH 1.0) stainings detected only neutral glycoconjugates. Lectin-binding analyses included LTA, UEA-I, ConA, SBA, BSI-B4, AAA, DBA, PNA, and WGA. WGA-and PNA-bindings were also tested after beta-elimination to detect O-linked glycans. Parietal cells were negative for binding to LTA and UEA-I, and to PNA and WGA after beta-elimination, indicating the lack of (1,2) fucosylated residues and of N-linked glycans, respectively. Immunohistochemical tests with anti-alpha- and anti-beta-H(+),K(+)-ATPase were positive. Two alternative patterns of glycoconjugate distribution were found, i.e. a perinuclear and a diffuse one, indicating localization in the intracellular canaliculus and in the tubulovesicular system of the parietal cells, respectively. Both the subunits of the H(+),K(+)-ATPase and the galactosyl/galactosaminyl residues were co-distributed in both the perinuclear and the diffuse patterns, suggesting that the residues are part of the protonic pump. Glycosyl/glycosaminyl and mannosyl groups were concentrated in the tubulovesicular system, and fucosylated residues were found almost exclusively in the intracellular canaliculi; thus they are probably not included in the oligosaccharide chains of beta-H(+),K(+)-ATPase. These findings indicate that the oligosaccharide chains linked to the beta-H(+),K(+)-ATPase subunit in R. ferrumequinum have distinct features compared to the other mammals studied and confirms the taxon specificity of the chains in the proton pump.",M2
20433686,"Cryptic diversity of the bent-wing <e>bat</e>, Miniopterus schreibersii (Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae), in Asia Minor.BACKGROUND: Two or more species are cryptic, if they are morphologically similar, biologically distinct, and misclassified as a single species. Cryptic species complexes were recently discovered within many bat species and we suspect that the bent-wing bat, Miniopterus schreibersii, found in Europe, northern Africa, and Asia Minor, could also form such a complex. Populations of M. schreibersii decline in most of the European countries and the species is currently listed as Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List. Finding that M. schreibersii is not a single species, but a species complex, would have a considerable impact on its conservation strategies, as the abundance of each component taxon would be much smaller than the one estimated for the nominal species. RESULTS: Miniopterus schreibersii in Asia Minor consists of two genetically diverged lineages, which are reciprocally monophyletic on three mitochondrial DNA markers, have a diagnostic set of multilocus allele frequencies, and show a marked difference in their population structures. The lineages differ slightly in their size, wing shape, and echolocation call parameters. Although these differences are sufficient to discriminate between the lineages, they are not fully diagnostic in reference to individuals. We suggest that the lineages endured the major Northern Hemisphere glaciations in different glacial refugia and colonized Asia Minor after the last glacial maximum. The lineages are allopatric, which is neither delineated by the presence of geographical barriers nor associated with the specific climatic conditions, and which we link to competitive exclusion. CONCLUSIONS: The distinctions between the lineages comply with most of the criteria required for species delineation imposed by various species concepts. Accordingly, we conclude that M. schreibersii in Asia Minor is represented by two cryptic species. Our results imply that the distributional range of the nominal species is almost exclusively limited to Europe and the coastal zones of Asia Minor. As populations of M. schreibersii seem to be much smaller than currently assumed, conservation strategies regarding this taxon need to be revised. The exact distributional range and the vulnerability of the suggested sister species to M. schreibersii is yet to be assessed.",M2
20421465,"Adaptive evolution of energy metabolism genes and the origin of flight in <e>bats</e>.Bat flight poses intriguing questions about how flight independently developed in mammals. Flight is among the most energy-consuming activities. Thus, we deduced that changes in energy metabolism must be a primary factor in the origin of flight in bats. The respiratory chain of the mitochondrial produces 95% of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) needed for locomotion. Because the respiratory chain has a dual genetic foundation, with genes encoded by both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, we examined both genomes to gain insights into the evolution of flight within mammals. Evidence for positive selection was detected in 23.08% of the mitochondrial-encoded and 4.90% of nuclear-encoded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, but in only 2.25% of the nuclear-encoded nonrespiratory genes that function in mitochondria or 1.005% of other nuclear genes in bats. To address the caveat that the two available bat genomes are of only draft quality, we resequenced 77 OXPHOS genes from four species of bats. The analysis of the resequenced gene data are in agreement with our conclusion that a significantly higher proportion of genes involved in energy metabolism, compared with background genes, show evidence of adaptive evolution specific on the common ancestral bat lineage. Both mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes display evidence of adaptive evolution along the common ancestral branch of bats, supporting our hypothesis that genes involved in energy metabolism were targets of natural selection and allowed adaptation to the huge change in energy demand that were required during the origin of flight.",M2
20406605,"Rabies in Latin America.OBJECTIVE: To review and discuss the available literature for rabies control in Latin America. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed through October 2008. Articles in English, Spanish and Portuguese were reviewed. RESULTS: Recent reports indicate that the region is close to achieve the goal of eliminating human rabies transmitted by dogs even though there are some isolated cases reported. However, insectivorous and vampire <e>bats</e> continue to expose humans and animals. These cases have been reported with increasing frequency. DISCUSSION: Many challenges to the successful eradication of canine and non-canine rabies have been identified: among these are issues related to vaccine supply, the increase in transmission of canine rabies in certain areas, the presence of bat rabies in geographically inaccessible areas and lack of active action at local level. New strategies for systems information, networking and education are needed. Effective decentralization, adequate reallocation of resources, constant active surveillance, active local community participation and aggressive health education, might be some of the strategies that could prove to be helpful. More investment (funding and resources) and a very strong political commitment are needed to be able to eradicate this deadly disease.",M2
20379132,"Human rabies - Kentucky/Indiana, 2009.On October 19, 2009, clinicians from Kentucky contacted CDC regarding a suspected case of rabies in a man from Indiana aged 43 years. This report summarizes the patient's clinical presentation and course, the subsequent epidemiologic investigation, and, for the first time, provides infection control recommendations for personnel performing autopsies on decedents with confirmed or suspected rabies infection. Before the patient's death on October 20, a diagnosis of rabies was suspected based on the history of acute, progressive encephalitis with unknown etiology. Preliminary serology results on antemortem serum samples detected rabies virus-specific antibodies. Because local pathologists were concerned about the biosafety risk posed by infectious aerosols at autopsy and potential contamination of autopsy facilities, the Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) asked CDC staff members to travel to Kentucky and perform an autopsy to confirm the diagnosis and assist with the epidemiologic investigation. Testing of autopsy samples was conducted at CDC and detected rabies virus antigens in brainstem and cerebellum. Rabies viral RNA was isolated and typed as a variant common to the tricolored <e>bat</e> (Perimyotis subflavus). Although rabies virus transmission from organ or tissue transplant has been documented rarely, transmission of rabies virus to persons performing autopsies has not been reported.

20357054,"Detection of Latin American strains of Histoplasma in a murine model by use of a commercially available antigen test.During a Histoplasma outbreak in a colony of fruit <e>bats</e> at a southern United States zoo, it was observed that although Histoplasma was recovered in culture from multiple sites at necropsy, none of the samples collected from those bats tested positive for Histoplasma antigen (HAg). Five of the Histoplasma isolates from the bats were subsequently identified as Latin American (LA) clade A, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) class 6. These observations raised concern as to whether the commercially available HAg test could detect Histoplasma antigen not of the North American clade upon which the HAg test had been developed. To evaluate this concern, a murine model of disseminated histoplasmosis was established, and mice were infected with multiple LA Histoplasma isolates, including clinical isolates recovered from Brazilian AIDS patients (RFLP class 5 and class 6) and isolates recovered from the bats during the outbreak (RFLP class 6). Histoplasma antigen was detected in all infected mice in our experiments, even when Histoplasma was not recovered in culture. Because the currently available HAg test is able to detect Histoplasma antigen in mice infected with Latin American isolates, this suggests that bat host factors rather than differences among Histoplasma RFLP classes were responsible for the inability to detect HAg in infected bats.",M2
20351296,"A nocturnal mammal, the greater mouse-eared <e>bat</e>, calibrates a magnetic compass by the sun.Recent evidence suggests that bats can detect the geomagnetic field, but the way in which this is used by them for navigation to a home roost remains unresolved. The geomagnetic field may be used by animals both to indicate direction and to locate position. In birds, directional information appears to be derived from an interaction of the magnetic field with either the sun or the stars, with some evidence suggesting that sunset/sunrise provides the primary directional reference by which a magnetic compass is calibrated daily. We demonstrate that homing greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) calibrate a magnetic compass with sunset cues by testing their homing response after exposure to an altered magnetic field at and after sunset. Magnetic manipulation at sunset resulted in a counterclockwise shift in orientation compared with controls, consistent with sunset calibration of the magnetic field, whereas magnetic manipulation after sunset resulted in no change in orientation. Unlike in birds, however, the pattern of polarization was not necessary for the calibration. For animals that occupy ecological niches where the sunset is rarely observed, this is a surprising finding. Yet it may indicate the primacy of the sun as an absolute geographical reference not only for birds but also within other vertebrate taxa.",M2
20351291,"FM echolocating <e>bats</e> shift frequencies to avoid broadcast-echo ambiguity in clutter.Sonar broadcasts are followed by echoes at different delays from objects at different distances. When broadcasts are emitted rapidly in cluttered surroundings, echo streams from successive broadcasts overlap and cause ambiguity in matching echoes to corresponding broadcasts. To identify reactions to ambiguity in clutter, echolocating bats that emit multiple-harmonic FM sounds were trained to fly into a dense, extended array of obstacles (multiple rows of vertically hanging chains) while the sonar sounds the bat emitted were recorded with a miniature radio microphone carried by the bat. Flight paths were reconstructed from thermal-infrared video recordings. Successive rows of chains extended more than 6 m in depth, so each broadcast was followed by a series of echoes from multiple rows of chains that lasted up to 40 ms. Bats emitted sounds in pairs ( strobe groups ) at short (20-40 ms) interpulse intervals (IPIs) alternating with longer IPIs (&gt;50 ms). For many short IPIs, the stream of echoes from the first broadcast was still arriving when the second broadcast was emitted. This overlap caused ambiguity about matching echoes with broadcasts. Bats shifted frequencies of the first sound in each strobe group upward and the second sound downward by 3-6 kHz. When overlap and ambiguity ceased, frequency shifts ceased also. Frequency differences were small compared with the total broadcast band, which was 75-80 kHz wide, but the harmonic structure of echoes enhances the differences in spectrograms. Bats could use time-frequency comparisons of echoes with broadcasts to assign echoes to the corresponding broadcasts and thus avoid ambiguity.",M2
20350736,"Broome virus, a new fusogenic Orthoreovirus species isolated from an Australian fruit <e>bat</e>.This report describes the discovery and characterization of a new fusogenic orthoreovirus, Broome virus (BroV), isolated from a little red flying-fox (Pteropus scapulatus). The BroV genome consists of 10 dsRNA segments, each having a 3' terminal pentanucleotide sequence conserved amongst all members of the genus Orthoreovirus, and a unique 5' terminal pentanucleotide sequence. The smallest genome segment is bicistronic and encodes two small nonstructural proteins, one of which is a novel fusion associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein responsible for syncytium formation, but no cell attachment protein. The low amino acid sequence identity between BroV proteins and those of other orthoreoviruses (13-50%), combined with phylogenetic analyses of structural and nonstructural proteins provide evidence to support the classification of BroV in a new sixth species group within the genus Orthoreovirus.",M2
20335495,"Identification of key amino acid residues required for horseshoe <e>bat</e> angiotensin-I converting enzyme 2 to function as a receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.Angiotensin-I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A previous study indicated that ACE2 from a horseshoe bat, the host of a highly related SARS-like coronavirus, could not function as a receptor for SARS-CoV. Here, we demonstrate that a 3 aa change from SHE (aa 40-42) to FYQ was sufficient to convert the bat ACE2 into a fully functional receptor for SARS-CoV. We further demonstrate that an ACE2 molecule from a fruit bat, which contains the FYQ motif, was able to support SARS-CoV infection, indicating a potentially much wider host range for SARS-CoV-related viruses among different bat populations.",M2
20298473,"Historical male-mediated introgression in horseshoe <e>bats</e> revealed by multilocus DNA sequence data.Instances of hybridization between mammalian taxa in the wild are rarely documented. To test for introgression between sibling species of horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus yunanensis and R. pearsoni) and two subspecies of the latter (R. p. pearsoni and R. p. chinensis), we sequenced two mtDNA and two ncDNA markers in individuals sampled from multiple localities within their overlapping ranges. The interspecific mtDNA gene tree corresponded to the expected taxonomic divisions, and coalescent-based analyses suggested divergence occurred around 4 MYA. However, these relationships strongly conflicted with those recovered from two independent nuclear gene trees, in which R. yunanensis clustered with R. p. pearsoni to the exclusion of R. p. chinensis. This geographically widespread discordance is best explained by large-scale historical introgression of ncDNA from R. yunanensis to R. pearsoni by male-mediated exchange in mixed species colonies during Pleistocene glacial periods, when ranges may have contracted and overlapped more than at present. Further species tree-gene tree conflicts were detected between R. p. pearsoni and R. p. chinensis, also indicating past and/or current introgression in their overlapping regions. However, here the patterns point to asymmetric mtDNA introgression without ncDNA introgression. Analyses of coalescence times indicate this exchange has occurred subsequent to the divergence of these subspecies from their common ancestor. Our work highlights the importance of using multiple data sets for reconstructing phylogeographic histories and resolving taxonomic relationships.",M2
20237786,"Auditory-based defence against gleaning <e>bats</e> in neotropical katydids (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae).Neotropical katydids (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) are preyed on by gleaning bats, which are known to use male calling songs to locate them. At least one katydid species has been reported to stop singing in response to bat echolocation calls. To investigate the relationship between this behavioural defence and ecological and sensory factors, we surveyed calling song characteristics, song cessation in response to the echolocation calls of a sympatric gleaning bat (Trachops cirrhosus), and T-cell responses (an auditory interneuron sensitive to ultrasound) in five katydid species from Panamá. The two katydid species that stopped singing in response to bat calls (Balboa tibialis and Ischnomela gracilis, Pseudophyllinae) also had the highest T-cell spike number and rate in response to these stimuli. The third pseudophylline species (Docidocercus gigliotosi) did not reliably cease singing and had low T-cell spiking activity. Neoconocephalus affinis (Copiphorinae) produced continuous calling song, possibly preventing males from hearing the bat during singing, and did not show a behavioural response despite high T-cell activity in response to bat calls. Steirodon rufolineatum (Phaneropterinae) did not cease singing and differed in T-cell activity compared to the other species. T-cell function might not be conserved in katydids, and evidence for this idea is discussed.",M2

The lower limits of detection for PCR were 5 fg of purified fungal DNA or 100 conidia per 2 mg of wing tissue. By using histology as the standard, the PCR had a diagnostic specificity of 100% and a diagnostic sensitivity of 96%, whereas the diagnostic sensitivity of culture techniques was only 54%. The accuracy and fast turnaround time of PCR provides field biologists with valuable information on infection status more rapidly than traditional methods, and the small amount of tissue required for the test would allow diagnosis of white-nose syndrome in live animals.",M2
20217155,"Identification of SARS-like coronaviruses in horseshoe <e>bats</e> (Rhinolophus hipposideros) in Slovenia.Bats have been identified as a natural reservoir for an increasing number of emerging zoonotic viruses, such as Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, rabies and other lyssaviruses. Recently, a large number of viruses closely related to members of the genus Coronavirus have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and detected in bat species. In this study, samples were collected from 106 live bats of seven different bat species from 27 different locations in Slovenia. Coronaviruses were detected by RT-PCR in 14 out of 36 horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) fecal samples, with 38.8% virus prevalence. Sequence analysis of a 405-nucleotide region of the highly conserved RNA polymerase gene (pol) showed that all coronaviruses detected in this study are genetically closely related, with 99.5-100% nucleotide identity, and belong to group 2 of the coronaviruses. The most closely related virus sequence in GenBank was SARS bat isolate Rp3/2004 (DQ071615) within the SARS-like CoV cluster, sharing 85% nucleotide identity and 95.6% amino acid identity. The potential risk of a new group of bat coronaviruses as a reservoir for human infections is highly suspected, and further molecular epidemiologic studies of these bat coronaviruses are needed.",M2
20204397,"On population encoding and decoding of auditory information for <e>bat</e> echolocation.In this article, we study the neural encoding of acoustic information for FM-bats (such as Eptesicus fuscus) in simulation. In echolocation research, the frequency-time sound representation as expressed by the spectrogram is often considered as input. The rationale behind this is that a similar representation is present in the cochlea, i.e. the receptor potential of the inner hair cells (IHC) along the length of the cochlea, and hence similar acoustic information is relayed to the brain. In this article, we study to what extent the latter assumption is true. The receptor potential is converted into neural activity of the synapting auditory nerve cells (ANC), and information might be lost in this conversion process. Especially for FM-bats, this information transmission is not trivial: in contrast to other mammals, they detect short transient signals, and consequently neural activity can only be integrated over very limited time intervals. To quantify the amount of information transmitted we design a neural network-based algorithm to reconstruct the IHC receptor potentials from the spiking activity of the synapting auditory neurons. Both the receptor potential and the resulting neural activity are simulated using Meddis' peripheral model. Comparing the reconstruction to the IHC receptor potential, we quantify the information transmission of the bat hearing system and investigate how this depends on the intensity of the incoming signal, the distribution of auditory neurons, and previous masking stimulation (adaptation). In addition, we show how this approach allows to inspect which spectral features survive neural encoding and hence can be relevant for echolocation.",M2
20162414,"Immunoglobulin heavy chain diversity in Pteropid <e>bats</e>: evidence for a diverse and highly specific antigen binding repertoire.Bats are the natural host reservoir for range of emerging and re-emerging viruses, many of which cause significant morbidity and mortality in other mammals, yet appear to result in no clinical consequences for bats. The ability of bats to coexist with a variety of viruses presents an interesting immunological problem that has not been examined in any detail but which could provide significant insights into the evolution of antiviral mechanisms in mammals. Towards a better understanding of the bat immune system, we analysed the expressed heavy chain variable (VH) regions of antibodies from the black flying fox, Pteropus alecto. The germline repertoire of the closely related Pteropid bat, Pteropus vampyrus, whose genome has been sequenced was also examined for comparative purposes. Representative VH genes were found in all three mammalian VH clans (I, II and III) in both the expressed P. alecto VH repertoire and the germline P. vampyrus VH repertoire. Evidence for the use of multiple heavy chain diversity (DH) and joining (JH) segments for the generation of diverse VDJ rearrangements was also present in the expressed antibody repertoire of P. alecto. The long period of co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses may have resulted in a variety of highly specific VH segments being hardwired into the genomes of bats and may have implications for their ability to successfully cope with a diversity of viral antigens.",M2
20157224,"Hair receptor sensitivity to changes in laminar boundary layer shape.Biologists have shown that <e>bat</e> wings contain distributed arrays of flow-sensitive hair receptors. The hair receptors are hypothesized to feedback information on airflows over the bat wing for enhanced stability or maneuverability during flight. Here, we study the geometric specialization of hair-like structures for the detection of changes in boundary layer velocity profiles (shapes). A quasi-steady model that relates the flow velocity profile incident on the longitudinal axis of a hair to the resultant moment and shear force at the hair base is developed. The hair length relative to the boundary layer momentum thickness that maximizes the resultant moment and shear-force sensitivity to changes in boundary layer shape is determined. The sensitivity of the resultant moment and shear force is shown to be highly dependent on hair length. Hairs that linearly taper to a point are shown to provide greater output sensitivity than hairs of uniform cross-section. On an order of magnitude basis, the computed optimal hair lengths are in agreement with the range of hair receptor lengths measured on individual bat species. These results support the hypothesis that bats use hair receptors for detecting changes in boundary layer shape and provide geometric guidelines for artificial hair sensor design and application.",M2

A new lyssavirus, named Shimoni bat virus (SHIBV), was isolated from the brain of a dead Commerson's leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros commersoni), found in a cave in the coastal region of Kenya. Genetic distances and phylogenetic reconstructions, implemented for each gene and for the concatenated alignment of all five structural genes (N, P, M, G and L), demonstrated that SHIBV cannot be identified with any of the existing species, but rather should be considered an independent species within phylogroup II of the Lyssavirus genus, most similar to Lagos bat virus (LBV). Antigenic reaction patterns with anti-nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies corroborated these distinctions. In addition, new data on the diversity of LBV suggests that this species may be subdivided quantitatively into three separate genotypes. However, the identity values alone are not considered sufficient criteria for demarcation of new species within LBV.",M2

Furthermore, we find evidence that these changes were driven by natural selection.",M2
20128344,"[Human rabies encephalitis by a vampire <e>bat</e> bite in an urban area of Colombia]Human rabies encephalitis by a vampire bat bite in an urban area of Colombia A case of rabies encephalitis is presented in a teenaged male, which developed four months after a bat bite in the urban area of Floridablanca, Santander Province, Colombia. The complex clinical manifestations prevented the confirmation of an antemortem diagnosis, principally because of the lengthy incubation period and the absence of other similar urban cases. Despite application of several therapies, including the Milwaukee protocol, the patient died 19 days after hospital admission. The autopsy revealed a necrotic, acute, pan-encephalitis of rabies virus etiology. The test of direct immunofluorescence in brain tissue was positive, as well as the biologic test in mice. Serological tests indicated it to be an antigenic variant type 3, whose main reservoir is the hematophagous vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus. This is probably the first case of bat-induced rabies reported in an urban community of Colombia and one of the few in Latin America. Although rabies encephalitis by a bat bite is rare, the case serves as a notice to health authorities and to the medical community to be alert to this risk.",M2
20118305,"Echolocation call production during aerial and terrestrial locomotion by New Zealand's enigmatic lesser short-tailed <e>bat</e>, Mystacina tuberculata.Linkage of echolocation call production with contraction of flight muscles has been suggested to reduce the energetic cost of flight with echolocation, such that the overall cost is approximately equal to that of flight alone. However, the pattern of call production with limb movement in terrestrially agile bats has never been investigated. We used synchronised high-speed video and audio recordings to determine patterns of association between echolocation call production and limb motion by Mystacina tuberculata Gray 1843 as individuals walked and flew, respectively. Results showed that there was no apparent linkage between call production and limb motion when bats walked. When in flight, two calls were produced per wingbeat, late in the downstroke and early in the upstroke. When bats walked, calls were produced at a higher rate, but at a slightly lower intensity, compared with bats in flight. These results suggest that M. tuberculata do not attempt to reduce the cost of terrestrial locomotion and call production through biomechanical linkage. They also suggest that the pattern of linkage seen when bats are in flight is not universal and that energetic savings cannot necessarily be explained by contraction of muscles associated with the downstroke alone.",M2

20098620,"Parallel and convergent evolution of the dim-light vision gene RH1 in <e>bats</e> (Order: Chiroptera).Rhodopsin, encoded by the gene Rhodopsin (RH1), is extremely sensitive to light, and is responsible for dim-light vision. Bats are nocturnal mammals that inhabit poor light environments. Megabats (Old-World fruit bats) generally have well-developed eyes, while microbats (insectivorous bats) have developed echolocation and in general their eyes were degraded, however, dramatic differences in the eyes, and their reliance on vision, exist in this group. In this study, we examined the rod opsin gene (RH1), and compared its evolution to that of two cone opsin genes (SWS1 and M/LWS). While phylogenetic reconstruction with the cone opsin genes SWS1 and M/LWS generated a species tree in accord with expectations, the RH1 gene tree united Pteropodidae (Old-World fruit bats) and Yangochiroptera, with very high bootstrap values, suggesting the possibility of convergent evolution. The hypothesis of convergent evolution was further supported when nonsynonymous sites or amino acid sequences were used to construct phylogenies. Reconstructed RH1 sequences at internal nodes of the bat species phylogeny showed that: (1) Old-World fruit bats share an amino acid change (S270G) with the tomb bat; (2) Miniopterus share two amino acid changes (V104I, M183L) with Rhinolophoidea; (3) the amino acid replacement I123V occurred independently on four branches, and the replacements L99M, L266V and I286V occurred each on two branches. The multiple parallel amino acid replacements that occurred in the evolution of bat RH1 suggest the possibility of multiple convergences of their ecological specialization (i.e., various photic environments) during adaptation for the nocturnal lifestyle, and suggest that further attention is needed on the study of the ecology and behavior of bats.",M2
20098413,"A bony connection signals laryngeal echolocation in <e>bats</e>.Echolocation is an active form of orientation in which animals emit sounds and then listen to reflected echoes of those sounds to form images of their surroundings in their brains. Although echolocation is usually associated with bats, it is not characteristic of all bats. Most echolocating bats produce signals in the larynx, but within one family of mainly non-echolocating species (Pteropodidae), a few species use echolocation sounds produced by tongue clicks. Here we demonstrate, using data obtained from micro-computed tomography scans of 26 species (n = 35 fluid-preserved bats), that proximal articulation of the stylohyal bone (part of the mammalian hyoid apparatus) with the tympanic bone always distinguishes laryngeally echolocating bats from all other bats (that is, non-echolocating pteropodids and those that echolocate with tongue clicks). In laryngeally echolocating bats, the proximal end of the stylohyal bone directly articulates with the tympanic bone and is often fused with it. Previous research on the morphology of the stylohyal bone in the oldest known fossil bat (Onychonycteris finneyi) suggested that it did not echolocate, but our findings suggest that O. finneyi may have used laryngeal echolocation because its stylohyal bones may have articulated with its tympanic bones. The present findings reopen basic questions about the timing and the origin of flight and echolocation in the early evolution of bats. Our data also provide an independent anatomical character by which to distinguish laryngeally echolocating bats from other bats.",M2

RESULTS: We studied three species of bats (Miniopterus schreibersii fuliginosus, Hipposideros armiger and H. pratti), representing the two suborders Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera. Using an established embryonic staging system, we identified the embryonic stages for M. schreibersii fuliginosus, H. armiger and H. pratti and described the morphological changes in each species, including the development of the complex and distinctive nose-leaves in H. armiger and H. pratti. Finally, we compared embryonic and fetal morphology of the three species in the present study with five other species for which information is available. CONCLUSION: As a whole, the organogenetic sequence of bat embryos is uniform and the embryos appear homoplastic before Stage 16. Morphological differentiation between species occurs mainly after embryonic Stage 16. Our study provides three new bat species for interspecific comparison of post-implantation embryonic development within the order Chiroptera and detailed data on the development of nose-leaves for bats in the superfamily Rhinolophoidea.",M2

20089640,"Host range, prevalence, and genetic diversity of adenoviruses in <e>bats</e>.Bats are the second largest group of mammals on earth and act as reservoirs of many emerging viruses. In this study, a novel bat adenovirus (AdV) (BtAdV-TJM) was isolated from bat fecal samples by using a bat primary kidney cell line. Infection studies indicated that most animal and human cell lines are susceptible to BtAdV-TJM, suggesting a possible wide host range. Genome analysis revealed 30 putative genes encoding proteins homologous to their counterparts in most known AdVs. Phylogenetic analysis placed BtAdV-TJM within the genus Mastadenovirus, most closely related to tree shrew and canine AdVs. PCR analysis of 350 bat fecal samples, collected from 19 species in five Chinese provinces during 2007 and 2008, indicated that 28 (or 8%) samples were positive for AdVs. The samples were from five bat species, Hipposideros armiger, Myotis horsfieldii, M. ricketti, Myotis spp., and Scotophilus kuhlii. The prevalence ranged from 6.25% (H. armiger in 2007) to 40% (M. ricketti in 2007). Comparison studies based on available partial sequences of the pol gene demonstrated a great genetic diversity among bat AdVs infecting different bat species as well as those infecting the same bat species. This is the first report of a genetically diverse group of DNA viruses in bats. Our results support the notion, derived from previous studies based on RNA viruses (especially coronaviruses and astroviruses), that bats seem to have the unusual ability to harbor a large number of genetically diverse viruses within a geographic location and/or within a taxonomic group.",M2
20086123,"Seasonality of torpor patterns and physiological variables of a free-ranging subtropical <e>bat</e>.Seasonal changes in weather and food availability differ vastly between temperate and subtropical climates, yet knowledge on how free-ranging subtropical insectivorous bats cope with such changes is limited. We quantified ambient temperatures, torpor patterns and thermal physiology of subtropical insectivorous northern long-eared bats, Nyctophilus bifax, during summer (n=13) and winter (n=8) by temperature telemetry. As predicted, ambient conditions varied significantly between seasons, with warmer weather during summer. All bats used torpor on 85% of observation days during summer in comparison to 100% during winter. During summer, patterns of torpor varied and the duration of torpor bouts was not significantly affected by ambient temperature, whereas during winter torpor bout duration was negatively correlated with mean ambient temperature. Mean torpor bout duration in summer was 3.2+/-1.3 h and in winter was 26.8+/-11.3 h. Mean arousal time during summer was in the early afternoon and during winter in the late afternoon, and throughout both seasons arousals for possible foraging periods occurred near sunset. Skin temperature was positively correlated with ambient temperatures in both seasons, but the relationship differed between seasons. We show that torpor is used regularly throughout the year in a free-ranging subtropical bat and provide the first evidence demonstrating that torpor patterns and thermal physiology change with season.",M2
20074213,"Dynamic stimulation evokes spatially focused receptive fields in <e>bat</e> auditory cortex.Bats can orient and hunt for prey in complete darkness using echolocation. Due to the pulse-like character of call emission they receive a stroboscopic view of their environment. During target approach, bats adjust their emitted echolocation calls to the specific requirements of the dynamically changing environmental and behavioral context. In addition to changes of the spectro-temporal call features, the spatial focusing of the beam of the sonar emissions onto the target is a conspicuous feature during target tracking. The neural processes underlying the complex sensory-motor interactions during target tracking are not well understood. In this study, we used a two-tone-pulse paradigm with 81 combinations of inter-aural intensity differences and six inter-pulse intervals in a passive hearing task to tackle the question of how transient changes in the azimuthal position of successive sounds are encoded by neurons in the auditory cortex of the bat Phyllostomus discolor. In a population of cortical neurons (11%, 24 of 217), spatial receptive fields were focused to a small region of frontal azimuthal positions during dynamic stimulation with tone-pulse pairs at short inter-pulse intervals. The response of these neurons might be important for the behaviorally observed locking of the sonar beam onto a selected target during the later stages of target tracking. Most interestingly, the majority of these neurons (88%, 21 of 24) were located in the posterior dorsal part of the auditory cortex. This cortical subfield might thus be specifically involved in the analysis of dynamic acoustic scenes.",M2
20071579,"Ecoepidemiology and complete genome comparison of different strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related Rhinolophus <e>bat</e> coronavirus in China reveal bats as a reservoir for acute, self-limiting infection that allows recombination events.Despite the identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) in Rhinolophus Chinese horseshoe bats (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV) in China, the evolutionary and possible recombination origin of SARSr-CoV remains undetermined. We carried out the first study to investigate the migration pattern and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV genome epidemiology in Chinese horseshoe bats during a 4-year period. Of 1,401 Chinese horseshoe bats from Hong Kong and Guangdong, China, that were sampled, SARSr-Rh-BatCoV was detected in alimentary specimens from 130 (9.3%) bats, with peak activity during spring. A tagging exercise of 511 bats showed migration distances from 1.86 to 17 km. Bats carrying SARSr-Rh-BatCoV appeared healthy, with viral clearance occurring between 2 weeks and 4 months. However, lower body weights were observed in bats positive for SARSr-Rh-BatCoV, but not Rh-BatCoV HKU2. Complete genome sequencing of 10 SARSr-Rh-BatCoV strains showed frequent recombination between different strains. Moreover, recombination was detected between SARSr-Rh-BatCoV Rp3 from Guangxi, China, and Rf1 from Hubei, China, in the possible generation of civet SARSr-CoV SZ3, with a breakpoint at the nsp16/spike region. Molecular clock analysis showed that SARSr-CoVs were newly emerged viruses with the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) at 1972, which diverged between civet and bat strains in 1995. The present data suggest that SARSr-Rh-BatCoV causes acute, self-limiting infection in horseshoe bats, which serve as a reservoir for recombination between strains from different geographical locations within reachable foraging range. Civet SARSr-CoV is likely a recombinant virus arising from SARSr-CoV strains closely related to SARSr-Rh-BatCoV Rp3 and Rf1. Such frequent recombination, coupled with rapid evolution especially in ORF7b/ORF8 region, in these animals may have accounted for the cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS.",M2

We found that Rousettus aegyptiacus STAT1 (bat STAT1) is phosphorylatable and translocates to the nucleus when stimulated with human IFN-alpha (hIFN-alpha). Furthermore, phosphorylation of bat STAT1 and inhibition of nuclear translocation was observed in IFN-stimulated cells infected with the HEP-Flury strain of rabies virus, in the same manner as in other mammals.

20063102,"Distress call-induced gene expression in the brain of the Indian short-nosed fruit <e>bat</e>, Cynopterus sphinx.Individuals in distress emit audible vocalizations to either warn or inform conspecifics. The Indian short-nosed fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx, emits distress calls soon after becoming entangled in mist nets, which appear to attract conspecifics. Phase I of these distress calls is longer and louder, and includes a secondary peak, compared to phase II. Activity-dependent expression of egr-1 was examined in free-ranging C. sphinx following the emissions and responses to a distress call. We found that the level of expression of egr-1 was higher in bats that emitted a distress call, in adults that responded, and in pups than in silent bats. Up-regulated cDNA was amplified to identify the target gene (TOE1) of the protein Egr-1. The observed expression pattern Toe1 was similar to that of egr-1. These findings suggest that the neuronal activity related to recognition of a distress call and an auditory feedback mechanism induces the expression of Egr-1. Co-expression of egr-1 with Toe1 may play a role in initial triggering of the genetic mechanism that could be involved in the consolidation or stabilization of distress call memories.",M2
20050004,"Two new species of Eimeria (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) from eastern red <e>bats</e>, Lasiurus borealis (Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae), in Arkansas and North Carolina.During August 2003 and August 2004, 11 adult eastern red bats, Lasiurus borealis, were collected and their feces examined for coccidian parasites. Bats were obtained in August 2003 from Garland, Montgomery, and Yell counties, Arkansas (n=6) and in August 2004 from Anson and Montgomery counties, North Carolina (n=5). Seven (63.6%) of the bats were passing oocysts of 2 undescribed species of Eimeria. Oocysts of Eimeria dowleri n. sp. were subspherical to ellipsoidal, 24.7 x 22.0 (23-26 x 20-23) microm, with a bilayered wall, externally moderately pitted, internally smooth, and with a shape index of 1.1. Micropyle and oocyst residuum were absent, but a polar granule was present. Sporocysts were ovoidal, 13.4 x 9.2 (12-14 x 8-9) pm; shape index was 1.5; Stieda and sub-Stieda bodies were present. A sporocyst residuum consisting of homogeneous granules was scattered among the sporozoites; sporozoites were elongate, with a subspherical anterior refractile body and an elongate posterior refractile body; a nucleus was not discernable. Oocysts of Eimeria sealanderi n. sp. were subspherical to ellipsoidal, 16.7 x 14.4 (15-18 x 13-16) microm, with a bilayered wall, externally lightly pitted, internally smooth, and with a shape index of 1.2. A micropyle was absent, but the oocyst residuum and polar granule were present. Oocyst residuum consisted of a single, membrane-bound homogenous granule. Sporocysts were ovoidal, 8.9 x 5.7 (8-10 x 5-6) microm, with a shape index of 1.6; Stieda and sub-Stieda bodies were present. The sporocyst residuum consisted of 10, to several dozen, homogeneous granules of various sizes loosely clustered among the sporozoites, which were elongate and without obvious refractile bodies and nucleus. This is the first time any coccidian has been reported from this host and the first instance of a bat coccidian reported from North Carolina.",M2
20046044,"Molecular cloning and sequencing of the cDNAs encoding the <e>bat</e> interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.This is the first report on the cDNA sequences of bat interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. The cDNAs of bat IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, and TNF-alpha comprise 459, 405, 624, 537, 990, and 699 base pairs respectively. Moreover, each of the cDNAs of bat IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, and TNF-alpha contain a single open reading frames encoding 152, 134, 207, 178, 329, and 232 amino acids, respectively. The comparison of bat cytokines with Perrissodactyla (horse), Carnivora (dog and cat), and Cetartiodactyla (cattle and pig) orthologs revealed a high degree of homology. Although the N-terminal amino acids and cysteine residues are highly conserved in each mature cytokine, the deduced N-linked glycosylation sites vary across species.",M2
20043956,"Characterization of the sleep architecture in two species of fruit <e>bat</e>.Bats (Chiroptera) are the second-most abundant mammalian order in the world, occupying a diverse range of habitats and exhibiting many different life history traits. In order to contribute to this highly underrepresented group we describe the sleep architecture of two species of frugivorous bat, the greater short-nosed fruit bat (Cynopterus sphinx) and the lesser dawn fruit bat (Eonycteris spelaea). Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) data were recorded from multiple individuals (&gt;or=5) by telemetry over a 72-h period in a laboratory setting with light/dark cycles equivalent to those found in the wild. Our results show that over a 24-h period both species spent more time asleep than awake (mean 15 h), less than previous reported for Chiroptera (20 h). C. sphinx spent significantly more of its non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) quotas during the light phase, while E. spelaea divided its sleep-wake architecture equally between both light and dark phases. Comparing the sleep patterns of the two species found that C. sphinx had significantly fewer NREM and REM episodes than E. spelaea but each episode lasted for a significantly longer period of time. Potential hypotheses to explain the differences in the sleep architecture of C. sphinx with E. spelaea, including risk of predation and social interaction are discussed.",M2

The aim of the study was to analyze the factors associated with bat attacks and the development of human rabies. Of the 46 individuals, who suffered bat attacks, 36 (78.3%) were under 17 years of age. The risk factors associated with bat attacks were age under 17 years, having observed bats inside the bedroom and having been without electrical power in the house. Age under 17 years and having been without electrical power in the house were factors associated with human rabies.",M2
20026417,"Melatonin modulates glucose homeostasis during winter dormancy in a vespertilionid <e>bat</e>, Scotophilus heathi.The role for melatonin in glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance is not very clear and has recently been an active area of investigation. The present study investigated the role of melatonin in seasonal accumulation of adipose tissue in Scotophilus heathi, with particular reference to its role in glucose homeostasis and development of insulin resistance. The circulating melatonin levels correlated positively (p&lt;0.05) with the changes in body mass due to fat accumulation and circulating insulin level, but correlated negatively with the blood glucose level in S. heathi. The bats showed high circulating blood glucose levels and impaired glucose tolerance during the period of fat deposition suggesting insulin resistance condition which improves after winter when most of the fat has been utilized as a metabolic fuel. The high circulating melatonin levels during the period of maximum body fat at the beginning of winter prepare the bats for winter dormancy by modulating the glucose homeostasis through affecting blood glucose levels, muscle and liver glycogen stores, insulin receptor and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4) expression. This is also confirmed by in vivo study in which melatonin injection improves the glucose tolerance, increases muscle insulin receptor and GLUT 4 expression, and enhances glucose clearance from the blood. The results of present study further showed that the effect of melatonin injection on the blood glucose levels is determined by the metabolic state of the bats and may protect from decrease in blood glucose level during extreme starvation, however, melatonin when injected during fed state increases glucose clearance from the blood. In summary, the present study suggested that melatonin interferes with the glucose homeostasis through modulating intracellular glucose transport and may protect bats from hypoglycemia during winter dormancy.",M2
20021693,"Phylogeography of the common vampire <e>bat</e> (Desmodus rotundus): marked population structure, Neotropical Pleistocene vicariance and incongruence between nuclear and mtDNA markers.BACKGROUND: The common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus is an excellent model organism for studying ecological vicariance in the Neotropics due to its broad geographic range and its preference for forested areas as roosting sites. With the objective of testing for Pleistocene ecological vicariance, we sequenced a mitocondrial DNA (mtDNA) marker and two nuclear markers (RAG2 and DRB) to try to understand how Pleistocene glaciations affected the distribution of intraspecific lineages in this bat. RESULTS: Five reciprocally monophyletic clades were evident in the mitochondrial gene tree, and in most cases with high bootstrap support: Central America (CA), Amazon and Cerrado (AMC), Pantanal (PAN), Northern Atlantic Forest (NAF) and Southern Atlantic Forest (SAF). The Atlantic forest clades formed a monophyletic clade with high bootstrap support, creating an east/west division for this species in South America. On the one hand, all coalescent and non-coalescent estimates point to a Pleistocene time of divergence between the clades. On the other hand, the nuclear markers showed extensive sharing of haplotypes between distant localities, a result compatible with male-biased gene flow. In order to test if the disparity between the mitochondrial and nuclear markers was due to the difference in mutation rate and effective size, we performed a coalescent simulation to examine the feasibility that, given the time of separation between the observed lineages, even with a gene flow rate close to zero, there would not be reciprocal monophyly for a neutral nuclear marker. We used the observed values of theta and an estimated mutation rate for the nuclear marker gene to perform 1000 iterations of the simulation. The results of this simulation were inconclusive: the number of iterations with and without reciprocal monophyly of one or more clades are similar. CONCLUSIONS: We therefore conclude that the pattern exhibited by the common vampire bat, with marked geographical structure for a mitochondrial marker and no phylogeographic structure for nuclear markers is compatible with a historical scenario of complete isolation of refuge-like populations during the Pleistocene. The results on demographic history on this species is compatible with the Carnaval-Moritz model of Pleistocene vicariance, with demographic expansions in the southern Atlantic forest.",M2
20019654,"Imported case of Marburg hemorrhagic fever - Colorado, 2008.Marburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF) is a rare, viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF); the causative agent is an RNA virus in the family Filoviridae, and growing evidence demonstrates that fruit <e>bats</e> are the natural reservoir of Marburg virus (MARV). On January 9, 2008, an infectious disease physician notified the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) of a case of unexplained febrile illness requiring hospitalization in a woman who had returned from travel in Uganda. Testing of early convalescent serum demonstrated no evidence of infection with agents that cause tropical febrile illnesses, including VHF. Six months later, in July 2008, the patient requested repeat testing after she learned of the death from MHF of a Dutch tourist who had visited the same bat-roosting cave as the patient, the Python Cave in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda. The convalescent serologic testing revealed evidence of prior infection with MARV, and MARV RNA was detected in the archived early convalescent serum. A public health investigation did not identify illness consistent with secondary MHF transmission among her contacts, and no serologic evidence of infection was detected among the six tested of her eight tour companions. The patient might have acquired MARV infection through exposure to bat secretions or excretions while visiting the Python Cave. Travelers should be aware of the risk for acquiring MHF in caves or mines inhabited by bats in endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa. Health-care providers should consider VHF among travelers returning from endemic areas who experience unexplained febrile illness.",M2
20018256,"Low genetic diversities of rabies virus populations within different hosts in Brazil.The low rates of nonsynonymous evolution observed in natural rabies virus (RABV) isolates are suggested to have arisen in association with the structural and functional constraints operating on the virus protein and the infection strategies employed by RABV within infected hosts to avoid strong selection by the immune response. In order to investigate the relationship between the genetic characteristics of RABV populations within hosts and the virus evolution, the present study examined the genetic heterogeneities of RABV populations within naturally infected dogs and foxes in Brazil, as well as those of <e>bat</e> RABV populations that were passaged once in suckling mice. Sequence analyses of complete RABV glycoprotein (G) genes showed that RABV populations within infected hosts were genetically highly homogeneous whether they were infected naturally or experimentally (nucleotide diversities of 0-0.95x10(-3)). In addition, amino acid mutations were randomly distributed over the entire region of the G protein, and the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios (d(N)/d(S)) for the G protein gene were less than 1. These findings suggest that the low genetic diversities of RABV populations within hosts reflect the stabilizing selection operating on the virus, the infection strategies of the virus, and eventually, the evolutionary patterns of the virus.",M2
20016037,"Intraspecies diversity of SARS-like coronaviruses in Rhinolophus sinicus and its implications for the origin of SARS coronaviruses in humans.The Chinese rufous horseshoe <e>bat</e> (Rhinolophus sinicus) has been suggested to carry the direct ancestor of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV), and the diversity of SARS-like CoVs (SLCoV) within this Rhinolophus species is therefore worth investigating. Here, we demonstrate the remarkable diversity of SLCoVs in R. sinicus and identify a strain with the same pattern of phylogenetic incongruence (i.e. an indication of recombination) as reported previously in another SLCoV strain. Moreover, this strain possesses a distinctive 579 nt deletion in the nsp3 region that was also found in a human SCoV from the late-phase epidemic. Phylogenetic analysis of the Orf1 region suggested that the human SCoVs are phylogenetically closer to SLCoVs in R. sinicus than to SLCoVs in other Rhinolophus species. These findings reveal a closer evolutionary linkage between SCoV in humans and SLCoVs in R. sinicus, defining the scope of surveillance to search for the direct ancestor of human SCoVs.",M2
20011515,"Establishment, immortalisation and characterisation of pteropid <e>bat</e> cell lines.BACKGROUND: Bats are the suspected natural reservoir hosts for a number of new and emerging zoonotic viruses including Nipah virus, Hendra virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus. Since the discovery of SARS-like coronaviruses in Chinese horseshoe bats, attempts to isolate a SL-CoV from bats have failed and attempts to isolate other bat-borne viruses in various mammalian cell lines have been similarly unsuccessful. New stable bat cell lines are needed to help with these investigations and as tools to assist in the study of bat immunology and virus-host interactions. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) were captured from the wild and transported live to the laboratory for primary cell culture preparation using a variety of different methods and culture media. Primary cells were successfully cultured from 20 different organs. Cell immortalisation can occur spontaneously, however we used a retroviral system to immortalise cells via the transfer and stable production of the Simian virus 40 Large T antigen and the human telomerase reverse transcriptase protein. Initial infection experiments with both cloned and uncloned cell lines using Hendra and Nipah viruses demonstrated varying degrees of infection efficiency between the different cell lines, although it was possible to infect cells in all tissue types. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The approaches developed and optimised in this study should be applicable to bats of other species. We are in the process of generating further cell lines from a number of different bat species using the methodology established in this study.",M2
20004487,"Landscape risk factors for attacks of vampire <e>bats</e> on cattle in Sao Paulo, Brazil.Vampire-bat (Desmodus rotundus) attacks on cattle are a major concern for cattle-raising area. Blood loss and paralytic rabies due to bat bites can impose severe losses on the livestock. We took four municipalities inside the Sao Joao da Boa Vista veterinary district (Sao Paulo, Brazil) as a study area and tested a set of landscape features for spatial correlation with distance to areas in which vampire-bat attacks on cattle were documented. Bat- and cattle-related data from the Sao Paulo State Rabies Control Program were used. Landscape data (first-order rivers and their tributaries, main roads, railways and urban areas) were obtained from official cartographic agencies; forest, sugarcane and pasture data were acquired from remote-sensing mappings. The study area was taken as a grid split into 178 cells. Each 4kmx4km cell was filled with bat, cattle and landscape data. Our analysis detected that grid cells that were closer to areas of bat attacks on cattle had higher cattle density and a greater percentage of the land committed to sugarcane cropping, and were close to forest fragments. These results shed light on the need for rethink the Rabies Control Program strategies for defining the surveillance of vampire-bat populations and rabies control in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.",M2
20000945,"Pinna-rim skin folds narrow the sonar beam in the lesser false vampire <e>bat</e> (Megaderma spasma).False vampire bats (genus Megaderma) employ active as well as passive biosonars. In the present work, the acoustic impact of a conspicuous feature of the animals' ear morphology, skin folds of the pinna rim linking the two pinnae at the midline, has been studied using a numerical approach. Automated methods have been devised to measure the largest width of the beam patterns irrespective of beam orientation. A total of six pinna shapes from three individuals have been studied. For all these shapes, it was found that the reception biosonar beams had approximately elliptic cross-sections with the largest beamwidth being on average almost twice as large as the beamwidth in the orthogonal direction. The directions of the largest beamwidths were scattered around the azimuthal dimension. Removal of the skin folds resulted in significant widening of the beams along their widest dimensions with an increase in beamwidth of 9.2 degrees (a 30% change) on average. The strength and repeatability of this effect across individuals suggest the hypothesis that skin folds are functionally relevant to the animals' biosonar system. It may be a morphological adaptation to biosonar tasks that benefit from a narrow beam such as the detection of faint sounds or precise localization.",M2
19999377,"<e>Bat</e> rabies--a Gordian knot?Although classical rabies is one of the earliest identified and best studied infectious diseases, there is still limited knowledge about lyssaviruses and their major natural hosts, bats. Focussing on bat rabies in Europe caused by European bat lyssaviruses 1 (EBLV-1) and 2, for instance the association of EBLV-1 to Eptesicus bats and EBLV-2 to Myotis daubentonii and M. dasycneme together with an apparent clustering of cases is one question still to be answered. Furthermore, the question whether EBLVs are less virulent or bats less susceptible is the key to the understanding of the disease. Accumulating evidence from experimental studies and field observations, however, has resulted in contradicting hypotheses. Serological surveys, using tools developed for classical rabies, are often used for bat rabies surveillance. However, such surveys are hampered by the lack of validated methods applicable for bat sera. Bats seem to play a prominent role as reservoir for viral pathogens and the unique biology of bats especially the immune response may contribute to this. Considering all known aspects, bat rabies seems to form a yet unsolvable entanglement, reminiscent of the ancient tale of the Gordian knot. In this manuscript we will not be able to untangle this knot, but we hope to offer some suggestions of where to start.",M2
19967177,"<e>Bat</e> community species richness and composition in a restinga protected area in Southeastern Brazil.In Brazil, restingas are under severe human-induced impacts resulting in habitat degradation and loss and remain one of the less frequently studied ecosystems. The main objectives of the present study are to describe the bat community in a restinga in Paulo Cesar Vinha State Park, Guarapari municipality, state of Espírito Santo, southeastern Brazil. Fieldwork was conducted twice a month from August 2004 to September 2005. A total sampling effort of 40,300 m(2)/h, represents the largest sampling effort for sampling bats in restingas to date. Bats were sampled in five different vegetational types in the area. Captured bats were processed recording information on species, sex, age, forearm length and weight. Shannon Diversity and Jaccard indexes were used to analyse diversity and similarity among habitats in the Park. A total of 554 captures belonging to 14 species and two families were obtained. Noctilio leporinus was recorded through direct observation and an ultra-sound detector also registered the presence of individuals from the family Molossidae, without being possible to distinguish it at specific level. Frugivores were the most representative guild. Richness was higher in Clusia shrubs (11 species) and Caraís lagoon (10 species). Shannon diversity index was estimated at H' = 1.43 for the overall sample, with Caraís lagoon representing the most diverse habitat (H' = 1.60). The greater similarity (J = 0.714) was observed for the two areas under high human influence.",M2

19955305,"Intergenotypic replacement of lyssavirus matrix proteins demonstrates the role of lyssavirus M proteins in intracellular virus accumulation.Lyssavirus assembly depends on the matrix protein (M). We compared lyssavirus M proteins from different genotypes for their ability to support assembly and egress of genotype 1 rabies virus (RABV). Transcomplementation of M-deficient RABV with M from European <e>bat</e> lyssavirus (EBLV) types 1 and 2 reduced the release of infectious virus. Stable introduction of the heterogenotypic M proteins into RABV led to chimeric viruses with reduced virus release and intracellular accumulation of virus genomes. Although the chimeras indicated genotype-specific evolution of M, rapid selection of a compensatory mutant suggested conserved mechanisms of lyssavirus assembly and the requirement for only few adaptive mutations to fit the heterogenotypic M to a RABV backbone. Whereas the compensatory mutant replicated to similar infectious titers as RABV M-expressing virus, ultrastructural analysis revealed that both nonadapted EBLV M chimeras and the compensatory mutant differed from RABV M expressing viruses in the lack of intracellular viruslike structures that are enveloped and accumulate in cisterna of the degranulated and dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum compartment. Moreover, all viruses were able to bud at the plasma membrane. Since the lack of the intracellular viruslike structures correlated with the type of M protein but not with the efficiency of virus release, we hypothesize that the M proteins of EBLV-1 and RABV differ in their target membranes for virus assembly. Although the biological function of intracellular assembly and accumulation of viruslike structures in the endoplasmic reticulum remain unclear, the observed differences could contribute to diverse host tropism or pathogenicity.",M2

19937217,"Diverse archaeal community of a <e>bat</e> guano pile in Domica Cave (Slovak Karst, Slovakia).The molecular diversity of Archaea in a bat guano pile in Cave Domica (Slovakia), temperate cave ecosystem with significant bat colony (about 1600 individuals), was examined. The guano pile was created mainly by an activity of the Mediterranean horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus euryale) and provides a source of organic carbon and other nutrients in the oligotrophic subsurface ecosystem. The upper and the basal parts of guano surface were sampled where the latter one had higher pH and higher admixture of limestone bedrock and increased colonization of invertebrates. The relative proportion of Archaea determined using CARD-FISH in both parts was 3.5-3.9 % (the basal and upper part, respectively). The archaeal community was dominated by non-thermophilic Crenarchaeota (99 % of clones). Phylogenetic analysis of 115 16S rDNA sequences revealed the presence of Crenarchaeota previously isolated from temperate surface soils (group 1.1b, 62 clones), deep subsurface acid waters (group 1.1a, 52 clones) and Euryarchaeota (1 clone). Four of the analyzed sequences were found to have little similarity to those in public databases. The composition of both archaeal communities differed, with respect to higher diversity of Archaea in the upper part of the bat guano pile. High diversity archaeal population is present in the bat guano deposit and consists of both soil- and subsurface-born Crenarchaeota.",M2

19906883,"Chronotopically organized target-distance map in the auditory cortex of the short-tailed fruit <e>bat</e>.Topographic cortical representation of echo delay, the cue for target range, is an organizational feature implemented in the auditory cortices of certain bats dedicated to catch flying insects. Such cortical echo-delay maps provide a calibrated neural representation of object spatial distance. To assess general requirements for echo-delay computations, cortical delay sensitivity was examined in the short-tailed fruit bat Carollia perspicillata that uses frequency-modulated (FM) echolocation signals. Delay-tuned neurons with temporal specificity comparable to those of insectivorous bats are located within the high-frequency (HF) field of the auditory cortex. All recorded neurons in the HF field respond well to single pure-tone and FM-FM stimulus pairs. The neurons respond to identical FM harmonic components in echolocation pulse and delayed echo (e.g., FM(2)-FM(2)). Their characteristic delays (CDs) for low echo amplitudes range between 1 and 24 ms, which is comparable to other bat species. Maps of the topography of FM-FM neurons show that they are distributed across the entire HF area and organized along a rostrocaudal echo-delay axis representing object distance. Rostrally located neurons tuned to delays of 2-8 ms are overrepresented (66% of CDs). Neurons with longer delays (&gt;/=10 ms) are located throughout the caudal half of the HF field. The delay-sensitive chronotopic area covers approximately 3.3 mm in rostrocaudal and approximately 3.7 mm in dorsoventral direction, which is comparable or slightly larger than the size of cortical delay-tuned areas in insectivorous constant frequency bats, the only other bat species for which cortical chronotopy has been demonstrated. This indicates that chronotopic cortical organization is not only used exclusively for precise insect localization in constant frequency bats but could also be of advantage for general orientation tasks.",M2

Chemical recognition of roostmates within these assemblages has not been extensively studied despite the fact that an ability to chemically recognize individuals could play an important role in forming and stabilizing complex suites of social interactions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Individual bats were given a choice between three roosting pouches: one permeated with the scent of a group of roostmates, one permeated with the scent of non-roostmates, and a clean control. Subjects rejected non-roostmate pouches with greater frequency than roostmate pouches or blank control pouches. Also, bats chose to roost in the roostmate scented pouches more often than the non-roostmate or control pouches. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrated that T. brasiliensis has the ability to chemically recognize roostmates from non-roostmates and a preference for roosting in areas occupied by roostmates. It is important to investigate these behaviors because of their potential importance in colony dynamics and roost choice.",M2

Blood was sampled for the detection of EBLV-specific neutralizing antibodies and oropharyngeal swabs were taken for the detection of viral RNA or infectious virus in saliva. Between 2003 and 2006, 273 E. serotinus and 363 M. daubentonii blood samples were tested by the EBLV-1 or EBLV-2 specific modified fluorescent antibody neutralization test. The EBLV-2 antibody prevalence estimate was 1.0-4.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]; mean=2.2%) for M. daubentonii. European bat lyssavirus type 1-specific antibodies were detected only in a single E. serotinus. Other nontarget species (n=5) were sampled in small numbers (n=24), with no EBLV-specific antibody detected. No viral RNA or live virus was detected in any of the oropharyngeal swabs analyzed. Host RNA was detected from 83% of the oropharyngeal swabs analyzed (total swabs 2003-06: n=766). These data show that EBLV-2 is present in M. daubentonii in England. In contrast, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that EBLV-1 is present in E. serotinus in England, although further research is warranted.",M2

The enzyme showed the highest proteinase activity at 60 degrees C at pH 10.0. The activity was strongly inhibited by PMSF and chymostatin. The proteinase activity was not affected by the presence of 2% urea, 2% H(2)O(2), 12% SDS, 15% triton X-100, or 15% tween 80. The proteinase preferred Met, Leu, Phe, and Tyr residues at the P(1) position, in descending order. The k(cat), K(m) and k(cat)/K(m) values for Z-Val-Lys-Met-MCA were 16.8+/-0.14 min(-1), 5.1+/-0.28 microM, and 3.3+/-0.28 microM(-1) min(-1) respectively. This is the first report of an alkaline serine-proteinase with extremely high stability against detergents such as SDS.",M2
19897034,"Melatonin affects steroidogenesis and delayed ovulation during winter in vespertilionid <e>bat</e>, Scotophilus heathi.The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of melatonin in ovarian activity of Scotophilus heathi particularly in reference to changes in steroidogenesis and steroid receptor expression during the anovulatory period of delayed ovulation. Female S. heathi showed an increased circulating melatonin level during the period of delayed ovulation in winter coinciding with the increased androstenedione (A(4)) levels, body fat and ovarian androgen receptor expression. The circulating melatonin level decreased to a low level after winter during the period of ovulation in March which also coincided with the decreased circulating A(4) levels and body fat. The circulating estrogen (E(2)) showed two peaks corresponding with the two waves of follicular development in November and February. Both the isoforms of progesterone receptor (PR), PR-A and PR-B, remained high throughout the follicular development, but expression of PR-A declined significantly during the ovulation. The treatment with melatonin, both in vitro and in vivo, significantly increased progesterone and A(4), but not the estradiol synthesis by the ovaries of S. heathi. The study further suggested that the increased androgens during winter may be primarily due to the stimulatory effect of melatonin on steroidogenic enzyme 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) activity. Therefore the increased circulating melatonin level in S. heathi during winter delay (inhibits) ovulation through increased androgen synthesis, but suppression of estradiol synthesis.",M2
19893481,"Human rabies - Missouri, 2008.On November 24, 2008, the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory notified CDC of suspected rabies in a man aged 55 years from Missouri. The man had been bitten by a <e>bat</e> 4--6 weeks before symptom onset and had not sought medical care at the time of the bite. After visiting two emergency departments (EDs) with symptoms consistent with rabies, he was hospitalized on November 23 and treated using the Milwaukee protocol. On November 26, infection with a rabies virus variant associated with silver-haired bats was confirmed. The patient died on November 30. This report summarizes the patient's treatment and clinical course. The report highlights the importance of raising public awareness of rabies, particularly the risk for rabies after bat and other wildlife exposures. Health-care providers should maintain a high clinical suspicion for rabies in patients with a recent animal bite history and unexplained encephalitis.",M2
19886791,"Transmission of human infection with Nipah virus.Nipah virus (NiV) is a paramyxovirus whose reservoir host is fruit <e>bats</e> of the genus Pteropus. Occasionally the virus is introduced into human populations and causes severe illness characterized by encephalitis or respiratory disease. The first outbreak of NiV was recognized in Malaysia, but 8 outbreaks have been reported from Bangladesh since 2001. The primary pathways of transmission from bats to people in Bangladesh are through contamination of raw date palm sap by bats with subsequent consumption by humans and through infection of domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and goats), presumably from consumption of food contaminated with bat saliva or urine with subsequent transmission to people. Approximately one-half of recognized Nipah case patients in Bangladesh developed their disease following person-to-person transmission of the virus. Efforts to prevent transmission should focus on decreasing bat access to date palm sap and reducing family members' and friends' exposure to infected patients' saliva.",M2
19880157,"Detection of endocrine disrupting chemicals in aerial invertebrates at sewage treatment works.Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) constitute a diverse group of chemical compounds which can alter endocrine function in exposed animals. Whilst most studies have focussed on exposure of wildlife to EDCs via aquatic routes, there is the potential for transfer into the terrestrial food chain through consumption of contaminated prey items developing in sewage sludge and waste water at sewage treatment works. In this study, we determine levels of EDCs in aerial insects whose larval stages develop on percolating filter beds at sewage treatment works. We compare absolute concentrations of known EDCs with those collected from aquatic environments not exposed to sewage effluent outflow. Our findings document for the first time that aerial invertebrates developing on sewage filter beds take up a range of chemicals thought to be incorporated from the sewage effluent, which act as endocrine disruptors. For two synthetic chemicals (17alpha-ethinylestradiol and butylated hydroxy aniline), concentrations were significantly higher in insects captured around percolating filter beds than sites over 2 km from the nearest sewage works. A number of species of insectivorous <e>bats</e> and birds, some of which are declining or threatened, use sewage works as principle foraging sites. We calculate approximate exposure levels for a species of bat known to forage within sewage works and suggest that further research is warranted to assess the ecological implications of consuming contaminated invertebrate prey.",M2
19862320,"Fellatio by fruit <e>bats</e> prolongs copulation time.Oral sex is widely used in human foreplay, but rarely documented in other animals. Fellatio has been recorded in bonobos Pan paniscus, but even then functions largely as play behaviour among juvenile males. The short-nosed fruit bat Cynopterus sphinx exhibits resource defence polygyny and one sexually active male often roosts with groups of females in tents made from leaves. Female bats often lick their mate's penis during dorsoventral copulation. The female lowers her head to lick the shaft or the base of the male's penis but does not lick the glans penis which has already penetrated the vagina. Males never withdrew their penis when it was licked by the mating partner. A positive relationship exists between the length of time that the female licked the male's penis during copulation and the duration of copulation. Furthermore, mating pairs spent significantly more time in copulation if the female licked her mate's penis than if fellatio was absent. Males also show postcopulatory genital grooming after intromission. At present, we do not know why genital licking occurs, and we present four non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that may explain the function of fellatio in C. sphinx.",M2

19847807,"Molecular mechanism underlying muscle mass retention in hibernating <e>bats</e>: role of periodic arousal.Hibernators like bats show only marginal muscle atrophy during prolonged hibernation. The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that hibernators use periodic arousal to increase protein anabolism that compensates for the continuous muscle proteolysis during disuse. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of 3-month hibernation (HB) and 7-day post-arousal torpor (TP) followed by re-arousal (RA) on signaling activities in the pectoral muscles of summer-active (SA) and dormant Murina leucogaster bats. The bats did not lose muscle mass relative to body mass during the HB or TP-to-RA period. For the first 30-min following arousal, the peak amplitude and frequency of electromyographic spikes increased 3.1- and 1.4-fold, respectively, indicating massive myofiber recruitment and elevated motor signaling during shivering. Immunoblot analyses of whole-tissue lysates revealed several principal outcomes: (1) for the 3-month HB, the phosphorylation levels of Akt1 (p-Akt1) and p-mTOR decreased significantly compared to SA bats, but p-FoxO1 levels remained unaltered; (2) for the TP-to-RA period, p-Akt1 and p-FoxO1 varied little, while p-mTOR showed biphasic oscillation; (3) proteolytic signals (i.e., atrogin-1, MuRF1, Skp2 and calpain-1) remained constant during the HB and TP-to-RA period. These results suggest that the resistive properties of torpid bat muscle against atrophy might be attained primarily by relatively constant proteolysis in combination with oscillatory anabolic activity (e.g., p-mTOR) corresponding to the frequency of arousals occurring throughout hibernation.",M2

19844569,"Evidence for repeated independent evolution of migration in the largest family of <e>bats</e>.BACKGROUND: How migration evolved represents one of the most poignant questions in evolutionary biology. While studies on the evolution of migration in birds are well represented in the literature, migration in bats has received relatively little attention. Yet, more than 30 species of bats are known to migrate annually from breeding to non-breeding locations. Our study is the first to test hypotheses on the evolutionary history of migration in bats using a phylogenetic framework. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In addition to providing a review of bat migration in relation to existing hypotheses on the evolution of migration in birds, we use a previously published supertree to formulate and test hypotheses on the evolutionary history of migration in bats. Our results suggest that migration in bats has evolved independently in several lineages potentially as the need arises to track resources (food, roosting site) but not through a series of steps from short- to long-distance migrants, as has been suggested for birds. Moreover, our analyses do not indicate that migration is an ancestral state but has relatively recently evolved in bats. Our results also show that migration is significantly less likely to evolve in cave roosting bats than in tree roosting species. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to provide evidence that migration has evolved independently in bat lineages that are not closely related. If migration evolved as a need to track seasonal resources or seek adequate roosting sites, climate change may have a pivotal impact on bat migratory habits. Our study provides a strong framework for future research on the evolution of migration in chiropterans.",M2

19835849,"The auditory response properties of single-on and double-on responders in the inferior colliculus of the leaf-nosed <e>bat</e>, Hipposideros armiger.The present study examines the response properties of neurons in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (IC) of the CF-FM (constant frequency-frequency-modulated) bat, Hipposideros armiger using CF, FM and CF-FM sounds as stimuli. All 169 IC neurons recorded are tonotopically organized along the dorsoventral axis of the IC. Collicular neurons have V-shaped or upper-threshold frequency tuning curves. Those neurons tuned at the predominant second harmonic have extremely sharp frequency tuning curves and low minimum thresholds. Collicular neurons typically discharge impulses to both CF and FM sounds. However, when stimulated with CF-FM sounds, most (76%) neurons only discharge impulses to the onset of CF-FM sounds (single-on responders). The remaining neurons (24%) discharge impulses to both CF and FM components (double-on responders) of CF-FM sounds. The double-on responders have higher minimum threshold and longer latency to the FM component than to the CF component of CF-FM sounds. Our data show that the FM component of the CF-FM sounds contributes significantly in shaping the discharge pattern, latency and number of impulses of IC neurons. The present study suggests that using CF-FM sounds to study auditory response properties of the CF-FM bat may be essential for a better understanding of echo analysis by the CF-FM in the real world. Because the double-on responders have shorter response latency than single-on responders, we speculate that these two types of responders may be best suited for echo analysis during different phases of hunting.",M2
19812069,"Complex vocal imitation during ontogeny in a <e>bat</e>.Vocal imitation--the ability to learn a previously unknown acoustic signal from a tutor--is considered to be a key innovation in the evolution of speech. This faculty is very rare and patchily distributed within the animal kingdom, suggesting multiple instances of convergent evolution. It has long been predicted that bats should be capable of vocal imitation and our results provide evidence for this phenomenon. We report that pups of the bat Saccopteryx bilineata learn a complex vocalization through vocal imitation. During ontogeny, pups of both sexes imitate territorial song from adult males, starting with simple precursor songs that develop into genuine renditions. The resemblance of pup renditions to their acoustic model is not caused by physical maturation effects, is independent of pups' gender and relatedness towards adult males and becomes more pronounced during ontogeny, showing that auditory experience is essential for vocal development. Our findings indicate that the faculty of vocal imitation is more widespread than previously thought and emphasize the importance of research on audiovocal communication in bats for a better understanding of the evolutionary origin of vocal imitation.",M2
19802737,"Distribution and ultrastructure of Merkel cell of the fishing <e>bat</e> (Myotis ricketti).The distribution and ultrastructure of Merkel cells were described in detail in piscivorous bats through immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The findings indicated that Merkel cells are commonly found in raised-domes, hair follicles and in the basal epidermis of the skin from their back, abdomen, intercrural membranes, wing membranes and footpads. However, the density of Merkel cells is significantly higher in the footpad than in other places. These results suggested that there may be a link between Merkel cells and tactile sense, and also might imply that raised-domes with air-flow sensitive hairs played an important role in adjusting flying gestures by monitoring the air flow around the body. The ultrastructure of Merkel cells is similar to other vertebrates except having more intermediate filaments and larger granules.",M2
19799521,"Determining feeding state and rate of mass change in insectivorous <e>bats</e> using plasma metabolite analysis.Insectivorous bats regularly experience dramatic and sometimes rapid changes in nutrient stores, yet our ability to study these changes has been limited by available techniques. Plasma metabolite analysis has proven effective for studying individual rates of mass change in birds but has not been validated for other taxa. We tested the effectiveness of plasma metabolite analysis by conducting a study with captive big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) in the field. In the lab, we varied food availability to induce various rates of mass change. As predicted, individual rate of mass change was positively correlated with plasma triglyceride concentration, but there was no relationship with plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration, whereas such a relationship has been found in birds. In the field, we collected blood samples from postlactating females as they emerged in the evening (fasted) and when they returned from feeding in the morning. Plasma triglyceride concentration was greater in fed bats than fasted bats, and the increase was less when rain limited foraging. Contrary to predictions, beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration was also greater in fed bats than fasted bats. Analysis of plasma triglyceride concentration provides a technique for assessing individual feeding state and rate of mass change of bats and will facilitate further study of bat nutritional ecology and energetics.",M2
19789409,"The microstructure of lingual papillae in the Egyptian fruit <e>bat</e> (Rousettus aegyptiacus) as observed by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.The microstructure of lingual papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue of adult Egyptian fruit bats was examined by light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This elongated tongue with a rounded apex is approximately 3 cm long -- including the 1.7cm length of the anterior free part of the tongue -- which facilitates considerable freedom of movement. The surface of the tongue has four types of lingual papillae: two types of mechanical papillae -- filiform and conical papillae, and two types of gustatory papillae -- fungiform and vallate papillae. Most numerous are filiform papillae with well developed keratinized processes represented by four morphological subtypes -- small, giant, elongated, and bifid papillae. Our observations showed the small and giant filiform papillae to be present in the anterior part of the tongue and tilted to the back of the tongue. In the posterior part of the tongue, the filiform papillae with elongated processes were arranged on each side of the tongue and oriented perpendicularly to the median line of tongue. This arrangement of filiform papillae is considered to be useful for the efficient uptake of semiliquid food as it can be collected toward the median line of the tongue. Gustatory fungiform papillae were distributed among filiform papillae on the border of the apex and the anterior part of the body of the tongue and also on the posterior part of the tongue, while three vallate papillae surrounded by conical papillae were found on the root of the tongue. There were also taste buds along the ducts of the posterior lingual glands in the posterior-lateral part of the tongue. These morphological features are discussed in relation to adaptation to food uptake in the Egyptian fruit bat.",M2
19789175,"The evolution of <e>bat</e> pollination: a phylogenetic perspective.BACKGROUND: Most tropical and subtropical plants are biotically pollinated, and insects are the major pollinators. A small but ecologically and economically important group of plants classified in 28 orders, 67 families and about 528 species of angiosperms are pollinated by nectar-feeding bats. From a phylogenetic perspective this is a derived pollination mode involving a relatively large and energetically expensive pollinator. Here its ecological and evolutionary consequences are explored. SCOPE AND CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes adaptations in bats and plants that facilitate this interaction and discusses the evolution of bat pollination from a plant phylogenetic perspective. Two families of bats contain specialized flower visitors, one in the Old World and one in the New World. Adaptation to pollination by bats has evolved independently many times from a variety of ancestral conditions, including insect-, bird- and non-volant mammal-pollination. Bat pollination predominates in very few families but is relatively common in certain angiosperm subfamilies and tribes. We propose that flower-visiting bats provide two important benefits to plants: they deposit large amounts of pollen and a variety of pollen genotypes on plant stigmas and, compared with many other pollinators, they are long-distance pollen dispersers. Bat pollination tends to occur in plants that occur in low densities and in lineages producing large flowers. In highly fragmented tropical habitats, nectar bats play an important role in maintaining the genetic continuity of plant populations and thus have considerable conservation value.",M2

19787423,"Light-induced COP9 signalosome expression in the Indian false vampire <e>bat</e> Megaderma lyra.The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a multi-subunit protein complex conserved in plants and animals. CSN subunits have been identified as light-mediated master regulators of eukaryotic circadian clocks from fungi to animals. The Indian false vampire bat Megaderma lyra is completely adapted to an anthropic biotope and behavioral studies have reported that M. lyra exhibits light-sampling behavior to assess environmental light. LC-MS-MS results for a 36 kDa protein were analyzed using the Sequest search engine, and COP9 signalosome subunit 5 (CSN5) was pinpointed as having the highest score with 6 matching peptides. To confirm the presence of CSN5, up-regulated cDNA was amplified, sequenced, and identified as CSN5. Furthermore, semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the level of induction of CSN5 was regulated by environmental light. We estimated the level of expression across a light-dark cycle and observed a higher level of expression at the end of the light phase. Similarly, when the animal was shifted from continuous dark to light, CSN5 expression was induced. Correspondingly, we detected the similar pattern of translated protein with JAB1 antibody. Knowledge about the circadian rhythm and its molecular mechanism in Chiroptera is very limited and this study suggests that CSN5 might be involved in the M. lyra light-signaling process.",M2
19785757,"Large serological survey showing cocirculation of Ebola and Marburg viruses in Gabonese <e>bat</e> populations, and a high seroprevalence of both viruses in Rousettus aegyptiacus.BACKGROUND: Ebola and Marburg viruses cause highly lethal hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Recently, bats of multiple species have been identified as possible natural hosts of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) in Gabon and Republic of Congo, and also of marburgvirus (MARV) in Gabon and Democratic Republic of Congo. METHODS: We tested 2147 bats belonging to at least nine species sampled between 2003 and 2008 in three regions of Gabon and in the Ebola epidemic region of north Congo for IgG antibodies specific for ZEBOV and MARV. RESULTS: Overall, IgG antibodies to ZEBOV and MARV were found in 4% and 1% of bats, respectively. ZEBOV-specific antibodies were found in six bat species (Epomops franqueti, Hypsignathus monstrosus, Myonycteris torquata, Micropteropus pusillus, Mops condylurus and Rousettus aegyptiacus), while MARV-specific antibodies were only found in Rousettus aegyptiacus and Hypsignathus monstrosus. The prevalence of MARV-specific IgG was significantly higher in R. aegyptiacus members captured inside caves than elsewhere. No significant difference in prevalence was found according to age or gender. A higher prevalence of ZEBOV-specific IgG was found in pregnant females than in non pregnant females. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm that ZEBOV and MARV co-circulate in Gabon, the only country where bats infected by each virus have been found. IgG antibodies to both viruses were detected only in Rousettus aegyptiacus, suggesting that this bat species may be involved in the natural cycle of both Marburg and Ebola viruses. The presence of MARV in Gabon indicates a potential risk for a first human outbreak. Disease surveillance should be enhanced in areas near caves.",M2

19777200,"Release from <e>bats</e>: genetic distance and sensoribehavioural regression in the Pacific field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus.The auditory thresholds of the AN2 interneuron and the behavioural thresholds of the anti-bat flight-steering responses that this cell evokes are less sensitive in female Pacific field crickets that live where bats have never existed (Moorea) compared with individuals subjected to intense levels of bat predation (Australia). In contrast, the sensitivity of the auditory interneuron, ON1 which participates in the processing of both social signals and bat calls, and the thresholds for flight orientation to a model of the calling song of male crickets show few differences between the two populations. Genetic analyses confirm that the two populations are significantly distinct, and we conclude that the absence of bats has caused partial regression in the nervous control of a defensive behaviour in this insect. This study represents the first examination of natural evolutionary regression in the neural basis of a behaviour along a selection gradient within a single species.",M2
19769034,"Experimental assessment of the impacts of northern long-eared <e>bats</e> on ovipositing Culex (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes.The importance of predation as a mortality factor in adult mosquitoes has received only limited attention in the scientific literature. Despite the lack of consensus among researchers as to whether bats are important predators of mosquitoes, there have been no attempts to directly document the effect of bats on mosquito populations or behavior. We conducted an enclosure experiment to test the hypothesis that bats reduce the local abundance of ovipositing female mosquitoes by examining whether the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis Trouessart) had an effect on Culex spp. (Diptera: Culicidae) oviposition, using naturally occurring mosquitoes, either through direct predation or trait mediated effects on mosquito behavior. We found a significant, 32% reduction in egg-laying activity associated with bat predation. Artificial oviposition habitats directly outside bat enclosures experienced no reduction in oviposition; we attributed the observed reduction in egg-laying activity to direct predation on ovipositing females by bats and not changes in mosquito behavior. In addition, we noted a decrease in the number of larval mosquitoes in enclosures exposed to bat predation. These results suggest the impact of aerial predators on pathogen transmission may be large, and warrants further scientific investigation.",M2

The prevalence of trypanosome-infected bats, as estimated by haemoculture, was 12.9%, resulting in 77 cultures of isolates, most morphologically identified as Trypanosoma cf. cruzi, classified by barcoding using partial sequences from ssrRNA gene into the subgenus Schizotrypanum and identified as T. cruzi (15), T. cruzi marinkellei (37) or T. cf. dionisii (25). Phylogenetic analyses using nuclear ssrRNA, glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene sequences generated three clades, which clustered together forming the subgenus Schizotrypanum. In addition to vector association, bat trypanosomes were related by the evolutionary history, ecology and phylogeography of the bats. Trypanosoma cf. dionisii trypanosomes (32.4%) infected 12 species from four bat families captured in all biomes, from North to South Brazil, and clustered with T. dionisii from Europe despite being separated by some genetic distance.

19764352,"Involvement of GABA-mediated inhibition in shaping the frequency selectivity of neurons in the inferior colliculus of the big brown <e>bat</e>, Eptesicus fuscus.In central auditory signal processing, neural inhibition plays an important role in sharpening the selectivity of auditory neurons. The present study examines the involvement of GABA-mediated inhibition in shaping the frequency selectivity of neurons in the bat inferior colliculus (IC) using forward masking paradigm and bicuculline application. At each study session, we recorded two IC neurons with a pair of electrodes and reciprocally studied whether a sound that served as a probe to elicit response of one neuron might serve as a masker to affect the frequency tuning curve (FTC) of the other paired neuron. Among the 33 pairs of IC neurons recorded, this forward masking paradigm produces sharpening of the FTC in 29 (88%) pairs of IC neurons and broadening of the FTC in 4 (12%) pairs of IC neurons. The degree of sharpening of FTC decreases with recording depth as well as with the difference in the best frequency and recording depth between each pair of IC neurons. Although bicuculline application broadens the FTC of all IC neurons, forward masking still produces sharpening of the FTC in most IC neurons. These data suggest that population of IC neurons are highly correlated during frequency analysis such that frequency selectivity of some groups of IC neurons is improved through inhibition while the spectrum of frequency sensitivity of other groups of IC neurons is enhanced through excitation. Biological significance of these data relevant to acoustic signal processing is discussed.",M2

Temperature-telemetry revealed that bats used torpor on 85% of observation days and on 38% of all nights. Torpor bouts ranged from 0.7 to 21.2 h, but the relationship between duration of torpor bouts and ambient temperature was not significant. However, skin temperature of torpid bats was positively correlated with ambient temperature. Against predictions, individuals with a high body condition index (i.e., good fat/energy reserves) expressed longer and deeper torpor bouts and also employed torpor more often during the activity phase at night than those with low body condition index. We provide the first evidence that use of torpor in a free-ranging subtropical mammal is positively related with high body condition index. This suggests that employment of torpor is maximised and foraging minimised not because of food shortages or low energy stores but likely to avoid predation when bats are not required to feed.",M2
