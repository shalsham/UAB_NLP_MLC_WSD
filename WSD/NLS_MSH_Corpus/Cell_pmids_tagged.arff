20501947,"Uric acid promotes an acute inflammatory response to sterile <e>cell</e> death in mice.Necrosis stimulates inflammation, and this response is medically relevant because it contributes to the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. It is thought that necrosis stimulates inflammation because dying cells release proinflammatory molecules that are recognized by the immune system. However, relatively little is known about the molecular identity of these molecules and their contribution to responses in vivo. Here, we investigated the role of uric acid in the inflammatory response to necrotic cells in mice. We found that dead cells not only released intracellular stores of uric acid but also produced it in large amounts postmortem as nucleic acids were degraded. Using newly developed Tg mice that have reduced levels of uric acid either intracellularly and/or extracellularly, we found that uric acid depletion substantially reduces the cell death-induced inflammatory response. Similar results were obtained with pharmacological treatments that reduced uric acid levels either by blocking its synthesis or hydrolyzing it in the extracellular fluids. Importantly, uric acid depletion selectively inhibited the inflammatory response to dying cells but not to microbial molecules or sterile irritant particles. Collectively, our data identify uric acid as a proinflammatory molecule released from dying cells that contributes significantly to the cell death-induced inflammatory responses in vivo.",M1
20499615,"Omnis fibra ex fibra: fibre economies in Bonnet's and Diderot's models of organic order.In a long-term transformation, that begins in Antiquity but takes a crucial turn in the Renaissance anatomies, the  fibre  becomes from around 1750 the operative building block and at the same time the first unifying principle of function-structure-complexes of organic bodies. It occupies the role that the <e>cell</e> takes up in the cell economies of the second third of the nineteenth century. In this paper, I will first discuss some key notions, technical analogies, and images that are related to  fibre -concepts from Andreas Vesalius to Albrecht von Haller and then focus on Charles Bonnet's and Denis Diderot's fibre ceconomies. In Bonnet's and Diderot's fibre economies, the self-active, regulating properties of fibre-agents and their material structures, that reach from fibre bundles, tissues and membranes to apparati of organs, are united within the concrete whole of individual organized  systems  or  networks.

20495554,"RhoL controls invasion and Rap1 localization during immune <e>cell</e> transmigration in Drosophila.Human immune cells have to penetrate an endothelial barrier during their beneficial pursuit of infection and their destructive infiltration of tissues in autoimmune diseases. This transmigration requires Rap1 GTPase to activate integrin affinity. We define a new model system for this process by demonstrating, with live imaging and genetics, that during embryonic development Drosophila melanogaster immune cells penetrate an epithelial, Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-cadherin)-based tissue barrier. A mutant in RhoL, a GTPase homologue that is specifically expressed in haemocytes, blocks this invasive step but not other aspects of guided migration. RhoL mediates integrin adhesion caused by Drosophila Rap1 overexpression and moves Rap1 away from a concentration in the cytoplasm to the leading edge during invasive migration. These findings indicate that a programmed migratory step during Drosophila development bears striking molecular similarities to vertebrate immune cell transmigration during inflammation, and identify RhoL as a new regulator of invasion, adhesion and Rap1 localization. Our work establishes the utility of Drosophila for identifying novel components of immune cell transmigration and for understanding the in vivo interplay of immune cells with the barriers they penetrate.",M1

20484820,"PET probes for distinct metabolic pathways have different <e>cell</e> specificities during immune responses in mice.Clinical tools that measure changes in immune cell metabolism would improve the diagnosis and treatment of immune dysfunction. PET, utilizing probes for specific metabolic processes, detects regions of immune activation in vivo. In this study we investigated the immune cell specificity of PET probes for two different metabolic pathways: [18F]-2-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) for glycolysis and [18F]-2-fluoro-D-(arabinofuranosyl)cytosine ([18F]-FAC) for deoxycytidine salvage. We isolated innate and adaptive immune cells from tissues of mice challenged with a retrovirus-induced sarcoma and measured their ability to accumulate FDG and FAC. We determined that the two probes had distinct patterns of accumulation: FDG accumulated to the highest levels in innate immune cells, while FAC accumulated predominantly in CD8+ T cells in a manner that correlated with cellular proliferation. This study demonstrates that innate and adaptive cell types differ in glycolytic and deoxycytidine salvage demands during an immune response and that these differential metabolic requirements can be detected with specific PET probes. Our findings have implications for the interpretation of clinical PET scans that use [18F]-FDG or [18F]-FAC to assess immune function in vivo and suggest potential applications of metabolic PET to monitor the effects of targeted immune modulation.",M1

Much of our knowledge is based on ensemble measurements. However, cell-to-cell differences are always present to some degree in any cell population, and the ensemble behaviors of a population may not represent the behaviors of any individual cell. Here, we discuss examples of when heterogeneity cannot be ignored and describe practical strategies for analyzing and interpreting cellular heterogeneity.",M1
20458142,"Shank-interacting protein-like 1 promotes tumorigenesis via PTEN inhibition in human tumor <e>cells</e>.Inactivation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a critical step during tumorigenesis, and PTEN inactivation by genetic and epigenetic means has been well studied. There is also evidence suggesting that PTEN negative regulators (PTEN-NRs) have a role in PTEN inactivation during tumorigenesis, but their identity has remained elusive. Here we have identified shank-interacting protein-like 1 (SIPL1) as a PTEN-NR in human tumor cell lines and human primary cervical cancer cells. Ectopic SIPL1 expression protected human U87 glioma cells from PTEN-mediated growth inhibition and promoted the formation of HeLa cell-derived xenograft tumors in immunocompromised mice. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIPL1 expression inhibited the growth of both HeLa cells and DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft tumor model. These inhibitions were reversed by concomitant knockdown of PTEN, demonstrating that SIPL1 affects tumorigenesis via inhibition of PTEN function. Mechanistically, SIPL1 was found to interact with PTEN through its ubiquitin-like domain (UBL), inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) phosphatase activity of PTEN. Furthermore, SIPL1 expression correlated with loss of PTEN function in PTEN-positive human primary cervical cancer tissue. Taken together, these observations indicate that SIPL1 is a PTEN-NR and that it facilitates tumorigenesis, at least in part, through its PTEN inhibitory function.",M1
20458138,"Paracrine signaling by glial <e>cell</e>-derived triiodothyronine activates neuronal gene expression in the rodent brain and human cells.Hypothyroidism in humans is characterized by severe neurological consequences that are often irreversible, highlighting the critical role of thyroid hormone (TH) in the brain. Despite this, not much is known about the signaling pathways that control TH action in the brain. What is known is that the prohormone thyroxine (T4) is converted to the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) by type 2 deiodinase (D2) and that this occurs in astrocytes, while TH receptors and type 3 deiodinase (D3), which inactivates T3, are found in adjacent neurons. Here, we modeled TH action in the brain using an in vitro coculture system of D2-expressing H4 human glioma cells and D3-expressing SK-N-AS human neuroblastoma cells. We found that glial cell D2 activity resulted in increased T3 production, which acted in a paracrine fashion to induce T3-responsive genes, including ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (ENPP2), in the cocultured neurons. D3 activity in the neurons modulated these effects. Furthermore, this paracrine pathway was regulated by signals such as hypoxia, hedgehog signaling, and LPS-induced inflammation, as evidenced both in the in vitro coculture system and in in vivo rat models of brain ischemia and mouse models of inflammation. This study therefore presents what we believe to be the first direct evidence for a paracrine loop linking glial D2 activity to TH receptors in neurons, thereby identifying deiodinases as potential control points for the regulation of TH signaling in the brain during health and disease.",M1
20417633,"Identification of residues critical for the <e>cell</e>-membrane-penetrating activity of zebrafish neuroglobin.Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a globin found in the vertebrate brain. Recently, we found that zebrafish Ngb can translocate into cells and clarified that module M1 of zebrafish Ngb is important for protein transduction. In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues of module M1 that are important for protein transduction. We show that Lys7, Lys9, Lys21, and Lys23 of zebrafish Ngb are crucial for its activity. Since these residues are conserved among fishes, but not among mammals, birds, or amphibians, the ability to penetrate cell membranes may be a unique characteristic of fish Ngb proteins.",M1

Cell encapsulation is primary machinery for cell transplantation and new materials and approaches were developed to encapsulate various types of cells to treat a wide range of diseases. This technology involves placing the transplanted cells within a biocompatible membrane in attempt to isolate the cells from the host immune attack and enhance or prolong their function in vivo. In this chapter, we will review the situation of cell microencapsulation field and discuss its potentials and challenges for cell therapy and regeneration of tissue function.",M1

This cell-based technology permits the local and long-term delivery ofa desired therapeutic product reducing or even avoiding the need ofimmunosuppressant drugs. The choice of a suitable material preserving the viability and functionality of enclosed cells becomes fundamental if a therapeutic aim is intended. Alginate, which is by far the most frequently used biomaterial in the field of cell microencapsulation, has been demonstrated to be probably the best polymer for this purpose due to its biocompatibility, easy manipulation, gel forming capacity and in vivo performance.",M1
20384213,"Highlights and trends in <e>cell</e> encapsulation.The exciting developments in the field of drug delivery have already had an enormous impact on medical technology, facilitating the administration of many drugs and improving the pharmacokinetics of many others. The past few years have also seen several firsts, including the design of novel tissue engineered approaches, intriguing advances in the fields of biomaterials and cell therapy and the improvements in the fabrication of more refined and tailored micro and nanocarriers for protein and drug delivery. The sinergy of some of these promising fields have fuelled the progress of cell encapsulation technology, a relatively old concept pioneered 60 years ago. The ability to combine cells and polymer scaffolds to create  living cell medicines  that provide long-term drug delivery has opened new doors in the use of allografts. In fact, transplanted cells may be isolated from the host's immune system by embedding them in a permeable device that controls the outward and inward diffusion of molecules and cells. As a result of this, the requirement for immunosuppresant drugs can be eliminated or at least reduced. At present, the burgeoning number of cutting edge discoveries is leading to the design ofbiomimetic and biodegradable microcarriers that can easily combined with stem cells. The latter will improve the protection and transport of the cells to the target injured tissue and then promote cell integration and consequently tissue repair or regeneration. In the present reviews, we discussed the state of the art in the field of cell encapsulation technology. This book describes the most relevant aspects of the design and development of cell-loaded microcapsules. Some of the most interesting therapeutic applications of this technology are presented as are some of the limitations, future challenges and directions in the field.",M1

20379569,"Wireless induction heating in a microfluidic device for <e>cell</e> lysis.A wireless induction heating system in a microfluidic device was devised for cell lysis to extract DNA and RNA from Escherichia coli. The thermal responses of nickel, iron and copper heating units were studied by applying an alternating magnetic field as a function of geometry of unit, strength of magnetic field, and kind of metal. Heating units were prepared by cutting metal film using a fiber laser, and the units were integrated into a microchannel system using a soft lithographic process. Variation and distribution of temperature on the surface of the heating units was observed using a thermographic camera and temperature labels. The amount of protein released from E. coli by thermal lysis was determined by protein concentration measurement. Hemoglobin released from red blood cells was observed using colorimetric intensity measurement. Extracted DNA was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the profile was compared with that of a positive control of ultrasonically disrupted E. coli. The stability of RNA extracted by induction heating was quantified by the measurement of 23S/16S rRNA ratio and comparison with that by normal RNA extraction kit as a gold standard. A solid-shaped nickel structure was selected as the induction heating element in the microfluidic device because of the relatively small influence of geometries and faster thermal response.The amount of protein extracted from E. coli and hemoglobin released from red blood cells by induction heating of the nickel unit in the microfluidic device was proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. The lysis of E. coli by induction heating was as effective as lysis of DNA by the ultrasonication method because the threshold cycle values of the sample were compatible with those of the positive control as measured by ultrasonication. Thermal lysis of E. coli by induction heating represents a reasonable alternative to a commercial RNA extraction method as shown by the comparative ratio of 23S/16S obtained. In this study, wireless induction heating in a microfluidic device achieved convenience, portability, and economic efficiency by wireless operation, easy fabrication, disposability, and treatment of a large number of cells.",M1
20371106,"Regulation of anisotropic <e>cell</e> expansion in higher plants.Plant growth and development depend on anisotropic cell expansion. Cell wall yielding provides the driving force for cell expansion, and is regulated in part by the oriented deposition of cellulose microfibrils around the cell. Our current understanding of anisotropic cell expansion combines hypotheses generated by more than 50 years of research. Here, we discuss the evolving views of researchers in the field of cellulose synthesis, and highlight several unresolved questions. Recent results using live-cell imaging have illustrated novel roles for cortical microtubules in cellulose synthesis, and further research using these approaches promises to reveal exciting links between the cytoskeleton, intracellular trafficking, and anisotropic growth.",M1
20365612,"Evaluation of biological <e>cell</e> properties using dynamic indentation measurement.Viscoelastic mechanical properties of biological cells are commonly measured using atomic force microscope (AFM) dynamic indentation with spherical tips. A semiempirical analysis based on numerical simulation is built to determine the cell mechanical properties. It is shown that the existing analysis cannot reflect the accurate values of cell elastic/dynamic modulus due to the effects of substrate, indenter tip size, and cell size. Among these factors, substrate not only increases the true contact radius but also interferes the indentation stress field, which can cause the overestimation of cell moduli. Typically, the substrate effect is much stronger than the other two influences in cell indentation; and, thus, the cell modulii are usually overestimated. It is estimated that the moduli can be overestimated by as high as over 200% using the existing analysis. In order to obtain the accurate properties of cells, correction factors that account for these effects are required in the existing analysis.",M1
20355555,"Carboxyl-functionalized and bio-conjugated silica-coated quantum dots as targeting probes for <e>cell</e> imaging.We report the synthesis of carboxyl-functionalized silica-coated CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) via a reverse microemulsion approach. This facile method does not need to change the solvent phase of the nanoparticles during the synthesis process, and requires no other reaction condition such as high temperature or inertia atmosphere. The synthesized nanoparticles have many advantages, such as mono-dispersed and stable in aqueous solution, minimal non-specific targeting, and more direct and cost-effective for bio-conjugation. The carboxyl functionalized nanoparticles were further conjugated with apo-transferrin for receptor-mediated targeting in cancer cell lines. In vitro experiments have revealed that the cellular uptake of Tf-conjugated nanoparticles was significantly higher than that of (only-)carboxyl functionalized nanoparticles in HeLa cells, which are well known to overexpress the transferrin-receptor. The bio-conjugated nanoparticles are potentially useful as efficient probes for bio-diagnosis, both in vitro and in vivo.",M1
20347812,"Evidence for leptin receptor isoforms heteromerization at the <e>cell</e> surface.Leptin mediates its metabolic effects through several leptin receptor (LEP-R) isoforms. In humans, long (LEPRb) and short (LEPRa,c,d) isoforms are generated by alternative splicing. Most of leptin's effects are believed to be mediated by the OB-Rb isoform. However, the role of short LEPR isoforms and the possible existence of heteromers between different isoforms are poorly understood. Using BRET1 and optimized co-immunoprecipitation, we observed LEPRa/b and LEPRb/c heteromers located at the plasma membrane and stabilized by leptin. Given the widespread coexpression of LEPRa and LEPRb, our results suggest that LEPRa/b heteromers may represent a major receptor species in most tissues.",M1

20306515,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional proteins (AIMPs): a triad for cellular homeostasis.Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are highly conserved for efficient and precise translation of genetic codes. In higher eukaryotic systems, several different ARSs including glutamyl-prolyl-, isoelucyl-, leucyl-, methionyl-, glutaminyl-, lysyl-, arginyl-, and aspartyl-tRNA synthetase form a macromolecular protein complex with three nonenzymatic cofactors (AIMP1/p43, AIMP2/p38, and AIMP3/p18). Although the structure and functional implications for this complex formation are not completely understood, rapidly accumulating evidences suggest that this complex would work as a molecular hub linked to the multiple signaling pathways that involve the components of enzymes and cofactors. In this article, the roles of three nonenzymatic components of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex in the assembly of the components and in <e>cell</e> regulation are addressed.",M1
20300672,"Optimization of microfluidic single <e>cell</e> trapping for long-term on-chip culture.The poor efficiency of microfluidic single cell trapping is currently restricting the full potential of state-of-the-art single cell analyses. Using fluid dynamics simulations in combination with particle image velocimetry to systematically optimize trap architectures, we present a microfluidic chip with enhanced single cell trapping and on-chip culture performance. Upon optimization of trap geometries, we measured trapping efficiencies of up to 97%. Our device also enables the stable, relatively long-term culture of individual non-adherent mammalian cells in high-throughput without a significant decrease in cell viability. As a first application of this platform we demonstrate the automated separation of the two daughter cells generated upon single cell division. The reliable trapping and re-trapping of mammalian cells should for example provide the fundament for novel types of investigations in stem cell and tumour cell biology, which depend on reliable tracking of genealogical relationships such as in stem cell lineage tracking.",M1
20298250,"Recycling domains in plant <e>cell</e> morphogenesis: small GTPase effectors, plasma membrane signalling and the exocyst.The Rho/Rop small GTPase regulatory module is central for initiating exocytotically ACDs (active cortical domains) in plant cell cortex, and a growing array of Rop regulators and effectors are being discovered in plants. Structural membrane phospholipids are important constituents of cells as well as signals, and phospholipid-modifying enzymes are well known effectors of small GTPases. We have shown that PLDs (phospholipases D) and their product, PA (phosphatidic acid), belong to the regulators of the secretory pathway in plants. We have also shown that specific NOXs (NADPH oxidases) producing ROS (reactive oxygen species) are involved in cell growth as exemplified by pollen tubes and root hairs. Most plant cells exhibit several distinct plasma membrane domains (ACDs), established and maintained by endocytosis/exocytosis-driven membrane protein recycling. We proposed recently the concept of a 'recycling domain' (RD), uniting the ACD and the connected endosomal recycling compartment (endosome), as a dynamic spatiotemporal entity. We have described a putative GTPase-effector complex exocyst involved in exocytic vesicle tethering in plants. Owing to the multiplicity of its Exo70 subunits, this complex, along with many RabA GTPases (putative recycling endosome organizers), may belong to core regulators of RD organization in plants.",M1

20226003,"Wnt signalling and the control of cellular metabolism.At the cellular level, the biological processes of <e>cell</e> proliferation, growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis are all tightly coupled to appropriate alterations in metabolic status. In the case of cell proliferation, this requires redirecting metabolic pathways to provide the fuel and basic components for new cells. Ultimately, the successful co-ordination of cell-specific biology with cellular metabolism underscores multicellular processes as diverse as embryonic development, adult tissue remodelling and cancer cell biology. The Wnt signalling network has been implicated in all of these areas. While each of the Wnt-dependent signalling pathways are being individually delineated in a range of experimental systems, our understanding of how they integrate and regulate cellular metabolism is still in its infancy. In the present review we reassess the roles of Wnt signalling in functionally linking cellular metabolism to tissue development and function.",M1

Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) produced by Sertoli cells induces the proliferation of undifferentiated spermatogonia. We investigated the effects of Cynomorium songaricum on sperm parameters and GDNF expression in rat testes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sperm analysis, RT-PCR, and Western blotting assays were performed after administration of CS to 8-week-old male Wistar rats for 56 consecutive days (1.0g/kg/day, p.o.), the period of sperm formation in the rat. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The CS-treated animals showed significant increases in epididymal sperm count and absolute testes weights compared to the control group. CS also increased the expression of GDNF at both the mRNA and protein levels. These results suggest that CS may improve male fertility by enhancing spermatogenesis and GDNF expression.",M1

Their diverse biology, their lack of a large set of orthologous genes and the existence of essential linage (and environmentally) specific genes all illustrate the diversity of genes building up naturally evolved minimal cells. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that sometimes the same essential function is performed by genes from different evolutionary origins. Nevertheless, all cells perform a set of life-essential functions however different their cell machinery and environment in which they thrive. An upcoming challenge for biologists will be to discern, by studying differences and similarities in current biodiversity, how cells with reduced genomes have adapted while retaining all basic life-supporting functions.",M1

Although the various artificially made vesicle systems are already remarkably complex, they are still very different from and much simpler than any known living cell. Nevertheless, the preparation and study of the structure and the dynamics of functionalized vesicle systems may contribute to a better understanding of biological cells, in particular of the essential features of a living cell that are not found in the non-living form of matter. The study of protocell models may possibly lead to a better understanding of the origin of the first cells.

20209440,"The effect of superovulation on the contributions of individual blastomeres from 2-<e>cell</e> stage CF1 mouse embryos to the blastocyst.It remains controversial whether blastomeres of 2-cell stage mouse embryos show bias in their contribution to the blastocyst and whether there is any effect of superovulation. Two-cell stage embryos from CF1 mice were derived by either natural breeding (N) or superovulation (S) and cultured in vitro. At blastocyst, inner cell mass and trophectoderm were distinguished by Cdx2 and Oct4 immunostaining. A fluorescent dye (CM-Dil) was also used to tag individual blastomeres at the 2-cell stage, and the descendant cells identified by their red fluorescence. S and N embryos developed to blastocyst at the same rate and contained a similar number of cells. However, with S embryos, the descendants of the blastomere labeled with CM-DiI contributed predominantly to either the embryonic or abembryonic pole about 70% of the time, whereas most N embryos displayed random patterning, with no restriction to one or other of the poles. In S-embryos, but not N-embryos, the leading blastomere at second cleavage contributed preferentially to the embryonic pole of the blastocyst and the lagging blastomere to the abembryonic pole and hence mural trophectoderm. In addition, a tetrahedral rather than a flat morphology at the 4-cell stage of S-embryos was strongly biased to displaying the embryonic/abembryonic pattern at blastocyst. In contrast, S-embryos lacking a zona pellucida resembled N embryos in their patterning. In CF1 mice, superovulation has little effect on development to blastocyst, but enforces a greater degree of lineage restriction than natural breeding, most likely through constraints imposed by the zona pellucida.",M1
20195762,"A stretching device for high-resolution live-<e>cell</e> imaging.Several custom-built and commercially available devices are available to investigate cellular responses to substrate strain. However, analysis of structural dynamics by microscopy in living cells during stretch is not readily feasible. We describe a novel stretch device optimized for high-resolution live-cell imaging. The unit assembles onto standard inverted microscopes and applies constant magnitude or cyclic stretch at physiological magnitudes to cultured cells on elastic membranes. Interchangeable modular indenters enable delivery of equibiaxial and uniaxial stretch profiles. Strain analysis performed by tracking fluorescent microspheres adhered onto the substrate demonstrated reproducible application of stretch profiles. In endothelial cells transiently expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-vimentin and paxillin-DsRed2 and subjected to constant magnitude equibiaxial stretch, the two-dimensional strain tensor demonstrated efficient transmission through the extracellular matrix and focal adhesions. Decreased transmission to the intermediate filament network was measured, and a heterogeneous spatial distribution of maximum stretch magnitude revealed discrete sites of strain focusing. Spatial correlation of vimentin and paxillin displacement vectors provided an estimate of the extent of mechanical coupling between the structures. Interestingly, switching the spatial profile of substrate strain reveals that actin-mediated edge ruffling is not desensitized to repeated mechanostimulation. These initial observations show that the stretch device is compatible with live-cell microscopy and is a novel tool for measuring dynamic structural remodeling under mechanical strain.",M1
20192780,"Rewiring <e>cells</e>: synthetic biology as a tool to interrogate the organizational principles of living systems.The living cell is an incredibly complex entity, and the goal of predictively and quantitatively understanding its function is one of the next great challenges in biology. Much of what we know about the cell concerns its constituent parts, but to a great extent we have yet to decode how these parts are organized to yield complex physiological function. Classically, we have learned about the organization of cellular networks by disrupting them through genetic or chemical means. The emerging discipline of synthetic biology offers an additional, powerful approach to study systems. By rearranging the parts that comprise existing networks, we can gain valuable insight into the hierarchical logic of the networks and identify the modular building blocks that evolution uses to generate innovative function. In addition, by building minimal toy networks, one can systematically explore the relationship between network structure and function. Here, we outline recent work that uses synthetic biology approaches to investigate the organization and function of cellular networks, and describe a vision for a synthetic biology toolkit that could be used to interrogate the design principles of diverse systems.",M1

In this work the cell uptake and phototoxicity of the photosensitizer Zn(II)-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) in dipalmitoyl-phosphatidyl-choline liposomes have been studied in the presence or absence of inhibitors of macropinocytosis (cytochalasin D), and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (dynasore). No differences in the uptake or photodynamic damage were observed in A-549 cells subjected to incubation with either ZnPc alone or in combination with cytochalasin D. On the contrary, co-incubation of A-549 cells with ZnPc and dynasore resulted in a significant decrease of photodamage as well as negligible uptake of the photosensitizer. These results indicate that ZnPc is internalized into cells preferentially by a mechanism of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.",M1

20187109,"Single amino acid resolution of proteolytic fragments generated in individual <e>cells</e>.The complex nature of enzyme regulation mandates that enzyme activity profiles be measured in the context of the intact cell. Single-cell capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled with laser-induced fluorescence is a powerful approach for quantitation and separation of analytes present in small samples and single live cells; however, it does not allow for the definitive identification of the reaction products. On the other hand, mass spectrometry (MS) is able to identify analytes but still lacks the requisite sensitivity for most single-cell analysis applications. Thus, it follows that by determining the relative amounts of reaction products generated in single cells using CE and by producing larger quantities of these products using bulk cell populations to identify them using MS, it is possible to determine enzyme activity profiles in single cells. In this study, the applicability of this approach was demonstrated by examining the intracellular fate of a protease substrate derived from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP). In single live TF-1 cells, three distinct fragments were generated from the beta-APP peptide, which differed by a single uncharged amino acid. The CE measurements indicated that the proteolytic fragment profiles (i.e., the relative amounts of each fragment) were consistent from cell to cell but that they were different from those obtained in cell lysates. Furthermore, measurements obtained at the single cell level made it possible to observe a modest but statistically significant negative correlation between the total amount of beta-APP peptide loaded in cells and the fraction of peptide that remained intact. This study demonstrates how single-cell CE, MS, and peptide substrates can be combined to identify and measure enzyme activities in single live cells.",M1
20169588,"Evolving generalized Voronoi diagrams for accurate cellular image segmentation.Analyzing cellular morphologies on a <e>cell</e>-by-cell basis is vital for drug discovery, cell biology, and many other biological studies. Interactions between cells in their culture environments cause cells to touch each other in acquired microscopy images. Because of this phenomenon, cell segmentation is a challenging task, especially when the cells are of similar brightness and of highly variable shapes. The concept of topological dependence and the maximum common boundary (MCB) algorithm are presented in our previous work (Yu et al., Cytometry Part A 2009;75A:289-297). However, the MCB algorithm suffers a few shortcomings, such as low computational efficiency and difficulties in generalizing to higher dimensions. To overcome these limitations, we present the evolving generalized Voronoi diagram (EGVD) algorithm. Utilizing image intensity and geometric information, EGVD preserves topological dependence easily in both 2D and 3D images, such that touching cells can be segmented satisfactorily. A systematic comparison with other methods demonstrates that EGVD is accurate and much more efficient.",M1
20165970,"Sulfatase activities towards the regulation of <e>cell</e> metabolism and signaling in mammals.In higher vertebrates, sulfatases belong to a conserved family of enzymes that are involved in the regulation of cell metabolism and in developmental cell signaling. They cleave the sulfate from sulfate esters contained in hormones, proteins, and complex macromolecules. A highly conserved cysteine in their active site is post-translationally converted into formylglycine by the formylglycine-generating enzyme encoded by SUMF1 (sulfatase modifying factor 1). This post-translational modification activates all sulfatases. Sulfatases are extensively glycosylated proteins and some of them follow trafficking pathways through cells, being secreted and taken up by distant cells. Many proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids contain sulfated carbohydrates, which are sulfatase substrates. Indeed, sulfatases operate as decoding factors for a large amount of biological information contained in the structures of the sulfated sugar chains that are covalently linked to proteins and lipids. Modifications to these sulfate groups have pivotal roles in modulating specific signaling pathways and cell metabolism in mammals.",M1
20152710,"Preliminary studies of 99mTc-BnAO and its analogues: synthesis, radiolabeling and in vitro <e>cell</e> uptake.INTRODUCTION: (99m)Tc-BnAO is one of the nonnitroimidazole hypoxia markers with the highest citation and could be potentially useful in both oncology and other clinical applications. However, it appears inferior in vitro due to lower absolute accumulation and smaller anoxic/normoxic uptake ratio. It is possible that the analogues of (99m)Tc-BnAO have higher hypoxia selectivity after the ligand of (99m)Tc-BnAO is modified. METHODS: 2,2'-(1,4-Diaminobutane)bis(2-methyl-3-butanone) dioxime (BnAO or HL91) and three novel analogues were synthesized and radiolabeled with technetium-99m. The cellular uptake of the radiolabeled complexes was determined in murine sarcoma S180 cell lines under anoxic and normoxic conditions. RESULTS: (99m)Tc-BnAO and its three novel analogues continuously accumulated in anoxic cells but not in normoxic ones, while the analogues showed earlier hypoxia selectivity and greater anoxic/normoxic differential. CONCLUSIONS: The analogues are superior to (99m)Tc-BnAO in terms of in vitro hypoxia selectivity and are viable candidates for further development as new nonnitroimidazole hypoxia markers in the future.",M1
20149797,"Protein folding requires crowd control in a simulated <e>cell</e>.Macromolecular crowding has a profound effect upon biochemical processes in the cell. We have computationally studied the effect of crowding upon protein folding for 12 small domains in a simulated cell using a coarse-grained protein model, which is based upon Langevin dynamics, designed to unify the often disjoint goals of protein folding simulation and structure prediction. The model can make predictions of native conformation with accuracy comparable with that of the best current template-free models. It is fast enough to enable a more extensive analysis of crowding than previously attempted, studying several proteins at many crowding levels and further random repetitions designed to more closely approximate the ensemble of conformations. We found that when crowding approaches 40% excluded volume, the maximum level found in the cell, proteins fold to fewer native-like states. Notably, when crowding is increased beyond this level, there is a sudden failure of protein folding: proteins fix upon a structure more quickly and become trapped in extended conformations. These results suggest that the ability of small protein domains to fold without the help of chaperones may be an important factor in limiting the degree of macromolecular crowding in the cell. Here, we discuss the possible implications regarding the relationship between protein expression level, protein size, chaperone activity and aggregation.",M1

Genotoxic activity of this hepatotoxin is known but its carcinogenic activity remains to be elucidated. In this work, CYN was assessed for its cell-transforming activity using the Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cell transformation assay. This in vitro assay is used to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of chemical, physical and biological agents in SHE cells, which are primary, normal, diploid, genetically stable and capable of metabolic activation.

20142111,"Finite element simulation of <e>cell</e>-substrate decohesion by laser-induced stress waves.Fundamental to the development and application of biomedical devices is an understanding of the adhesion of cells to substrates. There are many experimental techniques and papers dedicated to the study of cell adhesion. This work aims to elucidate on the cell detachment mechanism in a recently reported cell adhesion measurement experiment by laser-induced stress wave technique. In the experiment the absorption of an Nd:YAG laser pulse generates a stress wave of nanoseconds duration that interacts with and detaches the cell adhered to a Si substrate. Due to the ultra-short timescale involved in the experiment, details of the detachment process were not readily observable. In this work, dynamic finite element method is used to simulate the cell-substrate decohesion process under the laser-induced stress wave loading. The results show that the combined effect of nanosecond stress wave pulse and the specific cell geometry results in a complex stress-strain state along the cell-substrate interface. The principal failure mechanism is large interfacial strains realized from the cell's tendency to spread and elongate on the substrate as a result of substrate acceleration. The cells behave like a soft elastic solid during the detachment process due to the large difference between their characteristic response time and the ultra-short duration of the applied stress wave. Evolution of the cell geometry from hydrophobic to hydrophilic contact results in the same detachment process.",M1

METHODS: A fibroblast cell line (Tri-18; GM02732, 47, XY, +18) was used as the template, and 6 groups were set up in the study. Groups A and B were positive and negative control, respectively; groups C-F were experimental groups involving the MDA products from 1, 2, 5 and 10 cells respectively. In combination of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, the product of each group was assessed based on the genome coverage, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) rate and allele dropout (ADO) rate. RESULTS: The nonspecific product of negative control presented an average call rate of 3.2%. The genome coverage of the MDA product increased from 86.4% to 96.4% with the increasing number of template from 1 to 10 cells, while the LOH rate and ADO rate decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: MDA is a highly efficient and reliable method for whole genome amplification. The fidelity of MDA will be improved significantly with the increasing number of template cells. 10K 2.0 SNP mapping array is a quick, accurate and comprehensive method to evaluate the fidelity of amplified DNA products, but the ADO SNPs should be distinguished from those of preferential amplification from the LOH loci to avoid errors.",M1
20136776,"Cellular internalization of exosomes occurs through phagocytosis.Exosomes play important roles in many physiological and pathological processes. However, the exosome-<e>cell</e> interaction mode and the intracellular trafficking pathway of exosomes in their recipient cells remain unclear. Here, we report that exosomes derived from K562 or MT4 cells are internalized more efficiently by phagocytes than by non-phagocytic cells. Most exosomes were observed attached to the plasma membrane of non-phagocytic cells, while in phagocytic cells these exosomes were found to enter via phagocytosis. Specifically, they moved to phagosomes together with phagocytic polystyrene carboxylate-modified latex beads (biospheres) and were further sorted into phagolysosomes. Moreover, exosome internalization was dependent on the actin cytoskeleton and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and could be inhibited by the knockdown of dynamin2 or overexpression of a dominant-negative form of dynamin2. Further, antibody pretreatment assays demonstrated that tim4 but not tim1 was involved in exosomes uptake. We also found that exosomes did not enter the internalization pathway involving caveolae, macropinocytosis and clathrin-coated vesicles. Our observation that the cellular uptake of exosomes occurs through phagocytosis has important implications for exosome-cell interactions and the exosome intracellular trafficking pathway.",M1
20121947,"A new highly toxic protein isolated from the death cap Amanita phalloides is an L-amino acid oxidase.A new highly cytotoxic protein, toxophallin, was recently isolated from the fruit body of the death cap Amanita phalloides mushroom [Stasyk et al. (2008) Studia Biologica 2, 21-32]. The physico-chemical, chemical and biological characteristics of toxophallin differ distinctly from those of another death cap toxic protein, namely phallolysin. The interaction of toxophallin with target <e>cells</e> is not mediated by a specific cell surface receptor. It induces chromatin condensation, as well as DNA and nucleus fragmentation, which are typical for apoptosis. However, caspase III inhibitor [benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone] did not stop toxophallin-induced DNA fragmentation. Thus, toxophallin uses a caspase-independent pathway of apoptosis induction. In the present study, we applied a complementary approach based on a combination of proteomics and molecular biology tools for the protein identification of toxophallin. The primary structure of toxophallin was partially studied via direct sequencing of its tryptic peptides, followed by PCR-based cloning of the corresponding cDNA. A subsequent bioinformatic search revealed a structural homology of toxophallin with the l-amino acid oxidase of the Laccaria bicolor mushroom. This demonstrates the usefulness of our approach for the identification of proteins in organisms with unknown genomes. We also found a broad substrate specificity of toxophallin with respect to oxidizing selected amino acids. Ascorbic acid inhibited the cytotoxic effect of toxophallin, most likely as a result of scavenging hydrogen peroxide, which is the product of oxidase catalysis. Thus, in addition to highly toxic cyclopeptides and toxic lectin phallolysin, the death cap fruit body contains another cytotoxic protein in the form of an enzyme, namely l-amino acid oxidase.",M1

But an explosive growth in knowledge has given a new dimension to our understanding of this process. It now seems that endocytosis is a master organizer of signalling circuits, with one of its main roles being the resolution of signals in space and time. Many of the functions of endocytosis that are emerging from recent research cannot yet be reconciled with the canonical view of intracellular trafficking but, instead, point to endocytosis being integrated at a deeper level in the cellular 'master plan' (the cellular network of signalling circuits that lie at the base of the cell's make-up). Deconvolution of this level, which we call the 'endocytic matrix', might uncover a fundamental aspect of how a cell is built.",M1

20108219,"Dynamic interactions between <e>cells</e> and their extracellular matrix mediate embryonic development.Cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix microenvironment interact throughout all stages of life. Understanding the continuously changing scope of cell-matrix interactions in vivo is crucial to garner insights into both congenital birth defects and disease progression. A current challenge in the field of developmental biology is to adapt in vitro tools and rapidly evolving imaging technology to study cell-matrix interactions in a complex 4-D environment. In this review, we highlight the dynamic modulation of cell-matrix interactions during development. We propose that individual cell-matrix adhesion proteins are best considered as complex proteins that can play multiple, often seemingly contradictory roles, depending upon the context of the microenvironment. In addition, cell-matrix proteins can also exert different short versus long term effects. It is thus important to consider cell behavior in light of the microenvironment because of the constant and dynamic reciprocal interactions occurring between them. Finally, we suggest that analysis of cell-matrix interactions at multiple levels (molecules, cells, tissues) in vivo is critical for an integrated understanding because different information can be acquired from all size scales.",M1

20085460,"Comparing label-free biosensors for pharmacological screening with <e>cell</e>-based functional assays.The diversity and impact of label-free technologies continues to expand in drug discovery. Two classes of label-free instruments, using either an electrical impedance-based or an optical-based biosensor, are now available for investigating the effects of ligands on cellular targets. Studies of GPCR function have been especially prominent with these instruments due to the importance of this target class in drug discovery. Although both classes of biosensors share similar high sensitivity to changes in cell shape and structure, it is unknown whether these biosensors yield similar results when comparing the same GPCR response. Furthermore, since cell morphology changes induced by GPCRs differ depending on which G-protein is activated, there is potential for these instruments to have differential sensitivities to G-protein signaling. Here 1 impedance (CellKey)- and 2 optical-based instruments (BIND and Epic) are compared using Gi-coupled (ACh M2), Gq-coupled (ACh M1), and Gs-coupled (CRF1) receptors. All 3 instruments were robust in agonist and antagonist modes yielding comparable potencies and assay variance. Both the impedance and optical biosensors showed similar high sensitivity for detecting an endogenous D1/D5 receptor response and a melanocortin-4 receptor inverse agonist (agouti-related protein). The impedance-based biosensor was uniquely able to qualitatively distinguish G-protein coupling and reveal dual signaling by CRF1. Finally, responses with a ligand-gated ion channel, TRPV1, were similarly detectable in each instrument. Thus, despite some differences, both impedance- and optical-based platforms offer robust live-cell, label-free assays well suited to drug discovery and typically yield similar pharmacological profiles for GPCR ligands.",M1
20067402,"Using economy of means to evolve transition rules within 2D cellular automata.Running a cellular automaton (CA) on a rectangular lattice is a time-honored method for studying artificial life on a digital computer. Commonly, the researcher wishes to investigate some specific or general mode of behavior, say, the ability of a coherent pattern of points to glide within the lattice, or to generate copies of itself. This technique has a problem: how to design the transitions table-the set of distinct rules that specify the next content of a <e>cell</e> from its current content and that of its near neighbors. Often the table is painstakingly designed manually, rule by rule. The problem is exacerbated by the potentially vast number of individual rules that need be specified to cover all combinations of center and neighbors when there are several symbols in the alphabet of the CA. In this article a method is presented to have the set of rules evolve automatically while running the CA. The transition table is initially empty, with rules being added as the need arises. A novel principle drives the evolution: maximum economy of means-maximizing the reuse of rules introduced on previous cycles. This method may not be a panacea applicable to all CA studies. Nevertheless, it is sufficiently potent to evolve sets of rules and associated patterns of points that glide (periodically regenerate themselves at another location) and to generate gliding  children  that then  mate  by collision.",M1

The current discussion explores a procedure called optical injection, where a laser field transiently increases the membrane permeability to allow species to be internalized. If the internalized substance is a nucleic acid, such as DNA, RNA or small interfering RNA (siRNA), then the process is called optical transfection.

The demand of new platforms, coupled with availability of terabytes of data has challenged the traditional technique of identifying cell populations by manual methods and resulted in development of high-dimensional analytical methods. RESULTS: In this paper, we present sub-populations analysis of cells at the tissue level by using dynamic features of the cells. We used active contour without edges for segmentation of cells, which preserves the cell morphology, and autoregressive modeling to model cell trajectories. The sub-populations were obtained by clustering static, dynamic and a combination of both features. We were able to identify three unique sub-populations in combined clustering. CONCLUSION: We report a novel method to identify sub-populations using kinetic features and demonstrate that these features improve sub-population analysis at the tissue level.

20053547,"A cellular perspective on conformational disease: the role of genetic background and proteostasis networks.The inherently error-prone nature of protein biosynthesis and turnover leads to a constant flux of destabilized proteins.

During aging, this leads to enhanced instability of the proteome, failure to buffer destabilizing genetic mutations or polymorphisms, and cellular decline.

20050851,"The intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel inhibitor TRAM-34 stimulates proliferation of breast cancer <e>cells</e> via activation of oestrogen receptors.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: K(+) channels play a role in the proliferation of cancer cells. We have investigated the effects of specific K(+) channel inhibitors on basal and oestrogen-stimulated proliferation of breast cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Using the mammary adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 we assayed cell proliferation by radiolabelled thymidine incorporation in the absence or presence of various K(+) channel inhibitors with or without 17beta-oestradiol. KEY RESULTS: Inhibitors of K(v)10.1 and K(Ca)3.1 K(+) channels suppressed basal proliferation of MCF-7 cells, but not oestrogen-stimulated proliferation. TRAM-34, a specific inhibitor of K(Ca)3.1 channels increased or decreased cell proliferation depending on the concentration. At intermediate concentrations (3-10 microM) TRAM-34 increased cell proliferation, whereas at higher concentrations (20-100 microM) TRAM-34 decreased cell proliferation. The enhancement of cell proliferation caused by TRAM-34 was blocked by the oestrogen receptor antagonists ICI182,780 and tamoxifen. TRAM-34 also increased progesterone receptor mRNA expression, decreased oestrogen receptor-alpha mRNA expression and reduced the binding of radiolabelled oestrogen to MCF-7 oestrogen receptor, in each case mimicking the effects of 17beta-oestradiol. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results demonstrate that K(+) channels K(v)10.1 and K(Ca)3.1 play a role in basal, but not oestrogen-stimulated MCF-7 cell proliferation. TRAM-34, as well as inhibiting K(Ca)3.1, directly interacts with the oestrogen receptor and mimics the effects of 17beta-oestradiol on MCF-7 cell proliferation and gene modulation. Our finding that TRAM-34 is able to activate the oestrogen receptor suggests a novel action of this supposedly specific K(+) channel inhibitor and raises concerns of interpretation in its use.",M1
20047149,"Drug targeting: learning from toxin entry and trafficking in mammalian <e>cells</e>.A significant number of therapeutic targets reside inside cells and intracellular organelles. Therapeutics therefore must be able to gain access to cellular compartments, and be able to interact specifically with a given molecule to exert a desired effect. Many naturally occurring toxins perform such targeting with apparent ease, making them excellent paradigms for the delivery of therapeutics to the cell interior. By studying the mechanisms of cell entry, trafficking and modes of toxicity of these model delivery vectors, researchers can decipher how cells transport both endogenous molecules and exogenously applied therapeutics inside cells. Perhaps more importantly, the exploitation of cell binding and trafficking motifs could allow a therapeutic to target specifically, traffic within and escape from cellular compartments; in addition, toxic domains can be used to disrupt cell function specifically for therapeutic purposes. This review provides an overview of recent developments in the understanding of toxin targeting and trafficking, and discusses how these developments could result in opportunities for the design of more specific and efficient systems for therapeutic targeting.",M1

Therefore the potential bioactive effects of two softwood knot (the part of the branch encased in the tree stem) extracts--namely, Pinus banksiana Lamb. (Jack pine) and Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. (Sitka spruce)--were investigated by (1) determining their effects on the viability and antioxidant status of human Jurkat T cells, (2) investigating potential cytoprotective and genoprotective effects against oxidative stress in cultured cells, and (3) assessing their effects on concanavalin A (ConA)-induced interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. Initially, both Jack pine knot and Sitka spruce knot extracts were shown to possess strong antioxidant activity as determined by the ferric reducing antioxidant power assay. When added to Jurkat cells, Jack pine knot extract was more toxic compared with Sitka spruce knot extract, with concentrations that resulted in 50% cell death of 153.0 microg/mL and 376.1 microg/mL, respectively. Supplementation of Jurkat cells with wood knot extracts did not affect their glutathione content or catalase activity. Pretreatment of Jurkat cells with Sitka spruce or Jack pine knot extracts protected against H(2)O(2)-induced cell injury. However, none of the extracts protected against H(2)O(2)-induced DNA damage. Jack pine knots, at a concentration of 30 microg/mL, significantly suppressed ConA-induced IL-2 production.

However, the capital expenses and the cost of reagents necessary to perform such large screens have limited application of this technology. Efforts to miniaturize the screening process have centered on the development of cellular microarrays created on microscope slides that use chemical means to introduce exogenous genetic material into mammalian cells. While this work has demonstrated the feasibility of screening in very small formats, the use of chemical transfection reagents (effective only in a subset of cell lines and not on primary cells) and the lack of defined borders between cells grown in adjacent microspots containing different genetic material (to prevent cell migration and to aid spot location recognition during imaging and phenotype deconvolution) have hampered the spread of this screening technology. Here, we describe proof-of-principles experiments to circumvent these drawbacks. We have created microwell arrays on an electroporation-ready transparent substrate and established procedures to achieve highly efficient parallel introduction of exogenous molecules into human cell lines and primary mouse macrophages. The microwells confine cells and offer multiple advantages during imaging and phenotype analysis. We have also developed a simple method to load this 484-microwell array with libraries of nucleic acids using a standard microarrayer. These advances can be elaborated upon to form the basis of a miniaturized high-throughput functional genomics screening platform to carry out genome-size screens in a variety of mammalian cells that may eventually become a mainstream tool for life science research.",M1

The MFN is sealed with a Si chip having 6 vias and ports that can be left open or connected to high-precision pumps. Liquids are drawn through each chamber in parallel or sequentially at flow rates from 0.1 to 10 microL min(-1). Plugs of liquid as small as 0.5 microL can be passed in one chamber within 5 s to 5 min. Plugs of liquid can also be introduced into a chamber for residence times of up to 30 min. By injecting different liquids into 3 ports, 3 adjacent laminar streams of liquid can be drawn inside one chamber with lateral concentration gradients between the streams ranging from 20 to 500 microm. The flexibility of this device for depositing cells and exposing them to liquids in parallel or serially is illustrated by depositing two types of cells, murine N9 microglia and human SH-S5Y5 neuroblastoma. Microfluidic communication between the chambers is illustrated by stimulating N9 microglia using ATP to induce these cells to release plasma membrane vesicles. The vesicles are drawn through the second chamber containing neuroblastoma and collected in a port of the device for off-chip analysis using confocal fluorescence microscopy.

20012208,"Growth of primary embryo <e>cells</e> in a microculture system.We present optimal perfusion conditions for the growth of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs) and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) using a microfluidic perfusion culture system. In an effort to balance nutrient renewal while ensuring the presence of cell secreted factors, we found that the optimal perfusion rate for culturing primary embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs) in our experimental setting is 10 nL/min with an average flow velocity 0.55 microm/s in the microchannel. Primary mEFs may have a greater dependence on cell secreted factors when compared to their immortalized counterpart 3T3 fibroblasts cultured under similar conditions. Both the seeding density and the perfusion rate are critical for the proliferation of primary cells. A week long cultivation of mEFs and mESCs using the microculture system exhibited similar morphology and viability to those grown in a petri dish. Both mEFs and mESCs were analyzed using fluorescence immunoassays to determine their proliferative status and protein expression. Our results demonstrate that a perfusion-based microculture environment is capable of supporting the highly proliferative status of pluripotent embryonic stem cells.",M1

19997758,"Exploring polyamine regulation by nascent histamine in a human-transfected <e>cell</e> model.There are multiple lines of evidence suggesting interplay between histamine and polyamines in several mammalian cell types. However, the complex metabolic context makes it difficult to elucidate the mechanisms involved. Histamine's effects can be elicited after its binding to any of the four subtypes of G-protein coupled histamine membrane receptors. In addition, intracellular histamine can also interfere with polyamine metabolism, since there are several metabolic connections between the synthesis and degradation pathways of both types of amines. In order to dissect the metabolic effects of intracellular histamine on polyamine metabolism, we chose a well-known cell culture line, i.e., the human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293 cells). Initially, we show that HEK-293 cells lack a polyamine metabolic response to extracellular histamine, even over a wide range of histamine concentrations. HEK-293 cells were transfected with active and inactive versions of human histidine decarboxylase, and changes in many of the overlapping metabolic factors and limiting steps were tested. Overall, the results indicate a regulatory effect of histamine on the post-transcriptional expression of ornithine decarboxylase and suggest that this effect is primarily responsible for the decrease in polyamine synthesis and partial blockade of cell-cycle progression, which should affect cell proliferation rate.",M1
19964779,"Designer protein-based scaffolds for neural tissue engineering.A key attribute missing from many current biomaterials is the ability to independently tune multiple biomaterial properties without simultaneously affecting other material parameters. Because <e>cells</e> are well known to respond to changes in the initial elastic modulus, degradation rate, and cell adhesivity of a biomaterial, it is critical to develop synthetic design strategies that allow decoupled tailoring of each individual parameter in order to systematically optimize cell-scaffold interactions. We present the development of a family of biomimetic scaffolds composed of chemically crosslinked, elastin-like proteins designed to support neural regeneration through a combination of cell adhesion and cell-induced degradation and remodeling. Through use of a modular protein-design strategy, a range of biomaterials is created that allows independent tuning over the initial elastic modulus, degradation rate, cell adhesivity, and neurite outgrowth. By combining these engineered proteins into composite structures, biomaterials are created with 3D patterns that emerge over time in response to cell-secreted enzymes. These dynamic 3D structures enable the delivery of multiple drugs with precise spatial and temporal resolution and also enable the design of biomaterials that adapt to changing scaffold needs.",M1

The features estimated include nuclei count, nuclei size distribution, nuclei eccentricity (roundness) distribution, nuclei closeness distribution and cluster size distribution. Our methodology is a three step technique. Firstly, we generate a binary nuclei mask from an RGB tissue image by color segmentation. Secondly, we segment nuclei clusters present in the binary mask into individual nuclei by concavity detection and ellipse fitting. Finally, we estimate informative features for every nuclei and their distribution for the complete image. The main focus of our work is the development of a fast and accurate nuclei cluster segmentation technique for densely clustered tissue images. We also developed a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for our application which requires minimal user interaction and can efficiently extract features from nuclei clusters, making it feasible for clinical applications (less than 2 minutes for a 1.9 megapixel tissue image).",M1

Importantly, they can be linked to a variety of cargo, including anti-cancer therapeutics, making CPPs an efficient, effective and non-toxic mechanism for drug delivery. In this review, we discuss a number of CPP conjugated therapies (CTTs) that are either patented are in the progress of patenting, and show strong promise for clinical efficacy. The CTTs discussed here target a number of different processes specific to cancer progression, including proliferation, survival and migration. In addition, many of these CTTs also increase sensitivity to current anti-cancer therapy modalities, including radiation and other DNA damaging chemotherapies, thereby decreasing the toxic dosage required for effective treatment. Mechanistically, these CTTs function in a dominant-negative manner by blocking tumor-specific protein-protein interactions with the CPP-conjugated peptide or protein. The treatment of both cell lines and mouse models demonstrates that this method of molecular targeting results in equal if not greater efficacy than current standards of care, including DNA damaging agents and topoisomerase inhibitors. For the treatment of invasive carcinoma, these CTTs have significant clinical potential to deliver highly targeted therapies without sacrificing the patient's quality of life.",M1

We discuss probe requirements arising from the use of single-molecule spectroscopy methods and the customisation of probes that depends on the target molecule, the chemical state of the molecule as well as the distance and the type of interaction between sensor and ligand.

We also discuss additional requirements that arise when performing experiments in living cells like toxicity and cell permeability. Regarding the latter, we devote a special paragraph on the different ways to introduce the desired probe into the cell and how the different properties of each probe and cell type may require different delivery methods. We offer insights based on our experience working with a variety of single-molecule methods, fluorescent probes and delivery systems. Overall, we encompass the latest developments on probe design and delivery and illustrate that the wealth of information provided by single-molecule studies goes along with increased complexity.",M1

This Commentary focuses on a relatively understudied aspect of laminin biology: how is laminin deposited into the extracellular matrix? This topic has fascinated researchers for some time, particularly considering the diversity of patterns of laminin that can be visualized in the matrix of cultured cells. We discuss current ideas of how laminin matrices are assembled, the role of matrix receptors in this process and how laminin-associated proteins modulate matrix deposition. We speculate on the role of signaling pathways that are involved in laminin-matrix deposition and on how laminin patterns might play an important role in specifying cell behaviors, especially directed migration. We conclude with a description of new developments in the way that laminin deposition is being studied, including the use of tagged laminin subunits that should allow the visualization of laminin-matrix deposition and assembly by living cells.",M1

The observations were performed on living cells using laser confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SL). The QDs covered with polyethylenglycol without any functional reactive groups with emission maximum at 565 nm were used in the study. This type of QDs is suggested to prevent an interaction of QDs with biological molecules. It has been shown that QDs do not enter HeLa cells, T-system and sarcoplasm of skeletal muscle fibres.

Maternal CD8 T cell responses directed against fetal antigens can also be detected following pregnancy.

The potentially harmful effects of fetal microchimerism include an association with autoimmune disease and recurrent miscarriage. Beneficial effects that have been explored include the contribution of persistent fetal cells to maternal tissue repair. A link between fetal microchimerism and cancer has also been proposed, with some results supporting a protective role and others, conversely, suggesting a role in tumour development.

Expanding clinical implications to complex human behavioral and somatic disorders.Glucocorticoids contribute to the maintenance of basal and stress-related homeostasis in all higher organisms, and influence a large proportion of the expressed human genome, and their effects spare almost no organs or tissues. Glucocorticoids regulate many functions of the central nervous system, such as arousal, cognition, mood, sleep, the activity and direction of intermediary metabolism, the maintenance of a proper cardiovascular tone, the activity and quality of the immune and inflammatory reaction, including the manifestations of the sickness syndrome, and growth and reproduction. The numerous actions of glucocorticoids are mediated by a set of at least 16 glucocorticoid receptor (GR) isoforms forming homo- or hetero-dimers. The GRs consist of multifunctional domain proteins operating as ligand-dependent transcription factors that interact with many other cell signaling systems, including large and small G proteins. The presence of multiple GR monomers and homo- or hetero-dimers expressed in a cell-specific fashion at different quantities with quantitatively and qualitatively different transcriptional activities suggest that the glucocorticoid signaling system is highly stochastic. Glucocorticoids are heavily involved in human pathophysiology and influence life expectancy. Common behavioral and/or somatic complex disorders, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, chronic pain and fatigue syndromes, obesity, the metabolic syndrome, essential hypertension, diabetes type 2, atherosclerosis with its cardiovascular sequelae, and osteoporosis, as well as autoimmune inflammatory and allergic disorders, all appear to have a glucocorticoid-regulated component.",M1
19905667,"Maximum likelihood and the single receptor.The accuracy by which biological <e>cells</e> sense chemical concentration is ultimately limited by the random arrival of particles at the receptors by diffusion. This fundamental physical limit is generally considered to be the Berg-Purcell limit [Biophys. J. 20, 193 (1977)]. Here we derive a lower limit by applying maximum likelihood to the time series of receptor occupancy. The increased accuracy stems from solely considering the unoccupied time intervals--disregarding the occupied time intervals as these do not contain any information about the external particle concentration, and only decrease the accuracy of the concentration estimate. Receptors which minimize the bound time intervals achieve the highest possible accuracy. We discuss how a cell could implement such an optimal sensing strategy by absorbing or degrading bound particles.",M1

19905151,"From a discrete to a continuum model of <e>cell</e> dynamics in one dimension.Multiscale modeling is emerging as one of the key challenges in mathematical biology. However, the recent rapid increase in the number of modeling methodologies being used to describe cell populations has raised a number of interesting questions. For example, at the cellular scale, how can the appropriate discrete cell-level model be identified in a given context? Additionally, how can the many phenomenological assumptions used in the derivation of models at the continuum scale be related to individual cell behavior? In order to begin to address such questions, we consider a discrete one-dimensional cell-based model in which cells are assumed to interact via linear springs. From the discrete equations of motion, the continuous Rouse [P. E. Rouse, J. Chem. Phys. 21, 1272 (1953)] model is obtained. This formalism readily allows the definition of a cell number density for which a nonlinear  fast  diffusion equation is derived. Excellent agreement is demonstrated between the continuum and discrete models. Subsequently, via the incorporation of cell division, we demonstrate that the derived nonlinear diffusion model is robust to the inclusion of more realistic biological detail. In the limit of stiff springs, where cells can be considered to be incompressible, we show that cell velocity can be directly related to cell production. This assumption is frequently made in the literature but our derivation places limits on its validity. Finally, the model is compared with a model of a similar form recently derived for a different discrete cell-based model and it is shown how the different diffusion coefficients can be understood in terms of the underlying assumptions about cell behavior in the respective discrete models.",M1
19901555,"Artificial induction of autophagy around polystyrene beads in nonphagocytic <e>cells</e>.Autophagy is an intracellular event that acts as an innate cellular defense mechanism to kill invading bacteria such as group A Streptococcus in nonphagocytic epithelial-like cells. The cellular events underlying autophagosome formation upon bacterial invasion remain unclear due to the biochemical complexity associated with uncharacterized bacterial components, and the difficulty of predicting the location as well as the timing of where/when autophagosome formation will take place. To overcome these problems, we monitored autophagosome formation in living nonphagocytic cells by inducing autophagy around artificial micrometer-sized beads instead of bacteria. Beads conjugated with bio-reactive molecules provide a powerful tool for examining biochemical properties in vitro. However, this technique has not been applied to living cells, except for phagocytes, because the beads cannot be easily incorporated into nonphagocytic cells. Here we report that micrometer-sized polystyrene beads coated with transfection reagents containing cationic lipids can be incorporated into nonphagocytic cells, and that autophagy can be efficiently induced around the beads in these cells. Monitoring the process of autophagosome formation for pH-sensitive fluorescent dye (pHrodo)-conjugated beads by fluorescence live cell imaging combined with correlative light and electron microscopy, we found that autophagosomes are formed around the beads after partial breakdown of the endosomal membrane. In addition, the beads were subsequently transferred to lysosomes within a couple of hours. Our findings demonstrate the cellular responses that lead to autophagy in response to pathogen invasion.",M1

Cell penetrating peptides (CPP), also named protein transduction domains, comprise short and usually basic amino acids-rich peptides originating from proteins able to cross biological barriers, such as the viral Tat protein, or are rationally designed. They have emerged as a new class of non-viral vectors allowing the delivery of various biomolecules across biological barriers from low molecular weight drugs to nanosized particles. Encouraging data with CPP-conjugated oligonucleotides have been obtained both in vitro and in vivo in animal models of diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

19888218,"Shifts in growth strategies reflect tradeoffs in cellular economics.The growth rate-dependent regulation of <e>cell</e> size, ribosomal content, and metabolic efficiency follows a common pattern in unicellular organisms: with increasing growth rates, cell size and ribosomal content increase and a shift to energetically inefficient metabolism takes place. The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.",M1

Using live single-cell imaging, we observed that the onset of apoptotic proteolytic activity was tightly synchronized between nearby cells. This synchrony was not a consequence of secreted factors and was not correlated to the cell cycle. The synchrony was only seen amongst related cells and was lost over successive generations. The times of apoptosis also diverged within a generation, but this was blocked by inhibiting protein synthesis before triggering apoptosis. These results suggest that the cell-cell variability of apoptosis times is due to the divergence of the molecular composition of the cell, and that the decision to commit to apoptosis at the time of drug addition is a deterministic decision.",M1

The measurements are thus made with lasers for both the opto-acoustic generation and the acousto-optic detection, and acoustic frequencies as high as 11 GHz can be detected, as reported in this paper. The technique offers perspectives for single cell imaging. The in-plane resolution is limited by the pump and probe spot sizes, i.e. approximately 1 microm, and the in-depth resolution is provided by the acoustic frequencies, typically in the GHz range. The effect of the technique on cell safety is discussed. Experiments achieved in vegetal cells illustrate the reproducibility and sensitivity of the measurements.

Indeed, H. pylori is considered the single most important risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. The vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, secreted by H. pylori, promotes intracellular survival of the bacterium and modulates host immune responses. In a recent study, we reported that VacA induces autophagy. Multilamellar autophagosomes are detected in gastric epithelial cells that are distinct from the large vacuoles formed by VacA. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy stabilizes VacA and reduces vacuolation in the cells indicating that the toxin is being degraded by autophagy, thus limiting toxin-induced host cell damage. Many of the methods that were used for this study are commonly employed techniques that were adapted for H. pylori infection and VacA intoxication. In this paper, we describe the various methods and specific protocols used for the assessment and monitoring of autophagy during H. pylori infection.",M1

19828072,"Analysis and modelling of motility of <e>cell</e> populations with MotoCell.BACKGROUND : Cell motility plays a central role in development, wound-healing and tumour invasion. Cultures of eukaryotic cells are a complex system where most cells move according to 'random' patterns, but may also be induced to a more coordinate migration by means of specific stimuli, such as the presence of chemical attractants or the introduction of a mechanical stimulus. Various tools have been developed that work by keeping track of the paths followed by specific objects and by performing statistical analysis on the recorded path data. The available tools include desktop applications or macros running within a commercial package, which address specific aspects of the process. RESULTS : An online application, MotoCell, was developed to evaluate the motility of cell populations maintained in various experimental conditions. Statistical analysis of cell behaviour consists of the evaluation of descriptive parameters such as average speed and angle, directional persistence, path vector length, calculated for the whole population as well as for each cell and for each step of the migration; in this way the behaviour of a whole cell population may be assessed as a whole or as a sum of individual entities. The directional movement of objects may be studied by eliminating the modulo effect in circular statistics analysis, able to evaluate linear dispersion coefficient (R) and angular dispersion (S) values together with average angles. A case study is provided where the system is used to characterize motility of RasV12 transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts. CONCLUSION : Here we describe a comprehensive tool which takes care of all steps in cell motility analysis, including interactive cell tracking, path editing and statistical analysis of cell movement, all within a freely available online service. Although based on a standard web interface, the program is very fast and interactive and is immediately available to a large number of users, while exploiting the web approach in a very effective way. The ability to evaluate the behaviour of single cells allows to draw the attention on specific correlations, such as linearity of movement and deviation from the expected direction. In addition to population statistics, the analysis of single cells allows to group the cells into subpopulations, or even to evaluate the behaviour of each cell with respect to a variable reference, such as the direction of a wound or the position of the closest cell.",M1

20404707,"Telemedicine through the use of digital <e>cell</e> phone technology in pediatric neurosurgery: a case series.BACKGROUND: Advances in medicine have largely followed advances in technology. Medical strides have been made when physicians and researchers have adapted growing science to target specific problems. A new medical field, telemedicine, has emerged that links physicians with colleagues and patients. Cell phone technology is affordable for almost everyone, and basic models include digital photography. OBJECTIVE: We present a case series exhibiting the utility of digital pictures taken with patients' cell phones. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Our patients had wound infections requiring daily intravenous antibiotics and dressing changes. In years past, these patients would have required prolonged hospitalizations. In the era of managed care, patients with these infections are discharged from the hospital, but close outpatient observation is required to monitor the wound. Our patients lived up to 8 hours away from the hospital. Daily appointments for wound checks in the clinic were not practical. Wounds were thus monitored via cell phone images without the inconvenience of travel and the expense of staying in a local hotel, along with leaving appointments in the clinic available for others with new neurosurgical issues. INTERVENTION: Wound evaluations were conducted with the cameras on patients' cell phones. These images were transmitted to the surgeon via text messaging and emails. CONCLUSION: This application of cell phone technology has been documented previously in the literature of other specialties and could attain greater stature as a legitimate method for close outpatient observation by neurosurgeons if medicolegal issues are addressed.",M2
20397839,"Bioeffects of mobile telephony radiation in relation to its intensity or distance from the antenna.PURPOSE: To examine the bioactivity of GSM 900 and 1800 (Global System for Mobile Telecommunications) radiations, in relation to the distance from the antenna or to the radiation-field intensities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drosophila melanogaster adult insects were exposed to the radiation of a GSM 900/1800 mobile phone antenna at different distances ranging from 0 to 100 cm, and the effect on their reproductive capacity and <e>cell</e> death induction in the gonads by the use of TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling) assay, was studied. RESULTS: These radiations/fields decreased the reproductive capacity by cell death induction, at all the different distances tested. The effect diminished with the distance/decreasing intensities. An increased bioactivity 'window' was revealed at distances of 20-30 cm from the mobile phone antenna, (radiation intensity around 10 microW/cm(2)) where the effect became highest, in relation to smaller or longer distances. The effect diminished considerably for distances longer than 40-50 cm and became not evident for distances longer than 1 m or radiation intensities smaller than 1 microW/cm(2). CONCLUSIONS: GSM bioactivity is highest for intensities down to less than 10 microW/cm(2) and still evident until 1 microW/cm(2) exhibiting 'window' effects.",M2
20388042,"Web-based comprehensive information system for self-management of diabetes mellitus.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a web-based comprehensive information system, consisting of Internet and cellular phone use, on blood glucose control. METHODS: We established eMOD (electronic Management of Diabetes), a web-based ubiquitous information system, for <e>cell</e> phone users along with a website for Internet users to provide diabetes education. We examined whether this information system has the same impact on glycemic control as conventional education for the diabetes patient. Forty volunteers were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the eMOD experimental group (n = 20) or the control group (n = 20). Blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels were evaluated at baseline and after 6 months. RESULTS: The two groups were homogeneous in terms of age, sex, and diabetes' duration at baseline. A1C (from 9.0 +/- 2.3% to 7.5 +/- 1.4%, P = 0.031) and postprandial glucose level (228.1 +/- 79.7 to 173.5 +/- 50.2 mg/dL, P = 0.030) were significantly decreased over time in the intervention group but not in the control group. There was a significant relationship between the change in A1C and the frequency of access to the eMOD system via cellular phone (r = 0.766, P = 0.03; coefficient -0.147). CONCLUSIONS: A1C was improved by a web-based intervention not only via computer but also via cellular phone at 6 months post-initiation in patients with type 2 diabetes. These results indicate that the use of a convenient web-based education system could be more effective for glycemic control than traditional education for diabetes patients.",M2
20373232,"Long-term effects of handheld <e>cell</e> phone laws on driver handheld cell phone use.OBJECTIVES: As of October 2009, seven U.S. states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) ban driving while talking on a handheld cell phone. Long-term effects on driver handheld phone use in D.C., New York State, and Connecticut were examined. METHODS: The percentage of drivers talking on handheld cell phones was measured over time with daytime observation surveys in the jurisdictions with bans and comparison jurisdictions without bans. Trends were modeled using Poisson regression to estimate differences between actual rates and rates that would have been expected without a ban. RESULTS: The D.C. ban immediately lowered the percentage of drivers talking on handheld cell phones by 41 percent. Nearly 5 years later, the rate was 43 percent lower than would have been expected without the ban. Use in Connecticut declined 76 percent immediately after the ban; 3.5 years later, use was 65 percent lower than would have been expected without the ban. In New York, use declined 47 percent immediately after the ban; 7 years later, use was 24 percent lower than expected without the ban. Fifteen months after the laws took effect, compliance in New York was lower than in D.C., and the difference appeared due to more intensive enforcement in D.C. However, this linkage is no longer clear because enforcement in New York picked up such that 2008 levels of enforcement appeared comparable in D.C. and New York, whereas enforcement in Connecticut lagged behind. In all three jurisdictions, the chance that a violator would receive a citation was low, and there were no publicized targeted enforcement campaigns. CONCLUSIONS: Jurisdictional bans have reduced handheld phone use and appear capable of maintaining reductions for the long term. However, it is unknown whether overall phone use is lower because many drivers may have switched to hands-free devices. Further research is needed to determine whether reduced handheld cell phone use has reduced crashes.",M2
20355324,"<e>Cell</e> phone radiations affect early growth of Vigna radiata (mung bean) through biochemical alterations.The indiscriminate use of wireless technologies, particularly of cell phones, has increased the health risks among living organisms including plants. We investigated the impact of cell phone electromagentic field (EMF) radiations (power density, 8.55 microW cm(-2)) on germination, early growth, proteins and carbohydrate contents, and activities of some enzymes in Vigna radiata. Cell phone EMF radiations significantly reduced the seedling length and dry weight of V radiata after exposure for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h. Furthermore, the contents of proteins and carbohydrates were reduced in EMF-exposed plants. However, the activities of proteases, alpha-amylases, beta-amylases, polyphenol oxidases, and peroxidases were enhanced in EMF-exposed radicles indicating their role in providing protection against EMF-induced stress. The study concludes that cell phone EMFs impair early growth of V radiata seedlings by inducing biochemical changes.",M2

There are, however, questions remaining concerning the impact of age-dependent dielectric tissue properties and age-dependent proportions of the skull, face and ear on the global and local absorption, in particular in the brain tissues. In this study, we compare the absorption in various parts of the cortex for different magnetic resonance imaging-based head phantoms of adults and children exposed to different models of mobile phones. The results show that the locally induced fields in children can be significantly higher (&gt;3 dB) in subregions of the brain (cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus) and the eye due to the closer proximity of the phone to these tissues. The increase is even larger for bone marrow (&gt;10 dB) as a result of its significantly high conductivity. Tissues such as the pineal gland show no increase since their distances to the phone are not a function of age. This study, however, confirms previous findings saying that there are no age-dependent changes of the peak spatial SAR when averaged over the entire head.",M2
20202719,"<e>Cell</e> phone cardiopulmonary resuscitation: audio instructions when needed by lay rescuers: a randomized, controlled trial.STUDY OBJECTIVE: Given the ubiquitous presence of cellular telephones, we seek to evaluate the extent to which prerecorded audio cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) instructions delivered by a cell telephone will improve the quality of CPR provided by untrained and trained lay rescuers. METHODS: We randomly assigned both previously CPR trained and untrained volunteers to perform CPR on a manikin for 3 minutes with or without audio assistance from a cell telephone programmed to provide CPR instructions. We measured CPR quality metrics-pauses (ie, no flow time), compression rate (minute), depth (millimeters), and hand placement (percentage correct)-across the 4 groups defined by being either CPR trained or untrained and receiving or not receiving cell telephone CPR instructions. RESULTS: There was no difference in CPR measures for participants who had or had not received previous CPR training. Participants using the cell telephone aid performed better compression rate (100/minute [95% confidence interval (CI) 97 to 103/minute] versus 44/minute [95% CI 38 to 50/minute]), compression depth (41 mm [95% CI 38 to 44 mm] versus 31 mm [95% CI 28 to 34 mm]), hand placement (97% [95% CI 94% to 100%] versus 75% [95% CI 68% to 83%] correct), and fewer pauses (74 seconds [95% CI 72 to 76 seconds] versus 89 seconds [95% CI 80 to 98 seconds]) compared with participants without the cell telephone aid. CONCLUSION: A simple audio program that can be made available for cell telephones increases the quality of bystander CPR in a manikin simulation.",M2
20196300,"Text messaging during simulated driving.OBJECTIVE: This research aims to identify the impact of text messaging on simulated driving performance. BACKGROUND: In the past decade, a number of on-road, epidemiological, and simulator-based studies reported the negative impact of talking on a <e>cell</e> phone on driving behavior. However, the impact of text messaging on simulated driving performance is still not fully understood. METHOD: Forty participants engaged in both a single task (driving) and a dual task (driving and text messaging) in a high-fidelity driving simulator. RESULTS: Analysis of driving performance revealed that participants in the dual-task condition responded more slowly to the onset of braking lights and showed impairments in forward and lateral control compared with a driving-only condition. Moreover, text-messaging drivers were involved in more crashes than drivers not engaged in text messaging. CONCLUSION: Text messaging while driving has a negative impact on simulated driving performance. This negative impact appears to exceed the impact of conversing on a cell phone while driving. APPLICATION: The results increase our understanding of driver distraction and have potential implications for public safety and device development.",M2
20185663,"Development of a staff recall system for mass casualty incidents using <e>cell</e> phone text messaging.BACKGROUND: After a mass casualty incident (MCI), rapid mobilization of hospital personnel is required because of an expected surge of victims. Risk assessment of our department's manual phone tree recall system revealed multiple weaknesses that would limit an effective response. Because cell phone use is widespread within the department, we developed and tested a staff recall system, based in our anesthesia information management system (AIMS), using Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging. METHODS: We sent test text messages to anesthesia staff members' cell phone numbers, determined the distance from their home to the hospital, and stored this information in our AIMS. Latency testing for the time from transmission of SMS test messages from the server to return of an e-mail reply was determined at 2 different times on 2 different dates, 1 of which was a busy holiday weekend, using volunteers within the department. Two unannounced simulated disaster recall drills were conducted, with text messages sent asking for the anticipated time to return to the hospital. A timeline of available staff on site was determined. Reasons for failure to respond to the disaster notification message were tabulated. RESULTS: Latency data were fit by a log-normal distribution with an average of 82 seconds from message transmission to e-mail reply. Replies to the simulated disaster alert were received from approximately 50% of staff, with 16 projecting that they would have been able to be back at the hospital within 30 minutes on both dates. There would have been 21 and 23 staff in-house at 30 minutes, and 32 and 37 staff in-house at 60 minutes on the first and second test date, respectively, including in-house staff. Of the nonresponders to the alert, 48% indicated that their cell phone was not with them or was turned off, whereas 22% missed the message. CONCLUSIONS: Our SMS staff recall system is likely to be able to rapidly mobilize sufficient numbers of anesthesia personnel in response to an MCI, but actual performance cannot be predicted with confidence. Using our AIMS as the source for contact information and from which to send messages was simple, inexpensive, and easy to implement. Updating contact information, periodic testing, and analysis of responses to simulated disaster alerts are essential for the effective functioning of such a system. However, maintenance of alternative methods of communication is recommended, because there may be more significant message transmission delays and failures during an actual MCI, and not all staff will receive the text message in a timely fashion.",M2
20159083,"Pedestrians, vehicles, and <e>cell</e> phones.With cellular phones and portable music players becoming a staple in everyday life, questions have arisen regarding the attentional deficits that might occur when such devices are used while performing other tasks. Here, we used a street-crossing task in an immersive virtual environment to test how this sort of divided attention affects pedestrian behavior when crossing a busy street. Thirty-six participants navigated through a series of unsigned intersections by walking on a manual treadmill in a virtual environment. While crossing, participants were undistracted, engaged in a hands free cell phone conversation, or listening to music on an iPod. Pedestrians were less likely to successfully cross the road when conversing on a cell phone than when listening to music, even though they took more time to initiate their crossing when conversing on a cell phone ( approximately 1.5s). This success rate difference was driven largely by failures to cross the road in the allotted trial time period (30s), suggesting that when conversing on a cell phone pedestrians are less likely to recognize and act on crossing opportunities.",M2
20150409,"Language and social factors in the use of <e>cell</e> phone technology by adolescents with and without specific language impairment (SLI).PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare cell phone use (both oral and text-based) by adolescents with and without specific language impairment (SLI) and examine the extent to which language and social factors affect frequency of use. METHOD: Both interview and diary methods were used to compare oral and text-based communication using cell phones by 17-year-olds: 52 adolescents with SLI and 52 typically developing (TD) peers. RESULTS: Overall, adolescents with SLI are motivated users of mobile technology, and they engage with both oral uses (phoning) and text-based uses (text messaging). However, adolescents with SLI do not exchange text messages as often as their TD peers. Social rather than language factors are associated with frequency of cell phone use in adolescence. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that social difficulties restrict text-based uses of cell phones by adolescents with SLI, which can in turn reduce the opportunities that these adolescents have to develop social networks and make arrangements to engage in peer social interaction.",M2

Despite the extensive use of mobile phones, little is known about the pattern of mobile phone ownership and its use by the general population and students. The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of ownership and use of mobile phones in medical science students and their views about any possible negative effects. The current cross-sectional study was conducted on 309 selected Medical Science students who were selected from Yazd Medical Sciences University using a self administrated questionnaire. The mean talking time and listening to music on the mobile phone was 28.3 +/- 50.5 and 51.9 +/- 81.5 min day(-1), respectively. They also received or sent a mean of 18.8 +/- 37 text messages. Participants reported that location wise, the use of <e>cell</e> phones at home was 87.2% followed by street (79.6%), classroom (37.6%), during driving (18.6%) and in the library (17.8%), respectively.

20118036,"Measures of physical activity using <e>cell</e> phones: validation using criterion methods.BACKGROUND: Physical activity is associated with reduced risks of many chronic diseases. Data collected on physical activity in large epidemiological studies is often based on paper questionnaires. The validity of these questionnaires is debated, and more effective methods are needed. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates repeated measures of physical activity level (PAL) and the feasibility of using a Java-based questionnaire downloaded onto cell phones for collection of such data. The data obtained were compared with reference estimates based on the doubly labeled water method and indirect calorimetry (PAL(ref)). METHOD: Using a Java-based cell phone application, 22 women reported their physical activity based on two short questions answered daily over a 14-day period (PAL(cell)). Results were compared with reference data obtained from the doubly labeled water method and indirect calorimetry (PAL(ref)). Results were also compared against physical activity levels assessed by two regular paper questionnaires completed by women at the end of the 14-day period (PAL(quest1) and PAL(quest2)). PAL(cell), PAL(quest1), and PAL(quest2) were compared with PAL(ref) using the Bland and Altman procedure. RESULTS: The mean difference between PAL(cell) and PAL(ref) was small (0.014) with narrow limits of agreement (2SD = 0.30). Compared with PAL(ref), the mean difference was also small for PAL(quest1) and PAL(quest2) (0.004 and 0.07, respectively); however, the limits of agreement were wider (PAL(quest1), 2SD = 0.50 and PAL(quest2), 2SD = 0.90). The test for trend was statistically significant for PAL(quest1) (slope of regression line = 0.79, P = .04) as well as for PAL(quest2) (slope of regression line = 1.58, P &lt; .001) when compared with PAL(ref). CONCLUSION: A Java-based physical activity questionnaire administered daily using cell phones produced PAL estimates that agreed well with PAL reference values. Furthermore, the limits of agreement between PAL obtained using cell phones, and reference values were narrower than for corresponding estimates obtained using paper questionnaires. Java-based questionnaires downloaded onto cell phones may be a feasible and cost-effective method of data collection for large-scale prospective studies of physical activity.",M2

There can be large differences between the expectations of patients and the perspective of their providers. The rationale for providing accessibility has historical roots and relates to the very basis of the physician-patient relationship and the effects on patient outcomes. While patients may want this line of communication, physicians may worry about disruption from unexpected phone calls, being requested to provide advice without access to records and providing services without adequate remuneration among other concerns. Herein, we discuss the rationale for these concerns, and provide suggestions on how we might overcome them. We suggest a framework with guidelines on establishing and maintaining remote accessibility with patients in the context of a productive physician-patient relationship.",M2
20087192,"Prenatal exposure to <e>cell</e> phone use and neurodevelopment at 14 months.BACKGROUND: Recently, an association was reported between prenatal and postnatal exposure to cell phones and neurobehavioral problems in children at the age of 7 years. METHODS: A birth cohort was established in Sabadell, Spain between 2004 and 2006. Mothers completed questions about cell phone use in week 32 of the pregnancy (n = 587). Neurodevelopment of their children was tested at age 14 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (n = 530). RESULTS: We observed only small differences in neurodevelopment scores between the offspring of cell phone users and nonusers. Those of users had higher mental development scores and lower psychomotor development scores, which may be due to unmeasured confounding. There was no trend with amount of cell phone use within users. CONCLUSION: This study gives little evidence for an adverse effect of maternal cell phone use during pregnancy on the early neurodevelopment of offspring.",M2

METHODS: The process included construction of a conceptual framework, generation of initial items, verification of content validity, selection of secondary items, preliminary study, and extraction of final items. The participants were 577 adolescents in two middle schools and three high schools. Item analysis, factor analysis, criterion related validity, and internal consistency were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Twenty items were selected for the final scale, and categorized into 3 factors explaining 55.45% of total variance. The factors were labeled as withdrawal/tolerance (7 items), life dysfunction (6 items), and compulsion/persistence (7 items). The scores for the scale were significantly correlated with self-control, impulsiveness, and cell phone use. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the 20 items was .92. Scale scores identified students as cell phone addicted, heavy users, or average users.

20054860,"<e>Cell</e> phone intervention to improve adherence: cystic fibrosis care team, patient, and parent perspectives.BACKGROUND: Treatment regimens for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are time-consuming and complex, resulting in consistently low adherence rates. To date, few studies have evaluated innovative technologies to improve adherence in this population. Current infection control guidelines for patients with CF seek to minimize patient-to-patient transmission of potential pathogens. Thus, interventions must avoid face-to-face contact and be delivered individually, limiting opportunities for peer support. This study aimed to develop and assess a web-enabled cell phone, CFFONE, designed to provide CF information and social support to improve adherence in adolescents with CF. METHODS: The acceptability, feasibility, and utility of CFFONE were evaluated with health care professionals (n = 17) adolescents with CF aged 11-18 years old (n = 12), adults with CF aged 21-36 years old (n = 6), parents of adolescents with CF (n = 12), and technology experts (n = 8). Adolescents also tested a prototype of CFFONE (n = 9). Qualitative and quantitative data were collected. RESULTS: Focus group data with health care professionals indicated a need for this intervention, and indicated that CFFONE would be likely to improve knowledge and social support, and somewhat likely to improve adherence. Adolescent, adults, and parents all rated CFFONE as likely to improve adherence. Technology experts rated the prototype design and format as appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provided some support from key stakeholders for this intervention to improve adherence in adolescents with CF. Next steps include a multi-center trial of the efficacy and safety of CFFONE.",M2
20053101,"Faces and text attract gaze independent of the task: Experimental data and computer model.Previous studies of eye gaze have shown that when looking at images containing human faces, observers tend to rapidly focus on the facial regions. But is this true of other high-level image features as well? We here investigate the extent to which natural scenes containing faces, text elements, and <e>cell</e> phones-as a suitable control-attract attention by tracking the eye movements of subjects in two types of tasks-free viewing and search. We observed that subjects in free-viewing conditions look at faces and text 16.6 and 11.1 times more than similar regions normalized for size and position of the face and text. In terms of attracting gaze, text is almost as effective as faces. Furthermore, it is difficult to avoid looking at faces and text even when doing so imposes a cost. We also found that subjects took longer in making their initial saccade when they were told to avoid faces/text and their saccades landed on a non-face/non-text object. We refine a well-known bottom-up computer model of saliency-driven attention that includes conspicuity maps for color, orientation, and intensity by adding high-level semantic information (i.e., the location of faces or text) and demonstrate that this significantly improves the ability to predict eye fixations in natural images. Our enhanced model's predictions yield an area under the ROC curve over 84% for images that contain faces or text when compared against the actual fixation pattern of subjects. This suggests that the primate visual system allocates attention using such an enhanced saliency map.",M2

The mRNA levels of four proteins that are usually up regulated when an injury has occurred were investigated; included were Calcium ATP-ase, Endothelin, Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule, and Neural Growth Factor. These isolated mRNAs were subjected to RT-PCR and all four were up regulated. The mandibular nerve showed a higher and broader level of up regulation than the buccal nerve. All four mRNA up regulations for the mandibular nerve and two for the buccal nerve were also statistically significant. These specific injury-related findings were mild. As the use of these cell phones continues, there most likely will be permanent damage to these tissues over the years and the likelihood of tumors, cancers, and system failures will potentially increase.",M2

19964449,"Predicting cardiovascular disease from real-time electrocardiographic monitoring: An adaptive machine learning approach on a <e>cell</e> phone.To date, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of global death. The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most widely adopted clinical tool that measures the electrical activities of the heart from the body surface. However, heart rhythm irregularities cannot always be detected on a standard resting ECG machine, since they may not occur during an individual's recording session. Common Holter-based portable solutions that record ECG for up to 24 to 48 hours lack the capability to provide real-time feedback. In this research, we seek to establish a cell phone-based real-time monitoring technology for CVD, capable of performing continuous on-line ECG processing, generating a personalized cardiac health summary report in layman's language, automatically detecting and classifying abnormal CVD conditions, all in real time. Specifically, we developed an adaptive artificial neural network (ANN)-based machine learning technique, combining both an individual's cardiac characteristics and information from clinical ECG databases, to train the cell phone to learn to adapt to its user's physiological conditions to achieve better ECG feature extraction and more accurate CVD classification on cell phones.",M2

19902705,"Effects of a <e>cell</e> phone conversation on cognitive processing performances.BACKGROUND: The ability to apportion cognitive resources to process multiple visual and auditory stimuli is essential for human communication in competing conditions. PURPOSE: The purpose of the current research was to examine the effects of a cell phone conversation on a battery of cognitive tests, using both timing (RT) and accuracy (A') as dependent measures. RESEARCH DESIGN: A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted. STUDY SAMPLE: Forty-two college-age (mean 22 yr) adult females with normal hearing and cognitive function participated in the study. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In one condition (quiet), a standardized cognitive assessment battery was administered to participants in a quiet room. In the (cell phone) condition, subjects were formulating and responding to specific questions about their travel experiences during administration of the same cognitive assessment battery. The computer automatically records subject performance. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted using the Bonferroni approach. The alpha level was set at .05 for all data analysis. This method of analysis was repeated for each of the dependent measures, RT, and A'. RESULTS: The results revealed a consistent, significant effect on reaction time between the two conditions. The same analysis was also conducted to examine the effect of participation in a cell phone discussion on accuracy. As with RT, results revealed a consistent, significant affect on A' between the two conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the notion that there are differential effects of auditory distracters across cognitive spheres. For simple automatic type visual cognitive tasks, the effect is minimal. However, as visual tasks increase in difficulty, the effect of the auditory distraction is magnified, particularly when the task requires extensive division of language resources.",M2
19899366,"The effects of text messaging on young drivers.OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of using a <e>cell</e> phone to retrieve and send text messages on the driving performance of young novice drivers. BACKGROUND: Young drivers are particularly susceptible to driver distraction and have an increased risk of distraction-related crashes. Distractions from in-vehicle devices, particularly, those that require manual input, are known to cause decrements in driving performance. METHOD: Twenty young novice drivers used a cell phone to retrieve and send text messages while driving a simulator. RESULTS: The amount of time that drivers spent not looking at the road when text messaging was up to approximately 400% greater than that recorded in baseline (notext-messaging) conditions. Furthermore, drivers' variability in lane position increased up to approximately 50%, and missed lane changes increased 140%. There was also an increase of up to approximately 150% in drivers' variability in following distances to lead vehicles. CONCLUSION: Previous research has shown that the risk of crashing while dialing a handheld device, such as when text messaging and driving, is more than double that of conversing on a cell phone. The present study has identified the detrimental effects of text messaging on driving performance that may underlie such increased crash risk. APPLICATION: More effective road safety measures are needed to prevent and mitigate the adverse effects on driving performance of using cell phones to retrieve and send text messages.",M2

However, the cellular target of RF-EMW is still controversial. This review identifies the plasma membrane as a target of RF-EMW. In addition, the effects of RF-EMW on plasma membrane structures (i.e. NADH oxidase, phosphatidylserine, ornithine decarboxylase) and voltage-gated calcium channels are discussed. We explore the disturbance in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism caused by RF-EMW and delineate NADH oxidase mediated ROS formation as playing a central role in oxidative stress (OS) due to cell phone radiation (with a focus on the male reproductive system). This review also addresses: 1) the controversial effects of RF-EMW on mammalian cells and sperm DNA as well as its effect on apoptosis, 2) epidemiological, in vivo animal and in vitro studies on the effect of RF-EMW on male reproductive system, and 3) finally, exposure assessment and dosimetry by computational biomodeling.",M2
19848576,"Computerized Automated Reminder Diabetes System (CARDS): e-mail and SMS <e>cell</e> phone text messaging reminders to support diabetes management.BACKGROUND: Cell phone text messaging, via the Short Messaging Service (SMS), offers the promise of a highly portable, well-accepted, and inexpensive modality for engaging youth and young adults in the management of their diabetes. This pilot and feasibility study compared two-way SMS cell phone messaging with e-mail reminders that were directed at encouraging blood glucose (BG) monitoring. METHODS: Forty insulin-treated adolescents and young adults with diabetes were randomized to receive electronic reminders to check their BG levels via cell phone text messaging or e-mail reminders for a 3-month pilot study. Electronic messages were automatically generated, and participant replies with BG results were processed by the locally developed Computerized Automated Reminder Diabetes System (CARDS). Participants set their schedule for reminders on the secure CARDS website where they could also enter and review BG data. RESULTS: Of the 40 participants, 22 were randomized to receive cell phone text message reminders and 18 to receive e-mail reminders; 18 in the cell phone group and 11 in the e-mail group used the system. Compared to the e-mail group, users in the cell phone group received more reminders (180.4 vs. 106.6 per user) and responded with BG results significantly more often (30.0 vs. 6.9 per user, P = 0.04). During the first month cell phone users submitted twice as many BGs as e-mail users (27.2 vs. 13.8 per user); by month 3, usage waned. CONCLUSIONS: Cell phone text messaging to promote BG monitoring is a viable and acceptable option in adolescents and young adults with diabetes. However, maintaining interest levels for prolonged intervals remains a challenge.",M2
19844092,"Simultaneous ring voice-over-Internet phone system enables rapid physician elicitation of explicit informed consent in prehospital stroke treatment trials.BACKGROUND: Cellular phone conversations between on-scene patients or their legally authorized representatives (LARs) and off-scene enrolling physician-investigators require immediate and reliable connection systems to obtain explicit informed research consent in prehospital treatment trials. METHODS: The NIH Field Administration of Stroke Therapy-Magnesium (FAST-MAG) Trial implemented a voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) simultaneous ring system (multiple investigator <e>cell</e> phones called simultaneously and first responder connected to call) to enable physician-investigators to elicit consent immediately from competent patients or LARs encountered by 228 ambulances enrolling patients in a multicenter prehospital stroke trial. For 1 month, the number, origin, duration, and yield of enrolling line calls were monitored prospectively. RESULTS: Six investigators were connected to 106 enrolling line calls, with no identified unanswered calls. Thirty-five percent of new patient calls yielded an enrollment. The most common reasons for non-enrollment were last known well &gt;2 h (n = 7) and unconsentable patient without LAR available (n = 7). No non-enrollments were directly attributable to the VOIP system. In enrollments, consent was provided by the patient in 67% and a LAR in 33%. The duration of enrollment calls (mean +/- SD: 8.4 +/- 2.5 min, range 6-14) was longer than non-enrollment calls (5.5 +/- 3.5, range 2-13; p &lt; 0.001). The median interval from last known well to study agent start was 46 min, and 70% were enrolled within 60 min of onset. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous ring system was reliable and effective, permitting enrollment of a substantial number of patients within the first hour after stroke onset. VOIP cellular networks with simultaneous ring are a preferred means of facilitating consent in prehospital treatment trials.",M2

The objective of this article is to present the results of a study on the impact of appointment reminders sent as short message service text messages to patients' cell phones on nonattendance rates at outpatient clinics in São Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN: Data were collected on scheduled appointments in four medical clinics using Clinic Manager or Clinic Web systems that can send automated messages to patients. Data on appointment attendance were collected from these systems. MEASUREMENTS: More than 29,000 appointments were scheduled between July 1, 2007, and May 31, 2008, and for 7890 of them a text message reminder was sent to the patient's cell phone. The rates of nonattendance were compared between those who were sent and those who were not sent a text message as an appointment reminder. RESULTS: The nonattendance reduction rates for appointments at the four outpatient clinics studied were 0.82% (p= .590), 3.55% (p= .009), 5.75% (p= .022), and 14.49% (p= &lt; .001).

METHODS AND DESIGN: A multi-site randomized controlled open-label trial. A central randomization centre provided opaque envelopes to allocate treatments. Patients initiating ART at three comprehensive care clinics in Kenya will be randomized to receive either a structured weekly SMS ('short message system' or text message) slogan (the intervention) or current standard of care support mechanisms alone (the control). Our hypothesis is that using a structured mobile phone protocol to keep in touch with patients will improve adherence to ART and other patient outcomes. Participants are evaluated at baseline, and then at six and twelve months after initiating ART. The care providers keep a weekly study log of all phone based communications with study participants. Primary outcomes are self-reported adherence to ART and suppression of HIV viral load at twelve months scheduled follow-up. Secondary outcomes are improvements in health, quality of life, social and economic factors, and retention on ART. Primary analysis is by 'intention-to-treat'. Sensitivity analysis will be used to assess per-protocol effects. Analysis of covariates will be undertaken to determine factors that contribute or deter from expected and determined outcomes. DISCUSSION: This study protocol tests whether a novel structured mobile phone intervention can positively contribute to ART management in a resource-limited setting.",M2

METHODS: Participants who completed a two-week run-in were randomly assigned to either MOBILE-Coached (n = 9) or MOBILE-Self-Monitored (n = 8). All participants met with a nurse to develop an individualized exercise plan, were issued a pedometer and exercise booklet, and instructed to continue to log their daily exercise and symptoms. MOBILE-Coached also received weekly reinforcement text messages on their cell phones; reports of worsening symptoms were automatically flagged for follow-up. Usability and satisfaction were assessed. Participants completed incremental cycle and six minute walk (6MW) tests, wore an activity monitor for 14 days, and reported their health-related quality of life (HRQL) at baseline, three, and six months. RESULTS: The sample had a mean age of 68 +/-11 and forced expiratory volume in one second 18% predicted. Participants reported that logging their exercise and symptoms (FEV(1)) of 40 +/- was easy and that keeping track of their exercise helped them remain active. There were no differences between groups over time in maximal workload, 6MW distance, or HRQL (p &gt; 0.05); however, MOBILE-Self-Monitored increased total steps/day whereas MOBILE-Coached logged fewer steps over six months (p =0.04). CONCLUSIONS: We showed that it is feasible to deliver a cell phone-based exercise persistence intervention to patients with COPD post-rehabilitation and that the addition of coaching appeared to be no better than self-monitoring. The latter finding needs to be interpreted with caution since this was a purely exploratory study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00373932).",M2

The human factor appears in the literature as the most prevalent contributing factor of road traffic crashes. The purpose of the study was to utilize components of the Health Belief Model to predict risky driving behaviors among a sample of commuters in Yazd, Iran. METHODS: A cross-sectional, correlational design was employed. A two-stage cluster sampling was used to recruit 300 drivers to participate in the study. RESULTS: The most reported risky driving behavior was speaking with others and using a <e>cell</e> phone, both while driving. There was a negative statistically significant association between risky driving behaviors and age. The occurrence of risky driving behaviors was higher among males as well as single drivers and was inversely related to education level. There was also a positive statistically significant correlation between risky driving behaviors and road traffic accidents and the number of traffic citations/fines. Perceived severity, susceptibility, barriers, threat, and net benefits were significantly related to risky driving behaviors. CONCLUSION: The pattern of risky driving behaviors, and safe driving barriers among commuters in Yazd, Iran, which are identified in this study, could be used in planning effective intervention programs to improve the driving habits of the commuters. The results of the study showed that Health Belief Model can be used as a conceptual framework for intervention programs aimed at decreasing road traffic accidents.",M2

19682728,"Mobile phone radiation inhibits Vigna radiata (mung bean) root growth by inducing oxidative stress.During the last couple of decades, there has been a tremendous increase in the use of <e>cell</e> phones. It has significantly added to the rapidly increasing EMF smog, an unprecedented type of pollution consisting of radiation in the environment, thereby prompting the scientists to study the effects on humans. However, not many studies have been conducted to explore the effects of cell phone EMFr on growth and biochemical changes in plants. We investigated whether EMFr from cell phones inhibit growth of Vigna radiata (mung bean) through induction of conventional stress responses. Effects of cell phone EMFr (power density: 8.55 microW cm(-2); 900 MHz band width; for 1/2, 1, 2, and 4 h) were determined by measuring the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in terms of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) content, root oxidizability and changes in levels of antioxidant enzymes. Our results showed that cell phone EMFr significantly inhibited the germination (at &gt; or =2 h), and radicle and plumule growths (&gt; or =1 h) in mung bean in a time-dependent manner. Further, cell phone EMFr enhanced MDA content (indicating lipid peroxidation), and increased H(2)O(2) accumulation and root oxidizability in mung bean roots, thereby inducing oxidative stress and cellular damage. In response to EMFr, there was a significant upregulation in the activities of scavenging enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases, ascorbate peroxidases, guaiacol peroxidases, catalases and glutathione reductases, in mung bean roots. The study concluded that cell phone EMFr inhibit root growth of mung bean by inducing ROS-generated oxidative stress despite increased activities of antioxidant enzymes.",M2

19653488,"An investigation of driver distraction near the tipping point of traffic flow stability.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the interrelationship between driver distraction and characteristics of driver behavior associated with reduced highway traffic efficiency. BACKGROUND: Research on the three-phase traffic theory and on behavioral driving suggests that a number of characteristics associated with efficient traffic flow may be affected by driver distraction. Previous studies have been limited, however, by the fact that researchers typically do not allow participants to change lanes, nor do they account for the impact of varying traffic states on driving performance. METHODS: Participants drove in three simulated environments with differing traffic congestion while both using and not using a <e>cell</e> phone. Instructed only to obey the speed limit, participants were allowed to vary driving behaviors, such as those involving forward following distance, speed, and lane-changing frequency. RESULTS: Both driver distraction and traffic congestion were found to significantly affect lane change frequency, mean speed, and the likelihood of remaining behind a slower-moving lead vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests that the behavioral profile of  cell phone drivers,  which is often described as compensatory, may have far-reaching and unexpected consequences for traffic efficiency. APPLICATION: By considering the dynamic interplay between characteristics of traffic flow and driver behavior, this research may inform both public policy regarding in-vehicle cell phone use and future investigations of driving behavior.",M2
19650078,"1950 MHz IMT-2000 field does not activate microglial <e>cells</e> in vitro.Given the widespread use of the cellular phone today, investigation of potential biological effects of radiofrequency (RF) fields has become increasingly important. In particular, much research has been conducted on RF effects on brain function. To examine any biological effects on the central nervous system (CNS) induced by 1950 MHz modulation signals, which are controlled by the International Mobile Telecommunication-2000 (IMT-2000) cellular system, we investigated the effect of RF fields on microglial cells in the brain. We assessed functional changes in microglial cells by examining changes in immune reaction-related molecule expression and cytokine production after exposure to a 1950 MHz Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) RF field, at specific absorption rates (SARs) of 0.2, 0.8, and 2.0 W/kg. Primary microglial cell cultures prepared from neonatal rats were subjected to an RF or sham field for 2 h. Assay samples obtained 24 and 72 h after exposure were processed in a blind manner. Results showed that the percentage of cells positive for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, which is the most common marker for activated microglial cells, was similar between cells exposed to W-CDMA radiation and sham-exposed controls. No statistically significant differences were observed between any of the RF field exposure groups and the sham-exposed controls in percentage of MHC class II positive cells. Further, no remarkable differences in the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were observed between the test groups exposed to W-CDMA signal and the sham-exposed negative controls. These findings suggest that exposure to RF fields up to 2 W/kg does not activate microglial cells in vitro.",M2
19649291,"Mobile phone radiation induces reactive oxygen species production and DNA damage in human spermatozoa in vitro.BACKGROUND: In recent times there has been some controversy over the impact of electromagnetic radiation on human health. The significance of mobile phone radiation on male reproduction is a key element of this debate since several studies have suggested a relationship between mobile phone use and semen quality. The potential mechanisms involved have not been established, however, human spermatozoa are known to be particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress by virtue of the abundant availability of substrates for free radical attack and the lack of cytoplasmic space to accommodate antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, the induction of oxidative stress in these <e>cells</e> not only perturbs their capacity for fertilization but also contributes to sperm DNA damage. The latter has, in turn, been linked with poor fertility, an increased incidence of miscarriage and morbidity in the offspring, including childhood cancer. In light of these associations, we have analyzed the influence of RF-EMR on the cell biology of human spermatozoa in vitro. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Purified human spermatozoa were exposed to radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) tuned to 1.8 GHz and covering a range of specific absorption rates (SAR) from 0.4 W/kg to 27.5 W/kg. In step with increasing SAR, motility and vitality were significantly reduced after RF-EMR exposure, while the mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species and DNA fragmentation were significantly elevated (P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, we also observed highly significant relationships between SAR, the oxidative DNA damage bio-marker, 8-OH-dG, and DNA fragmentation after RF-EMR exposure. CONCLUSIONS: RF-EMR in both the power density and frequency range of mobile phones enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation by human spermatozoa, decreasing the motility and vitality of these cells while stimulating DNA base adduct formation and, ultimately DNA fragmentation. These findings have clear implications for the safety of extensive mobile phone use by males of reproductive age, potentially affecting both their fertility and the health and wellbeing of their offspring.",M2

Simultaneously, adolescents can communicate with parents to inform them of activities and to solicit support or they can also choose to nondisclose. The frequency, duration, and nature of calls may relate to parents' and to adolescents' perceptions of truthfulness and family relationships. 196 dyads (13% father-son, 11% father-daughter, 30% mother-son, and 46% mother-daughter) completed a questionnaire indicating cell phone use, their truthfulness of activities, the nature of their calls to one another, and family relationships. The parents were, on average, 45.38 years old (SD = 6.35) and were 83% Euroamerican, 9% Asian American, 3% Latino, 3% African American, 2% Mixed ethnicity, and 1% American Indian. The adolescents were, on average, 16.25 years old (SD = 1.17) and were 77% Euroamerican, 9% Asian American, 4% Latino, 3% African American, 8% Mixed ethnicity, and .5% American Indian. Correlational analyses revealed that parents who called more frequently reported less truthfulness when speaking to their adolescents via cell phone. Greater frequency in parental calls also was associated with less adolescent-reported truthfulness. From multiple regression analyses, for parents, calls when upset were associated with less parental knowledge and poorer family relations. For adolescents, the same was true; however, adolescents who made calls seeking social support and to ask and confer with parents reported greater perceived parental knowledge and better family relationships.",M2

BACKGROUND: Tactile and auditory collision warnings have been shown to improve braking response time (RT) in rear-end collision situations. However, it is not clear how effective these warnings are when the driver is engaged in attentionally demanding secondary tasks, such as talking on a cell phone. METHOD: Sixteen participants in a driving simulator experienced three collision warning conditions (none, tactile, and auditory) in three conversation conditions (none, simple hands free, complex hands free). Driver RT was captured from warning onset to brake initiation (WON2B). RESULTS: WON2B times for auditory warnings were significantly larger for simple conversations compared with no conversation (+148 ms), whereas there was no significant difference between these conditions for tactile warnings (+53 ms). For complex conversations, WON2B times for both tactile (+146 ms) and auditory warnings (+221 ms) were significantly larger than during no conversation. During complex conversations, tactile warnings produced significantly shorter WON2B times than no warning (-141 ms). CONCLUSION: Tactile warnings are more effective than auditory warnings during both simple and complex conversations. APPLICATION: These results indicate that tactile rear-end collision warnings have the potential to offset some of the driving impairments caused by cell phone conversations.",M2

Through the use of wireless, cellular communication, an overall improvement in communication accuracy and efficiency between intraoperative orthopaedic surgeons and floor nurses may be achieved. METHODS: Both communication types occurred while the surgeon was scrubbed in the operating room (OR). Indirect communication occurred when the pager call was answered by the OR circulating nurse with communication between the surgeon, circulating nurse, and floor nurse. Direct communication consisted of <e>cell</e> phone and Jabra Bluetooth BT200 wireless ear piece used by the surgeon. The surgeon answered the floor nurse's cellular call by phone ring-activated automatic answering. The study was conducted during scheduled orthopaedic procedures. An independent observer measured time variables with a stop-watch while orthopaedic nurses randomly called via pager or cell phone. The nurses asked for patient caregiver confirmation and answers to 30 different patient-care questions. RESULTS: Sixty trials were performed with 30 cell and 30 page communications. Direct cellular communication showed a better response rate than indirect page (Cell 100%, Page 73%). Indirect page communication allowed a 27% and 33% error rate with patient problem and surgeon solution communications, respectively. There were no reported communication errors while using direct wireless, cellular communication. When compared to page communications, cellular communications showed statistically significant improvements in mean time intervals in response time (Cell = 11s, Page = 211s), correct patient identification (Cell = 5s, Page = 172s), patient problem and solution time (Cell = 13s, Page = 189s), and total communication time (Cell = 32s, Page = 250s) (s = seconds, all P &lt; 0.001). Floor nurse satisfaction ratings (dependent on communication times and/or difficulties) were improved with direct cellular communication (Cell = 29 excellent, Page = 11 excellent). Intraoperative case interruptions (defined as delaying surgical progress) were more frequent with indirect page communication (10 page v. 0 cell). CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrates that direct wireless communication may be used to improve intraoperative communication and enhance patient safety. Direct wireless, cellular intraoperative communication improves communication times, communication accuracy, communication satisfaction, and minimizes intraoperative case interruption. As a result of this study, we hope to maintain our transition to direct wireless, cellular intraoperative orthopaedic communication to reduce medical errors, improve patient care, and enhance both orthopaedic surgeon and nursing efficiencies.",M2

19492235,"900-MHz microwave radiation enhances gamma-ray adverse effects on SHG44 <e>cells</e>.Mobile phones are widely used globally. However, the biological effects due to exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) produced by mobile phones are largely unknown. Environmental and occupational exposure of humans to gamma-rays is a biologically relevant phenomenon. Consequently studies were undertaken to examine the interactions between gamma-rays and EMF on human health. In this study, exposure to 900-MHz EMF expanded gamma-ray damage to SHG44 cells. Preexposure EMF enhanced the decrease in cell proliferation induced by gamma-ray irradiation and the rate of apoptosis. The combination of EMF and gamma-ray exposure resulted in a synergistic effect by triggering stress response, which increased reactive oxygen species, but the expression of hsp70 at both mRNA and protein levels remained unaltered. Data indicate that the adverse effects of gamma-rays on cellular functions are strengthened by EMF.",M2

For this purpose the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by flow cytometry in human lymphoblastoid cells exposed to 1950 MHz signal used by the third generation wireless technology of the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) at Specific Absorption Rate of 0.5 and 2.0 W/kg. Short (5-60 min) or long (24 h) duration exposures were carried out in a waveguide system under strictly controlled conditions of both dosimetry and environment. Cell viability was also measured after 24 h RF exposure using the Resazurin and Neutral Red assays. Several co-exposure protocols were applied to test if RF radiation is able to alter ROS formation induced by FeSO(4) (RF given before or concurrently to FeSO(4)). The results obtained indicate that non-thermal RF exposures do not increase spontaneous ROS formation in any of the experimental conditions investigated. Consistent with the lack of ROS production, no change in cell viability was observed in Jurkat cells exposed to RF radiation for 24 h. Similar results were obtained when co-exposures were considered: combined exposures to RF radiation and FeSO(4) did not increase ROS formation induced by the chemical treatment alone. In contrast, in cultures treated with FeSO(4) as positive control, a dose-dependent increase in ROS formation was recorded, validating the sensitivity of the method employed.",M2

A few studies related to hippocampal exposure are available, which indicate the impact of RF field in some parameters. The present study investigated the effect of exposure to mobile phone on developing hippocampus. Male and female Swiss albino mice were housed as control and mobile phone exposed groups. The pregnant animals in tested group were exposed to the effects of mobile phone in a room possessing the exposure system. The left hemispheres of the brains were processed by frozen microtome. The sections obtained were stained with Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin. For cell counting by the optical fractionator method, a pilot study was first performed. Hippocampal areas were analyzed using Axiovision software running on a personal computer. The optical dissector, systematically and randomly spaced, was focused to the widest profile of the pyramidal cell nucleus. No significant difference in pyramidal cell number of total Cornu Ammonis (CA) sectors of hippocampus was found between the control and the mobile phone exposed groups (p &gt; .05).

19440939,"Effects of exposure to DAMPS and GSM signals on ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity: II. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma <e>cells</e>.PURPOSE: An increase in Ornithine Decarboxylase (ODC) activity was reported in L929 murine fibroblast cells after exposure to a digital cellular telephone signal. This result was not confirmed by several other studies, including the one reported in a companion paper. As a partner in the Perform-B programme, we extended this study to human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), using well-defined waveguide systems to imitate exposure to radiofrequency radiation (RFR): Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System (DAMPS) or Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) signals emitted by mobile phones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were exposed at various Specific Absorption Rates (SAR) to DAMPS or GSM signals using different set-ups. Cell ODC activities were assayed using 14CO2 generation from 14C-labeled L-ornithine. RESULTS: SH-SY5Y cells were incubated for 20 hours, and were blindly exposed to 50 Hz-modulated DAMPS-835 or 217 Hz-modulated GSM-1800 for 8 or 24 h using Information Technologies in Society (IT'IS) waveguides equipped with fans. After cell lysis, ODC activity was determined using 14C-labeled L-ornithine. ODC activity was estimated by the 14CO2 generated from 14C-labeled L-ornithine, as generated d.p.m. 14CO2/h/mg protein. The results showed that, irrespective of the signal used (835 MHz/DAMPS, or 1800 MHz/GSM) and exposure conditions (duration and SAR), human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells did not exhibit any alteration in ODC enzyme activity. CONCLUSION: This work did not show a significant effect of mobile phone RFR exposure on ODC activity in neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y).",M2

Confirmation of these data was undertaken, given the suggested potential physiopathological consequences, i.e., tumour promotion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Murine L-929 fibroblasts were exposed at various Specific Absorption rates (SAR) to (DAMPS) or Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) signals using different set-ups. <e>Cell</e> ODC activities were assayed using 14CO2 generation from 14C-labeled L-ornithine. RESULTS: ODC activity in live L-929 cells showed no significant alteration after exposure at an SAR of 2.5 W/kg, for one hour at the end of exposure to 50 Hz-modulated DAMPS-835 using Transverse Electro-Magnetic (TEM) cells. No significant alteration in ODC activity was observed at 6 W/kg, with active fans to regulate temperature (37 degrees C). Tests using cell lysed after exposure in another temperature-controlled set-up (waveguides) did not confirm the published studies reporting increased ODC activity in Radio-Frequency radiation (RFR)-exposed L-929 cells. In the second part of the study, no alteration of ODC activity was detected when L-929 cells were exposed to different RFR signals: 217 Hz modulated GSM-900 (wire-patch antenna) or GSM-1800 (waveguides), and lysed before ODC measurement. CONCLUSION: We conclude that under our exposure conditions, DAMPS-835 and GSM signals have no influence on ODC activity in L-929 cells.",M2

METHODS: The scientific literature exploring the effects of these two types of cell phone use on driving and driving-related performance is reviewed here. RESULTS: Our review shows that talking on the phone, regardless of phone type, has negative impacts on performance especially in detecting and identifying events. Performance while using a hands-free phone was rarely found to be better than when using a handheld phone. Some studies found that drivers compensate for the deleterious effects of cell phone use when using a handheld phone but neglect to do so when using a hands-free phone.

METHODS: One hundred seventy-nine valid articles were retrieved from PubMed and PsycINFO between 1996 and 2005 related to pathological Internet, cell phone, or video game use. RESULTS: The years with the highest numbers of articles published were 2004 (n = 42) and 2005 (n = 40). The most productive countries, in terms of number of articles published, were the United States (n = 52), China (n = 23), the United Kingdom (n = 17), Taiwan (n = 13), and South Korea (n = 9). The most commonly used language was English (65.4%), followed by Chinese (12.8%) and Spanish (4.5%). Articles were published in 96 different journals, of which 22 published 2 or more articles. The journal that published the most articles was Cyberpsychology &amp; Behavior (n = 41). Addiction to the Internet was the most intensely studied (85.3%), followed by addiction to video games (13.6%) and cell phones (2.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The number of publications in this area is growing, but it is difficult to conduct precise searches due to a lack of clear terminology. To facilitate retrieval, bibliographic databases should include descriptor terms referring specifically to Internet, video games, and cell phone addiction as well as to more general addictions involving communications and information technologies and other behavioral addictions.",M2
19393787,"Short-term effects of a teenage driver <e>cell</e> phone restriction.On December 1, 2006, North Carolina began prohibiting use of any mobile communication device by drivers younger than 18. The current study examined the effects of the law on teenage drivers' cell phone use. Teenage drivers were observed at high schools in North Carolina 1-2 months before and approximately 5 months after the law took effect. The proportion of teenagers using cell phones did not change significantly (11.0% before the law took effect, 11.8% after). Cell phone use among teenage drivers at high schools in South Carolina, an adjacent state without a teenage driver phone ban, was stable at about 13%. Interviews were conducted with parents and teenagers in North Carolina both before and after the law took effect. In post-law interviews, teenagers were more likely than parents to say they knew about the cell phone restriction (64% vs. 39%), but support for the ban was greater among parents (95% vs. 74%). Only 22% of teenagers and 13% of parents believed the law was being enforced fairly often or a lot. Although the proportion of teenagers who reported using phones while driving declined somewhat following the law, about half admitted they used their phones, if they had driven, on the day prior to the interview. Overall, the findings suggest that North Carolina's cell phone restriction had little to no effect on teenage drivers' use of cell phones shortly after the law took effect.",M2

Scientific literature was searched to identify controlled studies evaluating cell phone voice and text message interventions to provide care and disease management support. Searches identified 25 studies that evaluated cell phone voice and text messaging interventions, with 20 randomized controlled trials and 5 controlled studies. Nineteen studies assessed outcomes of care and six assessed processes of care. Selected studies included 38,060 participants with 10,374 adults and 27,686 children. They covered 12 clinical areas and took place in 13 countries. Frequency of message delivery ranged from 5 times per day for diabetes and smoking cessation support to once a week for advice on how to overcome barriers and maintain regular physical activity. Significant improvements were noted in compliance with medicine taking, asthma symptoms, HbA1C, stress levels, smoking quit rates, and self-efficacy. Process improvements were reported in lower failed appointments, quicker diagnosis and treatment, and improved teaching and training. Cost per text message was provided by two studies.

With the present randomized controlled study we intended to verify the effectiveness of VR in reducing anxiety in patients undergoing ambulatory operations under local or regional anaesthesia. In particular, we measured the degree to which anxiety associated with surgical intervention was reduced by distracting patients with immersive VR provided through a <e>cell</e> phone connected to an HMD compared to a no-distraction control condition. A significant reduction of anxiety was obtained after 45 minutes of operation in the VR group, but not in the control group and, after 90 minutes, the reduction was larger in the experimental group than in other one. In conclusion, this study presents an innovative promising technique to reduce anxiety during surgical interventions, even if more studies are necessary to investigate its effectiveness in other kinds of operations and in larger numbers of patients.",M2

V79 cells were cultured in standard laboratory conditions and exposed to continuous-wave (CW) RF/MW radiation of 935 MHz, electric field strength of (8.2+/-0.3) V m(-1), and specific absorption rate (SAR) of 0.12 W kg(-1). To identify proliferation kinetics, the cells were counted for each hour of exposure 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after respective exposures. Microtubule proteins were determined using specific immunocytochemical methods. Cell smears were analysed under a fluorescent microscope. The study included negative and positive controls. Mitotic index was determined by estimating the number of dividing cells 24 h after exposure and dividing it with the total number of cells. In comparison to the controls, cell proliferation declined in cells exposed for three hours 72 h after irradiation (p &lt; 0.05). Microtubule structure was clearly altered immediately after three hours of irradiation (p &lt; 0.05). The mitotic index in RF/MW-exposed cells did not differ from negative controls. However, even if exposure did not affect the number of dividing cells, it may have slowed down cell division kinetics as a consequence of microtubule impairment immediately after exposure.",M2

In the present review, the authors attempt to address the following question: is there epidemiologic evidence for an association between long-term cell phone usage and the risk of developing a brain tumor? Included with this meta-analysis of the long-term epidemiologic data are a brief overview of cell phone technology and discussion of laboratory data, biological mechanisms, and brain tumor incidence. METHODS: In order to be included in the present meta-analysis, studies were required to have met all of the following criteria: (i) publication in a peer-reviewed journal; (ii) inclusion of participants using cell phones for &gt; or = 10 years (ie, minimum 10-year  latency ); and (iii) incorporation of a  laterality  analysis of long-term users (ie, analysis of the side of the brain tumor relative to the side of the head preferred for cell phone usage). This is a meta-analysis incorporating all 11 long-term epidemiologic studies in this field. RESULTS: The results indicate that using a cell phone for &gt; or = 10 years approximately doubles the risk of being diagnosed with a brain tumor on the same ( ipsilateral ) side of the head as that preferred for cell phone use. The data achieve statistical significance for glioma and acoustic neuroma but not for meningioma.

19328527,"<e>Cell</e> phone use and acoustic neuroma: the need for standardized questionnaires and access to industry data.BACKGROUND: The capacity of radiofrequency from cell phones to be absorbed into the brain has prompted concerns that regular cell phone use may increase the risk of acoustic neuroma (AN) and other brain tumors. This article critically evaluates current literature on cell phone use and AN risks and proposes additional studies to clarify any possible linkage. METHODS: Through a PubMed search, we identified and reviewed 10 case-control studies and 1 cohort study of AN risks associated with cell phone use and a meta-analysis of long-term mobile phone use and its association with AN and other brain tumors. RESULTS: Most studies did not find association between the development of AN and cell phone use, but some studies that followed cases for 10 years or more did show an association. Among 10 case-control studies, odds ratios for AN associated with regular cell phone use ranged from 0.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-1.0) to 4.2 (95% CI, 1.8-10). Cell phone use was not associated with increased risk for AN in the Danish cohort study, which excluded business users from their study. The meta-analysis, which included 3 case-control studies, found that subjects who used cell phones for at least 10 years had a 2.4-fold greater risk of developing ipsilateral AN. In general, retrospective studies are limited in the ability to assess cell phone exposure because of recall bias and misclassification. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of AN risk factors is challenging due to its long latency. Some studies of longer term cell phone use have found an increased risk of ipsilateral AN. Adopting a prospective approach to acquire data on cell phone use, obtaining retrospective billing records that provide independent evaluations of exposures, and incorporating information on other key potential risk factors from questionnaires could markedly advance the capacity of studies to evaluate the impact of cell phones on AN.",M2

While cellular communication has dramatically influenced our lifestyle, its impact on human health has not been completely assessed. Widespread concern continues in the community about the deleterious effects of radiofrequency radiations (with which cell phones operate) on human tissues and the subsequent potential for carcinogenesis. A detailed survey of published studies researching this question was done in preparation of this manuscript. Included in the survey were case reports, in vitro studies, population based retrospective studies and other investigations. The database of indexed journals was searched for key words like 'cell phone', 'radiation', 'cancer' and 'radio waves'. Guidelines issued by the World Health Organization, federal and technical authorities, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers and the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection were reviewed. The evaluation of current evidence provided by various studies to suggest the possible carcinogenic potential of radiofrequency radiation is inconclusive. This risk assumes significance in light of the burgeoning number of people who are continually exposed to the high frequency radiation from cell phones and towers that serve as receiving and transmitting stations. The aim of this review is to identify limitations in past studies, present available data for consideration, and identify gaps in the current knowledge base. This will provide impetus and direction for further research and allow informed decisions pertaining to cell phone use to be made.",M2

Cell phones are known to distract motor vehicle drivers to the point that their safety is jeopardized, but it is unclear if cell phones might also distract child pedestrians. This study was designed to examine the influence of talking on a cell phone for pediatric pedestrian injury risk. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Seventy-seven children aged 10 to 11 years old completed simulated road crossings in an immersive, interactive virtual pedestrian environment. In a within-subjects design, children crossed the virtual street 6 times while undistracted and 6 times while distracted by a cell phone conversation with an unfamiliar research assistant. Participants also completed several other experimental tasks hypothesized to predict the impact of distraction while crossing the street and talking on a cell phone. RESULTS: Children's pedestrian safety was compromised when distracted by a cell phone conversation. While distracted, children were less attentive to traffic; left less safe time between their crossing and the next arriving vehicle; experienced more collisions and close calls with oncoming traffic; and waited longer before beginning to cross the street. Analyses testing experience using a cell phone and experience as a pedestrian yielded few significant results, suggesting that distraction on the cell phone might affect children's pedestrian safety no matter what their experience level. There was some indication that younger children and children who are less attentive and more oppositional may be slightly more susceptible to distraction while talking on the cell phone than older, more attentive, and less oppositional children.

The proposed mechanisms by which cell phones adversely affect various aspects of human health, and male fertility in particular, are explained, and the emerging molecular techniques and approaches for elucidating the effects of mobile phone radiation on cellular physiology using high-throughput screening techniques, such as metabolomics and microarrays, are discussed. A novel study is described, which is looking at changes in semen parameters, oxidative stress markers and sperm DNA damage in semen samples exposed in vitro to cell phone radiation.",M2

Moreover, SBHCs have insufficient resources to actively provide follow-up healthcare for students and faculty found to be overweight, chronically ill, or at high risk. In order to improve the quality of SBHC healthcare, a project was begun to enhance the efficiency of campus healthcare services by employing web-based and <e>cell</e> phone-based services. This project employed the Mobile Automated Medical Alert (MAMA) system, which was designed especially for campus health center use. Before implementing the MAMA system, a focus group of healthcare related staff identified areas in which SBHC healthcare services might be improved by the system and created a questionnaire to measure student and faculty response to the proposed services. Modifications to the MAMA design and service offerings were made based upon these questionnaire results. METHOD: After the initial brainstorming session, the MAMA team created a survey instrument that was administered to students and faculty in order to understand their attitudes toward the proposed mobile healthcare services. Two hundred questionnaires were distributed to students and faculty at a private technical college in central Taiwan. RESULTS: Among the respondents, 100% had cellular phones and used short-text messages. Ninety-five percent of the student respondents and 85% of the faculty respondents agreed that mobile healthcare system would improve the quality of the health care their SBHC was currently providing. Based on these positive survey responses, the MAMA system was implemented. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The current paper describes the process by which the MAMA team brainstormed proposed services and administered their survey. Survey results and the consequent changes to the MAMA system are discussed. Finally, recommendations are made for MAMA system use and a description is offered of the impact such systems might have on the future of college campus healthcare services.",M2

Using everyday technology, in the form of a cell-phone, video reminders are delivered to assist with daily activities. The proposed CPVS system will permit carers to record and schedule video reminders remotely using a standard personal computer and web cam. It is the aim of the three year project that through the frequent delivery of helpful video reminders that a 'virtual carer' will be present with the person with dementia at all times. The first prototype of the system has been fully implemented with the first field trial scheduled to take place in May 2008. Initially, only three patient carer dyads will be involved, however, the second field trial aims to involve 30 dyads in the study. Details of the first prototype and the methods of evaluation are presented herein.",M2
