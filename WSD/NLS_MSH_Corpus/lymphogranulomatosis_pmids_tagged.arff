Using ELISA kits it was shown that the highest cystatin C concentration was in human cerebrospinal fluid and low cystatin C concentration was in human urine. In healthy young persons serum cystatin C concentration was lower than in elder patients (50-65 year old). In patients with hemoblastoses (lymphoma, <e>lymphogranulomatosis</e>) increased serum cystatin C concentration was normalized after effective antitumor therapy. According to these data one can conclude that serum cystatin C concentration can be used as one of the prognostic criteria in patients with several kinds of hemoblastoses.",M2

17078219,"[Ten-year outcomes of <e>lymphogranulomatosis</e> treatment according to the protocol MOPP-ABVD+radiotherapy]AIM: To analyse overall recurrence-free survival of lymphogranulomatosis (LGM) patients given polychemotherapy (PCT) MOPP (mustargen-caryolisin, vincristine, natulan, prednisolone) - ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastin, dacarbasin) in combination with radiotherapy (RT) for 10 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial included 211 LGM patients admitted to Hematological Research Center in 1990-1996 from other hospitals without random selection. The patients were examined by the standard program including biopsy of the affected organ or lymph node, bilateral trephine biopsy. Splenectomy was performed in 17 patients, 83 patients received PCT in other hospitals, 128 untreated patients received MOPP-ABVD therapy (3 courses of MOPP and 3 courses of ABVD). Forty one patients had defects in PCT, 16 of them rejected PCT and RT. The latter was performed 4 weeks after the 6th course, contraceptives were not prescribed to women. At LGM stage II-III RT was performed by the subradical program (no radiation to ilioinguinal lymph nodes) in doses 40-44 Gy on the foci and 32-36 Gy preventively, on massive and residual foci after PCT - 5-10 Gy additionally. RESULTS: Ten-year overall and recurrence-free survival in the untreated group reached 83 and 80%, respectively, for pretreated patients - 46 and 36%, respectively. Causes of death of 26 patients were LGM progression, infection (tuberculosis, as a rule), secondary tumors and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). After remission 25 women gave birth to a healthy child and 12 healthy children were born to 9 males. CONCLUSION: MOPP-ABVD plus radiotherapy program according to subradical and radical variants was in the past effective but invalidating rescue therapy. Present-day programs consider the histological variant, stage and prognostic factors allowing an individual therapeutic approach with step-by-step reduction of RT in the treatment of LGM patients. Involvement of the bone marrow in primary patients had no influence on the treatment results. This refers this affection not to a generalized stage IV, but to stage III along with involvement of the lymph nodes and the spleen.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 44 patients, including 26 with various types of lymphogranulomatosis (LGM) and 18 with lymphosarcomas were examined at different stages of antitumor treatment. Radionuclide equilibrium ventriculography (REVG), echocardiography (EchoCG), and electrocardiography (ECG) were used. Postmortem studies of the myocardial histological pattern were conducted in 20 patients (archive data). RESULTS: No significant pathological REVG, EchoCG, and ECG changes were found in 10 patients examined prior to treatment. In a group of 17 patients receiving a total dose of doxorubicine of 240 +/- 30 mg/m2, there was a significant decrease in diastolic duration, a reduction in diastolic volume, end systolic volume, stroke volume, stroke index, filling fraction over 1/3 diastole. In a group of 17 patients receiving a total dose of doxorubicine of 250 +/- 30 mg/m2 and radiotherapy applied to the mediastinum, the above changes were more marked. There were myocardial histomorphological changes whose magnitude progressed as therapy became more intensive. CONCLUSION. The findings have indicated that by using relatively small cumulative dose of anthracyclines, cardiovascular dysfunction can occur at the early stages of programmed treatment for LGM and lymphosarcomas. REVG has the greatest advantage in their detection.",M2

A comparative analysis was performed of efficacy and ill effects of lyposomal and free forms of doxorubicini hydrochloridum. It has been shown that by clinical effectiveness the drug preparation lypodox, doxorubicini hydrochloridum in a lyposomal form, is superior to doxorubicini hydrochloridum in a free form in resistant and aggressive forms of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Side reactions developing in the wake of lypodox administration do not threaten the life and health of patients; these do not preclude us from employing the drug in a clinical setting.",M2

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 100 patients with verified lymphogranulematosis were studied: 67 with lymphosarcoma and 33 with mediastinal involvement. The mediastinal tumor monitoring was made before therapy, in complete clinicohematological remission, in progression using a complex of radio-, clinicohematological, histomorphological and radionuclide methods. RESULTS: A comparative analysis of the findings of radiation, radionuclide and histomorphological examinations of the removed residual mediastinal tumor in 10 patients showed that scintigraphic evidence was similar to that of histological findings in most of the examinees. CONCLUSION: A high diagnostic efficacy of a complex of radiation and radionuclide methods with Ga-67 citrate based on estimation of accumulation intensity providing comprehensive information about mediastinal tumor is demonstrated. A comparative analysis was made of the results of radiation, radionuclide and histomorphological examinations of the removed residual lesion of the mediastinum in 10 patients. In most cases, scintigraphic findings coincided with the results of histological studies of biopsies of mediastinal residual lesion.",M2

Mean follow up period after discontinuation of therapy was 5.5 years (range 2.6-8.3 years). Interview (estimation of physical activity, other chronic disease, and fractures), anthropometric measurements of body mass and height, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density total (BMD Total) and spine (BMD Spine) were obtained from every child. Gained findings were compared to the same parameters in the group of 473 healthy children, comparable in age and gender with examined group and showed as SD score. There were no differences in BMI and BMD Total and Spine between patients and controls. No correlation was found between the BMD values and the diagnosis, age at diagnosis, gender and cranial irradiation and duration of follow-up. BMD Spine SD score was significantly increased in a subgroup of patients in pubertal stage at diagnosis as compared to patients in prepubertal stage. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effect on BMD in patients with cancer and how to prevent a decrease of BMD.",M2

In 2-6 years before the study all patients had been treated with combination radio- (36-44 Gy) and chemotherapy. Echocardiography revealed endomyocardial fibrosis and signs of cardiac remodeling (reduced left ventricular dimensions and volumes, decreased myocardial mass and impaired diastolic function). The patients were divided into 2 groups. Patients of group 1 were given enalapril (5-10 mg/day), of group 2 - potassium and magnesium aspartate and inosine.

MATERIALS AND MATERIALS: 78 patients received radiation and chemotherapy for lymphogranulomatosis in 1973 to 1995. All the patients underwent electro- and echocardiography (EchoCG), 40 patients had radioisotopic ventriculography (RVG). RESULTS: EchoCG revealed nonspecific changes in the ST segment in 19 (24.3%) patients. Systolic function was decreased vto 46% only in 1 patient. RVG showed a significant reduction in ejection fraction in the experimental group as compared to the control one (55.5 +/- 9.5 and 68.4 +/- 8.0, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cardiac disorders revealed in patients with LGM at prolonged remission are mainly insignificant.

Forty-five cases of histologically confirmed malignant gastric lymphoma diagnosed throughout 1981-2000 period are discussed. The disease was diagnosed to 37 patients only after surgery and to other eight by means of endoscopical investigation. Before establishing the correct diagnosis, gastric carcinoma was supposed to 27 patients, gastric ulcer to 12 patients, gastropathia erosiva to 6 patients. Histologically primary non-Hodgkin gastric lymphoma was diagnosed to 29 patients. That consisted 78.3 per cent of all surgically treated patients, 64.4 per cent of histologically confirmed cases and 1.2 per cent of all diagnosed malignant lymphomas. Gastric <e>lymphogranulomatosis</e> was diagnosed to 16 patients. Primary lymphogranulomatosis three cases. After supposed stomach cancer, three patients were operated.

Sets for immune-enzyme assay of cystatin C in human blood serum (KRKK, Slovenia) were made used of in the case study. The concentration of cystatin C (CCC) in blood serum was found to be higher in cases of certain hemoblastoses (Non-Hodgkin's disease, <e>lymphogranulomatosis</e> and multiple myeloma), with the highest concentration of the inhibitor being observed in patients with resistance to the conducted polychemotherapy and a poor prognostication. The treatment of Non-Hodgkin's disease and of lymphogranulomatosis brought about a normalized CCC in blood serum. It was suggested that CCC in blood serum reflects a nature of tumor growth and, obviously, it can be a criterion in assessing the therapy efficiency.

The most pronounced disorders of the diastolic function were detected in patients with pericardial involvement. More pronounced tumor intoxication in patients with mixed-cell variant of the tumor resulted in remodeling of the left ventricle, left atrial dysfunction, and restructuring of the diastolic bloodflow, which indicated combined impairment of the left ventricular diastolic relaxation and left atrial contractility. Chemotherapy augmented disorders in diastolic bloodflow, the increase in the number of polychemotherapy courses being associated with a trend to deterioration of left-ventricular relaxation. Hence, tumor intoxication and drug cardiotoxicity determine the formation of central hemodynamic disorders, one of whose principal components is diastolic dysfunction of the left heart ventricle.",M2

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cytokine concentrations were measured in 87 samples of serum (plasma) from 54 patients by ELISA. Diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was made histologically in 24 and 30 patients, respectively. RESULTS: The threshold concentrations of sCD30 (and less specific sIL-2R) for HD and NHL patients allowed to estimate sensitivity to chemotherapy after the second course. The threshold concentration of IL-10 can distinguish HD from NHL. Changes in IL-6 concentrations were nonspecific. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the threshold concentrations of sCD30 and IL-10 we offer the scheme of lymphoma diagnosis and prediction of the disease sensitivity to chemotherapy which reduce the duration of lymphoma restaging.",M2

To find out a group of patients in whom surgical removal of the residual mediastinal mass would be most effective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 46 patients with Hodgkin's disease received Dexa-BEAM chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. Surgical removal of the residual mediastinal mass was made in 12 patients. RESULTS: Second-line Dexa-BEAM therapy produced a 50% complete remission rate. Overall survival was 45.5%, the disease-free survival--43.5%. Removed mediastinal masses were indicative of Hodgkin's disease in 7 cases and fibrosis in 4 cases. CONCLUSION: Dexa-BEAM is an effective program in the treatment of recurrent and refractory Hodgkin's disease. Surgical removal of the residual mediastinal mass with radiotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy improves prognosis in very unfavorable, primary progressive form of Hodgkin's disease.",M2

Echocardiography was carried out on the unit Sigma-44 and Toshiba. RESULTS: Some changes in the heart by type of myocardiodystrophy or endomyocardial fibrosis were found. The latter are characterized by diminution of the left and (or) right ventricles due to apex obliteration, hardening and thickening of the endocardium and subvalvular structures, diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. The main and additional signs are distinguished. The reasons of endomyocardial fibrosis are discussed: severity of the disease, frequent exacerbations and, consequently, higher doses of specific chemoradiotherapy.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 27 LGM patients aged 16-42 years who have undergone TAHC after high-dose PCT (BEAM--17 patients or CBV--10 patients). 4 patients given high-dose PCT were in the first-second complete remission (CR), 7 patients--in the first partial remission (PR). Prior to TAHC, 8 patients had one, two and more relapses of LGM, and 8 patients had no remission at all. Bone marrow, hemopoietic blood cells and both were transplanted to 17, 2 and 8 patients, respectively. Mobilization of hemopoietic blood cells and stimulation of hemopoiesis after TAHC were achieved using colony-stimulating factors. RESULTS: The treatment resulted in CR or PR (from 6 to 95 months) in 70.4% of patients. The remission duration varied depending on the disease phase at transplantation. Four patients who underwent TAHC in PR maintained it for 13-95 months (median 47.5 months). Lasting remissions (29-59 months) were achieved in 42.9 and 37.5% of patients who underwent TAHC in the first PR or in recurrent LGM. None of the patients was in remission longer than 2 years after TAHC if high-dose PCT was conducted in advanced tumor process due to resistant LGM or inadequate previous treatment. Infectious complications lethality early after the transplantation reached 7.4%(2 patients). CONCLUSION: High-dose PCT followed by TAHC is effective in LGM if the tumor is chemosensitive.",M2
11201835,"[Immunogenetic markers in hemoblastosis]AIM: To establish for hemoblastoses general and individual associations between HLA genes and predisposition or resistance to malignant transformation of hemopoiesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antigens of class I and class II genes were determined by microlymphocytotoxic test and DNA typing (PCR-SSP) in 30 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), 47 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 52 patients with chronic myeloblastic leukemia (CML), 58 patients with <e>lymphogranulomatosis</e> (LGM) and 224 donors. RESULTS: HLA specificities were elucidated frequency of which was high in all the above nosological entities: Cw7 (RR 2.5 to 5.22), DRB1*11 (RR 2.3 to 4.88). Frequency of antigen B5 was high in three diseases (RR 2.14-2.6). A number of specificities have distribution deviations typical for only one or two diseases (A19--AML and CML, B27--ALL, DRB1*08--AML). The HLA-gene was detected the frequency of which was low in three diseases--DRB1*07 (RR 0.39 to 0.11). Individual preventive HLA genes for AML, ALL, LGM were A2, B8; A1, B8, B40; DRB1*01, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cw7, DRB1*11, B5 are HLA-specificities marking hemopoiesis predisposition to malignant transformation in general. Development into a certain nosological entity depends on combination of general HLA-genes with markers of individual hemoblastosis. DRB1*07 is a general preventive gene. Preventive HLA genes can be also individual for the above hematological diseases.",M2
9742638,"[The factors of hereditary predisposition to <e>lymphogranulomatosis</e>]AIM: To determine genetic factors of predisposition marked HLA with reference to serological and molecular characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups of patients were included in the study: 51 patients with lymphogranulomatosis (LGM), 33 healthy relatives of these patients, 37 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 24 healthy relatives of these CML patients. 224 donors served control. HLA-antigens were identified with the lymphocytoxic test and PSR-MSSR. Results of typing of class II antigens were taken into consideration in coincidence of serological and DNA typing. The significance of the differences was estimated according to the chi-square criterion. RESULTS: Differences in frequency of distribution of HLA-antigens (subloci A and B) were not found. Antigen CW7 was present in 70, DR5 in 60, DR6 in 50% of LGM patients. This frequency was much higher than in control groups. Carriers of CW7 are at 7 times higher risk to develop LGM. Among LGM patients the number of homozygous individuals is higher than in healthy ones (50 and 15.6%) while the number of individuals with a complete set of HLA-A.B antigens is significantly less. CONCLUSION: Genetic predisposition to LGM is predetermined by HLA antigens CW7, DR5, DR6. Genes HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR7 protect carriers from factors provoking LGM. Common HLA genes in the parents predispose their children to LGM. Insufficiency of the phenotype is a factor predisposing to LGM.",M2

9235640,"[Influence of reduction of radiation dosage on the incidence of radiation-induced pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis and pericarditis after mediastinal irradiation in the treatment of <e>lymphogranulomatosis</e>]BACKGROUND: The amount of radiation dose applied in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease is associated with the incidence of complications including radiation-induced pneumonitis, lung fibrosis and pericarditis. Therefore, from the beginning of 1986, we have started to apply a radiation therapy approach with reduced doses in order to minimize complications while maintaining effective treatment. PATIENTS AND METHOD: From 1983 through 1992 141 patients suffering from Hodgkin's disease were included in the present study. All of them were treated by radiation of mediastinum. In 126 cases polychemotherapy was applied before radiation. From 1986 we used a reduced radiation dose in cases that were treated by radiation alone (affected nodal regions with 40 Gy instead of 45 Gy and unaffected nodal regions with 36 Gy instead of 40 Gy) as well as after application of chemotherapy (affected nodal regions 36 Gy instead of 40 Gy and unaffected nodal regions with 30 Gy instead of 36 Gy). Ninety-five patients were treated according to the new therapy protocol. Forty-six patients had been treated with the higher dosages and served as the historical control group. Radiation therapy included Co-60, 15-MV and 9-MV photons, and 15-MeV and 9-MeV electrons. Serial thoracic X-ray controls were performed. CT scans, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic investigations were added in selected cases. RESULTS: During the period from 1983 to 1992, we diagnosed radiation-induced pneumonitis in 31% of the patients who underwent radiation therapy of the mediastinum. In addition, 16% demonstrated lung fibrosis and 10% pericarditis. After implementation of the reduced radiation dosages, the incidence of pneumonitis decreased from 35% to 24% (nearly significant in the 5% range), lung fibrosis from 24% to 12% (p &lt; 0.05) and pericarditis from 26% to 2% (p &lt; 0.01). The efficacy of treatment remained unaffected by the new therapy approach as has been demonstrated for cumulative survival data and recurrence-free intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of radiation dose in patients with Hodgkin's disease who undergo mediastinal radiation leads to a decrease in the incidence of radiation-induced complications (pneumonitis, lung fibrosis, pericarditis) whereas treatment efficacy remains unchanged.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 212 LGM patients were examined for hepatic lesions using x-ray, radiological, cytochemical and histological investigations of the biopsies. Coagulation, alkaline phosphatase, copper and ceruloplasmin in the serum were measured to evaluation the disease activity. All the patients received polychemotherapy (PCT). Irradiation of the liver in the total focal dose 36-44 Gy was performed in confirmed involvement of the liver as adjuvant to PCT. RESULTS: Specific liver lesions were detected in 6.1% of patients at primary examination and in 15.6%--at follow-up. Liver lesions occurred most frequently in mixed-cell variant of LGM and lymphoid depletion. Eradication of liver lesion after PCT was achieved in 15.4%. Subsequent radiation produced a complete remission in 100% of patients with diffuse and 80% of patients with large-focal liver lesion. In detection of liver involvement at the time of LGM progression eradication and remission were achieved in 70 and 50% of patients, respectively. From 30% of patients with liver lesions resistant to PCT and radiation, 15% had stable disease. The survival did not depend on eradication of liver lesion.

Myelograms were found to vary with sex and age of the patients demonstrating close relations between hemopoiesis and processes in the lymph nodes. In males maturation of myeloid elements KM was inhibited, though they had more monocytes KM. These monocytes got more numerous in unfavorable histological variants and generalization. Lymphopenia and monocytosis were more pronounced in patients under 30 becoming more severe in generalization and intoxication. Age-related changes in cholesterol in lymphogranulomatosis patients were abnormal: in older patients cholesterol was low. This phenomenon is extremely unfavorable.

In clinical stages I to II (A and B) of Hodgkin's disease radiotherapy alone is curative in more than 80% of the patients. Challenges remain, however, to further refine our therapy, identify and cure the minority of patients who continue to succumb to this disease. Innovative therapies or significant modifications of current standard therapies are very much needed. The sequential approach of drugs and radiation therapy could reduce the length (not the dose!) of primary chemotherapy as well as the extent and the dose of additive radiation. An effective polydrug regimen not including alkylating agents may avoid the risk of infertility and second malignancies. In patients with Hodgkin's disease presenting with massive mediastinal involvement the efficacy of combined modality therapy has been proven by all research groups. In patients with clinical stage III (A and B) as well as selected stage IV Hodgkin's disease the percentage of nodal relapse is not negligible even after a very effective chemotherapy.

The only radiation therapy was employed for 11.3% of patients, chemical therapy--for 1.2%, and combined therapy in which both radiation and chemical therapy were used--87%. The simultaneous employment of radiation and chemical therapy led to a considerable reduction of the period of treatment, moreover there were no pronounced depressions in medullary hemoplasty. The further progression of the disease was commonly marked only in the cases with general manifestation of illness and affection of more than two globate glands. It is recommended to continue polychemical treatment for a year after the patient's recovery in order to prevent relapses.",M2
1890940,"[The combined (polychemical and radiation) and drug treatment of <e>lymphogranulomatosis</e> patients with generalized lung involvement (stage IV)]The paper is concerned with analysis of the peculiarities of a course of disease and effectiveness of different therapeutic programs in 121 primary patients suffering from Hodgkin's disease with generalized lung lesion (true stage IV). The 5-year total and recurrence-free survival of patients after polychemoradiotherapy was 59.5 and 45.6%, respectively. Prognosis of disease in patient with generalized lung lesion is determined mainly by the development of a specific process in pulmonary tissue and, to a lesser degree, by spreading of disease via the lymphatic collectors. The authors have shown the appropriateness of combined therapy of this group of patients. Therapy includes cycles of polychemotherapy for achieving remission and radiotherapy including total irradiation of the affected lung for its consolidation.",M2
1842663,"[The diagnosis and treatment of <e>lymphogranulomatosis</e> in children]Results of treatment of 124 pediatric patients with Hodgkin's disease with a follow-up period of not less than 5 years were analysed. The diagnostic workup included laparotomy. As a result, stage of disease was changed in 24 (28.5%) out of 84 operated patients. Treatment with CVPP combination chemotherapy (several cycles) and extended-field telegammatherapy yielded a five-year survival rate of 86.2% with 77.4% of patients being free from relapse. Splenectomy did not influence long-term results: five-year survival rates in operated and non-operated patients were 86.9 and 85%, respectively. No delayed toxicity associated with chemoradiation treatment was encountered.",M2
1792602,"[The immunological validation and the potentials and prospects of using immunocorrective agents in treating hemoblastoses]Immunocorrection was provided to 94 patients with hemoblastoses. Of these, 50 patients suffered from <e>lymphogranulomatosis</e> and 8 from acute leukemias. Levamisole (decaris, Hungary) and the Soviet drug tactivin were applied as immunocorrectors. The effects of levamisole and tactivin in chronic lymphoid leukemia are combined. They are related to immunologic differentiation of the cells. The patients showed an increase of the count of E-RFC, a decline of the B cell count with superficial immunoglobulins, Em-RFC, changes in the T mu: T gamma cell ratio, and the maintenance of the level of serum immunoglobulins. As a result of the continuous administration of immunocorrectors, there was a rise of the count of B cells with immunoglobulins in the cytoplasm. The continuous use of immunocorrectors favours stabilization of the course of the underlying disease, an increase of the patients' life expectancy. In patients with lymphogranulomatosis, the use of levamisole as part of the multimodality treatment leads to an increase of the count of E-RFC, augmentation of the life expectancy. The treatment with immunocorrectors should be carried out under control of the immunity parameters.",M2

STRB was established to produce marked immediate and steady anticancer effects manifesting in the removal of intoxication, a reduction of the size of the lymph nodes and specific infiltration in the lungs, and the lowering of the ESR. The duration of STRB was 10.6 days on the average, with the interval till the next treatment stage amounting to 31.2 days. The regularities were established in the time-course of changes in the hematological parameters in the course of and after STRB, permitting one to define them as a subacute radiation syndrome.",M2
1788806,"[The combined therapy of stage-II <e>lymphogranulomatosis</e>: the effect of splenectomy and the time period for achieving full remission on treatment efficacy]In 1982-1986, 72 patients with stage II lymphogranulomatosis received combined treatment according to the following program: 3 cycles of polychemotherapy in accordance with the CVPP scheme plus radiation of all the lymphatic collectors above the diaphragm up to the total radiation dose 35 Gy plus 3 cycles according to the CVPP. Splenectomy was provided to 45 patients; spleen impairment was revealed in 13. The median observation period reached 67 months. Both short- and long-term results of the treatment were analyzed. Neither splenectomy nor specific impairment thereof exerted any effect on the treatment results of this patients' group. The predominance of a number of  favourable  prognostic factors in splenectomized patients produced no effect on the treatment efficacy. It is concluded that in this patients' group, splenectomy is not advisable. A significant relationship was discovered between both survival and duration of the relapse-free course and the times of complete remission attainment. In patients, in whom complete remission was ascertained after 3 cycles of polychemotherapy and before radiotherapy onset, the 7-year survival amounted to 100% whereas the 7-year relapse-free course was recorded in 98% of cases, which is significantly higher than in patients, in whom only partial remission was attained by that time--78 and 68%, respectively (p less than 0.05).",M2
1788804,"[Risk factors and survival prognosis in <e>lymphogranulomatosis</e>: a statistical analysis]To examine risk factors and to design prognostic models for the total, relapse-free and after-relapse survival, use was made of the Cox model for unifactorial and multidimensional analysis based on the retrospective estimation of the results of the treatment of 235 patients with lymphogranulomatosis, stages II-III. Radiotherapy according to the radical program was carried out in conjunction with polychemotherapy according to the COPP scheme. The number of areas of damage, massiveness of injury to the mediastinum, involvement of the spleen into the process appeared the most informative risk factors for predicting both total and relapse-free survival. The prediction of the after-relapse survival was considerably influenced by the age combined with carrying out of not less than 3 cycles of polychemotherapy given to the patients during initial treatment or with the presence of intoxication symptoms and increased ESR. The tables of the survival probability were calculated.",M2

All the patients received treatment from 1976 to 1990 according to three combined programs. The necessity is demonstrated of the individual treatment with regard to the predictors. Immunocorrection by means of taktivin was employed in patients with immunity disorders. The perfection of a complex of treatment measures favoured an increase of the survival to over 5 years in 93.8% of cases.",M2
