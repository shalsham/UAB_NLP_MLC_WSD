20503689,"<e>Plague</e>, pox and the physician in Aberdeen, 1495-1516.This article discusses responses to disease in Aberdeen during a formative period in the provision of healthcare within the city. The foundation of King's College was followed, in 1497, by the establishment of the first royally endowed university Chair of Medicine in the British Isles, and its first incumbent, James Cumming, was employed by the local government as the first city doctor in 1503. His appointment had been preceded in 1497 by another legislative innovation in Aberdeen, when its council became the first civic body in the British Isles to implement regulations against the threat of the Great Pox (usually considered to be syphilis). It had subsequently to pass measures to prevent the spread of plague to the city, and these were typical of those already imposed elsewhere in Scotland and on the continent. Their apparent success in staving off plague lasted until 1514, when the city was struck by a severe outbreak which lasted two years.",M1

20439974,"Assessing human risk of exposure to <e>plague</e> bacteria in northwestern Uganda based on remotely sensed predictors.Plague, a life-threatening flea-borne zoonosis caused by Yersinia pestis, has most commonly been reported from eastern Africa and Madagascar in recent decades. In these regions and elsewhere, prevention and control efforts are typically targeted at fine spatial scales, yet risk maps for the disease are often presented at coarse spatial resolutions that are of limited value in allocating scarce prevention and control resources. In our study, we sought to identify sub-village level remotely sensed correlates of elevated risk of human exposure to plague bacteria and to project the model across the plague-endemic West Nile region of Uganda and into neighboring regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our model yielded an overall accuracy of 81%, with sensitivities and specificities of 89% and 71%, respectively. Risk was higher above 1,300 meters than below, and the remotely sensed covariates that were included in the model implied that localities that are wetter, with less vegetative growth and more bare soil during the dry month of January (when agricultural plots are typically fallow) pose an increased risk of plague case occurrence. Our results suggest that environmental and landscape features play a large part in classifying an area as ecologically conducive to plague activity. However, it is clear that future studies aimed at identifying behavioral and fine-scale ecological risk factors in the West Nile region are required to fully assess the risk of human exposure to Y. pestis.",M1

20400901,"Septic shock and nonpulmonary organ dysfunction in pneumonic <e>plague</e>: the role of Yersinia pestis pCD1- vs. pgm- virulence factors.OBJECTIVE: Pneumonic plague resulting from Yersinia pestis induces swiftly lethal sepsis and is a major concern as a weapon of bioterrorism. However, the role of specific plasmid-encoded vs. chromosomal Y. pestis virulence factors in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury, shock, and nonpulmonary dysfunction is unclear. We hypothesized that the pathophysiology of pneumonic plague resulting from expression of proteins encoded by the thermally regulated pCD1 plasmid differs from cardiopulmonary and inflammatory changes attributable to the chromosomal pgm gene locus. DESIGN: Prospective, experimental study. SETTING: Research laboratory at a university medical center. SUBJECTS: Conscious, chronically catheterized male Sprague-Dawley rats (total n=104). INTERVENTIONS: Rats were intratracheally infected with 109 colony-forming units of Y. pestis attenuated strains CO99 (pCD1+/DeltaApgm) or KIM6+ (pCD1-/pgm+) and evaluated over 6 days. Serial evaluations of vital signs, cardiorespiratory parameters, blood cultures, inflammatory biomarkers, and organ function were obtained, as well as organ histopathology and cytokine production. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Despite equivalent endotoxin contents between the inocula, CO99-infected animals had a median survival of 3 days with greater nonpulmonary organ injury, microbial growth, serum alanine aminotransferase, and liver microvascular permeability vs. KIM6+-infected animals (p&lt;.05). Parallel differences occurred in serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels. Notably, 75% of CO99 rats developed fatal hypotension after developing nonpulmonary organ damage. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that progression to lethal sepsis with augmented liver injury during plague pneumonia requires factors encoded by the pCD1 plasmid but not chromosomal proteins present within the pgm gene locus.",M1
20385751,"Milestones in progression of primary pneumonic <e>plague</e> in cynomolgus macaques.Vaccines against primary pneumonic plague, a potential bioweapon, must be tested for efficacy in well-characterized nonhuman primate models. Telemetered cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were challenged by the aerosol route with doses equivalent to approximately 100 50% effective doses of Yersinia pestis strain CO92 and necropsied at 24-h intervals postexposure (p.e.). Data for telemetered heart rates, respiratory rates, and increases in the temperature greater than the diurnal baseline values identified the onset of the systemic response at 55 to 60 h p.e. in all animals observed for at least 70 h p.e. Bacteremia was detected at 72 h p.e. by a Yersinia 16S rRNA-specific quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and was detected later by the culture method at the time of moribund necropsy. By 72 h p.e. multilobar pneumonia with diffuse septal inflammation consistent with early bacteremia was established, and all lung tissues had a high bacterial burden. The levels of cytokines or chemokines in serum were not significantly elevated at any time, and only the interleukin-1beta, CCL2, and CCL3 levels were elevated in lung tissue. Inhalational plague in the cynomolgus macaque inoculated by the aerosol route produces most clinical features of the human disease, and in addition the disease progression mimics the disease progression from the anti-inflammatory phase to the proinflammatory phase described for the murine model. Defined milestones of disease progression, particularly the onset of fever, tachypnea, and bacteremia, should be useful for evaluating the efficacy of candidate vaccines.",M1
20308296,"Fine-tuning synthesis of Yersinia pestis LcrV from runaway-like replication balanced-lethal plasmid in a Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine induces protection against a lethal Y. pestis challenge in mice.A balanced-lethal plasmid expression system that switches from low-copy-number to runaway-like high-copy-number replication (pYA4534) was constructed for the regulated delayed in vivo synthesis of heterologous antigens by vaccine strains. This is an antibiotic resistance-free maintenance system containing the asdA gene (essential for peptidoglycan synthesis) as a selectable marker to complement the lethal chromosomal DeltaasdA allele in live recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccines (RASVs) such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain chi9447. pYA4534 harbors two origins of replication, pSC101 and pUC (low and high copy numbers, respectively). The pUC replication origin is controlled by a genetic switch formed by the operator/promoter of the P22 cro gene (O/P(cro)) (P(R)), which is negatively regulated by an arabinose-inducible P22 c2 gene located on both the plasmid and the chromosome (araC P(BAD) c2). The absence of arabinose, which is unavailable in vivo, triggers replication to a high-copy-number plasmid state. To validate these vector attributes, the Yersinia pestis virulence antigen LcrV was used to develop a vaccine against <e>plague</e>. An lcrV sequence encoding amino acids 131 to 326 (LcrV196) was optimized for expression in Salmonella, flanked with nucleotide sequences encoding the signal peptide (SS) and the carboxy-terminal domain (CT) of beta-lactamase, and cloned into pYA4534 under the control of the P(trc) promoter to generate plasmid pYA4535. Our results indicate that the live Salmonella vaccine strain chi9447 harboring pYA4535 efficiently stimulated a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response that protected mice against lethal challenge with Y. pestis strain CO92 introduced through either the intranasal or subcutaneous route.",M1
20230231,"How to reduce the impact of  low-risk patients  following a bioterrorist incident: lessons from SARS, anthrax, and pneumonic <e>plague</e>.A bioterrorist attack may result in a large number of people who have not been exposed coming to medical facilities in search of treatment or reassurance. In this article, we review evidence from 3 previous biological incidents that are analogous to a bioterrorist attack in order to gauge the likely incidence of such  low-risk patients  and to identify possible strategies for coping with this phenomenon. Evidence from the anthrax attacks in the United States suggested that a surge of low-risk patients is by no means inevitable. Data from the SARS outbreak illustrated that if hospitals are seen as sources of contagion, many patients with non-bioterrorism-related healthcare needs may delay seeking help. Finally, the events surrounding the pneumonic plague outbreak of 1994 in Surat, India, highlighted the need for the public to be kept adequately informed about an incident. Although it is impossible to say what the likely incidence of low-risk patients will be during a future bioterrorist incident, several strategies may help to reduce it and to safeguard the well-being of the low-risk patients themselves. These strategies include providing clear information about who should and should not attend hospital; using telephone services to provide more detailed information and initial screening; employing rapid triage at hospital entrances, based, where possible, on exposure history and objective signs of illness; and following up by telephone those judged to be at low risk.",M1
20209360,"[Prevalence of antibodies against Yersinia pestis in domestic carnivores, in <e>plague</e> foci in the State of Ceará]The prevalence of antibodies against Yersinia pestis in domestic carnivores (dogs and cats), in plague areas in the State of Ceará, was analyzed to establish the importance of monitoring these animals within the routine practice of the plague control program. Over the decade 1997-2006, 146,732 serum samples were examined (95,883 from dogs and 50,849 from cats), of which 2,629 (2,234 from dogs and 395 from cats) proved to be positive. The prevalence among dogs (85%) was higher than among cats (15%) throughout the decade and in all places, except in Ibiapina in 1998. The significance of these findings has not yet been determined. Studies on this zoonosis in Brazil have been based on paradigms that did not cover all the elements involved in the zoonosis, thus making it impossible to properly understand the role of these carnivores. Monitoring of plague foci conducted exclusively by means of dog surveys may result in progressive lack of knowledge of the epidemiological situation of plague, if supplementary inter-institutional research is not developed.",M1
20207880,"Predicting potential risk areas of human <e>plague</e> for the Western Usambara Mountains, Lushoto District, Tanzania.A natural focus of plague exists in the Western Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. Despite intense research, questions remain as to why and how plague emerges repeatedly in the same suite of villages. We used human plague incidence data for 1986-2003 in an ecological-niche modeling framework to explore the geographic distribution and ecology of human plague. Our analyses indicate that plague occurrence is related directly to landscape-scale environmental features, yielding a predictive understanding of one set of environmental factors affecting plague transmission in East Africa. Although many environmental variables contribute significantly to these models, the most important are elevation and Enhanced Vegetation Index derivatives. Projections of these models across broader regions predict only 15.5% (under a majority-rule threshold) or 31,997 km(2) of East Africa as suitable for plague transmission, but they successfully anticipate most known foci in the region, making possible the development of a risk map of plague.",M1
20190973,"Tularemia, <e>plague</e>, yersiniosis, and Tyzzer's disease in wild rodents and lagomorphs in Canada: a review.Information related to infection of wild rodents or lagomorphs in Canada by Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, other Yersinia spp., and Clostridium piliforme was searched for this study. Reports on tularemia in humans linked to these species came from diagnostic databases, literature, wildlife health specialists, and public health agencies. Tularemia has been diagnosed in 8 species of wild rodent and 2 species in the genus Lepus in Canada. Tularemia occurred in wild animals, or in humans associated with these species, in all jurisdictions except the Yukon and Nunavut. Tularemia was diagnosed most frequently in beaver, muskrats, and snowshoe hares, and although tularemia is closely linked to cottontail rabbits in the USA, it has not been reported in cottontails in Canada. Tularemia in humans was associated with muskrats and hares more commonly than with beaver. Plague was diagnosed in bushy-tailed woodrats in British Columbia in 1988. Based on surveys, Y. pestis may occur enzootically in southern Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia. Infection with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica has been diagnosed in beaver, muskrats, and snowshoe hares in many provinces. Tyzzer's disease has been diagnosed in muskrats in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Quebec and in snowshoe hares in Ontario. Infection with these bacteria is likely much more frequent than indicated by diagnostic records.",M1

20160020,"The yersiniabactin transport system is critical for the pathogenesis of bubonic and pneumonic <e>plague</e>.Iron acquisition from the host is an important step in the pathogenic process. While Yersinia pestis has multiple iron transporters, the yersiniabactin (Ybt) siderophore-dependent system plays a major role in iron acquisition in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we determined that the Ybt system is required for the use of iron bound by transferrin and lactoferrin and examined the importance of the Ybt system for virulence in mouse models of bubonic and pneumonic plague. Y. pestis mutants unable to either transport Ybt or synthesize the siderophore were both essentially avirulent via subcutaneous injection (bubonic plague model). Surprisingly, via intranasal instillation (pneumonic plague model), we saw a difference in the virulence of Ybt biosynthetic and transport mutants. Ybt biosynthetic mutants displayed an approximately 24-fold-higher 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) than transport mutants. In contrast, under iron-restricted conditions in vitro, a Ybt transport mutant had a more severe growth defect than the Ybt biosynthetic mutant. Finally, a Delta pgm mutant had a greater loss of virulence than the Ybt biosynthetic mutant, indicating that the 102-kb pgm locus encodes a virulence factor, in addition to Ybt, that plays a role in the pathogenesis of pneumonic plague.",M1
20158336,"Recent findings regarding maintenance of enzootic variants of Yersinia pestis in sylvatic reservoirs and their significance in the evolution of epidemic <e>plague</e>.Despite the widespread presence of bubonic plague in sylvatic reservoirs throughout the world, the causative agent (Yersinia pestis) evolved in its present form within the last 20,000 years from enteropathogenic Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Comparison of the genomes from the two species revealed that Y. pestis possesses only a few unique plasmid-encoded genes that contribute to acute disease, whereas this organism has lost about 13% of the chromosomal genes that remain active in Y. pseudotuberculosis. These losses reflect readily detectable additions, deletions, transpositions, inversions, and acquisition of about 70 insertion sequence (IS) inserts, none of which are likely to promote increased virulence. In contrast, major enzymes of intermediary metabolism, including glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf ) and aspartase, are present but not catalytically functional due to the presence of missense mutations. The latter are generally not detectable by the technology of bioinformatics and, in the case of Y. pestis, result in radical changes in the metabolic flow of carbon. As an important consequence, plague bacilli exhibit a stringent low-calcium response characterized by conversion of L-glutamate (and metabolically related amino acids) to L-aspartate with secretion of the latter into supernatant fluid at 37 degrees C in culture media containing Na(+) but lacking added Ca(2+). This phenomenon also occurs in vivo and likely adversely affects the bioenergetics of host amino acid pools. Curiously, aspartase is functional in all tested enzootic (pestoides) strains of Y. pestis. These isolates are typically restricted to the ancient plague reservoirs of Central Asia and Africa and are fully virulent in members of the rodent Superfamily Muroidea but avirulent in guinea pigs and man. The implications of these findings for the distribution and ecology of Y. pestis could be significant.",M1
20158335,"Study on the movement of Rattus rattus and evaluation of the <e>plague</e> dispersion in Madagascar.Plague affects mainly the rural areas in the central highlands of Madagascar. Rattus rattus is the main rodent host of Yersinia pestis in these localities. Since the introduction of plague, endemic foci have continued to expand, and spatiotemporal variability in the distribution of human plague has been observed. To assess the movements of R. rattus and evaluate the risk of dispersion of the disease, a field study at the scale of the habitats (houses, hedges of sisals, and rice fields) in the plague villages was carried out during high and low seasons of plague transmission to humans. The systemic oral marker Rhodamine B was used to follow rats' movements. Baits were placed in different habitats, and trapping success was carried out once a month for 3 months after the bait distribution. Plague indicators (reservoirs' abundance, flea index, Y. pestis prevalence in fleas, and Y. pestis antibody prevalence in rats) were determined. The highest abundance of rats and marking efficiency were observed in the sisal hedges and the rice fields. Marked rats were captured most commonly near the points where baits were initially placed. The main movements of rats were observed between the houses and sisal hedges. Major differences were observed between the seasons of high and low plague transmission. During the season of low plague transmission, rats were more abundant in the sisal hedges and rice fields, with rats moving from the houses to the rice fields. During the high plague transmission season, rats moved from the hedges of sisal to the rice fields. Important indicators of vector abundance and plague transmission were higher during the high plague transmission season. The three study habitats were the risk areas for plague transmission, but the risk appeared highest in the houses and sisals. Rats' movements according to the season were likely directed by the availability of food.",M1
20158334,"<e>Plague</e> in Mongolia.Mongolia is a country of Central Asia that occupies 1,564,116 km(2) and has a population of 2.7 million people. The geography of Mongolia is varied and has a continental climate. Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is enzootic in wild rodent populations over large rural areas of Mongolia. Natural plague foci have occurred over 28.3% of Mongolia, and 47.1% of these foci are highly active. Highly active plague foci exist mainly in the western part of Mongolia. A total of 27% of all plague cultures were isolated from ectoparasites of 12 species of endemic mammals and 1 species of bird. Most plague cultures isolated from ectoparasites of mammals were from fleas (91.5%). The majority of cultures isolated from fleas were from marmot fleas (64.5% of all fleas). The marmot flea (Oropsylla silantiewi) is considered the primary vector of plague. Human cases of plague have been recorded in Mongolia since 1897 and more than 3000 plague cultures were isolated from natural foci. Plague foci occur between 50 degrees 00-43 degrees 00 longitude and 88 degrees 00-120 degrees 00 latitude and at altitudes between 640 and 3500 m.",M1
20158333,"Modeling susceptible infective recovered dynamics and <e>plague</e> persistence in California rodent-flea communities.Plague persists as an enzootic in several very different rodent-flea communities around the world. In California, a diversity of rodent-flea communities maintains the disease, and a single-host reservoir seems unlikely. Logistic regression of plague presence on climate and topographic variables predicts plague in many localities where it is absent. Thus, a dynamic community-based analysis was needed. Deterministic Susceptible Infective Recovered (SIR) models were adapted for plague and analyzed with an eye for insights concerning disease persistence. An R simulation program, Plaguesirs, was developed incorporating multihost and multivector SIR dynamics, demographic and environmental stochasticity, density dependence, and seasonal variation in birth and death. Flea-rodent utilization matrices allowed us to get transmission rates as well as flea carrying capacities. Rodent densities allowed us to estimate host carrying capacities, while maximum birth rates were mainly approximated through an examination of litter phenology and demography. We ran a set of simulations to assess the role of community structure in maintaining plague in a simulated version of Chuchupate campground in Ventura County. Although the actual campground comprises 10 rodent and 19 flea species, we focused on a subset suspected to act as a reservoir community. This included the vole Microtus californicus, the deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus, the Ceratophyllid fleas Aetheca wagneri and Malareus telchinum, and the Leptopsyllid flea Peromyscopsylla hesperomys. The dynamics of 21 subsets of this community were simulated for 20 years. Single-rodent communities showed much lower disease persistence than two-rodent communities. However, so long as Malareus was present, endemicity was enhanced; removal of the other two fleas slightly increased disease persistence. Two critical features improved disease persistence: (1) host breeding season heterogeneity and (2) host population augmentation (due to two similar host species instead of one). Voles are winter-spring breeders compared to the spring-summer deer mice. While host synchronicity may enhance epidemics, host asynchronicity favors endemics.",M1
20158331,"Rodent and flea abundance fail to predict a <e>plague</e> epizootic in black-tailed prairie dogs.Small rodents are purported to be enzootic hosts of Yersinia pestis and may serve as sources of infection to prairie dogs or other epizootic hosts by direct or flea-mediated transmission. Recent research has shown that small rodent species composition and small rodent flea assemblages are influenced by the presence of prairie dogs, with higher relative abundance of both small rodents and fleas at prairie dog colony sites compared to grasslands without prairie dogs. However, it is unclear if increased rodent or flea abundance predisposes prairie dogs to infection with Y. pestis. We tracked rodent and flea occurrence for 3 years at a number of prairie dog colony sites in Boulder County, Colorado, before, during, and after a local plague epizootic to see if high rodent or flea abundance was associated with plague-affected colonies when compared to colonies that escaped infection. We found no difference in preepizootic rodent abundance or flea prevalence or abundance between plague-positive and plague-negative colonies. Further, we saw no significant before-plague/after-plague change in these metrics at either plague-positive or plague-negative sites. We did, however, find that small rodent species assemblages changed in the year following prairie dog die-offs at plague-affected colonies when compared to unaffected colonies. In light of previous research from this system that has shown that landscape features and proximity to recently plagued colonies are significant predictors of plague occurrence in prairie dogs, we suggest that landscape context is more important to local plague occurrence than are characteristics of rodent or flea species assemblages.",M1
20158330,"Mountain plover responses to <e>plague</e> in Montana.Plague is a bacterial (Yersinia pestis) disease that causes epizootic die-offs in black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) populations in the North American Great Plains. Through their grazing and burrowing, prairie dogs modify vegetation and landscape structure on their colonies in ways that affect other grassland species. Plague epizootics on prairie dog colonies can have indirect effects on species associated with colonies. The mountain plover (Charadrius montanus) preferentially nests on black-tailed prairie dog colonies and is thus negatively impacted by the loss of prairie dogs. We studied the effects of plague and colony spatial characteristics on the occupancy of 81 prairie dog colonies by nesting plovers in Phillips County, Montana, during a 13-year period (1995-2007). We used a robust design patch occupancy model to investigate how colony occupancy and extinction and colonization rates were affected by plague history, colony size, and colony shape. Here extinction and colonization rates refer to the probability that a colony loses/gains plovers in a subsequent nesting season, given that it had/lacked plovers in that breeding season. Colony occupancy was best explained by a model with no annual variation or plague effects. Colony extinction rates were driven by a combination of a quadratic of colony area, a 3-year plague response, and a measure of colony shape. Conversely, colonization rates were best explained by a model with a 4-year plague response. The estimated annual proportion of colonies occupied by plovers was 0.75 (95% confidence interval = 0.57-0.87). Estimated extinction probability ranged from a low of 0.07 (standard error [SE] = 0.02) in 2002 to a high of 0.25 (SE = 0.03) in 1995; colonization probability ranged from 0.24 (SE = 0.05) in 2006 to 0.35 (SE = 0.05) in 2000. Our results highlight how a bird that depends on prairie dogs for nesting habitat responds to plague history and other spatial characteristics of the colony. Ultimately, this information will broaden our understanding of the impact of plague on species other than the host.",M1
20158328,"Vector control improves survival of three species of prairie dogs (Cynomys) in areas considered enzootic for <e>plague</e>.Plague causes periodic epizootics that decimate populations of prairie dogs (PDs) (Cynomys), but the means by which the causative bacterium (Yersinia pestis) persists between epizootics are poorly understood. Plague epizootics in PDs might arise as the result of introductions of Y. pestis from sources outside PD colonies. However, it remains possible that plague persists in PDs during interepizootic periods and is transmitted at low rates among highly susceptible individuals within and between their colonies. If this is true, application of vector control to reduce flea numbers might reduce mortality among PDs. To test whether vector control enhances PD survival in the absence of obvious plague epizootics, we reduced the numbers of fleas (vectors for Y. pestis) 96-98% (1 month posttreatment) on 15 areas involving three species of PDs (Cynomys leucurus, Cynomys parvidens in Utah, and Cynomys ludovicianus in Montana) during 2000-2004 using deltamethrin dust delivered into burrows as a pulicide. Even during years without epizootic plague, PD survival rates at dusted sites were 31-45% higher for adults and 2-34% higher for juveniles compared to survival rates at nondusted sites. Y. pestis was cultured from 49 of the 851 flea pools tested (6882 total fleas) and antibodies against Y. pestis were identified in serum samples from 40 of 2631 PDs. Although other explanations are possible, including transmission of other potentially fatal pathogens by fleas, ticks, or other ectoparasites, our results suggest that plague might be maintained indefinitely in PD populations in the absence of free epizootics and widespread mortality among these animals. If PDs and their fleas support enzootic cycles of plague transmission, there would be important implications for the conservation of these animals and other species.",M1
20158327,"Disease limits populations: <e>plague</e> and black-tailed prairie dogs.Plague is an exotic vector-borne disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis that causes mortality rates approaching 100% in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). We mapped the perimeter of the active portions of black-tailed prairie dog colonies annually between 1999 and 2005 at four prairie dog colony complexes in areas with a history of plague, as well as at two complexes that were located outside the distribution of plague at the time of mapping and had therefore never been affected by the disease. We hypothesized that the presence of plague would significantly reduce overall black-tailed prairie dog colony area, reduce the sizes of colonies on these landscapes, and increase nearest-neighbor distances between colonies. Within the region historically affected by plague, individual colonies were smaller, nearest-neighbor distances were greater, and the proportion of potential habitat occupied by active prairie dog colonies was smaller than at plague-free sites. Populations that endured plague were composed of fewer large colonies (&gt;100 ha) than populations that were historically plague free. We suggest that these differences among sites in colony size and isolation may slow recolonization after extirpation. At the same time, greater intercolony distances may also reduce intercolony transmission of pathogens. Reduced transmission among smaller and more distant colonies may ultimately enhance long-term prairie dog population persistence in areas where plague is present.",M1

The findings are determined by the specific features of the biology and ecology of fleas inhabiting in the natural plague foci of the souslik type in a continental climate area. The specific features include the coincidence of preimago stages and the larger proportion of an adults to rodent nests; the low migration of imagoes from the inhabiting nests to the ground surface, only one insect generation that can develop within a comparatively short (4-5-month) warm period of a year.",M1

20075466,"Visualization of spatiotemporal behavior of discrete maps via generation of recursive median elements.Spatial interpolation is one of the demanding techniques in Geographic Information Science (GISci) to generate interpolated maps in a continuous manner by using two discrete spatial and/or temporal data sets. Noise-free data (thematic layers) depicting a specific theme at varied spatial or temporal resolutions consist of connected components either in aggregated or in disaggregated forms. This short paper provides a simple framework: 1) to categorize the connected components of layered sets of two different time instants through their spatial relationships and the Hausdorff distances between the companion-connected components and 2) to generate sequential maps (interpolations) between the discrete thematic maps. Development of the median set, using Hausdorff erosion and dilation distances to interpolate between temporal frames, is demonstrated on lake geometries mapped at two different times and also on the bubonic <e>plague</e> epidemic spread data available for 11 consecutive years. We documented the significantly fair quality of the median sets generated for epidemic data between alternative years by visually comparing the interpolated maps with actual maps. They can be used to visualize (animate) the spatiotemporal behavior of a specific theme in a continuous sequence.",M1

We describe climatic factors involved in intra- and inter-annual plague dynamics using animal-based surveillance data from that state. Unlike the clear seasonal pattern observed at lower elevations, cases occur randomly throughout the year at higher elevations. Increasing elevation corresponded with delayed mean time in case presentation. Using local meteorological data (previous year mean annual precipitation, total degrees over 27 degrees C 3 years before and maximum winter temperatures 4 years before) we built a time-series model predicting annual case load that explained 75% of the variance in pet cases between years. Moreover, we found a significant correlation with observed annual human cases and predicted pet cases. Because covariates were time-lagged by at least 1 year, intensity of case loads can be predicted in advance of a plague season. Understanding associations between environmental and meteorological factors can be useful for anticipating future disease trends.",M1
20061468,"Genome sequence of the deep-rooted Yersinia pestis strain Angola reveals new insights into the evolution and pangenome of the <e>plague</e> bacterium.To gain insights into the origin and genome evolution of the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis, we have sequenced the deep-rooted strain Angola, a virulent Pestoides isolate. Its ancient nature makes this atypical isolate of particular importance in understanding the evolution of plague pathogenicity. Its chromosome features a unique genetic make-up intermediate between modern Y. pestis isolates and its evolutionary ancestor, Y. pseudotuberculosis. Our genotypic and phenotypic analyses led us to conclude that Angola belongs to one of the most ancient Y. pestis lineages thus far sequenced. The mobilome carries the first reported chimeric plasmid combining the two species-specific virulence plasmids. Genomic findings were validated in virulence assays demonstrating that its pathogenic potential is distinct from modern Y. pestis isolates. Human infection with this particular isolate would not be diagnosed by the standard clinical tests, as Angola lacks the plasmid-borne capsule, and a possible emergence of this genotype raises major public health concerns. To assess the genomic plasticity in Y. pestis, we investigated the global gene reservoir and estimated the pangenome at 4,844 unique protein-coding genes. As shown by the genomic analysis of this evolutionary key isolate, we found that the genomic plasticity within Y. pestis clearly was not as limited as previously thought, which is strengthened by the detection of the largest number of isolate-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) currently reported in the species. This study identified numerous novel genetic signatures, some of which seem to be intimately associated with plague virulence. These markers are valuable in the development of a robust typing system critical for forensic, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies.",M1

It was shown that the strains were highly susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. In the experiments on mice subcutaneously infected with suspension of strains 231 FI+ and 231 FI- of Y. pestis in a dose of about 1000 LD50 (10(4) microbial cells) the ED50 of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin was 5.5-14.0 mg/kg independent of the infective culture phenotype and that of lomefloxacin was 18.5 mg/kg. Estimation of the impact of the pathogen infective dose value on the results of the experimental plague treatment with the therapeutic dose equivalent to the human one showed high efficacy of the fluoroquinolones (efficacy index of 10(4)). The treatment for 7 days provided 90-100-percent survival of the animals. The prophylactive use of lomefloxacin (in 5 hours - 5 days) was less efficient (70-80% of the survivals) in the animals infected with the antigen-changed (FI-) variant of the pathogen. Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin provided 90-100-percent survival of the animals treated for a course of 5 days independent of the pathogen phenotype.

Since iron transport systems are important for iron acquisition from hosts and for survival in the environment, we have analyzed potential iron transport systems encoded by epidemic and non-epidemic or endemic strains of Y. pestis as well as two virulent Y. pseudotuberculosis strains. Computational biology analysis of these genomes showed a high degree of identity/similarity among 16 proven or possible iron/heme transporters identified. Of these, 7 systems were essentially the same in all seven genomes analyzed. The remaining 9 loci had 2-6 genetic variations among these genomes. Two untested, potential siderophore-dependent systems appear intact in Y. pseudotuberculosis but are disrupted or absent in all the endemic Y. pestis strains as well as the epidemic strains from the antiqua and mediaevalis biovars. Only one of these two loci are obviously disrupted in Y. pestis CO92 (epidemic orientalis biovar).

20046111,"[The Antonine <e>Plague</e> and the decline of the Roman Empire]The Antonine Plague, which flared up during the reign of Marcus Aurelius from 165 AD and continued under the rule of his son Commodus, played such a major role that the pathocenosis in the Ancient World was changed. The spread of the epidemic was favoured by the occurrence of two military episodes in which Marcus Aurelius himself took part: the Parthian War in Mesopotamia and the wars against the Marcomanni in northeastern Italy, in Noricum and in Pannonia. Accounts of the clinical features of the epidemic are scant and disjointed, with the main source being Galen, who witnessed the plague. Unfortunately, the great physician provides us with only a brief presentation of the disease, his aim being to supply therapeutic approaches, thus passing over the accurate description of the disease symptoms. Although the reports of some clinical cases treated by Galen lead us to think that the Antonine plague was caused by smallpox, palaeopathological confirmation is lacking. Some archaeological evidence (such as terracotta finds) from Italy might reinforce this opinion. In these finds, some details can be observed, suggesting the artist's purpose to represent the classic smallpox pustules, typical signs of the disease. The extent of the epidemic has been extensively debated: the majority of authors agree that the impact of the plague was severe, influencing military conscription, the agricultural and urban economy, and depleting the coffers of the State. The Antonine plague affected ancient Roman traditions, also leaving a mark on artistic expression; a renewal of spirituality and religiousness was recorded. These events created the conditions for the spread of monotheistic religions, such as Mithraism and Christianity. This period, characterized by health, social and economic crises, paved the way for the entry into the Empire of neighbouring barbarian tribes and the recruitment of barbarian troops into the Roman army; these events particularly favoured the cultural and political growth of these populations. The Antonine Plague may well have created the conditions for the decline of the Roman Empire and, afterwards, for its fall in the West in the fifth century AD.",M1

To identify the autoaggregation factor of Y. pestis, we performed mariner-based transposon mutagenesis. Autoaggregation-defective mutants from three different pools were identified, each with a transposon insertion at a different position within the gene encoding phosphoglucomutase (pgmA; y1258). Targeted deletion of pgmA in Y. pestis KIM5 also resulted in loss of autoaggregation. Given the previously defined role for phosphoglucomutase in antimicrobial peptide resistance in other organisms, we tested the KIM5 DeltapgmA mutant for antimicrobial peptide sensitivity. The DeltapgmA mutant displayed &gt;1,000-fold increased sensitivity to polymyxin B compared to the parental Y. pestis strain, KIM5. This sensitivity is not due to changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) since the LPSs from both Y. pestis KIM5 and the DeltapgmA mutant are identical based on a comparison of their structures by mass spectrometry (MS), tandem MS, and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. Furthermore, the ability of polymyxin B to neutralize LPS toxicity was identical for LPS purified from both KIM5 and the DeltapgmA mutant. Our results indicate that increased polymyxin B sensitivity of the DeltapgmA mutant is due to changes in surface structures other than LPS. Experiments with mice via the intravenous and intranasal routes did not demonstrate any virulence defect for the DeltapgmA mutant, nor was flea colonization or blockage affected. Our findings suggest that the activity of PgmA results in modification and/or elaboration of a surface component of Y. pestis responsible for autoaggregation and polymyxin B resistance.",M1

20027294,"Validation of inverse seasonal peak mortality in medieval <e>plagues</e>, including the Black Death, in comparison to modern Yersinia pestis-variant diseases.BACKGROUND: Recent studies have noted myriad qualitative and quantitative inconsistencies between the medieval Black Death (and subsequent  plagues ) and modern empirical Y. pestis plague data, most of which is derived from the Indian and Chinese plague outbreaks of A.D. 1900+/-15 years. Previous works have noted apparent differences in seasonal mortality peaks during Black Death outbreaks versus peaks of bubonic and pneumonic plagues attributed to Y. pestis infection, but have not provided spatiotemporal statistical support. Our objective here was to validate individual observations of this seasonal discrepancy in peak mortality between historical epidemics and modern empirical data. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compiled and aggregated multiple daily, weekly and monthly datasets of both Y. pestis plague epidemics and suspected Black Death epidemics to compare seasonal differences in mortality peaks at a monthly resolution. Statistical and time series analyses of the epidemic data indicate that a seasonal inversion in peak mortality does exist between known Y. pestis plague and suspected Black Death epidemics. We provide possible explanations for this seasonal inversion. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results add further evidence of inconsistency between historical plagues, including the Black Death, and our current understanding of Y. pestis-variant disease. We expect that the line of inquiry into the disputed cause of the greatest recorded epidemic will continue to intensify. Given the rapid pace of environmental change in the modern world, it is crucial that we understand past lethal outbreaks as fully as possible in order to prepare for future deadly pandemics.",M1
19968786,"YopR impacts type III needle polymerization in Yersinia species.A hallmark of Yersinia type III machines is the presence of needles extending from the bacterial surface. Needles perform two functions, serving as the conduits for the transport of effectors into immune cells but also acting as a sensor. The polymerized needle protein, YscF, is thought to perceive threshold levels of environmental calcium ions to trigger secretion. yopR (yscH) is a gene downstream of yscEFG, encoding the chaperones and principal building blocks of the needle. Here we investigated the contribution of YopR towards type III secretion and pathogenesis. Yersinia pestis KIM D27 mutants lacking yopR were defective for virulence in a mouse model of septicemic <e>plague</e>. yopR variants of Yersinia enterocolitica W22703 displayed a reduced ability to inject effectors into macrophages and required lower calcium concentrations to activate type III secretion than wild-type yersiniae. Furthermore, yopR mutants failed to assemble YscF into needle complexes and instead secreted YscF into the medium. These results imply that YopR may be involved in controlling the secretion of YscF, thereby impacting the assembly of type III machines. An alternative possibility, which YopR participates directly in the polymerization of YscF, seems less likely as YopR is not associated with purified needles.",M1

Using stable nitrogen isotope analysis, we determined that many blood-engorged O. hirsuta collected from wild grasshopper mice apparently contained blood meals of prairie dogs. These results suggest that grasshopper mice may be infected with Y. pestis via mechanisms other than flea feeding, e.g., early phase or mechanical transmission or scavenging carcasses, and raise questions about the ability of grasshopper mice to maintain Y. pestis in prairie dog colonies during years between plague outbreaks. They also indicate that caution may be warranted when inferring feeding relationships based purely on the occurrence of fleas or other haematophagous ectoparasites on hosts. Stable-isotope analysis may complement or provide a useful alternative to immunological or molecular techniques for identifying hosts of cryptically feeding ectoparasites, and for clarifying feeding relationships in studies of host-parasite interactions.",M1

We examined the role of infectious disease in structuring local biodiversity.

These changes in local diversity may be very important, particularly when considered alongside potentially corresponding changes in community structure and function, and we believe that future efforts to understand the importance of disease to species diversity should have an increased focus on these local scales.",M1

The growth of a conditionally virulent pYV-bearing Y. pestis KIM5 in sterile raw ground beef with 7, 15 and 25% fat content was studied at 0, 4, 10 and 25 degrees C. The Y. pestis KIM5 did not grow but survived in raw ground beef at 0 and 4 degrees C. In raw ground beef with fat contents of 7, 15 and 25% Y. pestis KIM5 replicated at 10 degrees C with growth rates of 0.06, 0.05, and 0.06 log(10) CFU/h and maximum population densities of 8.65, 8.30, and 8.43 log(10) CFU/g, respectively.

This suggests that raw ground beef contaminated with virulent Y. pestis could cause oro-pharyngeal <e>plague</e> due to refrigeration failure, temperature (10-25 degrees C) abuse, and if the meat was not properly cooked.

Virulent Y. pestis strains undergo frequent spontaneous deletion of a 102-kb chromosomal DNA fragment, known as the pigmentation (pgm) locus, when grown in laboratory media, yet this locus is present in every virulent isolate. The pgm locus encodes, within a high-pathogenicity island, siderophore biosynthesis genes that are required for growth in the mammalian host when inoculated by peripheral routes. Recently, higher challenge doses of nonpigmented Y. pestis were reported to cause fatal pneumonic plague in mice, suggesting a useful model for studies of virulence and immunity. In this work, we show that intranasal infection of BALB/c mice with nonpigmented Yersinia pestis does not result in pneumonic plague. Despite persistent bacterial colonization of the lungs and the eventual death of infected mice, pulmonary inflammation was generally absent, and there was no disease pathology characteristic of pneumonic plague. Iron given to mice at the time of challenge, previously shown to enhance the virulence of pgm-deficient strains, resulted in an accelerated disease course, with less time to bacteremia and lethality, but lung inflammation and pneumonia were still absent. We examined other rodent models and found differences in lung inflammatory responses, some of which led to clearance and survival even when high challenge doses were used. Together, the results suggest that the Y. pestis pgm locus encodes previously unappreciated virulence factors required for the induction of pneumonic plague that are independent of iron scavenging from the mammalian host.",M1

Because of the disease's inherent communicability, rapid clinical course, and high mortality, it is critical that an outbreak, whether it is natural or deliberate, be detected and diagnosed quickly. The objective of this research was to generate a recombinant luxAB ( light )-tagged reporter phage that can detect Y. pestis by rapidly and specifically conferring a bioluminescent signal response to these cells. The bacterial luxAB reporter genes were integrated into a noncoding region of the CDC plague-diagnostic phage phiA1122 by homologous recombination. The identity and fitness of the recombinant phage were assessed through PCR analysis and lysis assays and functionally verified by the ability to transduce a bioluminescent signal to recipient cells. The reporter phage conferred a bioluminescent phenotype to Y. pestis within 12 min of infection at 28 degrees C. The signal response time and signal strength were dependent on the number of cells present. A positive signal was obtained from 10(2) cells within 60 min. A signal response was not detectable with Escherichia coli, although a weak signal (100-fold lower than that with Y. pestis) was obtained with 1 (of 10) Yersinia enterocolitica strains and 2 (of 10) Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains at the restrictive temperature. Importantly, serum did not prevent the ability of the reporter phage to infect Y. pestis, nor did it significantly quench the resulting bioluminescent signal. Collectively, the results indicate that the reporter phage displays promise for the rapid and specific diagnostic detection of cultivated Y. pestis isolates or infected clinical specimens.",M1

19815894,"Flea diversity and infestation prevalence on rodents in a <e>plague</e>-endemic region of Uganda.In Uganda, the West Nile region is the primary epidemiologic focus for plague. The aims of this study were to 1) describe flea-host associations within a plague-endemic region of Uganda, 2) compare flea loads between villages with or without a history of reported human plague cases and between sampling periods, and 3) determine vector loads on small mammal hosts in domestic, peridomestic, and sylvatic settings. We report that the roof rat, Rattus rattus, is the most common rodent collected in human dwellings in each of the 10 villages within the two districts sampled. These rats were commonly infested with efficient Y. pestis vectors, Xenopsylla cheopis and X. brasiliensis in Arua and Nebbi districts, respectively. In peridomestic and sylvatic areas in both districts, the Nile rat, Arvicanthus niloticus, was the most abundant rodent and hosted the highest diversity of flea species. When significant temporal differences in flea loads were detected, they were typically lower during the dry month of January. We did not detect any significant differences in small mammal abundance or flea loads between villages with our without a history of human plague, indicating that conditions during inter-epizootic periods are similar between these areas. Future studies are needed to determine whether flea abundance or species composition changes during epizootics when humans are most at risk of exposure.",M1
19815893,"Spatial variation of Yersinia pestis from Yunnan Province of China.Yunnan Province of China is considered the site of origin for modern <e>plague</e>. We analyzed the genotypes of eight Yersinia pestis strains isolated from three counties in Yunnan Province by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE showed that strains isolated from the same site were identical regardless of hosts or year of isolation. However, Y. pestis strains isolated from geographically distinct loci were genetically divergent. Whole genome sequences of two strains from two foci in Yunnan showed that the genetic variation of Y. pestis strains was caused by genome rearrangement. We concluded that Y. pestis strains in each epidemic focus in Yunnan were a clonal population and selected by host environments. The genomic variability of the Y. pestis strains from different foci were caused by genome rearrangement, which may provide a positive selective advantage for Y. pestis to adapt to its host environments.",M1
19775435,"MLVA distribution characteristics of Yersinia pestis in China and the correlation analysis.BACKGROUND: Yersinia pestis, the aetiological agent of <e>plague</e>, has been well defined genotypically on local and worldwide scales. In November 2005, five cases of severe pneumonia of unknown causes, resulting in two deaths, were reported in Yulong, Yunnan province. In this study, we compared Y. pestis isolated from the Yulong focus to strains from other areas. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirteen Y. pestis strains collected from different plague foci in China and a live attenuated vaccine strain of Y. pestis (EV76) were genotyped using multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) on 14 loci. A total of 214 Y. pestis strains were divided into 85 MLVA types, and Nei's genetic diversity indices of the various loci ranged between 0.02 - 0.76. Minimum spanning tree analysis showed that Y. pestis in China could be divided into six complexes. It was observed that Microtus strains were different from the other three biovar strains. Each plague focus had its own unique MLVA types. CONCLUSION: The strains isolated from Yulong, Yunnan province had a unique MLVA type, indicating a new clone group. Our results suggest that Yulong strains may have a close relationship with strains from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau plague focus.",M1
19759820,"The NlpD lipoprotein is a novel Yersinia pestis virulence factor essential for the development of <e>plague</e>.Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague. Previously we have isolated an attenuated Y. pestis transposon insertion mutant in which the pcm gene was disrupted. In the present study, we investigated the expression and the role of pcm locus genes in Y. pestis pathogenesis using a set of isogenic surE, pcm, nlpD and rpoS mutants of the fully virulent Kimberley53 strain. We show that in Y. pestis, nlpD expression is controlled from elements residing within the upstream genes surE and pcm. The NlpD lipoprotein is the only factor encoded from the pcm locus that is essential for Y. pestis virulence. A chromosomal deletion of the nlpD gene sequence resulted in a drastic reduction in virulence to an LD(50) of at least 10(7) cfu for subcutaneous and airway routes of infection. The mutant was unable to colonize mouse organs following infection. The filamented morphology of the nlpD mutant indicates that NlpD is involved in cell separation; however, deletion of nlpD did not affect in vitro growth rate. Trans-complementation experiments with the Y. pestis nlpD gene restored virulence and all other phenotypic defects. Finally, we demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of the nlpD mutant could protect animals against bubonic and primary pneumonic plague. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Y. pestis NlpD is a novel virulence factor essential for the development of bubonic and pneumonic plague. Further, the nlpD mutant is superior to the EV76 prototype live vaccine strain in immunogenicity and in conferring effective protective immunity. Thus it could serve as a basis for a very potent live vaccine against bubonic and pneumonic plague.",M1
19734471,"Innate immune response during Yersinia infection: critical modulation of cell death mechanisms through phagocyte activation.Yersinia pestis, the etiological agent of <e>plague</e>, is one of the most deadly pathogens on our planet. This organism shares important attributes with its ancestral progenitor, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, including a 70-kb virulence plasmid, lymphotropism during growth in the mammalian host, and killing of host macrophages. Infections with both organisms are biphasic, where bacterial replication occurs initially with little inflammation, followed by phagocyte influx, inflammatory cytokine production, and tissue necrosis. During infection, plasmid-encoded attributes facilitate bacterial-induced macrophage death, which results from two distinct processes and corresponds to the inflammatory crescendo observed in vivo: Naïve cells die by apoptosis (noninflammatory), and later in infection, activated macrophages die by pyroptosis (inflammatory). The significance of this redirected cell death for the host is underscored by the importance of phagocyte activation for immunity to Yersinia and the protective role of pyroptosis during host responses to anthrax lethal toxin and infections with Francisella, Legionella, Pseudomonas, and Salmonella. The similarities of Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis, including conserved, plasmid-encoded functions inducing at least two distinct mechanisms of cell death, indicate that comparative studies are revealing about their critical pathogenic mechanism(s) and host innate immune responses during infection. Validation of this idea and evidence of similar interactions with the host immune system are provided by Y. pseudotuberculosis-priming, cross-protective immunity against Y. pestis. Despite these insights, additional studies indicate much remains to be understood concerning effective host responses against Yersinia, including chromosomally encoded attributes that also contribute to bacterial evasion and modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses.",M1
19718822,"[The autoagglutination factor of <e>plague</e> pathogen--cross-reacting antigen]An antigen similar to the autoagglutination factor (AF) of plague pathogen in immunochemical specificity was sought in 22 bacterial species. For this, an immunoglobulin anti-AF diagnosticum that is the sheep erythrocytes sensitized with rabbit immune serum to the AF preparation isolated from the plasmid-free variant of the Yersinia pestis strain EV76. The bacteriological study applying a passive hemagglutination assay revealed AF-like antigens not only in all study strains (n = 30) of Y. pestis, but also in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris. These bacteria were used to prepare AF = like antigen preparations that reacted with rabbit anti-AF serum in dot blot immunoassay. Also, as Y. pestis, AF-like antigens in polyacrylamide gel were detected as multiple protein bands that differed in mobility in Yersiniae and heterologous bacteria. Differences were found in the properties of AF-line antigens of 5 species of bacteria (sensitivity to temperature and formalin, binding to the cell surface, which enabled differentiation of serological reactions caused by AP-like antigens of other bacteria. Thus, Y. pestis AF is a cross-reacting antigen that, despite its immunochemical similarity with AF-like antigens of other bacteria, was ascertained to differ from them in properties. The findings are of interest for searching for new diagnostic tests to detect the Cafl- strains of the plague pathogen and for differentiating the causative organisms of plague and pseudotuberculosis.",M1

A T6SS of Yersinia pestis CO92 (locus YPO0499-YPO0516) was deleted followed by investigation of the phenotype of this mutation. We observed that this T6SS locus of Y. pestis was preferentially expressed at 26 degrees C in comparison to 37 degrees C suggesting a possible role in the flea cycle. However, we found that the deletion of T6SS locus YPO0499-YPO0516 in Y. pestis CO92 had no effect on the ability of this strain to infect the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis. Nevertheless, this mutant displayed increased intracellular numbers in macrophage-like J774.A1 cells after 20 h post-infection for bacterial cells pre-grown at 26 degrees C indicating that expression of this T6SS locus limited intracellular replication in macrophages. In addition, deletion of the YPO0499-YPO0516 locus reduced the uptake by macrophages of the Y. pestis mutant pre-grown at 37 degrees C, suggesting that this T6SS locus has phagocytosis-promoting activity. Further study of the virulence of the T6SS mutant in murine bubonic and inhalation <e>plague</e> models revealed no attenuation in comparison with the parental CO92 strain.",M1
19716148,"Human <e>plague</e> occurrences in Africa: an overview from 1877 to 2008.Plague remains a public health concern worldwide, but particularly in Africa. Despite the long-standing history of human plague, it is difficult to get a historical and recent overview of the general situation. We searched and screened available information sources on human plague occurrences in African countries and compiled information on when, where and how many cases occurred in a centralised database. We found records that plague was probably already present before the third pandemic and that hundreds of thousands of human infections have been reported in 26 countries since 1877. In the first 30 years of the 20th century, the number of human cases steadily increased to reach a maximum in 1929. From then on the number decreased and fell below 250 after 1945. Since the 1980s, again increasingly more human infections have been reported with the vast majority of cases notified in East Africa and Madagascar. We show that public health concerns regarding the current plague situation are justified and that the disease should not be neglected, despite the sometimes questionability of the numbers of cases. We conclude that improving plague surveillance strategies is absolutely necessary to obtain a clear picture of the plague situation in endemic regions.",M1
19714987,"Typing methods for the <e>plague</e> pathogen, Yersinia pestis.Phenotypic and genotypic methodologies have been used to differentiate the etiological agent of plague, Yersinia pestis. Historically, phenotypic methods were used to place isolates into one of three biovars based on nitrate reduction and glycerol fermentation. Classification of Y. pestis into genetic subtypes is problematic due to the relative monomorphic nature of the pathogen. Resolution into groups is dependent on the number and types of loci used in the analysis. The last 5-10 years of research and analysis in the field of Y. pestis genotyping have resulted in a recognition by Western scientists that two basic types of Y. pestis exist. One type, considered to be classic strains that are able to cause human plague transmitted by the normal flea vector, is termed epidemic strains. The other type does not typically cause human infections by normal routes of infection, but is virulent for rodents and is termed endemic strains. Previous classification schemes used outside the Western hemisphere referred to these latter strains as Pestoides varieties of Y. pestis. Recent molecular analysis has definitely shown that both endemic and epidemic strains arose independently from a common Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ancestor. Currently, 11 major groups of Y. pestis are defined globally.",M1
19710295,"Yersinia pestis can bypass protective antibodies to LcrV and activation with gamma interferon to survive and induce apoptosis in murine macrophages.Yersinia pestis, the agent of <e>plague</e>, uses a type III secretion injectisome to deliver Yop proteins into macrophages to counteract phagocytosis and induce apoptosis. Additionally, internalized Y. pestis can survive in the phagosomes of naïve or gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-activated macrophages by blocking vacuole acidification. The Y. pestis LcrV protein is a target of protective antibodies. The binding of antibodies to LcrV at the injectisome tip results in neutralization of the apoptosis of Y. pestis-infected macrophages and is used as an in vitro correlate of protective immunity. The cytokines IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha can cooperate with anti-LcrV to promote protection against lethal Y. pestis infection in mice. It is not known if these phagocyte-activating cytokines cooperate with anti-LcrV to increase the killing of the pathogen and decrease apoptosis in macrophages. We investigated how anti-LcrV and IFN-gamma impact bacterial survival and apoptosis in cultured murine macrophages infected with Y. pestis KIM5. Y. pestis KIM5 opsonized with polyclonal or monoclonal anti-LcrV was used to infect macrophages treated with or without IFN-gamma. The phagocytosis and survival of KIM5 and the apoptosis of macrophages were measured at different time points postinfection. The results show that anti-LcrV reduced apoptosis at an early time point (5 h) but not at a later time point (24 h). Polyclonal anti-LcrV was unable to inhibit apoptosis at either time point in IFN-gamma-activated macrophages. Additionally, anti-LcrV was ineffective at promoting the killing of KIM5 in naïve or activated macrophages. We conclude that Y. pestis can bypass protective antibodies to LcrV and activation with IFN-gamma to survive and induce apoptosis in murine macrophages.",M1

It was demonstrated that strains from the Gorno-Altaisk population of plague microbes possessed genomic polymorphism in the locus given a marker that is reflected in variability of the size of an amplicon from 250 up to 275 bp, correlating with places of isolation of strains in separate epizootic loci. Strains Y. pestis ssp. pestis from the Tuva population, on the contrary, are characterized by conservatism in the locus 5'-NAAA-3' (the size of an amplicon was 261 bp).

The available medical literature describing the sequence of signs and symptoms of pneumonic plague reveals that, during the earliest stages, patients will most likely present with certain gastrointestinal and minimal, if any, respiratory signs. Without this knowledge, early evidence of pneumonic plague in syndromic surveillance systems may be missed until the respiratory signs become prevalent. Because plague is a zoonotic disease, new syndromic surveillance systems that use animal data from park rangers and veterinarians may provide useful evidence. This paper shows how a review of both human and animal literature can be used to design queries for syndromic surveillance systems.",M1
19645275,"Studies of vector competency and efficiency of North American fleas for Yersinia pestis: state of the field and future research needs.The etiological agent of <e>plague</e>, Yersinia pestis, is most commonly transmitted by the bite of infectious fleas. To date, at least 28 flea species occurring in North America have been experimentally confirmed as vectors of Y. pestis. Transmission efficiency differs among species and also between different studies of a single species. These differences may, however, in large part reflect nonstandardized experimental conditions used during the first half of the 20th century when such studies were conducted in response to the rapid spread of Y. pestis across the western United States after its introduction at the beginning of this century. The majority of these early transmission studies focused on the blocked flea mechanism of transmission, which typically does not occur until &gt; 2-3 wk after the flea becomes infected. Recent studies have challenged the paradigm that Y. pestis is usually spread by blocked fleas by demonstrating that numerous flea species, including the oriental rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis, which was the focus of the early classical studies on blocked flea transmission, are capable of early-phase  transmission during the first few days after becoming infected and before a complete blockage can form. The aims of this review are to 1) summarize Y. pestis vector competency and efficiency studies for fleas occurring in North America, 2) discuss the implications of the results of these studies for our understanding of the dynamics of plague epizootics, 3) demonstrate why older transmission studies need to be repeated using a standardized experimental system, and 4) outline future directions for studies of fleas as vectors of Y. pestis.",M1
19629028,"Bubonic and pneumonic <e>plague</e> - Uganda, 2006.Plague is a life-threatening fleaborne disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The most common clinical form is bubonic plague, which is characterized by high fever and regional lymphadenitis. Without treatment, infection can spread from lymph nodes to the lungs, resulting in pneumonic plague and the potential for person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets. In November 2006, the Uganda Ministry of Health received reports of an increase in bubonic plague cases and a possible outbreak of pneumonic plague among residents in the Arua and Nebbi districts. In response, the Uganda Ministry of Health and CDC conducted a joint investigation in the two districts during November 28-December 30, 2006. Overall, 127 clinical plague cases were identified, along with evidence of a focal pneumonic outbreak in Nebbi District. Median age of the patients was 14 years (range: 2 weeks-65 years); 65 (51%) were female. Twenty-eight (22%) of the 127 patients died. Among the 102 patients with documented symptoms, 90 (88%) had bubonic plague, and 12 (12%) had pneumonic plague. The results of this investigation underscore the need to 1) continue efforts to educate residents of rural Uganda regarding the source, signs, and symptoms of plague and the life-saving importance of seeking treatment; 2) strengthen plague surveillance and diagnostic capabilities; and 3) improve emergency response and vector-control capacity, especially in remote regions of the country.",M1
19620344,"D27-pLpxL, an avirulent strain of Yersinia pestis, primes T cells that protect against pneumonic <e>plague</e>.Vaccinating with live, conditionally attenuated, pigmentation (Pgm)-deficient Yersinia pestis primes T cells that protect mice against pneumonic plague. However, Pgm-deficient strains are not considered safe for human use because they retain substantial virulence in animal models. Y. pestis strains engineered to express Escherichia coli LpxL are avirulent owing to constitutive production of lipopolysaccharide with increased Toll-like receptor 4-activating ability. We generated an LpxL-expressing Pgm-deficient strain (D27-pLpxL) and demonstrate here that this avirulent strain retains the capacity to prime protective T cells. Compared with unvaccinated controls, mice immunized intranasally with live D27-pLpxL exhibit a decreased bacterial burden and increased survival when challenged intranasally with virulent Y. pestis. T cells provide a substantial degree of this protection, as vaccine efficacy is maintained in B-cell-deficient muMT mice unless those animals are depleted of CD4 and CD8 T cells at the time of challenge. Upon challenge with Y. pestis, pulmonary T-cell numbers decline in naive mice, whereas immunized mice show increased numbers of CD44(high) CD43(high) effector T cells and T cells primed to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha and gamma interferon; neutralizing these cytokines at the time of challenge abrogates protection. Immunization does not prevent dissemination of Y. pestis from the lung but limits bacterial growth and pathology in visceral tissue, apparently by facilitating formation of granuloma-like structures. This study describes a new model for studying T-cell-mediated protection against pneumonic plague and demonstrates the capacity for live, highly attenuated, Y. pestis vaccine strains to prime protective memory T-cell responses safely.",M1
19609450,"In vitro intracellular trafficking of virulence antigen during infection by Yersinia pestis.Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of <e>plague</e>, encodes several essential virulence factors on a 70 kb plasmid, including the Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) and a multifunctional virulence antigen (V). V is uniquely able to inhibit the host immune response; aid in the expression, secretion, and injection of the cytotoxic Yops via a type III secretion system (T3SS)-dependent mechanism; be secreted extracellularly; and enter the host cell by a T3SS-independent mechanism, where its activity is unknown. To elucidate the intracellular trafficking and target(s) of V, time-course experiments were performed with macrophages (MPhis) infected with Y. pestis or Y. pseudotuberculosis at intervals from 5 min to 6 h. The trafficking pattern was discerned from results of parallel microscopy, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry experiments. The MPhis were incubated with fluorescent or gold conjugated primary or secondary anti-V (antibodies [Abs]) in conjunction with organelle-associated Abs or dyes. The samples were observed for co-localization by immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy. For fractionation studies, uninfected and infected MPhis were lysed and subjected to density gradient centrifugation coupled with immunoblotting with Abs to V or to organelles. Samples were also analyzed by flow cytometry after lysis and dual-staining with anti-V and anti-organelle Abs. Our findings indicate a co-localization of V with (1) endosomal proteins between 10-45 min of infection, (2) lysosomal protein(s) between 1-2 h of infection, (3) mitochondrial proteins between 2.5-3 h infection, and (4) Golgi protein(s) between 4-6 h of infection.

In this report, we characterized the virulence of strains from which the plasminogen activating protease (pla)-encoding pPCP1 plasmid was cured from either the wild-type (WT) or the Deltalpp mutant strain of Y. pestis CO92 in the mouse model of pneumonic infection. We noted a significantly increased survival rate in mice infected with the Y. pestis pPCP(-)/Deltalpp mutant strain up to a dose of 5000 LD(50). Additionally, mice challenged with the pPCP(-)/Deltalpp strain had substantially less tissue injury and a strong decrease in the levels of most cytokines and chemokines in tissue homogenates and sera when compared with the WT-infected group. Importantly, the Y. pestis pPCP(-)/Deltalpp mutant strain was detectable in high numbers in the livers and spleens of some of the infected mice. In the lungs of pPCP(-)/Deltalpp mutant-challenged animals, however, bacterial numbers dropped at 48 h after infection when compared with tissue homogenates from 1 h post-infection. Similarly, we noted that this mutant was unable to survive within murine macrophages in an in vitro assay, whereas survivability of the pPCP(-) mutant within the macrophage environment was similar to that of the WT. Taken together, our data indicated that a significant and possibly synergistic attenuation in bacterial virulence occurred in a mouse model of pneumonic plague when both the lpp gene and the virulence plasmid pPCP1 encoding the pla gene were deleted from Y. pestis.",M1
19584125,"Correlates of environmental factors and human <e>plague</e>: an ecological study in Vietnam.BACKGROUND: Human plague caused by Yersinia pestis remains a public health threat in endemic countries, because the disease is associated with increased risk of mortality and severe economic and social consequences. During the past 10 years, outbreaks of plague have occasionally occurred in Vietnam's Central Highlands region. The present study sought to describe and analyse the occurrence of plague and its association with ecological factors. METHODS: The study included all 510 communes of the Central Highlands region (with a total population of approximately 4 million) where 95% of incidence of plague cases in Vietnam had been reported from 1997 through 2002. Plague was clinically ascertained by using a standard protocol by WHO. Data on domestic fleas and rodents were obtained by using traps and periodic surveillance in accordance with the WHO guidelines. Temperature, duration of sunshine, rainfall and humidity were recorded as monthly averages by local meteorological stations. The association between these ecological factors and plague was assessed by using the Poisson regression model. RESULTS: From 1997 through 2002, 472 cases of plague were reported, of whom 24 (5.1%) died. The incidence of plague peaked during the dry season, with approximately 63% of cases occurring from February through April. The risk of plague occurrence was associated with an increased monthly flea index (RR and 95% CI: 1.93; 1.61-2.33 for months with the flea index &gt;1) and increased rodent density (RR 1.23; 1.15-1.32 per each 3% increase in density). Moreover, the risk of plague increased during the dry season (RR 2.07; 1.64-2.62), when rainfall fell &lt;10 mm (RR 1.44; 1.17-1.77). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the flea index, rodent density and rainfall could be used as ecological indicators of plague risk in Vietnam. The data also suggest that the occurrence of plague in Vietnam's Central Highlands is likely resulted from multiple causes that remain to be delineated.",M1
19581396,"Gr1+ cells control growth of YopM-negative yersinia pestis during systemic <e>plague</e>.YopM, a protein toxin of Yersinia pestis, is necessary for virulence in a mouse model of systemic plague. We previously reported YopM-dependent natural killer (NK) cell depletion from blood and spleen samples of infected mice. However, in this study we found that infection with Y. pestis KIM5 (YopM(+)) caused depletion of NK cells in the spleen, but not in the liver, and antibody-mediated ablation of NK cells had no effect on bacterial growth. There was no YopM-associated effect on the percentage of dendritic cells (DCs) or polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in the early stage of infection; however, there was a YopM-associated effect on PMN integrity and on the influx of monocytes into the spleen. Ablation of Gr1(+) cells caused loss of the growth defect of YopM(-) Y. pestis in both the liver and spleen. In contrast, ablation of macrophages/DCs inhibited growth of both parent and mutant bacteria, accompanied by significantly fewer lesion sites in the liver. These results point toward PMNs and inflammatory monocytes as major cell types that control growth of YopM(-) Y. pestis. Infection with fully virulent Y. pestis CO92 and a YopM(-) derivative by intradermal and intranasal routes showed that the absence of YopM significantly increased the 50% lethal dose only in the intradermal model, suggesting a role for YopM in bubonic plague, in which acute inflammation occurs soon after infection.",M1

Among them, VW+ strains of Y. pestis accounted for 95.13% (391/411), VW-accounted for 4.87% (20/411), Pgm(+) accounted for 80.78% (332/ 411), Pgm(+/-) accounted for 9% (37/411) and Pgm(-) accounted for 10.22% (42/411) respectively. 96.82% (213/220) of the Y. pestis strains showed strong virulence to laboratory mice while 3.18% (7/220) of the strains carried medium virulence. 90.02% of the tested Y. pestis (370/411) strains had 6 x10(6), 45 x 10(6), 65 x 10(6) plasmids. 8 types of genome were found among 80 strains of Y. pestis, with 6 of them resembling ZHOU Dongsheng' s classification. Two new genome types were found. CONCLUSION: The Y. pestis in the Sanjiangyuan area had the characteristics of plague pathogen, identified in Qinghai-Tibet plateau. It is estimated that human beings are highly susceptible to the disease which spread fast, causing serious signs and symptoms with high death rate.",M1
19560967,"Modelling the black death. A historical case study and implications for the epidemiology of bubonic <e>plague</e>.We analysed a plague outbreak in the mining town of Freiberg in Saxony which started in May 1613 and ended in February 1614. This epidemic was selected for study because of the high quality of contemporary sources. It was possible to identify 1400 individual victims meaning that more than 10% of the population of the city perished. The outbreak was modelled by 9 differential equations describing flea, rat, and human populations. This resulted in a close fit to the historical records of this outbreak. An interesting implication of the model is that the introduction of even a small number of immune rats into an otherwise unchanged setting results in an abortive outbreak with very few human victims. Hence, the percentage of immune rats directly influences the magnitude of a human epidemic by diverting search activities of the fleas. Thus, we conclude that the spread of Rattus norvegicus, which might acquire partial herd immunity by exposure to soil- or water-borne Yersinia species due to its preference for wet habitats, contributed to the disappearance of Black Death epidemics from Europe in the 18th century. In order to prove whether or not the parameter values obtained by fitting a given outbreak are also applicable to other cases, we modelled the plague outbreak in Bombay 1905/06 using the same parameter values except for the number of humans as well as of immune and susceptible rats.",M1
19558717,"Spatial analysis of <e>plague</e> in California: niche modeling predictions of the current distribution and potential response to climate change.BACKGROUND: Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is a public and wildlife health concern in California and the western United States. This study explores the spatial characteristics of positive plague samples in California and tests Maxent, a machine-learning method that can be used to develop niche-based models from presence-only data, for mapping the potential distribution of plague foci. Maxent models were constructed using geocoded seroprevalence data from surveillance of California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) as case points and Worldclim bioclimatic data as predictor variables, and compared and validated using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) statistics. Additionally, model results were compared to locations of positive and negative coyote (Canis latrans) samples, in order to determine the correlation between Maxent model predictions and areas of plague risk as determined via wild carnivore surveillance. RESULTS: Models of plague activity in California ground squirrels, based on recent climate conditions, accurately identified case locations (AUC of 0.913 to 0.948) and were significantly correlated with coyote samples. The final models were used to identify potential plague risk areas based on an ensemble of six future climate scenarios. These models suggest that by 2050, climate conditions may reduce plague risk in the southern parts of California and increase risk along the northern coast and Sierras. CONCLUSION: Because different modeling approaches can yield substantially different results, care should be taken when interpreting future model predictions. Nonetheless, niche modeling can be a useful tool for exploring and mapping the potential response of plague activity to climate change. The final models in this study were used to identify potential plague risk areas based on an ensemble of six future climate scenarios, which can help public managers decide where to allocate surveillance resources. In addition, Maxent model results were significantly correlated with coyote samples, indicating that carnivore surveillance programs will continue to be important for tracking the response of plague to future climate conditions.",M1
19555287,"Primary pneumonic <e>plague</e> contracted from a mountain lion carcass.BACKGROUND: Primary pneumonic plague is a rare but often fatal form of Yersinia pestis infection that results from direct inhalation of bacteria and is potentially transmissible from person to person. We describe a case of primary pneumonic plague in a wildlife biologist who was found deceased in his residence 1 week after conducting a necropsy on a mountain lion. METHODS: To determine cause of death, a postmortem examination was conducted, and friends and colleagues were interviewed. Physical evidence was reviewed, including specimens from the mountain lion and the biologist's medical chart, camera, and computer. Human and animal tissues were submitted for testing. Persons in close contact (within 2 meters) to the biologist after he had developed symptoms were identified and offered chemoprophylaxis. RESULTS: The biologist conducted the necropsy in his garage without the use of personal protective equipment. Three days later, he developed fever and hemoptysis and died approximately 6 days after exposure. Gross examination showed consolidation and hemorrhagic fluid in the lungs; no buboes were noted. Plague was diagnosed presumptively by polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by culture. Tissues from the mountain lion tested positive for Y. pestis, and isolates from the biologist and mountain lion were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Among 49 contacts who received chemoprophylaxis, none developed symptoms consistent with plague. CONCLUSIONS: The biologist likely acquired pneumonic plague through inhalation of aerosols generated during postmortem examination of an infected mountain lion. Enhanced awareness of zoonotic diseases and appropriate use of personal protective equipment are needed for biologists and others who handle wildlife.",M1
19543392,"Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of Yersinia pestis by MLVA: insights into the worldwide expansion of Central Asia <e>plague</e> foci.BACKGROUND: The species Yersinia pestis is commonly divided into three classical biovars, Antiqua, Medievalis, and Orientalis, belonging to subspecies pestis pathogenic for human and the (atypical) non-human pathogenic biovar Microtus (alias Pestoides) including several non-pestis subspecies. Recent progress in molecular typing methods enables large-scale investigations in the population structure of this species. It is now possible to test hypotheses about its evolution which were proposed decades ago. For instance the three classical biovars of different geographical distributions were suggested to originate from Central Asia. Most investigations so far have focused on the typical pestis subspecies representatives found outside of China, whereas the understanding of the emergence of this human pathogen requires the investigation of strains belonging to subspecies pestis from China and to the Microtus biovar. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Multi-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) with 25 loci was performed on a collection of Y. pestis isolates originating from the majority of the known foci worldwide and including typical rhamnose-negative subspecies pestis as well as rhamnose-positive subspecies pestis and biovar Microtus. More than 500 isolates from China, the Former Soviet Union (FSU), Mongolia and a number of other foci around the world were characterized and resolved into 350 different genotypes. The data revealed very close relationships existing between some isolates from widely separated foci as well as very high diversity which can conversely be observed between nearby foci. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results obtained are in full agreement with the view that the Y. pestis subsp. pestis pathogenic for humans emerged in the Central Asia region between China, Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia, only three clones of which spread out of Central Asia. The relationships among the strains in China, Central Asia and the rest of the world based on the MLVA25 assay provide an unprecedented view on the expansion and microevolution of Y. pestis.",M1

19529770,"Yersinia pestis endowed with increased cytotoxicity is avirulent in a bubonic <e>plague</e> model and induces rapid protection against pneumonic plague.An important virulence strategy evolved by bacterial pathogens to overcome host defenses is the modulation of host cell death. Previous observations have indicated that Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague disease, exhibits restricted capacity to induce cell death in macrophages due to ineffective translocation of the type III secretion effector YopJ, as opposed to the readily translocated YopP, the YopJ homologue of the enteropathogen Yersinia enterocolitica Oratio8. This led us to suggest that reduced cytotoxic potency may allow pathogen propagation within a shielded niche, leading to increased virulence. To test the relationship between cytotoxic potential and virulence, we replaced Y. pestis YopJ with YopP. The YopP-expressing Y. pestis strain exhibited high cytotoxic activity against macrophages in vitro. Following subcutaneous infection, this strain had reduced ability to colonize internal organs, was unable to induce septicemia and exhibited at least a 10(7)-fold reduction in virulence. Yet, upon intravenous or intranasal infection, it was still as virulent as the wild-type strain. The subcutaneous administration of the cytotoxic Y. pestis strain appears to activate a rapid and potent systemic, CTL-independent, immunoprotective response, allowing the organism to overcome simultaneous coinfection with 10,000 LD(50) of virulent Y. pestis. Moreover, three days after subcutaneous administration of this strain, animals were also protected against septicemic or primary pneumonic plague. Our findings indicate that an inverse relationship exists between the cytotoxic potential of Y. pestis and its virulence following subcutaneous infection. This appears to be associated with the ability of the engineered cytotoxic Y. pestis strain to induce very rapid, effective and long-lasting protection against bubonic and pneumonic plague. These observations have novel implications for the development of vaccines/therapies against Y. pestis and shed new light on the virulence strategies of Y. pestis in nature.",M1

The genome of basic subspecies of plague infection agent species strain contains 3 different variants: intact genes, genes with IS-element inserts, or individual fragments. The pseudogene profile can be used as genetic marker of the Y. Pestis strains of basic subspecies from natural foci of plague. Strains of supplementary subspecies of Y. Pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis contain these genes as the wild-type gene alleles. In addition to other factors, this fact can be regarded as evidence of ancient origin of plague infection agent supplementary subspecies and their similarity to pseudotuberculosis infection agent.",M1
19502688,"A review of <e>plague</e> persistence with special emphasis on fleas.Sylvatic plague is highly prevalent during infrequent epizootics that ravage the landscape of western North America. During these periods, plague dissemination is very efficient. Epizootics end when rodent and flea populations are decimated and vectored transmission declines. A second phase (enzootic plague) ensues when plague is difficult to detect from fleas, hosts or the environment, and presents less of a threat to public health. Recently, researchers have hypothesized that the bacterium (Yersinia pestis) responsible for plague maintains a continuous state of high virulence and thus only changes in transmission efficiency explain the shift between alternating enzootic and epizootic phases. However, if virulent transmission becomes too inefficient, strong selection might favor an alternate survival strategy. Another plausible non-exclusive hypothesis, best supported from Asian field studies, is that Y. pestis persists (locally) at foci by maintaining a more benign relationship within adapted rodents during the long expanses of time between outbreaks. From this vantage, it can revert to the epizootic (transmission efficient) form. Similarly, in the United States (US), enzootic plague persistence has been proposed to develop sequestered within New World rodent carriers. However, the absence of clear support for rodent carriers in North America has encouraged a broader search for alternative explanations. A telluric plague existence has been proposed. However, the availability of flea life stages and their hosts could critically supplement environmental plague sources, or fleas might directly represent a lowlevel plague reservoir. Here, we note a potentially pivotal role for fleas. These epizootic plague vectors should be closely studied with newer more exacting methods to determine their potential to serve as participants in or accomplices to a plague persistence reservoir.",M1

Other mammal hosts living on prairie dog colonies may be important in the transmission and maintenance of plague. We examined the flea populations of northern grasshopper mice (Onychomys leucogaster Wied) before, during, and after plague epizootics in northern Colorado and studied the influence of host and environmental factors on flea abundance patterns. Grasshopper mice were frequently infested with high numbers of fleas, most commonly Pleochaetis exilis Jordan and Thrassis fotus Jordan. Flea loads changed in response to both environmental temperature and rainfall. After plague-induced prairie dog die-offs, flea loads and likelihood of infestation were unchanged for P. exilis, but T. fotus loads declined.",M1
19492944,"Flea abundance on black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) increases during <e>plague</e> epizootics.Black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) on the Great Plains of the United States are highly susceptible to plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, with mortality on towns during plague epizootics often approaching 100%. The ability of flea-borne transmission to sustain disease spread has been questioned because of inefficiency of flea vectors. However, even with low individual efficiency, overall transmission can be increased if flea abundance (the number of fleas on hosts) increases. Changes in flea abundance on hosts during plague outbreaks were recorded during a large-scale study of plague outbreaks in prairie dogs in north central Colorado during 3 years (2004-2007). Fleas were collected from live-trapped black-tailed prairie dogs before and during plague epizootics and tested by PCR for the presence of Y. pestis. The predominant fleas were two prairie dog specialists (Oropsylla hirsuta and Oropsylla tuberculata cynomuris), and a generalist flea species (Pulex simulans) was also recorded from numerous mammals in the area. The three species differ in seasonal abundance, with greatest abundance in spring (February and March) and fall (September and October). Flea abundance and infestation intensity increased during epizootics and were highest on prairie dogs with Y. pestis-infected fleas. Seasonal occurrence of epizootics among black-tailed prairie dogs was found to coincide with seasonal peaks in flea abundance. Concentration of infected fleas on surviving animals may account for rapid spread of plague during epizootics. In particular, the role of the generalist flea P. simulans was previously underappreciated.",M1

The aims of the study were 1) describe the spatial distribution of clinical plague cases in the region, 2) identify ecologic correlates of incidence, and 3) incorporate these variables into predictive models that define areas of plague risk. The model explained 74% of the incidence variation and revealed that cases were more common above 1,300 m than below. Remotely-sensed variables associated with differences in soil or vegetation were also identified as incidence predictors. The study demonstrated that plague incidence can be modeled at parish-level scale based on environmental variables and identified parishes where cases may be under-reported and enhanced surveillance and preventative measures may be implemented to decrease the burden of plague.",M1

Analysis of these mutants revealed they possessed marked reductions in expression and immunoreactivity of numerous major proteins and carbohydrate antigens, including F1, Pla, Ymt, V antigen, LPS, and ECA. Moreover, both mutants demonstrated altered epitope specificities of the antigens as determined in immunodot-ELISAs and immunoblotting analyses using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The strains also differed in their susceptibility to the diagnostic <e>plague</e> bacteriophage L-413C.

AF and Cafl are the surface protein antigens of the plague pathogen, which are similar in their capacity for self-aggregation and in the molecular mass of a subunit (about 17 kDa). However, unlike Cafl, FA gives rise to protein aggregates resistant to 2-mercaptoethanol and sodium dodecyl sulfate. FA and Cafl were shown to be immunochemically different antigens, the antibodies to which were present in the plague hyperimmune equine serum.

Current vaccines raise concern for their side effects and limited protection, highlighting the need for an efficacious and rapidly producible vaccine. F1 and V antigens of Yersinia pestis, and F1-V fusion protein produced in Nicotiana benthamiana administered to guinea pigs resulted in immunity and protection against an aerosol challenge of virulent Y. pestis. We examined the effects of plant-derived F1, V, and F1-V on human cells of the innate immunity. F1, V, and F1-V proteins engaged TLR2 signalling and activated IL-6 and CXCL-8 production by monocytes, without affecting the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-10, IL-1beta, and CXCL10. Native F1 antigen and recombinant plant-derived F1 (rF1) and rF1-V all induced similar specific T-cell responses, as shown by their recognition by T-cells from subjects who recovered from Y. pestis infection. Native F1 and rF1 were equally well recognized by serum antibodies of Y. pestis-primed donors, whereas serological reactivity to rF1-V hybrid was lower, and that to rV was virtually absent. In conclusion, plant-derived F1, V, and F1-V antigens are weakly reactogenic for human monocytes and elicit cell-mediated and humoral responses similar to those raised by Y. pestis infection.",M2

In view of the potential biological and practical benefits of a recombinant protein vaccine composed of a single fusion protein containing flagellin and antigen, we have evaluated the efficacy of a fusion protein composed of flagellin and two protective antigens of Yersinia pestis (F1 and V) in eliciting protection against respiratory challenge with Y. pestis. Flagellin-F1-V was produced and purified in high yield under good manufacturing practices conditions. The fusion protein retains full Toll-like receptor 5-stimulating activity in vitro. Using a prime-boost immunization protocol, we found that flagellin-F1-V elicits robust antigen-specific humoral immunity in mice and two species of nonhuman primates. Immune mice were fully protected against intranasal challenge with 150 mean tolerated doses of Y. pestis CO92. In immune mice, the bacteria were completely cleared within 3 days after challenge. Flagellin-F1-V exhibited full stability for at least 297 days at 4 degrees C and at least 168 days at 25 degrees C. At between 29 and 84 days at 37 degrees C, the protein exhibited a loss of biological activity that appeared to be associated with a substantial change in protein diameter, possibly due to oligomerization. On the basis of our results, we believe that flagellin-F1-V is an outstanding candidate for evaluation in studies with humans.",M2

Nonhuman primate models have proven critical for testing of vaccines and therapeutics in the general population, but a model using old animals has not been established. Toward that end, immunity to LcrV, a protective Ag from Yersinia pestis, was tested in young and old baboons. Surprisingly, there was no age-associated loss in immune competence; LcrV elicited high-titer, protective Ab responses in the older individuals. The primary responses in the younger baboons were lower, but they did show boosting upon secondary immunization to the levels achieved in the old animals. The LcrV Ag was also tested in mice and, as expected, age-associated loss of immunity was seen; older animals responded with lower-titer Abs and, as a result, were more susceptible to Yersinia challenge. Thus, although age-related loss in immune function has been observed in humans, rodents, and some nonhuman primates, baboons appear to be unusual; they age without losing immune competence.",M2

The F1-LcrV (F1-V) subunit vaccine in alhydrogel is known to induce humoral immunity. In this study, we utilized DC to investigate cellular immunity. We genetically engineered the LcrV virulence protein into the anti-DEC-205/CD205 mAb and thereby targeted the conjugated protein directly to mouse DEC-205(+) DC in situ. We observed antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell immunity measured by intracellular staining for IFN-gamma in three different mouse strains (C57BL/6, BALB/c, and C3H/HeJ), while we could not observe such T cell responses with F1-V vaccine in alhydrogel. Using a peptide library for LcrV protein, we identified two or more distinct CD4(+) T cell mimetopes in each MHC haplotype, consistent with the induction of broad immunity. When compared to nontargeted standard protein vaccine, DC targeting greatly increased the efficiency for inducing IFN-gamma-producing T cells. The targeted LcrV protein induced antibody responses to a similar extent as the F1-V subunit vaccine, but Th1-dependent IgG2a and IgG2c isotypes were observed only after anti-DEC-205:LcrV mAb immunization.

The most significant findings of the study reported here are that (1) a combinatorial vaccine consisting of equal amounts of F1-V and rPA administered SC is effective at eliciting a robust serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) antigen-specific IgG and IgG1 response against both antigens in immunized animals, and when administered IN, a robust antigen-specific IgG2a response in the serum and BAL is also induced; (2) there were few instances where either synergy or interference was observed in the combined vaccine administered by either route and those differences occurred soon after the final immunization and were not sustained over time; (3) IN immunization was as effective as SC immunization for induction of antigen-specific serum and BAL antibody responses using the same amount of antigen; (4) the IgG1/IgG2a ratios suggest a strongly biased Type 2 response following SC immunization, while IN immunization produced a more balanced Type 1/Type 2 response; (5) the IgG1/IgG2a ratio was influenced by the route of immunization, the adjuvant employed, and the nature of the antigen. As with previously published studies, there were still detectable levels of circulating anti-F1-V and anti-rPA even 6 months post-primary immunization.

To test the hypothesis that this limited immunogenicity results from the nature of vaccine interactions with the host innate immune system, we investigated molecular and cellular interactions between vaccines, dendritic cells (DCs), and T cells and explored the potential for adjuvants (pertussis) to boost induction of host immunity. Human monocyte-derived DCs were matured in the presence of vaccines and analyzed for their ability to induce Th1/Th2 development from naive T cells, expression of cell surface maturation/costimulation molecules, and cytokine production. The vaccines showed different behavior patterns. Although the plague vaccine is equivalent to control maturation factors in maturation and stimulation of DCs and induces strong MLR and Th outgrowth, the anthrax vaccine is a poor inducer of DC maturation, as indicated by low levels of HLA-DR, CD86, and CD83 induction and minimal proinflammatory cytokine production. Interestingly, however, anthrax vaccine-treated DCs stimulate Th1 and Th2 outgrowth and a limited MLR response. There was no sustained negative modulatory effects of the anthrax vaccine on DCs, and its limited stimulatory effects could be overridden by coculture with pertussis. These results were supported by analysis of anthrax vaccine recall responses in subjects vaccinated using pertussis as an adjuvant, who demonstrate anthrax-specific effector T cell responses. These data show that the anthrax vaccine is a suboptimal DC stimulus that may in part explain the observation that it requires repeated administration in vivo and offer a rational basis for the use of complementary DC-maturing adjuvants in combined immunotherapy.",M2

All the subjects produced specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in serum after the priming dose, which peaked in value after the booster dose (day 21), with the exception of one individual in the lowest dose level group, who responded to rF1 only. Three subjects, found to have an anti-rV titer at screening, were excluded from the overall analysis. Human antibody functionality has been assessed by quantification of antibody competing for binding to rV in vitro and also by the transfer of protective immunity in human serum into the naive mouse. Human and macaque IgG competed for binding to rV in vitro with a mouse monoclonal antibody, previously shown to protect mice against challenge with plague, suggesting that this protective B-cell epitope on rV is conserved between these three species. Total IgG to rV in individuals and the titer of IgG competing for binding to rV correlated significantly at days 21 (r = 0.72; P &lt; 0.001) and 28 (r = 0.82; P &lt; 0.001).

15784563,"Yersinia pestis V protein epitopes recognized by CD4 T cells.Pneumonic <e>plague</e>, an often-fatal disease for which no vaccine is presently available, results from pulmonary infection by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The Y. pestis V protein is a promising vaccine candidate, as V protein immunizations confer to mice significant protection against aerosolized Y. pestis. CD4 T cells play central roles during vaccine-primed immune responses, but their functional contributions to Y. pestis vaccines have yet to be evaluated and optimized. Toward that end, we report here the identification of three distinct epitopes within the Y. pestis V protein that activate CD4 T cells in C57BL/6 mice. To our knowledge, these are the first identified CD4 T-cell epitopes in any Y. pestis protein. The epitopes are restricted by the I-A(b) class II major histocompatibility complex molecule and are fully conserved between Y. pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Immunizing mice with a V protein-containing vaccine or with short peptides containing the identified epitopes primes antigen-specific production of interleukin 2 and gamma interferon by CD4 T cells upon their restimulation in vitro. Consistent with prior studies documenting protective roles for CD4 T cells during Y. enterocolitica infection, vaccinating mice with a 16-amino-acid peptide encoding one of the epitopes suffices to protect against an otherwise lethal Y. enterocolitica challenge. The identification of these epitopes will permit quantitative assessments of V-specific CD4 T cells, thereby enabling researchers to evaluate and optimize the contribution of these cells to vaccine-primed protection against pneumonic plague.",M2
15784541,"Antibiotic-free plasmid stabilization by operator-repressor titration for vaccine delivery by using live Salmonella enterica Serovar typhimurium.Live, attenuated bacteria are effective vectors for heterologous antigen delivery. However, loss of heterologous gene-bearing plasmids is problematic, and antibiotics and their resistance genes are not desirable for in vivo DNA vaccine delivery due to biosafety and regulatory concerns. To solve this problem, we engineered the first vaccine delivery strain that has no requirement for antibiotics or other selectable marker genes to maintain the recombinant plasmid. This model strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, SLDAPD, uses operator-repressor titration (ORT) technology, which requires only the short, nonexpressed lacO sequence for selection and maintenance. SLDAPD, recovered from the spleens and Peyer's patches of mice following oral inoculation, was shown to maintain a plasmid that, in contrast, was lost from parental strain SL3261. We also demonstrated successful application of this technology to vaccine development, since SLDAPD carrying a plasmid without an antibiotic resistance gene that expressed the Yersinia pestis F1 antigen was as efficacious in protecting vaccinated mice against <e>plague</e> as the parental SL3261 strain carrying an antibiotic-selected version of this plasmid. Protection of mice against plague by immunization with Salmonella expressing F1 has previously required two or more doses; here we demonstrated for the first time protective immunity after a single oral immunization. This technology can easily be used to convert any suitable attenuated strain to an antibiotic-free ORT strain for recombinant protein vaccine delivery in humans.",M2
15734068,"Effect of homologous and heterologous prime-boost on the immune response to recombinant <e>plague</e> antigens.Among the pathogens that have been identified as potential agents of biological warfare or bioterrorism, Yersinia pestis is one of the main concerns due to the severity and potential transmissibility of the pneumonic form of the disease in humans. There are no approved vaccines for protection against pneumonic plague, but a Y. pestis-derived fusion protein (F1-V) has shown great promise as a protective antigen in murine studies. In the current study, we examine different prime-boost regimens, including parenteral, mucosal, and transcutaneous delivery, in order to explore the effect of changing the route of prime and boost on the ability of recombinant F1-V to promote the development of long-lasting, high-titer antibodies. The most significant findings of the study reported here are that (1) intranasal and subcutaneous immunizations are both effective and essentially equivalent for induction of serum and bronchioalveolar anti-F1-V IgG1 responses when a single booster dose is administered by the same (homologous) route, (2) heterologous boosting can be as or more effective than homologous boosting for induction of either serum or bronchioalveolar anti-F1-V IgG1 responses, and (3) anti-F1 and anti-V total IgG responses were highest in animals primed intranasally and boosted by any route when compared to animals primed transcutaneously or subcutaneously. As with previously published studies, there were still significant levels of circulating anti-F1-V antibodies 1 year post-primary immunization. These studies provide important insights into the development of new-generation biodefense vaccines.",M2

15174978,"Yersinia pestis (<e>plague</e>) vaccines.Live attenuated and killed whole cell vaccines against disease caused by Yersinia pestis have been available since the early part of the last century. Although these vaccines indicate the feasibility of protecting against disease, they have a number of shortcomings. The live attenuated vaccine is highly reactogenic and is not licensed for use in humans. The killed whole cell vaccine, also reactogenic, provides poor protection against pneumonic plague and immunisation requires multiple doses of the vaccine. Against this background, a range of candidate vaccines, including rationally attenuated mutants, subunit vaccines and naked DNA vaccines have been described. Of these, an injected subunit vaccine is likely to offer the best near-term solution to the provision of a vaccine that protects against both bubonic and pneumonic plague.",M2
14742535,"Generation of Yersinia pestis attenuated strains by signature-tagged mutagenesis in search of novel vaccine candidates.In a search for novel attenuated vaccine candidates for use against Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of <e>plague</e>, a signature-tagged mutagenesis strategy was used and optimized for a subcutaneously infected mouse model. A library of tagged mutants of the virulent Y. pestis Kimberley53 strain was generated. Screening of 300 mutants through two consecutive cycles resulted in selection of 16 mutant strains that were undetectable in spleens 48 h postinfection. Each of these mutants was evaluated in vivo by assays for competition against the wild-type strain and for virulence following inoculation of 100 CFU (equivalent to 100 50% lethal doses [LD50] of the wild type). A wide spectrum of attenuation was obtained, ranging from avirulent mutants exhibiting competition indices of 10(-5) to 10(-7) to virulent mutants exhibiting a delay in the mean time to death or mutants indistinguishable from the wild type in the two assays. Characterization of the phenotypes and genotypes of the selected mutants led to identification of virulence-associated genes coding for factors involved in global bacterial physiology (e.g., purH, purK, dnaE, and greA) or for hypothetical polypeptides, as well as for the virulence regulator gene lcrF. One of the avirulent mutant strains (LD50, &gt;10(7) CFU) was found to be disrupted in the pcm locus, which is presumably involved in the bacterial response to environmental stress. This Kimberley53pcm mutant was superior to the EV76 live vaccine strain because it induced 10- to 100-fold-higher antibody titers to the protective V and F1 antigens and because it conferred efficacious protective immunity.",M2
11516788,"Intranasal vaccination against <e>plague</e>, tetanus and diphtheria.Plague is an extremely virulent and potentially lethal infection caused by the bacterium Y. pestis. The current vaccine used to immunise against plague often fails to engender solid (100%) protection against inhalational infection with Y. pestis. Similarly, logistical factors favour the development of non-parenteral immunisation protocols to counter plague. Recently an improved parenteral vaccination strategy for plague, based on the recombinant subunit approach, has entered clinical trails. The Yersinia pestis subunit antigens (F1 and V) have been successfully incorporated into novel vaccine delivery systems such as biodegradable microspheres composed of poly-L-(lactide) (PLLA). Intranasal and intratracheal administration of PLLA microencapsulated F1 and V serves to protect experimental animals from inhalational and subcutaneous challenge with virulent Y. pestis bacilli. Liposomes have also been used to improve the immunogenicity of intranasally administered Y. pestis antigens, and the effectiveness of this approach to plague immunisation has been evaluated. Tetanus and diphtheria still cause many deaths worldwide. The maintenance of protective immunity to diphtheria and tetanus requires booster injections of the currently licensed toxoid vaccines. Consequently, many people remain unprotected. Improved coverage may well result from the development of effective non-invasive vaccines that could be readily distributed and potentially self-administered. To this end, the intranasal and inhalational routes of administration have been extensively investigated. Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids have been delivered intranasally to experimental animals using a wide variety of adjuvants (enterotoxin derivatives), penetration enhancers (cyclodextrins, bile salts, surfactants, cationic polymers) and delivery systems (microspheres and liposomes). As compared with parenteral vaccination, nasal immunisation has been shown favourably effective in small animal models, and a limited number of early phase clinical trails. As a caveat to this, adjuvantisation of toxoid/subunit molecules appears to be a requisite for elicitation of appreciable immunological responses, following nasal administration of acellular immunogens. Testing in larger animal models and humans is needed to ascertain if the promising results obtained in rodents can be reciprocated without compromising safety.",M2

The correlation of LBCT with the level of antiinfectious resistance suggests that this index is of high informative value and that it can be effectively used for testing the cellular immunity and the characteristically biological properties of the plague causative agent and its antigens.",M2
9796057,"Analysis of local and systemic immunological responses after intra-tracheal, intra-nasal and intra-muscular administration of microsphere co-encapsulated Yersinia pestis sub-unit vaccines.Intra-tracheal, intra-nasal and intra-muscular immunisation with admixed Y. pestis sub-units (3 micrograms V, 0.47 microgram F1) or equivalent doses of poly-L-lactide microsphere co-encapsulated antigens was done. Systemic and mucosal responses to F1 and V differed according to immunisation route, and encapsulated status of the sub-units. Irrespective of immunisation site, particulated sub-units stimulated statistically superior primary systemic reactions, with intra-tracheal and nasal microsphere immunisations eliciting superior serum anti-V IgG titres in comparison to intra-muscular injection of free vaccines (p &lt; 0.001 beyond day 8). Pulmonary and nasal delivery of microspheres induced primary serum anti-V IgG titres which were greater (p &lt; 0.039) or equal to (p &gt; 0.056) those after intra-muscular injection of spheres. In terms of serum anti-F1 titres, mice responded best to intra-muscular, and comparatively poorly to intra-nasal immunisations. Intra-tracheal administration of microspheres induced strongest responses in the respiratory tract, dominated by the IgG rather than IgA isotype. An intra-nasal booster immunisation on day 63 potentiated strong local and circulating anti-V IgG titres in microsphere vaccinees. Priming and boosting with free vaccines induced significantly depressed secondary serum anti-F1 titres relative to microsphere immunisations (p &lt; 0.024 at days 78 and 120). In contrast to other priming sites, intra-tracheal instillation of encapsulated vaccines facilitated the induction of IgG antibody to both F1 and V in day 146 broncho-alveolal washings. With the exception of primary responses to F1 in mice immunised intra-tracheally with microspheres, IgG1 was the dominant subclass of anti-F1/V IgG in serum. We conclude that introduction of biodegradable microspheres containing the F1 and V sub-units into to the upper or lower respiratory tract engenders immune responses of a magnitude comparable with that induced by parenteral immunisation, and may present a means of protecting individuals from <e>plague</e>.",M2

8578841,"A comparison of <e>Plague</e> vaccine, USP and EV76 vaccine induced protection against Yersinia pestis in a murine model.The median lethal dose (MLD) of a pathogenic strain of Yersinia pestis was established by three routes of administration in three strains of mouse. There was no significant difference between the MLDs in the different strains of mouse. The MLD by the subcutaneous route in Balb/C and an outbred line was approximately 1 c.f.u.; the MLD following intraperitoneal administration was tenfold higher. There were significant differences in the mean times to death after administration of the challenge by different routes. The relative efficacy of a live attenuated vaccine strain of Y. pestis (EV76) was compared with that of the formaldehyde-killed vaccine (Plague vaccine, USP). EV76 protected against high challenge doses (up to 5.75 x 10(6) MLD), though immunized animals showed side effects of varying severity. The killed vaccine was less effective in terms of dose-protection (deaths occurred after challenge with 4000 MLD) and several of the vaccinated animals suffered sub-lethal, plague-related sequelae to the challenge.",M2

It is established that the activation of macrophages accompanied by the increase of C3R expression on the external surface of the membrane of both peritoneal and alveolar macrophages occurs in the process of formation of antiplague immunity. Maximum activity of C3R in the both populations of macrophages is observed on the 7th day after vaccination. Immunization of the plague microbe by the vaccine strain does not change the character of response of peritoneal and alveolar macrophages to their interaction with this microorganism in vitro: a decrease of C3R expression on the surface of the both populations of cells obtained from both intact and immunized animals is observed.
