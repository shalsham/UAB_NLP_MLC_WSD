19902838,"Streptococcosis in farmed Litopenaeus vannamei: a new emerging bacterial disease of penaeid shrimp.Presumptive systemic streptococcal infections were detected histologically in farmed Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles submitted from a Latin American country and the bacteria isolated. Characterization work demonstrated that the Gram-positive cocci form chains, grow aerobically and anaerobically, are oxidase- and catalase-negative, non-hemolytic, non-motile, Lancefield Group B positive and PCR positive when amplified with a universal streptococcal primer set. Differing Streptococcus identifications were obtained using API 20 <e>Strep</e> and Biolog systems, the former identifying the isolate as S. uberis and the latter as S. parauberis. Injection of specific pathogen-free (SPF) L. vannamei with the bacteria resulted in 100% mortality by 3 d post-injection with successful recovery of the agent from moribund test shrimp hemolymph samples. The recovered isolate was used in per os and waterborne exposure studies of SPF L. vannamei with mortalities ranging from 40 to 100% and 80 to 100%, respectively. Histologic analysis of 5 to 8 moribund shrimp from each exposure method demonstrated that all contained a severe bacteremia characterized by numerous free cocci within the hemolymph and aggregates of vacuolated hemocytes with notable intravacuolar cocci. This unique lesion type was most pronounced within the lymphoid organ and considered pathodiagnostic for this disease. Experimentally induced lesions were identical to those in naturally infected farmed shrimp and the Streptococcus sp. responsible was re-isolated, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Five freeze/thaw cycles of 10 experimentally infected shrimp were performed over a 2 mo period and the bacteria successfully cultured from all shrimp at each interval. These collective findings describe the first reported case of streptococcosis in marine penaeid shrimp in the Western Hemisphere and indicate that the agent may be disseminated via live or frozen infected shrimp.",M1
19521461,"Vaccines against bovine mastitis in the New Zealand context: what is the best way forward?Mastitis is an important animal health disease which constitutes a serious problem for the dairy industry in New Zealand. Mastitis reduces milk yield and quality, necessitates the use of antibiotic therapy, with associated risks of contaminating the raw milk supply, and imposes a serious economic burden, currently estimated at NZ$300 million per year. Mastitis is caused by a variety of infectious agents. In the New Zealand context, with cattle grazing on pasture, Streptococcus uberis is a major bacterial pathogen, responsible for a significant proportion of clinical cases, especially during early lactation and the dry period. Other pathogens of significance include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Escherichia coli, as well as so-called 'minor pathogens', namely coagulase-negative staphylococci(CNS). Current strategies aimed at reducing cases of mastitis include improved hygiene in the farm environment, particularly with regards to the health and cleanliness of teats. Once mastitis occurs, antibiotic therapy is a favoured option, and as a prophylactic tool, in the form of dry-cow therapy, has also shown value. Prevention of mastitis using immunological tools such as vaccines lags behind the major vaccine breakthroughs that have been achieved in preventing and/or reducing the severity of numerous infectious diseases in animals. In this review, the current state of research in the area of development of vaccines against mastitis is summarised, with particular emphasis on bacteria important to the dairy farming industry in New Zealand. Few, if any, effective vaccines have been designed to prevent or mitigate intramammary infections. It is argued that novel approaches must be considered to search for vaccine candidates, and vaccines need to be designed and constructed within the special framework of their uses, in the mammary gland which offers a unique immunological environment. In addition, effective vaccines against mastitis due to <e>Strep</e>. uberis may be more likely to emerge from strategies that target the cell-mediated arm of the immune response rather than strategies that target specific antibody responses.",M1
18487673,"Pathogen-specific effects of quantitative trait loci affecting clinical mastitis and somatic cell count in Danish Holstein cattle.The aim of this study was to investigate whether quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting the risk of clinical mastitis (CM) and QTL affecting somatic cell score (SCS) exhibit pathogen-specific effects on the incidence of mastitis. Bacteriological data on mastitis pathogens were used to investigate pathogen specificity of QTL affecting treatments of mastitis in first parity (CM1), second parity (CM2), and third parity (CM3), and QTL affecting SCS. The 5 most common mastitis pathogens in the Danish dairy population were analyzed: Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus uberis. Data were analyzed using 2 approaches: an independence test and a generalized linear mixed model. Three different data sets were used to investigate the effect of data sampling: all samples, only samples that were followed by antibiotic treatment, and samples from first-crop daughters only. The results showed with high certainty that 2 QTL affecting SCS exhibited pathogen specificity against Staph. aureus and E. coli, respectively. The latter result might be explained by a pleiotropic QTL that also affects CM2 and CM3. Less certain results were found for QTL affecting CM. A QTL affecting CM1 was found to be specific against <e>Strep</e>. dysgalactiae and Staph. aureus, a QTL affecting CM2 was found to be specific against E. coli, and finally a QTL affecting CM3 was found to be specific against Staph. aureus. None of the QTL analyzed was found to be specific against coagulase-negative staphylococci and Strep. uberis. Our results show that particular mastitis QTL are highly likely to exhibit pathogen-specificity. However, the results should be interpreted carefully because the results are sensitive to the sampling method and method of analysis. Field data were used in this study. These kind of data may be heavily biased because there is no standard procedure for collecting milk samples for bacteriological analysis in Denmark. Furthermore, using only the mean SCS from d 10 to 180 after parturition may lead to truncated effects of SCS-QTL when samples collected after d 180 are used. Additionally, repeated samples were used, which could boost the difference in incidence of pathogens between daughters of sires inheriting the positive and negative QTL allele, respectively. However, the magnitude of these effects in this study is unclear.",M1
18349371,"Periodontitis is associated with a loss of colonization by Streptococcus sanguinis.The aim of this study was to estimate differences in the prevalence of oral streptococcal species in the subgingival biofilm of patients with aggressive periodontitis and of healthy controls. Thirty-three patients with clinical and radiological proof of aggressive periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Clinical indices were recorded in a six-point measurement per tooth. Samples of the subgingival biofilm were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. Alpha- and non-haemolytic, small and catalase-negative colonies were biochemically identified using a rapid ID 32 <e>STREP</e> system and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A total of 118 strains of oral streptococci (11 species) were identified and Streptococcus sanguinis was found significantly more often in healthy subjects (P=0.001). Conversely, the absence of S. sanguinis was associated with high values of clinical indices (P=0.001-0.002). Aggressive periodontitis seems to be associated with a loss of colonization of S. sanguinis. Whether or not S. sanguinis offers protection against aggressive periodontitis needs to be determined. Otherwise, there were no significant differences in the distribution of oral streptococcal species in patients and healthy subjects.",M1
18175702,"Streptococcus dentirousetti sp. nov., isolated from the oral cavities of bats.Seventy-three strains of streptococci were isolated from the bat oral cavity. The colonies of strains grown on mitis salivarius agar were similar in morphology to those of mutans-like streptococci. The novel strains were analysed biochemically using the Rapid ID32 <e>Strep</e> microsystem and were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridization with other oral streptococci and to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that these isolates be classified as Streptococcus dentirousetti sp. nov. The type strain of Streptococcus dentirousetti sp. nov. is NUM 1303(T) (=JCM 14596(T)=DSM 18963(T)).",M1
18095606,"[Identifying group G beta-hemolytic Streptococci strains by 16S rDNA sequencing]OBJECTIVE: To identify the DNA sequences of 26 beta-hemolytic group G streptococci strains isolated from the swabs of patients in a glomerulonephritis outbreak event. METHODS: API20 <e>Strep</e> system and 16S rDNA sequencing were performed on all of the 26 isolated strains respectively. The dendrogram based on the analysis of the 16S rDNA sequences of four groups of G streptococci strains was constructed by the neighbor-joining method and boot-strap test. RESULTS: The API20 Strep system failed to identify the strains with less than 62% of success rates. All of the 26 group G beta-hemolytic streptococci isolates were identified as Streptococcus anginosus by the 16S rDNA sequencing, with more than 97% of success rates. The dendrogram illustrated that the four groups of G streptococci strains were clustered at the same branch with Streptococcus anginosus. CONCLUSION: The 16S rDNA sequencing has unique advantages over the phenotypic methods. It can provide detailed information of nucleotides and identify species of beta-hemolytic G group streptococci.",M1
17954749,"Genotypic and phenotypic detection of macrolide and lincosamide resistance in Streptococcus uberis.Streptococcus uberis isolates (n = 55) were obtained from milk samples of cases of mild clinical mastitis in 55 dairy cows from 35 herds serviced by one veterinary practice in Mayenne, France. Isolates were tested for macrolide and lincosamide resistance by using phenotypic and genotypic methods. Erythromycin resistance was detected in 12 of the 55 (22%) isolates based on agar disc diffusion testing and MIC measurements, and was encoded by ermB. This gene also conferred phenotypic resistance to pirlimycin based on MIC measurements, but the D-test was needed for detection of the resistance phenotype in the agar disc diffusion test. Isolates with ermB were also highly resistant to the macrolide antibiotic spiramycin. Seventeen of the 55 isolates (31%) were classified as resistant to spiramcyin only and as having intermediate susceptibility to spiramycin based on agar disc diffusion testing and MIC measurements, respectively. The genetic mechanism behind this phenotype and its clinical relevance are unknown. The efflux pump gene mefA was not detected in any of the 55 isolates in this study. Pirlimycin resistance without macrolide resistance was encoded by the lincosamide resistance gene linB in 4 isolates. Based on current guidelines, some linB-positive isolates would be classified as susceptible by using phenotypic tests, and alternative values for the interpretation of the agar disc diffusion test are suggested. We conclude that the agar disc diffusion test is a useful indicator for macrolide and lincosamide resistance of <e>Strep</e>. uberis in veterinary practice, provided that the D-test is used for detection of pirlimycin resistance.",M1
17699021,"Galactose metabolism and capsule formation in a recombinant strain of Streptococcus thermophilus with a galactose-fermenting phenotype.The capsule-producing, galactose-negative Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C strain was first transformed with a low-copy plasmid containing a functional galK gene from Streptococcus salivarius to generate a recombinant galactose-fermenting <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus strain named MR-AAC. Then, we compared the functional properties of Strep. thermophilus MR-AAC with those of the parent MR-1C strain when used as starter for fermented products and cheese. In lactose-supplemented laboratory medium, MR-AAC metabolized galactose, but only when the amount of lactose was less than 0.1% (wt/vol). After 7 h of fermentation, the medium was almost depleted of galactose. The parent strain, MR-1C, showed the same pattern, except that the concentration of galactose decreased by only 25% during the same period. It was found that, during milk fermentation and Mozzarella cheese production, the galactose-fermenting phenotype was not expressed by MR-AAC and this strain expelled galactose into the medium at a level similar to the parent MR-1C strain. In milk and in lactose-supplemented medium, capsular exopolysaccharide production occurred mainly during the late exponential phase and the stationary growth phase with similar kinetics between MR-1C and MR-AAC.",M1
17551042,"Streptococcus orisuis sp. nov., isolated from the pig oral cavity.Five bacterial strains, designated as NUM 1001(T), NUM 1002, NUM 1003, NUM 1004 and NUM 1005, were isolated from the oral cavities of pigs. Colonies grown on mitis salivarius agar were similar in morphology to those of mutans streptococci. The novel isolates were analysed biochemically using the Rapid ID 32 <e>Strep</e> microsystem, subjected to DNA-DNA hybridization with oral streptococci and had their 16S rRNA genes sequenced. On the basis of the phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence obtained, the strains represent a novel species of the genus Streptococcus, for which the name Streptococcus orisuis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NUM 1001(T) (=JCM 14035(T)=DSM 18307(T)).",M1
17235154,"Streptococcus dysgalactiae isolates at calving and lactation performance within the same lactation.The objective of the study was to investigate the association between early lactation Streptococcus dysgalactiae isolates and milk yield, somatic cell count (SCC), clinical mastitis, and culling in the same lactation. The 178 commercial dairy herds were randomly placed into 3 penicillin- or penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin-based dry-cow treatments and 3 different postmilking teat disinfection groups-negative control, iodine, or external teat sealant. All cows were sampled in early lactation, and <e>Strep</e>. dysgalactiae-positive and culture-negative cows were followed throughout the remainder of the lactation. Mixed models, including repeated measurements, with test-day observation as dependent variable, were used to compare milk yield, SCC, and available milk quality variables throughout the remaining lactation. Survival analyses, using a positive frailty model to account for any herd random effects, were used to estimate the hazard ratio for clinical mastitis and culling. Streptococcus dysgalactiae-positive cows had a significantly higher SCC throughout the lactation compared to culture-negative cows. For primiparous or multiparous cows, respectively, the differences in the geometric mean SCC between Strep. dysgalactiae-positive and culture-negative cows was 197,000 or 280,000 cells/mL at the beginning of the lactation, 24,000 or 46,000 cells/mL in mid lactation, and 39,000 or 111,000 cells/mL at the end of the lactation. Streptococcus dysgalactiae-positive primiparous or multiparous cows produced 334 or 246 kg less milk, respectively, during a 305-d lactation compared with culture-negative cows. Compared with culture-negative cows, the hazard ratios for clinical mastitis in Strep. dysgalactiae-positive cows were 2.3 (1.9 to 2.9) and 1.6 (1.3 to 2.0) for culling. For cows with both Strep. dysgalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus isolates, the hazard ratio for culling significantly increased to 2.5 (1.9 to 3.2).",M1
17176853,"[Evaluation of rapid diagnostic kits for the detection of group A streptococcus to Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus spp. with Lancefield's group A antigen]We studied the basic performance of eight rapid diagnostic kits for the detection of Group A streptococcus by immunochromatography under the same conditions. Kits were the; QuickVue Dipstick <e>Strep</e> A (Sumitomo Seiyaku Biomedical Co., Ltd.), TESTPACK Plus STREP A (ABBOTT JAPAN Co., Ltd), CLEAVIEW STREP A (Nihon Schering K. K.), QuickVue STREP A (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd), ImmunoCard STAT! STREP A (TFB, INC.), DIPSTICK 'Eiken' STREP A (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd.), Rapid Testa Strep A (Daiichi Pure Chemical Co., Ltd.), and StatCheck Strep A (KAINOS Laboratories, Inc.). Four of these kits, i.e. QuickVue Dipstick Strep A, TESTPACK Plus STREP A, Rapid Testa Strep A, and StatCheck Strep A showed sensitivity at 1.0 x 10(5) CFU/mL (1.0 x 10(4)CFU/test) with all of S. pyogenes tested, while the Anginosus group and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis with Lancefield' s group A antigen showed sensitivity very similar to S. pyogenes. Of these strains, S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis formed a beta-hemolytic colony resembling that of S. pyogenes on sheep blood agar, and was sensitive to bacitracin. It is thus indispensable to identify the colony using biochemical tests such as the PYR (pyrrolidonylarylamidase production) test. In using rapid diagnostic kits for the detection of Group A streptococcus, it is important to rule out the possibility of Group A streptococcus other than S. pyogenes in throats. Severe invasive group-G streptococcal infections are increasing recently. Concerning S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, it is especially important to conduct these identification tests.",M1
17065265,"Array-based identification of species of the genera Abiotrophia, Enterococcus, Granulicatella, and Streptococcus.Some species of enterococci and streptococci are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. The feasibility of using an oligonucleotide array for identification of 11 viridans group streptococci was previously established. The aim of this study was to expand the array to identify species of Abiotrophia (1 species), Enterococcus (18 species), Granulicatella (3 species), and Streptococcus (31 species and 6 subspecies). The method consisted of PCR amplification of the ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer (ITS) regions, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled PCR products to a panel of oligonucleotide probes (16- to 30-mers) immobilized on a nylon membrane. Probes could be divided into three categories: species specific, group specific, and supplemental probes. All probes were designed either from the ITS regions or from the 3' ends of the 16S rRNA genes. A collection of 312 target strains (162 reference strains and 150 clinical isolates) and 73 nontarget strains was identified by the array. Most clinical isolates were isolated from blood cultures or deep abscesses, and only those strains having excellent species identification with the Rapid ID 32 <e>STREP</e> system (bioMérieux Vitek, Taipei, Taiwan) were used for array testing. The test sensitivity and specificity of the array were 100% (312/312) and 98.6% (72/73), respectively. The whole procedure of array hybridization took about 8 h, starting from isolated colonies, and the hybridization patterns could be read by the naked eye. The oligonucleotide array is accurate for identification of the above microorganisms and could be used as a reliable alternative to phenotypic identification methods.",M1
16840608,"Relationships between milk culture results and treatment for clinical mastitis or culling in Norwegian dairy cattle.In quarter milk samples from 2,492 randomly sampled cows that were selected without regard to their current or previous udder health status, the relationships between the following outcome variables were studied: treatment of clinical mastitis; the joint event of either treatment or culling for mastitis; culling for all reasons; culling specifically for mastitis; and the covariates of positive milk culture for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., or other pathogens, or of negative culture for mastitis pathogens. Microbiological diagnoses were assigned at the cow level, and altogether 3,075 diagnoses were related to the outcome variables. The relation between the absence of pathogens and rich (&gt;1,500 cfu/mL of milk) or sparse (&lt;or=1,500 cfu/mL of milk) growth of Staph. aureus were also assessed separately for each outcome variable. The hazard of treatment of clinical mastitis was greater for cows diagnosed with Staph. aureus compared with cows with no pathogens in all analyses. Cows with sparse growth of Staph. aureus upon microbiological analysis were more likely to be treated for clinical mastitis, and cows with rich growth of the bacteria experienced a higher overall risk of culling when the models adjusted for cow composite milk somatic cell count. No difference between rich and sparse growth of Staph. aureus was found when mastitis was defined as the joint event of either culling for mastitis or treatment of clinical mastitis, and when the relationship with culling specifically for mastitis was assessed. The combined outcome of treatment and culling for mastitis was related to a positive diagnosis of <e>Strep</e>. spp. after cow composite milk somatic cell count was omitted from the model. Presence of Streptococcus spp. was also related to culling specifically for mastitis, whereas culling for all reasons and treatment of clinical mastitis was not related to a positive culture of Strep. spp. Presence of coagulase-negative Staph. spp. or other pathogens was not associated with either of the outcome variables.",M1
16553744,"In vitro binding interactions of oral bacteria with immobilized fructosyltransferase.AIMS: The objective of the present study was to explore the role of immobilized fructosyltransferase (FTF) in adhesion process. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated real-time biospecific interactions between several types of oral bacteria and recombinant FTF immobilized on a biosensor chip, using surface plasmon resonance technology. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Actinomyces viscosus demonstrated significant binding to FTF. Actinomyces viscosus had a greater binding to FTF, with 373 Resonance Units (RU), than the other tested bacteria. The binding level to FTF of <e>Strep</e>. sobrinus was 320 RU, whereas Strep. mutans and Streptococcus salivarious show binding of 296 and 245 RU, respectively. The binding sensograms displayed different profiles for the tested bacteria at various cell density, suggesting a different affinity to immobilized FTF. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest that FTF may influence bacterial adherence and colonization of the dental biofilm. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The biomolecular interaction analysis enables real-time monitoring of the interaction between adhesions of intact bacteria and their ligands, which might be crucial in the initial phase of biofilm development in vivo.",M1
16507696,"Milk culture results in a large Norwegian survey--effects of season, parity, days in milk, resistance, and clustering.A nationwide random computerized assignment survey that included 3,538 sets of 4 quarter milk samples from 2,834 dairy cows was conducted during 2000. Every fifth cow from every 50th herd was randomly selected for sampling and culture during each quarter of the year. Milk culture results of pathogens known to be related to mastitis were recorded regardless of whether mastitis had been indicated by any inflammatory measure or not. Farmers were blinded to all test results to minimize any potential interventions that might be prompted by the results. The most prevalent isolate was Staphylococcus aureus, which was identified in 8.2% of the quarter milk samples. More than 15 colony-forming units/0.01 mL of Staph. aureus were found in 4.3% of the quarter milk samples, whereas 3.5% had only 1 to 3 colony-forming units/0.01 mL. Streptococcus dysgalactiae, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), and Streptococcus uberis were isolated from 1.2, 3.3, and 0.4% of quarter milk samples, respectively. No isolates were found in 76.6% of the quarter milk samples tested. Among individual cows, 22.2% had an isolate of Staph. aureus in &gt; or = 1 quarter. Only <e>Strep</e>. dysgalactiae exhibited a higher prevalence with increased parity. Prevalence of Staph. aureus decreased throughout days in milk, but prevalence of Strep. dysgalactiae increased. There was a strong seasonal effect; the highest prevalence of Strep. dysgalactiae and CNS was observed during April and May (late indoor season), and the highest prevalence of Staph. aureus and Strep. uberis was observed during June and July (the outdoor season). A substantial within-cow clustering effect was found for Strep. dysgalactiae, Staph. aureus, and CNS. Additionally, a within-herd effect was found for Strep. uberis, penicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, total Staph. aureus, and CNS. No within-county cluster effect was found. Lastly, both Staph. aureus and CNS exhibited a surprisingly high seasonal effect regarding the prevalence of resistance to penicillin G. Penicillin resistance of Staph. aureus was likely due to higher prevalence of Staph. aureus as a whole, but for CNS, there was also an additional increase caused by a higher proportional rate of penicillin resistance during the late indoor season.",M1
16478486,"Interference in adhesion of bacteria and yeasts isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber by rhamnolipid biosurfactants.AIMS: The effects and extent of adhesion of four different bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed rhamnolipid biosurfactant layer obtained from Pseudomonasaeruginosa DS10-129 was studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ability of rhamnolipid biosurfactant to inhibit adhesion of micro-organisms to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The anti-adhesive activity of the biosurfactant at different concentrations was significant against all the strains and depended on the micro-organism tested. The results showed an effective reduction in the initial deposition rates, and the number of bacterial cells adhering after 4 h, for all micro-organisms tested at the 4 g l(-1) undiluted rhamnolipid solution. Maximum initial reduction of adhesion rate (an average of 66%) occurred for Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 and Candida tropicalis GB 9/9. The number of cells adhering after 4 h on silicone rubber conditioned with biosurfactant was reduced to 48% for Staphylococcus epidermidis GB 9/6, <e>Strep</e>. salivarius GB 24/9, Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 and C. tropicalis GB 9/9 in comparison to controls. Perfusing the flow chamber with biosurfactant containing solution followed by the passage of a liquid-air interface, to investigate detachment of micro-organisms adhering to silicone rubber, produced high detachment (96%) of adhered cells for all micro-organisms studied, except for Staph. aureus GB 2/1 (67%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It is concluded that biosurfactant represent suitable compounds that should be considered in developing future strategies to prevent the microbial colonization of silicone rubber voice prostheses.",M1
16333086,"Identification of 43 Streptococcus species by pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpB gene.Pyrosequencing technology was evaluated for identification of species within the Streptococcus genus. Two variable regions in the rnpB gene, which encodes the RNA subunit of endonuclease P, were sequenced in two reactions. Of 43 species, all could be identified to the species level except strains of the species pairs Streptococcus anginosus/S. constellatus and S. infantis/S. peroris. A total of 113 blood culture isolates were identified by pyrosequencing analysis of partial rnpB sequences. All but eight isolates could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species when the first 30 nucleotides of the two regions were compared to an rnpB database comprising 107 streptococcal strains. Principal coordinate analysis of sequence variation of strains from viridans group streptococci resulted in species-specific clusters for the mitis and the salivarius groups but not for the anginosus group. The identification capacity of pyrosequencing was compared to the biochemical test systems VITEK 2 and Rapid ID 32 <e>Strep</e>. The concordance between pyrosequencing and VITEK 2 was 75%, and for Rapid ID 32 Strep the corresponding figure was 77%. Isolates with discrepant identifications in the three methods were subjected to entire rnpB DNA sequence analysis that confirmed the identifications by pyrosequencing. In conclusion, pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpB gene can reliably identify Streptococcus species with high resolution.",M1
16162525,"Simultaneous detection of mastitis pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, and Streptococcus agalactiae by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction.The objective of this study was to develop a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for simultaneous detection of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis directly from milk. A genetic marker specific for Staph. aureus was used for primers and dual-labeled probe design. The target for <e>Strep</e>. agalactiae primers and dual-labeled probe was selected from the cfb gene encoding the Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen factor. The plasminogen activator gene was the target for primers and dual-labeled probe design for Strep. uberis. Quarter milk samples (n = 192) were analyzed by the multiplex real-time PCR assay and conventional microbiological methods. An additional 57 quarter milk samples were analyzed in a separate real-time PCR assay for Strep. agalactiae only. Using an overnight enrichment step, the real-time PCR technique correctly identified 96.4% of all quarter milk samples; 91.7% of Staph. aureus, 98.2% of Strep. agalactiae, and 100% of Strep. uberis. Results of conventional microbiological methods were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex real-time PCR procedure. The sensitivity of the procedure to correctly identify Staph. aureus, Strep. agalactiae, and Strep. uberis directly from milk was 95.5%, and the specificity was 99.6%. Results of this study indicate that the multiplex real-time PCR procedure has the potential to be a valuable diagnostic technique for simultaneous identification of Staph. aureus, Strep. agalactiae, and Strep. uberis directly from quarter milk samples.",M1
16162522,"Antibacterial effect of caprylic acid and monocaprylin on major bacterial mastitis pathogens.Bovine mastitis is the most significant economic drain on the worldwide dairy industry. Concerns regarding poor cure rates, emergence of bacterial resistance, and residues in milk necessitate development of alternative therapeutic approaches to antibiotics for treatment of mastitis. A variety of free fatty acids and their monoglycerides have been reported to exert antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms. The objective of our study was to examine the efficacy of caprylic acid, a short-chain fatty acid, and its monoglyceride, monocaprylin, to inactivate common mastitis pathogens, including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Milk samples containing 50 mM or 100 mM caprylic acid, and 25 mM or 50 mM monocaprylin were inoculated separately with a 3-isolate mixture of each of the 5 pathogens, and incubated at 39 degrees C. Populations of surviving bacteria were determined at 0 min, 1 min, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h of incubation. Both caprylic acid and monocaprylin reduced all 5 pathogens by &gt;5.0 log cfu/mL after 6 h of incubation. Among the bacterial species tested, <e>Strep</e>. agalactiae, Strep. dysgalactiae, and Strep. uberis were most sensitive, and E. coli was most tolerant to caprylic acid and monocaprylin. Results of this study indicate that caprylic acid and monocaprylin should be evaluated as alternatives or adjuncts to antibiotics as intra-mammary infusion to treat bovine mastitis.",M1
16127133,"Treatment of persistent intramammary infections with Streptococcus uberis in dairy cows.A survey was conducted of the prevalence of environmental pathogens, especially Streptococcus uberis, as causes of clinical mastitis in dairy cows. The response of intramammary infections with S uberis to conventional treatment was monitored by taking milk samples for bacteriology and somatic cell counting seven, 14 and 21 days after the treatment. The results showed that 51 per cent of the infections failed to respond, and the odds of cases failing to respond was significantly increased when the individual quarter somatic cell count seven days after the treatment was greater than 201,000 cells/ml. Ninety-six per cent of the suspected S uberis isolates identified by culture were confirmed as S uberis by using the api 20 <e>Strep</e> system. Restriction endonuclease fingerprinting was used to type the strains of S uberis isolated from 75 milk samples from 32 cows. Analysis showed that 96 per cent of the cases of S uberis that failed to respond to conventional treatment were persistent infections with one strain rather than reinfections with different strains. The persistent cases of S uberis were treated further with an extended course of intramammary preparations containing either procaine penicillin with dihydrostreptomycin or cefquinome. There was no significant difference between the cure rates achieved by the two preparations, and 55 per cent of the cases that had failed to respond to conventional treatment responded to the additional treatment.",M1
15633665,"Mastitis-causing streptococci are important contributors to bacterial counts in raw bulk tank milk.The objective of this study was to probe the contribution of streptococci to the microbial quality of raw milk. Over a 5-month period, bulk tank milk samples from 48 New York State dairy farms were analyzed qualitatively for bacterial ecology and quantitatively for total bacterial, streptococcal, staphylococcal, and gram-negative bacterial counts. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the contribution of differential counts to total bacterial counts. Streptococci, staphylococci, and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69, 3, and 3% of total bacterial count variability, respectively. Randomly selected Streptococcus isolates from each bulk tank milk sample were identified to species by means of the API 20 <e>STREP</e> identification system. The most commonly identified streptococcal species were Streptococcus uberis, Aerococcus viridans, and Streptococcus agalactiae, which were detected in 81, 50, and 31% of 48 bulk tank samples, respectively. For five herds, S. uberis isolates from bulk tank milk and individual cows were characterized by PvuII ribotyping. A farm-specific dominant ribotype was found in each bulk tank sample, and that ribotype was isolated from at least one cow within each herd of origin. Bacteriological and strain typing data indicate that control of streptococci, specifically mastitis-causing species, is important for improvement of the microbial quality of raw milk in New York State.",M1
15347749,"Use of community genome arrays (CGAs) to assess the effects of Acacia angustissima on rumen ecology.This research developed a community genome array (CGA) to assess the effects of Acacia angustissima on rumen microbiology. A. angustissima produces non-protein amino acids as well as tannins, which may be toxic to animals, and CGA was used to assess the effects of this plant on the ecology of the rumen. CGAs were developed using a 7.5 cmx2.5 cm nylon membrane format that included up to 96 bacterial genomes. It was possible to separately hybridize large numbers of membranes at once using this mini-membrane format. Pair-wise cross-hybridization experiments were conducted to determine the degree of cross-hybridization between strains; cross-hybridization occurred between strains of the same species, but little cross-reactivity was observed among different species. CGAs were successfully used to survey the microbial communities of animals consuming an A. angustissima containing diet but quantification was not precise. To properly quantify and validate the CGA, Fibrobacter and Ruminococcus populations were independently assessed using 16S rDNA probes to extracted rRNA. The CGA detected an increase in these populations as acacia increased in the diet, which was confirmed by rRNA analysis. There was a great deal of variation among strains of the same species in how they responded to A. angustissima. However, in general Selenomonas strains tended to be resistant to the tannins in the acacia while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was sensitive. On the other hand some species, like streptococci, varied. Streptococcus bovis-like strains were sensitive to an increase in acacia in the diet while Streptococcus gallolyticus-like strains were resistant. <e>Strep</e>. gallolyticus has independently been shown to be resistant to tannins. It is concluded that there is significant variation in tannin resistance between strains of the same species. This implies that there are specific molecular mechanisms at play that are independent of the phylogenetic position of the organism.",M1
15131171,"Comparison of conventional and molecular methods for identification of aerobic catalase-negative gram-positive cocci in the clinical laboratory.Over a period of 18 months we have evaluated the use of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence analysis as a means of identifying aerobic catalase-negative gram-positive cocci in the clinical laboratory. A total of 171 clinically relevant strains were studied. The results of molecular analyses were compared with those obtained with a commercially available phenotypic identification system (API 20 <e>Strep</e> system; bioMérieux sa, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Phenotypic characterization identified 67 (39%) isolates to the species level and 32 (19%) to the genus level. Seventy-two (42%) isolates could not be discriminated at any taxonomic level. In comparison, 16S rDNA sequencing identified 138 (81%) isolates to the species level and 33 (19%) to the genus level. For 42 of 67 isolates assigned to a species with the API 20 Strep system, molecular analyses yielded discrepant results. Upon further analysis it was concluded that among the 42 isolates with discrepant results, 16S rDNA sequencing was correct for 32 isolates, the phenotypic identification was correct for 2 isolates, and the results for 8 isolates remained unresolved. We conclude that 16S rDNA sequencing is an effective means for the identification of aerobic catalase-negative gram-positive cocci. With the exception of Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococci, we propose the use of 16S rDNA sequence analysis if adequate species identification is of concern.",M1
14962128,"Evaluation of bacterial communities belonging to natural whey starters for Grana Padano cheese by length heterogeneity-PCR.AIMS: To detect bacteria present in controlled dairy ecosystems with defined composition by length-heterogeneity (LH)-PCR. LH-PCR allows to distinguish different organisms on the basis of natural variations in the length of 16S rRNA gene sequences. METHODS AND RESULTS: LH-PCR was applied to depict population structure of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species recoverable from Grana Padano cheese whey starters. Typical bacterial species present in the LAB community were evidenced and well discriminated. Small differences in species composition, e.g. the frequent finding of Streptococcus thermophilus and the constant presence of thermophilic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus helveticus, Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis/bulgaricus and Lact. fermentum) were reliably highlighted. Specificity of LH-PCR was confirmed by species-specific PCR from total DNA of the cultures. CONCLUSIONS: LH-PCR is a useful tool to monitor microbial composition and population dynamics in dairy starter cultures. When present, non-dominant bacterial species present in the whey starters, such as <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus, can easily be visualized and characterized without isolating and cultivating single strains. A similar approach can be applied to more complex dairy ecosystems such as milk or cheese curd. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Community members and differences in population structure of controlled dairy ecosystems such as whey starters for hard cheeses can be evaluated and compared in a relative easy, fast, reliable and highly reproducible way.",M1
14672176,"Results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination in Wisconsin from 1994 to 2001.The objective of this study was to examine the characteristics of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory between 1994 and 2001. Results (n = 83,650) of microbiological testing of milk samples (n = 77,172) submitted to the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory from January 1994 until June 2001 were analyzed. Submissions included milk samples obtained from cases of clinical and subclinical mastitis as well as samples obtained for mastitis surveillance programs. Results were recorded as no growth, contaminated, or identified as specific bacterial pathogens. Statistical analysis was performed to determine trends in the isolation of mastitis pathogens. The proportion of samples identified as contaminated decreased from 20.6 (1997) to 9.5% (2001). The proportion of samples coded as no growth increased from 22.6 (1994) to 49.7% (2001). Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus decreased from 17.7% (1994) of isolates to 9.7% (2001), while isolation of Streptococcus agalactiae decreased from 8.1 (1994) to 3.0% (2001). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 12.7 to 17.5%, environmental Streptococcus spp. were isolated from 11.6 to 20.1%, and Escherichia coli were isolated from 3.1 to 6.7% of all isolates. No growth and contaminated samples comprised almost 50% of total submissions, and it is important that producers have proper expectations when submitting milk samples. The proportion of isolates identified as Staph. aureus and <e>Strep</e>. agalactiae decreased, suggesting the proportion of contagious bacteria causing mastitis has decreased. Environmental and contagious pathogens demonstrated characteristic differences by season.",M1
14633106,"Detection of Streptococcus anginosus from saliva by real-time polymerase chain reaction.AIMS: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of Streptococcus anginosus in periodontitis patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The salivary levels of <e>Strep</e>. anginosus were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Streptococcus anginosus was detected in 28 of 37 (75.6%) of periodontitis patients and in three of the 20 (15%) healthy subjects. The mean values for bleeding on probing and probing depth in positive patients were statistically higher than those in negative patients. A significant decrease in Strep. anginosus levels was observed after periodontal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although the levels of Strep. anginosus are extremely low, they may reflect the status of periodontal health. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Real-time PCR is a useful method for obtaining the relative quantities of Strep. anginosus from saliva samples and for monitoring the effect of therapy.",M1
12892133,"Streptococcus oligofermentans sp. nov., a novel oral isolate from caries-free humans.Five streptococcal strains were isolated from dental plaque and saliva of caries-free humans. The cells were gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile cocci that were arranged in short chains. The strains were catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic and produced lactic acid exclusively from glucose fermentation. Biochemical analysis that used both conventional methods and the commercial API 20 <e>Strep</e> system showed that the five strains fermented only a few kinds of sugar. The mean DNA G + C content of the five novel strains was 39.5 +/- 0.8 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequence homology indicated that the new isolates represented a novel member of the mitis group of the genus Streptococcus, related most closely to the recently described species Streptococcus sinensis. DNA-DNA relatedness between novel strain LMG 21535T and type strains of phylogenetically related species of oral streptococci was 7.1-16.4%. Therefore a novel Streptococcus species, Streptococcus oligofermentans sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is LMG 21535T=AS 1.3089T.",M1
12691195,"Streptococcus iniae: serological differences, presence of capsule and resistance to immune serum killing.The biochemical profiles, presence of capsule, outer membrane protein profiles and serological interactions of isolates of Streptococcus iniae obtained from different geographical and fish host origins were examined. The isolates had very similar biochemical profiles using API 20 <e>Strep</e> but varied as to whether they were arginine dihydrolase-negative, -positive or -intermediate (AD-ve, AD+ve, AD+/-ve, respectively). Representatives of each AD type were compared in subsequent experiments. All types possessed a polysaccharide capsule. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of outer membrane proteins or whole cells revealed no difference in banding patterns between isolates. All isolates were resistant to trout normal and specific immune serum and grew well in the presence of added fresh normal serum. Serological analyses of the isolates revealed antigenic differences. Trout antiserum against the AD+ve isolate did not agglutinate the AD-ve or AD+/-ve isolates, while antisera against the latter 2 types showed low agglutinating activity with all 3 isolates. When whole live cells of AD-ve and AD+ve isolates were dot-blotted, antiserum to the AD+ve isolate did not stain the AD-ve isolate, but antiserum to the AD-ve isolate stained both AD types. However, if the cells were pre-treated with Proteinase K (to remove surface-exposed protein antigens), the AD+ve isolate was stained only by its homologous antiserum. These results suggest that while certain protein antigens of the different AD type strains are immunologically cross-reactive, the capsular antigens appear to be AD type-specific. Furthermore, the results suggest that the cross-reactive antigens on the AD-ve isolate are effectively hidden by the strain-specific capsule, while they are partially exposed on the AD+ve isolate.",M1
12574255,"Analysis of a viridans group strain reveals a case of bacteremia due to lancefield group G alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp equisimilis in a patient with pyomyositis and reactive arthritis.Streptococcus dysgalactiae is classified by a combination of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics into Lancefield group C alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and Lancefield group C, group G, and group L beta-hemolytic Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. In this study, we report the isolation of a catalase-negative, alpha-hemolytic, optochin- and bacitracin-resistant viridans group strain, which does not grow in 10 or 40% bile, on MacConkey agar or bile esculin agar, or in 6% NaCl, from the blood culture of a 73-year-old woman with pyomyositis and poststreptococcal reactive arthritis. Lancefield grouping revealed that the strain was a group G streptococcus. The Vitek system (GPI) showed that it was unidentified, and the API system (20 <e>STREP</e>) showed that it was 95.7% S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that it was a strain of S. dysgalactiae. Based on phylogenetic affiliation with 16S rRNA gene or GroEL amino acid (another bacterial gene, in addition to 16S rRNA gene, that is highly conserved) sequences, the strain is most closely related to Lancefield group C beta-hemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. PCR amplification and sequencing of the streptolysin S structural gene (sagA) and M protein gene (emm) hypervariable region showed the presence of these suspected primary virulence factors. Further studies would delineate whether the isolate is just a hemolysin-deficient variant of group G beta-hemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis or a novel type of S. dysgalactiae. The present case showed that group G alpha-hemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis can be associated with serious invasive infection and poststreptococcal sequelae.",M1
12390494,"Genetic diversity in Swiss cheese starter cultures assessed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and arbitrarily primed PCR.AIMS: To assess intraspecific genetic heterogeneity among commercial Swiss cheese starter culture strains of Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Propionibacterium freudenreichii and to compare the efficacy of two genetic typing methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two genetic typing methods, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR), were used. Nine <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus strains revealed eight PFGE and five AP-PCR genotypes. Seventeen Lactobacillus strains yielded 16 and five genotypes by PFGE and AP-PCR, respectively. Eleven Propionibacterium strains yielded 10 PFGE genotypes. Cluster analysis of PFGE profiles generated similarity coefficients for Strep. thermophilus, Lact. helveticus and Prop. freudenreichii strains of 29.5%, 60.3%, and 30.5%, respectively. Milk acidification rates for Strep. thermophilus and Lact. helveticus were determined. CONCLUSIONS: Pulsed field gel electrophoresis is more discriminatory than AP-PCR. The Lact. helveticus group is more homogeneous than the other species examined. Strains with &gt; 87% similarity by PFGE consistently had the same acidification rate and AP-PCR profile. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacterial strains sold for Swiss cheese manufacture in the United States are genetically diverse. Clustering of genetically related bacteria may be useful in identifying new strains with industrially relevant traits.",M1
12147076,"Genetic diversity and technological properties of Streptococcus thermophilus strains isolated from dairy products.AIMS: To evaluate the genetic diversity and the technological properties of 44 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus isolated from dairy products. Methods METHODS AND RESULTS: Strains were analysed for some relevant technological properties, i.e. exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, growth kinetic in skim milk medium, urease activity and galactose fermentation. The EPS production, determined by evaluating the colour of the colonies grown in ruthenium red milk agar, was observed in 50% of the analysed strains. Urease activity, determined by colorimetric and conductimetric methods, showed that 91% of the isolates, all except four, could hydrolyse urea. A conductimetric approach was also used for the evaluation of the overall metabolic behaviour in milk of <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus strains and the differences observed allowed grouping of the strains in seven different clusters. A total of 11 strains were able to produce acid in presence of galactose. Genetic diversity of Streptococcus thermophilus strains, evaluated by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA fingerprinting (RAPD) and amplified epsC-D restriction analysis, allowed the identification of 21 different genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison between the genotypic and phenotypic data highlights an interesting correlation between some important technological properties and well-defined genotypes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The genetic and technological characterization carried out on several Strep. thermophilus strains of dairy origin should expand the knowledge on this important lactic acid bacteria species and lead to a simple, rapid, and reliable identification of strains on the basis of well-defined biotechnological properties.",M1
12120707,"Selection of dairy bacterial strains as probiotics for oral health.The aim of the present study was to select bacterial strains with potential properties as oral probiotics, namely for the prevention of dental caries. We examined 23 dairy microorganisms, out of which we identified two Streptococcus thermophilus and two Lactcoccus lactis strains that were able to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads to the same extent as Streptococcus sobrinus OMZ176. Two of them, <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus NCC1561 and Lactoc. lactis ssp. lactis NCC2211, were further successfully incorporated into a biofilm mimicking the dental plaque. Furthermore, they could grow in such a biofilm together with five strains of oral bacterial species, representative of supragingival plaque. In this system, Lactoc. lactis NCC2211 was able to modulate the growth of the oral bacteria, and in particular to diminish the colonization of Streptococcus oralis OMZ607, Veillonella dispar OMZ493, Actinomyces naeslundii OMZ745 and of the cariogenic Strep. sobrinus OMZ176. These findings encourage further research with selected non-pathogenic dairy bacterial strains with the aim to decrease the cariogenic potential of dental plaque.",M1
12086045,"Trends in antibacterial susceptibility of mastitis pathogens during a seven-year period.Milk samples collected from dairy cattle suspected of having mastitis were submitted to the Microbiology Laboratory of the Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory, Michigan State University, for bacteriologic culture. A total of 2778 isolates, from the years 1994 to 2000, were isolated, identified, and subjected to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion method, in accordance with National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) standards. Isolates included in this study were Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcesens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proportion of bacterial isolates determined to be susceptible did not change during the 7-yr period for the majority of bacterial-antibacterial interactions tested. However, analysis for linear trend in proportions determined that there were increases in the proportion of S. aureus isolates that were susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin. For <e>Strep</e>. uberis, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred for oxacillin, sulfa-trimethoprim, gentamicin, and pirlimycin, and a decrease in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with penicillin. For Strep. dysgalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with erythromycin, gentamicin, sulfa-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. For Strep. agalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with sulfa-trimethoprim. Among E. coli isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ampicillin and cephalothin. Among K pneumoniae isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ceftiofur. Overall, there was no indication of increased resistance of mastitis isolates to antibacterials that are commonly used in dairy cattle.",M1
12067374,"Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (PepX) from Streptococcus thermophilus strain ACA-DC 4.AIMS: To clone and sequence the pepX gene from Streptococcus thermophilus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three pairs of primers were used in polymerase chain reactions using as template the total DNA from <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus ACA-DC 4 in order to amplify, clone and sequence the pepX gene. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 2268 nucleotides encoding a protein of 755 amino acids. The calculated molecular mass of 85 632 Da agreed well with the apparent molecular mass of 80 000 Da previously determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration for the monomeric form of the purified enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: The pepX gene from Strep. thermophilus ACA-DC 4 was cloned and sequenced. The PepX protein showed significant sequence similarity with PepX enzymes from other lactic acid bacteria and contained a motif which was almost identical with the active site motif of the serine-dependent PepX family. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: There are economic and technological incentives for accelerating and controlling the process of cheese ripening. To achieve this, starters may be modified by introducing appropriate genes from other food-grade bacteria. New or additional peptidase activities may alter or improve the proteolytic properties of lactic acid bacteria.",M1
12018415,"Capsule formation by nonropy starter cultures affects the viscoelastic properties of yogurt during structure formation.The aim of this work was to study the structure formation of yogurt made with cultures containing ropy Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (R), capsule-forming nonropy Streptococcus thermophilus (CNR), and noncapsule-forming nonropy cultures (NCNR). Similar gelation profiles were shown for milk fermented by ropy and nonropy lactic cultures. The gelation point occurred at lower pH values in milk fermented with R or NCNR compared to that of milk fermented with CNR culture. Differences between capsule forming ropy and nonropy cultures were observed in the aggregation behavior of the caseins. Gels made with R culture had the highest maximum in loss tangent (tan delta). However, this maximum occurred at the highest pH value when CNR culture was used. The earlier gelation of milk fermented by the encapsulated nonropy strain of <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus resulted in increased structure rearrangement as the pH dropped, interfering with the formation of a more compact structure.",M1
11980942,"Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMérieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 <e>Strep</e> for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.",M1
11863269,"Rapid identification of Streptococcus intermedius by PCR with the ily gene as a species marker gene.Streptococcus intermedius belongs to the anginosus group of streptococci (AGS) and is associated with endogenous infections leading to abscesses in the oral cavity and at deepseated sites, such as the brain and liver. Two other species, S. anginosus and S. constellatus, and some presently unnamed taxa, are also classified as AGS. Recently, S. constellatus subsp. pharyngis, a new subspecies with biochemical characteristics similar to S. intermedius, was described with the potential for causing confusion when trying to identify isolates of these two species routinely with commercial identification kits, such as Rapid ID32 <e>Strep</e> and Fluo-Card Milleri. To correctly identify S. intermedius, this study attempted to develop an accurate PCR identification system with the ily gene as a species marker. This approach relies on amplification of an 819-bp fragment of the ily gene and its 3'-flanking region and is shown here to be specific for S. intermedius strains among all other streptococcal species. Moreover, this PCR system was applicable in direct rapid PCR with whole bacterial cells and TaKaRa Z-Taq (TaKaRa), a highly efficient DNA polymerase, as the template and DNA amplification enzyme, respectively.",M1
11851809,"Development of a minimal chemically-defined medium for the exponential growth of Streptococcus thermophilus.AIMS: The present work aimed to define a minimal chemically-defined medium which could sustain the growth of most (if not all) strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. METHODS AND RESULTS: A minimal medium containing 20 components, including one carbohydrate source, six amino acids, two metallic ions, six vitamins and urea allowed for growth of 13 out of 15 <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus strains. Growth of the two last strains required the presence of additional amino acids, the number of which depended on the strain. Growth rates of the strains in the minimal medium ranged from 0.38 to 0.64 h(-1), and final populations were about 10(8) cfu ml(-1). CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus thermophilus appears much less demanding than other lactic acid bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The definition of such a growth medium will be very useful for metabolic flux studies as well as peptide transport studies.",M1
11849364,"Composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.AIMS: To identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tDNA-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on Columbia CNA blood agar. Sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. Forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as Enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while E. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates). Minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus, Streptococcus alactolyticus and <e>Strep</e>. gallolyticus. Contrary to the species description of E. columbae and E. cecorum, some of the strains were found to be motile. Certain other minor differences with the species description of E. columbae are also indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Enterococcus columbae is the major Gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. Certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. The potentially pathogenic Strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis are rare in pigeons. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. These are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.",M1
11849358,"Exopolysaccharide production by Streptococcus thermophilus SY: production and preliminary characterization of the polymer.AIMS: To evaluate the effect of yeast extract (YE) concentration, temperature and pH on growth and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production in a whey-based medium by Streptococcus thermophilus SY and to characterize the partially purified EPS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Factorial experiments and empirical model building were used to optimize fermentation conditions and the chemical composition, average molecular weight (MW) and rheological properties of aqueous dispersions of the EPS were determined. Exopolysaccharide production was growth associated and was higher (152 mg l(-1)) at pH 6.4 and 36 degrees C with 4 g l(-1) YE. High performance size exclusion chromatography of the partially purified EPS showed two peaks, with a weight average MW of 2 x 10(6) and 5 x 10(4), respectively. The EPS was a heteropolysaccharide, with a glucose : galactose : rhamnose ratio of 2 : 4.5 : 1. Its water dispersions had a pseudoplastic behaviour and showed a higher viscosity of xanthan solutions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The fermentation conditions and some properties of an EPS produced by <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus, a dairy starter organism, were described.",M1
11825576,"Inhibitory effect of ZnCl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.Although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of Zn on different organisms under both fixed pH and free-fall conditions. Here, the effect of ZnCl(2) on Streptococcus salivarius, <e>Strep</e>. mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. pH-stat experiments were performed at pH 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; pH-fall experiments started at pH 7. In both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for Zn and lactate determinations. Under pH-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by Zn most strongly in Strep. sobrinus and Strep. salivarius. In terms of total acid production averted, however, the effect of Zn under both pH-stat and pH-fall conditions was clearly greatest with Strep. salivarius. A. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under pH-stat conditions. Cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mM initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mM). Packed cell layers responded to Zn quite differently from suspensions, the pH often falling in the presence of 1mM Zn at a rate similar to the no Zn control. As streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both pH-stat and pH-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as A. naeslundii.",M1
11722674,"Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of Streptococcus thermophilus strains isolated from dairy products.AIMS: Forty strains of Streptococcus thermophilus isolated from dairy products were identified and typed by a polyphasic approach which included phenotypic and genotypic criteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strains were identified by sugar fermentation pattern and species-specific PCR. Phenotypic diversity was evaluated by a chemometric model taking into account some biochemical characteristics (e.g. acidifying and peptidase activities) of technological interest. Genotypic diversity was evidenced by PCR fingerprinting. The overall phenotypic and genotypic information was elaborated on a multivariate statistical basis by principal components analysis and cluster analysis, respectively. When acidifying and peptidase activities were considered, PCA indicated that most of the strains isolated from Pecorino Toscano cheese were separable from the others. Similarly, most of the starter culture strains tended to separate from the cheese isolates. CONCLUSIONS: A wide strain heterogeneity among <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus strains isolated from dairy products was observed. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A computerized analysis of genotypic and phenotypic information could be applied successfully to differentiate and characterize reliably and rapidly isolates occurring in different dairy products and to comprehend the technological role of specific Strep. thermophilus strains in dairy technology.",M1
11491323,"Streptococcus australis sp. nov., a novel oral streptococcus.Strains of streptococci were isolated from the mouths of children attending the United Dental Hospital, Sydney, Australia. These strains were analysed biochemically using the Rapid ID32 <e>Strep</e> microsystem, were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridization with other members of the oral streptococci and had their 165 rRNA analysed. On the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization, their nearest relative was Streptococcus parasanguinis, whereas, on the basis of 16S rRNA analysis, it was Streptococcus infantis. The name Streptococcus australis sp. nov. is proposed for the new species. The type strain is AI-1T (= ATCC 700641T = NCTC 13166T).",M1
11442814,"Detection of extracellular bound proteinase in EPS-producing lactic acid bacteria cultures on skim milk agar.AIMS: Skim milk agar was developed to investigate extracellular cell-bound proteinase in yogurt cultures, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Lact. bulgaricus cultures produced more extracellular cell-bound proteinase than did <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus cultures. Strong positive correlations between the size of the exopolysaccharide (EPS) layer and extracellular cell-bound proteinase were found for both Streptococcus and Lactobacillus cultures. CONCLUSION: Strong positive linear relationships existed between the EPS size and colony size and the diameter of clear zone and colony size for Streptococcus cultures, whereas weak positive linear relationships were observed for Lactobacillus cultures. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These data are useful to validate the relationship between extracellular proteinase and the EPS size of LAB. Also, a convenient medium to detect the presence of extracellular cell-bound proteinase of LAB is valuable for dairy industries.",M1
11412350,"Identification of Streptococcus salivarius by PCR and DNA probe.AIMS: To establish species-specific PCR and DNA probe methods for Streptococcus salivarius and to clarify the distribution of dextranase in oral isolates of <e>Strep</e>. salivarius. METHODS AND RESULTS: A pair of PCR primers and a DNA probe were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of the dextranase gene of Strep. salivarius JCM5707. Both the PCR primer and the DNA probe specifically detected Strep. salivarius but none of the other oral streptococci (23 strains of 13 species). The primer and the probe were capable of detecting 1 pg and 1 ng of the genomic DNA, respectively, purified from Strep. salivarius JCM5707. All oral isolates (130 strains from 12 subjects) of Strep. salivarius from human saliva were positive by both methods. CONCLUSION: The present PCR and DNA probe methods are highly specific to Strep. salivarius and are useful for the its detection and identification of this bacterium. The dextranase widely distributes among oral isolates of Strep. salivarius. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The DNA sequence of a dextranase gene present in the genome of Strep. salivarius is useful as the target DNA of the species-specific PCR and DNA probe.",M1
11320122,"Development of Streptococcus thermophilus lacZ as a reporter gene for Candida albicans.The study of gene regulation in many organisms has been facilitated by the development of reporter genes. The authors report the use of lacZ from Streptococcus thermophilus, a gene encoding a beta-galactosidase, as a reporter for the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. As test cases, <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus lacZ was placed under control of three different C. albicans promoters: MAL2 (maltase), inducible by maltose; HWP1 (hyphal cell wall protein), induced by conditions that promote filamentous growth; and ACT1 (actin). These constructs were each integrated into the C. albicans genome and beta-galactosidase activity was readily detected from these strains, but only under the appropriate growth conditions. Beta-galactosidase activity could be detected by several methods: quantitative liquid assays using permeabilized cells, colorimetric assays of colonies replicated to paper filters, and in situ coloration of colonies growing on medium containing the indicator X-Gal. These results show the usefulness of STREP: thermophilus lacZ as a monitor of gene regulation in this medically important yeast.",M1
11123479,"Characterization of phage receptors in Streptococcus thermophilus using purified cell walls obtained by a simple protocol.A simple protocol was designed and applied to obtain Streptococcus thermophilus purified cell walls. To identify the structures involved in phage adsorption, the cell walls of two <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus strains were treated with sodium dodecyl sulphate and proteinase K. These treatments did not reduce the adsorption of phages CYM and 0BJ to the cell walls of Strep. thermophilus YSD10 and Strep. thermophilus BJ15, respectively. However, phage binding was reduced when the cell envelopes were treated with mutanolysin or trichloroacetic acid 5%, suggesting that the phage receptor component is part of the peptidoglycan or a polymer closely linked to it. The ability of several saccharides to inactivate both phages was also assayed. These phage inhibition experiments suggested that the phage CYM adsorbed to a component involving glucosamine and rhamnose, while glucosamine and ribose interfered with the adsorption of phage 0BJ.",M1
11054158,"The formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.A chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). Eleven bacterial species (Streptococcus gordonii, <e>Strep</e>. mitis I, Strep. mutans, Strep. oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus casei, Neisseria subflava, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. A flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. The biofilm produced from state-1 showed a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 Pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 Pa). The biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. Gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while Gram-negative species were predominant in state-2.",M1
10966229,"Haemolysin-deficient variants of Streptococcus pyogenes and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis may be overlooked as aetiological agents of pharyngitis.Variants of large colony beta-haemolytic Lancefield group A, C and G streptococci that are non-haemolytic or alpha-haemolytic on sheep blood agar have been detected in clinical specimens due to their enhanced haemolytic activity when grown on a new selective and differential blood agar medium containing colistin, nalidixic acid and pH 7.5-adjusted PIPES buffer (CNA-P). The large colony Lancefield group C and G isolates were identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis by API 20 <e>Strep</e> classification and 16S rDNA profiling. The haemolytic activity of these variants on various blood agar media, including CNA-P, was closely similar to that of known streptolysin S-defective mutants of S. pyogenes and was blocked by addition of cholesterol, a specific inhibitor of the streptolysin O family of haemolysins. As haemolysin variants could be detected in large numbers in cultures from patients with clinical symptoms of pharyngitis it is suggested that they may function as primary pathogens in such infections. The high frequency with which haemolysin variants were isolated from clinical specimens during a 3-month trial (3%, 13% and 10%, respectively, of group A, C and G streptococcal isolates) indicated that a substantial proportion of streptococcal infections may go undetected if only conventional sheep blood agar media are used in clinical laboratories for the detection of beta-haemolytic streptococci. As haemolysin variants have been implicated in the development of serious streptococcal sequelae, further investigation of the full extent of their contribution to streptococcal disease is indicated.",M1
10869478,"Effects of Streptococcus crista and human saliva on the viability of Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953.Associations with facultative species might help planktonic oral anaerobes survive when they traverse saliva. This study investigated whether co-aggregation with Streptococcus crista ATCC 51110 enhanced the viability of Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953. Two tubes each of co-aggregates and Fus. nucleatum ATCC 10953 alone were prepared. One of each set was resuspended in buffer, and the other in clarified saliva from each of 20 donors. After 1 h, cells were stained for viability. The median percentage of viable Fus. nucleatum ATCC 10953 in buffer with <e>Strep</e>. crista (86%) was significantly higher (p=0.04) than in buffer alone (77%). A similar trend was observed for saliva with Strep. crista (81%) and saliva alone (74%), although that difference was not significant (p=0.41). The median percentage of Fus. nucleatum co-aggregated in buffer (44%) was significantly reduced after incubation in saliva (16%) (p&lt;0.0002). No such change was seen when saliva was replaced with purified salivary proline-rich glycoprotein, which can bind both species. For co-aggregate suspensions, there was no difference in the viability of fusobacteria that were or were not in direct contact with Strep. crista. In both cases, viability was significantly reduced in saliva relative to buffer. Strep. crista may enhance the viability of planktonic Fus. nucleatum ATCC 10953, but it is not yet clear whether that requires co-aggregation. Transmission of fusobacteria through saliva could depend on the interplay between protective factors, such as the presence of streptococci, and antimicrobial factors, which kill cells or disassociate co-aggregates.",M1

Baye's theorem was used to validate tests. Reactions from micromethods were clear and easily read. Identification of 229 strains of streptococci and enterococci was correct for most species with 98.7% species with 99.3% sensitivity. 41 strains of staphylococci were also correctly identified with 85.2% of specificity and 97.68% of sensitivity.",M1
10790086,"Evaluation of the PASCO <e>strep</e> plus broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility panels for testing Streptococcus pneumoniae and other Streptococcal species.Antimicrobial resistance continues to increase worldwide among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and other species of streptococci. Increasing rates of penicillin resistance, particularly in viridans group streptococci, and resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents, including beta-lactams, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones, in pneumococci have increased the importance of having accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing results for guiding therapy. One commercial method of assessing resistance in streptococci is the PASCO Strep Plus panel. This broth microdilution-based method has recently been expanded to include a variety of newer antimicrobial agents. Therefore, we compared the results of the new PASCO Strep Plus panels for 26 antimicrobial agents against the results generated using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) broth microdilution reference method for 75 pneumococci and 68 other streptococcal isolates. Only 4 (0.2%) very major errors (all with pneumococci and each with a different antimicrobial agent) were observed. There were 5 (0.3%) major errors observed with pneumococci (each with a different antimicrobial agent), but only 1 major error with nonpneumococcal streptococci. All of the very major and major errors resolved on retesting. Of the 65 (3.9%) and 17 (1.6%) minor errors observed with pneumococci and other streptococci, respectively, all were within 1 dilution of the broth microdilution reference MIC result. Thus, the PASCO Strep Plus panel has comparable accuracy to the NCCLS broth microdilution reference method.",M1
10716621,"Electrical enhancement of Streptococcus gordonii biofilm killing by gentamicin.This electrical enhancement was demonstrated in an in vitro model. Streptococcus gordonii biofilms were grown for 6 days in continuous-flow reactors on one-tenth strength trypticase peptone broth. The biofilms attained a mean areal cell density of 2.4 x 10(8) c.f.u./cm2 and a thickness of approx. 19 microm. Biofilms exhibited characteristic resistance to killing by an antibiotic. When treated with 2 microg/ml gentamicin for 24 h, they exhibited a 0.84 log reduction in viable cell numbers; a 4.7 log reduction was measured in a planktonic culture. Killing of planktonic bacteria by this treatment was reduced to 1.2 log when an oxygen-scavenging enzyme was added to the medium. When a 2-mA direct current was applied during antibiotic treatment, biofilm killing increased to a 4.3 log reduction. Electrical current alone caused a 1.9 log reduction in biofilm cell counts. It is suggested that gentamicin was less effective against <e>Strep</e>. gordonii under anaerobic conditions than it was under aerobic conditions and that this can explain both the reduced susceptibility of the biofilm (due to oxygen depletion) and electrical enhancement of efficacy (due to oxygen generation by electrolysis).",M1
10716618,"In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and Arnica montana against oral pathogens.Arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. They possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. Although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. Also, the antimicrobial activity of Arnica has not been extensively investigated. Therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by Arnica and propolis extracts. Arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from Minas Gerais State were compared with controls. Fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: Candida albicans--NTCC 3736, F72; Staphylococcus aureus--ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis--ATCC 29212; Streptococcus sobrinus 6715; <e>Strep</e>. sanguis--ATCC 10556; Strep. cricetus--HS-6; Strep. mutans--Ingbritt 1600; Strep. mutans--OMZ 175; Actinomyces naeslundii--ATCC 12104, W 1053; Act. viscosus OMZ 105; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Porph. endodontalis and Prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. To assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. To assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 M sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. Arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. The propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p &lt; 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for Actinomyces spp. The Arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. Cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. The Arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for Strep. mutans and 15% for Strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same concentrations. Thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the Arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.",M1

10459773,"Deposition and retention of vital and dead Streptococcus sanguinis cells on glass surfaces in a flow-chamber system.The proportion of vital as compared with dead Streptococcus sanguinis cells attached to glass surfaces was monitored and related to varying proportions of planktonic vital as compared with dead <e>Strep</e>. sanguinis cells. In a flow chamber with six parallel-mounted glass plates, Strep. sanguinis was suspended in pretreated sterile human saliva. Deposition of Strep. sanguinis took place, with a proportion of vital sanguinis streptococci in saliva (%VSs) of 90%, 45% or 22.5%. After exposure times of 30, 60, 90, 120 and 240 min, adherent microorganisms were labelled with two fluorescence stains to differentiate between vital and dead bacteria. Proportions of vital attached streptococci (%VSa) were determined microscopically. Dead bacteria were detected on all glass plates. The %VSa at 30 min and 60 min was significantly lower than the baseline %VSs. During the course of a single run the %VSa frequently increased after either 30, 60 or 90 min without exceeding the %VSs at 4 h. %VSs was the only variable exerting a significant effect on %VSa at 30 and 60 min. It is suggested that during the initial events of microbial attachment the dead rather than vital Strep. sanguinis cells attach preferably to solid surfaces.",M1
10386308,"Determinants of success or failure in the elimination of major mastitis pathogens in selective dry cow therapy.Discriminant factors for the elimination of major pathogens (mainly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae) were identified from a randomized, double-blind, field study on dry cow therapy. From an original study of 686 cows, 269 fulfilled the criteria for this analysis: 93 from the control group, 83 from group C (treated with Benestermycin vet.  LEO ) and 93 from group D (treated with Leocillin with Dihydrostreptomycin vet.  LEO ). A  success  cow was defined as a cow that had all quarters healthy in two tests after dry period. Isolation of a major pathogen (mainly Staph. aureus or <e>Strep</e>. dysgalactiae) in any quarter in both samples after the dry period was defined as  failure.  Better elimination was associated with short-acting preparations (therapy D) rather than with long-acting therapy C (odds ratio = 0.32), as was a smaller mean value of the last three composite milk somatic cell counts (CMSCC) before dry cow therapy. Cows with a major pathogen in the right hind quarter at drying off or at least one case of acute clinical mastitis during the previous lactation were more likely to have a major pathogen in the next lactation (odds ratio = 4.1 and 3.6, respectively). Young cows without major pathogens at drying off should not be recommended for dry cow therapy, and cows with high CMSCC should be considered for culling if their profiles also show previous acute clinical mastitis in combination with generally high CMSCC and low cure rates in the herd.",M1
10222732,"[Evaluation of the usefulness of selected commercial systems for identification of Streptococcus species]The usefulness was assessed of three commercially available systems for rapid identification of streptococcal strains. The studied material comprised 68 strains of streptococci and enterococci (including 24 standard strains) belonging to serological groups: A (14 strains), B (10), C (11), D (10), F (3) and G (10), as well as 10 S. pneumoniae strains. The strains were isolated from throat, nasal, wound swabs, blood, pus of inpatients and throat and nasal swabs of outpatients. For the identification of streptococci 3 commercially available systems were used: API 20 <e>STREP</e> (bioMerieux, France), rapid ID 32 Strep (bioMerieux, France), Streptoplast PPL 18 (HTL, Poland). The determinations were done according to producer's instructions. The highest percent of correctly identified strains was obtained with the rapid ID 32 Strep--80.9%, with the API 20 STREP--76.4% strains were identified correctly and with the PPL 18--61.8%. The study showed that the API 20 STREP and rapid ID 32 STREP are suitable for the identification of streptococcal strains from groups: A, B, C, D, F and enterococci--group D. The proportions of correctly identified strains from these groups with the Streptoplast PPL 18 were lower than those determined with the bioMerieux systems.

The appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. Of the selective media, AMC, RMS, NPNL and BL-OG performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, <e>Strep</e>. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lact. acidophilus. However, of these four media, AMC was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents.

10063627,"Electrotransformation of industrial strains of Streptococcus thermophilus.A standard electroporation procedure was utilized to introduce a range of Gram-positive plasmid vectors into nine industrial strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. All the strains were transformable with at least two of the plasmids assessed, but electrotransformation frequencies depended on both the strain and the nature of transforming DNA. In general, small rolling circle (RC) plasmids could be electroporated at high frequency into a wide range of strains with efficiencies of 10(2)-10(5) transformants microgram-1 of transforming DNA. The presence of these plasmids did not influence doubling times during growth in broth, and they were generally extremely stable in slow milk acidifying strains, with 85-100% of transformants retaining the selective markers over 105 generations. Vectors were less stable in fast-growing cultures. Of the three theta-type plasmids assessed, only one, pIL253, could be electroporated at low frequency into some slow growing strains. The presence of this plasmid caused a 40% increase in doubling time and it was lost from cells at a rate of 3% per generation. Attempts to alter the proteolytic status of slow acidifying strains of <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus by the introduction of heterologous proteinase genes are also described.",M1
9721662,"Preliminary characterization of microflora of Comté cheese.The evolution of the microflora of three Comté cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. The same starter was used with each type of milk. The comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. Starter lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. Other microorganisms, i.e. homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (Lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, Lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. The characterization of <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. The values for the genome size of 11 Strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 Mbp.

9721653,"Random amplified polymorphic DNA and amplified ribosomal DNA spacer polymorphism: powerful methods to differentiate Streptococcus thermophilus strains.Streptococci from different collections and dairy materials were characterized by conventional and molecular methods. After amplification of the 16S-23S rDNA spacer region, all the strains referable to the genus Streptococcus exhibited a single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product, allowing their differentiation from enterococci. Cleaving this PCR product with Hae III, two different restriction patterns could be observed, allowing Streptococcus salivarius DSM 20560T, <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus NCDO 822 and two strains of Streptococcus spp. to be gathered in one group and all the other strains in another. In order to achieve strain typing, all the cultures were investigated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis employing two selected primers. The results were treated by cluster analysis, appearing significantly consistent with both the taxonomic position and the origin of the strains. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of Sma I digests of the genomic DNA from 11 representative strains with decreasing levels of RAPD similarity allowed their diversity to be confirmed, even though RAPD-PCR proved to be less discriminating than PFGE analysis. The results are discussed with reference to the capability of the analytical procedures used to aid both identification and strain typing of streptococci, as well as the taxonomic structure of the species Strep. thermophilus.",M1

All strains produced a polymer composed of the neutral sugars glucose and galactose, but in different ratios. It was clearly shown that the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides from Strep. thermophilus LY03 is growth-associated and hence displays primary metabolite kinetics. The monomer ratio of the exopolysaccharide synthesized did not vary throughout the fermentation cycle. The production kinetics and exopolysaccharide yields were strongly dependent on the fermentation conditions. Physical factors such as temperature, pH and oxygen tension as well as chemical factors (medium composition, initial lactose concentration, carbon/nitrogen levels) were of utmost importance.",M1
9602288,"Binding properties of streptococcal glucosyltransferases for hydroxyapatite, saliva-coated hydroxyapatite, and bacterial surfaces.The binding specificities of Streptococcus glucosyltransferase (Gtf) B, C and D for hydroxyapatite (HA), saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (SHA), and bacterial surfaces were examined. For HA beads the following values were obtained: (K = affinity; N = number of binding sites) GtfB, K = 46 x 10(5) ml/mumol, N = 0.65 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; GtfC, K = 86 x 10(5) ml/mumol, N = 4.42 x 10(-6) mumol/m2.; GtfD, K = 100 x 10(5) ml/mumol, N = 0.83 x 10(-6) mumol/m2. For SHA beads, the following values were obtained: GtfB, K = 14.7 x 10(5) ml/mumol, N = 1.03 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; GtfC, K = 21.3 x 10(5) ml/mumol, N = 3.66 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; GtfD, K = 1.73 x 10(5) ml/mumol, N = 8.88 x 10(-6) mumol/m2. The binding of GtfB to SHA beads was reduced in the presence of parotid saliva, but the binding of GtfC and D was unaffected. The binding of GtfB to SHA in the presence of parotid saliva supplemented with GtfC and D was reduced when compared with its binding to SHA in the presence of parotid saliva alone. In contrast, te binding of GtfC and SHA was unaffected when parotid saliva was supplemented with the other Gtf enzymes. GtfB bound to several bacterial strains (<e>Strep</e>, mutans GS-5, Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E and Lactobacillus casei 4646) in an active form, while GtfC and D did not bind to bacterial surfaces. It is concluded that of the three Gtf enzymes, GtfC has the highest affinity for HA and SHA surfaces and can adsorb on the the SHA surface in the presence of the other two enzymes. GtfD also binds to SHA in the presence of the other enzymes but has a very low affinity for the surface. GtfB does not bind to SHA in the presence of the other Gtf enzymes but binds avidly to bacterial surfaces in an active form. Therefore, GtfC most probably binds to apatitic surfaces, while GtfB binds to bacterial surfaces.",M1
9584907,"Intra-individual variations of salivary microbial levels in young adults.The variations of salivary levels of total viable flora, oral streptococci, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus and Candida in twenty-three subjects, over a 6-month period, trying to control many potential sources of variability, were investigated. Most subjects showed log count variations of the microbial parameters larger than 1. They were 95.6% (total flora), 91.2% (oral streptococci), 73.9% (lactobacilli), 60.8% (<e>Strep</e>. mutans) and 30.3% (Candida). The intra-individual fluctuations were larger than the fluctuations of the means of the counts between samples. This suggests that the shifts in levels of these micro-organisms were more frequent intra-individually than at a population level. Strep. mutans levels significantly explained Streptococcus-Oral (inverse correlation), Lactobacillus and Candida variability. The reported variations were due to technical and biological factors and suggest that, in order to assess the salivary level of some microbial parameters in an individual, the mean count and the range of counts, obtained by more than two samples taken under the same conditions, should be considered.",M1

Streptococcus dysgalactiae adheres to epithelial cells from the bovine mammary gland and to extracellular matrix proteins in vitro and invades mammary epithelial cell cultures, all of which can be potentially important pathogenic mechanisms. In this study, mechanisms involved in the invasion of <e>Strep</e>. dysgalactiae into epithelial cells from the bovine mammary gland were characterized. Studies were conducted to determine whether Strep. dysgalactiae invaded mammary epithelial cell cultures in a dose-dependent manner and whether mammary epithelial cells that harbored different numbers of Strep. dysgalactiae for varying times were damaged. Bacterial invasion increased as inoculum size increased; however, the number of intracellular bacteria was not proportional to the inoculum size, increased; however, the number of intracellular bacteria was not proportional to the inoculum size, indicating that a finite number of organisms is capable of invading epithelial cells. No net increase in intracellular organisms was detected at any bacterial density evaluated; however, Strep. dysgalactiae remained viable throughout the evaluation. In addition, Strep. dysgalactiae did not appear to cause cell injury at any bacterial density or time point evaluated. These data suggest that Strep. dysgalactiae can survive within mammary epithelial cells for an extended time without losing viability or damaging the eukaryotic cell. This feature may be associated with the development of persistent infection and protection of organisms from antimicrobial drugs and host defense mechanisms and may provide a route for bacterial colonization of subepithelial tissues.",M1
9403113,"Investigation of calcium-binding sites on the surfaces of selected gram-positive oral organisms.Dental plaque is rich in anionic groups with a high calcium-binding capacity which may affect mineral dynamics at the tooth surface. The two major calcium-binding sites on Gram-positive cell surfaces are carboxylate groups (in proteins and peptidoglycan cross-links) and phosphate groups (in lipoteichoic and teichoic acid). Equilibrium dialysis was used to measure calcium-binding capacities of whole cells and purified cell-wall material (CWM) from Streptococcus mutans R9, <e>Strep</e>. oralis EF186, Strep. gordonii NCTC 7865, Strep. downei NCTC 11391, Actinomyces naeslundii WVU627 and Lactobacillus casei AC413. This material was stripped of phosphate (PS-CWM) and treated to mask carboxylate groups (CM-CWM). Whole-cell calcium-binding capacities ranged from 240 (Strep. downei) to 50 (L. casei) mu mol/g (dry wt). Differences in CWM, PS-CWM and CM-CWM calcium-binding capacities demonstrated the greater importance of phosphate in comparison with carboxylate groups in cell calcium binding. These data indicate that, in streptococci, calcium binding is predominantly phosphate group-based, especially in the teichoic acid-containing Strep. oralis. In the other species tested, calcium binding is predominantly carboxylate group-based.",M1
9361234,"Bovine mastitis pathogens in New York and Pennsylvania: prevalence and effects on somatic cell count and milk production.Milk samples were collected from 108,312 dairy cows during 1601 farm visits made between January 1991 and June 1995. The herd visits were made by personnel from the Central Laboratory of the Quality Milk Promotion Services at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) to farms located in central New York and northern Pennsylvania. Dairy Herd Improvement Association records were available for 32,978 cows in 327 herds. Intramammary infections, as defined by positive milk cultures, were present in 48.5% of all cows and in 36.3% of cows in herds enrolled in the Dairy Herd Improvement Association. Over 75% of the intramammary infections were caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus spp. other than <e>Strep</e>. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Mean days in milk at the time of diagnosis, linear score of the somatic cell count, cost of milk loss per lactation, and milk production effects were calculated for 24 etiologic agents of bovine mastitis.",M1
9347116,"Adherence of oral streptococci to an immobilized antimicrobial agent.An antimicrobial agent, 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride, was immobilized on silica. Interaction between the material (termed) OAIS) and various oral bacterial species were then studied. Seven species of Streptococcus and two Actinomyces were investigated for their ability to adhere to this biomaterial. Cell-surface hydrophobicity and zeta-potential were examined as well. Analysis of extracted hydrophobic proteins which adhered to OAIS revealed that the adherence of these micro-organisms was closely related to the hydrophobicity of their cell surfaces. The results of zeta-potential assays indicated that negative charge on the cell surface inhibited adherence to OAIS. Gel electrophoresis revealed that OAIS could absorb cell-surface hydrophobic proteins from all bacterial species tested. Preadsorption of hydrophobic components on the cell surface inhibited adherence of the <e>Strep</e>. mutans strain to OAIS in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicate that OAIS adsorption of these oral bacteria was dependent on the degree of hydrophobicity of their surfaces. A major component of this adherence was hydrophobic cell-surface proteins.",M1
9202436,"Presence of additional peptidases in Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ 302 compared to Lactococcus lactis.Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used in the dairy industry but little is known about its peptidase system. The aim of this study was to determine the biochemical and genetic characteristics of this system, and to compare it to the well known system of Lactococcus lactis. We separated the intracellular proteins of <e>Strep</e>. thermophilus CNRZ 302 and L. lactis NCDO 763 by ion-exchange chromatography and we detected the activity of the different types of peptidases. In both L. lactis and Strep. thermophilus strains, we showed 13 different peptidase activities with biochemical homologies between both species. Streptococcus thermophilus also possessed two peptidases which we did not find in L. lactis: an aminopeptidase and an oligopeptidase. We performed Southern blot experiments and among the eight peptidase genes tested, only the genes encoding the general aminopeptidases, pepC and pepN, were homologous between the L. lactis and Strep. thermophilus strains. Besides biochemical and genetic similarities, the peptidase systems of Strep. thermophilus and L. lactis thus differed by the presence of additional peptidases in Strep. thermophilus.",M1
9098796,"Identification of Streptococcus species by randomly amplified polymorphic deoxyribonucleic acid fingerprinting.Identification of Streptococcus species isolated from bovine milk by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting was evaluated. Bacterial DNA templates were prepared using a standardized method for randomly amplified polymorphic DNA amplification and previously evaluated arbitrary primers. Amplified DNA fragments were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and were analyzed by densitometry. Unidentified streptococci (n = 163) that were isolated from mammary secretions of dairy cows were evaluated. The DNA fingerprint patterns of unidentified bacteria were compared using a computerized database that contained DNA fingerprint patterns of test strains. Comparison with the API 20 <e>Strep</e> identification system (bioMérieux Vitek, Inc., Hazelwood, MO) and conventional biochemical tests showed that about 91% of isolates (148 of 163) were identified correctly by DNA fingerprinting. The sensitivity of the DNA fingerprinting technique was 90%, and the specificity was 92%. However, the DNA fingerprinting technique only identified 4 of the 11 species included in the study. Three of the 4 species, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae, represent the streptococci isolated most frequently from cows with mastitis. The other Streptococcus and Enterococcus species that were not identified by the DNA fingerprinting system are less frequently isolated as causative agents of mastitis. Expanding the DNA fingerprint database would likely increase the sensitivity and specificity of this technique.",M1
9134122,"Variations in the predominant cultivable microflora of dental plaque at defined subsites on approximal tooth surfaces in children.The distribution and composition of the resident microflora were determined in approximal gingival margin plaque from 21 premolars extracted from schoolchildren (mean age 12.0 +/- 1.8 yr). Indigo carmine (5% w v) was used to visualize plaque to facilitate sampling. About 1 mm2 of plaque was removed from sites away from (A), to the side of (S), and below (B) the contact area. Plaque samples were dispersed, serially diluted, and cultured on selective and non-selective agar media. An average of seven to nine species was found at each subsite. Streptococcus and Actinomyces were subdivided on the basis of a range of biochemical tests. The predominant Actinomyces and streptococcal species at most subsites were A. naeslundii and <e>Strep</e>. mitis biovar I. A. naeslundii and A. odontolyticus were isolated more often at subsite B (90.5 and 57.1%, respectively), and A. israelii at subsite S (66.7%) Strep. mitis 1 and Strep. sanguis were found more frequently at subsite S (76.2 and 66.7% respectively), whereas Strep mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Strep. gordonii and Veillonella spp. were recovered most commonly from subsite B (85.7, 33.3, 38.1 and 76.2%, respectively). The isolation frequencies of Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus were significantly higher at subsite B (A B p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Veillonella spp. were significantly higher at subsites B and S (A &lt; B, p &gt; 0.01; B &gt; S, p &lt; 0.05), while Neisseria spp. were most common at subsite A (A &gt; B. p &gt; 0.03). IgAl protease-producing species were found at each subsite, but they formed only a small proportion of the total Streptococcus population. This study has shown that local variations were evident at different subsites, both with respect to species prevalence and to proportions of each species within each subsite. The population shifts in gingival margin plaque appear to relate to the location of plaque in relation to the most caries-prone site below the contact area B.",M1
9101752,"[Evaluation of a rapid method for the identification of the Enterococcus genus]BACKGROUND: The evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in NaCl esculin broth and group D antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the Enterococcus genus were performed. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 E. faecium, 3 E. avium, 16 Streptococcus intermedius, 7 S. salivarius, 4 S. bovis, 4 S. constellatus, 2 S. sanguis and 1 strain of S. equinus, S. mitis, S. uberis and S. mutans were studied. The tests used were: rapid test in NaCl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup D streptococcus agglutination (Patho Dx <e>Strep</e> D/PYR; Diagnostic Product Corporation). All catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the Enterococcus genus. The usefulness of Gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. RESULTS: The results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. No significant differences were observed between the results obtained with Gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the Streptococcus mutans strain. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group D agglutination and rapid test in NaCl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the Enterococcus genus.",M1
9058273,"Comparison of success of antibiotic therapy during lactation and results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bovine mastitis.Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted on a variety of mastitis pathogens. The infected quarters were subsequently treated during lactation with a commercially available product containing penicillin and novobiocin that was designed for lactating cows. Cows were treated as per the recommendations of the product manufacturer, and cures were determined by the absence of bacteria in both sets of duplicate quarter milk samples that were collected at 28 d posttreatment. Comparisons were made between the susceptibility of the bacteria and the therapeutic success or failure. All isolates tested were considered to be susceptible to the penicillin and novobiocin combination. Bacteriologic cure rates for newly acquired Staphylococcus aureus intramammary infection (IMI) (&lt; 2 wk in duration) at 28 d posttreatment were 70%. Cure rates for chronic Staph. aureus IMI (&gt; 4 wk duration) were much lower (35%), reaffirming previous reports of the intractable nature of chronic Staph. aureus IMI. Cure rates for subclinical IMI caused by other organisms were 90% for Streptococcus agalactiae, 91% for Streptococcus uberis, 90% for Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 77% for other Streptococcus spp., and 71% for Staphylococcus spp. other than Staph. aureus. In vitro testing was considered to be a predictor of therapy outcome for IMI caused by Staphylococcus spp., newly acquired Staph. aureus, <e>Strep</e>. uberis, Strep. dysgalactiae, and Strep. agalactiae, but was not considered to be a useful predictor of efficacy for chronic IMI caused by Staph. aureus.",M1
9058272,"Prevalence and duration of intramammary infection in Danish heifers during the peripartum period.Milk samples were collected from 180 heifers from 20 herds around parturition to study the prevalence and persistence of intramammary infection (IMI). A total of 3382 quarter milk samples was collected each week from 4 wk before parturition to 4 wk after parturition. Staphylococcus chromogenes, the most commonly found bacterial species before parturition, was isolated from 15% of all quarters. However, IMI with Staph. chromogenes decreased shortly after parturition to around 1% of quarters. Infectious with Staphylococcus simulans and Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in 1 to 3% of quarters both before and after parturition. Infections with Staph. simulans persisted in the same quarter for several weeks, but IMI with Staph. epidermidis were transient. Streptococcus dysgalactiae was isolated from 4 to 6% of quarters before and immediately after parturition, but the prevalence of IMI with <e>Strep</e>. dysgalactiae decreased. A strong association existed between IMI with Strep. dysgalactiae before parturition and IMI with Strep. dysgalactiae after parturition, and, using DNA typing, the persistence of 9 IMI was confirmed. Infections with Staphylococcus aureus rarely occurred before parturition, but the rate of IMI with Staph. aureus greatly increased during the 1st wk after parturition. No association was found between bacterial status before parturition and IMI with Staph. aureus after parturition. Overall, the presence of bacterial IMI in a quarter before parturition increased the risk of IMI for the lactating cow. This study demonstrated that variability in prevalence and duration of IMI according to bacterial species occurred around first parturition.",M1
8958257,"Comparison of five methods for the determination of arginine hydrolysis by viridans streptococci.Seventy-eight clinical isolates and four control strains of viridans streptococci were tested in parallel for arginine hydrolysis by five different methods. These comprised two commercial systems, the API20 <e>STREP</e> and Vitek GPI card, two published methods, one based on ammonia production and one on alkalisation of Møeller's decarboxylase medium, and a method based on alkalisation of a phenol-red broth medium dispensed into microtitration plates. The clinical isolates were speciated by their biochemical reactions in the API20 STREP and API20 ZYM systems. One strain produced only a weak reaction for arginine hydrolysis in the medium by ammonia production, but otherwise the results with this medium, the API20 STREP and the microtitration plate method were identical. Tests with the Møeller decarboxylase medium and Vitek GPI card gave negative results with isolates that were positive by other methods. Inoculum size was shown to influence arginine hydrolysis obtained with Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 7863 and S. milleri 10713.",M1
9019209,"[Acute bacterial meningitis in adults: a clinical and developmental analysis of 100 cases]BACKGROUND: Characterize clinical findings and outcome of acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) in adults, with special emphasis on nosocomial meningitis and meningitis in the elderly. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all persons 14 years of age or older in whom ABM was diagnosed in our hospital during a 12 and a half-year period. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were treated for 100 episodes of ABM, of which 23 percent were nosocomial and 27 percent occurred in elderly persons. Predisposing factors were present in 59 percent of the episodes. Fifty-four percent had the classic triad of fever, nuchal rigidity, and change in mental status. Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis with a neutrophilic predominance, hypoglycorrhachia, and elevated protein levels were present in 62 percent of the episodes. A pathogen was identified in 62 percent of the cases, in a higher frequency in elderly persons (p &lt; 0.05) and in patients who had not received antibiotics before the lumbar puncture (p &lt; 0.05). Causal agents more frequently identified were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (27 percent) in community-acquired meningitis, coagulase-negative Staphylococci (35 percent) in nosocomial meningitis, and <e>Strep</e>. pneumoniae (33 percent) in elderly persons. Central nervous system (CNS) complications occurred in 18 percent of episodes, and 15 percent developed systemic complications. The overall mortality rate was 9 percent, higher among patients in whom CNS complications began within 24 hours of admission (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of cases of ABM in adults are nosocomial, or affect elderly persons. The fatality rate is high, particularly among those who develop CNS complications at the onset of the disease.",M1
8900055,"Isolation and properties of bacteriolytic enzyme-producing cocci from the human mouth.One-hundred-and-one bacteriolytic enzyme producing organisms were isolated from various sites of the mouth. All were non-hemolytic, Gram-positive, and chain-forming cocci. Ninety-one strains, like the reference strains of Streptococcus defectivus and S. adjacens, were dependent on pyridoxal for growth and produced a chromophore. The Rapid ID32 <e>STREP</e> system speciated these isolates as S. defectivus, S. adjacens or Gemella morbillorum. The remaining 10 bacteriolytic isolates were pyridoxal-independent and 8 belonged to S. intermediate. Some pyridoxal-independent S. intermedius reference strains including ATCC27335T and all group D Enterococcus strains tested were also bacteriolytic. Thus, bacteriolytic enzyme production is common to nutritionally variant streptococci but not unique to S. defectives and S. adjacens. The nutritionally variant strains generally had arylamidases but not alkaline phosphatase. The S. defectivus strains produced alpha-and beta-galactosidases (biotype 1) whereas the S. adjacens strains generally produced N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and some had beta-glucuronidase but others did not (biotypes 2 and 3). The C. morbillorum strains had no detectable activity of these glycosidases (biotype 4) but produced a chromophore and an arginine dihydrolase, exhibiting a physiological profile atypical of the Gemella species. This indicates the possible presence of an additional phenotypic group or a new species among the nutritionally variant streptococci.",M1
8850584,"Human root caries: microbiota of a limited number of root caries lesions.The microbiota of root caries lesions of different grades of severity were studied. Fourteen lesions were examined. The experimental design of the study allowed correlation of histopathologically distinguishable stages with specific and distinct microbial populations. Dentin samples were ground in a sterile mortar and cultured anaerobically on nonselective Columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 5% hemolyzed human blood and on media selective for Lactobacillus spp. and streptococci. The cultivable microbiota were quantitatively speciated using Rapid ID 32A, Rapid ID 32 <e>Strep</e>, API 20 Strep, APIZYM, and API50 CH tests and SDS-PAG electrophoresis. In initial as well as in advanced lesions gram-positive bacteria accounted for approximately 90% of the CFUt. The proportion of Actinomyces, and in particular A. naeslundii was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in initial lesions than in advanced lesions. In contrast, the percentage of Streptococcus and especially S. mutans was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in advanced than in initial lesions. Surprisingly low (0.8% of the CFUt) was the percentage of lactobacilli in advanced lesions. Gram-negative bacteria formed a minor part of the microbiota in both initial and advanced lesions. Among the gram-negative isolates, Prevotella, Selenomonas, and Bacteroides spp. were most noticeable. In advanced lesions, only the outermost layer of 0.5 mm thickness was populated by a high number of bacteria; the following segments harbored a negligible number of bacteria only. It is concluded that root caries is a continuous destruction process which is restricted to a subsurface zone of limited depth. The necrotic dentin is successively worn away, leading to a saucer-shaped cavitation which is repopulated by plaque. The creation of cavitations favors an aciduric flora. This might explain the succession of bacterial populations observed during the destruction process.",M1
8737781,"The nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in children with otitis media with effusion.A study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence of nasopharyngeal alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against pathogens, as a defense mechanism of the normal bacterial flora against infection. Cultures were taken from the nasopharynges of 43 children with otitis media with effusion (OME). The detection rates of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococus aureus and group A streptococci were significantly lower in the nasopharynx than those isolated from the tonsils of the same patients. Moreover, the detection rates of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against all of these pathogens derived from the nasopharynx were lower than those in healthy children, streptococcal strains with activity against H. influenzae and <e>Strep</e>, pneumoniae were also lower than that in patients with tonsillitis. These findings suggest that low nasopharyngeal levels of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against respiratory pathogens may render children susceptible to OME. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationships between the prevalence of pathogens in the nasopharynx and the inhibitory activities of alpha-streptococci against them in order to devise and select optimal treatment for patients with OME.",M1
7487577,"Bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.Earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. The absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. To identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. Peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mM) for 4 h and with the pH kept at 7.0 by a pH-stat. Removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or 294.4 mM [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. Hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, Streptococcus sanguis I and II (sanguis and oralis), and <e>Strep</e>. mitior (mitis biotype I); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mM were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mM when grown anaerobically. Earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. The amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. None of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, Neisseria sicca, Haemophilus segnis, H. parainfluenzae, Actinomyces viscosus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. The ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mM. This almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mM. In the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M1

Uncommon serovars (serotypes) KTH-1 (= ATCC 49298), KTH-2 (= ATCC 49296), KTH-3 (= ATCC KTH-4 (= ATCC 49297) and B220 (serovar KTH-1) with both IgA1 protease and neuraminidase (sialidase) were identified as Strep. oralis, whereas common serovars ST3 with IgA1 protease alone and ST7 without both enzymes were identified as Strep. sanguis and Strep. gordonii, respectively. Isolates previously ranked as uncommon serovars were identified as Strep. oralis, whereas the rest ranked as common serovars were identified as the same species as those of the grouping strains. A soft-agar technique was available for species identification except for Strep. oralis serovar KTH-1 reacting with the antiserum against Strep. gordonii ST7. The frequency of isolation of Strep. oralis was higher in Behçet's disease (52%) than in controls (38%), but no difference was observed between the properties of the two groups of isolates.

7639641,"Calcium and water diffusion in single-species model bacterial plaques.The diffusion of tritiated water and 45Ca through single-species model plaques was measured in a diaphragm cell. Using plaques of Streptococcus downei, the apparent diffusion coefficient for tritiated water showed a small but significant decrease between pH 7.0 and 5.0 with a smaller, non-significant decrease for calcium. These effects are attributed to possible plaque shrinkage at reduced pH, which overcomes effects due to charge-dependent changes in permeability. Effective diffusion coefficients for 45Ca obtained from lag-time measurements were much reduced at low carrier concentrations, demonstrating a binding which correlated with previous results from equilibrium dialysis. <e>Strep</e>. sanguis and Corynebacterium matruchotii showed few differences from Strep. downei, although the corynebacterium previously demonstrated stronger calcium binding. Permeability to water and calcium were slightly affected by pH, while effective diffusion of calcium depended on concentration.

Species within each group produced unique patterns of activity. The most commonly produced glycosidases were beta-D-glucosidase, beta-D-galactosidase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminidase and the least commonly produced glycosidase activity was beta-fucosidase with Streptococcus intermedius (SMG) being the only species capable of producing the activity. For arylamidase activity, the most commonly produced type was lysine-arylamidase. Glycosidase and arylamidase activities were localized to particular sub-cellular fractions. alpha-galactosidase was found only in culture supernatant fluids whereas N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase was found in all fractions; the culture supernatant, cell wall, cell membrane and cytoplasm. No arylamidase activity was seen in culture supernatants. Phe-arg-arylamidase was found only in cytoplasmic fractions whereas val-pro-argarylamidase was found in cell walls, cell membranes and cytoplasmic fraction. Protease activity was measured as the degradation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and casein. Casein was degraded by a number of strains whereas no species/strains were able to degrade BSA. Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus (SMG), Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus defectivus (SSG) were the only species that produced hyaluronidase and no species produced chondroitin sulphatase.

7828861,"Use of the tetracycline promoter for the tightly regulated production of a murine antibody fragment in Escherichia coli.A generic vector, pASK75, was developed for the synthesis of foreign proteins in Escherichia coli under transcriptional control of the tetA promoter/operator. Tight regulation was achieved by placing the structural gene for the tet repressor, as a transcriptional fusion, downstream from the beta-lactamase-encoding gene (bla) on the same plasmid. Strong expression of the foreign gene was conveniently induced by adding anhydrotetracycline at a low concentration. Using the production of a recombinant murine immunoglobulin F(ab) fragment as an example, the system was shown to function independently of the host-strain background and to be extremely well repressed in the absence of the inducer. Thus, it represents an economic and independent alternative to IPTG-inducible promoter constructs.

It catalysed the hydrolysis of a range of aminoacyl 4-nitroanilides and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin derivatives, dipeptides, tripeptides and oligopeptides. In common with aminopeptidases from other lactic acid bacteria, the enzyme from <e>Strep</e>. salivarius subsp. thermophilus showed highest activity with lysyl derivatives but was also very active with arginyl and leucyl derivatives. Relative activity with alanyl, phenylalanyl, tyrosyl, seryl and valyl derivatives was considerably lower and with glycyl, glutamyl and prolyl derivatives almost negligible. The aminopeptidase also catalysed the hydrolysis of dipeptides and tripeptides but mostly at rates much less than that with L-lysyl-4-nitroanilide and oligopeptides. The enzyme catalysed the successive hydrolysis of various amino acid residues from the N-terminus of several oligopeptides but it was unable to cleave peptide bonds on the N-terminal side of a proline residue.",M1
7945017,"An in vitro investigation of the cariogenic potential of oral streptococci.Whilst the importance of the mutans streptococci in the aetiology of dental caries is clear, a number of studies have described caries development in their absence. This investigation aimed to assess the cariogenic potential of Streptococcus gordonii, <e>Strep</e>. sanguis, Strep. vestibularis and Enterococcus faecalis in comparison with Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus, using a recently described in vitro model. In the presence of a 146 mM sucrose solution and powdered hydroxyapatite, each species was incubated for 5 h, after which acid anion production, calcium release and change in pH were measured. It was possible to assign each species to one of three groups, with E. faecalis, Strep. gordonii, Strep. sanguis exhibiting low, Strep. vestibularis intermediate, and Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus high in vitro cariogenic potential. This assay could be used as a screening test to assess the potential cariogenicity of a range of bacterial species.",M1
7928781,"Identification and composition of the streptococcal and enterococcal flora of tonsils, intestines and faeces of pigs.Streptococcus suis was the most frequent Streptococcus spp. in pig tonsils, followed by the beta-haemolytic porcine 'equisimilis' ecovar of <e>Strep</e>. dysgalactiae. The intestinal streptococcal flora was composed of Strep. bovis, Strep. hyointestinalis and Strep. suis. Many of these intestinal Strep. suis belonged to a beta-glucuronidase-negative biotype which is infrequent in lesions. Nearly half of the strains presumptively identified as Strep. alactolyticus produced acid from lactose. This species was not found in tonsils and intestines but was about equally prevalent as Strep. hyointestinalis in pig faeces and rectal swabs. Other streptococci were rare in this material. Enterococci were much less frequently identified than streptococci in tonsils and faeces. In intestinal samples Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Ent. hirae and Ent. cecorum were most frequently found. In faeces Ent. faecium was the most prevalent enterococcus. The characteristics of the less well known species Strep. alactolyticus and Strep. hyointestinalis are described in detail, and guidelines for their differentiation from Strep. bovis and Strep. suis given.",M1
7841829,"Rapid differentiation of Streptococcus milleri from other beta-haemolytic group A, C, and G streptococci by simple screening tests.Eighty five beta-haemolytic Lancefield group A(23), C(22), and G(40) streptococci were tested for sulphonamide sensitivity, ability to degrade beta-D glucuronide (groups C and G) and bacitracin sensitivity (group A). Identification of isolates was initially confirmed by the API 20 <e>STREP</e> system. Zones of beta-haemolysis were too variable for correct Streptococcus milleri identification in 10% of cases. However, only group C and G S. milleri were both sulphonamide-resistant and beta-D glucuronide-negative. Two group A S. milleri strains could have been mis-identified as Streptococcus pyogenes if combined sulphonamide and bacitracin resistance had not been noted. In a busy diagnostic laboratory, screening of beta-haemolytic group A, C, and G streptococci for sulphonamide sensitivity is recommended. Sulphonamide-resistant group A S. pyogenes can be distinguished from S. milleri by bacitracin sensitivity. S. milleri can be rapidly and cheaply differentiated from other sulphonamide-resistant group C and G streptococci by a simple 4 h commercial beta-D glucuronide assay.",M1
8185499,"Inhibition of hydroxyapatite crystal growth by lipoteichoic acid.Lipoteichoic acids were purified from freshly isolated strains of Streptococcus sanguis and Lactobacillus casei, and from a laboratory strain of <e>Strep</e>. rattus BHT. Their effects on the seeded growth of hydroxyapatite in 1 mM CaCl2, 7.5 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) were determined. At lipoteichoic acid concentrations of 25 microM organic phosphate (Po) and higher, the growth of hydroxyapatite appeared to be inhibited, at 100 microM Po inhibition was complete for several hours. In contrast, low concentrations of lipoteichoic acids (5-10 microM Po) may have a stimulatory effect on the seeded growth of hydroxyapatite. It was concluded that lipoteichoic acid may be one of the bacterial products that inhibit enamel lesion repair in vivo.",M1
8297255,"Grouping of oral streptococcal species using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy in comparison with classical microbiological identification.The grouping and identification made by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of 40 oral streptococcal strains was compared with their known taxonomic positions. Grouping was obtained by cluster analysis on the spectral distances between the first derivative spectra of the strains. Spectra were divided into five spectral 'windows' and cluster analysis was either on either a combination of all five windows or on a selected window. The oral streptococci were divided into two main clusters, mutans streptococci and other streptococci. This division was based mainly on the spectral information contained in the window between 1300-900 cm-1, indicative of polysaccharide and phosphate-carrying compounds. In the grouping based on the entire spectrum, species clusters could be observed for Streptococcus crista, <e>Strep</e>. salivarius and Strep. rattus. A few strains were placed in wrong clusters because of intra-strain variance. It is concluded that the grouping of these oral streptococcal species was good and similar to the classical taxonomy and that FT-IR might develop into a new identification method for oral streptococci.",M1
8246252,"Biologically active extracellular products of oral viridans streptococci and the aetiology of Kawasaki disease.A bacteriological study of isolates from the oral cavity of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD), age-matched non-KD patients and healthy children, showed that over half the KD and control isolates had gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci. About 50% of these organisms were identified as viridans streptococci by means of an API <e>Strep</e> 20 kit. Further identification by fluorometric DNA-DNA hybridisation demonstrated that the predominant species were S. oralis and S. mitis, each of which accounted for 25% of the isolates of viridans streptococci; 40% of viridans strains were unidentifiable; and S. sanguis and S. parasanguis were minor components. Studies in vivo showed that insertion of culture supernates of most of the viridans streptococci increased capillary permeability and induced redness with swelling and occasional bleeding in rabbit skin. One-third of S. mitis strains and one-fifth of the unidentified strains caused aggregation of human blood platelets, whereas S. oralis and other strains had no such effect. The distribution of extracellular lipoteichoic acids and glucan produced in the presence of sucrose was also examined. There were no significant differences in the recovery rate of viridans streptococci forming these biologically active extracellular products between KD and control groups.",M1

8343073,"Urease activity in Streptococcus salivarius at low pH.Arginine metabolism to alkali by the arginine deiminase system in oral bacteria increases their acid tolerance. The potential of urease activity in Streptococcus salivarius to fulfil a similar role was examined. In cell extracts between pH 5.0 and 8.0, urease activity was over 80% the maximal rate. The urease rate was zero at pH 4.3, and at pH 3.6 the enzyme was rapidly inactivated (t 1/2 of 0.6 min). The pH range of intact cells was broader. In <e>Strep</e>. salivarius cells acidified to pH 2.6 for 5 min, urease was completely retained and the ureolytic pH rise was rapid. There was no urease activity after acidification to pH 2. In cells acidified to maintain the pH between 3.3 and 4, viability was maintained for a short period (extrapolation indicated 20 min) and then decreased. This acidification induced alkali generation or acid removal that decreased in parallel to loss of viability. A small fraction (10%) of the urease was rapidly inactivated, after which both the remaining urease and pH response decreased at a similar rate to cell viability (t 1/2 of 15-20 min), but for at least 1 h following acidification, a rapid ureolysis induced rise in pH to above 7. In cells held at pH 3.6 and treated to compromise their membranes by freeze-thawing or transient acidification to pH 2.3, 70-80% of the urease was lost rapidly and the remainder inactivated at a rate similar to that in intact cells. Therefore, although at pH below 4, S. salivarius urease is outside its pH activity range and the free enzyme is rapidly inactivated, intact cells the urease is protected and ureolytic generation of ammonia is capable of substantially raising the pH for at least 1 h while the cell population is being progressively killed by acid.",M1
8392324,"Longitudinal study of relations between human salivary antimicrobial proteins and measures of dental plaque accumulation and composition.Many studies have attempted to relate levels of antimicrobial proteins in saliva to oral health; results have been inconsistent, and one reason might be inconsistency of measures of plaque and saliva within subjects. This study investigated associations between plaque and salivary variables in longitudinal data. Whole saliva, and 8-h plaque pooled from buccal first permanent molars, was obtained from 32 dental students on Tuesdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. over 4 weeks. Salivary flow rate was determined, and samples were assayed for lysozyme, lactoferrin, total peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, OSCN-, sIgA and total protein. Colonies on mitis-salivarius agar were assigned to Streptococcus sanguis, <e>Strep</e>. mutans or Strep. salivarius on the basis of morphology, supplemented by the API Rapid Strep identification system. Consistency of values within subjects across weeks was evaluated by repeat-measures analysis of variance and intraclass correlation; data were transformed to reduce skewness. Pearson's r was used to determine associations between plaque and salivary variables. Significant intraclass correlations (alpha = 0.05) were found for all salivary variables except myeloperoxidase, and for total flora, total streptococci, Strep. sanguis and Strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci. Significant Pearson correlations with Strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci were found for total protein (r = -0.24), sIgA (r = -0.22), lactoferrin (r = -0.19) and OSCN- (r = 0.20) when data from all weeks were pooled (n = 128). Strep. sanguis proportions tended to be low in subjects with high values for salivary proteins; the range of proportions was wider in subjects with low salivary values. These findings suggest some consistency of weekly values for many plaque and salivary variables. They also support previous cross-sectional data which suggested that salivary antimicrobial proteins may have some effect on plaque composition. This study was made before recent revisions in streptococcal taxonomy, and further research is needed to clarify interactions of salivary proteins with currently defined species.",M1

The tests performed included Lancefield grouping; tests for hemolysis; tests for the production of hyaluronidase, chondroitin sulfatase, DNase, proteases, and hydrogen peroxide; and PCR for the detection of the intermedilysin gene (ily). We also generated biochemical profiles with the Rapid ID <e>Strep</e> 32 API system and tested cell-free supernatants for the presence of the signal molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2) using a Vibrio harveyi bioassay with a subset of CF strains. The S. intermedius isolates from both strain collections were similar, while the S. constellatus and S. anginosus isolates yielded several biotypes that differed in prevalence between the two strain collections. Beta-hemolytic, Lancefield group C S. constellatus comprised 74.4% of the S. constellatus isolates from patients with CF but only 13.3% of the corresponding isolates from patients with invasive infections. This was the only S. constellatus biotype associated with pulmonary exacerbations. Hyaluronidase-positive S. anginosus was detected only among the isolates from patients with CF. Strain-to-strain variability in AI-2 expression was evident, with the mean values being the highest for S. anginosus, followed by S. constellatus and then S. intermedius. Cluster analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the species of SMG could be accurately determined with a minimum of three phenotypic tests: tests for the Lancefield group, hyaluronidase production, and chondroitin sulfatase production. Furthermore, isolates from patients with invasive infections clustered with isolates from the sputum of patients with CF, suggesting that the respiratory tract isolates were equally pathogenic.",M2

19786423,"Development of a patient-reported outcome measure for children with streptococcal pharyngitis.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a patient-reported outcome measure (<e>Strep</e>-PRO) for assessing symptoms of group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis from the child's point of view and to present preliminary data on its internal reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness. METHODS: We selected 8 symptoms for inclusion in the Strep-PRO. We used the Strep-PRO to assess improvement in children who were aged 5 to 15 years and had confirmed GAS pharyngitis. Children completed the scale at study visits and as a diary at home. To evaluate internal reliability, we examined correlations between the items on the scale. To evaluate construct validity, we examined the correlation at entry between Strep-PRO scores and scores on other, previously validated measures of pain and functional status. To evaluate responsiveness, we examined the change in score from enrollment to follow-up. The correlation between the Strep-PRO score and parental assessment of symptoms was also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 131 children were enrolled; 113 returned completed diaries. The internal reliability of the scale was high. The magnitude of correlations between Strep-PRO scores and other measures of pain and functional status ranged from 0.39 to 0.63. The responsiveness of the Strep-PRO was very good. The overall level of agreement between child Strep-PRO scores and parental assessment of symptoms was 0.57. CONCLUSIONS: The scale seems to measure effectively both pain and overall functional status in children with GAS pharyngitis. These data support the use of Strep-PRO as a measure of outcome in future clinical trials.",M2
19748913,"In vitro evaluation of five rapid antigen detection tests for group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal sore throat infections.BACKGROUND: Using accurate and easy to use rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) to identify group A beta-haemolytic Streptococci (GABHS) sore throat infections could reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and antimicrobial resistance. Although there is no international consensus on the use of RADTs, these kits have been widely adopted in Finland, France and the USA. Yet in the UK, the Clinical Knowledge Summaries, that provide the main online guidance for GPs, discourage RADTs use, citing their poor sensitivity and inability to impact on prescribing decisions in acute sore throat infections. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ease of use and in vitro accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the five most commonly used RADTs in Europe (OSOM Ultra, Quickvue Dipstick, Streptatest, Clearview Exact <e>Strep</e> A and IMI Test Pack). METHODS: To ensure the RADTs were evaluated objectively, a standardized in vitro method using known concentrations of GABHS was used to remove the inherent biases associated with clinical studies. RESULTS: The IMI Test Pack was the easiest RADT to use overall. The ability to detect all positive GABHS (sensitivity) varied considerably between kits from 95% [95% confidence interval (CI): 88-98%], for the IMI Test Pack and OSOM, to 62% (95% CI: 51-72%) for Clearview, at the highest GABHS concentration. None of the RADTs gave any false-positive results with commensal flora-they were 100% specific. CONCLUSIONS: The IMI Test Pack is most suitable for use in primary care, as it had high sensitivity, high specificity and was easy to use.",M2
19737105,"Molecular pathogenesis of necrotizing fasciitis.Necrotizing fasciitis, also known as the flesh-eating disease, is a severe invasive infection associated with very high rates of human morbidity and mortality. It is most commonly caused by group A Streptococcus(GAS), a versatile human pathogen that causes diseases ranging in severity from uncomplicated pharyngitis (or <e>strep</e> throat) to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. Herein, we review recent discoveries bearing on the molecular pathogenesis of GAS necrotizing fasciitis. Importantly, the integration of new technologies and the development of human-relevant animal models have markedly expanded our understanding of the key pathogen-host interactions underlying GAS necrotizing fasciitis. For example, we now know that GAS organisms secrete a variety of proteases that disrupt host tissue and that these proteolytic enzymes are regulated by multiple transcriptional and posttranslational processes. This pathogenesis knowledge will be crucial to supporting downstream efforts that seek to develop novel vaccines and therapeutic agents for this serious human infection.",M2

Age ranged from 5 to 17 years. The variables recorded were age, sex, socioeconomic status, clinical features, and laboratory findings. Clinical selection was based on cardiac auscultation. Data analysis was performed using the Epi Data 3.1 and Stata 8.2 software packages (differences being considered as significant at p&lt; 0.05).

Biochemical testing included Rapid ID 32 <e>Strep</e>, API Strep, Fluo-Card Milleri, Wee-tabs, and Lancefield antigen typing. Altogether, 61 Anginosus group isolates from skin and soft tissue infections and four reference strains were included. Our results showed a good agreement between 16S rRNA gene and tuf gene sequencing. Using the full sequence was less discriminatory than using the first part of the 16S rRNA gene. The three species could not be separated with the API 20 Strep test. Streptococcus intermedius could be differentiated from the other two species by beta-galactosidase (ONPG) and beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase reactions. Rapid ID 32 Strep beta-glucosidase reaction was useful in separating S. anginosus strains from S. constellatus. In conclusion, both 16S rRNA gene and tuf gene sequencing can be used for the reliable identification of the Anginosus group streptococci. S. intermedius can be readily differentiated from the other two species by phenotypic tests; however, 16S rRNA gene or tuf gene sequencing may be needed for separating some strains of S. constellatus from S. anginosus.",M2

Surveillance for severe cases of S. pyogenes infection diagnosed during 2003 and 2004 was undertaken in 11 countries across Europe by using a standardized case definition and questionnaire. Patient data as well as bacterial isolates were collected and characterized by T and M/emm typing, and selected strains were analyzed for the presence of superantigen genes. Data were analyzed to compare the clinical and microbiological patterns of the infections across the participating countries. A total of 4,353 isolates were collected from 5,521 cases with severe S. pyogenes infections who were identified. A wide diversity of M/emm types (n = 104) was found among the S. pyogenes clinical isolates, but the M/emm type distribution varied broadly between participating countries. The 10 most predominant M/emm types were M/emm type 1 (M/emm1), M/emm28, M/emm3, M/emm89, M/emm87, M/emm12, M/emm4, M/emm83, M/emm81, and M/emm5, in descending order. A correlation was found between some specific disease manifestations, the age of the patients, and the emm types. Although streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis were caused by a large number of types, they were particularly associated with M/emm1 and M/emm3.

IDUs presented with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including pneumonia, which was found to be significantly more common in IDUs (OR 3.00) than in other cases. Marked differences in type distributions were found between IDUs and other cases, in particular the concentration of emm/M83 (22% of IDUs, 2% of non-IDUs). These findings indicate that an epidemic of severe S. pyogenes infections in IDUs occurred in the UK, peaking in 2003. The explanation for this rise remains unclear.",M2

18845045,"An evaluation of a rapid real time polymerase chain reaction assay for detection of group B streptococcus as part of a neonatal group B streptococcus prevention strategy.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility of a rapid real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for group B streptococcus (GBS) completed during labour, compared with the standard culture test performed at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation. METHODS: Women presenting to the maternity unit for term vaginal delivery had two vaginal/rectal samples collected. One swab was tested using a rapid PCR method (IDI-<e>Strep</e> B, Infectio Diagnostic [IDI] Inc., Sainte-Foy QC ), and the other was cultured after enrichment (intrapartum culture). Comparisons were made between these results and those of a culture-based screen at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation. RESULTS: Of the 190 women enrolled, 85% had results of the standard screen at 35 to 37 weeks available for comparison. The sensitivity and specificity of the standard 35- to 37-week screen were 84.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71.4-93.0) and 93.2% (95% CI 86.5-97.2) respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid PCR were 90.7% (95% CI 79.7-96.9) and 97.6% (95% CI 93.1-99.5), respectively. The median reporting time for the rapid PCR test was 99 minutes (range 50-255). Results were available more than four hours before delivery in 81% of cases. CONCLUSION: In this Canadian centre, a rapid PCR test done at the time of labour (IDI-Strep B) demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, comparable to the 35- to 37-week screen. The time to reporting results was acceptably short, allowing for timely administration of intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics.",M2

18463210,"Epidemiology of severe Streptococcus pyogenes disease in Europe.The past 2 decades have brought worrying increases in severe Streptococcus pyogenes diseases globally. To investigate and compare the epidemiological patterns of these diseases within Europe, data were collected through a European Union FP-5-funded program (<e>Strep</e>-EURO). Prospective population-based surveillance of severe S. pyogenes infection diagnosed during 2003 and 2004 was undertaken in 11 countries across Europe (Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) using a standardized case definition. A total of 5,522 cases were identified across the 11 countries during this period. Rates of reported infection varied, reaching 3/100,000 population in the northern European countries. Seasonal patterns of infection showed remarkable congruence between countries. The risk of infection was highest among the elderly, and rates were higher in males than in females in most countries. Skin lesions/wounds were the most common predisposing factor, reported in 25% of cases; 21% had no predisposing factors reported. Skin and soft tissue were the most common foci of infection, with 32% of patients having cellulitis and 8% necrotizing fasciitis. The overall 7-day case fatality rate was 19%; it was 44% among patients who developed streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The findings from Strep-EURO confirm a high incidence of severe S. pyogenes disease in Europe. Furthermore, these results have identified targets for public health intervention, as well as raising awareness of severe S. pyogenes disease across Europe.",M2
18314283,"Microbiology of otitis externa in the secondary care in United Kingdom and antimicrobial sensitivity.INTRODUCTION: Otitis externa is one of the most common conditions seen in the otolaryngology clinics. There are no recently published studies that have looked at the causative pathogens of the otitis externa seen in secondary care in the United Kingdom and their antimicrobial sensitivities. We present results of a prospective study to determine the current bacteriology of the condition. METHODS: Swabs were taken from the external auditory canals of the patients who presented to the otolaryngology emergency clinic with symptoms of otitis externa. These were analysed using microscopy, culture and sensitivity testing in one laboratory. The samples were cultured on blood agar, chocolate agar, Sabouraud agar, fastidious anaerobes agar with neomycin and staph/<e>strep</e> agar. Antimicrobial sensitivities of isolated pathogens were tested on iso-sensitest and blood agars using the BSAC disc diffusion template program. RESULTS: The most commonly identified pathogen was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (45.1%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (9%), anaerobes (6.3%), beta haemolytic Streptococcus group G (2.8%), beta haemolytic Streptococcus group A (1.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.7%), methicillin resistant S. aureus (0.7%), Candida species (9.7%), Aspergillus species (4.2%) and Absidia corymbifera (0.7%). One hundred percent resistance of Pseudomonas isolates to neomycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim and amoxicillin was observed while most were sensitive to ciprofloxacin (100%), polymixin B (100%) and gentamicin (98.5%). S. aureus isolates were sensitive to gentamicin and flucloxacillin (100%). 92.3% were sensitive to neomycin and chloramphenicol. Resistance to penicillin and amoxicillin is observed. All isolates anaerobes were sensitive to metronidazole. CONCLUSION: Polymixin B, gentamicin or ciprofloxacin topical preparations should be used as first line treatment of otitis externa. If the infection does not settle swab results should be used to guide further treatment.",M2
18255158,"Identification of species of viridans group streptococci in clinical blood culture isolates by sequence analysis of the RNase P RNA gene, rnpB.OBJECTIVES: Viridans group streptococci (VGS) cause severe diseases such as infective endocarditis and septicaemia. Genetically, VGS species are very close to each other and it is difficult to identify them to species level with conventional methods. The aims of the present study were to use sequence analysis of the RNase P RNA gene (rnpB) to identify VGS species in clinical blood culture isolates, and to compare the results with the API 20 <e>Strep</e> system that is based on phenotypical characteristics. METHODS: Strains from patients with septicaemia or endocarditis were analysed with PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the rnpB gene. Clinical data were registered as well. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty two VGS clinical blood culture isolates from patients with septicaemia (n=95) or infective endocarditis (n=36) were analysed; all but one were identified by rnpB. Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii strains were most common in the patients with infective endocarditis. In the isolates from patients with haematological diseases, Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis dominated. In addition in 76 of the isolates it was possible to compare the results from rnpB analysis and the API 20 Strep system. In 39/76 (51%) of the isolates the results were concordant to species level; in 55 isolates there were no results from API 20 Strep. CONCLUSION: Sequence analysis of the RNase P RNA gene (rnpB) showed that almost all isolates could be identified. This could be of importance for evaluation of the portal of entry in patients with septicaemia or infective endocarditis.",M2

A Test (SAT) as a rapid streptococcal antigen test, and its effect on antibiotic use in children. METHODS: This was a prospective study of children with acute catarrh, fever, and acutely inflamed throat/tonsils. Paired throat swabs for SAT and culture were collected. None of the children received antibiotics prior to testing. RESULTS: Five hundred and five children were included in the study: 278 were boys (55%) and 409 (81%) were aged under 5 years. The SAT was negative in 434 cases (86%) and positive in 71 (14%); culture was negative in 425 cases (84%) and positive in 80 (16%), including nine cultures that grew bacteria other than group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS). Both the SAT and culture were negative in 422 cases (84%) and positive in 68 (13%), but were inconsistent in 15 cases (3%). For GAS infection, the SAT positive predictive value was 95.8% (68/71). The negative predictive value for the whole group as well as for children under five years of age was over 99% (422/425 and 355/358, respectively). SAT sensitivity was almost 96%. Finally, only 74 children (15%) were given antibiotics, while a staggering 431 (85%) were not. CONCLUSION: The Diaquick Strep.

17963430,"Amoxicillin pulsatile - MiddleBrook: APC 111, APC-111, PULSYS-enhanced amoxicillin.MiddleBrook Pharmaceuticals (formerly Advancis Pharmaceutical) is developing an improved version of amoxicillin using its pulsatile oral drug delivery technology, called PULSYS. Amoxicillin PULSYS is intended to provide a lower treatment dose, once-daily alternative to currently approved amoxicillin and penicillin regimens for the treatment of adolescents/adults with pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis. If amoxicillin PULSYS is approved, it will be the first and only once-daily amoxicillin therapy approved for use in the US. Regulatory submissions for the treatment of pharyngitis/tonsillitis have been made in the US. Amoxicillin PULSYS is in clinical development for the treatment of pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis due to group A streptococcal infections in adolescents/adults as a tablet formulation. MiddleBrook was conducting clinical development of a sprinkle formulation for children. However, this has been put on hold for financial reasons. MiddleBrook is seeking regulatory approval for this product as a 505(b)(2) product, which is one that is not considered to be a completely new product, but is also not a generic product. It is a product with some differences from a previously approved product and clinical data to support such differences are required; however, the basic safety and efficacy studies may have been conducted by other organisations. In June 2007, Advancis Pharmaceutical was renamed as MiddleBrook Pharmaceuticals, Inc. MiddleBrook and Par Pharmaceuticals entered a co-promotion agreement for this product in June 2004. Par was to fund future development in exchange for co-exclusive marketing rights and exclusive rights to sell amoxicillin PULSYS. MiddleBrook retained responsibility for the manufacturing programme and also retained all patents and brand names and was responsible for their enforcement. However, this collaboration was subsequently terminated in August 2005 by Par Pharmaceutical. MiddleBrook received the US $4.75 million R&amp;D reimbursement payment due in the third quarter of 2005 and expects no further payments under the collaboration. Under certain circumstances, the termination clauses of the agreement may entitle Par to receive a share of net profits up to 50% of its total US $23 million investment in the development of certain amoxicillin PULSYS products, should a product covered by the agreement be successfully commercialised. Following the end of the first quarter of 2005, MiddleBrook entered into agreements with Clonmel Healthcare Ltd (STADA Group), which will provide MiddleBrook with commercial supply of its amoxicillin PULSYS products being evaluated in phase III trials. MiddleBrook has closed US $24 million in private placement of common equity; funds will be used to support the regulatory approval process for the once-daily amoxicillin pulsatile product. The company conducted phase III trials of this once-daily pulsatile amoxicillin product for the treatment of pharyngitis/tonsillitis due to group A streptococcal infections (commonly referred to as <e>strep</e> throat). Two trials of a 775 mg tablet formulation were conducted in adolescent/adult populations. In December 2006, the company entered into a definitive private placement agreement, raising US $18 million in gross proceeds. It intends to use the proceeds to prepare for the potential commercial launch of amoxicillin PULSYS and to continue the development of other products. The first of the adolescent/adult phase III trials was initiated in October 2004 in the US. This double-blind, non-inferiority, pivotal trial enrolled 510 such patients who received amoxicillin PULSYS 775 mg administered in tablet form once daily for 7 days or the US FDA standard comparator regimen, penicillin 250 mg administered four times daily for 10 days. However, in June 2005, the company reported that amoxicillin PULSYS failed to achieve the primary endpoint of this trial (i.e. bacterial eradication). The company initiated the second adolescent/adult phase III trial in November 2005. This two-arm, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority trial enrolled a total of 620 patients from the US and Canada. Patients received amoxicillin PULSYS (775 mg tablet once daily for 10 days) or the standard penicillin regimen previously mentioned. Top-line results presented in August 2006 showed that the desired microbiological and clinical endpoints were achieved in this trial. In addition, the trial showed that amoxicillin PULSYS achieved 85% bacterial eradication in the per-protocol population, in accordance with the FDA's guidance for approval as a first-line therapy for pharyngitis. MiddleBrook has completed a phase I dose finding trial of its paediatric 'sprinkle' formulation of amoxicillin PULSYS in healthy volunteers. The company commenced a two-arm, investigator-blinded, non-inferiority, US-based, phase III trial in Janary 2005 to evaluate a 'sprinkle' formulation of amoxicillin PULSYS among paediatric patients with acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by group A streptococcal infections. The drug was administered in multiparticulate granules, designed to be sprinkled over food, in two dosages: 475 mg once daily in patients aged 6 months to 4 years, and 775 mg once daily for children aged 5-12 years. Patients were given either 7 days' treatment with amoxicillin PULSYS or penicillin VK four times daily for 10 days. The primary endpoint of the paediatric trial was the same as the adult one. However, in July 2005, the company reported that the product failed to achieve its desired microbiological and clinical endpoints (primary and secondary) in this trial. MiddleBrook was to review the full data and evaluate what steps, if any, could be taken to improve future outcomes.",M2

The main objective was to improve understanding of the epidemiology of invasive GAS disease in Denmark. During the 2 years, 278 cases were reported, corresponding to a mean annual incidence of 2.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The vast majority of isolates, 253 (91%), were from blood, with the remaining 25 (9%) being from cerebrospinal fluid, joints, or other normally sterile sites. The mean case fatality rate (CFR) was 20%, with the rate being higher in patients more than 70 years of age (36.5%). For streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis the CFRs were 53% and 25%, respectively. Out of 16 T types recorded, three predominated: T28 (23%), T1 (22%), and the cluster T3/13/B3264 (14%). Among 29 different emm types, emm28 and emm1 accounted for 51% of strains, followed by emm3 (11%), emm89 (7%), and emm12 (5.5%). Low resistance rates were detected for macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) antibiotics (3%) and tetracycline (8%); two isolates exhibited coresistance to tetracycline and macrolides. Of nine pyrogenic exotoxin (superantigen) genes examined, speA and speC were identified in 58% and 40% of the strains, respectively; either of the genes was present in all strains causing STSS. Most strains harbored speG (99%). ssa was present in 14% of the isolates only.

To investigate the utility of immunochromatographic detection of group A streptococcus antigen, 116 clinical specimens obtained from pharyngeal membranes by swab were examined using a prompt diagnostic kit for group A streptococcus (ImmunoCard STAT! <e>STREP</e> A TEST) and conventional bacterial culture. Group A streptococcus positivity differed between the two methods. Fourteen patients were found to be positive by the prompt diagnostic kit and 23 by bacterial culture.

One aim of strep-EURO was to improve the quality of GAS characterization by standardization of methods. An external quality assurance study (EQA) was therefore carried out to evaluate current global performance. Eleven strep-EURO and seven other streptococcal reference centers received a panel of 20 coded GAS isolates for typing. Conventional phenotypic typing (based on cell surface T and M protein antigens and opacity factor [OF] production) and molecular methods (emm gene typing) were used either as single or combined approaches to GAS typing. T typing was performed by 16 centers; 12 centers found one or more of the 20 strains nontypeable (typeability, 89%), and 11 centers reported at least one incorrect result (concordance, 93%). The 10 centers that tested for OF production achieved 96% concordance. Limited availability of antisera resulted in poor typeability values from the four centers that performed phenotypic M typing (41%), three of which also performed anti-OF typing (typeability, 63%); however, concordance was high for both M (100%) and anti-OF (94%) typing. In contrast, the 15 centers that performed emm gene sequencing achieved excellent typeability (97%) and concordance (98%), although comparison of the performance between centers yielded typeability rates from 65 to 100% and concordance values from 83 to 100%.

The TNFA gene has been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, including RF. We investigated whether the G-308A and G-238A polymorphisms of the TNFA gene are associated with clinical outcomes of RF in a cohort of 318 patients and 281 healthy controls (HC). Both polymorphisms showed borderline associations with RF (TNFA -308G/A, OR=1.4 [1-2.2], P=0.026; TNFA -238G/A, OR=1.9 [1-3.3], P=0.015). The presence of either one of the minor alleles (-308A and -238A) was more common among patients with RF/RHD than controls (P=0.0006). Stratification of patients according to clinical phenotype also showed significant associations between presence of either one of the minor alleles and RHD (Pc=0.0006) when compared with controls. This association was stronger with the development of aortic valve lesions. In contrast, there was no association between genotype and Sydenham's chorea or RF patients with mild carditis. In conclusion, we show that the TNFA is a susceptibility locus for RF. The ability to predict which RF patients will develop valve lesion may have therapeutic, economic and social implications.",M2
17037069,"[Isolation and identification of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 from sick-pig samples of Sichuan province]Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a major pathogen frequently associated with infections in pigs. There are presently 35 serotypes of S.suis (serotype 1 to 34 and serotype 1/2) recognized on the basis of capsular antigens. Few people were reported to infect with SS2 in the past years. However, an accidental case happened in Sichuan province of China in 2005. Some people got ill and died, and all of them were closely contacted with sick pigs. Based on clinical features and epidemiologic data, this case could be caused by SS2 infection. Liver, spleen, kidney, lung and serum samples were collected and used for pathogen isolation and identification in laboratory, three strain bacteria were isolated. The three strains of SS2 showed typical morphology of SS2 on blood agar and under microscope with Gram stain. They were also agglutinated with standard serum of SS2. Biochemical characteristics of the three bacteria were tested using API 20 <e>strep</e> and analyzed by API software (version 3.3), results showed they were SS2. Four pairs of primer were designed, which were exactly matched the extracellular factor gene, muraminidase released protein gene, capsular polysaccharides gene and 16S rRNA gene respectively.

17005523,"Streptococcal PD peritonitis--a 10-year review of one centre's experience.BACKGROUND: Detailed descriptive studies focusing on streptococcal peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis are lacking. Most of the current information is available through isolated case reports. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of our peritoneal dialysis (PD) peritonitis database over the last decade to study the clinical profile and treatment outcomes of streptococcal peritonitis. RESULTS: A total of 68 patients (age: 57.12 +/- 16.6 years; male: 58.7%) with 104 episodes of streptococcal peritonitis (11.7% of total peritonitis) were identified. Of the patients, 18 (26.4%) were considered immunocompromised [failed renal transplant, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)] and 28 (41.1%) had diabetes. Streptococcus viridans accounted for the majority (94 episodes: 90.3%) of the streptococcal peritonitis. One patient developed S. viridans peritonitis after dental cleaning without antibiotic prophylaxis. Two (1.9%) infections with S. agalactiae and S. bovis each and seven (6.7%) with non-haemolytic Streptococcus were noted. Three patients had hospital-acquired infection. Twenty-six (25%) episodes needed 8 +/- 5.9 days of hospitalization. Concurrent infection with two organisms accounted for 17 (16.3%) episodes. Cefazolin (71) and vancomycin (29) were the primary antibiotics used for the treatment. Five episodes needed two antibiotics and one patient required antifungal treatment. A third of the patients (33.3%) had peritonitis that resolved slowly, although the majority of those (94%) did ultimately resolve with antibiotics alone. Five (4.8%) episodes required removal of the PD catheter. Three of them were associated with dual infections (one each with yeast, Stenotrophomonas and Enterococcus). Relapse occurred in eight (7.6%) episodes, and 11 (10.5%) recurred over the period from 4 weeks to 6 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococci remain a significant cause of PD peritonitis. Viridans <e>strep</e> is the primary subtype responsible. Isolated infections with these organisms are associated with slower response, good outcome and higher rates of recurrence.",M2

16849717,"Increased recovery of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae in association with group A beta-haemolytic streptococci in healthy children and those with pharyngo-tonsillitis.The inflamed tonsils harbour numerous types of bacteria, alone or in combination with group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). The cohabitation of the tonsils by GABHS and certain other bacterial species may contribute to the inflammatory process and the failure of penicillin therapy. This study evaluated the recovery of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in association with GABHS in healthy children and those with acute pharyngo-tonsillitis (APT). Pharyngo-tonsillar cultures were obtained from 548 children with APT and 866 healthy children. GABHS was recovered from 112 (20.4%) children with APT. Of the 114 H. influenzae isolates, 32 were recovered in association with GABHS (29% of all patients who had GABHS) and 82 were isolated without GABHS (19%) (P=0.0267). Of the 69 M. catarrhalis isolates, 25 were recovered in association with GABHS (22% of all patients who had GABHS) and 44 were isolated without GABHS (10%) (P=0.0012). In contrast, there was no association between the isolation of GABHS and the recovery of Staph. aureus or <e>Strep</e>. pneumoniae. GABHS was recovered from 104 (12%) healthy children. Of the 69 M. catarrhalis isolates, 24 were recovered in association with GABHS (23% of all patients who had GABHS) and 80 were isolated without GABHS (10%) (P=0.006). There was no association between the isolation of GABHS and the recovery of H. influenzae, Staph. aureus or Strep. pneumoniae. This study demonstrates an association between the recovery of GABHS and H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis from pharyngo-tonsillar cultures of patients with APT and M. catarrhalis from pharyngo-tonsillar cultures of healthy children.",M2
16696672,"A lacticin 3147 enriched food ingredient reduces Streptococcus mutans isolated from the human oral cavity in saliva.AIMS: To isolate and characterise Streptococcus mutans from Irish saliva samples and to assess their sensitivity to a food-grade preparation of the lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by Lactococcus lactis DPC3147. METHODS AND RESULTS: Saliva samples collected from children with varying oral health status were screened on Mitis Salivarius agar for the presence of pathogenic streptococci. Following selective plating, 16S rDNA sequencing and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), 15 distinct strains of <e>Strep</e>. mutans were identified. These were grouped according to their relative sensitivity to lacticin 3147 which ranged from 0.78 to 6.25%; relative to a sensitive indicator strain, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis HP. Inhibition of indicator Strep. mutans strains from sensitive, intermediate and tolerant groupings were assessed in microtitre plate assays with increasing concentrations of lacticin 3147. The concentration of lacticin 3147 required to give 50% growth inhibition correlated with their relative sensitivities (as assayed by well diffusion methodology) and ranged from 1280 to 5120 AU ml(-1). Concentrated preparations of lacticin 3147 caused a rapid killing of Strep. mutans strains in broth. Moreover, in human saliva deliberately spiked with Strep. mutans, the pathogen was eliminated (initial inoculum of 10(5)) in the presence of 40,000 AU ml(-1) of lacticin 3147. Furthermore, a food-grade lacticin 3147 spray dried powder ingredient was assessed for the inhibition of Strep. mutans in human saliva, spiked with a strain of intermediate sensitivity, resulting in up to a 4-log reduction in counts after 20 min. CONCLUSION: A food grade preparation of lacticin 3147 was effective in the inhibition of oral Strep. mutans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The inhibition of oral streptococci by food grade preparations of lacticin 3147 may offer novel opportunities for the development of lacticin 3147 as an anti-cariogenic agent particularly in the area of functional foods for the improvement of oral health.",M2

16533386,"Optimal management of adults with pharyngitis--a multi-criteria decision analysis.BACKGROUND: Current practice guidelines offer different management recommendations for adults presenting with a sore throat. The key issue is the extent to which the clinical likelihood of a Group A streptococcal infection should affect patient management decisions. To help resolve this issue, we conducted a multi-criteria decision analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. METHODS: We defined optimal patient management using four criteria: 1) reduce symptom duration; 2) prevent infectious complications, local and systemic; 3) minimize antibiotic side effects, minor and anaphylaxis; and 4) achieve prudent use of antibiotics, avoiding both over-use and under-use. In our baseline analysis we assumed that all criteria and sub-criteria were equally important except minimizing anaphylactic side effects, which was judged very strongly more important than minimizing minor side effects. Management strategies included: a) No test, No treatment; b) Perform a rapid <e>strep</e> test and treat if positive; c) Perform a throat culture and treat if positive; d) Perform a rapid strep test and treat if positive; if negative obtain a throat culture and treat if positive; and e) treat without further tests. We defined four scenarios based on the likelihood of group A streptococcal infection using the Centor score, a well-validated clinical index. Published data were used to estimate the likelihoods of clinical outcomes and the test operating characteristics of the rapid strep test and throat culture for identifying group A streptococcal infections. RESULTS: Using the baseline assumptions, no testing and no treatment is preferred for patients with Centor scores of 1; two strategies--culture and treat if positive and rapid strep with culture of negative results--are equally preferable for patients with Centor scores of 2; and rapid strep with culture of negative results is the best management strategy for patients with Centor scores 3 or 4. These results are sensitive to the priorities assigned to the decision criteria, especially avoiding over-use versus under-use of antibiotics, and the population prevalence of Group A streptococcal pharyngitis. CONCLUSION: The optimal clinical management of adults with sore throat depends on both the clinical probability of a group A streptococcal infection and clinical judgments that incorporate individual patient and practice circumstances.",M2

METHODS AND RESULTS: Human dental plaque samples were collected from the labial surfaces of the upper primary central incisors of 107 children. The dental status was recorded as dft by WHO caries diagnostic criteria. Positive dt and dft scores by the Sm or GTF-B primer were significantly higher than negative scores (P &lt; 0.01).

16373800,"Streptococcus A in paediatric accident and emergency: are rapid streptococcal tests and clinical examination of any help?BACKGROUND: Rapid streptococcal tests (RSTs) for streptococcal pharyngitis have made diagnosis at once simpler and more complicated. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all RSTs be confirmed by a follow up throat culture unless local validation has proved the RST to be equally sensitive. AIMS: To evaluate (a) RST as a single diagnostic tool, compared with RST with or without throat culture; (b) clinical diagnosis and the relative contribution of different symptoms. METHODS: The study included 213 patients with clinical signs of pharyngitis. Throat swabs were analysed using Quickvue+ <e>Strep</e> A Test; negative RSTs were backed up by throat culture. Thirteen clinical features commonly associated with strep throat were analysed using backward stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: Positive results (RST or throat culture) were obtained in 33 patients; RST correctly identified 21. Eleven samples were false negative on RST. At a strep throat prevalence of 15.9%, sensitivity of RST was 65.6% (95% CI 46.8% to 81.4%) and specificity 99.4% (96.7% to 99.9%). Sensitivity of clinical diagnosis alone was 57% (34% to 78%) and specificity 71% (61% to 80%). Clinically, only history of sore throat, rash, and pyrexia contributed to the diagnosis of strep throat (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The high specificity of RST facilitates early diagnosis of strep throat. However, the low sensitivity of RST does not support its use as a single diagnostic tool. The sensitivity in the present study is markedly different from that reported by the manufacturer. Clinical examination is of limited value in the diagnosis of strep throat. It is important to audit the performance of new diagnostic tests, previously validated in different settings.",M2

16272396,"The streptococcal iron uptake (Siu) transporter is required for iron uptake and virulence in a zebrafish infection model.A limited understanding of iron uptake mechanisms is available for Streptococcus pyogenes, a haemolytic human pathogen capable of using a variety of haemoproteins in addition to ferric and ferrous iron. This study characterizes a transporter named siu (for streptococcal iron uptake), which consists of an ATP-binding protein (SiuA), a substrate-binding protein (SiuD), and two membrane permease subunits (SiuBG). An siuG mutant was constructed and characterized. The mutant demonstrated growth reduction in comparison to the parent strain when grown in complex medium containing iron in the form of blood, haemoglobin or serum. Only a small reduction in the growth of the siuG mutant was observed in medium containing ferric iron. However, in iron uptake assays the siuG mutant showed a decrease of approximately 30 % in Fe3+ incorporation. Addition of 6 microM haem to the medium inhibited Fe3+ uptake by the wild-type by 76 %, while addition of protoporphyrin IX did not, suggesting that utilization of haem as an iron source is responsible for the inhibition of Fe3+ uptake. Inactivation of siuG moderately reduced the ability of haem to inhibit Fe3+ incorporation by the cells. Inactivation of siaB (encoding a membrane permease of a second iron transporter) had a similar outcome, and inactivation of both transporters had a cumulative effect. These observations implicate both the siu and sia transporters in haem utilization by <e>Strep</e>. pyogenes. Studies in a zebrafish infection model revealed that the siuG mutant was attenuated in both intramuscular and intraperitoneal routes of infection. Together these observations show that the siu system is an iron acquisition pathway in Strep. pyogenes that is important both in vitro and in vivo.",M2

METHODS: Children aged 5 to 18 years with acute pharyngitis were randomized to 1 of 2 study groups. In group 1, one throat swab was obtained, streaked first on sheep blood agar, and then used for OIA MAX testing. In group 2, two throat swabs were obtained simultaneously. One swab was streaked first on sheep blood agar and then joined with the other swab for OIA MAX testing. In both groups, the pledgets in the collection-transport tube were incubated in Todd-Hewitt broth. A positive group A streptococcus culture either by sheep blood agar or Todd-Hewitt broth was confirmed by a latex agglutination test. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-three patients were enrolled, 177 in group 1 and 186 in group 2. Cultures were positive for group A streptococcus in 154 (42.4%) of 363 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of OIA MAX testing were 94.7% and 100.0%, respectively, in group 1, and 92.4% and 96.3%, respectively, in group 2. There was no statistical difference between the sensitivity, the specificity, and the predictive values of the OIA MAX test performed with 1 swab compared with those performed with 2 swabs (P&gt;.10). There was no association between OIA MAX test sensitivity and the severity of pharyngitis as measured by the modified Centor criterion (history of fever, absence of cough, presence of pharyngeal or tonsillar exudates, and presence of cervical lymphadenopathy) scores. CONCLUSIONS: The OIA MAX test yielded comparable sensitivity and specificity in both study groups. The use of 2 throat swabs instead of 1 swab did not increase the sensitivity of the OIA MAX test. The performance of the OIA MAX test did not depend on the severity of pharyngitis.",M2

15786581,"Interim UK guidelines for management of close community contacts of invasive group A streptococcal disease.Group A streptococci cause a wide range of illnesses from non-invasive disease such as pharyngitis to more severe invasive infections such as necrotising fasciitis. There remains uncertainty about the risk of invasive disease among close contacts of an index case of invasive disease and whether this risk warrants antibiotic prophylaxis. A 19-200 fold increased risk among household contacts has been reported in the literature. Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis regimens vary by country. A comprehensive literature review together with preliminary analysis of 2003 United Kingdom data from the <e>strep</e>-EURO programme informed the interim recommendations of an expert working group. The evidence base to formulate definitive guidance is weak. Risk calculations based on provisional UK data estimated that over 2,000 contacts would need to receive antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent a subsequent case of invasive group A streptococcal disease. The Working Group considered that currently available evidence did not warrant the routine administration of chemoprophylaxis to all close community contacts. More robust risk estimates will be derived from ongoing UK surveillance data to inform a review of this guidance in 2005.",M2
15771700,"Immune response to a laminin-binding protein (Lmb) in group A streptococcal infection.BACKGROUND: A laminin-binding protein (Lmb) similar to that of group B streptococcus is conserved in group A streptococcus (GAS) and has a role in adhesion of GAS to epithelial cells. The role of this protein is yet to be clarified in disease process and thus, it is important to know its role in binding of GAS to laminin and the immunogenic response against it in patients related with GAS infection. METHODS: A recombinant protein (rGAS-Lmb) was purified using the lmb gene from M1 GAS and tested for its role in binding of GAS with laminin. The antibody response against rGAS-Lmb in patient sera related with GAS infection was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The rGAS-Lmb bound with laminin directly and inhibited the binding of GAS to laminin. The antibody response against rGAS-Lmb in patients with uncomplicated streptococcal infection (U. <e>Strep</e>) and those with rheumatic fever (RF) were significantly higher than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). No difference of anti-rGAS-Lmb antibody titer could be found between these two disease groups. CONCLUSION: The higher antibody response in patients with GAS infection implies that the protein is well expressed during the period of infection and may be related with the colonization and infection of GAS in pharyngeal mucosa.",M2
15615463,"[Value of a rapid test for identification of beta-hemolytic streptococcus antigens in children with streptococcal pharyngitis]Beta-hemolytic group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is the most common bacterial agent associated with the upper respiratory tract infections in humans. The most frequently group A streptococcus-associated disease is pharyngitis. Males and females are equally affected by group A streptococcus. There is seasonal increase in the prevalence of group A streptococcus-associated pharyngitis. Streptococcal pharyngitis is most prevalent in winter and early spring with higher incidence of disease observed in crowded population such as school children. Early diagnosis and treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis has been shown to reduce the severity of symptoms and further complications such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. The conventional methods used for identification of group A streptococci depend on isolation and identification of the organism on blood agar plates. These methods usually require 18-24 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Such delay in identifying the group A streptococcus has often made physicians to administer therapy without first disclosing the etiological agent. Development of immunologic tests, capable of detecting the group A streptococcal antigen directly from the throat swabs, produced rapid test results employed for better treatment of patients. <e>STREP</e> A test is a rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of group A streptococci from throat swabs or culture. The accuracy of the test does not depend on the organism viability. Instead, group A strep antigen is extracted directly from the swab and identified using antibodies specific for the group A carbohydrates. We compared rapid test with conventional throat swab in 40 children, who met Centor criteria for streptococcal pharyngitis (absence of cough, high fever, purulent pharyngitis, enlarged and painful cervica lymph nodes). Overall congruence of rapid test and culture was 94%. Test is easy to perform and it is recommended as the first diagnostic test for management of children with streptococcal pharyngitis. In children with negative test, but with characteristics highly suggestive of streptococcal infection, throat culture should be performed.",M2

The accuracy of patients' report of signs and symptoms remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We compared the agreement between patient self-assessment and clinician assessment on the typical signs and symptoms of group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) to investigate the potential difficulties of using patient self-report to triage sore throat patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, each of 200 adult pharyngitis patients was instructed to examine him/herself and to record the symptoms and physical findings. Two clinicians independently interviewed and examined each patient and recorded their findings. Each patient then had a rapid GABHS antigen test, the results of which were blinded to both clinicians and patients. Each patient self-assessment was compared with the findings of each clinician, and the agreement and disagreement between them computed. RESULTS: We found varying levels of agreement (kappa=-0.05 to 0.71) between patients and clinicians on sore throat history and physical assessments. Importantly, there was fair to substantial agreement (kappa=0.20-0.71) on the key signs and symptoms used in GABHS clinical prediction rules. As expected, history items had the highest agreement (kappa=0.52-0.71). Patients were more likely than clinicians to report rather than deny a specific physical sign. CONCLUSION: Adult sore throat patients may reliably report their symptoms, but may not be able to assess and report accurately on relevant physical signs of pharyngitis. Patients have a tendency to over-report physical signs. This study indicates the potential difficulties associated with telephone triage of sore throat patients, or other illnesses that require assessment of physical signs.",M2

All three patients had infective endocarditis complicating their underlying chronic rheumatic heart diseases. Gene sequencing showed no base differences between the 16S rRNA gene sequences of HKU5 and HKU6 and that of HKU4T. All three strains were Gram-positive, non-spore-forming cocci arranged in chains. All grew on sheep blood agar as alpha-haemolytic, grey colonies of 0.5-1 mm in diameter after 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C in ambient air. Lancefield grouping revealed that HKU5 and HKU6 were Lancefield group F, but HKU4T was non-groupable with Lancefield groups A, B, C, D, F or G antisera.

Strategies for controlling <e>Strep</e>. uberis mastitis are poorly defined and are currently inadequate. Objectives of the present study were to evaluate efficacy of ceftiofur, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic, for treatment of experimentally induced Strep. uberis intramammary infections (IMI) in lactating dairy cows during early lactation and to determine whether extended therapy regimens enhanced efficacy of ceftiofur. Efficacy of extended ceftiofur intramammary therapy regimens was investigated in 37 mammary quarters of 23 dairy cows that developed clinical mastitis following experimental infection with Strep. uberis during early lactation. Cows that developed clinical mastitis during the challenge period were allocated randomly to 3 groups representing 3 different ceftiofur treatment regimens: 2-d (n = 7 mammary quarters), 5-d (n = 16 mammary quarters), and 8-d (n = 14 mammary quarters) treatment regimens. For all groups, 125 mg of ceftiofur hydrochloride was administered via intramammary infusion. A bacteriological cure was defined as an experimentally infected quarter that was treated and was bacteriologically negative for the presence of Strep. uberis at 7, 14, 21, and 28 d posttreatment.

Ceftiofur is a new broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic for veterinary use that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with enzymes essential for peptidoglycan synthesis. Ceftiofur should be effective against a wide range of contagious and environmental mastitis pathogens. Objectives of the present study were to evaluate the efficacy of ceftiofur for treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows, and to determine if extended therapy regimens enhanced efficacy of ceftiofur. Holstein and Jersey dairy cows (n = 88) from 3 dairy research herds were used. Cows were enrolled in the study based on milk somatic cell counts &gt;400,000/mL and isolation of the same mastitis pathogen in 2 samples obtained 1 wk apart. Cows with one or more intramammary infections (IMI) were blocked by parity and DIM and allocated randomly to 1 of 3 different ceftiofur treatment regimens: 2-d (n = 49 IMI), 5-d (n = 41 IMI), and 8-d (n = 38 IMI) treatment regimens. For all groups, 125 mg of ceftiofur hydrochloride was administered via intramammary infusion. Eighteen cows with 38 IMI were included as an untreated negative control group. A bacteriological cure was defined as a treated infected mammary quarter that was bacteriologically negative for the presence of previously identified bacteria at 14 and 28 d after the last treatment. Efficacy of ceftiofur therapy against all subclinical IMI was 38.8, 53.7, and 65.8% for the 2-, 5-, and 8-d ceftiofur treatment regimens, respectively.

The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus mitis group strains isolated from Romanian patients with different oral and maxillofacial infections. METHODS: Eighty-five isolates belonging to S. mitis group isolated from pus samples were identified at species level by the Rapid ID 32 <e>STREP</e> system. The E test was used to determine the susceptibilities of the isolates to penicillin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. RESULTS: Of the 151 samples studied, 85 isolates belonged to S. mitis group. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values (mg/l) ranged from 0.016-0.75 for penicillin, 0.016-2 for ampicillin, 0.016- 1 for cefotaxime, 0.016-4 for erythromycin, 0.016-0.047 for clindamycin, 0.5-4 for chloramphenicol and 0.047-256 for tetracycline. INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: The low susceptibility and the resistance to some commonly used antibiotics found in this study indicated a need for a careful surveillance of the susceptibility pattern of oral streptococci isolates of clinical significance.

The following species were identified: S. oralis (n = 67), S. mitis (n = 66), S. sanguis (n = 7), S. salivarius (n = 5), S. parasanguis (n = 4), S. gordonii (n = 3) and S. mutans (n = 3). S. oralis and S. mitis demonstrated the highest levels of resistance to the agents tested. There were 27% of S. oralis isolates resistant to pencillin, 51% resistant to erythromycin and 6% resistant to clindamycin. For S. mitis 11% were resistant to penicillin, 40% resistant to erythromycin and 3% resistant to clindamycin. Penicillin resistant isolates (MIC &gt; or = 2 mg/l) also demonstrated decreased susceptibility to other antimicrobial agents tested in this study. High level resistance (MIC &gt; or = 2 mg/l) to ceftriaxone was found in 12 isolates. The isolates identified as ceftriaxone resistant comprised S. oralis (n = 7), S. mitis (n = 4) and S. parasanguis (n = 1). This study has highlighted the difference in susceptibility between different species of viridans group streptococci. These findings are of concern in the light of spread of antibiotic resistance genes from S. oralis and S. mitis to the more invasive pneumococcus.",M2

15083242,"Bacteremic Streptococcus bovis infections at a university hospital, 1992-2001.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The association of Streptococcus bovis biotypes with types of clinical infection and underlying malignancies has rarely been reported in Taiwan. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical features and microbiological characteristics of patients with S. bovis bacteremia. METHODS: From January 1992 to December 2001, 62 patients with S. bovis bacteremia were treated at National Taiwan University Hospital. Their demographic characteristics, clinical features, results of imaging studies, pathological findings, and laboratory data were retrospectively analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using the agar dilution method and biotypes were determined using the API 20 <e>Strep</e> system. RESULTS: The majority of cases (76%) occurred during the 1996-1997 and 1999-2000 periods. Thirty five patients were male, and the mean age of the 62 patients was 61 years. Underlying diseases included malignancies (40%), cardiac diseases (27%), diabetes mellitus (24%), and liver cirrhosis (21%). Fifty two percent (n = 32) of patients presented with primary bacteremia and 24% (15) with definite or possible infective endocarditis. Thirteen percent (8) presented with hepatobiliary infections (acute cholecystitis and biliary tract infection). Ten patients (16%) had polymicrobial bacteremia. All of the concomitant pathogen(s) were Gram-negative rods, among which Escherichia coli predominated. The mortality rate on day 30 of illness was 21%. High Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score on the day of positive blood culture was associated with high mortality. Among the 19 patients (31%) who underwent colonoscopy, 9 (47%) had colonic lesions (tubular adenomas or carcinomas). Of the 26 patients (41%) who underwent echocardiography, 14 (54%) had vegetation in the valves. Of the 47 S. bovis isolates examined for biotypes, 37 (79%) were biotype II (29 of biotype II/2 and 8 of biotype II/1) and 10 (21%) were biotype I. The majority of isolates causing primary bacteremia (92%), hepatobiliary infections (100%) and primary bacterial peritonitis (100%) were biotype II, while 67% of isolates associated with infective endocarditis were biotype I. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Infective endocarditis should be highly suspected in patients with bacteremia due to S. bovis biotype I. Investigations for intra-abdominal foci other than the colon should be undertaken in patients with bacteremia caused by S. bovis biotype II. Due to the increasing number of S. bovis bacteremia patients at the hospital and unknown origins of about 50% of bacteremia cases, the need for colonoscopy and echocardiography in each case and biotyping of each blood isolate should be emphasized.",M2

Of course, women don't have to accept the recommended intravenous antibiotics in labour (or an ECM test, either privately or if available on the NHS) if they choose not to. But surely they should have access to good-quality information so they can make an informed choice about what is right for them and for their unborn baby?

14972375," Streptococcus milleri  endocarditis caused by Streptococcus anginosus.Unlike other viridans streptococci, members of the  Streptococcus milleri group  are often associated with abscess formation, but are only rare causes of infective endocarditis. Although it has been shown that almost all S. intermedius isolates and most S. constellatus isolates, but only 19% of S. anginosus isolates, were associated with abscess formation, no report has addressed the relative importance of the 3 species of the  S. milleri group  in infective endocarditis. During a 5-year period (April 1997 through March 2002), 6 cases of  S. milleri  endocarditis (out of 377 cases of infective endocarditis), that fulfil the Duke's criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, were encountered. All 6  S. milleri  isolates were identified as S. anginosus by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. Three patients had underlying chronic rheumatic heart disease and 1 was an IV drug abuser. Five had monomicrobial bacteremia, and 1 had polymicrobial (S. anginosus, S. mitis, Granulicatella adiacens, and Slackia exigua) bacteremia. Two patients died. None of the 6 isolates were identified by the Vitek system (GPI) or the API system (20 <e>STREP</e>) at &gt;95% confidence. All 6 isolates were sensitive to penicillin G (MIC 0.008-0.064 microg/mL), cefalothin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. Accurate identification to the species level, by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, in cases of bacteremia caused by members of the  S. milleri group , would have direct implication on the underlying disease process, hence guiding diagnosis and treatment. Infective endocarditis should be actively looked for in cases of monomicrobial S. anginosus bacteremia, especially if the organism is recovered in multiple blood cultures.",M2

One hundred twenty Holstein cows were experimentally challenged in a 22-wk trial with Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus and 148 Holstein cows were experimentally challenged with Streptococcus uberis in another 22-wk trial. The bacterial suspensions were applied to teats of all of the cows after premilking udder preparation and immediately prior to milking machine attachment. In both trials, cows were divided among four treatments: no postmilking teat dipping; manual postmilking teat dipping with a proven efficacious iodophor teat dip; manual postmilking teat dipping with an iodophor teat dip formulated for an automatic postmilking teat dipping system; and automatically postmilking teat dipping via milking machines with an iodophor teat dip formulated for the automatic postmilking teat dipping system. The postmilking teat dipping treatments reduced new Staph. aureus IMI by 64.5, 76.5, and 88.2%; new <e>Strep</e>. agalactiae IMI by 61.5, 77.8, and 94.4%; and new Strep. uberis IMI by 63.5, 82.5, and 93.8%, respectively, against the treatment of no postmilking teat dipping. The treatment applying the postmilking teat dip automatically via milking machines had the lowest number of new IMI caused by the three pathogens.

Contradictory results have been found for one of the more recent tests, the optical immune assay <e>Strep</e> A OIA MAX, while for 6 years, we have been using the immune assay Strep A Plus. Results of the optical immunoassay and the conventional immune assay Strep A Plus were compared in 65 patients with acute pharyngitis.

While both assays were equally sensitive (78.3%), Strep A OIA MAX and Strep A Plus had a similar specificity of 95.2% and 100%, respectively. Four and nine steps were required for Strep A Plus and for Strep A OIA MAX test procedures, respectively with results being available in 4-5 min and in 9-10 min, respectively. We conclude that both rapid immunoassays have a similar reliability while the handling of the Strep A Plus is much simpler than the handling of the Strep A OIA MAX.

Nevertheless patients are symptomatic and effective alternatives for its treatment are needed that have been evaluated in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To confirm that treatment with an extract of Pelargonium sidoides (EPs 7630) is superior to placebo for the treatment of non-GABHS tonsillopharyngitis in children. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Six study sites in 4 pediatric and ENT primary care outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: One hundred forty-three children aged 6-10 years with non-GABHS tonsillopharyngitis present &lt; or = 48 h, a negative rapid strep screen, a Tonsillopharyngitis Severity Score (TSS) &gt; or = 8 points, and informed consent. INTERVENTION: EPs 7630 or placebo (20 drops tid) for 6 days. MEASUREMENT: The primary outcome criterion was the decrease of the TSS from baseline (day 0) to day 4. RESULTS: The decrease of the TSS from baseline (day 0) to day 4 was 7.1 +/- 2.1 points under EPs 7630 (n = 73), and 2.5 +/- 3.6 points under placebo (n = 70). The covariate adjusted decrease was 7.0 +/- 2.4 points under EPs 7630, and 2.9 +/- 2.4 points under placebo.

12969551,"A highly sensitive immuno-PCR assay for detecting Group A Streptococcus.A highly sensitive hybrid assay, based on immuno polymerase chain reaction (immuno-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques, was developed for the detection of pathogenic Group A Streptococcus (<e>Strep</e> A). Cells were disrupted by sonication and then coated onto the walls of Maxisorp microtiter plates. Next, biotinylated anti-Group A monoclonal antibody (mAb) was bound to the antigen and then linked, via a streptavidin (STV) bridge, to biotinylated reporter DNA. After extensive washing, the denatured reporter DNA was transferred to PCR tubes, amplified, electrophoresed, and used as the signal for detection of bacteria. The minimum detection limit of this assay is the equivalent of approximately one one-thousandth of a Streptococcus pyogenes cell, even in the presence of 100,000 Escherichia coli cells. The combination of multiple antigens per cell and PCR amplification provides the extreme sensitivity in this immuno-PCR assay. No cross-reaction was found with other Streptococcus species. We also directly linked the anti-Group A monoclonal antibody to DNA using succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). The sensitivity using directly linked antibody-reporter DNA was approximately 10 cells. Because this assay could be adapted for detection of many different bacteria in a variety of sample types, we tested the potential for interference from substances that could be present in clinical, food, and environmental samples. Sonicated meat or human plasma did not inhibit detection; however, extracts of concentrated soil samples were somewhat inhibitory. This highly specific, sensitive, and robust assay could be applied to clinical detection of Group A Streptococcus and serves as a model for other immuno-PCR assays.",M2
12913775,"Extrapharyngeal group A Streptococcus infection: diagnostic accuracy and utility of rapid antigen testing.BACKGROUND: Antigen tests have been well-studied and are widely used in pediatric practice for rapid detection of group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections in the throat, but they have not been examined sufficiently for the detection of infection of skin sites, such as the perineal region or impetiginous lesions. METHODS: During the 3-year period 1999 to 2002, we evaluated 239 patients with suspected GAS skin infection, in 5 pediatric practices, using 3 Dacron swabs for each site. The first swab was tested in the pediatric office laboratory with an antigen detection kit. For the first 91 patients, the Abbott Test Pack Plus antigen detection test (ADT) was used. The Abbott Signify <e>Strep</e> A ADT was used to test subsequent patients. The second swab was tested with BD Directigen 1-2-3 ADT in the hospital laboratory. The third swab was placed in modified Stuart's transport medium for comparison of recovery of GAS from culture in broth or on agar. A positive culture served as the reference standard. Test performance and test accuracy were determined for each ADT. RESULTS: Of the 247 ADTs and cultures performed on 239 patients, 91 with suspected skin infection were tested with the Test Pack Plus test, 149 with the Signify Strep A test and 247 with the Directigen test. Eighty-six (35%) cultures were positive, 73 from perineal sites (54 rectal, 13 vaginal, 6 penile) and 13 from impetiginous lesions. There was 100% concordance for the 86 cultures positive for GAS in a comparison between dry Dacron swabs and swabs that had been placed in modified Stuart's transport medium. Test Pack Plus and Signify Strep A ADTs had similar performance characteristics for skin infections: sensitivity, 92 and 88%; specificity, 99 and 97%; positive predictive value, 96 and 94%; and negative predictive value, 97 and 93%. Directigen ADT had sensitivity 78%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100% and negative predictive value 89%. Accuracy for the tests varied from 92 to 97%.

12886983,"Multifocal myoclonus following group A streptococcal infection.Movement disorders as postinfectious manifestation of group A streptococcal infections have been reported and are thought to occur on an autoimmune basis. We describe an unusual case of multifocal myoclonus following <e>strep</e> throat infection. Clinical description and chart review were the method used. A 10-year-old boy developed focal myoclonus involving his right arm and shoulder 1 week after streptococcal throat infection treated with penicillin. His magnetic resonance image was normal, and he initially responded to clonazepam but did not sustain a response. The myoclonus spread to involve all limbs and the trunk becoming multifocal over the next few weeks. He did not have choreoathetosis of Syndenham's chorea. He was given one course of intravenous immunoglobulin and became asymptomatic after treatment. He remained symptom free for 8 months following intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. Various symptoms have been reported following group A streptococcal infections in children. These neurobehavioral abnormalities may be mediated through antineuronal antibodies. Our case demonstrates multifocal myoclonus as a poststreptococcal autoimmune phenomenon. To our knowledge, only two other cases of poststreptococcal myoclonus have been reported in the literature. Recognition of this unusual condition as a manifestation of autoimmune poststreptococcal disease in children is essential to avoid overinvestigation and to ensure early treatment.",M2
12862498,"Perineal streptococcal dermatitis/disease: recognition and management.Perianal streptococcal dermatitis (PSD) is a pediatric dermatologic infectious disease predominantly affecting children, particularly younger children, which is most commonly caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). Although the clinical picture of a sharply demarcated erythema is very characteristic, PSD is often misdiagnosed for long periods of time and patients are subjected to treatments for a variety of differential diagnoses. Vulvar and penile involvement with similar signs and symptoms have been documented in several patients with PSD. The diagnosis is made by either a swab of the affected region submitted for microbiological analysis with the specific question for GABHS, or a rapid <e>strep</e> test. Systemic antibiotics such as penicillin, erythromycin, newer macrolides, or others, probably augmented by topical antiseptic or antibiotic ointments are the treatment of choice. Treatment duration should be at least 14 days or, even better, 21 days, and be dictated by clinical and microbiological cure. Therefore treatment success should be investigated not only by clinical examination but also by post-treatment perineal swabs as well as a urine analysis to monitor for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. The author of this review supports the recent suggestion to summarize GABHS-induced vulvovaginal and penile infections together with PSD under the inclusive term 'perineal streptococcal disease' because these conditions coincide, share important clinical characteristics and, therefore, represent manifestations of the same disease.",M2

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective multicenter study including three Danish paediatric hospital departments was performed from May 1, 1998 to April 30, 1999. In 353 children aged 0-14 years the result of the ADT, Clearview <e>Strep</e> A, was compared with the result obtained with cultivation in an aerobic culture and the clinical parameters: hyperaemia, swelling, coating, adenitis and a temperature &gt; or = 38.5 degrees C. In 126 patients the results of the ADT were also compared with white blood cell count (WBC), neutrofil count (NC) and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: The prevalence of Group A Streptococci (GAS) from culture was 15%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of ADT were 67%, 95%, 72% and 94%, respectively. The positive predictive value of the ADT was significantly lower in patients aged 0-4 years than in patients aged &gt; or = 5 years (p = 0.02). The prevalence of positive ADT was significantly higher in patients with heavy growth of GAS than in patients with moderate or sparse growth (p = 0.01). The prevalence of adenitis (p = 0.003) and coating (p = 0.003) was significantly raised in ADT-positive patients. In patients with growth of Group A Streptococci in cultivation in an aerobic culture the prevalence of adenitis (p = 0.006) and elevated CRP (p = 0.03) was significantly raised. DISCUSSION: The sensitivity of 67% for the ADT is not satisfactory. However, in our opinion, this is not a sufficient argument against using ADT. It was a problem that the result of the ADT was sometimes difficult to read. Adjustment of the test procedure and the use of easy readable and high-sensitive optical immunoassay tests would probably improve the results significantly. Until the results of such studies exist, we suggest that the method of cultivation in an aerobic culture is used in the case of negative ADT, at least in patients with pronounced symptoms and/or clinical signs of streptococcal tonsilitis (adenitis and coating).",M2

12777583,"Evaluating the American Academy of Pediatrics diagnostic standard for Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis: backup culture versus repeat rapid antigen testing.OBJECTIVE: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all negative rapid diagnostic tests for Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis be backed up by culture, which creates a dilemma for clinicians who must make treatment decisions without complete diagnostic information at the time of visit. The use of a follow-up serial rapid antigen test instead of a follow-up culture would provide a more timely result. METHODS: Two swabs were collected from children who were suspected of having S pyogenes pharyngitis. Each swab was used for a culture and an OSOM Ultra <e>Strep</e> A Test rapid antigen test. The gold standard of comparison was defined as the identification of S pyogenes on either of the 2 culture plates. Three diagnostic strategies were evaluated: a single rapid antigen test, a rapid antigen test with follow-up rapid antigen test (rapid-rapid), and a rapid antigen test with follow-up culture (rapid-culture). RESULTS: A total of 210 (23.7%) of 887 throat cultures with matched data were identified with S pyogenes. A single rapid antigen test had a sensitivity of 87.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83.2%-92.1%), the sensitivity of the rapid-rapid follow-up was 91.4% (95% CI: 87.6%-95.2%), and the sensitivity of the rapid-culture follow-up was 95.7% (95% CI: 93.0%-98.5%), which was significantly higher than the others. As shown in Fig 1, when these test strategies were evaluated on a subgroup with clinical symptoms commonly associated with S pyogenes pharyngitis, the sensitivities all increased and were no longer significantly different. None of the strategies reliably exceeded a 95% sensitivity threshold. CONCLUSIONS: The American Academy of Pediatrics strategy for S pyogenes detection in children with pharyngitis, requiring a backup culture for those with negative antigen tests, was not exceeded by any other test strategy; however, a rapid-rapid diagnostic strategy may approximate it with the use of judicious clinical selection of patients.",M2

The LightCycler PCR produced more positive results (n = 58) than either culture (n = 55) or the Directigen immunoassay (n = 31). The results of the LightCycler PCR and the Directigen method were independently compared to the results of the accepted  gold standard,  bacterial culture. The sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values for this comparison were as follows: for the Directigen method, 55, 99, 97, and 93%, respectively; for the LightCycler PCR, 93, 98, 88, and 99%, respectively. In no case was a throat swab positive by both the LightCycler PCR and the Directigen method but negative by culture. The medical histories of patients whose throat swabs were negative by culture but positive by either the LightCycler PCR (n = 7) or the Directigen method (n = 1) were reviewed. All of these patients had signs or symptoms compatible with GAS disease, and therefore, all of these discordant positive results (along with positive results by either the Directigen method or the LightCycler PCR that agreed with the culture results) were counted as true positives for statistical analysis. For this analysis, the LightCycler PCR detected more true-positive results than the culture method (58 versus 55 swabs); however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.5465). In contrast, statistically significantly more true-positive results occurred by culture than by the Directigen method (55 versus 31 swabs; P &lt; 0.0001) and by the LightCycler PCR than by the Directigen method (58 versus 31 swabs; P &lt; 0.0001). The LightCycler PCR is a suitable stand-alone method for the detection of GAS from throat swabs. Additionally, this method requires less than half the personnel time and the procedure can be completed in considerably less time ( approximately 1 h) than our standard approach (up to 2 days) for detection of GAS in throat swabs (i.e., testing by the Directigen method with negative results verified by culture).",M2

Frequent use of antibiotics during childhood might be a factor underlying the rising severity and prevalence of asthma and other allergic disorders. The objective of the study was to determine if pediatric patients with asthma or allergic rhinitis have an altered rate of group A beta hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) tonsillopharyngeal infection which might support any change in guidelines for antibiotic prescription. A prospective analysis of all patients presenting a clinical feature of GABHS pharyngitis with a sore throat in two pediatric clinics located in Detroit, MI, USA and San Antonio de Areco, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Eligible patients aged between 2 and 18 years were screened for the presence of asthma and/or allergic rhinitis and administered a test (rapid <e>strep</e> test) and throat culture to determine GABHS infection. At the Redford Medical Center, Detroit, 500 patients met the eligibility criteria, with 168 (33.6%) having a positive strep test.

In response to a report by a manufacturer that the background RLU values for the Copan rayon swabs with liquid media were higher than the RLU values typically observed with Culturette swabs, we tested multiple lots of Copan rayon swabs with liquid media and determined that the swabs are unacceptable for routine use in the GASDT. The high background RLU values for the Copan rayon swabs appear to be a direct result of the gamma irradiation used to sterilize the swabs. We also performed a comparative clinical evaluation of Copan Dacron swabs with liquid media and Culturette swabs for use in the GASDT. Overall, there was 97.5% agreement between the results obtained with the Copan Dacron swabs and those obtained with the Culturette swabs. Compared to Culturette swabs, the Copan Dacron swabs had a sensitivity and a specificity of 97 and 98%, respectively. Copan Dacron swabs with liquid media are an acceptable alternative to the swabs currently qualified for use with the GASDT, but Copan rayon swabs with liquid transport media should not be used in the GASDT.",M2
