20606150,"Tight blood pressure control and cardiovascular outcomes among hypertensive patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease.CONTEXT: Hypertension guidelines advocate treating systolic blood pressure (BP) to less than 130 mm Hg for patients with diabetes mellitus; however, data are lacking for the growing population who also have coronary artery disease (CAD). OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of systolic BP control achieved and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in a cohort of patients with diabetes and CAD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Observational subgroup analysis of 6400 of the 22,576 participants in the International Verapamil SR-Trandolapril Study (INVEST). For this analysis, participants were at least 50 years old and had diabetes and CAD. Participants were recruited between September 1997 and December 2000 from 862 sites in 14 countries and were followed up through March 2003 with an extended follow-up through August 2008 through the National Death Index for <e>US</e> participants. INTERVENTION: Patients received first-line treatment of either a calcium antagonist or beta-blocker followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a diuretic, or both to achieve systolic BP of less than 130 and diastolic BP of less than 85 mm Hg. Patients were categorized as having tight control if they could maintain their systolic BP at less than 130 mm Hg; usual control if it ranged from 130 mm Hg to less than 140 mm Hg; and uncontrolled if it was 140 mm Hg or higher. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including the primary outcomes which was the first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. RESULTS: During 16,893 patient-years of follow-up, 286 patients (12.7%) who maintained tight control, 249 (12.6%) who had usual control, and 431 (19.8%) who had uncontrolled systolic BP experienced a primary outcome event. Patients in the usual-control group had a cardiovascular event rate of 12.6% vs a 19.8% event rate for those in the uncontrolled group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-1.71; P &lt; .001). However, little difference existed between those with usual control and those with tight control. Their respective event rates were 12.6% vs 12.7% (adjusted HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.93-1.32; P = .24). The all-cause mortality rate was 11.0% in the tight-control group vs 10.2% in the usual-control group (adjusted HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.99-1.45; P = .06); however, when extended follow-up was included, risk of all-cause mortality was 22.8% in the tight control vs 21.8% in the usual control group (adjusted HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.32; P = .04). CONCLUSION: Tight control of systolic BP among patients with diabetes and CAD was not associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes compared with usual control.

20606149,"Survival differences following lung transplantation among <e>US</e> transplant centers.CONTEXT: Although case loads vary substantially among US lung transplant centers, the impact of center effects on patient outcomes following lung transplantation is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess variability in long-term survival following lung transplantation among US lung transplant centers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Analysis of data from the United Network for Organ Sharing registry for 15,642 adult patients undergoing lung transplantation between 1987 and 2009 in 61 US transplantation centers still active in 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mixed-effect Cox models were fitted to assess survival following lung transplantation at individual centers. RESULTS: In 2008, 19 centers (31.1%) performed between 1 and 10 lung transplantations; 18 centers (29.5%), from 11 to 25 transplantations; 20 centers (32.8%), from 26 to 50 transplantations; and 4 centers (6.6%), more than 50 transplantations. One-month, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates among all 61 centers were 93.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.0% to 93.8%), 79.7% (95% CI, 79.1% to 80.4%), 63.0% (95% CI, 62.2% to 63.8%), and 49.5% (95% CI, 48.6% to 50.5%), respectively. Characteristics of donors, recipients, and surgical techniques varied substantially among centers. After adjustment for these factors, marked variability remained among centers, with hazard ratios for death ranging from 0.70 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.82) to 1.71 (95% CI, 1.36 to 2.14) for low- vs high-risk centers, for 5-year survival rates of 30.0% to 61.1%. Higher lung transplantation volumes were associated with improved long-term survival and accounted for 15% of among-center variability; however, variability in center performance remained significant after controlling for procedural volume (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Center-specific variation in survival following lung transplantation was only partly associated with procedural volume. However, other statistically significant sources of variability remain to be identified.",M1

20595532,"Two countries divided by a common language: health systems in the UK and USA.Despite the historic significance of the healthcare reform bill that was passed into law by President Obama in March 2010, the debate still rages. The UK National Health Service (NHS) has featured prominently in the current American debate on healthcare reform, with critics calling attention to its perceived shortcomings. Some of these, such as the existence of 'death panels', can easily be dismissed, but others, such as the cancer survival deficit, cannot. This paper reviews the evidence on outcomes from cancer and other chronic non-communicable diseases, the two leading causes of death in both countries. The headline figures showing better cancer survival in the USA are exaggerated by methodological issues, but a gap remains, due in large part to better outcomes among older people. Outcomes among younger people with chronic disease are, however, much worse in the USA. Paradoxically, given the nature of the debate in the USA so far, those parts of the <e>US</e> health system that get the best results, such as the Veterans' Administration, or the elderly on Medicare, are those that most closely resemble the British NHS - but which are funded somewhat more generously.",M1

20578557,"Impact on access to medicines from TRIPS-Plus: a case study of Thai-<e>US</e> FTA.This study assessed the impact of the Thai-US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on access to medicines in Thailand. We first interpreted the text of the sixth round of Thai-US negotiations in 2006 on intellectual property rights (IPR). The impact was estimated using a macroeconomic model of the impact of changes in IPR. The estimated impact is based on a comparison between the current IPR situation and the proposed changes to IPR. The FTA text involves the period of patent extension from the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS Agreement). The provisions involve the period of patent extension, which have to do with compensation for delays in patent registration and/or drug registration, data exclusivity that would result in a delay in generic drug entry, and the enforcing role of the Thai Food and Drug Administration of patent linkages. As a worst case scenario for this single provision, a 10 year patent extension would be given to compensate for delays in patent registration and/or drug registration. The impact on access to medicine, in the year 2027, would be: 1) A 32% increase in the medicine price index, 2) spending on medicines would increase to approximately USD 11,191 million, (USD1 = THB 33.9 on September 2, 2009), and 3) the domestic industry could loss USD 3.3 million. These results suggest there would be a severe restriction on the access to medicines under the TRIPS-Plus proposal. IPR protection of pharmaceuticals per the TRIPS-Plus proposal should be excluded from FTA negotiations.",M1
20575212,"Preferences for labor and delivery practices between pregnant immigrants and U.S.-born patients: a comparative prospective antenatal survey study.OBJECTIVE: To compare preferences in pregnant Somali and Sudanese immigrants with <e>US</e>-born women for different labor and delivery procedures and practices. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women who received prenatal care services at the Jericho Road Family Practice were surveyed. Ninety-three consecutive patients agreed to participate. A translator-facilitated questionnaire was administered to Somali-, Sudanese-, and U.S.-born women during antenatal visits. RESULTS: For pain relief in labor, 66.7% of U.S.-born, 64.0% of Somali, and 12.5% of Sudanese women preferred epidural analgesia (p = .002). More U.S.-born women preferred for the umbilical cord to be cut by their partners (76.2%) vs. Somali (6.7%) and Sudanese (0%) (p &lt; .001). For infant feeding, more U.S.-born women (47%) preferred only formula feeding (Somali, 3.4%; Sudanese, 0%; p &lt; .001). Responses were not statistically different for other preference questions, such as mobility/position in labor, attendants in labor, and duration of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective survey quantifies the differences in preferences for labor and delivery practices from two foreign populations and from U.S.-born women. This information is useful for all physicians who wish to better meet the needs of individual patients, especially those who are from different cultures and backgrounds.",M1

20571016,"Infection rate and acute organ dysfunction risk as explanations for racial differences in severe sepsis.CONTEXT: Severe sepsis, defined as infection complicated by acute organ dysfunction, occurs more frequently and leads to more deaths in black than in white individuals. The optimal approach to minimize these disparities is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which higher severe sepsis rates in black than in white patients are due to higher infection rates or to a higher risk of acute organ dysfunction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of infection-related hospitalizations from the 2005 hospital discharge data of 7 <e>US</e> states and infection-related emergency department visits from the 2003-2007 National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Age- and sex-standardized severe sepsis and infection hospitalization rates and the risk of acute organ dysfunction. RESULTS: Of 8,661,227 non-childbirth-related discharges, 2,261,857 were associated with an infection, and of these, 381,787 (16.8%) had severe sepsis. Black patients had a 67% higher age- and sex-standardized severe sepsis rate than did white patients (9.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.3-9.5 vs 5.6; 95% CI, 5.6-5.6 per 1000 population; P &lt; .001) and 80% higher standardized mortality (1.8, 95% CI, 1.8-1.9 vs 1.0, 95% CI, 1.0-1.1 per 1000 population; P &lt; .001). The higher severe sepsis rate was explained by both a higher infection rate in black patients (47.3; 95% CI, 47.1-47.4 vs 34.0; 95% CI, 33.9-34.0 per 1000 population; incidence rate ratio, 1.39; P &lt; .001) and a higher risk of developing acute organ dysfunction (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.29; 95% CI, 1.27-1.30; P &lt; .001). Differences in infection presented broadly across different sites and etiology of infection and for community- and hospital-acquired infections and occurred despite a lower likelihood of being admitted for infection from the emergency department (adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64-0.76; P &lt; .001). The higher risk of organ dysfunction persisted but was attenuated after adjusting for age, sex, comorbid conditions, poverty, and hospital effect (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.16; P &lt; .001). Racial disparities in infection and severe sepsis incidence and mortality rates were largest among younger adults (eg, the proportion of invasive pneumococcal disease occurring in adults &lt; 65 years was 73.9% among black patients vs 44.5% among white patients, P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: Racial differences in severe sepsis are explained by both a higher infection rate and a higher risk of acute organ dysfunction in black than in white individuals.",M1

20569735,"Fibromyalgia syndrome: practical strategies for improving diagnosis and patient outcomes.Recent advances in the understanding of the etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fibromyalgia must be applied in clinical practice to achieve optimal patient outcomes. Current evidence indicates that fibromyalgia is a hyperalgesic state, resulting from a generalized problem with augmented pain processing that likely results from the way the spinal cord and the brain process pain and other sensory information. The descending pain pathway involving serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, as opposed to the descending opioid pain pathway, appears to be selectively attenuated. Newer treatment options targeted at the pain mechanisms include the alpha(2)-delta pregabalin, which binds to the alpha(2)-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in neurons, and the serotonin-norepinephrine dual reuptake inhibitors duloxetine and milnacipran. The <e>US</e> Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran for the management of fibromyalgia. In addition to pharmacologic therapy, patient education, cognitive behavioral therapy, aerobic exercise, and strength and flexibility training are important components of care. An individualized treatment plan should be developed with consideration of each patient's unique combination of fibromyalgia symptoms, functional level, and the presence of the comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions that are common in patients with fibromyalgia. This educational activity provides clinicians with the tools necessary to differentiate fibromyalgia syndrome from other chronic pain conditions through a review of recent clinical data and an application of an advanced understanding of pain pathways. Strategies to manage patients with comorbid conditions are explored, with an emphasis on the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to patient care.

20562188,"Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and the risk of rarer cancers: Design and methods of the Cohort Consortium Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rarer Cancers.The Cohort Consortium Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rarer Cancers (VDPP), a consortium of 10 prospective cohort studies from the United States, Finland, and China, was formed to examine the associations between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations and the risk of rarer cancers. Cases (total n = 5,491) included incident primary endometrial (n = 830), kidney (n = 775), ovarian (n = 516), pancreatic (n = 952), and upper gastrointestinal tract (n = 1,065) cancers and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1,353) diagnosed in the participating cohorts. At least 1 control was matched to each case on age, date of blood collection (1974-2006), sex, and race/ethnicity (n = 6,714). Covariate data were obtained from each cohort in a standardized manner. The majority of the serum or plasma samples were assayed in a central laboratory using a direct, competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay on the DiaSorin LIAISON platform (DiaSorin, Inc., Stillwater, Minnesota). Masked quality control samples included serum standards from the <e>US</e> National Institute of Standards and Technology. Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted using clinically defined cutpoints, with 50-&lt;75 nmol/L as the reference category. Meta-analyses were also conducted using inverse-variance weights in random-effects models.

20560289,"Fatigue in sarcoidosis: American versus Dutch patients.BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a major problem in sarcoidosis. Fatigue has mainly been examined in patients from The Netherlands. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to establish the prevalence of fatigue in <e>US</e> and Dutch patients and to determine whether fatigue was related to the common demographic and clinical parameters. DESIGN: Two patients groups were studied: Dutch outpatients at Maastricht University Medical Center in The Netherlands (n = 121) and US patients at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center in the USA (n = 126). Both groups completed the Fatigue Assessment Scale. Clinical data were gathered from the patients' medical files. RESULTS: The prevalence of fatigue was similar in the US and Dutch patients, but more severe in the latter group. Fatigue was unrelated to demographic and clinical parameters in the total group. However, when examining the US and Dutch patients separately, fatigue was associated with age, extrapulmonary involvement and drug use in the US group. CONCLUSIONS: Dutch patients report more severe fatigue compared with US patients. Interestingly, fatigue was related to clinical and demographical parameters in the US patients, although no such relationships was found in the Dutch patients.",M1

20551406,"Association of corticosteroid dose and route of administration with risk of treatment failure in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.CONTEXT: Systemic corticosteroids are beneficial for patients hospitalized with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, their optimal dose and route of administration are uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of patients treated with low doses of steroids administered orally to those treated with higher doses administered intravenously. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A pharmacoepidemiological cohort study conducted at 414 <e>US</e> hospitals involving patients admitted with acute exacerbation of COPD in 2006 and 2007 to a non-intensive care setting and who received systemic corticosteroids during the first 2 hospital days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A composite measure of treatment failure, defined as the initiation of mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day, inpatient mortality, or readmission for acute exacerbation of COPD within 30 days of discharge. Length of stay and hospital costs. RESULTS: Of 79,985 patients, 73,765 (92%) were initially treated with intravenous steroids, whereas 6220 (8%) received oral treatment. We found that 1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3%-1.5%) of the intravenously and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.7%-1.2%) of the orally treated patients died during hospitalization, whereas 10.9% (95% CI, 10.7%-11.1%) of the intravenously and 10.3% (95% CI, 9.5%-11.0%) of the orally treated patients experienced the composite outcome. After multivariable adjustment, including the propensity for oral treatment, the risk of treatment failure among patients treated orally was not worse than for those treated intravenously (odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84-1.02). In a propensity-matched analysis, the risk of treatment failure was significantly lower among orally treated patients (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.95), as was length of stay and cost. Using an adaptation of the instrumental variable approach, increased rate of treatment with oral steroids was not associated with a change in the risk of treatment failure (OR for each 10% increase in hospital use of oral steroids, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.03). A total of 1356 (22%) patients initially treated with oral steroids were switched to intravenous therapy later in the hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Among patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD low-dose steroids administered orally are not associated with worse outcomes than high-dose intravenous therapy.",M1
20548011,"Cervical cancer screening with both human papillomavirus and Papanicolaou testing vs Papanicolaou testing alone: what screening intervals are physicians recommending?BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend screening for cervical cancer among women 30 years or older 3 years after a normal Papanicolaou test (hereinafter referred to as Pap test) result or a combined normal screening result (normal Pap/negative human papillomavirus [HPV] test results). We assessed reported recommendations by <e>US</e> primary care physicians (PCPs) on screening intervals that incorporate HPV cotesting compared with Pap testing alone. METHODS: From September 1, 2006, through May 31, 2007, we conducted a mailed survey of a representative sample of 1212 PCPs, of whom 950 performed Pap tests and recommended the HPV test for screening or management. The main outcome measure included self-reported data on timing of screening intervals for women with normal results using clinical vignettes. RESULTS: Among Pap test providers who recommend HPV testing, 31.8% reported that they would conduct the next Pap test in 3 years for a 35-year-old woman with 3 normal Pap test results. For a 35-year-old woman with a normal Pap test result and a negative HPV test finding, only 19.0% would conduct the next Pap test in 3 years. Most remaining physicians would conduct the Pap test more frequently. Most PCPs did not recommend a second HPV test or recommended the next HPV test at the same frequency as the Pap test. Physician specialty was strongly associated with guideline-consistent recommendations for the next Pap or HPV test. CONCLUSIONS: A lower proportion of PCPs recommend extending screening intervals to 3 years with an HPV cotest than those screening with the Pap test alone. Implementation of effective interventions and strategies that improve physician adherence to recommendations will be important for efficient screening practices.",M1
20548009,"White rice, brown rice, and risk of type 2 diabetes in <e>US</e> men and women.BACKGROUND: Because of differences in processing and nutrients, brown rice and white rice may have different effects on risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We examined white and brown rice consumption in relation to type 2 diabetes risk prospectively in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses' Health Study I and II. METHODS: We prospectively ascertained and updated diet, lifestyle practices, and disease status among 39,765 men and 157,463 women in these cohorts. RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment for age and other lifestyle and dietary risk factors, higher intake of white rice (&gt; or =5 servings per week vs &lt;1 per month) was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes: pooled relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]), 1.17 (1.02-1.36). In contrast, high brown rice intake (&gt; or =2 servings per week vs &lt;1 per month) was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes: pooled relative risk, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.81-0.97). We estimated that replacing 50 g/d (uncooked, equivalent to one-third serving per day) intake of white rice with the same amount of brown rice was associated with a 16% (95% CI, 9%-21%) lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas the same replacement with whole grains as a group was associated with a 36% (30%-42%) lower diabetes risk. CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of whole grains, including brown rice, for white rice may lower risk of type 2 diabetes. These data support the recommendation that most carbohydrate intake should come from whole grains rather than refined grains to help prevent type 2 diabetes.",M1
20548006,"Free clinics in the United States: a nationwide survey.BACKGROUND: Since an increasing proportion of the <e>US</e> population is without health insurance, a network of free clinics has gradually developed to provide care for the uninsured. Despite widespread concern about the uninsured and the viability of the safety net, free clinics have been overlooked and poorly studied, leaving old assumptions and beliefs largely unchallenged. As a result, policy discussions have been forestalled and potentially fruitful collaborations between free clinics and other safety net providers have been hindered. The objective of this study is to describe the attributes of free clinics and measure their contribution to the safety net. METHODS: National mail survey of all known free clinics in the United States. The main outcome measures were organizational structures, operations, revenue sources, patient profiles, services, and staffing. RESULTS: The study represents the first census of free clinics in 40 years and garnered a 75.9% response rate. Overall, 1007 free clinics operated in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Annually, these clinics provided care for 1.8 million individuals, accounting for 3.5 million medical and dental visits. The mean operating budget was $287,810. Overall, 58.7% received no government revenue. Clinics were open a mean of 18 hours per week and generally provided chronic disease management (73.2%), physical examinations (81.4%), urgent/acute care (62.3%), and medications (86.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Free clinics operate largely outside of the safety net system. However, they have become an established and meaningful contributor to it. Policymakers should consider integrating the free clinic network with other safety net providers or providing direct financial support.",M1
20547952,"Healthy diets and the subsequent prevalence of nuclear cataract in women.OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between healthy diet scores and prevalence of nuclear cataract in women. METHODS: The association between healthy diet scores, which reflect adherence to the <e>US</e> dietary guidelines, and prevalence of nuclear cataract determined 4 to 7 years later was assessed in a sample of Women's Health Initiative Observational Study participants (aged 50-79 years) residing in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Oregon. Scores on the 1995 Healthy Eating Index, which reflect adherence to 1990 guidelines, were assigned from responses to food frequency questionnaires at the Women's Health Initiative baseline (1994-1998). Presence of nuclear cataract was determined from slitlamp photographs and self-reports of cataract extractions were assessed from May 1, 2001, to January 31, 2004, in 1808 women participating in the Carotenoids in Age-Related Eye Disease Study. RESULTS: Having a high 1995 Healthy Eating Index score was the strongest modifiable predictor of low prevalence of nuclear cataract among numerous risk factors investigated in this sample. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for high vs low quintile for diet score was 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.91). Higher prevalence of nuclear cataract was also associated with other modifiable factors (smoking and marked obesity) and nonmodifiable factors (having brown eyes, myopia, and high pulse pressure). Vitamin supplement use was not related to cataract. CONCLUSION: These data add to the body of evidence suggesting that eating foods rich in a variety of vitamins and minerals may contribute to postponing the occurrence of the most common type of cataract in the United States.",M1
20547574,"Generalizing evidence from randomized clinical trials to target populations: The ACTG 320 trial.Properly planned and conducted randomized clinical trials remain susceptible to a lack of external validity. The authors illustrate a model-based method to standardize observed trial results to a specified target population using a seminal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment trial, and they provide Monte Carlo simulation evidence supporting the method. The example trial enrolled 1,156 HIV-infected adult men and women in the United States in 1996, randomly assigned 577 to a highly active antiretroviral therapy and 579 to a largely ineffective combination therapy, and followed participants for 52 weeks. The target population was <e>US</e> people infected with HIV in 2006, as estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results from the trial apply, albeit muted by 12%, to the target population, under the assumption that the authors have measured and correctly modeled the determinants of selection that reflect heterogeneity in the treatment effect. In simulations with a heterogeneous treatment effect, a conventional intent-to-treat estimate was biased with poor confidence limit coverage, but the proposed estimate was largely unbiased with appropriate confidence limit coverage. The proposed method standardizes observed trial results to a specified target population and thereby provides information regarding the generalizability of trial results.",M1

20544567,"Graduated licensing laws and fatal crashes of teenage drivers: a national study.OBJECTIVES: The objective of the current study was to quantify the effects of the strength of <e>US</e> state graduated driver licensing laws and specific licensing components on the rate of teenage driver fatal crash involvements per 100,000 teenagers during 1996-2007. The strengths of state laws were rated good, fair, marginal, or poor based on a system developed previously by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. METHODS: Analysis was based on quarterly counts of drivers involved in fatal crashes. Associations of overall ratings and individual licensing components with teenage crash rates were evaluated using Poisson regression, with the corresponding fatal crash rate for drivers ages 30-59 controlling for state- or time-dependent influences on crash rates unrelated to graduated licensing laws. RESULTS: Compared with licensing laws rated poor, laws rated good were associated with 30 percent lower fatal crash rates among 15- to 17-year-olds. Laws rated fair yielded fatal crash rates 11 percent lower. The longer the permit age was delayed, or the longer the licensing age was delayed, the lower the estimated fatal crash rates among 15- to 17-year-olds. Stronger nighttime restrictions were associated with larger reductions, and reductions were larger for laws limiting teenage passengers to zero or one than laws allowing two or more teenage passengers or laws without passenger restrictions. After the effects of any related delay in licensure were accounted for, an increase in the minimum learner's permit holding period showed no association with fatal crash rates. An increase in required practice driving hours did not appear to have an independent association with fatal crash rates. CONCLUSIONS: Graduated licensing laws that include strong nighttime and passenger restrictions and laws that delay the learner's permit age and licensing age are associated with lower teenage fatal crash rates. States that adopt such laws can expect to achieve substantial reductions in crash deaths.",M1
20538117,"Difference in patient profiles and outcomes in Japanese versus American patients undergoing coronary revascularization (collaborative study by CREDO-Kyoto and the Texas Heart Institute Research Database).Although coronary revascularization is common in both Japan and the United States (<e>US</e>), no direct comparison has been performed to demonstrate differences in the clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes of patients in these 2 countries. We analyzed the preprocedural, in-hospital, and long-term data from the Coronary Revascularization Demonstrating Outcome registry (Kyoto, Japan) and the Texas Heart Institute Research Database (Houston, Texas) of 16,100 patients who had undergone elective, initial percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. The Japanese procedures were performed from 2000 to 2002 (n = 8,871, follow-up period 3.5 years, interquartile range 2.6 to 4.3) and the US procedures from 1999 to 2003 (n = 7,229, follow-up period 5.2 years, interquartile range 3.8 to 6.5). The Japanese patients tended to be older (mean age 67.2 vs 62.7 years; p &lt;0.001), to smoke (52.9% vs 46.0%; p &lt;0.001), and to have diabetes (39.2% vs 31.0%; p &lt;0.001) and stroke (16.4% vs 5.0%; p &lt;0.001). The US patients were more obese (body mass index 23.7 vs 29.3 kg/m(2); p &lt;0.001), with greater rates of systemic atherosclerotic disease. Both groups had a similar in-hospital mortality rate (Japanese patients 0.9% vs US patients 1.1%; p = 0.19) and crude long-term mortality rate (Japanese patients 27.7/1,000 person-years, US patients 28.2/1,000 person-years; p = 0.35). After adjustment for known predictors, the US group had greater long-term mortality than the Japanese group (hazard ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.50 to 1.95; p &lt;0.001). This finding was consistent among all high-risk subgroups. In conclusion, the 2 registries showed similar crude outcomes but important differences in patient risk factors such as obesity. In the adjusted analysis, the Japanese patients had better outcomes than did the US patients. Additional study is needed to assess the effect of ethnic and risk factor variations on coronary artery disease.",M1
20538111,"Vital exhaustion as a risk factor for adverse cardiac events (from the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities [ARIC] study).Vital exhaustion, defined as excessive fatigue, feelings of demoralization, and increased irritability, has been identified as a risk factor for incident and recurrent cardiac events, but there are no population-based prospective studies of this association in <e>US</e> samples. We examined the predictive value of vital exhaustion for incident myocardial infarction or fatal coronary heart disease in middle-aged men and women in 4 US communities. Participants were 12,895 black or white men and women enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study cohort and followed for the occurrence of cardiac morbidity and mortality from 1990 through 2002 (maximum follow-up 13.0 years). Vital exhaustion was assessed using the 21-item Maastricht Questionnaire and scores were partitioned into approximate quartiles for statistical analyses. High vital exhaustion (fourth quartile) predicted adverse cardiac events in age-, gender-, and race-center-adjusted analyses (1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 2.05) and in analyses further adjusted for educational level, body mass index, plasma low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking status, and pack-years of cigarette smoking (1.46, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.79). Risk for adverse cardiac events increased monotonically from the first through the fourth quartile of vital exhaustion. Probabilities of adverse cardiac events over time were significantly higher in people with high vital exhaustion compared to those with low exhaustion (p = 0.002). In conclusion, vital exhaustion predicts long-term risk for adverse cardiac events in men and women, independent of established biomedical risk factors.",M1

20533878,"The prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States in the era of vaccination.BACKGROUND: Our objective was to assess trends in the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the United States after widespread hepatitis B vaccination. METHODS: The prevalence of HBV infection and immunity was determined in a representative sample of the <e>US</e> population for the periods 1999-2006 and 1988-1994. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys participants 6 years of age were tested for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). Prevalence estimates were weighted and age-adjusted. RESULTS: During the period 1999-2006, age-adjusted prevalences of anti-HBc (4.7%) and HBsAg (0.27%) were not statistically different from what they were during 1988-1994 (5.4% and 0.38%, respectively). The prevalence of anti-HBc decreased among persons 6-19 years of age (from 1.9% to 0.6%; P &lt; .01) and 20-49 years of age (from 5.9% to 4.6%; P &lt; .01) but not among persons 50 years of age (7.2% vs 7.7%). During 1999-2006, the prevalence of anti-HBc was higher among non-Hispanic blacks (12.2%) and persons of  Other  race (13.3%) than it was among non-Hispanic whites (2.8%) or Mexican Americans (2.9%), and it was higher among foreign-born participants (12.2%) than it was among US-born participants (3.5%). Prevalence among US-born children 6-19 years of age (0.5%) did not differ by race or ethnicity. Disparities between US-born and foreign-born children were smaller during 1999-1996 (0.5% vs 2.0%) than during 1988-1994 (1.0% vs 12.8%). Among children 6-19 years of age, 56.7% had markers of vaccine-induced immunity. CONCLUSIONS: HBV prevalence decreased among US children, which reflected the impact of global and domestic vaccination, but it changed little among adults, and approximately 730,000 US residents (95% confidence interval, 550,000-940,000) are chronically infected.",M1
20531273,"Emergence of orphan drugs in the United States: a quantitative assessment of the first 25 years.The 1983 <e>US</e> Orphan Drug Act has stimulated the development of new therapies for rare diseases. To provide the first comprehensive overview of orphan-designated products and their indications, this article quantitatively analyses the characteristics and distribution of orphan designations and approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration from 1983 to August 2008. Of the 1,892 orphan-designated products, 326 received marketing approval, representing 247 different drugs and more than 200 different diseases. About half of the approvals had occurred by 4 years after designation was granted. The most common patient population size for orphan designations and approvals was fewer than 10,000 patients, and cancer was the most common disease area. The implications of such findings for future development and marketing of therapies for rare diseases are discussed.",M1
20531005,"Severe traumatic injury: regional variation in incidence and outcome.OBJECTIVES: The public health implications of regional variation in incidence and outcome of severe traumatic injury remain to be analyzed. The objective of this study was to determine whether the incidence and outcome associated with severe traumatic injury differs across geographic regions of North America. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium of all patients in 9 North American sites (6 <e>US</e> and 3 Canadian) sustaining severe traumatic injury from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2007 followed to hospital discharge. Eligible patients were assessed by organized emergency medical services, and had field-based physiologic criteria including systolic blood pressure &lt;or=90 mm Hg, Glasgow Coma Scale score &lt;or=12, respiratory rate &lt;10 or &gt;29 per minute, advanced airway procedure, or traumatic death in the field. Census data were used to determine rates adjusted for age and sex. The main outcome measures were incidence rate, mortality rate, case fatality rate, and survival to discharge for patients sustaining severe traumatic injury assessed by EMS. RESULTS: The total catchment population of 20.5 million yielded 7080 cases of severe traumatic injury. Median age was 36 years and 67% were male. The median incidence of EMS-assessed severe traumatic injury per 100,000 population across sites was 37.4 (interquartile range [IQR] = 24.6-69.6); survival ranged from 39.8% to 80.8%, with a median of 64.5% (IQR = 55.5-78.4). About 942 cases were pronounced dead at the scene and 5857 patients were transported to hospital; 4477 (63.2%) were discharged alive. The median incidence of severe trauma due to a blunt mechanism, transported to hospital, was 25.8 (IQR = 13.1-44.3); survival ranged from 52.6% to 87.3%, with a median of 78.0% (IQR = 68.4-83.5). The median incidence of severe penetrating trauma, transported to hospital, was 2.6 (IQR = 1.5-10.4); survival ranged from 37.5% to 84.7%, with a median of 67.5% (IQR = 54.1-75.9). All P values for differences across sites for incidence and survival were &lt;0.001. CONCLUSIONS: In this study involving 9 geographic regions in North America, there were significant and important regional differences in severe traumatic injury, incidence, and outcome. These differences were sustained for patients with either isolated blunt or penetrating injury mechanisms.",M1
20530974,"FDA review summary: Mozobil in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation.PURPOSE: On December 15, 2008, the <e>US</e> Food and Drug Administration approved plerixafor (Mozobil; Genzyme Corp.), a new small-molecule inhibitor of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, for use in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM). This summary reviews the database supporting this approval. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The safety and efficacy of plerixafor were demonstrated by 2 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled studies in patients with NHL and MM who were eligible for autologous HSC transplantation. The primary efficacy end points were the collection of &gt; or = 5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg from the peripheral blood in 4 or fewer apheresis sessions in patients with NHL or &gt; or = 6 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg from the peripheral blood in 2 or fewer apheresis sessions in patients with MM. RESULTS: The 2 randomized studies combined enrolled 600 patients (298 with NHL and 302 with MM). Fifty-nine percent of patients with NHL who were mobilized with G-CSF and plerixafor had peripheral blood HSC collections of &gt; or = 5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or fewer apheresis sessions, compared with 20% of patients with NHL who were mobilized with G-CSF and placebo (p &lt; 0.001). Seventy-two percent of patients with MM who were mobilized with Mozobil and G-CSF had peripheral blood HSC collections of &gt; or = 6 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg in 2 or fewer apheresis sessions, compared with 34% of patients with MM who were mobilized with placebo and G-CSF (p &lt; 0.001). Common adverse reactions included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, injection site reactions, fatigue, arthralgia, headache, dizziness, and insomnia.

20530781,"Infection control assessment of ambulatory surgical centers.CONTEXT: More than 5000 ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) in the United States participate in the Medicare program. Little is known about infection control practices in ASCs. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) piloted an infection control audit tool in a sample of ASC inspections to assess facility adherence to recommended practices. OBJECTIVE: To describe infection control practices in a sample of ASCs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: All State Survey Agencies were invited to participate. Seven states volunteered; 3 were selected based on geographic dispersion, number of ASCs each state committed to inspect, and relative cost per inspection. A stratified random sample of ASCs was selected from each state. Sample size was based on the number of inspections each state estimated it could complete between June and October 2008. Sixty-eight ASCs were assessed; 32 in Maryland, 16 in North Carolina, and 20 in Oklahoma. Surveyors from CMS, trained in use of the audit tool, assessed compliance with specific infection control practices. Assessments focused on 5 areas of infection control: hand hygiene, injection safety and medication handling, equipment reprocessing, environmental cleaning, and handling of blood glucose monitoring equipment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of facilities with lapses in each infection control category. RESULTS: Overall, 46 of 68 ASCs (67.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 55.9%-77.9%) had at least 1 lapse in infection control; 12 of 68 ASCs (17.6%; 95% CI, 9.9%-28.1%) had lapses identified in 3 or more of the 5 infection control categories. Common lapses included using single-dose medication vials for more than 1 patient (18/64; 28.1%; 95% CI, 18.2%-40.0%), failing to adhere to recommended practices regarding reprocessing of equipment (19/67; 28.4%; 95% CI, 18.6%-40.0%), and lapses in handling of blood glucose monitoring equipment (25/54; 46.3%; 95% CI, 33.4%-59.6%). CONCLUSION: Among a sample of <e>US</e> ASCs in 3 states, lapses in infection control were common.",M1

Methods: In the present study, data from 50 US states and the District of Columbia on malaria outbreaks in 1994, compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was analyzed in relation to state by state all cancer mortality data, 1950-94, from the National Cancer Institute. RESULTS: There was a significant association of malaria incidence with all cancer mortality in 50 US states and the District of Columbia. The association was independent of state population size, percentage black population by state, and median population age. CONCLUSION: The association between malaria and cancer mortality can be possibly explained by the well established ability of Plasmodium to induce suppression of the immune system. A second explanation may be that the anopheles mosquito, the vector of malaria, transmits an obscure virus that initially causes only a mild transitory illness but much later predisposes to cancer.",M1
20530011,"Prevalence of mental health problems and functional impairment among active component and National Guard soldiers 3 and 12 months following combat in Iraq.CONTEXT: A growing body of literature has demonstrated the association of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan with postdeployment mental health problems, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. However, studies have shown varying prevalence rates of these disorders based on different case definitions and have not assessed functional impairment, alcohol misuse, or aggressive behavior as comorbid factors occurring with PTSD and depression. OBJECTIVES: To (1) examine the prevalence rates of depression and PTSD using several case definitions including functional impairment, (2) determine the comorbidity of alcohol misuse or aggressive behaviors with depression or PTSD, and (3) compare rates between Active Component and National Guard soldiers at the 3- and 12-month time points following their deployment to Iraq. DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional study. SETTING: United States Army posts and National Guard armories. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 18 305 <e>US</e> Army soldiers from 4 Active Component and 2 National Guard infantry brigade combat teams. INTERVENTIONS: Between 2004 and 2007, anonymous mental health surveys were collected at 3 and 12 months following deployment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Current PTSD, depression, functional impairment, alcohol misuse, and aggressive behavior. RESULTS: Prevalence rates for PTSD or depression with serious functional impairment ranged between 8.5% and 14.0%, with some impairment between 23.2% and 31.1%. Alcohol misuse or aggressive behavior comorbidity was present in approximately half of the cases. Rates remained stable for the Active Component soldiers but increased across all case definitions from the 3- to 12-month time point for National Guard soldiers. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rates of PTSD and depression after returning from combat ranged from 9% to 31% depending on the level of functional impairment reported. The high comorbidity with alcohol misuse and aggression highlights the need for comprehensive postdeployment screening. Persistent or increased prevalence rates at 12 months compared with 3 months postdeployment illustrate the persistent effects of war zone service and provide important data to guide postdeployment care.",M1
20530010,"Posttraumatic stress disorder and risk of dementia among <e>US</e> veterans.CONTEXT: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent among US veterans because of combat and may impair cognition. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether PTSD is associated with the risk of developing dementia among older US veterans receiving treatment in the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. DESIGN: A stratified, retrospective cohort study conducted using the Department of Veterans Affairs National Patient Care Database. SETTING: Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 181 093 veterans 55 years or older without dementia from fiscal years 1997 through 2000 (53 155 veterans with and 127 938 veterans without PTSD). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: During the follow-up period between October 1, 2000, and December 31, 2007, 31 107 (17.2%) veterans were ascertained to have newly diagnosed dementia according to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. RESULTS: The mean baseline age of the veterans was 68.8 years, and 174 806 (96.5%) were men. Veterans with PTSD had a 7-year cumulative incident dementia rate of 10.6%, whereas those without had a rate of 6.6% (P &lt; .001). With age as the time scale, Cox proportional hazards models indicated that patients with PTSD were more than twice as likely to develop incident dementia compared with those without PTSD (hazard ratio, 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 2.24-2.39). After multivariable adjustment, patients with PTSD were still more likely to develop dementia (hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.70-1.85). Results were similar when we excluded those with a history of head injury, substance abuse, or clinical depression. CONCLUSIONS: In a predominantly male veteran cohort, those diagnosed as having PTSD were at a nearly 2-fold-higher risk of developing dementia compared with those without PTSD. Mechanisms linking these important disorders need to be identified with the hope of finding ways to reduce the increased risk of dementia associated with PTSD.",M1
20527322,"From road to lab to math: the co-evolution of technological, regulatory, and organizational innovations for automotive crash testing.Today, in the midst of economic crisis, senior executives at <e>US</e> automakers and influential industry analysts frequently reflect on the progression that safety testing has taken from the crude trials done on the road, to controlled laboratory experiments, and to today's complex math-based simulation models. They use stories of this seemingly linear and natural sequence to justify further investment in simulation technologies. The analysis presented in this paper shows that change in the structures of automakers' organizations co-evolved with regulations specifying who was at fault in vehicle impacts, how vehicles should be built to withstand the force of an impact, and how testing should be done to assure that vehicles met those requirements. Changes in the regulatory environment were bolstered by new theories about crash test dynamics and changing technologies with which to test those theories. Thus, as new technological and regulatory innovations co-evolved with innovations in organizational structuring, ideas about how to best conduct crash tests shifted and catalyzed new cycles of technological, regulatory, and organizational innovation. However, this co-evolutionary story tells us that the move from road to lab to math was not natural or linear as today's managerial rhetoric would have us believe. Rather, the logic of math-based simulation was the result of technological, regulatory and organizational changes that created an industry-wide ideology that supported the move toward math while making it appear natural within the shifting structure of the industry.",M1
20527321,"Negotiating exclusion: MSM, identity, and blood policy in the age of AIDS.In the <e>US</e>, blood donors face a variety of restrictions that leave many people excluded entirely from the donor pool. This paper explores the specific circumstances and meanings surrounding the donor ban on Men-who-have-Sex-with-Men (MSM). The ban on MSM is one of the few existing donor guidelines to receive considerable criticism on grounds that it effectively prohibits any sexually active gay man from donating blood and thus discriminates against gays. Due in part to these questions of fairness, the Blood Products Advisory Committee (BPAC) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) met to reconsider the decades-old policy, first in 1997 and again in 2000. The FDA asked its advisory committee to address the efficacy and utility of the MSM ban in light of technological developments in blood-banking, epidemiological data on the spread of HIV, and mounting pressures from gay rights and blood-banking organizations to update the policy. Through a detailed reading of meeting and conference transcripts that took place between 1997 and 2000, I argue that 'MSM' became a contested definitional category during the FDA's reappraisal of the policy. During and between the Committee's discussions, presenters and experts debated the differences between sexual behavior and sexual identity in relation to HIV and, eventually, HHV-8, a virus known to cause Kaposi's sarcoma in immunosuppressed individuals. I argue that the underlying flexibility in the meanings behind the term 'MSM' allowed Committee members, in the end, to retract their more nuanced discussions of human behavior and HIV and to uphold the contested policy. Finally, I suggest how the debates surrounding the MSM donor ban can help us to better understand the place of sexuality in discussions and claims of biopolitical citizenship in early 21st-century America.",M1

20520029,"Perspective: the revolution is upon <e>us</e>.Profound socioeconomic pressures on medical student education have been catalogued extensively. These pressures include teaching patient shortages, teacher shortages, conflicting systems, and financial problems. Many of these problems have been caused by an unregulated free market affecting medicine overall, with market values sometimes overshadowing the academic values of education, research, and patient care. This has caused profound changes in the conduct of medical student education. Particularly important has been a reduction in the  gold standard  of teaching: direct student-teacher and supervised student-patient interaction, replaced by a potpourri of online and simulated modules. The aggregate of these changes constitutes a revolution that challenges whether medical schools, school buildings, classes, and dedicated faculty are even necessary. The author posits several recommendations in response to this revolution: (1) recognize the revolution as such, and carefully guide or abort it, lest its outcome be inadequate, inauthentic, or corrupt, (2) prioritize academic rather than business values, (3) ensure that funds allotted for education are used for education, (4) insist that medical schools, not industry, teach students, (5) value authentic education more than simulation, (6) adopt learner-centered teaching without misusing it, (7) maintain acceptable class attendance without requiring it, (8) provide, from the first school day, authentic, patient-centered medical education characterized by vertical integration, humanism, early patient exposure, biopsychosocial orientation, and physician role modeling, (9) ensure that third- and fourth-year students have rich patient-care responsibility, and 10) keep tenure.

20518445,"The role, challenges, and support of pulsenet laboratories in detecting foodborne disease outbreaks.In recent years, there have been several high-profile nationwide foodborne outbreaks due to enteric organisms in food products, including Salmonella Typhimurium in peanut products, Salmonella Saintpaul in peppers, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in spinach. PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance, played a key role in detecting each of these outbreaks. PulseNet laboratories use bacterial subtyping methods to rapidly detect clusters of foodborne disease, which are often the first indication that an outbreak is occurring. Rapid outbreak detection reduces ongoing transmission through product recalls, restaurant closures, and other mechanisms. By greatly increasing the sensitivity of outbreak detection, PulseNet allows <e>us</e> to identify and correct problems with our food production and distribution systems that would not otherwise have come to our attention.

20516417,"Association between arterial hyperoxia following resuscitation from cardiac arrest and in-hospital mortality.CONTEXT: Laboratory investigations suggest that exposure to hyperoxia after resuscitation from cardiac arrest may worsen anoxic brain injury; however, clinical data are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that postresuscitation hyperoxia is associated with increased mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Multicenter cohort study using the Project IMPACT critical care database of intensive care units (ICUs) at 120 <e>US</e> hospitals between 2001 and 2005. Patient inclusion criteria were age older than 17 years, nontraumatic cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation within 24 hours prior to ICU arrival, and arterial blood gas analysis performed within 24 hours following ICU arrival. Patients were divided into 3 groups defined a priori based on PaO(2) on the first arterial blood gas values obtained in the ICU. Hyperoxia was defined as PaO(2) of 300 mm Hg or greater; hypoxia, PaO(2) of less than 60 mm Hg (or ratio of PaO(2) to fraction of inspired oxygen &lt;300); and normoxia, not classified as hyperoxia or hypoxia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: In-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 6326 patients, 1156 had hyperoxia (18%), 3999 had hypoxia (63%), and 1171 had normoxia (19%). The hyperoxia group had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (732/1156 [63%; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 60%-66%]) compared with the normoxia group (532/1171 [45%; 95% CI, 43%-48%]; proportion difference, 18% [95% CI, 14%-22%]) and the hypoxia group (2297/3999 [57%; 95% CI, 56%-59%]; proportion difference, 6% [95% CI, 3%-9%]). In a model controlling for potential confounders (eg, age, preadmission functional status, comorbid conditions, vital signs, and other physiological indices), hyperoxia exposure had an odds ratio for death of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.5-2.2). CONCLUSION: Among patients admitted to the ICU following resuscitation from cardiac arrest, arterial hyperoxia was independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality compared with either hypoxia or normoxia.",M1
20516416,"Association between use of bleeding avoidance strategies and risk of periprocedural bleeding among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.CONTEXT: Bleeding complications with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are associated with adverse patient outcomes. The association between the use of bleeding avoidance strategies and post-PCI bleeding as a function of a patient's preprocedural risk of bleeding is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of 2 bleeding avoidance strategies, vascular closure devices and bivalirudin, and associated post-PCI bleeding rates in a nationally representative PCI population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Analysis of data from 1,522,935 patients undergoing PCI procedures performed at 955 <e>US</e> hospitals participating in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) CathPCI Registry from January 1, 2004, through September 30, 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Periprocedural bleeding. RESULTS: Bleeding occurred in 30,654 patients (2%). Manual compression, vascular closure devices, bivalirudin, or vascular closure devices plus bivalirudin were used in 35%, 24%, 23%, and 18% of patients, respectively. Bleeding events were reported in 2.8% of patients who received manual compression, compared with 2.1%, 1.6%, and 0.9% of patients receiving vascular closure devices, bivalirudin, and both strategies, respectively (P &lt; .001). Bleeding rates differed by preprocedural risk assessed with the NCDR bleeding risk model (low risk, 0.72%; intermediate risk, 1.73%; high risk, 4.69%). In high-risk patients, use of both strategies was associated with lower bleeding rates (manual compression, 6.1%; vascular closure devices, 4.6%; bivalirudin, 3.8%; vascular closure devices plus bivalirudin, 2.3%; P &lt; .001). This association persisted following adjustment using a propensity-matched and site-controlled model. Use of both strategies was used least often in high-risk patients (14.4% vs 21.0% in low-risk patients, P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: In a large national PCI registry, vascular closure devices and bivalirudin were associated with significantly lower bleeding rates, particularly among patients at greatest risk for bleeding. However, these strategies were less often used among higher-risk patients.",M1

20515357,"An analysis of the differences in the acute hospitalization charges following minimally invasive versus open posterior lumbar interbody fusion.OBJECT: Minimally invasive spine (MIS) procedures are increasingly being recognized as equivalent to open procedures with regard to clinical and radiographic outcomes. These techniques are also believed to result in less pain and disability in the immediate postoperative period. There are, however, little data to assess whether these procedures produce their intended result and even fewer objective data to demonstrate that they are cost effective when compared with open surgery. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of hospital charges for 1- and 2-level MIS and open posterior interbody fusion for lumbar spondylotic disease, disc degeneration, and spondylolisthesis treated at a single academic medical center. Patients presenting with bilateral neurological symptoms were treated with open surgery, and those with unilateral symptoms were treated with MIS. Overall hospital charges and surgical episode-related charges, length of stay (LOS), and discharge status were obtained from the hospital finance department and adjusted for multi-/single-level surgeries. RESULTS: During a 14-month period, 74 patients (mean age 55 years) were treated. The series included 59 single-level operations (75% MIS and 25% open), and 15 2-level surgeries (53% MIS and 47% open). The demographic profile, including age and Charlson Comorbidity Index, were similar between the 4 groups. The mean LOS for patients undergoing single-level surgery was 3.9 and 4.8 days in the MIS and open cases, respectively (p = 0.017). For those undergoing 2-level surgery, the mean LOS was 5.1 for MIS versus 7.1 for open surgery (p = 0.259). With respect to hospital charges, single-level MIS procedures were associated with an average of $70,159 compared with $78,444 for open surgery (p = 0.027). For 2-level surgery, mean charges totalled $87,454 for MIS versus $108,843 for open surgery (p = 0.071). For single-level surgeries, 5 and 20% of patients undergoing MIS and open surgery, respectively, were discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. For 2-level surgeries, the rates were 13 and 29%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While hospital setting, treatment population, patient selection, and physician expectation play major roles in determining hospital charges and LOS, this pilot study at an academic teaching hospital shows trends for quicker discharge, reduced hospital charges, and lower transfer rates to inpatient rehabilitation with MIS. However, larger multicenter studies are necessary to validate these findings and their relevance across diverse <e>US</e> practice environments.",M1
20514070,"Voluntary exploratory data submissions to the <e>US</e> FDA and the EMA: experience and impact.Heterogeneity in the underlying mechanisms of disease processes and inter-patient variability in drug responses are major challenges in drug development. To address these challenges, biomarker strategies based on a range of platforms, such as microarray gene-expression technologies, are increasingly being applied to elucidate these sources of variability and thereby potentially increase drug development success rates. With the aim of enhancing understanding of the regulatory significance of such biomarker data by regulators and sponsors, the US Food and Drug Administration initiated a programme in 2004 to allow sponsors to submit exploratory genomic data voluntarily, without immediate regulatory impact. In this article, a selection of case studies from the first 5 years of this programme - which is now known as the voluntary exploratory data submission programme, and also involves collaboration with the European Medicines Agency - are discussed, and general lessons are highlighted.",M1
20510809,"International medical graduates in general surgery: increasing needs, decreasing numbers.BACKGROUND: The current residency training system in the United States (<e>US</e>) has inherent dependence on the international medical graduate (IMG). This article discusses the physician workforce shortage, especially related to general surgery, and examines the distribution of IMGs in general surgery ranks. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional study using the American Medical Association Masterfile database of physicians licensed to practice in at least 1 state and determined the number and location of general surgeons in practice. We then stratified the distribution of these practicing surgeons, both IMGs and non-IMGs, according to rural urban commuting areas into small rural, large rural, or urban areas. RESULTS: There were 17,727 general surgeons. IMGs were older (52 +/- 8 years versus 47 +/- 8 years; p &lt; 0.001), more likely to be male (93% versus 82%; p &lt; 0.001), and more likely to be further out of training (46% versus 28% &gt; or =20 years out of training; p &lt; 0.001). There were 2,216 IMGs in urban cores, constituting 15% of general surgeons in these areas. Large rural areas contained 223 IMGs (12% of general surgeons in these cores) and small rural areas contained 163 IMG general surgeons (16% of total general surgeons in these cores). CONCLUSIONS: General surgeons are in high demand, and until now have remained inherently dependent on IMGs to reinforce their ranks. Current numbers of IMGs in practice are declining. This decline, coupled with inadequate numbers of trainees in domestic general surgery programs, creates a crisis of urgency.",M1

In this article, some of the nurses who deployed to New York City in the aftermath of that horrific attack on the United States offer their recollections of the events. Although Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHS CC) officers participated in deployments before 9/11, this particular deployment accelerated the transformation of the PHS CC, because people came to realize the tremendous potential of a uniformed service of 6,000 health care professionals. When not responding to emergencies, PHS CC nurses daily serve the mission of the PHS to protect, promote, and advance the health and safety of the nation.

20509236,"Laboratories, museums, and the comparative perspective: Alan A. Boyden's quest for objectivity in serological taxonomy, 1924-1962.The rise of experimentation and the decline of natural history constitute the historiographic backbone to most narratives about the history of the life sciences in the twentieth century. As I argue here, however, natural history practices, such as the collection adn comparison of data from numerous species, adn experimental practices have actually converged throughout the century, giving rise to a new hybrid research culture which is essential to the contemporary life sciences. Looking at some examples of researchers who studied experimentally the relationships between organisms offers a unique window into how the norms, values, and practices of natural history entered the laboratory and, conversely, how the norms, values, and practices of experimentation transformed natural history. this paper concentrates on a largely overlooked episode in the history of the life sciences: the development of Alan A. Boyden's serological taxonomy. In the United States, from the late 1920s to the early 1960s, he was the most prominent advocate of this experimental approach in natural history. His quest for an objective method to understand the relationships among species, his creation of a serological museum where he could apply his comparative perspective, and his continued negotiations between natural historical and experimental traditions, illustrate the rise of a new hybrid research culture in the twentieth century. It also helps <e>us</e> solve a historiographic puzzle, namely how biological diversity become so central in the experimental life sciences, i.e., in a tradition which we generally understand as having focused on a few model organisms, and which relegated the study of biodiversity to naturalists and their museums.",M1

The purpose of this study was to determine if the sex disparity existed previously. METHODS: We assessed sex-specific stroke and vascular risk factor prevalence among individuals aged 35 to 64 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey conducted in 2 waves: 1988 to 1994 (n=7234) and 1999 to 2004 (n=6499). RESULTS: Women aged 35 to 54 years who participated in NHANES from 1999 to 2004 were 3 times more likely to have experienced a stroke compared with similarly aged women in NHANES 1988 to 1994 (1.8% versus 0.6%, P=0.003), but stroke prevalence among men did not change (0.9% versus 1.0%, nonsignificant). Among women, the prevalence of obesity (15.2% versus 17.9%, P=0.08), morbid obesity (12.8% versus 17.5%, P=0.003), abdominal obesity (47.4% versus 58.9%, P&lt;0.0001), hypertriglyceridemia (22.91% versus 26.78%, P=0.035), and hypertension (33.04% versus 37.43%, P=0.03) was lower in NHANES 1988 to 1994 compared with the more recent NHANES wave. Higher waist circumference was the only independent stroke risk factor for women aged 35 to 54 years in NHANES 1999 to 2004 (OR per 15-cm increase in waist circumference=1.02, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.04). CONCLUSIONS: Stroke prevalence among women aged 35 to 54 years has tripled over the past 2 decades, at the same time remaining stable among men. Prevalence of obesity and 3 metabolic syndrome components increased; they may be key factors in the increase in women's stroke prevalence.",M1

20503894,"Association between utilization of preventive services and health insurance status: findings from the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.OBJECTIVES: To describe the uninsured population in the United States, to determine factors of uninsurance and to test the association between insurance status and use of preventive care. METHODS: Using the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we conducted univariate logistic regression and stratified, multivariate and multinomial analyses, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Respondents aged &gt; or =65 years, regardless of their race/ethnicity, were much less likely to be uninsured than those aged 18 to 44 years. Lower annual income and unemployment were statistically significant factors of uninsurance for all racial/ethnic groups. Marital status was associated with lack of insurance, but only among non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks and those in the other racial/ethnic category. Those with health insurance were almost 4 to 8 times more likely to report having one of more individuals they thought of as their personal doctor or healthcare provider. Compared to the uninsured, the insured had greater odds of having a physical within the past year, across all racial/ethnic groups. The same finding was true for having a dental check-up within the past year, but only among non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: The access of preventive care such as routine physical and dental exams differs by health insurance status and among racial/ethnic groups. As the number of uninsured grows, the <e>US</e> healthcare system needs to determine sustainable ways to increase health insurance coverage and improve access to preventive care for this population.",M1
20503611,"Benchmarking electronic medical records initiatives in the <e>US</e>: a conceptual model.This article provides a conceptual model for benchmarking the use of clinical information systems within healthcare organizations. Additionally, it addresses the benefits of clinical information systems which include the reduction of errors, improvement in clinical decision-making and real time access to patient information. The literature suggests that clinical information systems provide financial benefits due to cost-savings from improved efficiency and reduction of errors. As a result, healthcare organizations should adopt such clinical information systems to improve quality of care and stay competitive in the marketplace. Our research clearly documents the increased adoption of electronic medical records in U.S. hospitals from 2005 to 2007. This is important because the electronic medical record provides an opportunity for integration of patient information and improvements in efficiency and quality of care across a wide range of patient populations. This was supported by recent federal initiatives such as the establishment of the Office of the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) to create an interoperable health information infrastructure. Potential barriers to the implementation of health information technology include cost, a lack of financial incentives for providers, and a need for interoperable systems. As a result, future government involvement and leadership may serve to accelerate widespread adoption of interoperable clinical information systems.",M1

20501926,"<e>US</e> trends in prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, 1988-2008.CONTEXT: Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and treatment and control of hypertension reduces risk. The Healthy People 2010 goal was to achieve blood pressure (BP) control in 50% of the US population. OBJECTIVE: To assess progress in treating and controlling hypertension in the United States from 1988-2008. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988-1994 and 1999-2008 in five 2-year blocks included 42 856 adults aged older than 18 years, representing a probability sample of the US civilian population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hypertension was defined as systolic BP of at least 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP of at least 90 mm Hg, self-reported use of antihypertensive medications, or both. Hypertension control was defined as systolic BP values of less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP values of less than 90 mm Hg. All survey periods were age-adjusted to the year 2000 US population. RESULTS: Rates of hypertension increased from 23.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.7%-25.2%) in 1988-1994 to 28.5% (95% CI, 25.9%-31.3%; P &lt; .001) in 1999-2000, but did not change between 1999-2000 and 2007-2008 (29.0%; 95% CI, 27.6%-30.5%; P = .24). Hypertension control increased from 27.3% (95% CI, 25.6%-29.1%) in 1988-1994 to 50.1% (95% CI, 46.8%-53.5%; P = .006) in 2007-2008, and BP among patients with hypertension decreased from 143.0/80.4 mm Hg (95% CI, 141.9-144.2/79.6-81.1 mm Hg) to 135.2/74.1 mm Hg (95% CI, 134.2-136.2/73.2-75.0 mm Hg; P = .02/P &lt; .001). Blood pressure control improved significantly more in absolute percentages between 1999-2000 and 2007-2008 vs 1988-1994 and 1999-2000 (18.6%; 95% CI, 13.3%-23.9%; vs 4.1%; 95% CI, -0.5% to 8.8%; P &lt; .001). Better BP control reflected improvements in awareness (69.1%; 95% CI, 67.1%-71.1%; vs 80.7%; 95% CI, 78.1%-83.0%; P for trend = .03), treatment (54.0%; 95% CI, 52.0%-56.1%; vs 72.5%; 95% CI, 70.1%-74.8%; P = .004), and proportion of patients who were treated and had controlled hypertension (50.6%; 95% CI, 48.0%-53.2%; vs 69.1%; 95% CI, 65.7%-72.3%; P = .006). Hypertension control improved significantly between 1988-1994 and 2007-2008, across age, race, and sex groups, but was lower among individuals aged 18 to 39 years vs 40 to 59 years (P &lt; .001) and 60 years or older (P &lt; .001), and in Hispanic vs white individuals (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure was controlled in an estimated 50.1% of all patients with hypertension in NHANES 2007-2008, with most of the improvement since 1988 occurring after 1999-2000. Hypertension control was significantly lower among younger than middle-aged individuals and older adults, and Hispanic vs white individuals.",M1
20498408,"Comparison of anticancer drug coverage decisions in the United States and United Kingdom: does the evidence support the rhetoric?PURPOSE: In contrast to the United States, several European countries have health technology assessment programs for drugs, many of which assess cost effectiveness. Coverage decisions that consider cost effectiveness may lead to restrictions in access. METHODS: For a purposive sample of five decision-making bodies, we analyzed <e>US</e> and United Kingdom coverage decisions on all anticancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2004 to 2008. Data sources for the timing and outcome of licensing and coverage decisions included published and unpublished documentation, Web sites, and personal communication. RESULTS: The FDA approved 59 anticancer drugs over the study period, of which 46 were also approved by the European Medicines Agency. In the United States, 100% of drugs were covered, mostly without restriction. However, the United Kingdom bodies made positive coverage decisions for less than half of licensed drugs (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE]: 39%; Scottish Medicines Consortium [SMC]: 43%). Whereas the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) covered all 59 drugs from the FDA license date, delays were evident for some Regence Group decisions that were informed by cost effectiveness (median, 0 days; semi-interquartile range [SIQR], 122 days; n = 22). Relative to the European Medicines Agency license date, median time to coverage was 783 days (SIQR, 170 days) for NICE and 231 days (SIQR, 129 days) for the SMC. CONCLUSION: Anticancer drug coverage decisions that consider cost effectiveness are associated with greater restrictions and slower time to coverage. However, this approach may represent an explicit alternative to rationing achieved through the use of patient copayments.",M1

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between breakfast skipping and type of breakfast consumed with nutrient intake, nutrient adequacy, and adiposity status. SUBJECTS: Children aged 9 to 13 years (n=4,320) and adolescents aged 14 to 18 years (n=5,339). DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2006. METHODS: Breakfast consumption was self-reported. A 24-hour dietary recall was used to assess nutrient intakes. Mean adequacy ratio (MAR) for micronutrients and anthropometric indexes were evaluated. Covariate-adjusted sample-weighted means were compared using analysis of variance and Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons among breakfast skippers (breakfast skippers), ready-to-eat (RTE) cereal consumers, and other breakfast (other breakfast) consumers. RESULTS: Twenty percent of children and 31.5% of adolescents were breakfast skippers; 35.9% of children and 25.4% of adolescents consumed RTE cereal. In children/adolescents, RTE cereal consumers had lower intakes of total fat and cholesterol and higher intakes of total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, and several micronutrients (P&lt;0.05 for all) than breakfast skippers and other breakfast consumers. RTE cereal consumers had the highest MAR for micronutrients, and MAR was the lowest for breakfast skippers (P&lt;0.05). In children/adolescents, breakfast skippers had higher body mass index-for-age z scores (P&lt;0.05) and a higher waist circumference (P&lt;0.05) than RTE cereal and other breakfast consumers. Prevalence of obesity (body mass index &gt; or = 95th percentile) was higher in breakfast skippers than RTE cereal consumers (P&lt;0.05) in children/adolescents and was higher in other breakfast consumers than RTE cereal consumers only in adolescents (P&lt;0.05).

OBJECTIVE: To compare biological activity of various European D pteronyssinus diagnostic extracts against an FDA-validated extract using quantitative skin prick tests. METHODS: Six diagnostic D pteronyssinus extracts (1 reference extract, which was made up of 10,000 AU/mL of the FDA-approved extract; 3 European extracts; 1 <e>US</e>-Mexican extract, which is imported as raw material from the United States and sold in Mexico; and 1 Mexican extract) were tested during 2 skin prick test sessions as a concentrate and 2 serial 2-fold dilutions, in quadruplicate, on the backs of 19 patients with D pteronyssinus allergic rhinitis. The Wilcoxon test for linked random samples was used in each group to investigate whether the distribution of the reference extract differed from each of the test extracts to a statistically significant degree (test level alpha = .05). RESULTS: Extracts showed good dose response in wheal size for the concentrate compared with the 2 dilutions (steep part of the curve). All 3 European extracts (2-sided asymptotic significance, P = .003, P = .009, and P = .01, respectively) and 1 Mexican (P &lt; .001) extract were less potent than the reference extract. European extracts varied in potency from 5,400 to 6,126 AU/mL, the US-Mexican extract had a potency of 7,444 AU/mL, and the Mexican extract had a potency of 2,099 AU/mL.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a similar geographic difference exists for emergency department (ED) visits for acute allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis). METHODS: We combined National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data for ED visits to noninstitutional hospitals from 1993 to 2005. Acute allergic reactions were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 995.0, 995.60-995.69, 995.1, 995.2, 995.3, 989.5, and 693.1, and visit rates were compared across standardized geographic divisions. RESULTS: Between 1993 and 2005, there were 17.3 million ED visits for acute allergic reactions, representing 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2%-1.3%) of all ED visits. Per 1000 population, the Northeast had 5.5 visits (95% CI, 4.7-6.2 visits) and the South had 4.9 visits (95% CI, 4.3-5.6 visits). In a multivariable model, the Northeast had a higher odds ratio (OR) than the South (1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27; P = .04).

Estimates for patients in the United States in earlier time periods were compared with that of Philippine residents to estimate delay in achievements of comparable levels of survival. RESULTS: Childhood leukaemia and lymphoma relative survival was much lower in Filipinos living in the Philippines (32.9 and 47.7%) than in Asian Americans (80.1 and 90.5%) and Caucasians (81.9 and 87%). Achievement of comparable survival rates of Philippine residents lagged behind by 20 to &gt;30 years compared with patients in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: The large differences in survival estimates of US populations and Philippine residents highlight the deficiencies of paediatric cancer care delivery in the Philippines. The long survival lag underlines the need for major improvements in access to diagnostic and treatment facilities.",M1
20485126,"Incidence of primary blast injury in <e>US</e> military overseas contingency operations: a retrospective study.OBJECTIVES: The present retrospective study was performed to determine the incidence and outcome of primary blast injury and to identify possible changes over the course of the conflicts between 2003 and 2006. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Combat physicians treating patients injured in overseas contingency operations observed an increase in the severity of explosion injuries occurring during this period. METHODS: This retrospective study included service members injured in explosions between March 2003 and October 2006. The Joint Theater Trauma Registry provided demographic information, injury severity score, and International Classification of Diseases 9 codes used to diagnose primary blast injury. Autopsy reports of the last 497 combat-related deaths of 2006 were also reviewed. RESULTS: Of 9693 admissions, of which 6687 were injured in combat, 4765 (49%) were injured by explosions: 2588 in 2003-2004 and 1935 in 2005-2006. Dates of injury were unavailable for 242 casualties. Injury severity score (9 +/- 10 vs. 11 +/- 10, P &lt; 0.0001) and incidence of primary blast injury (12% vs. 15%, P &lt; 0.01) increased. The return-to-duty rate decreased (40% vs. 18%, P &lt; 0.001), but mortality remained low (1.4% vs. 1.5%, P = NS). There was no significant difference in incidence of primary blast injury between personnel who were killed in action and those who died of wounds at a medical facility. CONCLUSIONS: Injury severity and incidence of primary blast injury increased during the 4-year period, whereas return-to-duty rates decreased. Despite increasingly devastating injuries, the mortality rate due to explosion injuries remained low and unchanged.",M1

20479338,"Impact of family and gender on career goals: results of a national survey of 4586 surgery residents.OBJECTIVE: To determine how marriage, children, and gender influence <e>US</e> categorical general surgery residents' perceptions of their profession and motivations for specialty training. DESIGN: Cross-sectional national survey administered after the January 2008 American Board of Surgery In-service Training Examination. SETTING: Two hundred forty-eight US general surgery residency programs. PARTICIPANTS: All US categorical general surgery residents. INTERVENTIONS: We evaluated demographic characteristics with respect to survey responses using the chi(2) test, analysis of variance, and multivariate logistic regression. Interaction terms between variables were assessed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceptions of respondents regarding the future of general surgery and the role of specialty training in relation to anticipated income and lifestyle. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 75.0% (4586 respondents). Mean age was 30.6 years; 31.7% were women, 51.3% were married, and 25.4% had children. Of the respondents, 28.7% believed general surgery is becoming obsolete (30.1% of men and 25.9% of women; P = .004), and 55.1% believed specialty training is necessary for success (56.4% of men and 52.7% of women; P = .02). Single residents and residents without children were more likely to plan for fellowship (59.1% single vs 51.9% married, P &lt; .001; 57.0% with no children vs 50.1% with children, P &lt; .001). In our multivariate analyses, male gender was an independent predictor of worry that general surgery is becoming obsolete (P = .003). Female residents who were single or had no children tended to identify lifestyle rather than income as a motivator for specialty training. CONCLUSION: Marital status, children, and gender appear to have a powerful effect on general surgery residents' career planning.",M1
20473209,"Lower stroke mortality among Hispanics: an exploration of potential methodological confounders.OBJECTIVES: Stroke mortality rates are reported to be lower for Hispanics than non-Hispanic Whites. We investigate the degree to which this lower reported mortality is explained by inaccuracies introduced through omission of nativity, imprecise measurement of cause of death, and under-ascertainment of Hispanic ethnicity on death certificates. We used national vital registration data for the years 1989-1991 and 1999-2002, including foreign- and <e>US</e>-born Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites. Hispanic deaths were adjusted for misclassification of ethnicity on the death certificate. Denominators for the rates were derived from census estimates. RESULTS: Adjustment for nativity and death certificate misclassification removes the stroke mortality advantage for US-born Hispanic men, but not women. After adjustment, US-born Hispanic men and women have higher rates of mortality from subarachnoid hemorrhage than non-Hispanic Whites (RR: 1.23 and 1.23, respectively), but lower rates of mortality from Ischemic (RR: 0.76 and 0.73, respectively) and chronic effects of stroke (RR: 0.87 and 0.73, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: When adjusted for misclassification the lower stroke mortality remains for Hispanic men and women at older ages. Part of the previously reported advantage is a combination of imprecise measurement and data quality.",M1

20466960,"An impact evaluation of a federal mine safety training regulation on injury rates among <e>US</e> stone, sand, and gravel mine workers: an interrupted time-series analysis.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the impact of a safety training regulation, implemented by the US Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in 1999, on injury rates at stone, sand, and gravel mining operations. METHODS: We applied a time-series design and analyses with quarterly counts of nonfatal injuries and employment hours from 7998 surface aggregate mines from 1995 through 2006. Covariates included standard industrial classification codes, ownership, and injury severity. RESULTS: Overall crude rates of injuries declined over the 12-year period. Reductions in incident rates for medical treatment only, restricted duty, and lost-time injuries were consistent with temporal trends and provided no evidence of an intervention effect attributable to the MSHA regulation. Rates of permanently disabling injuries (PDIs) declined markedly. Regression analyses documented a statistically significant reduction in the risk rate in the postintervention time period (risk rate = 0.591; 95% confidence interval = 0.529, 0.661). CONCLUSIONS: Although a causal relationship between the regulatory intervention and the decline in the rate of PDIs is plausible, inconsistency in the results with the other injury-severity categories preclude attributing the observed outcome to the MSHA regulation. Further analyses of these data are needed.",M1

Drawing on tobacco industry documents and other material, we show how the US government, tobacco industry, and veterans' organizations each took inconsistent positions to protect their interests. Congress and Department of Veterans Affairs leadership, concerned about costs, characterized veterans' smoking as  willful misconduct,  thereby contradicting the government's position in a federal lawsuit that tobacco companies addicted smokers. Veterans' groups supported the pensions, despite previously defending smoking as a  right.  The tobacco industry wavered, fearing liability. Securing pensions was complicated by the notion that smoking is primarily a personal choice. The US government should compensate veterans fairly and should abolish military practices that encourage tobacco addiction.",M1

20435719,"Future research directions to identify causes of the increasing incidence rate of congenital hypothyroidism in the United States.A workshop to evaluate the reported increasing trend in the incidence rate of primary congenital hypothyroidism (CH) identified by newborn screening was held February 27 and 28, 2008, in Atlanta, Georgia, and was sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center. Through a series of presentations and discussions, this group of experts considered a variety of factors that could be contributing to the perceived increasing trend of the CH-incidence rate, the gaps in knowledge that need to be overcome to identify the causes of the observed trend, and possible future research activities that might resolve the uncertainties surrounding the increasing incidence rate of CH in the United States. On the basis of these discussions, workshop participants concluded that the initial focus of future efforts should be to determine if the increasing CH-incidence rate persists once there is standardization of the diagnostic criteria for the classification of CH versus transient hypothyroidism. In discussions, workshop participants suggested that if the increasing incidence rate of CH could not be explained by definitional issues, then future research could focus on the identification and evaluation of risk factors for CH that might be changing among the <e>US</e> population and, thus, contributing to the observed increasing incidence rate of CH.",M1
20435716,"Trends in incidence rates of congenital hypothyroidism related to select demographic factors: data from the United States, California, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas.Primary congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a common and preventable cause of intellectual disability. The incidence rate of CH has been reported to be increasing in the United States, but the factors behind the observed rate increase are not known. We summarize here the data presented at a workshop on CH, at which factors potentially related to the CH-incidence-rate increase (namely, race, ethnicity, sex, and birth outcomes) were evaluated. Data sources for the analyses included a national data set of newborn-screening results and state-specific data from newborn-screening programs in California, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas. The incidence rate of CH increased in the United States by 3% per year; however, an increase did not occur in all states, at a constant rate, or even at the same rate. Analysis of <e>US</e> data (1991-2000) showed a CH-incidence-rate increase only among white newborns. More recently, in California (2000-2007), the rate was constant in non-Hispanic newborns, but it increased among Hispanic newborns. In the national data, the CH-incidence rate increased similarly among boys and girls, whereas in Texas (1992-2006), the rate among boys increased significantly more than among girls and varied according to race and ethnicity. In Massachusetts (1995-2007), low birth weight newborns or newborns who had a delayed rise in thyrotropin concentration accounted for the majority of the recent rate increase. Race, ethnicity, sex, and pregnancy outcomes have affected the observed increasing incidence rate of CH, although there have been some inconsistencies and regional differences. The association with preterm birth or low birth weight could reflect the misclassification of some cases of transient hypothyroxinemia as true CH. Future studies of risk factors should focus on correct initial identification and reporting of demographic characteristics and pregnancy outcomes for cases of CH. In addition, long-term follow-up data of presumed cases of CH should be ascertained to differentiate true cases of CH from cases of transient hypothyroidism.",M1
20461144,"Burden of COPD in a government health care system: a retrospective observational study using data from the <e>US</e> Veterans Affairs population.BACKGROUND: Health care utilization and costs among US veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were compared with those in veterans without COPD. METHODS: A cohort of veterans with COPD was matched for age, sex, race, and index fiscal year to a cohort of veterans without COPD (controls) using data from the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 16 from 10/1/1997 to 9/30/2004. Annual total and respiratory-related health care service utilization, costs of care, comorbidities, and respiratory medication use at the time of diagnosis were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 59,906 patients with COPD were identified for a 7-year period prevalence of 8.2%, or 82 per 1000 population. Patients with COPD compared with controls had significantly higher all-cause and respiratory-related inpatient and outpatient health care utilization for every parameter examined including mean numbers of physician encounters, other outpatient encounters, emergency room visits, acute inpatient discharges, total bed days of care, and percentage of patients with any emergency room visits or any acute inpatient discharge. Patients with COPD had statistically significantly higher mean outpatient, inpatient, pharmacy, and total costs than the control group. The mean Charlson comorbidity index in patients with COPD was 1 point higher than in controls (2.85 versus 1.84, P &lt; 0.001). 60% of COPD patients were prescribed medications recommended in treatment guidelines at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Veterans with COPD compared with those without COPD suffer a tremendous disease burden manifested by higher rates of all-cause and respiratory-related health care utilization and costs and a high prevalence of comorbidities. Furthermore, COPD patients do not receive appropriate treatment for their disease on diagnosis.",M1
20457912,"Effects of the USA PATRIOT Act and the 2002 Bioterrorism Preparedness Act on select agent research in the United States.A bibliometric analysis of the Bacillus anthracis and Ebola virus archival literature was conducted to determine whether negative consequences of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism  (USA PATRIOT) Act and the 2002 Bioterrorism Preparedness Act on <e>US</e> select agent research could be discerned. Indicators of the health of the field, such as number of papers published per year, number of researchers authoring papers, and influx rate of new authors, indicated an overall stimulus to the field after 2002. As measured by interorganizational coauthorships, both B. anthracis and Ebola virus research networks expanded after 2002 in terms of the number of organizations and the degree of collaboration. Coauthorship between US and non US scientists also grew for Ebola virus but contracted for the subset of B. anthracis research that did not involve possession of viable, virulent bacteria. Some non-US institutions were dropped, and collaborations with others intensified. Contrary to expectations, research did not become centralized around a few gatekeeper institutions. Two negative effects were detected. There was an increased turnover rate of authors in the select agent community that was not observed in the control organism (Klebsiella pneumoniae) research community. However, the most striking effect observed was not associated with individual authors or institutions; it was a loss of efficiency, with an approximate 2- to 5-fold increase in the cost of doing select agent research as measured by the number of research papers published per millions of US research dollars awarded.",M1

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An AABB-appointed TRALI working group designed a set of questions about TRALI risk reduction for platelets (PLTs) and plasma. AABB member institutions were asked to respond via an Internet-based survey during a 3-week period in August through September 2009. RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 47 <e>US</e> blood centers (accounting for 1.57 million apheresis PLT units and 3.15 million whole blood-derived transfusable plasma units) and 56 hospital blood collectors. Among the blood centers, 87 and 98% had initiated some PLT and plasma risk reduction, respectively. HLA antibody testing of plateletpheresis donors was performed by 20 (43%) blood centers. There was substantial variation in the number of pregnancies (from one to more than four) that triggered testing and most centers did not screen based on a transfusion history. Almost all centers had policies to redirect HLA antibody-positive donors to whole blood donation and to potentially retest HLA antibody-negative donors. There were no blood centers performing HNA antibody testing. Sex-based risk reduction policies for plasma included all male, or predominantly male, and never-pregnant females; these varied by blood center, blood group, and method of plasma collection. A majority of centers indicated increased production of plasma frozen within 24 hours after phlebotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 3 years after the publication of the initial AABB bulletin on this issue, TRALI risk reduction strategies are commonly employed at most US blood centers. However, procedures are not uniform.",M1

Population-based incidence rates and comprehensive clinical characterizations of disease have not been established. METHODS: We conducted population-based prospective surveillance for 2 years in 2 <e>US</e> counties of HMPV infection among children &lt;5 years old who were hospitalized with ARI or fever. Nasal and throat specimens obtained with swabs were tested for HMPV by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and genotyped. RESULTS: Forty-two (3.8%) of 1104 children tested positive for HMPV. The overall annual rate of HMPV-associated hospitalizations per 1000 children &lt;5 years old was 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-1.6). This rate was highest among infants 0-5 months old (4.9 per 1000 [95% CI, 2.9-7.2]), followed by children 6-11 months old (2.9 per 1000 [95% CI, 1.4-4.7]). The annual rate of hospitalization for HMPV infection was less than that for respiratory syncytial virus infection but similar to that for influenza and parainfluenza virus 3 infection in all age groups. The mean age of children hospitalized with HMPV infection was 6 months. Bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and asthma were the most common diagnoses among children with HMPV infection. All 4 HMPV subgroups were detected during both years at both sites. HPMV infection was most prominent from March through May. CONCLUSION: HMPV was detected in 3.8% of children hospitalized with ARI or fever, with a population incidence similar to that of influenza virus and parainfluenza virus 3.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and patients gave written informed consent. US, CT, T1-weighted MR imaging, and (1)H MR spectroscopy were performed preoperatively in 46 patients. Imaging results were correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient) with histopathologic analysis of results of intraoperative liver biopsies. To assess differences between groups, one-way analysis of variance was used. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each imaging modality by using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, with a histopathologic cut-off value of 5% macrovesicular steatosis. Differences in sensitivity and specificity were assessed by means of McNemar analysis. RESULTS: At histopathologic examination, 23 patients had no (0%-5%) macrovesicular steatosis, 11 had mild (5%-33%), nine had moderate (33%-66%), and three had severe (&gt;66%). MR imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopic measurements of hepatic fat had stronger correlation with histopathologic steatosis assessment (r = 0.85, P &lt; .001 and r = 0.86, P &lt; .001, respectively) than did US (r = 0.66, P &lt; .001) and CT (r = -0.55, P &lt; .001). Only T1-weighted MR imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy showed differences across steatosis grades: none versus mild (P = .001 for both), mild versus moderate (P &lt; .001 for both), and moderate versus severe (P = .04 and .01, respectively). Sensitivity of US, CT, T1-weighted MR imaging, and (1)H MR spectroscopy was 65% (13 of 20), 74% (17 of 23), 90% (19 of 21), and 91% (21 of 23), respectively, and specificity was 77% (17 of 23), 70% (14 of 20), 91% (20 of 22), and 87% (20 of 23), respectively. CONCLUSION: In contrast to US and CT, T1-weighted MR imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy strongly correlate with histopathologic steatosis assessment and are able to demonstrate differences across steatosis grades. T1-weighted dual-echo MR imaging and (1)H MR spectroscopy had the best diagnostic accuracy in depicting hepatic steatosis.",M2
20574088,"Sentinel lymph nodes in the rat: noninvasive photoacoustic and <e>US</e> imaging with a clinical US system.PURPOSE: To evaluate in vivo sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping by using photoacoustic and ultrasonographic (US) imaging with a modified clinical US imaging system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Animal protocols were approved by the Animal Studies Committee. Methylene blue dye accumulation in axillary lymph nodes of seven healthy Sprague-Dawley rats was imaged by using a photoacoustic imaging system adapted from a clinical US imaging system. To investigate clinical translation, the imaging depth was extended up to 2.5 cm by adding chicken or turkey breast on top of the rat skin surface. Three-dimensional photoacoustic images were acquired by mechanically scanning the US transducer and light delivery fiber bundle along the elevational direction. RESULTS: Photoacoustic images of rat SLNs clearly help visualization of methylene blue accumulation, whereas coregistered photoacoustic/US images depict lymph node positions relative to surrounding anatomy. Twenty minutes following methylene blue injection, photoacoustic signals from SLN regions increased nearly 33-fold from baseline signals in preinjection images, and mean contrast between SLNs and background tissue was 76.0 +/- 23.7 (standard deviation). Methylene blue accumulation in SLNs was confirmed photoacoustically by using the optical absorption spectrum of the dye. Three-dimensional photoacoustic images demonstrate dynamic accumulation of methylene blue in SLNs after traveling through lymph vessels. CONCLUSION: In vivo photoacoustic and US mapping of SLNs was successfully demonstrated with a modified clinical US scanner. These results raise confidence that photoacoustic and US imaging can be used clinically for accurate, noninvasive imaging of SLNs for axillary lymph node staging in breast cancer patients.",M2
20443459,"Texture analysis of carotid artery atherosclerosis from three-dimensional ultrasound images.PURPOSE: To quantitatively evaluate local carotid arterial statin effects in 3D <e>US</e> images using multiclassifier image texture analysis tools. METHODS: Texture analysis tools were used to evaluate the effect of 80 mg atorvastatin administered daily to patients with carotid stenosis compared to those treated with placebo. Using three-dimensional carotid ultrasound images, 270 texture features from seven texture techniques were extracted from manually segmented carotid arteries based on the intima-media boundary [vessel wall (VW)]. Individual texture features were compared to the previously determined changes in VW volume (VWV) using the distance between classes, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and accuracy of the classifiers. Texture features that resulted in maximal classification accuracy from each texture technique were selected using Pudil's sequential floating forward selection (SFFS) as a method of ranking each technique. Finally, SFFS-selected texture features from all texture techniques were used in combination with 24 classifier fusion techniques to improve classification accuracy. RESULTS: Using the measurement of change in VWV, the distance between classes (DBC), Wilcoxon rank sum (WRS) p-value, and median accuracy measures (ACC) were 0.3798, 0.076, and 54.50%, respectively. Texture features improved the detection of statin-related changes using DBC to 0.5199, using WRS to 0.002, and ACC to 63.87%, respectively. The texture techniques that most differentiated between atorvastatin and placebo classes were Fourier power spectrum and Laws texture energy measures. The average classification accuracy between atorvastatin and placebo classes was improved from 57.22 +/- 12.11% using VWV to 97.87 +/- 3.93% using specific texture features. Furthermore, the use of specific texture features resulted in the average area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) a value of 0.9988 +/- 0.0069 compared to 0.617 +/- 0.15 using carotid VWV. CONCLUSIONS: Based on DBC, WRS, ACC, and AUC texture features derived from 3D carotid ultrasound were observed to be more sensitive in detecting statin-related changes in carotid atherosclerosis than VWV suggesting that texture classifiers can be used to detect changes in carotid atherosclerosis after therapy.",M2
20350690,"Potential of first arriving signal to assess cortical bone geometry at the Hip with QUS: a model based study.There is evidence that quantitative ultrasound (QUS) at the proximal femur involves waves propagating circumferentially in the cortical shell. These waves, in theory, convey information on bone geometrical and material characteristics and thus have the potential to improve fracture risk prediction. In this work, the time-of-flight (TOF) of the first arriving signal (FAS) that corresponds to waves propagating circumferentially is considered. The relationships between the TOF of the FAS and geometrical features of the femoral neck are investigated. Five neck cross-sections from 11 human femurs from females (&gt;65y) were extracted from 3-D X-ray quantitative computed tomography (XR-QCT) datasets. Geometrical parameters including cross-sectional area (CSA), minimum moment of inertia (I(min)) and section modulus (Z) were computed from femoral neck cross-section images. Two-dimensional numerical simulation of <e>US</e> propagation through femoral neck was performed and TOF of the FAS was estimated. TOF was best correlated with I(min): R(2)=0.82 (p=10(-4); RMSE=1390mm(4) [13%]) in the region between proximal and mid-femoral neck and with Z: R(2)=0.55 (p&lt;10(-2); RMSE=480mm(3) [17%]) and CSA: R(2)=0.62 (p&lt;5.10(-3); RMSE=22mm(2) [7%]) in the mid-femoral neck.

20350680,"Characterization of focal liver lesions with contrast-enhanced ultrasound.The introduction of second generation microbubble ultrasound (<e>US</e>) contrast agents, such as SonoVue (Bracco, Milan, Italy), has considerably improved the diagnostic yield of US imaging for the evaluation of focal hepatic lesions in recent years because of its ability to very sensitively depict tumoral vascularity. In addition, contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) has the advantage of the absence of ionizing radiation, the widespread availability, even at the bedside, and the possibility to characterize a lesion as soon as detected on conventional B-mode US, commonly used as the first technique for exploration of the liver. The present review focuses on the basic principles of the technique and the various patterns of benign and malignant hepatic lesions at CEUS, contributing to their characterization. Understanding of these enhancement features at CEUS according to the type of tumors enables to make more accurate characterization of focal liver lesions as well as give better advice to oncologists, hepatologists or other clinicians in case of suspected liver tumors.",M2

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have frequent imaging studies due to disease recurrences and need of follow-up after treatment. Thus this group of pediatric patients benefits most from an optimized and standardized bowel US. This review provides a comprehensive step-by-step approach how to perform US of the bowel in children with emphasis on imaging inflammatory bowel changes.

20212392,"[Optimized use of cross-sectional imaging for the early diagnosis and management of ankylosing spondyloarthropathy]It is becoming increasingly desirable to diagnose ankylosing spondyloarthropathy (AS) at its pre-radiographic stage (prior to the presence of sacro-iliitis on radiographs). MRI plays a key role for early diagnosis of AS, as illustrated by recently proposed international diagnostic criteria (ASAS). MRI of the SI joints is most helpful for early diagnosis; sequences using fat suppression and/or Gadolinium administration are necessary for the detection of inflammatory changes. However, the rate of false positive and false negative results of MR imaging of the SI joints, especially early in the course of the disease, is unknown and requires prudent interpretation of imaging findings. In patients with normal MRI examination of the SI joints and/or if symptoms are limited to the spine, MRI of the lumbar spine with STIR and/or Gadolinium administration may be helpful; again the positive and negative predictive values are unknown, especially early in the course of the disease. The demonstration of inflammatory changes on MRI, at the axial level, could be an indication for anti-TNF treatment, outside of WMA (national and international recommendations). The role of Doppler <e>US</e>, especially for peripheral entheses, remains hypothetical for early diagnosis.

20212374,"[Mature and immature ovarian teratomas: <e>US</e>, CT and MR imaging features]Mature cystic ovarian teratomas, also called dermoid cysts, are one of the most frequent ovarian tumors of younger female patients and are suggested when a fat-containing cystic tumor is identified on imaging. However, the presence of fat is not pathognomonic for dermoid cyst, and it may also be identified in immature teratomas, whose prognosis and treatment are different. Some imaging features are helpful to differentiate between both tumors, including th epresence of enhancement on CT and MRI. Knowledge of the imaging features of these tumors allows for a confident diagnosis to be made in most cases. A few rare and less typical imaging features should also be recognized.",M2
20207388,"Evaluation of therapeutic ultrasound equipment performance.The therapeutic ultrasound (<e>US</e>) is one of the resources mostly used by physiotherapists; however the use of uncalibrated equipment results in inefficient or even harmful therapies to the patient. In this direction, the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance and the procedures of utilization and maintenance of US in use in clinics and Physical-therapy offices. A questionnaire with questions related to the procedures applied in service during the use of therapeutic ultrasound was applied to physiotherapists. The performance of 31 equipment of 6 different brands and 13 different models was evaluated according to the IEC 61689 norm. The parameters measured were: acoustic power; effective radiating area (AER); non-uniformity ratio of the beam (RBN); maximum effective intensity; acoustic frequency of operation, modulation factor and wave form on pulsate mode. As for the questionnaires, it was evident that the professionals are not concerned about the calibration of the equipment. The results demonstrated that only 32.3% of the equipment were in accordance with the norms for the variables power and effective radiation area. The frequency analysis indicated that 20% of the 3MHz transducers and 12.5% of the 1MHz contemplated the norms. In the pulsate mode, 12.7% presented relation rest/duration inside allowed limits. A great variation of the ultrasonic field was observed on the obtained images, which presented beams not centered, sometimes with bifurcation of its apex. The results allow concluding that, although used in therapeutic sessions with the population, none of the equipment presents all the analyzed variables inside technical norms.",M2
20199926,"Registering preprocedure volumetric images with intraprocedure 3-D ultrasound using an ultrasound imaging model.For many image-guided interventions there exists a need to compute the registration between preprocedure image(s) and the physical space of the intervention. Real-time intraprocedure imaging such as ultrasound (<e>US</e>) can be used to image the region of interest directly and provide valuable anatomical information for computing this registration. Unfortunately, real-time US images often have poor signal-to-noise ratio and suffer from imaging artefacts. Therefore, registration using US images can be challenging and significant preprocessing is often required to make the registrations robust. In this paper we present a novel technique for computing the image-to-physical registration for minimally invasive cardiac interventions using 3-D US. Our technique uses knowledge of the physics of the US imaging process to reduce the amount of preprocessing required on the 3-D US images. To account for the fact that clinical US images normally undergo significant image processing before being exported from the US machine our optimization scheme allows the parameters of the US imaging model to vary. We validated our technique by computing rigid registrations for 12 cardiac US/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from six volunteers and two patients. The technique had mean registration errors of 2.1-4.4 mm, and 75% capture ranges of 5-30 mm. We also demonstrate how the same approach can be used for respiratory motion correction: on 15 datasets acquired from five volunteers the registration errors due to respiratory motion were reduced by 45%-92%.",M2

20185194,"Non-invasive assessment of hepatic steatosis: prospective comparison of the accuracy of imaging examinations.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Despite increasing use of various imaging examinations for non-invasive assessment of hepatic steatosis (HS), their relative accuracy is unknown. The objective of this study is to prospectively compare the accuracy of computed tomography (CT), dual gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging (DGE-MRI), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS), and ultrasonography (<e>US</e>) for the diagnosis and quantitative estimation of HS. METHODS: A total of 161 consecutive potential living liver donors underwent US (performed by two independent radiologists, US1 and US2), CT, DGE-MRI, (1)H-MRS, and liver biopsy on the same day. Using the histologic degree of HS as the reference standard, we compared the diagnostic performance of US1, US2, CT, DGE-MRI, and (1)H-MRS for diagnosing HS &gt;or= 5% and HS &gt;or= 30% and compared the accuracy of CT, DGE-MRI, and (1)H-MRS in the quantitative estimation of HS. RESULTS: DGE-MRI and (1)H-MRS significantly outperformed CT and US for the diagnosis of HS5%. DGE-MRI showed a tendency of higher accuracy than the other examinations for diagnosing HS &gt;or= 30%. The cross-validated sensitivity and specificity of DGE-MRI at the optimal cut-off were 76.7% and 87.1%, respectively, for diagnosing HS &gt;or= 5% and 90.9% and 94%, respectively, for diagnosing HS &gt;or= 30%. The cross-validated Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement between the estimated degree of HS on imaging examinations and the histologic degree of HS, were the narrowest with DGE-MRI, yielding -12.7% to 12.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Among CT, DGE-MRI, (1)H-MRS, and US, DGE-MRI is the most accurate method for the diagnosis and quantitative estimation of HS. Therefore, DGE-MRI may be the preferred imaging examination for the non-invasive assessment of HS.",M2
20172744,"Angioplasty and stent placement in symptomatic internal carotid occlusion.PURPOSE: To report a series of patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion treated with angioplasty and stents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a consecutive series of 50 patients experiencing neurologic ischemic symptoms and shown by conventional ultrasonography (<e>US</e>) to have a total ICA occlusion, 16 patients (ages 45-79 years; mean, 63 y; 10 men) were selected between August 2006 to September 2008 to be treated with angioplasty based on discovery of an open ICA distal to the occlusion through contrast-enhanced echo Doppler imaging and/or multislice contrast computed tomography (CT). Angioplasty and stent placement were performed under cerebral protection. Follow-up duplex imaging was performed at 14 days and 3 months and every 6 months thereafter and CT follow-up was performed at 2-9 months; the mean follow-up period was 9.9 months. RESULTS: Lesion crossing and stent placement was successful in 13 of 16 patients. There were no deaths, conversions, cardiac complications, or major strokes. One patient had a transient mild hemiparesis in the upper limb, with total recovery in 3 months. At follow-up, all 13 patients with a good initial result remained with patent arterial lumens and resolution of neurologic ischemic symptoms. After 2-9 months, ICAs with a  string sign  had calibers close or equal to those of normal arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Angioplasty with stent placement is an effective treatment with a low morbidity rate for selected patients who continue to experience neurologic ischemic symptoms despite US findings of total occlusion of the ICA.",M2
20172448,"Automatic localization of intimal and adventitial carotid artery layers with noninvasive ultrasound: a novel algorithm providing scan quality control.Transcutaneous ultrasound measurements of common carotid artery (CCA) diameter and intima-media thickness (IMT) give insight on arterial dynamics and anatomy, both correlating well with atherosclerosis and risk of cardiovascular disease. We propose a novel automatic algorithm to estimate CCA diameter and IMT in ultrasound (<e>US</e>) images, based on separate analysis of anterior and posterior CCA walls and able to distinguish internal (intima-intima) and external (adventitia-adventitia) diameter. The method combines off-line signal- and image-processing techniques to accommodate echo images acquired at a frame rate of 30 Hz and composed directly from RF data, circumventing digital video-grabbing. Segmentation consists of automatic CCA recognition, followed by adventitial delineation performed with a sustain-attack filter with exponentially decaying reference functions. Intimal delineation is then based on the multiscale anisotropic barycenter (MAB), which is an extension of a known delineation method involving the  first order absolute central moment  of the echo amplitude. An automatic measure of the quality of the US beam incidence for each wall is superimosed on the CCA contour overlays for visual feedback. Validation is carried out on 36 US CCA acquisitions from 12 healthy volunteers, as well as on synthetic US images. Results indicate good accuracy on synthetic US images (within 1.3% for diameter and 3% for IMT). The in vivo intra-recording beat-to-beat variations are on average lower than 50 microm for external diameter and IMT, and lower than 100 microm for internal diameter. A comparison with a commercial device (ART.LAB system) shows that the proposed algorithm performs better in terms of inter-recording precision. The beam incidence control significantly improves the repeatability of IMT estimates, and motivates sonographers actively to maintain a proper scan plane throughout the acquisition to minimize the incidence of confounding factors. The method is clinically viable, providing robust estimates of CCA internal and external diameter and IMT waveforms for both CCA walls, even at a low B-mode update rate of 30 Hz.",M2

20155579,"New detoxification processes for asbestos fibers in the environment.Airborne asbestos fibers are associated with many serious detrimental effects on human health, while the hazard posed by waterborne fibers remains an object of debate. In adopting a precautionary principle, asbestos content in water needs to be kept as low as possible and polluting waters with asbestos should be avoided. Turci et al. (2008) recently reported a method for the decontamination of asbestos-polluted waters or landfill leachates from chrysotile that combines power ultrasound (<e>US</e>) with oxalic acid (Ox), an acidic chelating molecule. In the previous study, the occurrence of antigorite, a polymorph of serpentine, the mineral group encompassing chrysotile asbestos, acted as a confounding factor for complete removal of chrysotile from water. The effects of US + Ox on pure chrysotile asbestos from Val Malenco, Italian Central Alps, were examined in this investigation. In the absence of mineral contaminants, a more rapid removal of pure chrysotile from water was undertaken with respect to the previous specimen. After only 12 h of combined US + Ox acid treatment, imaging (SEM) of mineral debris indicated complete loss of fibrous habit. In addition, crystallography and vibrational features of chrysotile were not detectable (x-ray powder diffraction [XRPD] and micro-Raman spectroscopy) and elemental analysis showed a low Mg/Si ratio, i.e., the loss of the brucitic layer in chrysotile (x-ray fluorescence, XRF). Some nanometric rod-shaped debris, observed in the previous study and tentatively recognized as serpentine antigorite, was now found to be made of amorphous silica, which is relatively safe and noncarcinogenic to humans, providing further assurance regarding the safety of treated product. Thus, data indicated the proposed method was effective in detoxifying waterborne chrysotile asbestos fibers.",M2
20145174,"Metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib: early evaluation of treatment response using dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasonography.PURPOSE: To determine the utility of dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (DCE-<e>US</e>) as a prognostic tool for metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients receiving sunitinib and to identify DCE-US parameters that correlate with early treatment response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty-eight patients received 50 mg/d sunitinib on schedule 4/2 (4 weeks on followed by 2 weeks off treatment). After two cycles, response evaluation criteria in solid tumors were used to classify patients as responders or nonresponders. DCE-US evaluations were done before treatment and at day 15; variations between days 0 and 15 were calculated for seven DCE-US functional parameters and were compared for responders and nonresponders. The correlation between DCE-US parameters and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed. RESULTS: The ratio between DCE-US examinations at baseline and day 15 significantly correlated with response in five of the seven DCE-US parameters. Two DCE-US parameters (time to peak intensity and slope of the wash-in) were significantly associated with DFS; time to peak intensity was also significantly associated with OS. CONCLUSIONS: DCE-US is a useful tool for predicting the early efficacy of sunitinib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients. Robust correlations were observed between functional parameters and classic assessments, including DFS and OS.",M2
20140842,"What should be done with echoic splenic tumors incidentally found by ultrasound?PURPOSE: The incidentally found primary intrasplenic tumor is mostly benign, but leads to a well known clinical problem: B-mode sonography, as well as computed tomography and MRI are often non-specific, and it is unclear whether a histological verification is warranted or a sonographic follow-up is justified. PATIENTS AND METHODS: etween October 2003 and October 2007 40 consecutive patients showed an echoic primary tumor of the spleen incidentally found by B-mode ultrasound (<e>US</e>) and were included in this prospective study. All tumors were classified regarding size and echogenity. In all patients contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was perfomed and tumor enhancement was characterized in comparison to normal splenic enhancement. Patients were followed up every 3 months during the first year, and then once a year. RESULTS: Sizes of the lesions were &lt; 3 cm in diameter in 28 (70 %), between 3 - 5 cm in 10 (25 %) and &gt; 5 cm in 2 (5 %) patients. Lesions were classified as predominantly hypoechoic (n = 27) and hyperechoic (n = 13) on B-mode US. During the arterial phase the lesions showed a hyperechoic (n = 12), isoechoic (n = 8), hypoechoic (n = 14), and anechoic (n = 6) enhancement on CEUS. Median follow was 24.8 months (range 3 - 48 months). Lesions were constant in size (n = 34) or shrinking (n = 5). In one patient a new 5 mm lesion was seen during follow-up. This patient refused the splenectomy and follow-up was continued without further tumor growth. CONCLUSION: Echoic splenic tumors incidentally found by ultrasound can be managed by sonographic follow-up examinations.",M2

20133039,"Sonoporation mediated immunogene therapy of solid tumors.Development of gene-based therapies for the treatment of inherited and acquired diseases, including cancer, has seen renewed interest in the use of nonviral vectors coupled to physical delivery modalities. Low-frequency ultrasound (<e>US</e>), with a well-established record in a clinical setting, has the potential to deliver DNA efficiently, accurately and safely. Optimal in vivo parameters for US-mediated delivery of naked plasmid DNA were established using the firefly luciferase reporter gene construct. Optimized parameters were used to administer a therapeutic gene construct, coding for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and B7-1 costimulatory molecule, to growing murine fibrosarcoma tumors. Tumor progression and animal survival was monitored throughout the study and the efficacy of the US-mediated gene therapy determined and compared with an electroporation-based approach. Optimal parameters for US-mediated delivery of plasmid DNA to tumors were deduced to be 1.0 W/cm(2) at 20% duty cycle for 5 min (60 J/cm(2)). In vivo US-mediated gene therapy resulted in a 55% cure rate in tumor-bearing animals. The immunological response invoked was cell mediated, conferring resistance against re-challenge and resistance to tumor challenge after transfer of splenocytes to naïve animals. US treatment was noninjurious to treated tissue, whereas therapeutic efficacy was comparable to an electroporation-based approach. US-mediated delivery of an immune-gene construct to growing tumors was therapeutically effective. Sonoporation has the potential to be a major factor in the development of nonviral gene delivery approaches.",M2
20129197,"Imaging the joint in osteoarthritis: a place for ultrasound?Ultrasound (<e>US</e>) is a valuable tool for imaging musculoskeletal changes in osteoarthritis. It shows early and late findings related to inflammation and structural damage. Sonography is a safe tool, which has recently registered an increasing and widespread use, it being considered as a bedside procedure in the clinical assessment of rheumatic patients. Its applications in osteoarthritis are related to easy accessibility of equipment, low cost, short duration of single examinations and the possibility of performing a multiregional joint evaluation in the same scanning session. Permitting an extensive evaluation of most joint changes present in osteoarthritis, it gives the opportunity to monitor disease progression and perform a follow-up of the response to different local and systemic treatments.

20127599,"[Localisation of hepatic lesions to liver segments according to sonography (<e>US</e>), computed tomography (CT) and surgery (OP): a comparative study]INTRODUCTION: The localisation of focal liver lesions is usually performed according to the Couinaud classification system. The exact description of localisation and size of liver lesions is especially important for surgical procedures. The aim of this prospective study was the evaluation of differences and agreements in the localisation and size of hepatic lesions as found by ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and according to the intraoperative status (OP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 32 patients (21 male, 11 female) were enrolled in the study. The results obtained from sonography, computed tomography and surgery were classified into 5 categories for localisation and for size, respectively. RESULTS: According to the agreement between sonography and computed tomography, 25 % of all hepatic lesions were classified into category 1 (exact agreement), whereas 40.6 % were ranked into category 2 (almost exact agreement). Correlating sonography and intraoperative results, 31.3 % of the lesions were classified into category 1 and 46.9 % into category 2. In the comparison of CT with OP, 34.4 % of the lesions were found to be in category 1 and 43.8 % in category 2. Concerning the size of the lesions, almost half of the tumours (46.9 %) were classified into category 1 on the basis of the correlation between US and CT and 21.9 % on the basis of the correlation between US and OP. DISCUSSION: The localisation and description of the size of hepatic lesions is mainly similar or even identical on the basis of the different methods. Further improvements might be achieved by the introduction of a consistent nomenclature.",M2
20107249,"Evaluation of imaging technologies to correct for photon attenuation in the overlying tissue for in vivo bone strontium measurements.The interpretation of measurements of bone strontium in vivo using energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy is presently hindered by overlying skin and soft-tissue absorption of the strontium x-rays. The use of imaging technologies to measure the overlying soft-tissue thickness at the index finger measuring site might allow correction of the strontium reading to estimate its concentration in bone. An examination of magnetic resonance (MR), computed tomography (CT) and high-frequency ultrasound (<e>US</e>) imaging technologies revealed that 55 MHz US had the smallest range of measurement uncertainty at 3.2% followed by 1 Tesla MR, 25 MHz US, 8 MHz US and CT at 4.3, 5.4, 6.6 and 7.1% uncertainty, respectively. Of these, only CT imaging appeared to underestimate total thickness (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, an inter-study comparison on the accuracy of US measurements of the overlying tissue thickness at finger and ankle in nine subjects was investigated. The 8 MHz US system used in prior in vivo experiments was found to perform satisfactorily in a repeat study of ankle measurements, but indicated that finger thickness measurements may have been misread in previous studies by up to 17.7% (p &lt; 0.025).

20103420,"Provision of a  same-day  ultrasound service in an inner-city NHS trust: report on experience and lessons learned after the first 2 years.AIM: To assess the effect of changing from an  appointment  to a  same-day  ultrasound (<e>US</e>) service on referral pattern, departmental workload, and patient satisfaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To reduce US waiting time of 3 weeks for routine examinations, a  same-day  service was started for outpatients and general practitioner (GP) patients in September 2006. To examine the effect of this change a retrospective assessment was performed of workload during 1 week in June 2006 (appointments only) and the same week in 2008, 22 months after the implementation of the new service. Distance travelled by patients and waiting time was recorded. Patient satisfaction with the service was assessed by questionnaire in September 2008. RESULTS: Hospital referrals remained stable, but GP referrals increased from 99 to 367 (270%) and distance travelled by patients increased from a median of 3.1 km (range 0.1-12.1 km) in 2006 to 4.8 km (range 0.2-19.8 km) in 2008 (p&lt;0.001). Non-local GP referrals increased from 20/99 in 2006 (20%) to 198/367 in 2008 (54%). The increased workload was managed by flexible working by radiologists and two additional sonographers. Departmental waiting time increased for all patients with same-day patients waiting a median of 35 min (interquartile range 19-60 min). Ninety-one percent (79/87) of same-day patients rated the service excellent or good, but many requested better information on the waiting time. CONCLUSION: There is a demand from GPs for same-day US, and it is feasible in a large hospital with flexible radiology working and increased sonographic staffing. Unless adjacent hospitals offer a similar service, continuing rise in demand could overwhelm the service.",M2
20093529,"Repeat prostate biopsy accuracy: simulator-based comparison of two- and three-dimensional transrectal <e>US</e> modalities.PURPOSE: To compare the accuracy of biopsy with two-dimensional (2D) transrectal ultrasonography (US) with that of biopsy with conventional three-dimensional (3D) transrectal US and biopsy with guided 3D transrectal US in the guidance of repeat prostate biopsy procedures in a prostate biopsy simulator. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Five residents and five experts performed repeat biopsies with a biopsy simulator that contained the transrectal US prostate images of 10 patients who had undergone biopsy. Simulated repeat biopsies were performed with 2D transrectal US, conventional 3D transrectal US, and guided 3D transrectal US (an extension of 3D transrectal US that enables active display of biopsy targets). The modalities were compared on the basis of time per biopsy and how accurately simulated repeat biopsies could be guided to specific targets. The probability for successful biopsy of a repeat target was calculated for each modality. RESULTS: Guided 3D transrectal US was significantly (P &lt; .01) more accurate for simulated biopsy of repeat targets than was 2D or 3D transrectal US, with a biopsy accuracy of 0.86 mm +/- 0.47 (standard deviation), 3.68 mm +/- 2.60, and 3.60 mm +/- 2.57, respectively. Experts had a 70% probability of sampling a prior biopsy target volume of 0.5 cm(3) with 2D transrectal US; however, the probability approached 100% with guided 3D transrectal US. Biopsy accuracy was not significantly different between experts and residents for any modality; however, experts were significantly (P &lt; .05) faster than residents with each modality. CONCLUSION: Repeat biopsy of the prostate with 2D transrectal US has limited accuracy. Compared with 2D transrectal US, the biopsy accuracy of both experts and residents improved with guided 3D transrectal US but did not improve with conventional 3D transrectal US.",M2

20078434,"Sensitivity of bedside ultrasound and supine anteroposterior chest radiographs for the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma.OBJECTIVES: Supine anteroposterior (AP) chest radiographs in patients with blunt trauma have poor sensitivity for the identification of pneumothorax. Ultrasound (<e>US</e>) has been proposed as an alternative screening test for pneumothorax in this population. The authors conducted an evidence-based review of the medical literature to compare sensitivity of bedside US and AP chest radiographs in identifying pneumothorax after blunt trauma. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for trials from 1965 through June 2009 using a search strategy derived from the following PICO formulation of our clinical question: patients included adult (18 + years) emergency department (ED) patients in whom pneumothorax was suspected after blunt trauma. The intervention was thoracic ultrasonography for the detection of pneumothorax. The comparator was the supine AP chest radiograph during the initial evaluation of the patient. The outcome was the diagnostic performance of US in identifying the presence of pneumothorax in the study population. The criterion standard for the presence or absence of pneumothorax was computed tomography (CT) of the chest or a rush of air during thoracostomy tube placement (in unstable patients). Prospective, observational trials of emergency physician (EP)-performed thoracic US were included. Trials in which the exams were performed by radiologists or surgeons, or trials that investigated patients suffering penetrating trauma or with spontaneous or iatrogenic pneumothoraces, were excluded. The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed. Qualitative methods were used to summarize the study results. Data analysis consisted of test performance (sensitivity and specificity, with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of thoracic US and supine AP chest radiography. RESULTS: Four prospective observational studies were identified, with a total of 606 subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The sensitivity and specificity of US for the detection of pneumothorax ranged from 86% to 98% and 97% to 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of supine AP chest radiographs for the detection of pneumothorax ranged from 28% to 75%. The specificity of supine AP chest radiographs was 100% in all included studies. CONCLUSIONS: This evidence-based review suggests that bedside thoracic US is a more sensitive screening test than supine AP chest radiography for the detection of pneumothorax in adult patients with blunt chest trauma.",M2
20069737,"ESUR guidelines for MR imaging of the sonographically indeterminate adnexal mass: an algorithmic approach.A significant proportion of adnexal masses detected by sonography are indeterminate. Either their organ of origin is uncertain or it is unclear whether their nature is benign or malignant. MR imaging of the sonographically indeterminate adnexal mass can resolve most of these uncertainties. Most indeterminate masses result from common benign conditions and women with such masses can avoid unnecessary or inappropriate surgery. For the minority of women whose masses are malignant, use of MR imaging rather than a 'wait and watch' strategy of repeat ultrasound (<e>US</e>) results in a more timely diagnosis. There are simple diagnostic steps in the MR imaging assessment which direct an algorithmic and problem-solving approach based on signal characteristics and morphology.

20043112,"Modified technique for determining therapeutic response to radiofrequency ablation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma using <e>US</e>-volume system.In radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), microbubbles appearing during the procedure make it difficult to determine effectiveness with ultrasonography (US) imaging. We developed a modified US-volume system and evaluated its efficacy for demonstrating response to therapeutic RFA. Our US-volume system displays multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) images providing a synchronized view with a US image along with past US-volume data in real-time side-by-side on a personal computer. Seventy-eight patients (94 nodules) were enrolled, of whom 35 (47 nodules) were evaluated using this system (US-volume group) and compared to the other 43 (47 nodules) examined before development of our system (control group). All nodules were clearly depicted by US. If the shortage of margin was predicted with US-volume system, we performed additional needle insertion. Tumor necrosis following RFA was graded by dynamic computed tomography as follows: Grade A, necrotic area surrounded in all directions with an adequate margin (&gt;or=5 mm); Grade B, necrotic area surrounded in all directions, though some margin areas &lt;5 mm; and Grade C, residual tumor or necrotic area smaller than the target tumor. In the US-volume group, the average tumor size was not smaller than that in the control (15.9+/-4.9 vs. 16.0+/-4.3 mm) and adequate margins were obtained (Grade A, B, C, 45/1/1 vs. 35/8/4; P&lt;0.01). Further, there was a significant reduction in numbers of RFA sessions as compared to the control (1.03+/-0.17 vs. 1.12+/-0.32; P&lt;0.01). In HCC patients undergoing RFA, our modified US-volume system accurately demonstrated therapeutic response, which led to a reduced number of RFA sessions.",M2
20033620,"Comparing calibration approaches for 3D ultrasound probes.OBJECTIVE: By adding a tracking sensor to a 3D ultrasound (<e>US</e>) probe and thus locating the probe in space, new applications within the fields of image guided surgery and radiation therapy are possible. To locate the US volume in space, a calibration is necessary to determine the mathematical transformation for mapping points from the tracking coordinate system to the US image coordinate system. We present a comprehensive comparison of two different approaches to perform this calibration for 3D US. METHODS: For both approaches a phantom is scanned and located in the images by means of segmentation and registration techniques. Calibration is then performed by either relating the tracked phantom's (TP) spatial location to the calibration scans, or by solely correlating scans taken from multiple perspectives when using hand-eye calibration methods (HE). Depending on which approach is utilized, a minimum of one or three images, respectively, need to be acquired for the calibration process. RESULTS: We evaluated both approaches for calibration and reconstruction precision. Regarding the latter, the performed tests led to mean target localization errors of 3.5 mm (HE) and 3.3 mm (TP) for real data, and of 1.4 mm (HE) and 0.9 mm (TP) for simulated data. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that taking additional scans leads to a significant improvement in the calibration. Furthermore, the obtained calibration and reconstruction precisions suggest the use of a TP.",M2

In this paper, we introduce a method which estimates the lateral component of blood flow within a single image frame using the observation that the speckle pattern corresponding to the blood reflectors (typically red blood cells) stretches (i.e., is  smeared ) if the blood is moving in the same direction as the electronically-controlled transducer line selection in a 2D image. The situation is analogous to the observed elongation of a subject photographed with a moving camera. Here, we develop a relationship between speckle size, scan speed, and blood flow velocity. Experiments were performed with a blood flow phantom and high-frequency transducer of a commercially available ultrasound machine. Data was captured through an interface allowing access to the raw beam formed data. Blood flow with velocities ranging from 15 to 40 cm/s were investigated in this paper. Results show that there is a linear relationship between the reciprocal of the stretch factor and blood flow velocity. Two scan speeds were used in our experiments. When the scan velocity is 64.8 cm/s, compared with the theoretical model, fitting results based on experimental data gave <e>us</e> a linear relationship with average flow estimation error of 1.74+/-1.48 cm/s. When the scan velocity is 37.4 cm/s, the average estimation error is 0.65+/-0.45 cm/s.",M2
19960159,"Methotrexate treatment for ectopic pregnancy at the KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore.INTRODUCTION: Ectopic pregnancy is an acute emergency in the first trimester where surgery is the mainstay of treatment. With the advent of improved diagnostic techniques like high-resolution transvaginal ultrasonography and expedient serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) assay, ectopic pregnancy is now diagnosed early. At this stage, the conceptus is often small, causing minimal or no symptoms. Medical management may then present an appealing alternative to surgery. Methotrexate has been widely used to treat ectopic pregnancy. A methotrexate ectopic treatment protocol was introduced by the Minimally Invasive Surgery Centre at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore. We present the results of this treatment. METHODS: A prospective review of 110 cases of medical management of ectopic pregnancy since the implementation of the treatment protocol was undertaken. Demographical data, clinical presentation, treatment progress and outcome were captured using a computer database. All patients were managed as outpatients, and a telephone call-out service was provided to ensure that treatment side effects were monitored and potential treatment failures were identified early. RESULTS: From August 2003 to October 2006, 93 (84.5 percent) patients with ectopic pregnancy were successfully treated with intramuscular methotrexate. 16 patients eventually required surgery and only one patient defaulted on follow-up. There was no major side effect detected in this cohort. The minor side effects reported included mucositis (19.1 percent) and abdominal pain (28.2 percent). CONCLUSION: Methotrexate treatment of ectopic pregnancy is safe. Our treatment protocol enabled <e>us</e> to achieve a reasonable treatment success rate of 84.5 percent.",M2

19942508,"ULA-OP: an advanced open platform for ultrasound research.The experimental test of novel ultrasound (<e>US</e>) investigation methods can be made difficult by the lack of flexibility of commercial US machines. In the best options, these only provide beamformed radiofrequency or demodulated echo-signals for acquisition by an external PC. More flexibility is achieved in high-level research platforms, but these are typically characterized by high cost and large size. This paper presents a powerful but portable US system, specifically developed for research purposes. The system design has been based on high-level commercial integrated circuits to obtain the maximum flexibility and wide data access with minimum of electronics. Preliminary applications involving nonstandard imaging transmit/receive strategies and simultaneous B-mode and multigate spectral Doppler mode are discussed.",M2
19926760,"<e>US</e> of the tunica vaginalis testis: anatomic relationships and pathologic conditions.Extratesticular lesions are common incidental findings at ultrasonography (US) among men and boys. Most lesions originate from or depend on the tunica vaginalis, a mesothelium-lined sac with a visceral layer and a parietal layer. The tunica vaginalis is formed when the superior portion of the processus vaginalis closes during embryologic development. Abnormal closure of the processus vaginalis leads to congenital anomalies of the tunica vaginalis, such as complete or partial patency of the processus vaginalis, spermatic cord hydrocele, and inguinoscrotal hernia. The proximity of the visceral layer to the testis explains the reactive involvement seen in epididymo-orchitis, with resultant pyocele or abscess formation. The tunica vaginalis also may be affected by inflammatory and traumatic disorders such as scrotal calculi, fibrous pseudotumor, or hematocele. These lesions manifest as solid or heterogeneous tumorlike masses. Lesions of mesothelial origin, such as adenomatoid tumor, tunica cyst, and mesothelioma, may involve the tunica vaginalis. Entrapped mesenchymal cells can lead to lipoma, leiomyoma, or sarcoma, although these tumors are uncommon in the tunica vaginalis. US is not useful for differentiating between benign and malignant tumors; however, some characteristic findings may help in planning the best surgical approach. Knowledge of the embryologic development, anatomic relationships, and pathologic disorders of the tunica vaginalis is essential to narrow the differential diagnosis of an extratesticular lesion. In most cases, US findings in combination with clinical assessment can indicate whether nonsurgical management or testis-sparing surgery is warranted.",M2
19910898,"Potential value of elastosonography in the diagnosis of malignancy in thyroid nodules.A firm or hard consistency is associated with an increased risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules. Ultrasound (<e>US</e>) elastosonography is a new powerful diagnostic technique that assesses hardness as indicator of malignancy that was recently applied in the diagnostic approach of nodular thyroid disease. The basic principle of elastosonography is that tissue compression produces strain (displacement), that is less in hard than in soft tissues and is scored measuring the degree of distortion of US beam under the application of an external force, during the examination. The US elastogram is displayed over the B-mode image in a colour scale that corresponds to tissue elasticity. The US elastosonography performed on selected series of patients has displayed a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 98%. The predictivity of US elastographic measurement was independent from the nodule size, high sensitivity and specificity being observed also in nodules &lt;1 cm. These data were also confirmed by other authors in smaller cytological series. Available data suggest that predictivity of US elastosonography is maintained in indeterminate lesions. Conventional US maintains a pivotal importance to define which nodules are suitable for elastographic characterization. Indeed, nodules in which US reveals the presence of calcified shell and cystic nodules have to be excluded from the US elastographic evaluation. Another limitation is that the nodule to be examined must be clearly distinguishable from other nodules present in the thyroid. Thus, multinodular goiters with coalescent nodules are not suitable for this analysis. US elastosonography seems to have a great potential as a new tool for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer, especially in nodules with indeterminate cytology.",M2
19910766,"Prediction of clinical results of laminoplasty for cervical myelopathy focusing on spinal cord motion in intraoperative ultrasonography and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of preoperative imaging and clinical data from patients undergoing cervical expansive laminoplasty for cervical myelopathy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate preoperative parameters that predict the floating status of the spinal cord at the anterior elements of the cervical spine in both intraoperative ultrasonography (<e>US</e>) and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and to evaluate the association between clinical outcome and spinal cord floating. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Intraoperative US has been used to evaluate the status of the spinal cord after cervical laminoplasty for cervical myelopathy. Few studies have evaluated the predictive preoperative parameters for intraoperative US results. METHODS: Imaging and clinical outcome data were collected from 101 consecutive patients who underwent cervical expansive laminoplasty for cervical myelopathy at Kaikoukai Nagoya Kyouritsu Hospital, Japan, from April 2004 to April 2008. The preoperative parameters associated with spinal cord floating in intraoperative US and postoperative MR images were investigated. Predictive parameters for the rate of recovery according to the Japanese Orthopedic Association score for cervical myelopathy at each follow-up session were also investigated. RESULTS: Predictive parameters for spinal cord floating after decompression in intraoperative US were the cervical vertebrae 2 to 7 (C2-C7) sagittal alignment in the standing neutral position on preoperative plain radiograph radiography (cut-off value=3 degrees) and the C5/6  beak angle  in preoperative MRI (cut-off value=20 degrees). A predictive parameter for spinal cord floating in postoperative MRI was the C5/6 beak angle in preoperative MRI (cut-off value=21 degrees). The preoperative Japanese Orthopedic Association score and spinal cord floating at anterior elements of the cervical spine in intraoperative US were predictive parameters for clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative US was more useful than postoperative MRI for predicting the clinical outcome of cervical expansive laminoplasty. Knowledge of the predictive parameters for spinal cord floating after cervical expansive laminoplasty could help evaluate the limitations of posterior decompression.",M2

Despite the ubiquity of the procedure, complications including failure to place the catheter occur. While many clinicians are familiar with the use of ultrasound (<e>US</e>) guidance to decrease complication rates of central venous catheter insertion, fewer are familiar with the use of ultrasound to guide arterial catheterization. This manuscript reviews the evidence for the utility of ultrasound for this indication. Technical aspects of the procedure and limitations of the existing evidence are reviewed. A description of the procedure is provided, along with an online supplemental video. Most studies indicate that first-pass success will be improved with US-guided (USG) arterial catheterization. The technique is easy to learn, particularly if one is already familiar with USG for central venous catheter placement. More research, including formal analyses of cost effectiveness, is needed.",M2
19878827,"Torsional ultrasound efficiency under different vacuum levels in different degrees of nuclear cataract.PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficiency of torsional ultrasound (<e>US</e>) under different vacuum levels in eyes with cataract with different degrees of nuclear density. SETTING: Cataract Service, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. METHODS: In this prospective randomized series, eyes with age-related cataract were divided into 3 groups based on nuclear density. Eyes in each group were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 subgroups and treated with phacoemulsification under vacuum of 250 mm Hg (subgroup 1), 450 mm Hg (subgroup 2), or 600 mm Hg (subgroup 3). Data included preoperative and postoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), endothelial cell density, and central corneal thickness (CCT) and intraoperative US time and cumulative dissipated energy (CDE). RESULTS: The study evaluated 998 patients (1073 eyes). In each group, there was a statistically significant decrease in US time, CDE, and postoperative endothelial cell loss with increased vacuum (P&lt;.05). At 1 day and 7 days, the CDVA was statistically significantly better in subgroups 2 and 3 (P&lt;.05) and the CCT was thinner when vacuum was higher. There was no statistically significant difference in CDVA and CCT between subgroups 30 days postoperatively (P&gt;.05). CONCLUSIONS: Torsional US with a high vacuum level was safe for cataract extraction. With less US energy and endothelial cell loss, torsional US was more efficient than with higher vacuum levels with lower levels.",M2
19857804,"Comparison of different diagnostic methods for differentiating biliary atresia from idiopathic neonatal hepatitis.AIM: To retrospectively analyze different methods in differentiating biliary atresia from idiopathic neonatal hepatitis. METHODS: Sixty-nine infants with cholestatic jaundice and final diagnosis of idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INH) and biliary atresia (BA) were studied retroprospectively from January 2004 to December 2006. A thorough history and physical examination were undertaken. All cases underwent abdominal magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRCP), ultrasonography (<e>US</e>), hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS), HBS single-photon emission computer tomography (HBS SPECT), and operation or percutaneous liver biopsy. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of these various methods were compared. RESULTS: There were 39 girls and 30 boys, among whom 35 had INH (age, 61+/-17 days) and 34 had BA (age, 64+/-18 days). The mean age at onset of jaundice was significantly lower in cases of BA when compared to INH cases (9+/-13 vs. 20+/-21 days; P=.032). The diagnostic accuracy of different methods was as follows: liver biopsy, 97.1%; HBS SPECT, 91.30%; MRCP, 71.01%; HBS, 66.67%; US, 65.22%. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that biopsy of the liver is considered as the most reliable method to differentiate INH from BA. The accuracy of HBS SPECT is higher than that of MRCP, HBS, and US. There was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy among MRCP, HBS, and US.",M2
19856412,"Utility of phase contrast MR imaging for assessment of pulmonary flow and pressure estimation in patients with pulmonary hypertension: comparison with right heart catheterization and echocardiography.PURPOSE: To compare the utility of phase contrast MR imaging (PC-MRI) for assessment of pulmonary flow and pressure estimation with that of right heart catheterization and echocardiography (cardiac <e>US</e>) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with suspected PAH underwent PC-MRI, cardiac US, and right heart catheterization. In each patient, PC-MRI was acquired by cine 2D-PC method on a 1.5 Tesla scanner, and stroke volume (SV) and pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) were assessed by using the modified Bernoulli's equation. To evaluate the agreements of SV and PASP among the three methods, correlations and limits of agreement among the three methods were statistically assessed by using the Bland-Altman's analyses. RESULTS: The correlations and limits of agreement for SV and PASP between PC-MRI and catheterization (r = 0.96, r(2) = 0.94, 1.1 +/- 6.9 mL and r = 0.94, r(2) = 0.88, -3.2 +/- 14.5 mmHg, respectively) were better than between cardiac US and catheterization (r = 0.01, r(2) &lt; 0.01, 8.9 +/- 42.1 mL and r = 0.86, r(2) = 0.72, -5.9 +/- 27.7 mmHg, respectively).

19847417,"Vesicovaginal reflux: recognition and diagnosis using ultrasound.BACKGROUND: Vaginal reflux is a functional voiding disorder seen in prepubertal girls without anatomical or neurological abnormality. When not associated with urinary tract infections (UTI), asymptomatic bacteriuria, post-void dribbling or daytime enuresis it may be considered a normal finding. OBJECTIVE: To review the radiographic features of vesicovaginal reflux based on multiple imaging modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three girls aged 11, 13 and 5 years were referred for pelvic <e>US</e> for daytime incontinence, post-void dribbling, frequency and urgency. One girl also had recurrent UTIs treated with antibiotics and was investigated for vesicoureteric reflux with US and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). All three were examined with MRI. RESULTS: Imaging appearance common to all three girls was a fluid-filled mass posterior to the bladder that disappeared after voiding. A previous VCUG in one girl had shown contrast medium refluxing into the vagina which disappeared after bladder emptying. Pelvic MRI confirmed the findings in all three girls. CONCLUSION: US examination of a distended bladder followed by a post-void study easily provides the correct diagnosis of vesicovaginal reflux by identifying the vagina as the fluid-filled mass. Treatment involves behavioural modifications. Though well known to urologists, this may be a perplexing pathology for the inexperienced trainee radiologist.",M2
19824109,"Carotid lesions in outpatients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.AIM: To ascertain whether carotid lesions are more prevalent in outpatients with incidental findings of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) at abdominal ultrasound (<e>US</e>). METHODS: One hundred and fifty-four consecutive outpatients (age range 24-90 years, both sexes) referred by general practitioners for abdominal US, and drinking less than 20 g alcohol/day, underwent carotid US for an assessment of carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) and carotid plaque prevalence. Hepatic steatosis, visceral fat thickness and subcutaneous fat thickness were also assessed at ultrasonography. RESULTS: Higher c-IMT values were found in the presence of NAFLD (90 patients), even after adjustment for indices of general and abdominal obesity and for the principal cardiovascular risk factors (0.84 +/- 0.10 mm vs 0.71 +/- 0.10 mm, P &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of carotid plaques was 57.8% in the patients with NAFLD vs 37.5% in the patients without this condition (P = 0.02). The adjusted relative risk of having carotid plaques for patients with NAFLD was 1.85 (95% CI: 1.33-2.57, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: An incidental finding of hepatic steatosis may suggest the presence of silent carotid atherosclerotic lesions.",M2
19822238,"Non-invasive evaluation of liver cirrhosis using ultrasound.Ultrasound (<e>US</e>) is essential in both assessment of the potentially cirrhotic liver and surveillance of selected patients with chronic hepatitis as liver biopsy can be misleading or inaccurate in up to 25% of cases. Various techniques are already in routine use, such as grey-scale imaging, Doppler US, and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), while newer techniques such as elastography and hepatic vein transit time (HVTT) have the potential to exclude patients without significant fibrosis or cirrhosis; however, they are operator dependent and require specific software. Grey-scale imaging may demonstrate changes, such as volume redistribution, capsule nodularity, parenchymal nodularity, and echotexture changes. The Doppler findings in the hepatic and portal veins, hepatic artery, and varices allow assessment of liver cirrhosis. However, the operator needs to be aware of limitations of these techniques. Low mechanical index CEUS plays an important role in the assessment of complications of cirrhosis, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein thrombus.

19778202,"Histological findings compared with magnetic resonance and ultrasonographic imaging in irreversible postmastectomy lymphedema: a case study.Postmastectomy edema is a current complication after axillary lymph node dissection in cases of breast cancer treatment. Staging is important in order to select those patients who can benefit from complex physical therapy (CPT). Different imaging techniques can be used to evaluate the edema. Ultrasonography (<e>US</e>) is a harmless, cheap, and easily applicable technique to visualize the dermal and subcutaneous tissue, but interpretation of the obtained images is not always evident. The aim of this study was to compare ultrasound images of irreversible edema with tissue histology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Ultrasonographic images of the edematous dermis show an homogeneous hypoechogenic dermal layer that appears on tissue histology to be less compact, due to the excess of fluid in the interstitium separating the collagen fibres and making it more transparent on light microscopy. MRI of the dermis gives a hyperintense signal, indicating the presence of fluid. In the subcutis, increase of the adipose tissue could be observed on US, MRI, and tissue histology. In the case of lymphedema, the area and perimeter of fat cells is significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased. Hypoechogenic areas near the muscle fascia are registered on US corresponding with epifascial fluid on MRI, and hyperechogenic branches are embedded within the adipose tissue, on tissue histology seen as large fibrotic septa enclosing adipose cells. MRI has a honeycomb picture corresponding with fluid bound to fibrosis.",M2

Out of 27 young male volunteers, 20 subjects were assigned to training group and seven to non-training control group. Muscle CSAs of vastus lateralis were analyzed by MRI and US before and after 21 weeks of either heavy resistance training or control period. Measured by both the US and MRI, the resistance training induced significant increases (~13-14%, P &lt; 0.001) in muscle CSA, whereas no changes were observed in control group. A high repeatability was found between the two consequent US measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC of 0.997) with standard error of measurement (SEM) of 0.38 cm(2) and smallest detectable difference of 1.1 cm(2). Validity of the US method against MRI in assessing CSA of VL produced ICC of 0.905 and SEM of 0.87 cm(2) with high limits of agreement analyzed by Bland and Altman method. However, the MRI produced systematically (10 +/- 4%, P &lt; 0.01) larger CSA values than the US method. The US showed high agreement against MRI in detecting changes in muscle CSA (ICC of 0.929, SEM of 0.94 cm(2)). The results of this study showed that the panoramic US method provides repeatable measures of a muscle CSA although MRI produced larger absolute CSA values. Moreover, this US method detects training-induced changes in muscle CSA with a comparable degree of precision to MRI.",M2

19766380,"Plasma sterilization of poly lactic acid ultrasound contrast agents: surface modification and implications for drug delivery.Poly lactic acid (PLA) ultrasound contrast agents (CA) have been developed previously in our laboratory for ultrasound (<e>US</e>) imaging, as well as surface coated with doxorubicin to create a potential targeted platform of chemotherapeutic delivery using focused US. However, we have previously found it impossible to sterilize these agents while at the same time maintaining their acoustic properties, a task that would probably require fabrication within a clean facility. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of using plasma to sterilize these CA while maintaining maximum echogenicity, a step that would greatly facilitate in vivo investigations. Effects of plasma exposure time (1, 3 and 6 min) and intensity (low-10 mA, 6.8 W; medium-15 mA, 10.5 W; and high-25 mA, 18 W) on the CAs' acoustic properties, surface morphology, zeta potential, capacity to carry chemotherapeutics and overall sterility are described. Both increases in plasma intensity and exposure time increased CA zeta potential and also significantly increased drug payload. High-intensity plasma exposure for 3 min was found to be an optimal sterilization protocol for maximal (100%) preservation of CA echogenicity. Plasma exposure resulted in sterile samples and maintained original CA enhancement of 20 dB and acoustic half-life over 75 min, while increasing CA zeta potential by 11 mV and doxorubicin loading efficiency by 10%. This study not only shows how a highly temperature- and pressure-sensitive agent can be sterilized using plasma, but also that surface modification can be used to increase surface binding of the drug.",M2
19760420,"Does CT have an additional diagnostic value over ultrasound in the evaluation of acute inflammatory neck masses in children?OBJECTIVES: We assessed the additional value of contrast-enhanced CT versus <e>US</e> for evaluation of acute cervical inflammatory masses and choosing treatment strategy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 210 files of paediatric patients admitted with an acute inflammatory neck mass from 2005 to 2008 (M:F = 108:102, mean age 4.5 years). All patients underwent diagnostic ultrasound and Doppler of the neck; CT was performed in 25 patients within 2-72 h. Clinical and radiological findings were correlated, and imaging impact on patient management was assessed. RESULTS: In the 210 patients, US provided sufficient information in 184 of 185 (99.5%) patients undergoing only US. In one patient with no sonographic evidence of collection, an abscess was drained surgically on the point of fluctuation. Fluid collections were drained in 17 patients based on US findings; inflammatory processes were managed conservatively in 164. CT provided additional information in 4 of 25 patients (16.0%), revealing airways compromise in 2 and collections in 2. CONCLUSION: US provided sufficient information about the nature, location, and extent of the inflammatory mass in 97.6% of our patients, suggesting it should be the main, and generally single, imaging technique in these patients. CT should be reserved for patients with an aggravating clinical course and suspicion of deep neck infection or airways compromise.",M2
19754280,"A proposal for a thyroid imaging reporting and data system for ultrasound features of thyroid carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Several thyroid ultrasound (TUS) findings have been associated with an increased risk for thyroid cancer; however, there is no consensus as to the format and style for reporting the results of TUS. The objective of this study was to discover the features indicative of malignancy in thyroid nodules based on TUS, generate an equation using these features that would be predictive of malignancy in thyroid nodules, and stratify the results of this equation into TUS categories reflecting the probability of malignancy. METHODS: We obtained odds ratios of TUS findings indicative of malignancy and probability of malignancy for each nodule as determined by logistic regression analysis of ultrasound (<e>US</e>) findings in 1694 patients who had US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy. We then generated an equation to predict the probability of malignancy based on TUS and developed categories ranging from lowest to highest probability of malignancy. We evaluated the reliability of this equation and the categories using cytology and histopathology information regarding malignancy in the thyroid nodules. RESULTS: We characterized 12 aspects of thyroid nodules as seen on TUS and developed an equation to predict P(us), the probability of a nodule being malignant based on these US findings. The equation was P(us) = 1/(1 + e(-z)), where e is the mathematical constant 2.71828 and z is the logit of malignant thyroid nodule. P(us) was stratified into five categories based on the probability of a nodule being malignant as indicated by the findings (TUS 1, benign; TUS 2, probably benign; TUS 3, indeterminate; TUS 4, probably malignant; TUS 5, malignant). There was a significant correlation between the cytological category and the TUS 1 through TUS 5 categories (r = 0.491, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We propose an equation to predict the probability of malignancy in thyroid nodules based on 12 features of thyroid nodules as noted on TUS. This equation, and the stratification of its results into categories, should be useful in reporting the findings of US for thyroid nodules and in guiding management decisions.",M2

19727754,"Detection of rotator cuff tears: the value of MRI following ultrasound.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the need for additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following ultrasound (<e>US</e>) in patients with shoulder pain and/or disability and to compare the accuracy of both techniques for the detection of partial-thickness and full-thickness rotator cuff tears (RCT). METHODS: In 4 years, 5,216 patients underwent US by experienced musculoskeletal radiologists. Retrospectively, patient records were evaluated if MRI and surgery were performed within 5 months of US. US and MRI findings were classified into intact cuff, partial-thickness and full-thickness RCT, and were correlated with surgical findings. RESULTS: Additional MR imaging was performed in 275 (5.2%) patients. Sixty-eight patients underwent surgery within 5 months. US and MRI correctly depicted 21 (95%) and 22 (100%) of the 22 full-thickness tears, and 8 (89%) and 6 (67%) of the 9 partial-thickness tears, respectively. The differences in performance of US and MRI were not statistically significant (p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: MRI following routine shoulder US was requested in only 5.2% of the patients. The additional value of MRI was in detecting intra-articular lesions. In patients who underwent surgery, US and MRI yielded comparably high sensitivity for detecting full-thickness RCT. US performed better in detecting partial-thickness tears, although the difference was not significant.",M2
19717887,"A comparative study of seed localization and dose calculation on pre- and post-implantation ultrasound and CT images for low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.This work investigates variation in the volume of the prostate measured at different stages through the prostate brachytherapy procedure for 30 patients treated with I-125 radioactive seeds. The implanted seeds were localized on post-implantation ultrasound (<e>US</e>) images and the effect of prostate enlargement due to edema on dose coverage for 15 patients was studied. The volume of the prostate was measured at four stages as follows: (a) 2-3 weeks prior to implantation using US imaging, (b) then at the start of the intra-operative prostate brachytherapy procedure on the day of the implant, (c) immediately post-implantation using US imaging in the operating room and (d) finally by CT imaging at nearly 4 weeks post-implantation. Comparative prostate volume studies were performed using US imaging stepper and twister modes. For the purpose of this study, the implanted seeds were localized successfully on post-implant ultrasound twister images, retrospectively. The plans using post-implant US imaging were compared with intra-operative plans on US and plans created on CT images. The prostate volume increases about 10 cm(3) on average due to edema induced by needle insertion and seed loading during implantation. The visibility of the implanted seeds on US twister images acquired post-implantation is as good as those on CT images and can be localized and used for dose calculation. The dose coverage represented by parameters such as D90 (dose covering 90% of the volume) and V100 (volume covered by 100% dose) is poorer on plans performed on post-implantation twister US studies than on the intra-operative live plan or the CT scan performed 4 weeks post-operatively. For example, the mean D90 difference on post-implantation US is lower by more than 15% than that on pre-implantation US. The volume enlargement of the prostate due to edema induced by needle insertion and seed placement has a significant effect on the quality of dosimetric coverage in brachytherapy prostate seed implants. Here, we introduced a new approach based on the use of post-implant US twister images to correct for prostate enlargement intra-operatively. Besides the ability to localize the seeds and superior soft tissue visibility, the twister US images include effects of the enlargement of the prostate gland and seed migration during the implantation procedure.",M2
19709952,"Delivery of encapsulated Doxorubicin by ultrasound-mediated size reduction of drug-loaded polymer contrast agents.Low delivery efficiency combined with systemic toxicity of traditional chemotherapy provides a need for improved chemotherapeutic delivery. Within our laboratory, we have developed polymer ultrasound contrast agents (1.2-1.8 mum in diameter) containing doxorubicin (Dox) within the shell (100-150 nm). In vivo this platform is expected to circulate through the vasculature until activated at the tumor site with external focused ultrasound (<e>US</e>). In vitro, the agent is responsive to US and when insonated at peak positive pressure amplitudes of 0.69 MPa and above, shows dramatic size reduction, eventually reaching a mean particle size of 350 nm, presumably due to fragmentation of, or gas release from the agent. The resulting Dox-polymer particles retain the drug and are small enough to pass through the leaky pores (350-400 nm) within the tumor vasculature, providing a sustained intratumoral release of chemotherapeutic as the polymer degrades. In vivo studies using a VX2 liver tumor model have shown that the combination of the agent and US results in nearly 50% less drug delivered to the nontargeted, healthy liver ( p = 0.009) and a 110% increase ( p = 0.004) in Dox delivery to the viable peripheral tissue of the tumor, relative to the uninsonated controls. This study shows how US-mediated destruction of drug-loaded polymer contrast agent can be used to deliver encapsulated drug for potential sustained release. Penetration mechanisms of these resulting particles and their ability to provide a sustained release from the tumor interstia will be explored in the future.",M2
19695653,"On the possibility of non-invasive multilayer temperature estimation using soft-computing methods.OBJECTIVE AND MOTIVATION: This work reports original results on the possibility of non-invasive temperature estimation (NITE) in a multilayered phantom by applying soft-computing methods. The existence of reliable non-invasive temperature estimator models would improve the security and efficacy of thermal therapies. These points would lead to a broader acceptance of this kind of therapies. Several approaches based on medical imaging technologies were proposed, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) being appointed as the only one to achieve the acceptable temperature resolutions for hyperthermia purposes. However, MRI intrinsic characteristics (e.g., high instrumentation cost) lead <e>us</e> to use backscattered ultrasound (BSU). Among the different BSU features, temporal echo-shifts have received a major attention. These shifts are due to changes of speed-of-sound and expansion of the medium. NOVELTY ASPECTS: The originality of this work involves two aspects: the estimator model itself is original (based on soft-computing methods) and the application to temperature estimation in a three-layer phantom is also not reported in literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this work a three-layer (non-homogeneous) phantom was developed. The two external layers were composed of (in % of weight): 86.5% degassed water, 11% glycerin and 2.5% agar-agar. The intermediate layer was obtained by adding graphite powder in the amount of 2% of the water weight to the above composition. The phantom was developed to have attenuation and speed-of-sound similar to in vivo muscle, according to the literature. BSU signals were collected and cumulative temporal echo-shifts computed. These shifts and the past temperature values were then considered as possible estimators inputs. A soft-computing methodology was applied to look for appropriate multilayered temperature estimators. The methodology involves radial-basis functions neural networks (RBFNN) with structure optimized by the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). In this work 40 operating conditions were considered, i.e. five 5-mm spaced spatial points and eight therapeutic intensities (I(SATA)): 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7 and 2.0W/cm(2). Models were trained and selected to estimate temperature at only four intensities, then during the validation phase, the best-fitted models were analyzed in data collected at the eight intensities. This procedure leads to a more realistic evaluation of the generalisation level of the best-obtained structures. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: At the end of the identification phase, 82 (preferable) estimator models were achieved. The majority of them present an average maximum absolute error (MAE) inferior to 0.5 degrees C. The best-fitted estimator presents a MAE of only 0.4 degrees C for both the 40 operating conditions. This means that the gold-standard maximum error (0.5 degrees C) pointed for hyperthermia was fulfilled independently of the intensity and spatial position considered, showing the improved generalisation capacity of the identified estimator models. As the majority of the preferable estimator models, the best one presents 6 inputs and 11 neurons. In addition to the appropriate error performance, the estimator models present also a reduced computational complexity and then the possibility to be applied in real-time. CONCLUSIONS: A non-invasive temperature estimation model, based on soft-computing technique, was proposed for a three-layered phantom. The best-achieved estimator models presented an appropriate error performance regardless of the spatial point considered (inside or at the interface of the layers) and of the intensity applied. Other methodologies published so far, estimate temperature only in homogeneous media. The main drawback of the proposed methodology is the necessity of a-priory knowledge of the temperature behavior. Data used for training and optimisation should be representative, i.e., they should cover all possible physical situations of the estimation environment.",M2

19673015,"Characterization of focal liver lesions with SonoVue-enhanced sonography: international multicenter-study in comparison to CT and MRI.AIM: To evaluate in a multicenter study whether the sonographic characterization of focal liver lesions can be improved using SonoVue-enhancement; and to compare this method with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: One hundred and thirty four patients with one focal liver lesion detected in baseline ultrasound (<e>US</e>) were examined with conventional US, contrast-enhanced US (n = 134), contrast-enhanced CT (n = 115) and/or dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (n = 70). The lesions were classified as malignant, benign or indeterminate and the type of lesion was determined. The final diagnosis based on the combined information of all imaging examinations, clinical information and histology (n = 32) was used. Comparisons were made to see whether the addition of contrast-enhanced US led to the improvement of the characterization of doubtful focal liver lesions. RESULTS: In comparison with unenhanced US, SonoVue markedly improves sensitivity and specificity for the characterization (malignant/benign) of focal liver lesions. In comparison with CT and/or dynamic MRI, SonoVue-enhanced sonography applied for characterization of focal liver lesions was 30.2% more sensitive in the recognition of malignancy and 16.1% more specific in the exclusion of malignancy and overall 22.9% more accurate. In the subgroup with confirmative histology available (n = 30), sensitivity was 95.5% (CEUS), 72.2% (CT) and 81.8% (MRI), and specificity was 75.0% (CEUS), 37.5% (CT) and 42.9% (MRI). The sensitivity and specificity of CEUS for the identification of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and hemangiomas was 100% and 87%, resulting in an accuracy of 94.5%. CONCLUSION: SonoVue-enhanced sonography emerges as the most sensitive, most specific and thus most accurate imaging modality for the characterization of focal liver lesions.",M2
19662419,"Findings and limitations of focused ultrasound as a possible screening test in stable adult patients with blunt abdominal trauma: a Greek study.Our objective is to underline the place of FAST (focus assessment by sonography for trauma) ultrasonography (<e>US</e>) in the investigation of blunt abdominal trauma. We retrospectively examined the ultrasound findings in 1,999 haemodynamically stable adult patients. These people were admitted to the emergency room (ER) for possible blunt abdominal trauma. All were stable at admission and a FAST ultrasound examination was made. Initial findings were compared with the clinical course after at least 24 h of observation time and CT results. Among the 1,999 US examinations, abnormalities were found in 109 (5.5%) cases. Among them, 102 had free peritoneal fluid, and in 58 examinations, ruptures, lacerations or haematomas were demonstrated. Despite its limitations, such as in cases involving uncooperative patients, excessive bowel gas, obesity and empty bladder, the FAST technique seems to be an accurate method to evaluate the possibility of abdominal blunt trauma in stable patients. Because of the high negative predictive value of the FAST technique in stable patients with blunt abdominal trauma, we recommend that a stable patient with negative ultrasound results at admission remain under close observation for at least 12 or preferably 24 h before being discharged.",M2
19657654,"Ultrasound demonstration of distal biceps tendon bifurcation: normal and abnormal findings.We demonstrate the <e>US</e> appearance of the distal biceps tendon bifurcation in normal cadavers and volunteers and in those affected by various disease processes. Three cadaveric specimens, 30 normal volunteers, and 75 patients were evaluated by means of US. Correlative MR imaging was obtained in normal volunteers and patients. In all cases US demonstrated the distal biceps tendon shaped by two separate tendons belonging to the short and long head of the biceps brachii muscle. Four patients had a complete rupture of the distal insertion of the biceps with retraction of the muscle belly. Four patients had partial tear of the distal biceps tendon with different US appearance. In two patients the partial tear involved the short head of the biceps brachii tendon, while in the other two patients, the long head was involved. Correlative MR imaging is also presented both in normal volunteers and patients. US changed the therapeutic management in the patients with partial tears involving the LH of the biceps. This is the first report in which ultrasound considers the distal biceps tendon bifurcation in detail. Isolated tears of one of these components can be identified by US. Knowledge of the distal biceps tendon bifurcation ultrasonographic anatomy and pathology has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",M2
19657645,"Differential diagnosis between benign and malignant gallbladder diseases with real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound.The value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in differential diagnosis between benign and malignant gallbladder diseases was investigated. Thirty-three patients with gallbladder carcinomas and 47 with benign gallbladder diseases underwent CEUS. The lesion enhancement time, enhancement extent, pattern, dynamic change of enhancement and the intactness of gallbladder wall were evaluated. In the early phase at CEUS, hyper-, iso-, hypo-, and non-enhancement were found in 84.8% (28/33), 9.1% (3/33), 6.1% (2/33), and 0% (0/33) of gallbladder carcinomas, and 70.3% (33/47), 17.0% (8/47), 2.1% (1/47), and 10.6% (5/47) of benign diseases (p &gt; 0.05). Hyper-enhancement or iso-enhancement in the early phase and then fading out to hypo-enhancement within 35 s after contrast agent administration was found in 90.9% (30/33) of carcinomas and 17.0% (8/47) of benign lesions (p &lt; 0.001). Destruction of the gallbladder wall intactness was absent in benign diseases, whereas it was present in 28 (84.8%) of the 33 carcinomas (p &lt; 0.001). Destruction of gallbladder wall intactness on CEUS yielded the highest capability in differential diagnosis, with sensitivity, specificity, and Youden's index of 84.8% (28/33), 100% (47/47), and 0.85, respectively. Conventional <e>US</e> made correct original diagnoses in 55 (68.8%) patients, whereas CEUS in 77 (96.3%). Thus, CEUS is useful in differential diagnosis between malignant and benign gallbladder diseases.",M2
19657636,"Validation of <e>US</e> as a first-line diagnostic test for assessment of pediatric ileocolic intussusception.BACKGROUND: From the early 1980s onward, US has been considered a possible primary modality to assess patients for ileocolic intussusception. Since 2001, our institution has routinely used US to assess patients for ileocolic intussusception. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed 7 years of institutional experience to assess the value of US as a primary diagnostic test for intussusception. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was IRB-approved. From 1 January 2001 through 16 December 2007 814 US examinations for intussusception were performed in children aged 10 years and younger. Clinical records and radiological reports were reviewed for each patient, and cases were classified as true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, or false-negative. RESULTS: Of the 814 US examinations, 112 (13.8%) were interpreted as positive for intussusception, and of these, 96 were confirmed by enema, 1 was confirmed by surgery, and 15 (13.4%) were false-positive. Of the 814 examinations, 700 (85.9%) were interpreted as negative for intussusception, and of these, 698 (99.7%) were true-negative, and 2 were false-negative. Less than 1% of studies were nondiagnostic. The overall sensitivity of US for detecting intussusception was 97.9% and specificity was 97.8%. The positive predictive value of the test was 86.6% and the negative predictive value was 99.7%. CONCLUSION: US is a sensitive and specific test for detecting ileocolic intussusception and should be utilized as a first-line examination for assessment of possible pediatric intussusception.",M2

19644628,"Utility of abdominal ultrasonography in HIV patients.INTRODUCTION: Various diseases associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are often difficult to diagnose. A poor immune response, atypical presentations and opportunistic pathologies all contribute to this difficulty. We tried to evaluate the utility of routine abdominal ultrasonography (<e>US</e>) in new and follow-up HIV cases, and compared the results among those with a clinical need for US and those where US was performed as a routine screening. METHODS: 150 consecutive seropositive patients were subdivided into four groups depending on the necessity of abdominal US on the initial workup, i.e. Group A (38 patients) or B (112 patients), and whether they were newly-diagnosed HIV patients or follow-up patients, i.e. Group X (62 patients) or Y (88 patients), giving us subgroups, AX (22 patients), AY (16 patients), BX (40 patients) and BY (72 patients). RESULTS: The prevalence of significant US findings was higher in those with CD4 less than 200 cells/ml (77.8 percent) compared to those with CD4 200-500 cells/ml and CD4 more than 500 cells/ml (65.5 percent and 37 percent, respectively). 24 out of 38 patients with clinical indications and 71 out of 112 patients without any obvious clinical need for US, had positive findings on US, the majority of which had a major therapeutic impact. CONCLUSION: We conclude that abdominal US is a simple and cost-effective tool in resource-poor countries like India, where HIV care is becoming more and more important.",M2
19644627,"The usefulness of early ultrasonography, electroencephalography and clinical parameters in predicting adverse outcomes in asphyxiated term infants.INTRODUCTION: The early identification of asphyxiated infants at high risk of adverse outcomes and the early selection of those who might benefit from neuroprotective therapies are required. A prospective observational study was conducted to determine if there were any early clinical, neuroimaging or neurophysiological parameters that might predict the outcome in term newborns with asphyxia. METHODS: 44 term newborns with acute asphyxia had a cranial ultrasonography (<e>US</e>), electroencephalography (EEG) and clinical examination performed between three and eight hours of life to determine the parameters that might predict outcome. US findings were classified as normal or abnormal (ventricular dilatation or compression and/or focal/diffuse echogenicities). EEG background activity was classified into two categories: normal/mildly abnormal/intermediate, or severely abnormal (low voltage activity or  suppression-burst ). An intrapartum score (based on graded abnormalities of foetal heart monitoring, umbilical arterial base deficit and five-minute Apgar score) and a hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) score (based on graded abnormalities of the neurological and respiratory status at 3-8 hours of life) was also obtained. RESULTS: At one year of life, eight infants had died, six had defaulted follow-up, five had major impairment, two minor impairment and 23 were normal. On univariate analysis, poor outcome (death or major impairment) was associated with abnormal cranial US, severely abnormal EEG and a high HIE score (greater than or equal to 15). The positive predictive value was 54.5, 100 and 100 percent, respectively, while the negative predictive value was 93.8, 80.6 and 80.6 percent, respectively. Combining these factors did not improve the predictive values. CONCLUSION: There was no added advantage in combining EEG or US parameters over a clinical neurological scoring system alone in predicting the outcome of asphyxiated term newborns.",M2
19630975,"Contributions of myofascial pain in diagnosis and treatment of shoulder pain. A randomized control trial.BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff tendinopathy and subacromial impingement syndrome present complex patomechanical situations, frequent difficulties in clinical diagnosis and lack of effectiveness in treatment. Based on clinical experience, we have therefore considered the existence of another pathological entity as the possible origin of pain and dysfunction. The hypothesis of this study is to relate subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) with myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), since myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) cause pain, functional limitation, lack of coordination and alterations in quality of movement, even prior to a tendinopathy. MTrPs can coexist with any degenerative subacromial condition. If they are not taken into consideration, they could perpetuate and aggravate the problem, hindering diagnosis and making the applied treatments ineffective.The aims and methods of this study are related with providing evidence of the relationship that may exist between this condition and MPS in the diagnosis and treatment of rotator cuff tendonitis and/or SIS. METHOD/DESIGN: A descriptive transversal study will be made to find the correlation between the diagnosis of SIS and rotator cuff tendonitis, positive provocation test responses, the existence of active MTrPs and the results obtained with ultrasonography (<e>US</e>) and Magnetic Renonance Imaging (MRI). A randomized double blinded clinical trial will be carried out in experimental conditions: A Protocolized treatment based on active and passive joint repositioning, stabilization exercises, stretching of the periarticular shoulder muscles and postural reeducation. B. The previously described protocolized treatment, with the addition of dry needling applied to active MTrPs with the purpose of isolating the efficacy of dry needling in treatment. DISCUSSION: This study aims to provide a new vision of shoulder pain, from the perspective of MPS. This syndrome can, by itself, account for shoulder pain and dysfunction, although it can coexist with real conditions involving the tendons. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Number: 30907460.",M2
19629463,"Imaging of congenital mesoblastic nephroma with pathological correlation.BACKGROUND: There are a variety of imaging findings for congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN) and two main pathological variants: classic and cellular. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether imaging findings in children can predict the likely pathological variant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed imaging in children with pathology-proven CMN. Imaging findings correlated with gross and histological appearance. RESULTS: In 15 boys and 15 girls with CMN, <e>US</e> was performed in 27, CT in 19, and MRI in 7. Cystic components were readily identified on US; central hemorrhage was better differentiated on CT. MRI demonstrated high sensitivity for both. Histology confirmed classic CMN in 13 children, cellular CMN in 14 and  mixed  CMN in 3. Age at presentation was significantly higher in children with the cellular variant. Of 15 solid or predominantly solid tumors and 10 lesions with a hypoechoic ring, 12 and 7, respectively, had pathology consistent with classic CMN. In contrast, five of seven with intratumoral hemorrhage and all with a large cystic/necrotic component had pathology consistent with the cellular variant. CONCLUSION: The imaging appearance of CMN is often determined by the pathological type of tumor. Findings suggestive of the classic variant include a peripheral hypoechoic ring or large solid component. In comparison, cystic/necrotic change and hemorrhage is much more common in cellular CMN.",M2

19622125,"Use of high-resolution ultrasound to monitor the healing of leg ulcers: a prospective single-center study.BACKGROUND: The quality and extent of leg ulcer healing in deeper skin layers remains poorly defined using standard visual inspection alone. High-resolution ultrasound (HR-<e>US</e>) offers a non-invasive, quantitative and objective assessment of dimensional and structural changes deep within the wound. METHODS: In a prospective, single-center study, healing of chronic, treatment-resistant leg ulcers was monitored by standard photography and HR-US. RESULTS: Twenty patients with 22 ulcers were enrolled. After study entry, treatment comprised continuation of conventional management (n=4) or application of Apligraf (n=17) or Thiersch (n=1). All ulcers receiving a graft were classified as 'clinically healed' by visual inspection within a maximum of 5 weeks. With conventional management, closure required a period of several months in three out of four cases. After covering the ulcer with Apligraf, the skin reconditioned, resulting in fair skin color and a smooth skin surface in all but one case. HR-US images, however, revealed large subepidermal deficits of elastic and collagenous fibers at the time of 'clinical healing' in 14/18 engrafted ulcers, findings that are strongly indicative of a weakened skin scaffolding. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the healing process for chronic ulcers can be monitored with both standard visual inspection (photography) and HR-US to allow early intervention.",M2
19605664,"<e>US</e> artifacts.Image artifacts are commonly encountered in clinical ultrasonography (US) and may be a source of confusion for the interpreting physician. Some artifacts may be avoidable and arise secondary to improper scanning technique. Other artifacts are generated by the physical limitations of the modality. US artifacts can be understood with a basic appreciation of the physical properties of the ultrasound beam, the propagation of sound in matter, and the assumptions of image processing. US artifacts arise secondary to errors inherent to the ultrasound beam characteristics, the presence of multiple echo paths, velocity errors, and attenuation errors. The beam width, side lobe, reverberation, comet tail, ring-down, mirror image, speed displacement, refraction, attenuation, shadowing, and increased through-transmission artifacts are encountered routinely in clinical practice. Recognition of these artifacts is important because they may be clues to tissue composition and aid in diagnosis. The ability to recognize and remedy potentially correctable US artifacts is important for image quality improvement and optimal patient care.",M2
19605658,"Müllerian duct anomalies and mimics in children and adolescents: correlative intraoperative assessment with clinical imaging.Müllerian duct anomalies (MDAs) are congenital entities that result from nondevelopment, defective vertical or lateral fusion, or resorption failure of the müllerian (paramesonephric) ducts. MDAs are common, although the majority are asymptomatic, and have been classified by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine according to clinical manifestations, prognosis, and treatment. Accurate diagnosis of an MDA is essential, since the management approach varies depending on the type of malformation. In females, when a müllerian duct becomes obstructed, the patient may present with an abdominal mass and dysmenorrhea. If the patient is not treated in a timely fashion, the consequences can be severe, extending even to infertility. When an MDA is suspected, ultrasonography (<e>US</e>) should be performed initially to delineate any abnormalities in the genital tract. However, US cannot help identify the type of MDA. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable technique for noninvasive evaluation of the female pelvic anatomy and accurate MDA classification. If obstruction is present, surgical correction of the MDA may be required, and further counseling of the patient with regard to reproductive possibilities becomes important.

19593590,"The efficacy of ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in predicting vesicoureteral reflux in children below the age of 2 years with their first febrile urinary tract infection.We evaluated the efficacy of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and ultrasound (<e>US</e>) in comparison with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in predicting vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children below the age of 2 years. Medical records and radiologic studies of children (&lt;2 years) suffering their first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) between January 2001 and May 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of US and DMSA scans in diagnosing VUR. Among 220 children with their first febrile UTI, VUR was detected in 67 (30.4%). The detection rate of VUR by US was 41.7% and 86% in the low (I, II) and high grade (III~IV) groups, respectively. Detection rate of VUR by DMSA scan was 37.5% and 88.4% in the low and high grade groups, respectively. Combining US and DMSA scan, we found that the detection rate of high grade VUR was 95.3% and that of low grade was 62.5%. During follow up, most of the low grade VURs with normal DMSA and US scans resolved or were downgraded. Most high grade VURs could be detected by US and DMSA scan, but the prediction rate was not as high in low grade VURs. However, we can anticipate spontaneous improvement without complications in patients with either low or high grade reflux and negative findings on US and DMSA scan.",M2
19593567,"Severity of Carpal tunnel syndrome assessed with high frequency ultrasonography.Although nerve conduction study (NCS) is the method most frequently used in daily clinical practice to confirm clinical diagnosis of Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), ultrasonographic (<e>US</e>) measurement of the median nerve cross-sectional area is both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of CTS. Moreover, an algorithm evaluating CTS severity based on CSA of median nerve was suggested. This study is aimed to investigate the clinical usefulness of this algorithm in assessing CTS severity. The patients underwent a full clinical examination, including Tinel and Phalen test, and questioned about symptoms and the secondary causes of CTS. All of the patients refilled a Turkish version Levine Boston Carpal tunnel syndrome questionnaire (BQ) and the visual analog scale for pain (VAS 0-100 mm) A MyLab 70 US system (Esaote Biomedica, Genoa, Italy) equipped with a broadband 6-18 MHz linear transducer was used for US examination. The cross-sectional area of the median nerve was measured at the proximal inlet of the carpal tunnel (US cut-off points that discriminate between different grades of CTS severity as 10.0-13.0 mm(2) for mild symptoms, 13.0-15.0 mm(2) moderate symptoms and &gt;15.0 mm(2) for severe patients). Nerve conduction studies were carried out, and severity of electrophysiological CTS impairment was reported as normal, mild, moderate, severe and extreme. The agreement between NCS and US in showing CTS severity (normal, mild, moderate and severe) was calculated with Cohen's kappa coefficient. Ninety-nine wrists of 54 patients (male/female: 4/50) were included in the study. Mean ages of patients were (+/-SD) 43.3 +/- 11 years. Forty-nine patients had idiopathic CTS, whereas five had secondary CTS (4 had diabetes mellitus and 1 had hypothyroidism). Symptoms were bilateral in 45 patients (83.3%). There were statistical differences between the groups according to electrophysiologic severity scale in terms of age (P &lt; 0.001), body-mass index (P = 0.034), VAS (P = 0.014), Boston symptom severity (P = 0.013) and CSA of median nerve (P &lt; 0.001). The identification of CTS severity showed substantial agreement (Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.619) between the US and NCS. Also the four groups based on US CTS severity classification were significantly different in VAS (P = 0.017) and Boston symptom severity (P = 0.021). The median nerve swelling detected by calculation of the CSA reflects in itself the degree of nerve damage as expressed by the clinical picture. In addition to CTS diagnosis, sonographic measurement of CSA could also give additional information about severity of median nerve involvement. Using of US may cost-effectively reduce the number of NCS in patients with suspected CTS.",M2
19568463,"Imperforate anus: determination of type using transperineal ultrasonography.OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess the usefulness of transperineal ultrasonography (<e>US</e>) for the determination of imperforate anus (IA) type. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2004, 46 of 193 patients with an IA underwent transperineal US prior to corrective surgery. Sonographic findings were reviewed to identify the presence of internal fistulas and to determine  distal rectal pouch to perineum (P-P)  distances. IA types were determined based on the sonographic findings, and the diagnostic accuracy of transperineal US was evaluated based on surgical findings. RESULTS: Of the 46 patients, 17 patients were surgically confirmed as having a high-type IA, three patients were confirmed as having an intermediate-type IA and 26 patients were confirmed as having a low-type IA. The IA type was correctly diagnosed by the use of transperineal US in 39 of the 46 patients (85%). In 14 of the 17 patients with a high-type IA, internal fistulas were correctly identified. All cases with a P-P distance &gt; 16 mm were high-type IAs and all cases with a P-P distance &lt; 5 mm were low-type IAs. CONCLUSION: Transperineal US is a good diagnostic modality for the identification of internal fistulas in cases of high-type IA and for defining the IA level.",M2
19566324,"Millimeter-resolution acousto-optic quantitative imaging in a tissue model system.We have investigated the application of ultrasound modulated coherent light for quantitative determination of the ratio of dye concentrations and total concentration of absorbers in a blood vessel-mimicking sample. A 3-mm-diam tube containing the mixture of dyes inside an Intralipid-based gel with optical properties similar to tissue was interrogated by two different laser wavelengths in combination with intense microsecond ultrasound bursts. The use of calibration curves allowed <e>us</e> to extract quantitative information on the ratio of dye concentrations with the accuracy of better than 15%, as well as on the total concentration. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility to obtain a quantitative 3-D map of the absorbing structure with a spatial resolution of better than 3 mm. These findings give an outlook to apply this technique for noninvasive 3-D mapping of oxygen saturation and total concentration of hemoglobin in tissue.",M2
19556803,"Evaluation of the hemodynamic status of focal hepatic lesions 20 mm or less in diameter by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography using Sonazoid.OBJECTIVE: To clarify the validity of the evaluation of the hemodynamics of hepatic lesions &lt; or =20 mm in diameter using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CE-<e>US</e>) with Sonazoid. METHODS: Sixty-two hepatic lesions in 55 patients with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus were studied. We evaluated by quantitative analysis the time intensity curve (TIC) on hepatic lesion and parenchyma in the early vascular phase and Kupffer imaging in the post-vascular phase. RESULTS: TIC patterns were classified into those with a maximum slope (Max slope) steeper in the hepatic lesion than in the parenchyma (Pattern I), those with a Max slope similar in the hepatic lesion and parenchyma (Pattern II), and those with a Max slope gentler in the hepatic lesion than in the parenchyma (Pattern III). The blood flow was considered to be higher, the blood flow velocity to be faster, and the contrast agent to reach the lesion more rapidly in Pattern I lesions than in the hepatic parenchyma. Pattern III lesions showed that the velocity of arterial blood influx was slow. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested the possibility that the TIC allows a detailed evaluation of the hemodynamics of hepatic lesions.",M2
19551379,"Ultrasound of the hands and feet for rheumatological disorders: influence on clinical diagnostic confidence and patient management.PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to quantify the impact that ultrasound (<e>US</e>) of the hands and feet has on the rheumatologists' diagnostic confidence and on patient management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were 62 consecutive referrals from two rheumatologists for US of the hands and/or feet for this prospective controlled observational study. Measurements of diagnostic confidence for both specific clinical findings as well as overall diagnosis using a Likert scale were made both before and after the US examination in each case. Proposed management was also recorded before US and then with the benefit of the US result. McNemar's test was performed to determine differences in diagnostic certainty and proposed management before and after US. RESULTS: The physician certainty for specific clinical findings increased significantly following US for synovitis (9.7 vs 38.7%), tenosynovitis (9.7 vs 46.8%), erosions (1.6 vs 58.1%), enthesitis (50.0 vs 83.9%) and other (53.2 vs 77.4%). The physician certainty for overall diagnosis increased significantly for seronegative arthritis (46.8 vs 61.3%), inflammatory osteoarthritis (46.8 vs 87.1%), and primary osteoarthritis (46.8 vs 73.0%). A total of 88.7% of patients had disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs as a proposed management option before US vs 48.4% after US. Before US, 4.8% of patients had non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug as a proposed management option versus 45.2% after US. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound of the hands and/or feet significantly influenced the rheumatologists' diagnostic confidence in specific clinical findings and management plans.",M2
19551345,"Detection of focal liver lesions: from the subjectivity of conventional ultrasound to the objectivity of volume ultrasound.PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to establish the reliability of automated volumetric liver scans in detecting focal liver lesions by evaluating the degree of agreement between conventional and volume ultrasound (<e>US</e>) examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a period of 3 months, we prospectively studied 100 consecutive patients (36 men and 64 women; age range 15-87 years; mean age 63 years) referred to our institute for US imaging of the liver. Volumetric acquisition of the liver was achieved with a 3D transducer (2.0-5.0 MHz) and a Logiq 9 US scanner. All patients underwent both 2- and 3D US studies performed by two expert radiologists. Volumetric acquisitions were subsequently reviewed by the second radiologist, who was blinded to the first radiologist's report. Three categories were established: 1=presence of focal liver lesions; 2=doubtful finding; 3=absence of focal liver lesions. Concordance between volume US and conventional US was calculated by using the k statistic. RESULTS: Out of 100 patients examined, 39 were found to be affected by focal liver lesions. All volume US examinations were technically adequate, allowing exploration of all hepatic sectors, except for five cases that were marred by major respiratory motion artefacts. Conventional and volume US identified the same number of focal liver lesions, with the exception of four cases of doubtful findings at volume US. Concordance between automated volume US and conventional US of the liver was high (k=0.92). CONCLUSIONS: The identification of focal liver lesions on automated volume US is possible, and the examination shows a high level of concordance with conventional US.",M2
19549014,"Financial impact of emergency department ultrasound.OBJECTIVES: There is limited information on the financial implications of an emergency department ultrasound (ED <e>US</e>) program. The authors sought to perform a fiscal analysis of an integrated ED US program. METHODS: A retrospective review of billing data was performed for fiscal year (FY) 2007 for an urban academic ED with an ED US program. The ED had an annual census of 80,000 visits and 1,101 ED trauma activations. The ED is a core teaching site for a 4-year emergency medicine (EM) residency, has 35 faculty members, and has 24-hour availability of all radiology services including formal US. ED US is utilized as part of evaluation of all trauma activations and for ED procedures. As actual billing charges and reimbursement rates are institution-specific and proprietary information, relative value units (RVUs) and reimbursement based on the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) 2007 fee schedule (adjusted for fixed diagnosis-related group [DRG] payments and bad debt) was used to determine revenue generated from ED US. To estimate potential volume, assumptions were made on improvement in documentation rate for diagnostic scans (current documentation rates based on billed volume versus diagnostic studies in diagnostic image database), with no improvements assumed for procedural ED US. Expenses consist of three components-capital costs, training costs, and ongoing operational costs-and were determined by institutional experience. Training costs were considered sunken expenses by this institution and were thus not included in the original return on investment (ROI) calculation, although for this article a second ROI calculation was done with training cost estimates included. For the purposes of analysis, certain key assumptions were made. We utilized a collection rate of 45% and hospitalization rates (used to adjust for fixed DRG payments) of 33% for all diagnostic scans, 100% for vascular access, and 10% for needle placement. An optimal documentation rate of 95% was used to estimate potential revenue. RESULTS: In FY 2007, 486 limited echo exams of abdomen (current procedural terminology [CPT] 76705) and 480 limited echo cardiac exams were performed (CPT 93308) while there were 78 exams for US-guided vascular access (CPT 76937) and 36 US-guided needle placements when performing paracentesis, thoracentesis, or location of abscess for drainage (CPT 76492). Applying the 2007 CMS fee schedule and above assumptions, the revenue generated was 578 RVUs and $35,541 ($12,934 in professional physician fees and $22,607 in facility fees). Assuming optimal documentation rates for diagnostic ED US scans, ED US could have generated 1,487 RVUs and $94,593 ($33,953 in professional physician fees and $60,640 in facility fees). Program expenses include an initial capital expense (estimated at $120,000 for two US machines) and ongoing operational costs ($68,640 per year to cover image quality assurance review, continuing education, and program maintenance). Based on current revenue, there would be an annual operating loss, and thus an ROI cannot be calculated. However, if potential revenue is achieved, the annual operating income will be $22,846 per year with an ROI of 4.9 years to break even with initial investment. CONCLUSIONS: Determining an ROI is a required procedure for any business plan for establishing an ED US program. Our analysis demonstrates that an ED US program that captures charges for trauma and procedural US and achieves the potential billing volume breaks even in less than 5 years, at which point it would generate a positive margin.",M2
19547961,"Ultrasonography and clinical findings in children with epididymitis, with and without associated lower urinary tract abnormalities.BACKGROUND: Epididymitis is most commonly idiopathic but can also be associated with urinary tract abnormalities (UTAs). The distinctive clinical and imaging findings of children with epididymitis and underlying UTAs are not known. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and imaging findings in children with epididymitis and the association with UTAs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group included all children evaluated for epididymitis confirmed by scrotal <e>US</e> in a 6-year period. The clinical and imaging findings and disease recurrence were compared between children with and without UTAs. RESULTS: A total of 47 boys (mean/SD 9.61/4.40 years, range 0.1 to 17.1 years) met the entry criteria, of whom 17 had UTAs. The most common UTAs were hypospadias, neurogenic bladder, and functional bladder abnormality (six each). Age at presentation and likelihood of testicular swelling or hydrocele was not different between children with and without UTAs. Marked epididymal swelling was more common in children with UTAs (9/17, 53%) than in those without UTAs (5/30, 17%; P=0.02), as was recurrent epididymitis (with UTAs, 9/17, 53%; without UTAs, 5/30, 17%; P=0.02). Chronic epididymitis (five children), presentation with scrotal mass (four), and epididymal abscess (two) occurred only in children with UTAs. CONCLUSION: Children with epididymitis who have UTAs are more likely to present with marked epididymal swelling, develop recurrent disease, and have a more protracted course.",M2
19543893,"Supraspinatus tendon tears: comparison of 3D <e>US</e> and MR arthrography with surgical correlation.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare the diagnostic reliability of 3D US with MR arthrography in diagnosing supraspinatus tendon tears, with arthroscopic findings used as the standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study 50 patients who later underwent arthroscopic surgery of the rotator cuff were examined pre-operatively by 3D US with MR arthrography. The presence or absence of a full- or partial-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear and the tear size as demonstrated by each imaging and arthroscopy was recorded. The tear size was divided into three grades: small (&lt;1 cm), medium (1-3 cm), and large (&gt;3 cm). RESULTS: The arthroscopic diagnosis was a full-thickness tear in 40 patients, partial-thickness tears in 5, and intact supraspinatus tendon in 5. 3D US correctly diagnosed 35 out of 40 full-thickness tears and MR arthrography 39 out of 40 full-thickness tears. Regarding partial-thickness tears, 3D US underestimated 2 cases as no tear and overestimated 1 case as a full-thickness tear. MR arthrography underestimated 1 case as a partial-thickness tear and overestimated 2 cases as full-thickness and partial-thickness tears respectively. 3D US and MR arthrography yield a sensitivity for full-thickness tears of 87.5% and 97.5% with specificity of 90.0% and 90.0%. Based on the grading system, 3D US measurements correctly predicted the tear size of 23 (65.7%) of the 35 full-thickness tears and MR arthrography 30 (75.0%) of the 39 full-thickness tears. CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional ultrasound seems to be a promising imaging modality comparable to MR arthrography for the assessment of the supraspinatus tendon tears.",M2
19540514,"Omental infarction in children.OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical presentation, radiologic features, management, and outcome in children diagnosed with omental infarction. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with omental infarction in a tertiary care pediatric emergency department. Images and reports of the radiologic investigations were re-examined by a staff radiologist and analyzed for sensitivity. RESULTS: A diagnosis of omental infarction was made in 19 children (mean age, 9.3 +/- 3.5 years). The presentation was acute right lower quadrant pain in 47% of the children and associated gastrointestinal symptoms in 63%. The sensitivity of abdominal ultrasound (<e>US</e>) to detect omental infarction at our institution was 64%, and the sensitivity of abdominal computed tomography was 90%. Fourteen children were treated conservatively without complications after an accurate diagnosis of omental infarction done by imaging examination. Only 5 children underwent surgery based on clinical suspicion of appendicitis. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of omental infarction by abdominal US appears to prevent unjustified surgical procedures and reduce the length of hospital stay.",M2
19533635,"Median nerve ultrasonography in carpal tunnel syndrome: findings from two laboratories.Ultrasonographic (<e>US</e>) enlargement of the median nerve at the wrist is known to be consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), although the effects of different measurement techniques, equipment, and patient populations remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the similarities and differences of US findings in CTS between two electromyography (EMG) laboratories. In 2006 and 2007, US measurements of the median nerve were recorded independently and statistically analyzed in patients with CTS at two EMG laboratories (Duke University, Durham, NC, USA, and Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy). Patient age, median nerve area in the forearm, and neurophysiologic score did not differ significantly between the two laboratories. The North Carolina group had a larger median nerve area at the wrist and wrist-to-forearm ratio than the Italian group, although both were elevated in reference to established values for the diagnosis of CTS. Median nerve US is less susceptible to differences between laboratories than previously thought, permitting greater generalization of findings.",M2
19527364,"Role of ultrasound in the assessment of nodular thyroid disease.The role for ultrasound (<e>US</e>) in the assessment of nodular thyroid disease has increased in recent years. This expanded role has been highlighted in recent consensus guidelines on the management of nodular thyroid disease. In this review, we address the potential roles for US in assessing thyroid nodules and review these recent guidelines. In particular, we review the evidence that US characteristics of thyroid nodules can predict the risk of malignancy. A predominantly solid nodule, hypoechogenicity, microcalcification, macrocalcification, ill-defined margins, intranodular vascularity, and taller-than-wide shape have all been associated with increased risk of malignancy, but no single US characteristic is sufficiently sensitive or specific to exclude or diagnose malignancy by itself. However, the use of combinations of US characteristics to stratify nodules into high and low risk for malignancy appears a promising strategy. Unselected nodules without any suspicious US features have a low risk of malignancy (&lt;2%), whereas malignancy rates are much higher in nodules with at least two suspicious features. Recent guidelines endorse this approach of using combinations of US features to guide nodule selection for fine needle aspiration.",M2
19525508,"Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms using a dedicated portable ultrasound system: early results.AIMS: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are often diagnosed at time of (impending) rupture leading to a dramatic increase of morbidity and mortality. A simple screening device might be the key solution for widespread AAA screening. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a new portable ultrasound scanner (Aortascan BVI 9600) developed for automatic AAA detection. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 150 patients with presumed aneurysmatic peripheral atherosclerotic disease were included in the study. Patients were first scanned with conventional ultrasound (<e>US</e>), serving as reference technique. An infra-renal abdominal aorta diameter of &gt; or =30 mm was defined as an AAA. Hereafter, the aorta was scanned using the Aortascan BVI 9600. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0 statistical software. Abdominal aortic aneurysms were detected with conventional US in 78 (52%) patients, compared with 74 (49%) AAA's detected with Aortascan BVI 9600. The Aortascan BVI 9600 demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 90, 94, 95, and 89%, respectively, in the detection of AAA's. CONCLUSION: The Aortascan BVI 9600 automatically detects the aortic diameter with a 90% sensitivity without the need for a trained operator. Because of these unique capabilities, it can be used for AAA screening outside the hospital.",M2
19508988,"Effect of signal intensity from the accumulated microbubbles in the liver for differentiation of idiopathic portal hypertension from liver cirrhosis.PURPOSE: To examine the possibility of using contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (<e>US</e>) to differentiate idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) from cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an institutional review board-approved prospective study with written informed consent. The study consisted of 23 patients (mean age, 60 years +/- 11; range, 37-85 years) with biopsy-proved cirrhosis, 10 patients (mean age, 65 years +/- 8; range, 51-78 years) with IPH, and 27 control subjects (mean age, 46 years +/- 17; range, 26-82 years) without any focal hepatic lesions or portal vein thrombosis. The patients underwent contrast-enhanced US for the observation of the right liver lobe. The time of the onset of contrast enhancement in the right hepatic artery and right portal vein was examined at vascular phase under continuous low-power emission, and signal intensity differences (in decibels) by using instantaneous high-power emission in the liver parenchyma were analyzed at late phase (15 minutes). Interobserver variability was quantified as coefficients of variation. RESULTS: Onset time of contrast enhancement in the right portal vein was significantly longer for both IPH (22 sec +/- 3.9, P = .0035) and cirrhosis (19.3 sec +/- 4.7, P = .04) patients than for control subjects (17 sec +/- 3.3), with no significant difference in the onset time in the right hepatic artery. Images obtained in both IPH patients (21.2 dB +/- 1.4) and control subjects (22.1 dB +/- 2.2) had significantly higher signal intensity differences than those obtained in cirrhosis patients (13.8 dB +/- 2.8, P &lt; .0001), with no significant difference between images of IPH patients and control subjects. Signal intensity differences of more than 18 dB had 100% sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis in IPH patients and control subjects. Interobserver variability for signal intensity differences was 8.7%. CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced US may offer the possibility for a simple, easy, and noninvasive diagnosis of IPH.",M2
19506847,"Sonographic features of neonatal mastitis and breast abscess.BACKGROUND: Neonatal mastitis and neonatal breast abscess are uncommon. Although well described in the pediatric and surgical literature, there is a paucity of reports describing their sonographic features. OBJECTIVE: To describe and illustrate the sonographic features of neonatal mastitis and neonatal breast abscess. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical database of a large children's health-care center from 2000 through 2008 for patients presenting in the first 8 weeks of life with mastitis. The findings were correlated with clinical presentation and course, laboratory findings and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Four neonates (three girls and one boy) presented with mastitis. They all had prominent breast buds on the affected side with poorly defined margins, slightly more echogenic focally or diffusely compared to normal with hyperemia on color flow Doppler <e>US</e>. The surrounding subcutaneous tissue was thick and echogenic. Two abscesses presented as avascular areas without color flow on Doppler US, subtly increased through-transmission and surrounding hyperemia. One abscess was of increased echogenicity while the other was anechoic. CONCLUSION: Neonatal mastitis and breast abscess are unusual diseases that should be appropriately treated with antibiotics and drainage to avoid generalized sepsis, breast hypoplasia, and scarring. US is useful in distinguishing mastitis from breast abscess and guiding treatment options.",M2

19482578,"Nonlocal means-based speckle filtering for ultrasound images.In image processing, restoration is expected to improve the qualitative inspection of the image and the performance of quantitative image analysis techniques. In this paper, an adaptation of the nonlocal (NL)-means filter is proposed for speckle reduction in ultrasound (<e>US</e>) images. Originally developed for additive white Gaussian noise, we propose to use a Bayesian framework to derive a NL-means filter adapted to a relevant ultrasound noise model. Quantitative results on synthetic data show the performances of the proposed method compared to well-established and state-of-the-art methods. Results on real images demonstrate that the proposed method is able to preserve accurately edges and structural details of the image.",M2
19465292,"Central and peripheral corneal thickness measured with optical coherence tomography, Scheimpflug imaging, and ultrasound pachymetry in normal, keratoconus-suspect, and post-laser in situ keratomileusis eyes.PURPOSE: To compare central (CCT) and peripheral corneal thickness (PCT) using Scheimpflug imaging (Pentacam), high-speed optical coherence tomography (Visante OCT), and ultrasound (<e>US</e>) pachymetry (Sonogage Corneo-Gage Plus) in normal, keratoconus-suspect, and post-laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) eyes. SETTING: Department of Refractive Surgery, Cole Eye Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. METHODS: The CCT and PCT were retrospectively measured using US pachymetry, Scheimpflug imaging, and high-speed OCT from January 2006 to March 2008. The influence of age and absolute magnitude of corneal thickness were also analyzed. Analysis was by multivariate generalized estimating equations, multivariate linear regression, and linear regression plots. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-three eyes were analyzed. Ultrasound pachymetry CCT measurements were consistently higher than Scheimpflug and OCT measurements (mean difference 6.5 microm +/- 1.8 [SD] and 7.5 +/- 1.4 microm, respectively) (both P&lt;.0005) in normal eyes; the difference was statistically similar and not greater with keratoconus suspicion, age, or absolute magnitude of corneal thickness (P&gt;.05). Scheimpflug measurements were significantly lower than US pachymetry in post-LASIK eyes (P&lt;.0005). There was no statistically significant difference (mean 0.9 +/- 1.4 microm) in Scheimpflug and OCT CCT measurements (P&gt;.5), although Scheimpflug measurements were significantly lower in post-LASIK eyes (P&lt;.0005). Scheimpflug PCT measurements were higher than OCT measurements, showing more agreement with increasing age (P = .017). CONCLUSIONS: Scheimpflug and OCT CCT measurements were reproducible but always thinner than US pachymetry in normal and keratoconus-suspect eyes. In post-LASIK eyes, OCT pachymetry maps were more accurate than Scheimpflug maps. The influence of age on PCT requires further study.",M2
19458946,"Vallecular cyst as a cause of congenital stridor: report of five patients.BACKGROUND: Vallecular cysts are an unusual cause of congenital stridor. OBJECTIVE: To describe the imaging findings in five patients, with emphasis on the usefulness of sonographic studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1990 and 2007, five patients with a cystic lesion situated in the anterior neck, at the vallecular space, were seen in our institution. Clinical records and imaging findings were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: All patients presented with persistent inspiratory stridor that was present from the first week of life. Neck <e>US</e> was performed as part of the investigations in four and showed a vallecular cyst. The diagnosis was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy in four infants and CT in one; all were resected. Pathology showed a multilayered epithelial border with normal thickness and differentiation; there were no signs of malignancy. CONCLUSION: Although vallecular cysts are very rare, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of congenital stridor. When the commonest causes have been ruled out, neck US may be diagnostic. The diagnosis can be confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy or further imaging such as CT or MRI.",M2
19447214,"Ultrasonographic evidence of inflammation is frequent in hands of patients with erosive osteoarthritis.OBJECTIVE: Erosive osteoarthritis (OA) (EOA) is considered an aggressive form of primary OA that is defined radiographically by intra-articular erosions of the inter-phalangeal joints of the hand and characteristic deformities. The aim of the present study was the sonographic investigation of hand small joints in patients with EOA and comparison of the imaging findings with conventional radiography (CR). METHOD: Twenty-two patients (20 women, mean age 62.5 years) with clinical and radiographic diagnosis of EOA formed our study group. A total of 660 joints were assessed by both radiographs and ultrasound (<e>US</e>). US and plain films were evaluated by two different physicians on a blinded fashion. Erosions, osteophytes and deformities were evaluated by both US and plain films. Synovial thickening, effusion, and power Doppler signal indicative of abnormal vascularity were recorded in each joint during US scanning. RESULTS: Erosions were detected in 231/660 (35%) small joints by US and in 115/660 (17.4%) small joints by conventional radiographs (P&lt;0.05). Osteophytes were detected in 360/660 (54.5%) small joints by US, and in 310/660 (47.0%) small joints by conventional radiographs (P&lt;0.05). Thickened synovium was detected in 19 of 22 patients and increased intra-articular power Doppler signal, indicative of active inflammation, was detected in 18 of 22 patients. Thickened synovium was found in 159/660 (24.1%), effusion in 119/660 (18%) and increased power Doppler in 148/660 (22.4%) small joints. Intra-observer kappa value for agreement regarding US was 0.81 and plain films 0.86. In 31 instances extensive finger tenosynovitis was also evident. CONCLUSION: In patients with EOA, US is a reliable and a more sensitive imaging modality than CR in detecting erosions and osteophytes. US detects inflammatory changes in small hand joints in the vast majority of patients with EOA and suggests that current treatment modalities are inadequate treatment for this disease.",M2
19500104,"Use of ultrasound-guided percutaneous vacuum-assisted breast biopsy for selected difficult indications.To assess ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (<e>US</e>-VAB) for selected problem cases and to report experiences with two different biopsy systems. Fifty-one lesions have been biopsied using the Mammotome (n = 24) or the Vacora (n = 27) system. Main indications: lesion in scarring (n = 5), complex cystic &gt;or=8 mm (n = 7), increase in size (n = 10), architectural distortion (n = 4), uncharacteristic palpable abnormality (2), small size (n = 22), regional microcalcifications (n = 1). Results are verified by surgical excision (n = 10) or follow-up (n = 40). One patient was lost to follow-up. In four of the cases preceding core biopsy was inconclusive. four invasive carcinomas, two ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), three papillomas, six fibroadenomas, one adenosis tumor, one hamartoma, 10 complex cysts, 16 benign changes, three fat necroses, two granulomas, three unspecific inflammatory changes are verified. Surgery confirmed five malignancies, four benign changes, and converted one uncertain diagnosis (architectural distortion) from  inflammatory  to DCIS. Documented removal of all or most of the lesions correctly increased the level of confidence and open surgery could be avoided in 41/51 lesions. The two systems show different advantages and drawbacks. US-VAB may improve the level of confidence in selected difficult cases. Careful case selection and systematic retrospective correlation of imaging and histology remain crucial.",M2
19495542,"Levator defects can be detected by 2D translabial ultrasound.INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Childbirth-related morphological abnormalities or defects of the puborectalis muscle ( avulsion ) can be diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, but neither method is universally available. In this study, we tested validity and reproducibility of a new method for diagnosing levator avulsion by 2D translabial ultrasound. METHODS: Seventy-five women were examined for major morphological abnormalities of the puborectalis muscle by palpation, 2D and 3D ultrasound (<e>US</e>). For 2D US, we used an oblique parasagittal translabial approach. The operator using 2D US was blinded against all other findings. RESULTS: Agreement between observers for diagnosis of avulsion by 2D US was 87% (Cohen's kappa 0.56, CI 0.33-0.80). Agreement between tomographic 3D US and 2D US was 87% (kappa 0.61, CI 0.45-0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Defects of the puborectalis muscle can be diagnosed with 2D US. The finding of a discontinuity between the hyperechogenic muscle and the pelvic sidewall is moderately reproducible and agrees moderately well with palpation and 3D US.",M2
