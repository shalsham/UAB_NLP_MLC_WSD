20217874,"Genomic profiling of gastric carcinoma in situ and adenomas by array-based comparative genomic hybridization.Although genomic copy number aberrations (CNAs) of gastric carcinoma at the advanced stage have already been extensively characterized by array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) analysis, those of gastric carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) are still poorly understood. Furthermore, no reports have demonstrated correlations between CNAs and histopathological features of gastric adenoma. In this study, we investigated CNAs of 20 gastric CISs (Vienna category 4.2) and 20 adenomas including seven low-grade adenomas (LGA; Vienna category 3) and 13 high-grade adenomas (HGA; Vienna category 4.1), using oligonucleotide-based array CGH. The most frequent aberrations in CIS were gains at 8q (85%) and 20q (50%), and losses at 5q (50%) and 17p (50%), suggesting that these CNAs are involved in the development of CIS. We found that the pattern of CNAs in HGA was quite different from that in LGA. The most frequent CNAs in HGA were gains at 8q (62%) and 7pq (54%), whereas those in LGA were gain at 7q21.3-q22.1 (57%) and loss at 5q (43%). Interestingly, gains at 8q and 7pq, both of which occurred most frequently in HGA, were not detected in any cases of LGA. Of note, 8q gain was detected most frequently in both HGA and CIS but was undetected in LGA. Since HGA is believed to have a higher risk of progression to invasive carcinoma than LGA, these data suggest that 8q gain is important for the malignant transformation of gastric adenoma.

20172431,"Early diagnosis of lung cancer.Early detection and surgical resection is essential for the treatment of lung cancer. Although the introduction of low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) is considered to be one of the most promising clinical research developments, CT screening is used for detecting small peripheral lesions. Tumors arising in the central airways require other techniques for early detection. Centrally arising squamous cell carcinoma of the airway, especially in heavy smokers, is thought to develop through multiple stages from squamous metaplasia to dysplasia, followed by carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), progressing to invasive cancer. It would be ideal to be able to detect and treat preinvasive bronchial lesions defined as dysplasia and CIS before progressing to invasive cancer. Great efforts have been made to develop new mucosal imaging techniques. Bronchoscopic imaging techniques capable of detecting preinvasive lesions and currently available in clinical practice include autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB), high magnification ronchovideoscope, and narrow band imaging (NBI). For a more precise evaluation of newly detected preinvasive lesions, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used.",M1
20164538,"Taurine - a possible fingerprint biomarker in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer: A pilot study by 1H NMR spectroscopy.Urinary bladder cancer is a major epidemiological problem that continues to grow each year. It opens avenues for investigative research for the identification of new disease markers and diagnostic techniques. In this pilot study, utility of non-invasive (1)H NMR spectroscopy has been evaluated for probing the metabolic perturbations occurring in non-muscle invasive urinary bladder cancer. (1)H NMR spectra of urine of bladder cancer patients and controls (healthy and urinary tract infection/bladder stone) (n = 103) were acquired at 400MHz. The non-overlapping resonances of citrate, dimethylamine, phenylalanine, taurine and hippurate were first identified and then quantitated by (1)H NMR spectra, with respect to an external reference sodium-3-trimethylsilylpropionate (TSP). The concentrations of these metabolites were then statistically analyzed. The cancer patients showed significant (p &lt; 0.05) variations in concentration of hippurate and citrate as compared with healthy controls and benign controls. The significant elevation in concentration of taurine was observed in urine of bladder cancer patients, which was below the sensitivity limit of 400MHz in control cases. However, stages Ta, T1 and carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) cannot be differentiated on the basis of altered metabolite indices but their composition may reflect the biochemical alterations in metabolism of cancer cells.",M1
20120722,"[EORTC risk tables--a new diagnostic tool in urology]75-85% newly diagnosed bladder cancers are lesions that are not invading the muscle layer of bladder. Patients treated for bladder cancer in this stage are characterized that part of them will develop recurrent bladder cancer and it may progress. Depending on a patient's characteristics, after transurethral resection (TUR), the probability of recurrence at one year ranges from about 15% to 70% and the probability of progression at five years ranges from about 7% to 40%. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is a heterogeneous group of tumors with completely different oncological outcome. Taking into consideration the risk of recurrence and progression, many researchers attempted to define risk factors for bladder cancer. After many test and researches had been conducted in different research and development centres a few risk factors were detected such as: number of tumors, tumor size, recurrence rate, staging (7T), grading (G), presence of carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). Basing on those factors patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer were divided into three risk groups. Low risk group - single, diameter &lt; 3 cm, TaG1 tumors, high risk group - multiple, diameter &gt; 3 cm, frequently recurrent, T1G3 tumors with concomitant CIS, intermediate risk group - the rest of tumors not mentioned in prior two groups. When using this division into three risk groups there is no possible to predict the probability of bladder cancer recurrence and progression separately Although prognostic factors may indicate a high risk for recurrence, the risk for progression may still be low and other tumors may have a high risk of both recurrence and progression. In order to separately predict the short-term and long-term risks of both recurrence and progression in individual patients, the EORTC developed a scoring system and risk tables (EORTC nomograms).",M1
20116818,"Prognostic relevance of ductal margins in operative resection of bile duct cancer.BACKGROUND: The clinical relevance of the ductal margins in operative resection of bile duct carcinoma has not been well established. The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of ductal margins in patients with bile duct carcinoma. METHOD: A total of 256 patients with bile duct carcinoma were analyzed retrospectively. We compared clinicopathologic features, outcomes, and recurrences among patients who underwent curative resections with free margins (D-FRE: n = 185), noncurative resections only resulting from the involvement of ductal margins with carcinoma in situ (D-<e>CIS</e>: n = 13), noncurative resections only caused by the involvement of ductal margins with invasive foci of carcinoma (D-INV: n = 17), and noncurative resections resulting from any other margin state and/or distant metastases (OTH: n = 41). RESULTS: Histologic grades, node involvements, T classifications, and JSBS staging were significantly associated with the ductal margin state. The 5-year survival rate by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 54.7%, 52.4%, 17.6%, and 16.7% for patients with D-FRE, D-CIS, D-INV, and OTH, respectively. A multivariate analysis by the Cox proportional hazards model has shown that, in addition to lymph node involvement (P = 6.6 x 10(-4)) and venous invasion (P = 2 x 10(-5)), D-FRE versus D-INV and D-FRE versus OTH, but not D-FRE versus D-CIS, were independently associated with survival with P values of 8 x 10(-4) and 1.4 x 10(-5), respectively. Taken together along with the difference in the recurrence rates, patients with D-CIS seem to have outcomes similar to D-FRE but different from D-INV or OTH. CONCLUSION: Compared with free ductal margins, the ductal margins with invasive foci of carcinoma may involve a significant disadvantage in terms of patients' outcomes in surgical resection for bile duct carcinoma, unlike those with carcinoma in situ.",M1
20051162,"[Guideline on urothelial carcinoma of the bladder]Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is diagnosed predominantly in people over 60 years of age. The most common symptom is haematuria. Smoking is an important risk factor (relative risk 2.5 to 3). Cystoscopy is performed whenever bladder carcinoma is suspected. The recurrence rate of a non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma is high (31-78% within 5 years). A single intravesical instillation with a chemotherapeutic agent within 24 hours of transurethral resection (TUR) reduces the risk of recurrence. Carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) should be treated as high-grade urothelial carcinoma. Standard treatment for patients with non-metastasized muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma is cystectomy in combination with extensive lymph node dissection. There are several possibilities for urinary diversion following cystectomy, none of which are any better than the others. Bladder-sparing brachytherapy may be used in patients with solitary T1 - T2 urothelial carcinoma &lt; 5 cm. Neoadjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapy prior to cystectomy in muscle-invasive carcinoma only slightly improves survival. Cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy is the standard treatment for metastasized urothelial carcinoma.",M1
19969558,"Differential developmental expression of transcription factors GATA-4 and GATA-6, their cofactor FOG-2 and downstream target genes in testicular carcinoma in situ and germ cell tumors.OBJECTIVE: Testicular germ cell cancer is the most common malignancy among young males. The pre-invasive precursor, carcinoma in situ testis (<e>CIS</e>), presumably originates from arrested and transformed fetal gonocytes. Given that GATA transcription factors have essential roles in embryonic and testicular development, we explored the expression of GATA-4, GATA-6, cofactor friend of GATA (FOG)-2, and downstream target genes during human testis development and addressed the question whether changes in this pathway may contribute to germ cell neoplasms. METHODS: Fetal testis, testicular CIS, and overt tumor samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for GATA-4, GATA-6, FOG-2, steroidogenic factor 1 (NR5A1/SF1), anti-Müllerian hormone/Müllerian-inhibiting substance (AMH), and inhibin-alpha (INHalpha). RESULTS: GATA-4 was not expressed in normal germ cells, except for a subset of gonocytes at the 15th gestational week. The CIS cells expressed GATA-4 and GATA-6 heterogeneously, whereas most of the CIS cells expressed GATA-4 cofactor FOG-2. GATA target gene SF-1 was expressed heterogeneously in CIS cells, whereas INHalpha and AMH were mostly negative. Seminomas and yolk sac tumors were positive for GATA-4 and GATA-6, but mostly negative for FOG-2 and the GATA target genes. In contrast, pluripotent embryonal carcinomas and choriocarcinomas were GATA-4 and GATA-6 negative. CONCLUSIONS: Differential expression of the GATA-4 target genes suggested cell-specific functions of GATA-4 in the germ and somatic cells. The GATA-4 expression in early fetal gonocytes, CIS, and seminoma cells but the absence in more mature germ cells is consistent with the early fetal origin of CIS cells and suggests that GATA-4 is involved in early germ cell differentiation.",M1
19958071,"Diagnostic random bladder biopsies: reflections from a population-based cohort of 538 patients.OBJECTIVE: To assess whether diagnostic random bladder biopsies and the detection of concomitant carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) have an impact on the frequency of intravesical bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillations or radical cystectomy; and whether this affects the cancer-specific survival in patients with pTaG3 or pT1G1-G3 transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A population-based cohort of 538 patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer was prospectively registered in the Stockholm County during 1995 and 1996 and followed for more than 5 years. RESULTS: Random biopsies were recommended in all patients but the decision to take biopsies was made by the treating urologist and hence performed in 326 out of 538 patients (61%), which revealed concomitant CIS in 47 patients(14%). Sixty out of 103 (58%) patients with pTaG3 or pT1G1-G3 tumours, in whom random biopsies were performed, received intravesical BCG compared with five out of 22 patients (23%) where random biopsies were not taken (p = 0.004). Moreover, 23 out of 103 patients (22%) with pTaG3 or pT1G1-G3 tumours in whom random biopsies were performed underwent radical cystectomy compared with none out of 22 patients (0%) without random biopsies (p = 0.013). The Cox proportional hazard ratio for death due to bladder cancer in patients with pTaG3 or pT1G1-G3 tumours among patients not having versus having undergone random biopsies was 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.1-5.6). CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed in Stockholm in 1995 or 1996 with pTaG3 or pT1G1-G3 bladder tumours having undergone random bladder biopsies more frequently underwent BCG treatment and radical cystectomy and had higher cancer-specific survival than patients who did not undergo random biopsies.",M1
19910186,"Telomere lengths in the oral epithelia with and without carcinoma.Aging appears to be intrinsically related to carcinogenesis. Genomic instability due to telomere shortening plays an important role in carcinoma development. In order to clarify telomere dysfunction in carcinoma development, we examined the uninvolved epithelium adjacent to carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), i.e. background of CIS, and CIS itself, compared to control without carcinoma, using an improved quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) method. We also estimated anaphase bridge (AB), which is inferred to be related to chromosomal instability. In all cell types (basal, parabasal, and suprabasal), mean telomere lengths were significantly shorter in the background than in the control. We also demonstrated increased incidences of AB, not only in CIS, but also in the background and control epithelia with excessively shortened telomeres. Thus we have conclusively demonstrated that CIS arises from epithelium with short telomeres.",M1
19818448,"A review of bovine urothelial tumours and tumour-like lesions of the urinary bladder.Four hundred bovine urothelial tumours and tumour-like lesions were classified in accordance with the 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) morphological classification for human urothelial tumours. The spectrum of neoplastic lesions of the urinary bladder of cattle is becoming wider and bovine urothelial tumours share striking morphological features with their human counterparts. A classification system based on the WHO scheme would also be appropriate for the classification of bovine bladder tumours. Bovine urothelial tumours are most often multiple. Four distinct growth patterns of bovine urothelial tumours and tumour-like lesions are recognized: flat, exophytic or papillary, endophytic and invasive. Carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) is the most common flat urothelial lesion, accounting for approximately 4% of urothelial tumours. CIS is detected adjacent to papillary and invasive tumours in 80-90% of cases. Approximately 3% of papillary lesions are papillomas and approximately 5% are 'papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential' (PUNLMP). Low-grade carcinoma is the most common urothelial tumour of cattle. High-grade carcinomas, and low and high-grade invasive tumours, are less commonly seen. Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) infection and ingestion of bracken fern both play a central role in carcinogenesis of these lesions.",M1
19738453,"Definitive radiotherapy for carcinoma in situ of the true vocal cords.PURPOSE: To report long-term rates of tumor control after radiotherapy (RT) for carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) of the true vocal cords (TVC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with CIS of the TVC were treated curatively with megavoltage RT between July 1967 and December 2005. Most patients (28/37) were treated with cobalt-60; the remainder were treated with 2- to 6-MV photons. Small (usually 5 x 5) fields were used. Median RT dose was 60.0 Gy (range, 56.25-66.50 Gy; mean dose, 59.55 Gy) at 2.25 Gy per fraction. Approximately two-thirds of the patients (23/37) were referred for RT because of a recurrence after at least 1 stripping procedure. RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 9.5 years (range, 2-25 years), the 5-year rates of local control, local control with larynx preservation, and ultimate local control (including salvage surgery) were 91%, 91%, and 91%, respectively. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma developed in 4 patients (11%). Time to failure was 6 months, 12 months, 48 months, and 13 years. Two patients were surgically salvaged with a total laryngectomy, 1 with transoral laser excision, and 1 patient declined further treatment. Cause-specific survival at 5 years was 100%. No late complications were noted. CONCLUSIONS: RT to approximately 63 Gy at 2.25 Gy per fraction, using small (5 x 5 cm) fields produces excellent results in patients with CIS of the TVC.",M1
19694703,"Osteopontin expression correlates with invasiveness in cervical cancer.AIM: Osteopontin is a secreted, integrin-binding glycophosphoprotein that is overexpressed in many types of cancers and appears to be involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. To understand the role of osteopontin in carcinogenesis of cervical cancer, this study was designed to determine whether osteopontin is expressed in cervical cancer and carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) tissue as well as in normal cervical tissue. METHODS: The expression of osteopontin was immunohistochemically analysed from 68 normal cervix, 55 CIS and 52 invasive cervical cancer tissues using a paraffin-embedded tissue array. Immunostaining was evaluated by intensity and the percentage of stained cells. RESULTS: Osteopontin expression in normal, CIS and cervical cancer tissues was two of 68 (2.9%), 43 of 55 (78.2%) and 46 of 52 (88.4%), respectively (P &lt; 0.01). High intensity (strong positive)/high proportion (more than 50%) staining seen in CIS and cervical cancer tissue samples was 45 of 55 (81.8%)/22 of 55 (40.0%) and 50 of 52 (96.2%)/31 of 52 (59.7%), respectively (P = 0.029 and P = 0.054). There was no significant correlation between the immunostaining score and stage and the immunostaining score and survival. CONCLUSION: Osteopontin may have a potential use as a diagnostic factor for cervical cancer and osteopontin expression is closely correlated with carcinogenesis and invasion of cervical cancer.",M1
19687399,"Photodynamic therapy for head and neck dysplasia and cancer.OBJECTIVE: To determine the response of dysplasia, carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), and T1 carcinoma of the oral cavity and larynx to photodynamic therapy with porfimer sodium. DESIGN: Prospective trial. SETTING: A National Cancer Institute-designated cancer institute. PATIENTS: Patients with primary or recurrent moderate to severe oral or laryngeal dysplasia, CIS, or T1N0 carcinoma. INTERVENTION: Porfimer sodium, 2 mg/kg of body weight, was injected intravenously 48 hours before treatment. Light at 630 nm for photosensitizer activation was delivered from an argon laser or diode laser using lens or cylindrical diffuser fibers. The light dose was 50 J/cm(2) for dysplasia and CIS and 75 J/cm(2) for carcinoma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response was evaluated at 1 week and at 1 month and then at 3-month intervals thereafter. Response options were complete (CR), partial (PR), and no (NR) response. Posttreatment biopsies were performed in all patients with persistent and recurrent visible lesions. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled, and 26 were evaluable. Mean follow-up was 15 months (range, 7-52 months). Twenty-four patients had a CR, 1 had a PR, and 1 had NR. Three patients with oral dysplasia with an initial CR experienced recurrence in the treatment field. All the patients with NR, a PR, or recurrence after an initial CR underwent salvage treatment. Temporary morbidities included edema, pain, hoarseness, and skin phototoxicity. CONCLUSION: Photodynamic therapy with porfimer sodium is an effective treatment alternative, with no permanent sequelae, for oral and laryngeal dysplasia and early carcinoma. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00530088.",M1
19679056,"Natural history of esophageal and gastric cardia precursor by repetitive endoscope screening with 425 adults in a high-risk area in China.OBJECTIVE: To observe the natural history and to determine appropriate screening interval for esophageal and gastric cardia precursors. METHODS: Repetitive endoscopic screenings were performed among 425 forty to sixty-nine-year-old subjects in a high-risk region in Northern China. RESULTS: We observed 8 subjects develop severe dysplasia (SD), another 8 develop carcinomas in situ (<e>Cis</e>), and 4 develop invasive cancer. The time and baseline diagnosis (BD) for the 8 SD subjects were: 13 months after normal epithelium in one case, 7 months after base cell hyperplasia (BCH) in another case, 3, 4, 4, and 10.5 months after mild dysplasia (mD) in four cases, and 12.5 and 43.4 months after moderate dysplasia (MD) in two cases. The time and BD for the 8 Cis cases were: 18 and 51.7 months after BCH in two cases, 48 months after mD in one case, 4 and 13 months after MD in two cases, and 3.5, 9, and 17.5 months after SD in the other three cases. The time and BD for the four invasive cancer cases were, 13 months after mD in one case, 50 months after MD in another case, and 14 and 19 months after SD in two cases. In addition to natural history observation, we also found sex, age (over 50 vs under 50), family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer, and the presence of multiple esophageal lugol-void lesions to be significant predicators for dysplastic progression; the corresponding OR (95% CI) and P-value were 1.98 (1.14-3.46) and 0.02; 2.32 (1.29-4.19) and 0.004; 1.81 (1.06-3.11) and 0.03; and 4.67 (2.70-8.06) and 0.000 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A 5-year screening interval for BCH and mD, and a 3-year interval for MD, as suggested in China in 2005, may be too long for rapid developing precursors or individuals at high-risk for dysplastic progression. Therefore, shorter intervals should be considered.",M1
19637316,"Consistent genomic alterations in carcinoma in situ of the urinary bladder confirm the presence of two major pathways in bladder cancer development.Bladder cancer develops through different pathways, provisionally entitled  papillary  and  invasive.  Carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) is thought to be the precursor of invasive bladder cancer. However, little is known about chromosomal alterations of these clinically important lesions, and the relationship between chromosomal alterations and the different pathways. We laser-microdissected 12 CIS and 4 dysplasia samples concomitant to invasive bladder cancer. We determined genome-wide chromosome copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using Mapping 10K SNP microarrays. We further examined 48 high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers using SNP microarrays to reveal characteristic changes correlated with the CIS-phenotype. DNA copy-number changes were further validated using QPCR in 77 independent tumor samples. CIS was found to be chromosomal unstable in 8 of 12 cases. Characteristic chromosomal changes were copy number gains of chromosomes 5p, 6p22.3, 10p15.1 and losses/LOH of chromosome 5q and 13q13-q14. Tumor samples with these alterations were significantly associated with CIS. Using FGFR3 mutations as markers of the opposing papillary phenotype, we found 5p gains and FGFR3 mutations mutually exclusive. No FGFR3 mutations were found in 23 CIS and dysplasia samples. Based on this, we classified high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors according to FGFR3 mutations and chromosomal changes into papillary and CIS-type tumors with high correlation to CIS status (p = 0.001). Furthermore, we found significant correlation to the results of molecular classifiers based on gene-expression. We concluded that chromosomal changes may be used to characterize different pathways in bladder cancer development.",M1
19584157,"Identification of a new panel of serum autoantibodies associated with the presence of in situ carcinoma of the breast in younger women.PURPOSE: We examined the feasibility of using a panel of autoantibodies to multiple tumor-associated proteins as a method for early detection of breast cancer and, more particularly, carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: PPIA, PRDX2, and FKBP52 were identified as early-stage breast cancer autoantigens by proteomic approaches. The seroreactivity of a panel of antibodies consisting of these three antigens and two previously described autoantigens, HSP60 and MUC1, was tested on 235 samples (60 from primary breast cancer patients, 82 from CIS patients, and 93 from healthy controls) with the use of specific ELISAs. FKBP52, PPIA, and PRDX2 mRNA and protein expression levels were evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry in early-stage breast tumors. RESULTS: Three of five autoantibodies, FKBP52, PPIA, and PRDX2, showed significantly increased reactivity in primary breast cancer and CIS compared with healthy controls. When combined, the five markers significantly discriminated primary breast cancer [receiver operating characteristic area under the curve, 0.73; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.60-0.79] and CIS (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71-0.85) from healthy individuals. Importantly, the receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve value of the autoantibody panel was able to distinguish CIS, including high grades, from healthy controls in women under the age of 50 years (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92). Finally, only FKBP52 mRNA and protein levels were found to be increased in CIS and primary breast cancer compared with healthy breast tissue. CONCLUSIONS: This autoantibody assay against a panel of five antigens allows for an accurate discrimination between early-stage breast cancer, especially CIS, and healthy individuals. These results could be of interest in detecting early breast cancer as an aid to mammography, especially in women under the age of 50 years with aggressive cancers.",M1
19543904,"15-Year review of laryngeal and oral dysplasias and progression to invasive carcinoma.The objective of this study is to identify a management or follow-up strategy for patients with laryngeal and oral dysplasia. A chart review of all patients with laryngeal and oral dysplasia over a 15-year period was performed. All patients were followed for a minimum period of 5 years from initial diagnosis of oropharyngeal or laryngeal dysplasia. If invasive carcinoma was demonstrated on subsequent biopsies, the exact time of this was recorded and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted. In the laryngeal cohort, 45 patients were identified, 15 (33%) developed carcinoma, 7 of 30 patients (23%) with mild or moderate dysplasia, compared with 8 of 15 (53%) with severe dysplasia or <e>CIS</e> (P = 0.01). Thirteen of the carcinomas (87%) developed within 36 months of original biopsy. In the oral cohort, 32 patients were identified, 17 (53%) developed carcinoma, 1 of 9 patients (11%) with mild dysplasia, compared with 8 of 12 (67%) with severe dysplasia and 8 of 10 (80%) with CIS (P &lt; 0.001). Fifteen of the 17 patients (88%) developed carcinoma within 36 months of original biopsy. In conclusion, although numbers are small, our results show that mild and moderate laryngeal dysplasia behaves differently to severe dysplasia and CIS. Mild oral dysplasia also behaves differently to severe dysplasia or CIS. In general, progress to malignancy happens within a 3-year period. Severe dysplasia or CIS should be managed aggressively.",M1
19489068,"Human papillomavirus in early laryngeal carcinoma.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To examine the role of HPV status in the etiology, prognosis, and treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in early larynx malignancies. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective. METHODS: Thirty-eight cases of T1 or carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) laryngeal lesions were examined for the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) using an inclusive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/hybridization technique capable of identifying 37 HPV subtypes. RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 6 (16%) of the 38 lesions, representing HPV types 16, 26, 31, 39, and 52, and p16 tumor suppressor protein expression was confirmed in 10 representative cases. This HPV prevalence is higher than that noted in many previous laryngeal cancer studies, possibly due to the relatively large panel of subtypes screened for in this study. Identification of HPV-26, which has been associated with uterine cervical cancer, in an early laryngeal cancer specimen represents the first evidence of this subtype in a laryngeal carcinoma. Consistent with reports focusing on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) arising from other subsites within the upper aerodigestive tract, patients with HPV-positive laryngeal carcinomas were of younger age and were somewhat less likely to have a history of tobacco use, although the latter of the two findings did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the presence of a broad spectrum of HPV types in a relevant proportion of early laryngeal cancers, and together with evidence of an association of HPV tumor status with a more favorable clinical course, provide a rationale for the routine HPV testing of small larynx lesions.",M1
19441882,"Hexylaminolevulinate photodynamic diagnosis for multifocal recurrent nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential for hexylaminolevulinate (HAL) photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) to improve the management of multifocal recurrent nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a history of NMIBC and with at least two suspected papillary recurrences were enrolled in this prospective study between April 2005 and October 2006. The photosensitizer was hexylaminolevulinate (HAL) (PhotoCure, Norway), and the Storz D-light system was used to detect fluorescence. The bladder was mapped initially under white light and then using HAL-photodynamic diagnosis (PDD). The number and types of additional lesions detected by HAL-PDD over white light cystoscopy were measured. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (11 men), median age 74 years (range 35-84 yrs), underwent HAL-PDD. The median HAL instillation time was 109 minutes (range 60-250 min). Recurrent bladder cancer was confirmed histologically in 14/18 (78%) patients. Additional pathology was detected in 8/14 (57%) patients with confirmed recurrence and confirmed histologically in 6 of these. Additional pathology was papillary in 5/6 (83%) patients, and flat pathology was found in all six patients with additional foci. Carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) was detected in 4/6 (67%) patients with additional foci, three of whom were subsequently treated with intravesical bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). The sensitivity of HAL-PDD for the detection of tumor was 97.8%, compared with 69.6% for white light cystoscopy. The false-positive fluorescence-guided biopsy rate was 18/63 (29%). CONCLUSION: HAL-PDD allows more complete management of bladder tumor in patients with multifocal recurrence. The high frequency of additional lesions detected and the rate of detection of CIS suggest that HAL-PDD should be the standard of care.",M1
19373474,"Management of the contralateral testicle in patients with unilateral testicular cancer.Patients with a prior history of a germ cell tumor of the testicle are known to have an increased risk of development of a second germ cell tumor in the contralateral testicle. It is believed that all patients who develop a germ cell tumor of the testicle have a precursor lesion know as carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) or intratubular germ cell neoplasia. Approximately 50% of these patients will subsequently go on to develop a germ cell tumor in the testicle. A biopsy of the contralateral testicle in a patient with a previous history of a germ cell tumor of the testicle has been advocated by some, while others recommend a biopsy only in patients with other risk factors as well. The arguments for biopsy are that intervention may be used to prevent the development of a second germ cell tumor when CIS is detected. In this review we present the arguments for and against a biopsy of the contralateral testicle, review the techniques of biopsy as well as its complications, and discuss the interventions employed to prevent CIS from progressing.",M1
19291750,"Risk factors for recurrence of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia in the vaginal vault after laser vaporization.BACKGROUND: We sought to investigate risk factors for recurrence of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) in the vaginal vault after laser vaporization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 162 patients treated with laser vaporization in the vaginal vault after hysterectomy between March 1998 and August 2007, the clinical data of 68 patients were reviewed retrospectively. They underwent hysterectomy before laser vaporization due to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage Ia1-Ib1 cervical cancer (n = 17), cervical carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>, n = 18), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (CIN I, n = 4; CIN II, n = 9; CIN III, n = 12), leiomyoma (n = 5) and endometrial polyp (n = 3). All patients were diagnosed as VAIN I (n = 24), VAIN II (n = 18) and VAIN III (n = 26) in the vaginal vault before laser vaporization. Risk factors for recurrence of VAIN in the vaginal vault after laser vaporization were investigated by multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The median age was 48 years (range, 32-74 years), and the median duration of follow-up was 33 months (range, 10-115 months). Among all patients, 18 (26.5%) showed disease recurrence. Age (&lt; or =48 years) and VAIN III in the vaginal vault before laser vaporization were risk factors for recurrence after laser vaporization (age &lt; or =48 years, adjusted OR, 2.07, 95% CI, 1.18-7.01; VAIN III in the vaginal vault before laser vaporization, adjusted OR, 8.42, 95% CI, 1.63-18.56). CONCLUSION: Laser vaporization may be a feasible method for the treatment of VAIN in the vaginal vault after hysterectomy. However, age (&lt; or =48 years) and VAIN III in the vaginal vault before laser vaporization should be considered as risk factors for recurrence after laser vaporization.",M1
19253916,"Human testicular (non)seminomatous germ cell tumours: the clinical implications of recent pathobiological insights.Human germ cell tumours (GCTs) comprise several types of neoplasias with different pathogeneses and clinical behaviours. A classification into five subtypes has been proposed. Here, the so-called type II testicular GCTs (TGCTs), ie the seminomas and non-seminomas, will be reviewed with emphasis on pathogenesis and clinical implications. Various risk factors have been identified that define subpopulations of men who are amenable to early diagnosis. TGCTs are omnipotent, able to generate all differentiation lineages, both embryonic and extra-embryonic, as well as the germ cell lineage itself. The precursor lesion, composed of primordial germ cells/gonocytes, is referred to as carcinoma in situ of the testis (<e>CIS</e>) and gonadoblastoma of the dysgenetic gonad. These pre-malignant cells retain embryonic characteristics, which probably explains the unique responsiveness of the derived tumours to DNA-damaging agents. Development of CIS and gonadoblastoma is crucially dependent on the micro-environment created by Sertoli cells in the testis, and granulosa cells in the dysgenetic gonad. OCT3/4 has high sensitivity and specificity for CIS/gonadoblastoma, seminoma, and embryonal carcinoma, and is useful for the detection of CIS cells in semen, thus a promising tool for non-invasive screening. Overdiagnosis of CIS due to germ cell maturation delay can be avoided using immunohistochemical detection of stem cell factor (SCF). Immunohistochemistry is helpful in making the distinction between seminoma and embryonal carcinoma, especially SOX17 and SOX2. The different non-seminomatous histological elements can be recognized using various markers, such as AFP and hCG, while others need confirmation. The value of micro-satellite instability as well as BRAF mutations in predicting treatment resistance needs validation in prospective trials. The availability of representative cell lines, both for seminoma and for embryonal carcinoma, allows mechanistic studies into the initiation and progression of this disease.",M1
19250763,"Testosterone production is better preserved after 16 than 20 Gray irradiation treatment against testicular carcinoma in situ cells.PURPOSE: To study the effect of 16 Gy radiotherapy (RT) vs. 20 Gy RT on Leydig cell function in men treated with radiotherapy against carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) of the testis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-one men who were treated between 1985 and 2005 were included. Fourteen men had been treated with 20 Gy and 37 with 16 Gy RT. Measurements of sex hormone-binding globulin and basic and stimulated testosterone, as well as luteinizing hormone levels were performed. RESULTS: The follow-up periods for the patients treated without additional chemotherapy were for the 20 Gy and 16 Gy group mean/median/min-max: 9.0/10.0/1.0-20.3 years and 4.0/3.1/0.4-14.1 years, respectively. During the follow-up period, men treated with 16 Gy RT had stable testosterone levels (-1.1%/year, p = 0.4), whereas men treated with 20 Gy had an annual decrease of 2.4% (p = 0.008). For the latter group, the testosterone decrease was most pronounced in the first 5 years, leveling off during the following 5 years. Additionally, more men treated with 20 Gy needed androgen substitution treatment. Our study showed an increased luteinizing hormone level for the men treated with 16 Gy, although this was not significant (p = 0.5). We anticipated a similar increase in the patients treated with 20 Gy but instead observed a decrease (-3.1%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: RT at 16 and 20 Gy seem to affect Leydig cell function differently, with 16 Gy RT better preserving testosterone levels and thus being preferred from an endocrinological point of view.",M1
19239574,"Matrix metalloproteinase 7 and perlecan in oral epithelial dysplasia and carcinoma in situ: an aid for histopathologic recognition of their cell proliferation centers.BACKGROUND: As one of the valuable tools for differential diagnoses of oral epithelial dysplasia, carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we have proposed the immunohistochemistry for perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). As HSPGs have been shown to be extracellular docking molecules for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 7, our aim was to determine the expression mode of MMP-7 in these lesions for its possible diagnostic aid for oral borderline malignancies. METHODS: Twenty cases each of moderate dysplasia, CIS, SCC, and normal/hyperplastic/mild dysplastic epithelia of the tongue and buccal mucosa were immunohistochemically examined for MMP-1, -2 and -7 in reference to their perlecan immunolocalization. RESULTS: The expression of all three MMPs in the normal mucosal epithelium was restricted mainly to the parabasal layers. The most striking finding was strong expression of MMP-7 in epithelial dysplasia with a two-phase appearance: a clear demarcation of MMP-7-immunopositive (+) lower dysplastic/basaloid cells from non-positive upper keratinized cells. MMP-7+ cells were spread over the whole epithelial layer of CIS. In SCC, MMP-7 positivity was reduced from carcinoma cells but instead appeared in stromal cells. These expression profiles of MMP-7 resembled those of perlecan. MMP-1 and MMP-2 exhibited a similar but much weaker staining than MMP-7. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the enhanced metabolism of perlecan associated with MMP-7 plays an important role in the cell proliferation of oral epithelia in their malignant transformation process, and that MMP-7 immunohistochemistry may be a valuable aid for identification of the cell proliferation center in oral CIS and dysplasia.",M1
19234857,"Intravesical hyperthermia and mitomycin-C for carcinoma in situ of the urinary bladder: experience of the European Synergo working party.OBJECTIVES: To study the results of chemotherapy combined with intravesical hyperthermia in patients with mainly BCG-failing carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed CIS were included retrospectively. Outpatient thermochemotherapy treatment was done with mitomycin-C (MMC) and the Synergo system SB-TS 101 (temperature range between 41 and 44 degrees C), weekly for 6-8 weeks, followed by 4-6 sessions every 6-8 weeks. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were treated between 1997 and 2005 from 15 European centers. Thirty-four were pre-treated with BCG. Mean age was 69.9 years. Twenty-four patients had concomitant papillary tumors. The mean number of hyperthermia/MMC treatments per patient was 10.0. Of the 49 evaluable patients 45 had a biopsy and cytology proven complete response. In two patients CIS disappeared, but they had persistent papillary tumors. Follow-up of 45 complete responders showed 22 recurrences after a mean of 27 months (median 22): T2 (4), T1 (4), T1/CIS (1), CIS (5), Ta/CIS (2), Ta (5) and Tx (1). Side effects (bladder complaints) were generally mild and transient. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with primary or BCG-failing CIS, treatment with intravesical hyperthermia and MMC appears a safe and effective treatment. The initial complete response rate is 92%, which remains approximately 50% after 2 years.",M1
19214951,"[BCG versus photodynamic therapy (PDT) for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer-a multicentre clinical phase III study]PURPOSE: This multicentre phase III study was designed to compare the efficacy of Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) instillations and photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of patients with intermediate and high-risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria were multifocal pTaG1-G2 tumours, recurrent pTaG1-2 tumours, pTa / 1G3 tumours, and primary or recurrent carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). All patients were centrally randomised after transurethral resection (TUR) to receive BCG induction and maintenance therapy or a single PDT with Photofrin. The primary endpoint of the trial was recurrence-free survival. Secondary endpoints were the 2-year recurrence rate, the 2-year progression rate, survival, and quality of life. RESULTS: 124 patients (63 PDT group, 61 BCG group) were enrolled at 7 institutions in Germany and Austria. Each patient had a follow-up for 2 years. Of the 124 enrolled patients 105 were eligible for this analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated no statistically significant differences between the two therapy arms with respect to recurrence-free survival after randomisation (p = 0.4598). After intention-to-treat analysis and after as-treated analysis, the estimated median recurrence-free survival periods were 24.9 (BCG) versus 16.6 months (PDT) and 25.8 (BCG) versus 14.7 (PDT) months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A single PDT with Photofrin(R) in intermediate and high-risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer patients could not be shown to be superior to BCG maintenance therapy. Vice versa, the results of this study cannot exclude a superiority of BCG.",M1
19207616,"Testicular microlithiasis and carcinoma in situ overview and proposed clinical guideline.Testicular microlithiasis (TM) has been associated with testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) in adolescents and adults and with its precursor carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). A clear definition of TM and the need for further diagnostics and follow-up is lacking. We reviewed the literature of TM and its association with TGCT/CIS and current follow-up advises and propose a management approach based on associated risk factors for TGCT. In the literature, a wide variance of TM incidence is reported in different patient populations. A consensus concerning the malignant potential of TM has not been reached. In addition, a clear definition on TM is lacking. Although a correlation between TM and TGCT or CIS is found, precise management and follow-up schedules are absent. We suggest that all hyperechogenic foci smaller than 3 mm without shadowing should be named TM irrespective of their number. In addition, we suggest a management scheme for physicians encountering TM in daily practice. Our algorithm suggests taking a testicular biopsy in a selected patient population with at least one additional risk factor for TGCT. A long-term active follow-up schedule, including ultrasonography and physical examinations, is not indicated in the remaining patients with TM.",M1
19207607,"Risk of concomitant carcinoma in situ determining biopsy candidates among primary non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients: retrospective analysis of 173 Japanese cases.OBJECTIVES: To determine candidates for bladder biopsies among Japanese primary non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients according to the risk of concomitant carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). METHODS: Between January 1992 and August 2006, 173 primary non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer cases underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor with bladder biopsies for the detection of CIS. Correlations between biopsy results and preoperative/pathological features were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Positive cytology was statistically associated with the presence of concomitant CIS in multivariate analysis (P &lt; 0.01). Abnormal cystoscopic appearance outside the tumor almost achieved statistical significance in multivariate analysis among preoperative factors (P = 0.06). In our series, one (12.5%) of eight low-risk, 18 (24.7%) of 73 intermediate-risk and 41 (59.4%) of 69 high-risk cases had CIS in normal-looking sites, respectively. In cases with a single papillary tumor and negative cytology, one of 16 (6.3%) had concomitant CIS in their biopsy specimens at the normal-looking sites. CONCLUSIONS: All non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients with positive cytology are candidates for additional random biopsies. Targeted biopsies should be performed for all suspicious areas in the bladder mucosa. Random biopsies should be considered in cases with the macroscopic types of cancer for predicting intermediate- and high-risk cancer.",M1
19176205,"Carcinoma in situ of the urinary bladder: review of clinicopathologic characteristics with an emphasis on aspects related to molecular diagnostic techniques and prognosis.Carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) of the urinary bladder is defined as a flat lesion comprising of cytologically malignant cells which may involve either full or partial thickness of the urothelium. De novo CIS constitutes less than 3% of all urothelial neoplasms; however, CIS detected concurrently or secondarily during follow-up of urothelial carcinoma constitutes 45% and 90%, respectively, of bladder cancer. CIS is noted predominantly in male smokers in the sixth or seventh decade. Patients may present with dysuria, nocturia, and urinary frequency and urgency with microscopic hematuria. Cystoscopic findings may range from unremarkable to erythema or edema. Urine cytology is an important diagnostic tool. Cellular anaplasia, loss of polarity, discohesion, nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia, pleomorphism, and atypical mitoses are the histopathologic hallmarks of CIS. Extensive denudation of the urothelium, monomorphic appearance of the neoplastic cells, inflammatory atypia, radiation induced nuclear smudging, multinucleation, and pagetoid spread of CIS may cause diagnostic difficulties. Together with clinical and morphologic correlation, immunostaining with CK 20, p53 (full thickness), and CD44 (absence of staining) may help accurately diagnose CIS. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis of voided urine for amplification of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 and deletion of 9p has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing CIS in surveillance cases. Several other molecular markers, such as NMP 22 and BTA, are under evaluation or used variably in clinical pathology. Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillation is considered the preferred treatment, with radical cystectomy being offered to refractory cases. Chemotherapy, alpha-interferon, and photodynamic therapy are other modalities that can be considered in BCG-refractory cases. Multifocality, involvement of prostatic urethra, and response to BCG remain the most important prognostic factors, although newer molecular markers are being evaluated for this entity. Patient outcome varies based on whether it is de novo development or diagnosed secondary to prior or concomitant papillary bladder cancer. From a clinical perspective, the principal determinants of outcome are extent of disease, involvement of prostatic urethra, response to therapy, and time to recurrence.",M1
19143123,"New concept of schistosomiasis lesions of urinary bladder versus development of bladder cancer.Schistosomiasis haematobium precancerous lesions of urinary bladder included group 1: preneo-plastic non papillary (flat) lesions [reactive atypia, flat hyperplasia, keratinizing squamous metaplasia, glandular metaplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma in-situ (<e>CIS</e>)] and group 2 preneoplastic papillary lesions (typical papillary hyperplasia, atypical papillary hyperplasia, papilloma). The present work studied the content of the schistosomiasis precancerous lesions of the urinary bladder using image analyzer, thereby shedding more light on the significance on the early diagnosis of the high risky group. A total of 140 previously diagnosed schistosomiasis urinary bladder lesions (124 precancerous and 16 cancers as controls) were stained by H &amp; E, and Feulgen stain. The mean SPF was high in CIS (22.7), dysplasia (19.6) &amp; low in atypia (7.91). DNA ploidy, non-diploidy DNA was high in CIS (53%), papilloma, dysplasia and atypical papillary hyperplasia than flat hyperplasia, glandular metaplasia, keratinizing squamous metaplasia and typical papillary hyperplasia that were diploid indicating more tendency and aggressiveness of the first group to turn malignant than the second group.",M1
19107593,"Cyclin E deregulation is an early event in the development of breast cancer.Cyclin E has been shown to be overexpressed in some human breast cancers, however, data to support deregulation of cyclin E as an early event in human mammary tumor development is lacking. We analyzed surgical specimens from 183 patients with breast carcinomas and evaluated cyclin E expression in areas of invasive carcinoma, adjacent carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), and non-neoplastic breast parenchyma. Overexpression of cyclin E was seen in one-third of invasive carcinoma samples, one-third of the CIS component and nearly half of the non-neoplastic breast epithelial cells adjacent to carcinoma (44% vs. 33%, P &lt; or = 0.05). Nuclear labeling for cyclin E was highly concordant between areas of in invasive carcinoma, CIS and non-neoplastic breast epithelial cells from the same patient (P &lt; 0.0001). Localization of cyclin E to the cytoplasm was seen in a small proportion of tumor samples. Our findings suggest that cyclin E deregulation is an early event in the progression from histologically benign mammary epithelial cells to invasive carcinoma and occurs through both overexpression and altered cellular localization.",M1
19096306,"Detection and localization of intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive carcinoma using fluorescence-reflectance bronchoscopy: an international, multicenter clinical trial.OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit of using a new fluorescence-reflectance imaging system, Onco-LIFE, for the detection and localization of intraepitheal neoplasia and early invasive squamous cell carcinoma. A secondary objective was to evaluate the potential use of quantitative image analysis with this device for objective classification of abnormal sites. DESIGN: This study was a prospective, multicenter, comparative, single arm trial. Subjects for this study were aged 45 to 75 years and either current or past smokers of more than 20 pack-years with airflow obstruction, forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity less than 75%, suspected to have lung cancer based on either sputum atypia, abnormal chest roentgenogram/chest computed tomography, or patients with previous curatively treated lung or head and neck cancer within 2 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The primary endpoint of the study was to determine the relative sensitivity of white light bronchoscopy (WLB) plus autofluorescence-reflectance bronchoscopy compared with WLB alone. Bronchoscopy with Onco-LIFE was carried out in two stages. The first stage was performed under white light and mucosal lesions were visually classified. Mucosal lesions were classified using the same scheme in the second stage when viewed with Onco-LIFE in the fluorescence-reflectance mode. All regions classified as suspicious for moderate dysplasia or worse were biopsied, plus at least one nonsuspicious region for control. Specimens were evaluated by the site pathologist and then sent to a reference pathologist, each blinded to the endoscopic findings. Positive lesions were defined as those with moderate/severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), or invasive carcinoma. A positive patient was defined as having at least one lesion of moderate/severe dysplasia, CIS, or invasive carcinoma. Onco-LIFE was also used to quantify the fluorescence-reflectance response (based on the proportion of reflected red light to green fluorescence) for each suspected lesion before biopsy. RESULTS: There were 115 men and 55 women with median age of 62 years. Seven hundred seventy-six biopsy specimens were included. Seventy-six were classified as positive (moderate dysplasia or worse) by pathology. The relative sensitivity on a per-lesion basis of WLB + FLB versus WLB was 1.50 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.89). The relative sensitivity on a per-patient basis was 1.33 (95% CI, 1.13-1.70). The relative sensitivity to detect intraepithelial neoplasia (moderate/severe dysplasia or CIS) was 4.29 (95% CI, 2.00-16.00) and 3.50 (95% CI, 1.63-12.00) on a per-lesion and per-patient basis, respectively. For a quantified fluorescence reflectance response value of more than or equal to 0.40, a sensitivity and specificity of 51% and 80%, respectively, could be achieved for detection of moderate/severe dsyplasia, CIS, and microinvasive cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Using autofluorescence-reflectance bronchoscopy as an adjunct to WLB with the Onco-LIFE system improves the detection and localization of intraepitheal neoplasia and invasive carcinoma compared with WLB alone. The use of quantitative image analysis to minimize interobserver variation in grading of abnormal sites should be explored further in future prospective clinical trial.",M1
19076151,"Hexylaminolaevulinate 'blue light' fluorescence cystoscopy in the investigation of clinically unconfirmed positive urine cytology.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) using hexylaminolaevulinate (Hexvix, PhotoCure, Oslo, Norway) in the investigation of patients with positive urine cytology who have no evidence of disease after standard initial investigations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients referred with positive urine cytology but no current histological evidence of cancer were investigated between April 2005 and January 2007 with PDD, using Hexvix and the D-light system (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) to detect fluorescence. The bladder was mapped initially under white light and then under 'blue-light'. Biopsies were taken from abnormal urothelium detected by white light, fluorescence, or both. All cytological specimens were reviewed by a reference cytopathologist unaware of the result of the PDD. RESULTS: Twenty-five PDD-assisted cystoscopies were carried out on 23 patients (20 men/3 women; median age 64 years, range 24-80 years). Of the 23 patients, 17 (74%) were previously untreated for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), whilst six were under surveillance for previous TCC. Nineteen of the 23 (83%) cytology specimens were confirmed as suspicious or positive by the reference pathologist. TCC of the bladder or preneoplastic lesions were diagnosed in six patients, i.e. six (26%) of those investigated and six of 19 (32%) with confirmed positive cytology. Four of the six were under surveillance for previous bladder tumour. Additional pathology was detected by fluorescence in five of the six patients, including two carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), one CIS + G3pT1 tumour, and two dysplasia. Diagnoses in PDD-negative cases included one upper tract TCC and four patients with stones. In addition, one patient had CIS diagnosed on both white light and PDD 6 months later. CONCLUSION: Additional pathology was detected by HAL fluorescence cystoscopy in 32% of patients with confirmed positive urinary cytology. PDD is a key step in the management of patients with positive urinary cytology and no evidence of disease on conventional tests.",M1
19046264,"Expression of cyclooxygenase-2 by equine ocular and adnexal squamous cell carcinomas.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is expressed by equine ocular and adnexal squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). METHODS: Forty-three samples of histologically confirmed cases of ocular SCC or carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) from 34 horses presented to the Animal Health Trust between 1992 and 2004 were subjected to a standard, two-layered, indirect immunohistochemical method using a rabbit polyclonal antihuman COX-2 antibody. Ten formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples taken from recognized predilection sites for SCC, from the grossly normal eyes of 10 horses euthanized for reasons unrelated to this study, were used as negative controls. Samples of equine fetal kidney were used as positive controls. Following immunolabeling, the number of normal and neoplastic epithelial cells exhibiting positive COX-2 expression was recorded along with staining intensity and distribution. RESULTS: Of 43 tumors, 34 were defined as first presentation tumors. When compared with control tissue, in which 0% (0/10) of samples expressed COX-2, significantly more of these samples with SCC (58.6%, 17/29: P = 0.002), CIS (60%, 3/5: P = 0.022) or either tumor type (58.8%, 20/34: P = 0.001) exhibited positive cytoplasmic and perinuclear immunohistochemical staining for COX-2. Of the samples exhibiting positive immunohistochemical staining, only 10% (2/20) showed staining in 2%-10% of neoplastic cells, while 90% (18/20) showed staining in 1% of neoplastic cells. About 70% (14/20) of those positively immunolabeled samples exhibited an intensity of staining greater than or equal to the staining exhibited by the equine fetal kidney positive control. CONCLUSION: Neoplastic tissue from both equine ocular SCC and CIS exhibit COX-2 expression at significantly higher levels than normal control ocular tissue. However, the percentage of cells expressing positive immunohistochemical staining is consistently low. On the basis of this study, it is unlikely that anti-COX-2 therapy would be of benefit in the treatment of equine ocular and adnexal SCC.",M1
19066905,"Outcomes of patients with clinical <e>CIS</e>-only disease treated with radical cystectomy.OBJECTIVES: To report the long-term oncological efficacy of radical cystectomy for patients with presumed clinical CIS only disease, to characterize the likelihood of clinical understaging, and to characterize the pattern of recurrence. METHODS: One thousand six hundred patients have undergone radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection with intent to cure from August 1971 to December 2005 at the University of Southern California; 27 patients from this cohort who satisfied both the inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified. Relevant clinical and pathological data at time of cystectomy and during follow-up were reported. Overall and recurrence-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: At time of cystectomy, 33% of patients were found to be clinically understaged. Median follow-up was 94 months. Estimated 5- and 10-year overall survival was 87 and 56%, respectively. Estimated 5- and 10-year recurrence-free survival was 100 and 83%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent long-term survival outcomes can be achieved with radical cystectomy. Radical cystectomy should be strongly considered for patients who have failed prior intravesical therapy. Long-term surveillance of the retained urethra and of the upper tract is essential, as recurrence can occur years following cystectomy. Patients who recur are at high risk of dying from disease.",M1
19047897,"Molecular evidence for progression of microglandular adenosis (MGA) to invasive carcinoma.Microglandular adenosis (MGA) is an uncommon, benign breast lesion that is characterized by a proliferation of small uniform, round glands lined by a single layer of epithelial cells around open lumina with haphazard infiltrative growth in fibrous and fatty breast tissue. Although MGA usually has an indolent course, there is morphologic evidence that MGA can be a precursor for the development of intraductal and invasive ductal carcinoma. To investigate the possibility of such a transition, we studied 17 cases of MGA or atypical MGA some of which had given rise to carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) and/or invasive ductal carcinoma using the reticulin stain, immunohistochemistry (S-100, p63, Ki-67, and p53), and a molecular approach involving microdissection and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization and MYC chromogenic in situ hybridization. MGA and carcinomas arising from MGA were typically negative for p63 and positive for S-100 and Ki-67 and occasionally positive for p53. High-resolution comparative genomic hybridization identified recurrent gains and losses in MGA (2q+, 5q-, 8q+, and 14q-) and atypical MGA (1q+, 5q-, 8q+, 14q-, and 15q-). Some examples of MGA and carcinomas arising from MGA harbored few gross chromosomal abnormalities whereas others had considerable genetic instability with widespread aberrations affecting numerous chromosomal arms. Such widespread genetic changes, together with recurrent loss of 5q and gain of 8q were reminiscent of those reported specifically for basal-like, estrogen receptor-negative, and BRCA1-associated breast tumors. Concordant genetic alterations were identified between MGA, atypical MGA, and higher risk lesions (CIS and invasive ductal carcinoma) and in some cases there was an accumulation of genetic alterations as cases  progressed  from MGA to atypical MGA, CIS, and invasive ductal carcinoma. The molecular data suggests that MGA, atypical MGA, and carcinoma arising in MGA in a single case were clonally related. This result implicates MGA as a nonobligate precursor for the development of intraductal and invasive ductal carcinoma.",M1
19033717,"Transoral laser microsurgery for carcinoma in situ of the glottic larynx. A retrospective follow-up study.BACKGROUND: To investigate long-term results of transoral CO2 laser microresection (TLM) in glottic carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). METHODS: A retrospective study of 34 patients with glottic CIS treated initially with TLM between 1986 and 2004. Median post-operative follow-up time was 62 months. RESULTS: Three- and 5-year local control rates were 97 and 93%, respectively. Four patients developed local recurrence (rTis, rTis, rT1, rT4) that could be salvaged by repeated TLM in all cases. Neither adjuvant radiotherapy nor open partial or total laryngectomy was performed. There was no tumour-related death in this series. CONCLUSION: TLM can be considered as an effective method in the treatment of glottic CIS not only for the primary therapy, but also in cases of local recurrence.",M1
19019843,"Cell discohesion and multifocality of carcinoma in situ of the bladder: new insight from the adhesion molecule profile (e-cadherin, Ep-CAM, and MUC1).Urothelial cell carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) of the bladder is a superficially diffusive and highly discohesive disease. The authors analyzed the expression of some adhesion molecules (e-cadherin and Ep-CAM) and MUC1 in 32 unifocal and multifocal bladder urothelial cell CIS in an attempt to clarify this discohesion. E-cadherin was strongly expressed, in more than 75% of the cases. The presence of methylation of the CDH1 e-cadherin promoter gene was also investigated, but methylation was found in only one case. Ep-CAM was present in all the cases with a heterogeneous staining pattern. Similarly, MUC1/episialin was variously present in 94% of the cases without a polarized staining pattern and was expressed more strongly in cases with multifocal disease. Because loss of MUC1 polarization leads to interference with cell-cell adhesion mechanisms mediated by cadherins, these findings help explain why bladder urothelial cell CIS often shows a discohesive morphology and multifocality despite a strongly expressed adhesion molecule profile. Finally, Ep-CAM expression might provide some support for future target therapy trials.",M1
19007364,"Reduced bladder cancer recurrence rate with cardioprotective aspirin after intravesical bacille Calmette-Guérin.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate of patients taking cardioprotective aspirin after intravesical bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) for high-grade noninvasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, as preventing the recurrence of superficial bladder cancer might decrease patient morbidity and mortality from this disease, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) have shown promise in preclinical prevention through inhibition of the prostaglandin pathway and other mechanisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 43 patients with carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) and/or high-grade papillary bladder cancer were treated with intravesical BCG. Patients were stratified according to whether they took cardioprotective aspirin after treatment, and Kaplan-Meier curves of RFS were compared by log-rank analysis. Multivariable analysis was used for potentially confounding factors, including maintenance BCG, the presence of CIS, and smoking status. RESULTS: Of patients taking cardioprotective aspirin, the 5-year RFS rate was 64.3%, compared with 26.9% for patients not taking aspirin, with a significantly higher RFS by univariable log rank analysis (P = 0.03). Even after adjusting for the other factors by multivariable analysis, aspirin seems to affect recurrence (hazard ratio 0.179, P = 0.001). Maintenance BCG (hazard ratio 0.233, P = 0.02) and smoking history (hazard ratio 3.199, P = 0.05) also significantly affected recurrence. CONCLUSION: There was a significantly higher RFS rate in patients taking cardioprotective aspirin after intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer. The results of this study support the further investigation of aspirin and other NSAIDs as preventive agents in patients being treated for superficial bladder cancer.",M1
18992153,"Expression of BLIMP1/PRMT5 and concurrent histone H2A/H4 arginine 3 dimethylation in fetal germ cells, <e>CIS</e>/IGCNU and germ cell tumors.BACKGROUND: Most testicular germ cell tumors arise from intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified (IGCNU, also referred to as carcinoma in situ), which is thought to originate from a transformed primordial germ cell (PGC)/gonocyte, the fetal germ cell. Analyses of the molecular profile of IGCNU and seminoma show similarities to the expression profile of fetal germ cells/gonocytes. In murine PGCs, expression and interaction of Blimp1 and Prmt5 results in arginine 3 dimethylation of histone H2A and H4. This imposes epigenetic modifications leading to transcriptional repression in mouse PGCs enabling them to escape the somatic differentiation program during migration, while expressing markers of pluripotency. RESULTS: In the present study, we show that BLIMP1 and PRMT5 were expressed and arginine dimethylation of histones H2A and H4 was detected in human male gonocytes at weeks 12-19 of gestation, indicating a role of this mechanism in human fetal germ cell development as well. Moreover, BLIMP1/PRMT5 and histone H2A and H4 arginine 3 dimethylation was present in IGCNU and most seminomas, while downregulated in embryonal carcinoma (EC) and other nonseminomatous tumors. CONCLUSION: These data reveal similarities in marker expression and histone modification between murine and human PGCs. Moreover, we speculate that the histone H2A and H4 arginine 3 dimethylation might be the mechanism by which IGCNU and seminoma maintain the undifferentiated state while loss of these histone modifications leads to somatic differentiation observed in nonseminomatous tumors.",M1
18980278,"Total burden and incidence of in situ and invasive cervical carcinoma in Michigan, 1985-2003.BACKGROUND: With the recent licensure of a vaccine that protects against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18, US women are expected to experience lower rates of cervical cancer. However, surveillance systems must be in place in the US to measure the real-world effectiveness of vaccination programs. Although population-based registries will provide invasive cervical cancer (ICC) incidence and burden data, the impact of HPV vaccine on cervical cancer will not be measurable for several decades. Cervical carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), a cervical precancer and the immediate precursor to ICC, is an earlier presentation of HPV-related cervical disease that affects a much larger number of women, and monitoring trends in CIS could provide an earlier measure of HPV vaccine effectiveness. Currently, registries do not collect data on CIS except for the state cancer registry in Michigan, which has been continually collecting CIS data since 1985. METHODS: All cases of CIS and ICC diagnosed from 1985 through 2003 in the Michigan registry were identified. Available data include age at diagnosis, race, morphologic tumor type, and tumor behavior. RESULTS: There were 58,144 cases of CIS and ICC, of which 48,272 (83.0%) were CIS and 9872 (17.0%) were ICC. There were 2928 CIS cases and 413 ICC cases diagnosed in Michigan during 2003, compared with 1577 CIS and 516 ICC cases reported in 1985. Age-adjusted CIS rates increased from 1985 (31.7 per 100,000) to 2003 (59.2 per 100,000); rates of CIS were highest among women age &lt;40 years. Age-adjusted rates of ICC have declined since 1990, when the rate was 14 per 100,000 females; the rate is currently down to 7.8 per 100,000 females in 2003. CONCLUSIONS: The rising rates of CIS in women age &lt;40 years, coupled with declining rates of ICC, suggests the important role of early CIS detection in the prevention of ICC. The CIS trend data, used in conjunction with ICC trend data, help to provide a more thorough picture of cervical disease in the state and also provide baseline data regarding CIS burden in a prevaccine era. The experiences of the Michigan registry can inform the development of CIS surveillance in other registries, an important potential registry role relative to monitoring cervical cancer prevention efforts.",M1
18979398,"[Expression levels of the IAP antagonists XAF1, Smac/DIABLO and HtrA2 in testicular germ cell tumours]PURPOSE: Down-regulation of the IAP antagonistis XAF1, Smac/DIABLO and HtrA2, has been related to the onset and progression of various malignancies. We examined the mRNA-expression of these pro-apoptotic parameters in testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) and normal testicular tissue and correlated their expression levels to clinicopathological tumour features. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Real-time RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA-expression of XAF1, Smac/DIABLO and HtrA2 in normal testicular tissue (n = 18), carcinoma in situ (n = 4), seminomas (n = 64), and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (n = 35). RESULTS: Compared to normal testicular tissue, the expression levels of XAF1 were increased in TGCT (p &lt; 0.001), whereas those of Smac/DIABLO and HtrA2 were decreased (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001). Smac/DIABLO expression levels showed a significant trend towards a gradual decrease from normal testicular tissue to <e>CIS</e> and seminomas and finally to NSGCT (p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, XAF1 and HtrA2 expression levels gradually increased with progression of clinical tumour stage in seminoma patients (p = 0.001 and p = 0.018), their expression levels being strongly intercorrelated (Spearman rho correlation coefficient: 0.674; p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a down-regulation of Smac/DIABLO and HtrA2 is implicated in the development and progression of TGCT, whereas overexpression of XAF1 in TGCT might contribute to their extraordinary sensitivity to chemotherapy. Regarding the additional correlation of XAF1 and HtrA2 expression with clinical tumour stage in seminoma patients, it appears reasonable to further evaluate these three IAP antagonists as molecular parameters for the prediction of treatment response and prognosis of TGCT patients.",M1
18975579,"[Case of tuberculous epididymitis caused by intravesical BCG therapy]Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy is commonly used against superficial urothelial carcinoma, especially carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). We report a case of tuberculous epididymitis that occurred during a course of intravesical BCG therapy. A 76-year-old man had received intravesical BCG therapy for multiple superficial bladder cancer and CIS in prostatic urethra after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-Bt). He recognized hard nodules in the left scrotum after 4 times intravesical BCG therapy. Skin fistula in scrotum occurred 5 months later. We performed left orchiectomy with scrotum skin resection. Histological diagnosis was tuberculous epididymitis. Postoperatively, he was administered chemotherapy consisting of isoniazid, refampin and ethambutol.",M1
18814979,"Pathological examination of cordectomy specimens: analysis of negative resection.OBJECTIVE: Occasionally, after performing a cordectomy to treat a T1 glottic tumor, the pathologist does not detect carcinomatous cells in the surgical specimen. This study determined how often this happens and analyzed these cases to identify related variables. METHODS: Forty-six patients were studied. Data on patient age and gender, tumor T stage and macroscopic surface extension, device used (laser vs. microelectrode dissection (ME)), and presence/absence of a negative cordectomy were compiled. We performed excisional biopsies as a diagnostic procedure. RESULTS: Tumor stage was carcinoma in situ (<e>Cis</e>; 11 cases), T1a (28 cases), or T1b (7 cases). Nineteen tumors were limited, and 27 were extensive. Twenty-one patients underwent laser surgery, and 25 had ME. There were 12, 21, 4, and 9 types II to V cordectomies, respectively. The pathologist reported 15 negative cordectomies (32.6%). Only tumor extension was significantly associated with a negative cordectomy (p=0.047). CONCLUSION: In 32.6% of our cases, the excisional biopsy was diagnostic and therapeutic. This percentage rose to 52.6% in the cases of limited tumors. We recommend performing an excisional biopsy and limited resection of the surgical bed with ME or laser surgery. A pathologist can examine the margins to determine whether the resection should be extended. When choosing radiotherapy, it is better to first perform an incisional biopsy to obtain a diagnosis of carcinoma.",M1
18793301,"Positive urine cytology but negative white-light cystoscopy: an indication for fluorescence cystoscopy?OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible benefit of fluorescence cystoscopy (FC) in detecting cytologically 'confirmed' lesions when assessing urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, as negative white-light cystoscopy in cases of a positive cytological finding represents a diagnostic dilemma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2006, 348 patients, who had cystoscopy for surveillance or due to suspicion of urothelial carcinoma, presented with an entirely negative white-light cystoscopy at our hospital. However, 77 of the 348 patients (22.2%) were diagnosed with a positive cytological finding. All patients had white-light cystoscopy first and a bladder-wash cytological specimen was obtained, then FC, followed by cold-cup biopsies and/or transurethral resection of the bladder tumour. RESULTS: In the 77 patients with a positive cytological specimen FC enabled the detection of the precise site of malignancy within the bladder in 63 (82%). As malignant or premalignant lesions, there were 18 moderate dysplasias, 27 carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), and 18 pTa-1/G1-3 tumours. Moreover using FC, malignant or premalignant lesions were detected in 43 of 271 patients (15.9%) who had a negative cytological specimen (15 moderate dysplasias, six CIS, 22 pTa-1/G1-3). CONCLUSION: This study shows that FC is beneficial in the detection of malignant and premalignant lesions, if there is negative white-light cystoscopy but positive urine cytology. The immediate identification of the exact site of a malignant lesion during FC enables the physician to diagnose and treat these patients more accurately and with no delay.",M1
18712787,"Chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of high-risk HPV-infected women with HGSIL.Genomic instability is one of the main characteristics of malignant tumors, including HPV-induced cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the use of assessing chromosome aberrations (CA) in peripheral blood lymphocytes as a biomarker for genomic instability in high-risk HPV-infected women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL). A total of 120 women were recruited for this study, following cytology/colposcopy evaluation and HPV DNA detection. The study groups consisted of 30 HPV(+) women with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 and 30 HPV(+) women with carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). Two control groups, including 30 women HPV(-) and 30 women HPV(+), were recruited among women who were reported as cytology negative. Lymphocyte cell cultures were established for 52 hr, and 100 complete metaphase cells were evaluated per subject for CA analysis. The results show that women with CIS had significantly higher frequencies of both aneuploidy (0.67 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.14 +/- 0.08, P = 0.020) and tetraploidy (0.88 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.08, P = 0.013) in comparison with HPV(-) controls. These findings suggest the usefulness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to detect genomic instability associated with HPV-induced HGSIL.",M1
18661510,"Intracystic papillary carcinoma: a review of 917 cases.BACKGROUND: Intracystic papillary carcinoma (IPC) is an uncommon breast neoplasm. To the authors' knowledge there are limited data regarding its epidemiology and only small studies focusing on outcomes. By using a large, population-based database, this study aimed to identify specific characteristics of patients with IPC, investigate its natural history, and determine its long-term prognosis. METHODS: The California Cancer Registry (CCR), a population-based registry, was reviewed from the years 1988 through 2005. The data were analyzed with regard to patient sex, age at presentation, tumor stage, and overall survival. Cumulative relative actuarial survival was determined using a Berkson-Gage life table method. The CCR classifies IPC as either in situ (<e>CIS</e>) or invasive, as determined by the local pathologist. RESULTS: A total of 917 cases of IPC were identified. Approximately 47% of cases (n = 427) were CIS, whereas 53% of cases had invasion (n = 490). The majority of the invasive cases were localized at the time of diagnosis (89.6%; n = 439). At 10 years, patients with CIS and invasive disease had a similar relative cumulative survival (96.8% and 94.4%; P = .18). CONCLUSIONS: IPC is a rare disease. There is no apparently significant difference in the long-term survival of patients in the 2 histologically derived subgroups of IPC. There is an excellent prognosis for patients diagnosed with IPC regardless of whether the tumor is diagnosed as in situ or invasive. Clinicians should keep this in mind when planning surgical and adjuvant treatments. Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be a prudent way to evaluate axillary involvement in patients with IPC.",M1
18639470,"Phase II study of intravesical therapy with AD32 in patients with papillary urothelial carcinoma or carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) refractory to prior therapy with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (E3897): a trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of AD32, a doxorubicin analogue with little systemic exposure when administered intravesically, in patients with recurrent or refractory superficial urothelial carcinoma (formerly called transitional cell carcinoma [TCC]), or carcinoma in situ (CIS), who have failed prior BCG-based immunotherapy. METHODS: Eligible patients received six weekly doses (800 mg) of intravesical AD32 and were evaluated at 12-week intervals for 24 months or until date of worsening disease. Primary analysis was the proportion of all patients recurrence-free at 12 months. Treatment-related and GU-specific toxicities were also examined. All participating institutions submitted the protocol for Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. RESULTS: The study was halted due to unavailability of study drug after accrual of 48 of a planned 64 patients; 42 were included in the analysis. Of these, 28 (67%) were still alive after median follow-up of 61.1 months. Of 21 TCC patients, 18 (85.7%) experienced disease recurrence (median time to recurrence, 5.3 months). Of the 5 CIS patients with complete response (CR), 3 (60%) experienced disease recurrence; (median time to recurrence, 37.3 months). Recurrence-free rates at 12 and 24 months were 20% (90% CI, 7.8%, 36.1%) and 15% (90 CI, 4.9%, 30.2%), respectively, for patients with TCC and 80% (90% CI, 31.4%, 95.8%) at both intervals for CIS patients with CR. Infection was the most common treatment-related toxicity; no grade 4 or higher toxicity was observed. The most common GU-specific toxicity was increased frequency/urgency. CONCLUSIONS: AD32 is safe and active for treatment of recurrent or refractory superficial bladder carcinoma. The agent awaits more complete characterization when drug production problems can be solved.",M1
18579189,"Lymphovascular invasion and pathologic tumor stage are significant outcome predictors for patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma.OBJECTIVES: To determine the predictors of urothelial recurrence, distant metastases, and disease-specific survival (DSS) after radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). METHODS: The records of 136 patients who underwent RNU in our department between 1983 and 2004 were reviewed. The study population consisted of 116 patients from whom tumor specimens were available for re-evaluation, focusing on pathologic tumor (pT) stage, grade, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), concomitant carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), and the presence of significant tumor necrosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 38 months (range: 1-193 months). At actual follow-up, 63 patients (56%) were alive and disease-free. Concomitant CIS independently predicted urothelial recurrence (P = .008). Five-year actual DSS by pT stage was 100% for pTa and pTis, 95% for pT1, 70% for pT2, 54% for pT3, and 14% for pT4 tumors. Disease-specific mortality occurred in 32 patients (28%). A sessile tumor architecture, pT stage, grade, the presence of LVI (all P &lt; .001), a positive surgical margin (P = .012), tumor necrosis (P = .004), and lymph node metastases (P = .034) were significantly associated with reduced DSS on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed the presence of LVI (P &lt; .001) and pT stage (P = .023) as independent predictors for reduced DSS. CONCLUSIONS: RNU provides adequate local control and long-term DSS in patients with localized UTUC. LVI and pT stage are independent predictors for reduced DSS and can be used for the identification of patients who are likely to benefit from adjuvant therapies.",M1
18578657,"Prospective intermediate follow-up of carcinoma in situ involving the distal ureter at cystectomy: is there a role for ureteroscopy?BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The presence of urothelial carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) at the distal ureteral margin has been identified as a risk factor for upper tract recurrence after radical cystectomy. Management of this finding is controversial. The objective of this study was to determine if follow-up with ureteroscopy could aid in early detection of recurrences in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected prospective clinical-pathologic data for all patients who underwent radical cystectomy between 1999 and 2004. Patients with CIS at the distal ureteral margin were followed with endoscopy of the urinary diversion and bilateral ureteroscopy in addition to standard imaging and cytologic evaluation every 6 months. Recurrence was defined as detection of any malignant urothelial cells. RESULTS: In 250 consecutive cystectomies, eight patients were identified with CIS that involved a ureteral margin of 12 renal units. Ureteroscopy was successful in all cases, and there were no complications. Imaging was diagnostic in one patient, all cytologic examinations from the diversion were nondiagnostic, and ureteroscopy was positive in all recurrences. Six patients had recurrences at a median follow-up of 52.7 months; five needed laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, and one had disease controlled with percutaneous mitomycin C. Five patients were disease free at last follow-up, and one patient died with brain metastasis at 30 months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CIS that involves the ureteral margin are at increased risk for upper tract recurrence and progression. Aggressive follow-up with scheduled ureteroscopy may identify recurrences at an earlier stage. Development of additional markers for risk stratification and protocols for adjuvant treatment are needed.",M1
18575715,"Laminin-5 (gamma2 chain) is a marker of invading cancer cells in human gallbladder carcinoma: special emphasis on extension of carcinoma in situ along Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses.Gallbladder carcinoma (GC) is a relatively uncommon malignancy and is often caused by diagnostic difficulties in distinguishing the extension of carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) from invasive carcinoma along Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses (RAS). The laminin-5, a heterotrimer, is composed of alpha-3, beta-3 and gamma-2 chains. The gamma-2 chain is expressed in various invasive carcinoma cells. There are numerous reports that have described that laminin-5-gamma-2 is associated with tissue invasion in many organs. However, few studies are found in gallbladder carcinoma. To clarify the relationship between laminin-5-gamma-2 chain (LN-5) expression and the development of GCs, we performed an immunohistochemical study of 93 GCs. Cases were classified into three groups: CIS with/without the extension along RAS (Group A; n=17), carcinoma invading mucosa or muscular layer (Group B; n=5) and carcinoma invading beyond perimuscular connective tissue (Group C; n=71). The immunohistochemical intracytoplasmic expression was detected in the invasive fronts of the tumor. In the invasive components of Group B and C, LN-5 was expressed in 100 and 97% of cases, respectively, whereas in the CIS lesions of GCs, expression was not observed in Group A. LN-5 expression in the GCs tended to increase as tumors developed, which may be an indicator of the potential invasiveness of the tumor. Our results indicate that, in GCs, a strong intracytoplasmic expression of LN-5 was identified in the cancer cells whether in situ they extend along RAS or invading stroma.",M1
18566970,"Stem cell factor as a novel diagnostic marker for early malignant germ cells.Carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) of the testis is the pre-invasive stage of type II testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) of adolescents and adults. These tumours are the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Caucasian adolescents and young adults. In dysgenetic gonads, the precursor of type II GCTs can be either CIS or a lesion known as gonadoblastoma (GB). CIS/GB originates from a primordial germ cell (PGC)/gonocyte, ie an embryonic cell. CIS can be cured by local low-dose irradiation, with limited side effects on hormonal function. Therefore, strategies for early diagnosis of CIS are essential. Various markers are informative to diagnose CIS in adult testis by immunohistochemistry, including c-KIT, PLAP, AP-2gamma, NANOG, and POU5F1 (OCT3/4). OCT3/4 is the most informative and consistent in presence and expression level, resulting in intense nuclear staining. In the case of maturational delay of germ cells, frequently present in gonads of individuals at risk for type II (T)GCTs, use of these markers can result in overdiagnosis of malignant germ cells. This demonstrates the need for a more specific diagnostic marker to distinguish malignant germ cells from germ cells showing maturation delay. Here we report the novel finding that immunohistochemical detection of stem cell factor (SCF), the c-KIT ligand, is informative in this context. This was demonstrated in over 400 cases of normal (fetal, neonatal, infantile, and adult) and pathological gonads, as well as TGCT-derived cell lines, specifically in cases of CIS and GB. Both membrane-bound and soluble SCF were expressed, suggestive of an autocrine loop. SCF immunohistochemistry can be a valuable diagnostic tool, in addition to OCT3/4, to screen for precursor lesions of TGCTs, especially in patients with germ cell maturation delay.",M1
18535830,"Extramammary Paget's disease in Korea: its association with gastrointestinal neoplasms.BACKGROUND: Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) most commonly occurs in the perineal and genital areas of elderly people. The current treatment of choice is adequate surgical excision. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1990 and 2007, 28 patients (27 men and one woman) with EMPD were treated at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, by wide local excision (WLE) with a 2- to 3-cm normal skin margin.  Carcinoma in situ  (<e>CIS</e>) was defined as confinement of Paget cells to the epithelium, whereas  invasive carcinoma  was defined as infiltration of Paget cells into more than dermal connective tissue. RESULTS: Of the 28 lesions, 21 (75%) were located in the penoscrotal area. Six (21.4%) patients had associated gastrointestinal neoplasms, three with associated gastrointestinal malignancies and four with synchronous colorectal adenomas, including one with both. Surgical procedures included WLE with primary repair in 13 patients (46.4%), WLE with skin graft in 12 (42.9%), WLE with skin graft and Gracilis muscle transposition in two (7.1%), and combined abdominoperineal resection and distal gastrectomy in one (3.6%). Four patients (14.3%) also underwent inguinal lymph node dissection, with three found to have lymph node metastases. Of 11 patients with invasive carcinoma, three (27.3%) had lymph node metastases, compared with none of 17 patients with CIS. Patients with lymph node metastases showed a significantly lower disease-specific survival rate (P = 0.008). Patients with invasive carcinoma tended to have a lower disease-specific survival rate (P = 0.087). CONCLUSIONS: EMPD in Korea showed an absolute male predominance and an association with gastrointestinal neoplasms. Lymph node metastasis significantly affected, and depth of invasion tended to affect, disease-specific survival rate.",M1
18465346,"Breast cancer in situ. From pre-malignant lesion of uncertain significance to well-defined non-invasive malignant lesion. The Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group Register 1977-2007 revisited.In addition to nationwide standardized pathology forms for operable primary invasive breast cancer, the Danish Breast Cancer cooperative Group (DBCG) in 1982 introduced pathology forms for breast cancer in situ (<e>CIS</e>). The histological reporting form was used primarily for ductal cancer in situ (DCIS) treated with wide local excision. The form however, also provided information on lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), atypia and benign lesions. In 1989 the reporting form for DCIS was extended and now provided information on histological subtype, malignancy grade, growth pattern and both Estrogen receptor (ER) and Progesteron receptor (PR) status. Also mastectomy specimens were included. In 2004 the previous malignancy grading was replaced by the Van Nuys classification, and information on microcalcifications was introduced. The axillary status now included the sentinel node technique only. In 2006 the pleomorphic subtype of LCIS was added to histological subtypes. The present work reviews the DBCG guidelines and recommendations concerning CIS adding a brief characterization of the Danish CIS population. It also refers to the introduction of modern molecular pathology and distinction between low-risk and high-risk CIS lesions. A major point is that without the thirty years of outstanding efforts by the DBCG, future research would not be able to meet expectations.",M1
18440839,"The natural history of bladder carcinoma in situ after initial response to bacillus Calmette-Gúerin immunotherapy.OBJECTIVES: To explore patterns of recurrence, muscle invasion, and disease specific mortality in patients with bladder carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) who responded to an induction course with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Gúerin (BCG) immunotherapy. METHODS: Between June 1985 and December 2003, 104 patients (mean age 67 years) were diagnosed with either pure (38 patients) or concomitant (66 patients) CIS. Patients who responded to one (92 patients) or two (12 patients) induction courses of intravesical BCG instillation were included in the study. Response was determined and monitored by routine periodic bladder biopsies. Outcome of patients and the effect of various prognostic parameters were assessed after a median follow-up of 75 months. RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year recurrence-free survival rates were 63% and 54%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year muscle-invasive-free survival rates were 79% and 77%, and the 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were 90.5 and 85.8%, respectively. Median time to recurrence, muscle invasion, and disease-specific mortality was 18, 19, and 40 months, respectively. Pure and concomitant CIS were associated with a similar outcome. The recurrence of nonmuscle-invasive tumor did not increase the risk for muscle invasion or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Pure and concomitant bladder CIS share similar biologic behavior. Muscle-invasive disease is expected in about 25% of the BCG responders followed for long time periods and disease-specific mortality in 15%. Tumor recurrence, whether nonmuscle-invasive or muscle-invasive, follows a similar time table suggesting that these are not sequential but parallel and independent processes.",M1
18420341,"Origin of pluripotent germ cell tumours: the role of microenvironment during embryonic development.Carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) testis, known also as intratubular germ cell neoplasia, is the cancer stem cell from which the great majority of testicular germ cell derived tumours (TGCTs) of the testis arise. TGCTs can proliferate into morphologically homogeneous seminomas or can differentiate into virtually any type of tissue and form teratomas (non-seminomas). CIS cells display a close phenotypic similarity to fetal germ cells (primordial germ cells or gonocytes) suggesting an origin due to a developmental delay or arrest of differentiation of early germ cells. The pluripotency of these neoplasms has recently been explained by a close resemblance of their expression profile to that of embryonic inner cell mass cells studied in culture as embryonic stem cells, with high expression of transcription factors associated with pluripotency, such as NANOG and OCT3/4, as well as proteins found in several tissue specific stem cells, such as TFAP2C (AP-2gamma) or KIT. CIS and seminomas highly express a number of pre-meiotic germ cell specific genes, which are down-regulated during development to non-seminomas, while the expression of other embryonic markers, such as SOX2, is up-regulated. The mechanistic pathways and causative factors remain to be elucidated of both the initial transformation of fetal germ cells into CIS cells and the progression of CIS cells into an invasive tumour in the young adult. However, evidence supported by epidemiological studies indicate that disturbances in the hormonal microenvironment of the differentiating gonads may results in both the neoplasia and a host of other problems later in life, such as genital malformations, decreased spermatogenesis, and signs of hypogonadism.",M1
18382100,"Pancreatogram findings for carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) of the pancreas seen on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and postoperative pancreatography of resected specimens: can CIS be diagnosed preoperatively?BACKGROUND/AIMS: From 1992 to 2003, 7 carcinomata in situ (CIS) were incidentally discovered during microscopical observation of resected materials for advanced carcinomas of peripancreatic organs, of which 4 had undergone endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or postoperative pancreatography of the resected specimen (POP). In addition, 7 of 79 invasive ductal carcinomata (IDC) of the pancreas were accompanied by CIS &gt; or =2 cm long. A total of 11 patients were reviewed here for pancreatographic findings for CIS of the pancreas. METHODS: All resected pancreatobiliary materials were sliced serially at 5- to 8-mm intervals in a plane at right angles to the main pancreatic duct, referring to POP images. RESULTS: Irregularity (I), non-continuous narrowing (N), granular defects (G), and dilatation (D) were seen in 78, 67, 33 and 22% on ERCP, respectively, and in 90, 70, 60 and 40% on POP, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: I, N, G, and D are most important pancreatographic findings in ERCP and highly suggestive of CIS of the pancreas, so that whenever they are encountered, cytological and/or pathological examination of the pancreatic duct should be actively performed.",M1

METHODS: Between January 1995 and January 2001, 185 patients (male, 155; female, 30) diagnosed with bladder CIS underwent weekly BCG instillations (80 mg of Tokyo 172 strain) for eight weeks. Primary, concomitant, and secondary CIS was found in 62 (33.5%), 60 (32.4%) and 63 (34.1%), patients, respectively. Seventy-five (40.5%) and 64 (34.6%) patients had limited and extensive CIS, respectively. The median follow up period was 37.5 months (range 4-95 months). RESULTS: The overall complete response rate was 86.5%. The five-year progression-free survival rate was 78.5%. Several factors, such as age (&lt;60 or &gt;or=60 years), gender, previous transurethral resection, type of CIS, and CIS extension (three or more positive sites out of four to six biopsy sites was defined as extensive), were examined by multivariate analysis to predict progression. The extension of CIS was the only independent prognostic factor. The five-year recurrence-free rate of complete responders (n = 160) was 66.0%. Radical cystectomy was performed in 10 patients (6.3%) during follow up incomplete responders, of whom seven had invasive bladder cancer. Extravesical involvement was identified in 30 patients (16.2%) among whom, 21 (11.3%) had upper urinary tract recurrence and nine (4.9%) had prostatic involvement. CONCLUSION: Therapy with BCG is effective against CIS, the extent of which might be a prognostic factor. Disease progression including extravesical involvement should be carefully monitored over the long-term after BCG therapy.",M1
18348162,"FOXL2 and SOX9 as parameters of female and male gonadal differentiation in patients with various forms of disorders of sex development (DSD).The transcription factors SOX9 and FOXL2 are required for male and female mammalian gonadal development. We have used specific antibodies to investigate the role of these key proteins in disorders of sex development (DSD), specifically inter-sex states. In normal gonads, SOX9 was found to be restricted to the presence of (pre-)Sertoli cells, while FOXL2 was found in granulosa cells, and in stromal cells interpreted as early ovarian stroma. Both proteins were found within a single patient, when testicular and ovarian development was present; and within the same gonad, when both differentiation lineages were identified, as in ovotesticular DSD (ie hermaphrodite). Especially SOX9 was informative to support the presence of early testicular development (ie seminiferous tubules), expected based on morphological criteria only. In a limited number of DSD cases, FOXL2 was found within reasonably well-developed seminiferous tubules, but double staining demonstrated that it was never strongly co-expressed with SOX9 in the same cell. All seminiferous tubules containing carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), the malignant counterpart of a primordial germ cell, ie the precursor of type II germ cell tumours of the testis, seminomas and non-seminomas, showed the presence of SOX9 and not FOXL2. In contrast, gonadoblastomas (GBs), the precursor of the same type of cancer, in a dysgenetic gonad, showed expression of FOXL2 and no, or only very low, SOX9 expression. These findings indicate that gonadal differentiation, ie testicular or ovarian, determines the morphology of the precursor of type II germ cell tumours, CIS or GB, respectively. We show that in DSD patients, the formation of either ovarian or/and testicular development can be visualized using FOXL2 and SOX9 expression, respectively. In addition, it initiates a novel way to study the role of the supportive cells in the development of either CIS or GB.",M1
18348160,"Differential expression of SOX17 and SOX2 in germ cells and stem cells has biological and clinical implications.Combined action of SOX and POU families of transcription factors plays major roles in embryonic development. In embryonic stem cells, the combination of SOX2 and POU5F1 (OCT3/4) is essential for maintaining the undifferentiated state by activating pluripotency-linked genes, and inhibition of genes involved in differentiation. Besides embryonic stem cells, POU5F1 is also present in early germ cells, primordial germ cells, and gonocytes, where it has a role in suppression of apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that SOX2 is absent in germ cells of human fetal gonads, and as expected carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), ie the precursor lesion of testicular germ cell tumours of adolescents and adults (TGCTs), and seminoma. Based on genome-wide expression profiling, SOX17 was found to be present, instead of SOX2, in early germ cells and their malignant counterparts, CIS and seminoma. Immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis, and quantitative RT-PCR showed that SOX17 is a suitable marker to distinguish seminoma from embryonal carcinoma, confirmed in representative cell lines. Aberrant SOX2 expression can be present in Sertoli cells when associated with CIS, which can be misdiagnosed as embryonal carcinoma. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the absence of SOX2 in human embryonic and malignant germ cells, which express SOX17 in conjunction with POU5F1. This finding has both diagnostic and developmental biological implications. It allows the identification of seminoma-like cells from embryonal carcinoma based on a positive marker and might be the explanation for the different function of POU5F1 in normal and malignant germ cells versus embryonic stem cells.",M1
18289797,"Application of stem cell markers in search for neoplastic germ cells in dysgenetic gonads, extragonadal tumours, and in semen of infertile men.Germ cell tumours (GCTs) are a complex entity. Current areas of attention include early detection and avoidance of unnecessary over-treatment. Novel findings regarding diagnosis of GCTs located in various anatomical sites are described, particularly testicular GCTs and their common progenitor, carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). Recognition of CIS enables intervention before tumour development, but nevertheless, testicular GCTs are sporadically diagnosed at the pre-invasive stage where minimal treatment is necessary. As presence of CIS is asymptomatic, a simple screening method is needed when CIS is suspected (i.e. in males investigated for infertility). To develop approaches for early detection CIS gene expression studies have been performed showing many similarities with embryonic stem cells with confirmation of established markers (i.e. PLAP, OCT-3/4, KIT) and identification of novel markers (i.e. AP-2 gamma, NANOG). We have reported a very promising new approach of AP-2 gamma (or OCT3/4) based immunocytological semen analysis (specificity 93.6%, sensitivity 54.5%). Comparative studies of gonadal/extragonadal GCTs have revealed resemblance pointing towards similar, but not identical, origins. Moreover, infertility and testicular cancer are connected in the 'Testicular Dysgenesis Syndrome' and 25% of contralateral testes from testicular GCT patients harbour dysgenetic features, including impaired spermatogenesis. Thus, recent data have provided potential diagnostic tools including CIS detection in semen, microarray-based tumour classification, additional serological GCT markers, and novel stem cell markers for immunohistochemical diagnosis of gonadal and extragonadal GCTs. Many CIS candidate genes are yet uninvestigated, and information from these could increase knowledge about CIS tumour initiation/progression and be used for optimisation of a non-invasive detection method.",M1
18237400,"Bioinformatic identification of FGF, p38-MAPK, and calcium signalling pathways associated with carcinoma in situ in the urinary bladder.BACKGROUND: Carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) is believed to be a precursor of invasive bladder cancer. Identification of CIS is a valuable prognostic factor since radical treatment strategies can be offered these patients before the disease becomes invasive. METHODS: We developed a pathway based classifier approach to predict presence or absence of CIS in patients suffering from non muscle invasive bladder cancer. From Ingenuity Pathway Analysis we considered four canonical signalling pathways (p38 MAPK, FGF, Calcium, and cAMP pathways) with most coherent expression of transcription factors (TFs) across samples in a set of twenty-eight non muscle invasive bladder carcinomas. These pathways contained twelve TFs in total. We used the expression of the TFs to predict presence or absence of CIS in a Leave-One-Out Cross Validation classification. RESULTS: We showed that TF expression levels in three pathways (FGF, p38 MAPK, and calcium signalling) or the expression of the twelve TFs together could be used to predict presence or absence of concomitant CIS. A cluster analysis based on expression of the twelve TFs separated the samples in two main clusters: one branch contained 11 of the 15 patients without concomitant CIS and with the majority of the genes being down regulated; the other branch contained 10 of 13 patients with concomitant CIS, and here genes were mostly up regulated. The expression in the CIS group was comparable to the expression of twenty-three patients suffering from muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma. Finally, we validated our results in an independent test set and found that prediction of CIS status was possible using TF expression of the p38 MAPK pathway. CONCLUSION: We conclude that it is possible to use pathway analysis for molecular classification of bladder tumors.",M1
18217980,"Microarray analysis of normal cervix, carcinoma in situ, and invasive cervical cancer: identification of candidate genes in pathogenesis of invasion in cervical cancer.The objective of this study was to identify genes that are related to pathogenesis of carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) to invasive cervical cancer with the use of oligonucleotide microarray and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Each two cases of normal cervix, CIS, and invasive cervical cancer were investigated with DNA microarray technology. Differential gene expression profiles among them were analyzed. Expression levels of selected genes from the microarray results were confirmed by RT-PCR. The expressions of 15,286 genes were compared and 458 genes were upregulated or downregulated by twofold or more compared with each other group. Among 458 genes, 22 genes were upregulated and 40 genes were downregulated by twofold or more in invasive cervical cancer group compared with CIS group. RT-PCR analysis confirmed upregulation of 18 genes and downregulation of 5 genes in invasive cervical cancer group. RBP1, TFRC, SPP1, SAA1, ARHGAP8, and NDRG1, which were upregulated, and GATA3, PLAGL1, APOD, DUSP1, and CYR61, which were downregulated, were considered as candidate genes associated with invasion of cervical cancer.",M1
18214039,"Difference in cell proliferation between two structurally different lesions in colorectal adenomas: high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma in situ.BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that most Western pathologists diagnose carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) in many organs the same pathologists generally diagnose similar histological aberrations in colorectal adenomas, as high-grade dysplasia (HGD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five large colorectal adenomas (measuring &gt; or =20 mm) having areas of both HGD and CIS on staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) were assessed with the proliferation antibody Ki-67 (clone MIB1). RESULTS: HGD is built of tightly packed, spindle shaped, hyperchromatic cells with moderate pleomorphic nuclei having coarse chromatin and CIS of marked pleomorphic, vesicular, hypochromatic nuclei with a prominent nucleolus. Ki-67 was expressed in 96% of the HGD cells but only in 3.5% of the CIS cells (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this and of previous investigations using the DNA-specific Feulgen stain, suggest that HGD and CIS in colorectal adenomas are two dissimilar morphological entities with dissimilar molecular behaviour. HGD cells in colorectal adenomas seem to be proliferating at any given time, whereas the majority of the CIS cells are not.",M1
18203779,"Heterogeneous distribution of ITGCNU in an adult testis: consequences for biopsy-based diagnosis.Carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) of the testis, also referred to as intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified (ITGCNU), is currently accepted as the common precursor for all malignant germ cell tumors of adolescents and adults- that is, the seminomatous and nonseminoma cancers. These preinvasive cells have specific cellular characteristics, which can be used for the early diagnosis-routinely done by morphological analysis, sometimes supported by immunohistochemistry-of tissue obtained by an open surgical biopsy. False-negative biopsy results can occur mostly because of the nonrandom distribution of ITGCNU within the testis, misdiagnosis, or suboptimal tissue treatment and analysis. In this article, we demonstrate the potential pitfalls in the diagnosis of ITGCNU. The results support the use of the highly specific and sensitive immunohistochemical marker OCT3/4 for the diagnosis of ITGCNU and provide evidence for the nonrandom distribution of ITGCNU, which is a significant limitation in the diagnosis of this preinvasive lesion.",M1
18086769,"A longitudinal Swedish study on screening for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma: evidence of effectiveness and overtreatment.BACKGROUND: Organized Papanicolaou (Pap) screening has markedly reduced the incidence of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, the potential for overtreatment of precursor lesions is quite high for SCC, and the effectiveness of Pap screening for prevention of cervical adenocarcinoma is questionable. METHODS: Using the nationwide, virtually complete Swedish Cancer Register, we analyzed standardized incidence rates for SCC in situ (<e>CIS</e>), SCC, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and adenocarcinoma, between 1968 and 2002. For each county, we calculated Spearman correlations between incidence of in situ lesions and incidence of invasive cancer, 5, 10, and 15 years later. We also used generalized estimating equation (GEE) models to compare adjusted estimates for associations between in situ incidences and invasive carcinomas over counties. RESULTS: The overall decrease in SCC incidence in Sweden following the introduction of cervical screening confirms the beneficial nature of cervical screening on SCC incidence over the last 30 years. A similar benefit was not apparent for adenocarcinoma. GEE estimates for the relative change in SCC for an increase of 100 CIS cases per 100,000 women-years were 1.05 for the 5-year and 1.02 for the 10-year lag periods. For adenocarcinoma and AIS, similar analyses gave corresponding estimates of 1.17 for the 5-year and 1.08 for the 10-year lag periods. The lack of an inverse correlation suggests that increased reported incidence of CIS in certain counties did not forecast a reduction in SCC for those counties. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the effectiveness of Pap smear screening in reducing the incidence of SCC, but suggest no clear benefit on adenocarcinoma. Our data also suggest that relaxed histopathologic criteria for diagnosis of cervical CIS may increase its recorded incidence with no measurable benefit in the reduction of invasive cancer.",M1
18077314,"Activin receptor subunits in normal and dysfunctional adult human testis.BACKGROUND: The cellular sites of activin action and its regulation in the normal and dysfunctional adult human testis are unknown. METHODS: Activin type I (ALK2 and ALK4) and type II (ActRIIA and ActRIIB) receptors were detected using immunohistochemistry on Bouins fixed sections of normal, carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), seminoma, non-seminoma and gonadotropin-deprived human testis. ActRIIA mRNA was localized by in situ hybridization. RESULTS: ALK2, ALK4 and ActRIIB proteins were observed in Sertoli cells, spermatogonia and some spermatocytes within normal and gonadotropin-suppressed adult human testis; all three receptor subunits were also detected in CIS, seminoma and non-seminoma cells. ActRIIA immunoreactivity was faint to absent in the normal testis and in CIS and non-seminoma cells, whereas some seminoma cells displayed a strong signal. Also in contrast to the normal testis, a majority of spermatogonia and Sertoli cells in gonadotropin-deprived samples exhibited a strong ActRIIA immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization signal. CONCLUSIONS: Spermatogonia and Sertoli cells appear as the primary targets of activin action in the adult human testis. Changes in testicular function associated with altered hormone levels may enhance ActRIIA mRNA and protein synthesis, thus modifying signalling by activin or other TGFbeta ligands within specific cells of the seminiferous epithelium.",M1
17996602,"Characteristics of ductal carcinoma in situ in magnetic resonance imaging.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate typical dynamic and morphological characteristics of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An optimized diagnosis of DCIS is considered to be valuable for radiologists and clinicians, especially for early and successful treatment planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance examinations of 74 patients with pure DCIS were evaluated. Categories were established for signal increase (C1=the same enhancement as glandular tissue; C2=slow and continuous; C3=strong initial and slow further increase; C4=strong initial increase and plateau phenomenon; and C5=strong initial increase followed by a washout phenomenon) and morphological findings (M0=no pattern observed; M1=linear or linear-branched; M2=segmental dotted or granular; M3=segmental homogenous; and M4=focal spotlike). All cases were associated with histopathological results. RESULTS: Regarding the 74 DCIS lesions, 37 (50%) showed a signal increase typical of malignancy (C4 and C5). Among all cases, 33.3% of G1 lesions, 68.4% of G2 lesions, and 55.5% of G3 lesions presented a C4 or C5 enhancement. Furthermore, 55.4% (n=41) showed a segmental dotted enhancement (M2), whereas 17.6% showed a focal spotlike enhancement (M4). The morphological features of the other lesions were as follows: 12.2% homogeneous (M3) and 4.0% linear (M1). In 8 cases (10.8%), no significant pattern was observed (M0). Combining dynamic and morphological characteristics, 68.9% presented an appearance comparable with the appearance of invasive breast cancer in MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Ductal <e>CIS</e> lesions show typical morphological and kinetic, but heterogeneous, characteristics in MRI, comparable with the histopathological variety of the disease. For detecting pure DCIS cases early and precisely, a combination of dynamic and morphological criteria seems to be important.",M1
17996359,"Noninvasive detection of testicular carcinoma in situ in semen using OCT3/4.OBJECTIVE: Carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) is accepted as the precursor of the germ cell tumors of the adult testis. CIS cells are located within the seminiferous tubules and can be exfoliated into semen. We performed a study to detect CIS cells in semen using the highly specific immunohistochemical marker OCT3/4, potentially a method for noninvasive diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 2006, 41 men at risk for CIS of the testis were found eligible for this study. Indications for inclusions were a suspicious lesion on scrotal ultrasound investigation (n=14), patients on surveillance after a history of a testicular tumor (n=14), and 13 patients with bilateral testicular microlithiasis (TM). RESULTS: Three of the 13 men (23%) who underwent testicular biopsies for bilateral TM were histologically diagnosed with CIS (two bilateral), and their semen showed OCT3/4-positive cells in all cases. Twelve of the 14 patients (86%) with a solid mass were diagnosed with a TGCT with adjacent CIS in the parenchyma, and in 9 cases (75%) OCT3/4-positive cells were present in the semen. No OCT3/4-positive cells were found in patients with biopsies who did not show any evidence of malignancy. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that OCT3/4-positive cells can be found in semen from the majority of patients with CIS. The observations indicate that there is probably a time window in which the CIS cells are exfoliated, which gives an opportunity for early detection of CIS cells in semen of men at risk for TGCT.",M1
17989344,"Chromosomal aneusomy in bronchial high-grade lesions is associated with invasive lung cancer.RATIONALE: The development of lung cancer (LC) is accompanied by field changes in the airway mucosa that may have prognostic importance. OBJECTIVES: To compare patients with prevalent LC to control subjects regarding their histologic dysplasia scores and chromosomal aneusomy as measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). METHODS: The most advanced bronchial histology lesion was assessed from each of 44 LC cases and 90 cancer-free control subjects using a four-color FISH probe set encompassing the chromosome 6 centromere, 5p15.2, 7p12 (epidermal growth factor receptor), and 8q24 v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) sequences. Histology grades were coded as dysplasia (moderate or severe) or carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: CIS was the highest histologic grade for 32 subjects, and dysplasia was the highest grade for 102 subjects (54 moderate, 48 severe). Chromosomal aneusomy was seen in 64% of the LC cases, but in only 31% of the control subjects (odds ratio [OR], 4.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]. 1.97-11.04). Among those with any level of dysplasia, the OR for positive FISH and LC was 2.28 (95% CI, 0.75-6.86). Among those with CIS, the OR for positive FISH and LC was 5.84 (95% CI, 1.31-26.01). CONCLUSIONS: Chromosomal aneusomy is associated with LC. Prospective examination of aneusomy as a precursor lesion that predicts LC is needed.",M1
17962638,"Molecular predictive factors for progression of high-grade preinvasive bronchial lesions.RATIONALE: The outcome of precancerous bronchial lesions is not well known, and their management is subject to controversy. Many molecular alterations are present in preinvasive lesions, but none has been assessed to predict the evolution of the lesions. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the outcome of high-grade precancerous lesions according to their molecular profile. METHODS: Twenty-three severe dysplasia and 31 carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) lesions in 37 patients were monitored using repeated autofluorescence bronchoscopy over a 12-year period. Microdissection and polymerase chain reaction analysis were performed on paraffin tissue sections to assess loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability on chromosome 3p, 5q, and 9p. Histology and molecular status at baseline were compared between 7 lesions that became invasive, 11 that relapsed after treatment, 17 that were eradicated with local treatment, and 19 that spontaneously regressed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ninety-four percent of lesions that progressed or relapsed were CIS at baseline, whereas 79% of spontaneously regressing lesions were severe dysplasia (P &lt; 0.0001). 3p and 9p LOH was more frequent in CIS than in severe dysplasia (P = 0.03). In the whole group of lesions as well as in the CIS group, 3p LOH was strongly associated with progression (P &lt; 0.0001 and P = 0.02, respectively). Microsatellite instability was not associated with the outcome of the lesions. A therapeutic strategy based on the presence of 3p or 9p LOH would have led to overtreatment of six lesions but would have missed only 1 among the 18 progressing lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline histology and 3p LOH analysis appear to be useful in predicting the outcome of high-grade precancerous lesions.",M1
17961334,"[Prognostic factors of cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions treated by cold knife conization with negative margin]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic factors of cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions treated by cold knife conization with negative margin. METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-six women with cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions treated by cold-knife conization with negative margins at Beijing Hospital between Jan 1999 and Jan 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were followed up with cytology, high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) test and colposcopy if necessary. RESULTS: The cervical CIN recurrence rate was 8.6% with no incidence of invasive cervical cancer after a median follow-up of 46 months. The recurrence was related to the grade of lesions and gland involvement pathologically. One of 20 (5.0%) cases with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II, 9 of 164 (5.5%) cases with CIN III (excluding carcinoma in situ, <e>CIS</e>) and 13 of 82 (15.8%) cases with CIS recurred (P &lt; 0.05). Seven of 40 (17.5%) cases with gland involvement and 16 of 226 (6.0%) cases without gland involvement recurred (P &lt; 0.05). High-risk HPV tests were performed in 257 of 266 cases before surgery. Twenty one of 244 cases (8.6%) with positive high-risk HPV recurred and none of 13 cases with negative test recurred. CONCLUSIONS: There are few recurrences for cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions treated by cold knife conization with negative margins. Close follow-up is needed for those high grade lesions and those with gland involvement.",M1
17957781,"The association between oral contraceptive use and lobular and ductal breast cancer in young women.Recent reports indicate that the incidence of lobular breast cancer is increasing at a faster rate than ductal breast cancer, which may be due to the differential effects of exogenous hormones by histology. To address this issue, we examined whether the relationship between oral contraceptive use and incident breast cancer differs between lobular and ductal subtypes in young women. A population-based sample of in situ and invasive breast cancer cases between ages 20 and 44 were recruited from Atlanta, GA; Seattle-Puget Sound, WA and central New Jersey. Controls were sampled from the same areas by random-digit dialing, and were frequency matched to the expected case age distribution. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% <e>CIs</e>) were calculated using polytomous logistic regression. Among the 100 lobular cancers, 1,164 ductal cancers, and 1,501 controls, the odds ratios for oral contraceptive ever use were 1.10 (95% CI = 0.68-1.78) for lobular cancers and 1.21 (95% CI = 1.01-1.45) for ductal cancers, adjusted for study site, age at diagnosis, and pap screening history. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the association between ever use of oral contraceptives and breast cancer in young women does not vary strongly by histologic subtype. These results are similar to previous studies that report little difference in the effect of oral contraceptive use on breast cancer by histology.",M1
17956523,"Bladder sparing approach for initial T1G3 bladder cancer: Do multifocality, size of tumor or concomitant carcinoma in situ matter? A long-term analysis of 132 patients.OBJECTIVES: In T1 bladder cancer (BC) multifocality, size of tumor (&gt; or =3 cm) and concomitant carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) are used to stratify patients' risk. We compared the long-term results in patients with initial T1G3 bc treated with transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillations and repeat resection with special regard to these clinical risk factors. The aim was to determine if they influence the outcome in the bladder sparing approach for initial T1G3 bc. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-two consecutive patients with initial T1G3 and no prior history of BC were identified. All patients completed six weekly adjuvant BCG instillations followed by control TURB. Follow-up consisted of cystoscopy with bladder wash cytology every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months thereafter. RESULTS: Forty-two percent of patients had residual disease, 65% developed recurrence of any stage and 41% had progression to muscle-invasive disease. Cancer-specific survival was 89% and 78% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Only CIS was significantly correlated with all end points on multivariate analysis. While the presence of one or two risk factors was not related to recurrence, progression or cancer-related death, the presence of all three risk factors predicted the latter. CONCLUSIONS: While no guideline has been established for the decision between cystectomy and bladder sparing, concomitant CIS and the presence of all three risk factors together seem to predict an adverse oncological outcome in the bladder sparing approach.",M1
17873170,"Bronchial intraepithelial neoplasia/early central airways lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition).BACKGROUND: An evidence-based approach is necessary for the localization and management of intraepithelial and microinvasive non-small cell lung cancer in the central airways. METHODS: Material appropriate to this topic was obtained by literature search of a computerized database. Recommendations were developed by the writing committee and then reviewed by the entire guidelines panel. The final recommendations were made by the Chair and were voted on by the entire committee. RESULTS: White light bronchoscopy has diagnostic limitations in the detection of microinvasive lesions. Autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) is a technique that has been shown to be a sensitive method for detecting these lesions. In patients with moderate dysplasia or worse on sputum cytology and normal chest radiographic findings, bronchoscopy should be performed. If moderate/severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) is detected in the central airways, then bronchoscopic surveillance is recommended. The use of AFB is preferred if available. In a patient being considered for curative endobronchial therapy to treat microinvasive lesions, AFB is useful. A number of endobronchial techniques as therapeutic options are available for the management of CIS and can be recommended to patients with inoperable disease. In patients with operable disease, surgery remains the mainstay of treatment, although patients may be counseled about these techniques. CONCLUSIONS: AFB is a useful tool for the localization of microinvasive neoplasia. A number of endobronchial techniques available for the curative treatment can be considered first-line therapy in inoperable cases. For operable cases, the techniques may be considered and discussed with the patients.",M1
17875493,"Tumor risk in disorders of sex development (DSD).Disorders of sex development (DSD), previously referred to as intersex disorders, comprise a variety of anomalies defined by congenital conditions in which chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Besides issues such as gender assignment, clinical and diagnostic evaluation, surgical and psychosocial management, and sex steroid replacement, the significantly increased risk for developing specific types of malignancies is both clinically and biologically relevant. This relates to germ-cell tumors specifically in DSD patients with hypovirilization or gonadal dysgenesis. The presence of a well-defined part of the Y chromosome (known as the GBY region) is a prerequisite for malignant transformation, for which the testis-specific protein on the Y chromosome (TSPY) is a likely candidate gene. The precursor lesions of these cancers are carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>)/intratubular germ-cell neoplasia unclassified (ITGCNU) in testicular tissue and gonadoblastoma in those without obvious testicular differentiation. Most recently, undifferentiated gonadal tissue (UGT) has been identified as the likely precursor for gonadoblastoma. The availability of markers for the different developmental stages of germ cells allows detailed investigation of the characteristics of normal and (pre)malignant germ cells. Although informative in a diagnostic setting for adult male patients, these markers - such as OCT3/4 - cannot easily distinguish (pre)malignant germ cells from germ cells showing delayed maturation. This latter phenomenon is frequently found in gonads of DSD patients, and may be related to the risk of malignant transformation. Thus, the mere application of these markers might result in over-diagnosis and unnecessary gonadectomy. It is proposed that morphological and histological evaluation of gonadal tissue, in combination with OCT3/4 and TSPY double immunohistochemistry and clinical parameters, is most informative in estimating the risk for germ-cell tumor development in the individual patient, and might in future be used to develop a decision tree for optimal management of patients with DSD.",M1
17705813,"Testicular carcinoma in situ in subfertile Danish men.Carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) testis is the precursor stage for the majority of testicular germ cell tumours (TGCT). Infertility is one of the conditions known to predispose to TGCT, but based on scarce existing data, the prevalence of CIS in this risk group was estimated at only approximately 1%. To establish more objective data, we investigated retrospectively the prevalence of CIS based on testicular biopsies performed in a well-defined group of subfertile males. We included 453 patients who had testicular biopsies performed for infertility reasons during 1995-2005 at the Copenhagen University Hospital (Rigshospitalet). Biopsies were evaluated by two experienced observers independently. CIS was detected in 10 individuals, of whom three had bilateral CIS, corresponding to a prevalence of 2.2% (95% CI 1.1-4.0%). This is greater than the estimated risk of 0.45% for the age- and birth cohort-matched general Danish population. All patients with CIS testis had severe oligozoospermia (&lt;/=2.06 million/mL). We confirmed that a thorough examination of men suffering from subfertility/infertility can identify those with an increased risk for testicular neoplasia and recommend performing bilateral biopsies, especially in the subpopulation of men with atrophic testicles, severe oligozoospermia and/or irregular ultrasonic pattern of their testicles.",M1
17705812,"Current approaches for detection of carcinoma in situ testis.Testicular germ cell tumours have a favourable prognosis if detected early, but are potentially lethal in a subset of patients. Multi-modality treatment is often necessary, thus the preferable time of diagnosis is at the pre-invasive, but unfortunately often asymptomatic precursor stage of carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). This review describes current possible approaches for the detection of CIS. At present, an open testicular biopsy is the only definitive way of establishing the presence of CIS. The tissue section should be of an adequate size, be properly fixed, and evaluation be supported by at least one solid immunohistochemical marker, for example PLAP, OCT-3/4 or AP-2gamma. Determination of who should be offered testicular biopsies is based on clinical and ultrasonic examination along with the evaluation of risk factors. A surgical biopsy is an invasive procedure with potential complications, although rare. Therefore, a noninvasive and equally reliable method is needed. Testicular ultrasound is risk-free, painless and at present the only noninvasive method of aid for andrologists when CIS is suspected. The presence of testicular microlithiasis is, in some cases, indicative of pre-malignant changes, especially in males with additional risk factors. Promising results have recently been obtained with a novel noninvasive detection method based on immunocytological AP-2gamma-staining of CIS cells in semen. This method could be a supporting method in andrology centres where careful follow-up is possible. In conclusion, one difficulty is to determine in which males CIS should be suspected; secondly, there does not as yet exist an optimal noninvasive method of diagnosis that is more acceptable than an open surgical biopsy.",M1
17700252,"Cigarette smoking and risk of breast carcinoma in situ.BACKGROUND: Although the associations with cigarette smoking have been explored extensively for invasive breast cancer, the relation to in situ cancer has not previously been examined in depth. METHODS: We analyzed data from a population-based case-control study of women living in Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Eligible cases of incident breast carcinoma in situ were reported to statewide registries in 1997-2001 (n = 1878); similarly aged controls (n = 8041) were randomly selected from population lists. Smoking history and other risk factor information were collected through structured telephone interviews. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% <e>CIs</e>) were calculated from logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: In multivariate models, the OR for breast carcinoma in situ among current smokers was 0.8, compared with never-smokers (95% CI = 0.7-1.0). Risk estimates increased towards the null with greater time since smoking cessation. Odds ratios were also less than 1.0 among women who initiated smoking in adolescence (OR = 0.8) or after a full-term birth (OR = 0.7), relative to women who never smoked. The reduced odds ratios associated with current smoking were strongest among women with annual screening mammograms (OR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.6-0.9). Odds ratios were not less than 1.0 among current smokers without a recent screening mammogram (1.3; 0.9-2.0). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest an inverse association between current smoking and risk of breast carcinoma in situ among women undergoing breast cancer screening.",M1
17696752,"Line-1 hypomethylation in multistage carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate characteristics of global hypomethylation in evolution of cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and seven cases of carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) were studied. Each of the SCC samples contained CIS, and all SCC and CIS samples contained normal ectocervical epithelium. Microdissection was performed to separate normal epithelium, CIS and SCC prior to DNA extraction. Hypomethylation levels of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1 or L1) were measured with a combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) PCR (polymerase chain reaction) protocol. The percentage of L1 hypomethylation for SCC, CIS and normal epithelium was compared. RESULTS: In the SCC cohort, the L1 hypomethylation level showed progressive increase comparing normal epithelium (59.4 +/- 8.86%) to CIS (64.37 +/- 7.32%) and SCC (66.3 +/- 7.26%) (repeated measurement ANOVA, P = 0.005). A significantly greater L1 hypomethylation level was found in CIS (62.06 +/- 3.44 %) compared to normal epithelium (60.03 +/- 3.69 %) (paired t-Test, P = 0.03). No significant difference in L1 hypomethylation level was noted between CIS of the two sample groups (unpaired t-Test, P = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, there was a significant correlation between the degree of hypomethylation and progression from normal ectocervical mucosa to CIS and invasive cancer. Laboratory assessment of biopsies for this molecular event may have clinical significance.",M1
17695465,"Qualitative DNA differences between two structurally different lesions: high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma in situ in colorectal adenomas.BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that the Vienna classification of neoplasias in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract acknowledged low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) and that most Western pathologists recognize CIS in many organs, both CIS and HGD are still used synonymously in colorectal adenomas. Differences between CIS and HGD in colorectal adenomas are reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five large colorectal adenomas (measuring &gt;20 mm) having areas of both HGD and CIS were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and with Feulgen stains. RESULTS: The HGD areas showed tightly packed, spindle shaped, hyperchromatic cells with slight to moderate pleomorphic nuclei having coarse chromatin. In contrast, the CIS cells displayed marked pleomorphism, large vesicular nuclei and a prominent nucleolus. In H&amp;E stain the hyperchromasia found in HGD nuclei was much less evident in CIS nuclei. The HGD nuclei were intensively stained (+++) with the DNA-specific Feulgen reaction but the CIS nuclei were not. CONCLUSION: It would appear that following the completion of chromosomal mutations in the nuclei of HGD-cells, their DNA, carrying the new genetic information, is transcribed into RNA in the nuclei of CIS. Thus, through messenger-RNA, the production of mutated cytoplasmic proteins, required for the ultimate invasion of the lamina propria mucosa (and beyond), would be triggered.",M1
17693577,"Value of multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (UroVysion) in the differential diagnosis of flat urothelial lesions.AIMS: During the past 10 years, multitarget fluorescence in situ hybridisation has been established as a valuable adjunct in the cytological diagnosis of precancerous and malignant lesions of the urinary tract. The aim of the present study was to define its value in detecting chromosomal imbalances in patients with various flat urothelial lesions in routine paraffin-embedded bladder biopsy samples. In addition, the HER2 gene amplification and HER2 expression pattern were examined, since alterations of the HER2 expression patterns have been demonstrated in invasive bladder cancer. METHODS: 29 samples of normal urothelium and 86 flat urothelial lesions (hyperplasia, reactive atypia, dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>)) from 73 patients were analysed patients using tissue microarrays and centromeric probes for chromosomes 3, 7 and 17, and gene-specific probes for 9p21/P16 and HER2 (UroVysion, PathVysion). The expression of HER2 was studied by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Polysomy of at least one of the chromosomes was found in about half of the dysplastic cells, and in more than 90% of cells in CIS or cells in invasive bladder tumours. Polysomic cells were found in only 17% of urothelial hyperplasia, reactive atypia and normal urothelium of healthy patients, whereas about 30% of non-neoplastic lesions in patients with concomitant urothelial carcinoma showed polysomy of at least one chromosome. These alterations indicate a field effect and are associated with synchronous development of dysplastic lesions of a higher grade. Deletion of the P16 locus was most frequently observed in aneuploid lesions, whereas overexpression of HER2 was found in 10-20% of invasive urothelial carcinomas, and only occasionally in CIS (5%). An altered HER2 expression pattern was present in non-neoplastic lesions (25%). CONCLUSIONS: UroVysion fluorescence in situ hybridisation is a valuable tool for the detection of genetically unstable flat urothelial lesions, and can help to resolve difficult cases, particularly the differential diagnosis of reactive atypia and dysplasia.",M1
17672936,"[Expression and significance of P16INK4A and PTEN in high-risk human papillomavirus-related cervical cancer]BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the most important etiologic factor for cervical cancer. Recent studies have revealed that abnormal expression of tumor suppressor gene P16INK4A is closely associated with HR-HPV infection during carcinogenesis of cervical epithelium. Tumor suppressor gene PTEN is also involved in cervical tumorigenesis. This study was to investigate the correlations of HR-HPV infection to P16INK4A and PTEN expression and its clinical significance in the carcinogenesis of cervical epithelium. METHODS: The expression of P16INK4A and PTEN in 30 specimens of normal cervical tissues, 11 specimens of cancer in situ (<e>CIS</e>), and 24 specimens of invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC) was detected by SP immunohistochemistry; 13 types of HR-HPV DNA in these cases were detected by Hybrid Capture 2 (HC-2) assay. RESULTS: The positive rates of HR-HPV and P16INK4A were significantly higher in ICC and CIS than in normal tissues (91.7% and 90.9% vs. 30.0%, P&lt;0.001; 87.5% and 81.8% vs. 6.7%, P&lt;0.001). Both HR-HPV DNA and P16INK4A overexpression (moderate or strong expression) were observed simultaneously in 21 specimens of ICC and 9 specimens of CIS; they were simultaneously negative in 20 specimens of normal cervical tissues and 1 specimen of CIS and 2 specimens of ICC. Overexpression of P16INK4A was positively correlated to HR-HPV infection in cervical cancer (rs = 0.690, P&lt;0.001). PTEN was moderately or strongly expressed in 26 specimens of normal cervical tissues. The positive rate of PTEN was significantly lower in ICC and CIS than in normal cervical tissues (37.5% and 36.4% vs. 83.3%, P&lt;0.01). No obvious relationship between PTEN and HR-HPV was found (rs = -0.174, P = 0.167). CONCLUSIONS: P16INK4A is overexpressed in HR-HPV-infected cervical cancer, but its tumor suppressor action might be inhibited. In contrast, the functional down-regulation of PTEN contributes to cervical tumorigenesis through HR-HPV-independent mechanism.",M1
17652955,"p53 Mutation analysis of low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ of the esophagus using laser capture microdissection.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and to analyze the characteristics of p53 point mutation in esophageal intraepithelial lesions. METHODS: p53 Immunohistochemical and genetic analyses were performed on histopathologically and morphometrically diagnosed lesions. Laser capture microdissection samples were used for increased accuracy. RESULTS: Of the 70 lesions studied, 21 were high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ (HGD/<e>CIS</e>), 21 low-grade dysplasia (LGD), 16 reactive atypical epithelia (RAE) and 12 normal epithelia (NE). Immunohistochemical staining showed p53 protein accumulation in 86% (18/21) of HGD/CIS, 81% (17/21) of LGD, and in none of RAE and NE. p53 point mutation was detected in 71% (15/21) of HGD/CIS, 67% (14/21) of LGD, but in none of RAE and NE. Of HGD/CIS and LGD with p53 protein accumulation, similar percentages had mutations: 83% (15/18) and 82% (14/17), respectively. Of lesions with mutations, 72% (21/29) had mutations at hot spots such as codons 238, 248, 273 and 282. CONCLUSIONS: p53 Point mutation prevalent in HGD/CIS was also present in a large number of LGD. This is strong evidence that LGD is a neoplastic lesion and that p53 point mutation is deeply involved in esophageal carcinogenesis.",M1
17641799,"Molecular changes in superficial bladder cancer.Urinary bladder cancers represent a spectrum of diseases that can be grouped into three general categories: superficial, invasive and metastasis. Each differs in clinical behavior, prognosis and primary management. For superficial tumors, the aim is to prevent recurrences and progression to an incurable stage, recognizing that surgical removal of the bladder (over treatment for most tumors) is curative up to a point. For more invasive disease, the issue becomes how to determine which tumors can be cured with a single therapy such as surgery, and which, by virtue of a high metastatic potential, requires an integrated systemic approach to achieve cure. For metastatic disease, combination chemotherapy is the standard yet, despite responses in more than 50% of cases, overall cure rates remain low, and progression has been minimal over the past few years. We analyzed histopathological and immunohistochemical 70 patients with bladder carcinomas searching the stage, the grade and other associated lesions. The results showed that 70% were papillary transitional carcinomas infiltrated in lamina propria (T1), and almost 22.85% represent non-invasive papillary carcinomas (Ta); we found only five cases in Tis stage (7.15%). The immunohistochemistry investigated three antibodies: p53 oncoprotein, bcl-2 oncoprotein and retinoblastoma protein (pRb). We noticed the antibodies distribution related to stage: carcinoma in situ (<e>Cis</e> or Tis) high percent of p53 (69) and bcl-2 (37.5%). Concerning the superficial tumors we found low values of p53 in T1 (45%) versus invasive tumors (51%); oncoprotein bcl-2 is higher in T1 (35%) versus non-invasive one (6%).",M1

Twenty tumours were positive for both PAS and PLAP and were therefore diagnosed as classical seminoma (SE). The other 23 tumours were negative for both PAS and PLAP and were therefore diagnosed as spermatocytic seminoma (SS).

17626749,"[Dysregulation of Annexin II expression in esophageal squamous cell cancer and adjacent tissues from a high-incidence area for esophageal cancer in Henan province]BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Our recent study on proteomics for esophageal cancer has indicated the importance of Annexin II as a promising protein to distinguish esophageal cancer patients from healthy subjects. This study was to detect the expression of Annexin II in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and adjacent tissues, and to explore the role of Annexin II in ESCC pathogenesis and mechanisms. METHODS: The expression of Annexin I in 33 specimens of ESCC and adjacent tissues from Linzhou, a high-incidence area for esophageal cancer in Henan province, was detected by ABC immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Annexin II protein was expressed in 90.6% normal esophageal epithelium and decreased with ESCC progression. In carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), 50.0% foci lost Annexin II protein expression. The expression of Annexin II protein was increased in well differentiated SCC and decreased with loss of differentiation of SCC. In poorly differentiated SCC, 45.4% foci lost Annexin II protein expression. However, RT-PCR did not detect differential expression of Annexin II mRNA between normal esophageal epithelium and CIS. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated or reduced expression of Annexin II may be correlated to reverse or progression of carcinogenesis respectively, and Annexin II may be another candidate biomarker for screening of high-risk subjects and early diagnosis of SCC.",M1
17619739,"Natural history, recurrence, and progression in superficial bladder cancer.Superficial bladder cancer encompasses patients with stage Ta T1 tumors and patients with carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). The natural history or treatment-related prognosis of these patients varies considerably from one patient to the next based on the patient's clinical and the tumor's pathological characteristics. Based on a review of the literature, the most important prognostic factors for recurrence are the prior recurrence rate, number of tumors, and tumor size; whereas for progression, the most important prognostic factors are the T category, grade, and presence of CIS. Treatment with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin reduces both the risk of recurrence and the risk of progression, and is the treatment of choice in high-risk papillary tumors and in patients with CIS. Assessment of a patient's prognostic factors and his or her risk of recurrence and progression is a prerequisite for determining the most appropriate treatment and frequency of follow-up for a given patient.",M1

17573848,"DNA damage response in human testes and testicular germ cell tumours: biology and implications for therapy.DNA damage response (DDR) is emerging as a physiological anti-cancer barrier in early stages of cancer development, as shown for several types of solid cancers derived from somatic cells. Here we discuss our recently published and unpublished results on the exceptional paucity of such constitutive activation of the DDR machinery in human testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs), including their common pre-invasive stage of carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>). Our conclusions are supported by immunohistochemical analyses of multiple markers of activated DNA damage signalling, such as the phosphorylated ATM and Chk2 checkpoint kinases and phosphorylated histone H2AX. We propose that the unique lack of DDR activation in TGCTs reflects the biology of their cell of origin, the gonocyte. Furthermore, we propose that the lack of DDR activation avoids the pressure to select for mutations in DDR genes such as p53 or ATM, and the resulting intact DDR machinery may have implications for the exceptional curability of TGCTs by DNA damaging therapies.",M1
17541442,"Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the urinary tract: a clinicopathological study of 30 pure and mixed cases.We studied 28 cases of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the bladder, one case in the renal pelvis, and one in the urethra. The mean age of the patients was 67.6 years with 21 (70%) males. Seventeen cases (56.7%) were pure with the remaining mixed with other patterns of carcinoma, including invasive urothelial carcinoma (n=10), invasive adenocarcinoma (n=3), and squamous cell carcinoma (n=2). The surface demonstrated carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) in six cases, noninvasive high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma in three cases, and in situ adenocarcinoma in one case. In 19/30 (66%) cases, there was a heavy lymphocytic infiltrate and in the remaining 11/30 (34%) cases a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. None of the 26 cases labeled for EBV-encoded RNA by in situ hybridization. Tumor stages at presentation were: seven cases T1 (23%); 14 cases T2 (47%); seven cases T3 (23%); and two cases T4 (7%). Treatment consisted of radical cystectomy in 13/30 cases (43%); partial cystectomy in 4/30 cases (13%); nephrectomy in one case (3%), and transurethral resection often followed by radiation or chemotherapy in 12/30 (40%) cases. The mean follow up for patients without progression was 31 months. Eight of 27 cases with follow-up (30%) cases had tumor recurrence, with seven patients having metastases. In cases treated with cystectomy, the 5-year actuarial recurrence-free risk was 59% (62 and 57%, for pure and mixed cases, respectively). Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma, whether in pure or mixed form, has a similar prognosis to ordinary urothelial carcinoma when treated by cystectomy. Of the three pure cases treated by chemotherapy, two were free of disease at 4 and 65 months and the third had recurrent disease at 17 months. Given the association of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma with urothelial carcinoma in 47% of our cases and its propensity for multifocality, partial cystectomy would typically be ill advised for lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.",M1
17495352,"P53 mutations in urinary bladder cancer patients from Central Poland.The present study aimed at detection of P53 gene mutations in cells of urinary bladder neoplasms, as the mutations may be regarded as an independent prognostic factor for progression and recurrence of tumours. In the study, 82 patients with clinically diagnosed urinary bladder tumour were included. The control was composed of DNA samples from urine and blood of 202 healthy patients. Exons 5-8 of the P53 gene were screened for mutations by using multitemperature single-strand conformational polymorphism (MSSCP) analysis. Samples with abnormal MSSCP patterns were subjected to direct sequencing. The frequency of mutations in exons 5-8 of the P53 gene in patients with bladder cancer was lower (3.3% in grade G1, 24% in G2, and 39% in G3) than the data reported in the literature. We found a higher percentage of polymorphism at codon 213 of the P53 gene in bladder cancer patients (6%), compared with the values in the reference group (2.5%). These results were matched with those of the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis. In conclusion, mutations were found mainly in more advanced histopathological and clinical stages of the disease and at the <e>CIS</e> stage (carcinoma in situ). It cannot be excluded that the observed polymorphism at codon 213 may be a predisposing factor for urinary bladder carcinoma development.",M1
17488342,"Improved gene expression signature of testicular carcinoma in situ.The carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) stage is the common precursor of testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) that arise in young adults. Within the past decade genome wide gene expression tools have been developed and have greatly advanced the insight into the biology of TGCTs. Two independent data sets on global gene expression in testicular CIS have been previously published. We have merged the two data sets on CIS samples (n = 6) and identified the shared gene expression signature in relation to expression in normal testis. Among the top-20 highest expressed genes, one-third was transcription factors and the list included some 'novel' CIS markers (i.e. DOCK11 and ANXA3). Genes related to biological terms 'nucleic acid binding' and 'translational activity' (e.g. transcription factors and ribosomal proteins, respectively) were consistently and significantly over-represented. Some of the significantly over-expressed genes in CIS cells were selected for validation by RT-PCR (IFI16, DOCK11, and ANXA3), immunohistochemistry (HLXB9), or in situ hybridization (IFI16). High-level analysis utilizing the Ingenuity pathway analysis tool indicated that networks relating to 'gene expression in cancer' and 'embryonic development' were significantly altered and could collectively affect cellular pathways like the WNT signalling cascade, which thus may be disrupted in testicular CIS. The merged CIS data from two different microarray platforms, to our knowledge, provide the most precise CIS gene expression signature to date.",M1
17486054,"Cystic lesions of the pancreas.Although cystic tumors of the pancreas are relatively rare, they constitute an increasingly important category. Advances in imaging and interventional techniques and the sharp drop in the mortality rate of pancreatic surgery have rendered pancreatic biopsies and resections commonplace specimens. Consequently, in the past two decades, the nature of many cystic tumors in this organ has been better characterized. The names of some existing entities were revised; for example, what was known as papillary-cystic tumor is now regarded as solid-pseudopapillary tumor. New entities, in particular, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and its variants, such as oncocytic and intestinal subtypes were recognized. The importance of clinical and pathologic correlation in the evaluation of these lesions was appreciated, in particular, with regards to the multifocality of these lesions, their association with invasive carcinomas, and thus their 'preinvasive' nature. Consensus criteria for the distinction of these from the ordinary precursors of adenocarcinoma, the pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, were established. The definition of mucinous cystic neoplasms was refined; ovarian-like stroma has now become almost a requirement for the diagnosis of mucinous cystic neoplasia, and defined as such, the propensity of these tumors to occur in perimenopausal women became even more striking. The validity and clinical value of classifying the pancreatic cysts of mucinous type as adenoma, borderline, <e>CIS</e> and invasive have been established. Related to this, the importance of thorough sampling in accurate classification of these mucinous lesions was recognized. Greater accessibility of the pancreas afforded by improved invasive as well as noninvasive modalities has also increased the detection of otherwise clinically silent cystic tumors, which has led to the recognition of more innocuous entities such as acinar cell cystadenoma and squamoid cyst of pancreatic ducts. As the significance of the cystic lesions emerged, cystic forms of otherwise typically solid tumors were also better characterized. Thus, significant developments have taken place in the classification and our understanding of pancreatic cystic tumors in the past few years, and experience with these lesions is likely to grow exponentially in the coming years.",M1

TM was defined as multiple small hyperechogenic foci. Only images of the tumor-free testis were reviewed. In addition, archived biopsy specimens of the contralateral testicle were reviewed after immunostaining for placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) as a marker for CIS. RESULTS: TM was diagnosed in 11 (26.8%) patients. Of them, microliths were pathologically confirmed in only 2. Prevalence of CIS was higher in patients with TM (2 of 11 patients) than in those without TM (0 of 30 patients, p = 0.017) CONCLUSION: TM was associated with testicular tumor. TM in the contralateral testis of patients with unilateral testicular tumor may increase the risk of CIS.",M1
17419275,"Analysis of clinicopathological features and predictors of malignancy in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are increasingly recognized, but it is very difficult to evaluate accurately the malignancy of these neoplasms by modern imaging. We reviewed our experience in order to elucidate predictors of tumor malignancy, invasiveness, and outcome. METHODOLOGY: The clinicopathological features and surgical outcomes of 57 patients with IPMNs who underwent surgery in Nagoya University Hospital were analyzed. RESULTS: The histological diagnosis was adenoma in 40, borderline in 1, carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) in 7, and invasive carcinoma in 9 patients. Patients with invasive carcinomas had significantly shorter survival rates than patients with benign IPMNs or CIS (p &lt; 0.0001). Multivariate analyses revealed that the main duct or the combined type was significantly predictive of malignancy, and both main duct or combined type and diabetes mellitus were associated significantly with invasive carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: IPMNs generally grow slowly, but have a malignant potential that warrants radical surgical treatment when the tumor component invades the parenchyma. Our results suggest that the above factors should be considered in surgical management. The main duct type of IPMN or IPMN with mural nodules is potentially malignant or invasive. Therefore, radical operative management is indicated in these IPMNs.",M1
17397491,"Is urinary tract cytology still useful for diagnosis of bladder carcinomas? A large series of 592 bladder washings using a five-category classification of different cytological diagnoses.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the efficiency of a recent five-category urinary cytological classification. METHODS: A total of 592 bladder washings were fixed immediately with Saccomanno's fixative. All samples were centrifuged in a Hettich cyto-centrifuge. For each sample, the reference standard was the histology when a lesion was present at the time of cystoscopy. A five-category cytological classification was used: negative, suspicious of low (S-Lg) or high (S-Hg) grade neoplasia and consistent with low (Lg) or high (Hg) grade neoplasia. RESULTS: For cytological diagnoses of S-Lg and Lg, sensitivity was 37% and specificity was 95% for the histological diagnosis of low-grade non-invasive urothelial papillary tumour (Lg-UPT), which included papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential and low-grade urothelial carcinoma. For cytological diagnosis of S-Hg and Hg, sensitivity was 44% for high-grade non-invasive urothelial papillary carcinoma (Hg-UPC), 70% for carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) and 81% for invasive carcinoma (T1 and higher). Specificity was 99% in each case. Cytological diagnosis of S-Hg or Hg was not found for Lg-UPT (0/59) and no cytological diagnosis of S-Lg or Lg was found for invasive carcinoma, but was seen for Hg-UPC in 10% (3/28) and for CIS in 6% (3/50) of cases. CONCLUSION: Despite the absence of international consensus, the recent five-category cytological classification for urine is accurate for current urological practice.",M1
17381801,"Actinic cheilitis: histologic study of the entire vermilion and comparison with previous biopsy.BACKGROUND: Actinic cheilitis (AC), is the very superficial, incipient form of actinically induced squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip. Few studies of actinic cheilitis analyzed the entire lip vermilion searching for microscopic areas of progressing carcinoma. METHODS: Twenty patients with biopsy proved actinic cheilitis presenting with diffuse clinical changes were submitted to vermilionectomy of lower lip. Surgical specimens were sectioned every 3 mm, studied histopathologically and findings were compared with the biopsy. Histological findings were classified as 'AC', carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>), superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SISCC), and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ISCC). RESULTS: Comparison between biopsies and most severe changes on vermilionectomies revealed coincidental changes in 10 cases (50%), more severe changes on biopsy occurred in two cases (10%) and in eight cases (40%) the changes on vermilionectomy were more severe. SISCC was diagnosed in nine cases (45%): of these, two had been detected on biopsy, six had shown a milder aspect on biopsy, and in one biopsy had shown ISCC. Foci of discontinuous areas of SISCC were detected in four cases (20%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that cases of AC presenting with poorly demarcated lesions may bear severe histopathological changes irregularly distributed along the vermilion.",M1
17340590,"PD-L1 (B7-H1) expression by urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and BCG-induced granulomata: associations with localized stage progression.BACKGROUND: PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1, B7-H1) is a cell surface glycoprotein that can impair T-cell function. PD-L1 is aberrantly expressed by multiple human malignancies and has been shown to carry a highly unfavorable prognosis in patients with kidney cancer. The role of PD-L1 was evaluated as a mechanism for local stage progression in urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, PD-L1 expression was evaluated in a cohort of 280 high-risk UCs of the bladder. PD-L1 was modeled as a predictor of bladder cancer stage using ordinal logistic regression. Other covariates evaluated as potential confounders included age, gender, tumor grade, and lymphocytic infiltration. Further, PD-L1 was evaluated as a potential mechanism of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) failure in the subset of high-risk nonmuscle-invasive tumors that received this treatment. RESULTS: PD-L1 expression was observed in 7% of pTa, 16% of pT1, 23% of pT2, 30% of pT3/4, and 45% of carcinoma in situ (<e>CIS</e>) tumors. PD-L1 expression was associated with high-grade tumors (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4, P = .009) and tumor infiltration by mononuclear cells (OR = 5.5, P = .004). We observed that the key determinants of stage progression in this cohort were World Health Organization/International Society of Urologic Pathology (WHO/ISUP) high-grade tumor pathology (OR = 4.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.73-8.34; P &lt; .001) and PD-L1 expression (OR = 2.20, P = .012). PD-L1 expression was found to be extremely abundant in the BCG-induced bladder granulomata in 11 of 12 patients failing BCG treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data indicate that tumor PD-L1 may facilitate localized stage-advancement of UC and attenuate responses to BCG immunotherapy by neutralizing T cells that normally guard against cancer invasion from the epithelium into the bladder musculature.",M1

The analysis was carried out in 141 antiretroviral-naive individuals. Low frequency (less than 1%) of primary drug resistance mutations was shown. However, high frequencies of secondary mutations V77I in protease and A62V in RT (67% H 63%, respectively) linked to each other in most cases were observed. The HIV-1 isolates bearing both substitutions (MutV77I/A62V) were also characterized by the presence of several synonymous mutations, suggesting common origin for these viruses. HIV Biochip Hybridization microarray and/or Restriction fragment-length polymorphism analyses were performed to characterize gene pol polymorphism in additional 178 subtype A HIV-1 isolates. Among total 319 samples studied, Mutv77IA62V variant accounted for 56%, and was found to predominate in Russia in terms of both its geographical distribution and number of cases caused. Moreover, these viruses were prevalent in the regions known to have highest incidence of HIV-1 infection (Irkutsk, Samara, and Moscow regions). In addition, three other variants were found: viruses not containing the substitutions V77I or A62V, and variants bearing only one of them. Evolutional relationships between all four HIV-1 variants, as well as potential impact of the gene pol polymorphism on HIV-1 replicative fitness and drug resistance development are discussed.",M2
16277626,"Drinking in the Commonwealth of Independent States--evidence from eight countries.AIMS: To describe the frequency of alcohol consumption and beverage preferences in eight countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (<e>CIS</e>). DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Populations of Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation and Ukraine. PARTICIPANTS: Representative samples of the adult population of each country (overall sample size 18,428; response rates: 71-88%). MEASUREMENTS: A standardised questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers to examine alcohol consumption frequency and usual intakes of beer, wine and strong spirits. FINDINGS: Between 11 and 34% of males and 26-71% of females reported never drinking alcohol. Abstention was lowest in the Russian Federation and Belarus, two traditional spirits-drinking countries. It was particularly high in Kyrgyzstan and Georgia, two countries with a relatively low frequency of alcohol consumption but large amounts consumed per occasion (particularly Georgia). On the contrary, Moldovan respondents drank frequently, but consumed smaller amounts per occasion. As expected, spirits were consumed in largest amounts in traditional spirits-drinking countries, as well as Armenia and wine in traditional wine-drinking countries. Beer consumption was relatively high in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (males), particularly in young respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Although cross-country comparisons of alcohol intake should be interpreted cautiously, this study suggested that drinking patterns in the countries examined are not entirely typical of usual dry/wet drinking cultures, and confirms that the CIS is very diverse in terms of drinking patterns and beverage preferences. The study provides an important baseline for future comparisons as markets open to new products, as has been the case elsewhere in Europe.",M2

There are worrying indications that official infant mortality counts, based on administrative data, may understate the true gravity of the problem in 15 countries in the region, including 11 out of 12 CIS countries, and 4 countries in South Eastern Europe. In the case of eight CIS countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia plus Romania, the evidence is strongest, not least because surveys that allow independent estimation of infant mortality have been carried out there. In the case of the remaining six countries, the evidence is more circumstantial, and based on inconsistencies within the official data themselves, combined with information on how live births are defined. However, we find also that surveys are rather blunt instruments, and that the confidence intervals that surround estimates from these surveys are often large.",M2

In the 1930s the concept of repeated hypoxic training was developed and the following induction methods were utilized: repeated stays at high-mountain camps for several weeks, regular high altitude flights by plane, training in altitude chambers, and training by inhalation of low-oxygen-gas mixtures. To the present day, intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) has been used extensively for altitude preacclimatization; for the treatment of a variety of clinical disorders, including chronic lung diseases, bronchial asthma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, emotional disorders, and radiation toxicity, in prophylaxis of certain occupational diseases; and in sports. The basic mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of IHT are mainly in three areas: regulation of respiration, free-radical production, and mitochondrial respiration. It was found that IHT induces increased ventilatory sensitivity to hypoxia, as well as other hypoxia-related physiological changes, such as increased hematopoiesis, alveolar ventilation and lung diffusion capacity, and alterations in the autonomic nervous system. Due to IHT, antioxidant defense mechanisms are stimulated, cellular membranes become more stable, Ca(2+) elimination from the cytoplasm is increased, and O(2) transport in tissues is improved. IHT induces changes within mitochondria, involving NAD-dependent metabolism, that increase the efficiency of oxygen utilization in ATP production. These effects are mediated partly by NO-dependent reactions. The marked individual variability both in animals and humans in the response to, and tolerance of, hypoxia is described. Studies from the Soviet Union and the CIS significantly contributed to the understanding of intermittent hypoxia and its possible beneficial effects and should stimulate further research in this direction in other countries.",M2

10350512,"Occupational cancer in the European part of the Commonwealth of Independent States.Precise information on the number of workers currently exposed to carcinogens in the Commonwealth of Independent States (<e>CIS</e>) is lacking. However, the large number of workers employed in high-risk industries such as the chemical and metal industries suggests that the number of workers potentially exposed to carcinogens may be large. In the CIS, women account for almost 50% of the industrial work force. Although no precise data are available on the number of cancers caused by occupational exposures, indirect evidence suggests that the magnitude of the problem is comparable to that observed in Western Europe, representing some 20,000 cases per year. The large number of women employed in the past and at present in industries that create potential exposure to carcinogens is a special characteristic of the CIS. In recent years an increasing amount of high-quality research has been conducted on occupational cancer in the CIS; there is, however, room for further improvement.

The sample consisted of 708 immigrants who were interviewed between the years 1993-1995 with an average age of 47.5 (sd 11.8). This sample was reinterviewed approximately a year and three months later (n = 520). The sample included two exposure groups--high exposed and low exposed based on the estimated levels of ground cesium contamination from the IAEA maps and a comparison group matched by age, gender, and year of immigration. Those over the age of sixty-five were disadvantaged, compared to those aged fifty to sixty-four, and younger, when it came to the tasks of immigrant absorption; learning the language, working and acquiring an income, and establishing alternative social networks which could offer support in times of illness.

9485761,"Dental hygiene care in the Commonwealth of Independent States.PURPOSE: This study assessed the performance of dental hygiene services and the perception of preventive oral health care in the Commonwealth of Independent States (<e>CIS</e>), formerly known as the USSR. METHODS: In April 1996, questionnaires were distributed to a convenience sample of 200 dentists in four cities of the CIS: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev, and Odessa. All questions were designed for practicing dentists since the dental hygiene profession in the CIS is not presently recognized. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 93% (N = 186). The results indicated that oral hygiene care is provided by dentists on a selective, non-routine basis. The number of missing teeth in persons age 35 is 5 to 7. An oral prophylaxis in the CIS accounts for 3.1 percent of all dental visits and is performed to either remove deposits that create an obstacle to oral health care treatment or, less often, to improve the esthetic appearance of teeth. Approximately 75 percent of the dentists responding indicated they perform periodontal probing on patients with obvious periodontal problems. Fluoride supplements are provided by 82 percent of respondents, although three-fourths do not perform routine bitewing radiographs and occlusal sealants. The majority indicated a need for dental hygienists to be employed within the CIS oral health care system. CONCLUSION: The study indicates a critical need for developing dental hygiene in the CIS. It is recommended that preventive oral health care be provided by dental hygienists who have been formally educated in such a curriculum.",M2
9467081,"Bridging the gap in mental health approaches between east and west: the psychosocial consequences of radiation exposure.Mental health professionals in Western countries and the Confederation of Independent States ([<e>CIS</e>], the former Soviet Union) have been examining the social and psychological consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident on the people who lived or are living in the exposed areas. Based on reviews of the literature, papers from international conferences, and communication between researchers in various countries, different perspectives have emerged on classifying distress and disorders and designing treatment programs. The origins of these differences lie in philosophical, historical, and political developments in the West and the CIS. These different approaches often have made it difficult for mental health professionals from the CIS and the West to work together. The goal of this paper is 2-fold: to identify and recognize the main differences in these approaches and to propose specific solutions for bridging the gap. The basic approach of mental health professionals in the CIS is a physiological, nosological one--it focuses on the etiology of the illness. Although their main diagnostic tool is the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, it has undergone adaptations that reflect the Soviet medical and physiological attitude toward psychiatry. These changes have resulted in the abrogation and addition of disorder categories. For example, in the CIS edition of the ICD-9, there is no mention of post traumatic stress disorder as a distinct disorder. In contrast, in the West, the dominant approach is a symptomatic, phenomenologic one. Emphasis is placed on a dynamic understanding of the disorder and treatment is conducted by mental health professional (psychologists, social workers, psychiatrists). This contrasts with the approach used in the CIS, where psychological distress often is somaticized and treatment undertaken by physicians rather than mental health professionals. The authors of this paper call on researchers to come together and work jointly on the recognition and resolution of these differences. Then both groups will be able to offer concrete solutions and build tools that can benefit both sides. It is hoped that these new approaches will receive worldwide recognition and prove useful for other mental health professionals working with persons affected by the accident at Chernobyl.",M2

Differentiation of three big aggregations of populations was shown: urbanized contemporary communities with low I values; small endogamous populations, mostly of hunters and gatherers; small towns' populations and rural populations with balanced reproductive indices. Microevolutionary changes take place in the latter conglomerate even now, statistically subdividing it into two clusters. A proposition was made about the existence of  ecological optimum  for populations intermediate between advanced industrial communities and communities of hunters and gatherers, corresponding to the population size and the nature and rate of population reproduction.",M2

AH was estimated in connection with risk factors (RF) from the standpoint of uni- and multidimensional statistical analysis. It has been established that RF (age, cholesterol and triglycerides concentration, overweight and alcohol use) make more significant contribution into the prevalence of diastolic AH whereas the systolic AH prevalence is largely determined only by age and education. The data obtained are likely to form the basis for the design of a more integral system of prophylaxis of cardiovascular diseases.",M2
7809388,"Past and present contraceptive behavior of new Soviet immigrant women in Israel.This exploratory research investigated past and current use of contraceptives among a purposive sample of 117 new immigrant women from the Commonwealth of Independent States (former Soviet Union). The findings confirm the widespread use of induced abortion (IA) as a method of birth control before immigration. Fifty-eight percent of the sample had had at least one IA, and the average was 2.7 IA. The most commonly used types of contraception before immigration were the pill, safe days, withdrawal, and the IUD. Currently used types of contraception were the IUD, safe days, withdrawal, and condoms; however only 45% of the sample were currently using any type of contraception. Of particular interest were the relatively high reported use of the pill before immigration and low current use, and the former low level of condom use and its increase in popularity in Israel. Despite the availability of more effective methods of birth control, safe days and withdrawal remain commonly used. The high cost of the pill was mentioned as a deterrent to its current use. Despite the high prior level of IA, the majority of women in this sample (84%) preferred today to use other birth control methods, and would like the opportunity to receive professional advice. These findings support the need for educational efforts directed toward new immigrant women from <e>CIS</e>.In early 1992 in Israel, 117 recent Jewish immigrant women from Belarus, Russia, and the Ukraine completed a questionnaire designed to examine their past and current contraceptive behavior.  The mean number of months in Israel was 2.7 months.  The mean number of children among the 90 women with children was 1.74 (range 1-5).  58.1% of all 117 women had had at least one induced abortion.  The mean number of induced abortions per woman was 2.7 (range 1-12).  More than 40% of women who had had at least one induced abortion had at least 3 induced abortions.  104 women were or had been married, or had a steady partner.  The most frequently used family planning methods in the past were oral contraceptives (OCs) (33.7%), safe days (24%), withdrawal (15.3%), and IUD (15.3%).  Only 4% used condoms in the past.  Current family planning methods used included IUD (23%), safe days (23%), withdrawal (18.3%), and condoms (13.5%).  Only 2.9% currently used OCs.  The mean number of methods currently used was 1.8.  Reasons for not using contraception before immigration were: not safe (18%), reduced sexual pleasure (11%), not available (9%), no steady sexual partner (7%), and desire to conceive (5%).  After immigration, reasons for not using contraception were too expensive (11%) (especially OCs) and not safe (9%).  84% preferred to use contraception rather than undergo an induced abortion.  62% wanted professional advise on contraception.  These findings illustrate the need to provide new immigrant women from the Commonwealth of Independent States with accurate information about the health effects of various family planning methods.",M2

The results showed that the use of antibacterial chemotherapeutics was everywhere excessive and the physicians thus tried to guarantee the success. The calculations revealed that the cost of the antibacterial drugs (in the prices of 1991) used improperly amounted to 1.26 rubles per an adult patient and 1.68 rubles per a child patient with reference to 1 average case. The negative aspects of such a pharmacotherapy of acute intestinal infections were the improper use in some regions of infusion dehydrating and antihistamine agents and polypragmasia. A highly variable use of bacteriophages, bacterial biological preparations, enzymes, immunostimulants and other drugs in the treatment of analogous infections in various hospitals was revealed.",M2

A total of 81 HIV isolates were obtained. The isolates were identified by using immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassay, by determining the activity of reverse transcriptase, immunoblot, electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction. Of the 81 isolates 79 were HIV-1 and 2 HIV-2. The strains differed in their infectivity, the kinetics of virus antigen accumulation, and the spectrum of susceptible cell lines. The viruses isolated may be assigned as two groups: high and low infective. The biological properties of the national HIV isolates were shown to be similar to the prototype HIV strains isolated elsewhere.",M2

The examination of random representative samples of male populations established that risk factors, such as age, arterial hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, dyslipoproteinemia, and smoking (p &lt; 0.05), make a significant contribution to the spread of CHD, including acute CHD. Age, arterial hypertension, and body weight (p &lt; 0.01) also make a substantial contribution to the development of CHD. The risk factors play a greater role in the spread of CHD in Tallinn, Alma-Ata, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk than in Moscow and Ufa, but in the spread of acute CHD in Tallinn, Kaunas, Ufa, and Alma-Ata than in Moscow and St. Petersburg.",M2

The patients group was multinational, of them 19 were Caucasoids and 4 Mongoloids. It was shown that HLA B5 in Caucasoids occurred more frequently vs normal controls (73.7% and 15.5%, respectively). Under the correction of the antigens number up to 21, the differences continued to be statistically high. Characteristic for B5 antigen was a high relative risk and close association with the disease. In antigen group B5 + B35 the relative risk and association power grew still higher. The B5 positive group statistically more frequently had superficial thrombophlebitis and less frequently gastrointestinal involvement. It is concluded that class 1 HLA antigens, B5 in particular, are closely associated with BD in <e>CIS</e> countries.",M2
