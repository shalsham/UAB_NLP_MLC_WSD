20117671,"Hypoglycemia during acute illness in children with classic congenital <e>adrenal</e> hyperplasia.Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) describes a group of genetic, autosomal recessive conditions, where there is a block in cortisol biosynthesis. Approximately 95 percent of cases are due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is discussed in this article. Patients with the severe or classic form of CAH have epinephrine deficiency in addition to cortisol deficiency. Both epinephrine and cortisol are important counterregulatory hormones and help prevent hypoglycemia during physical stress. This is the first prospective study to evaluate the incidence of hypoglycemia during acute illness in children with classic CAH. Our objective was to examine blood glucose levels and symptoms of these children during the physical stressor of a typical acute illness managed at home. Twenty patients, ages 3 to 10 years with classic CAH participated. Parents were instructed regarding management of illnesses, home blood glucose monitoring and questionnaire completion. Over 29 months, 20 patients completed questionnaires and 6 patients performed home blood glucose monitoring. A blood glucose of &lt;60 mg/dL was documented in 3 out of 8 monitored acute illness episodes, and in 2 out of 6 of monitored children. The acute illness episodes with documented blood glucose &lt;60 mg/dL were not associated with vomiting. Our data suggest that children with classic CAH may experience lowering of blood glucose during illnesses, and patient education regarding the management of common childhood illness should include glucose supplementation.",M1
20065506,"Relation of adrenergic receptors, which have roles in gastroprotective and anti-inflammatory effect of <e>adrenal</e> gland hormones, with cyclooxygenase enzyme levels in rats.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COX-2 enzyme inhibition is responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs, COX-1 for their effects upon the gastrointestinal system (GIS), along with other side effects. We investigated the relationship between COX levels and those adrenergic receptors known to play a role in gastroprotection and anti-inflammatory activity. METHOD: The effects of adrenaline and prednisolone on gastric COX-1 and COX-2 levels in both intact and adrenalectomized rats treated with doxazosin, yohimbine, propranolol, and metoprolol were determined. RESULTS: We found that adrenaline increases COX-1 levels in the gastric tissue of both intact and adrenalectomized rats by stimulating alpha-2 receptors. Adrenaline decreases COX-2 levels by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Prednisolone inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 in the gastric tissue of intact rats. In adrenalectomized rats, prednisolone increases gastric COX-1 by stimulating alpha-2 receptors, and decreases COX-2 levels by stimulating beta-2 receptors. CONCLUSION: Prednisolone cannot bind to a adrenergic receptors in the presence of adrenaline (intact rats) but, in its absence (adrenalectomy), binds to alpha-2 receptors, and stimulates them more effectively than adrenaline, suggesting a direct relationship between alpha-2 adrenergic receptors and COX-1 levels, whereas beta-2 receptors are directly related to COX-2 levels.",M1
19928051,"[Stress-protective activity of the CH3CO-Lys-Lys-Arg-Arg-NH2 synthetic peptide (protektin)]The CH3CO-Lys-Lys-Arg-Arg-NH2 peptide (the author has named it protectin) was synthesized, and its activity was studied during different stress actions. Protectin was found to normalize the content of corticosterone and adrenalin in <e>adrenal</e> glands and blood after its intranasal administration to rats one day before a cold or heat shock, or hypobaric hypoxia at doses of 1-10 microg/animal and after its intravenous administration just after acute hemorrhage at doses of 0.5-2 microg/animal. The intranasal administration of protectin at doses of 1-10 microg/rat one day before the heat or cold shock was also shown to prevent a change in the content of free histamine and the activity of diamine oxidase in myocardium, which was induced by the dramatic change in the activity of the enzyme after the temperature actions.",M1
19844121,"Evaluation of adrenomedullary function in patients with congenital <e>adrenal</e> hyperplasia.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is characterized by adrenal insufficiency with or without salt wasting. It is also accompanied by adrenomedullary hypofunction. The aim of the present study was to investigate adrenomedullary function in patients with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase and 11beta-hydroxylase deficiencies and in age-matched normal subjects. METHODS: We measured plasma catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) and urine metanephrine in 44 patients with CAH, 32 due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (17 patients with the salt-wasting form and 15 patients with the simple virilizing form), and 12 due to 11beta-hydroxylase deficiency, and in 25 healthy controls. RESULTS: Plasma epinephrine and urine metanephrine levels were significantly higher in the controls than in patients with CAH (p = 0.02 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly lower in the controls than in patients with CAH (p &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, patients with the salt-wasting form had lower norepinephrine levels in comparison to the other subgroups of CAH. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that CAH patients have insufficient epinephrine secretion, these patients have the ability to increase compensatory norepinephrine. However, this increase is much lower in patients with the salt-wasting form. These findings need to be confirmed by other studies.",M1
19691814,"Epinephrine kinetics in septic shock--a means to understand variable catecholamine efficiency?It is well-established that the hemodynamic response to infusing catecholamines, the most frequently applied drugs for circulatory support during shock states, may vary markedly within and between individuals. In this context it is striking that only scarce data are available on the pharmacokinetics of catecholamines in critically ill patients. Furthermore, the existing literature comprises fairly equivocal observations. Abboud and colleagues now report that, in patients with septic shock, epinephrine kinetics are linear and its clearance directly depends on body weight and is inversely related to the severity of the disease. The authors conclude that the endogenous <e>adrenal</e> axis hormones do not assume any additional importance.",M1
19663191,"[Neurohumoral regulation of blood pressure in rheumatic patients]AIM: To study characteristics of neurohumoral regulation of blood pressure (BP) in patients with systemic diseases of the connective tissue and hemorrhagic vasculitis (HV). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial included 45 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 25 patients with scleroderma systematica (SS), 30 HV patients and 30 healthy controls. The following parameters were estimated: activity of plasmic renin, aldosteron concentration in plasma, catecholamines (noradrenaline and adrenalin), serum level of endotheline-1, number of desquamated endotheliocytes by J. Hladovec (1978) with use of Goryaev's camera. A BP 24-h profile was obtained by the standard method with the device Kardiotekhnika 4000 AD. Renal function was assessed by blood creatinine (Reberg's test). RESULTS: Contribution of different factors to pathogenesis of arterial hypertension (AH) in rheumatic conditions was different. SLE activity enhancement was associated with renal dysfunction and growth of plasmic renin leading to AH resultant from activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system (RAAS), sympathico-<e>adrenal</e> system (SAS) and suspended by endothelial dysfunction. AH in SS patients presented with SAS activation, endothelial dysfunction and moderate pathology of the kidneys. HV activation provoked renal and endothelial dysfunction, SAS activation leading to development of AH. CONCLUSION: In rheumatic diseases AH develops with activation of SAS, RAAS, endothelial and renal dysfunction.",M1
19615391,"Surplus dietary tryptophan inhibits stress hormone kinetics and induces insulin resistance in pigs.Recently we have shown that surplus dietary tryptophan (TRP) reduced the plasma concentrations of cortisol and noradrenaline in pigs. Stress hormones are known to affect insulin sensitivity and metabolism. We now investigated the long-term effects of surplus dietary TRP on 1) plasma and urinary stress hormone kinetics, 2) insulin sensitivity for glucose and amino acid clearance, and 3) whole body nitrogen balance. Pigs were fed for 3weeks a high (13.2%) vs normal (3.4%) TRP to large neutral amino acids (LNAA) diet, leading to reduced fasting (14 h) plasma cortisol (17.1+/-3.0 vs 28.9+/-4.3 ng/mL, p&lt;0.05) and noradrenaline (138+/-14 vs 225+/-21 pg/mL, p&lt;0.005) concentrations, lower daily urinary noradrenaline (313+/-32 vs 674+/-102 ng/kg day, p&lt;0.001) and adrenaline (124+/-13 vs 297+/-42 ng/kg day, p&lt;0.001) but higher dopamine (5.8+/-0.5 vs 1.5+/-0.2 microg/kg day, p&lt;0.001) excretions, respectively. Insulin sensitivities for both glucose and amino acid clearance, (as measured by the intraportal hyperinsulinaemic (1 mU/kg min) euglycaemic euaminoacidaemic clamp technique), were lower by 22% in pigs on the high vs normal TRP/LNAA diet (14.8+/-1.4 vs 18.9+/-0.9, p&lt;0.05 and 69.7+/-4.3 vs 89.7+/-6.8 mL/kg min, p&lt;0.05, respectively) without affecting urinary nitrogen excretion (35.5+/-1.0 vs 36.6+/-1.0% of dietary nitrogen intake, p=ns). In conclusion, long-term feeding of surplus dietary TRP inhibits both baseline adrenocortical and sympathetic nervous system activity, it induces insulin resistance for both glucose and amino acid clearance but it does not affect whole body protein catabolism. This indicates that the bioactive amino acid TRP contributes to homeostasis in neuroendocrinology and insulin action and that low baseline adrenocortical and sympatho-<e>adrenal</e> axis activity are associated with insulin resistance.",M1
19576859,"Sound stress-induced long-term enhancement of mechanical hyperalgesia in rats is maintained by sympathoadrenal catecholamines.Although stress plays an important role in chronic widespread pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. We have recently demonstrated, in a model of chronic widespread pain, that prolonged enhancement of immune mediator hyperalgesia, induced by unpredictable sound stress, requires a contribution of both the sympathoadrenal (epinephrine) and the hypothalamic-pituitary <e>adrenal</e> (corticosterone) neuroendocrine stress axes. Because this stress protocol produced sustained elevation of plasma epinephrine, in the current study we tested the hypothesis that the sympathoadrenal axis also plays a role in maintenance of symptoms in this model of chronic widespread pain. After establishment, adrenal medullectomy abolished the enhancement of epinephrine-induced cutaneous and muscle hyperalgesia. Administration of stress levels of epinephrine to adrenal medullectomized rats reconstituted the pain phenotype. These observations suggest that the sympathoadrenal stress axis plays a major role in the induction as well as maintenance of stress-induced enhancement of mechanical hyperalgesia, mediated by prolonged elevation of circulating epinephrine. PERSPECTIVE: We present data showing mechanical hyperalgesia persisting for up to 28 days after exposure to sound stress, with evidence that the sympathoadrenal axis mediator epinephrine plays a major role. These findings could have clinical implications with regard to novel potential treatments for chronic widespread pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia.",M1
19503019,"Glucocorticoid treatment--effect on <e>adrenal</e> medullary catecholamine production.Glucocorticoid and epinephrine are important stress hormones secreted from the adrenal gland during critical illness. Adrenal glucocorticoid stimulates phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) to convert norepinephrine to epinephrine in the adrenal medulla. Glucocorticoid is sometimes used in catecholamine-resistant septic shock in critically ill patients. By suppressing adrenal glucocorticoid production, glucocorticoid therapy might also reduce the secretion of epinephrine during stress. To investigate this, we used a mouse model subjected to glucocorticoid therapy under basal conditions (experiment 1) and during stress (experiment 2). In experiment 1, pellets containing 0% to 8% dexamethasone were implanted subcutaneously in mice for 4 weeks. In experiment 2, animals received 14 days of intraperitoneal injections of normal saline, low- or high-dose dexamethasone, followed by 2 h of restraint. We found that in experiment 1, adrenal corticosterone did not differ with dexamethasone treatment. Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase messenger RNA levels and adrenal catecholamines were highest in the 8% dexamethasone group. Compared with experiment 1, restrained control mice in experiment 2 had high adrenal corticosterone, which decreased with dexamethasone. Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase messenger RNA content doubled with restraint but decreased with dexamethasone treatment. As in experiment 1, adrenal catecholamine content increased significantly with dexamethasone treatment. We conclude that without stress, when adrenocorticotropic hormone is low, high doses of exogenous dexamethasone stimulate PNMT and catecholamine synthesis, likely independently of adrenal corticosterone concentration. After stress, adrenocorticotropic hormone levels are elevated, and exogenous dexamethasone suppresses endogenous corticosterone and PNMT production. Nonetheless, catecholamines increase, possibly due to direct neural stimulation, which may override the hormonal regulation of epinephrine synthesis during stress.",M1
19502771,"Relationship between stress hormones and immune response during high-altitude exposure in women.We previously confirmed that high altitude (HA) exposure can modify the number and function of immune cells, leading to a disruption in the homeostatic regulation of T helper1 (Th1)/T helper2 (Th2) immune responses. Our aim was to evaluate possible relationships between the stress response and immunological parameters during HA exposure. Thirteen healthy women spent 21 days at 5050 m. Before (SL1), the first and the 21st day at HA (HA1 and HA2, respectively), and the day after returning at sea level (SL2), we collected blood samples for immunologic parameters, and 24-h urine samples for norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol. Norepinephrine and cortisol significantly increased (p&lt;0.01) at HA1 and HA2 compared to SL1, while epinephrine did not change. At HA1, CD3+ T-cell fell significantly (p&lt;0.001) with respect to SL1, owing to a significant (p&lt;0.001) CD4+ T-cell reduction, while CD16+ and CD56+ increased (p&lt;0.001) at HA2 compared to SL1. The expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) decreased (p&lt;0.0005) at HA1 and HA2 with respect to SL1. At HA1 different lymphocyte subset (CD3+, CD4+, CD19+) were well correlated with epinephrine (p&lt;0.05), whereas in analyzing the combined data (SL1-HA1-HA2-SL2), CD3+ (r=-0.310), CD4+ (r=-0.332), CD16+ (r=0.404), and CD56+ (r=0.373) demonstrated moderate but significant correlations (p&lt;0.05) with norepinephrine. Moreover, norepinephrine levels were inversely correlated (r=-0.591; p&lt;0.001) with IFN-gamma expression, a typical Th1 cytokine. We suggest that the sympatho-<e>adrenal</e> axis may have a role on the immunologic adaptations observed during HA exposure, and specifically on the observed impairment of the Th1/Th2 immune balance.",M1
19454298,"Acute incremental exercise, performance of a central executive task, and sympathoadrenal system and hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> axis activity.The purposes of this study were to examine the effect of acute incremental exercise on the performance of a central executive task; the responses of the sympathoadrenal system (SAS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) during exercise, while simultaneously carrying out the central executive task; and the ability of Delta plasma concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and cortisol to predict Delta performance on the central executive task. Subjects undertook a flanker task at rest and during exercise at 50% and 80% maximum aerobic power (MAP). SAS and HPAA activity were measured pre- and post-treatment by plasma concentrations of catecholamines, and cortisol and ACTH, respectively. Reaction time (RT) and number of errors for congruent and incongruent trials on the flanker task showed significant main effects with performance at 80% MAP higher than in the other conditions. RT post-correct responses were significantly faster than RT post-error at rest and 50% MAP but not at 80%. Pre- and post-treatment catecholamines showed a main effect of exercise with a linear increase. Post-treatment ACTH concentrations at 80% MAP were significantly greater than in the other conditions. Delta epinephrine and ACTH combined were significant predictors of Delta RT and Delta norepinephrine was a significant predictor of Delta number of errors. It was concluded that exercise must be at a high intensity to affect performance on the flanker task. Both the SAS and HPAA appear to play a role in the exercise-cognition interaction.",M1
19387826,"Effects of short-term nocturnal cortisol replacement on cognitive function and quality of life in patients with primary or secondary <e>adrenal</e> insufficiency: a pilot study.Cortisol replacement in patients with adrenal insufficiency usually consists of hydrocortisone (HC) given orally during day time. Due to the short half-life of hydrocortisone, cortisol levels between midnight and early morning are very low in contrast to the physiological rise of cortisol serum levels during this time. We investigated whether short-term cortisol replacement during the night improves cognitive function and well-being in these patients. Fourteen patients with adrenal insufficiency were put on HC infusion between midnight and 8 a.m. They subsequently underwent neurocognitive testing to measure intellectual functioning, concentration, memory and fine motor skills. Quality of life and mood were also evaluated. All tests were repeated after 2-4 weeks during usual oral glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Blood samples were taken for cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine measurement. With the exception of the digit symbol test with better scoring in the oral group (p = 0.005) there were no significant differences in neurocognitive testing, vegetative functions and quality of life on the two occasions. However, a higher cortisol level was associated with a worse performance in short-term memory. Plasma epinephrine concentration was subnormal in both groups, but increased only after intravenous hydrocortisone replacement. Mimicking the physiological rise in cortisol secretion during the night in this pilot study did neither significantly affect quality of life nor cognitive performance and vegetative functions. There was no improvement in general well being. Hydrocortisone infusion during night time might improve adrenomedullary reserve in patients with adrenal insufficiency.",M1
19374850,"Brain cyclooxygenase and prostanoid TP receptors are involved in centrally administered epibatidine-induced secretion of noradrenaline and adrenaline from the <e>adrenal</e> medulla in rats.Plasma adrenaline mainly originates from adrenaline-containing cells in the adrenal medulla, whereas plasma noradrenaline reflects not only the release from sympathetic nerves but also the secretion from noradrenaline-containing cells in the adrenal medulla. The present study was undertaken to examine the mechanisms involved in centrally administered epibatidine (a potent agonist of nicotinic acethylcholine receptors)-induced elevation of plasma catecholamines with regard to the brain prostanoid. Intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered epibatidine (1, 5 and 10 nmol/animal) effectively elevated plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline. The epibatidine (5 nmol/animal, i.c.v.)-induced elevation of both catecholamines was attenuated by hexamethonium (an antagonist of nicotinic acethylcholine receptors) (0.9 and 1.8 micromol/animal, i.c.v.), indomethacin (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase) (0.6 and 1.2 micromol/animal, i.c.v.) and (+)-S-145 (an antagonist of prostanoid TP receptors) (0.6 and 1.3 micromol/animal, i.c.v.), and abolished by acute bilateral adrenalectomy. On the other hand, intravenously administered epibatidine (5 nmol/animal) was largely ineffective on the plasma levels of catecholamines, and intravenous pretreatment with hexamethonium (1.8 micromol/animal) had no effect on the epibatidine (5 nmol/animal, i.c.v.)-induced elevation of both catecholamines. These results suggest that centrally administered epibatidine activates the brain nicotinic acethylcholine receptors, thereby evoking the secretion of noradrenaline and adrenaline from the adrenal medulla by brain cyclooxygenase- and prostanoid TP receptor-mediated mechanisms in rats.",M1
19329107,"Circulating adrenaline released by sympathoadrenal activation elicits acute vasodilatation in the rat masseter muscle.The present study was designed to examine the effects of circulating catecholamines released by sympathoadrenal system on the haemodynamics of the masseter muscle in deeply urethane-anaesthetized, artificially ventilated, cervically vagotomized and sympathectomized rats. Intravenous administration of adrenaline induced a biphasic change of blood flow in the masseter muscle (MBF). The change of blood flow showed an initial marked increase and successive slight decrease in a dose-dependent manner (0.01-1 microg/kg). The administration of noradrenaline had no significant effect on the MBF. The increase in the MBF evoked by exogenously applied adrenaline was markedly reduced by the intravenous administration of propranolol (100 microg/kg), whereas pretreatment with either hexamethonium (10 mg/kg), atropine (100 microg/kg), or phentolamine (1 mg/kg) failed to affect the MBF increase. Electrical stimulation of splanchnic nerve (SPLN) preganglionic neurones projecting to the <e>adrenal</e> medulla elicited frequency-dependent (1-20 Hz) increases in the MBF. The intravenous administration of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor selective antagonist, ICI 118551 (0.5 mg/kg), almost abolished the MBF increase induced by SPLN stimulation, but pretreatment with the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor selective antagonist, atenolol (1 mg/kg), had no effect on this response. The results of the present study indicate that circulating adrenaline elicits acute vasodilatation through a beta-adrenergic mechanism in the rat masseter muscle. Vascular beta(2)-adrenergic receptors in the masseter muscle may be activated preferentially by adrenaline released from the adrenal medulla, suggesting that the sympathoadrenal system is involved in the marked MBF increase during sympathoexcitation.",M1
19303963,"Preoperative glucocorticoid administration attenuates the systemic stress response and hyperglycemia after surgical trauma in the rat.The stress response to surgery is characterized by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> axis and the sympathetic nervous system, and by an inflammatory response and hyperglycemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate if preoperative corticosterone could reduce the postoperative systemic stress response, without aggravating hyperglycemia or interfering with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, in a standardized rat model of surgical trauma. We used a standardized experimental model of intestinal resection in the rat. Exogenous corticosterone (8 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle was administered 2 hours before surgery; and postoperative plasma concentrations of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, adrenaline, noradrenaline, glucose, and insulin were determined. Exogenous corticosterone decreased preoperative plasma adrenaline but did not change plasma glucose or insulin levels. Moreover, corticosterone reduced postoperative plasma interleukin-6, catecholamines, and glucose (all P &lt; .001-.05) without any effect on the plasma corticosterone concentration compared with vehicle-treated controls. A preoperative 2-hour exposure of physiologic poststress corticosterone concentrations not only suppressed plasma IL-6 levels but also inhibited surgery-induced adrenaline release and suppressed plasma glucose levels. We hypothesize that glucocorticoids attenuated the inflammatory response in injured tissues that reduced afferent input into brain areas regulating the neuroendocrine response.",M1
19276635,"Maternal perinatal undernutrition alters postnatal development of chromaffin cells in the male rat <e>adrenal</e> medulla.Numerous data suggest that the development of the sympathoadrenal system is highly sensitive to the perinatal environment. We previously reported that maternal perinatal food restriction by 50% (FR50) altered chromaffin cell (CC) organization and activity in offspring at weaning. This study investigated the effects of FR50 on the postnatal time course of CC functional and structural adaptations. FR50 pups exhibited smaller and more abundant scattered clusters of noradrenergic CCs as early as postnatal day 7 (P7), indicating that morphological changes took place earlier during development. At birth, the adrenaline release was defective in FR50 pups, suggesting that maternal FR50 impaired the non-neurogenic control of catecholamine release. At P4, the catecholamine release in response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was also absent in FR50 pups. This was associated with the reduction of adrenal catecholamine contents, indicating that the failure to synthesize catecholamine might lead to impaired secretion. We hypothesized that maternal FR50 accelerated the functional connections between CCs and splanchnic nerve endings, leading to the premature loss of the non-neurogenic response. Acetylcholine-containing synaptic endings seemed more precociously functional in FR50 pups, as suggested by increased levels of acetylcholine esterase activity at P14. At P7, insulin-induced hypoglycaemia caused preferential adrenaline release associated with increased catecholamine contents in both groups. However, the response was accentuated in FR50 pups. At P14, the insulin challenge increased plasma levels of adrenaline in control rats, whereas it markedly enhanced the circulating level of both catecholamines in FR50 pups. We demonstrated that maternal FR50 leads to developmentally impaired noradrenergic CC aggregation and advanced splanchnic neurotransmission maturation associated with altered medulla activity in response to metabolic stress. This might contribute to the long-lasting malprogramming of the adrenal medulla and to the development of chronic adult diseases.",M1
19266184,"Behavioral sensitization to cocaine: cooperation between glucocorticoids and epinephrine.RATIONALE: Stressful life experiences facilitate responsiveness to psychostimulant drugs. While there is ample evidence that <e>adrenal</e> glucocorticoids mediate these effects of stress, the role of the sympatho-adrenal system in the effects of psychostimulants is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the role of the two adrenal stress hormones, corticosterone and epinephrine, in sensitization to the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The DBA/2 mouse strain was used, as behavioral sensitization in this strain critically depends on adrenal hormones. Animals were subjected to adrenalectomy ( ADX , surgical removal of the adrenals) or SHAM surgery, and ADX mice were given replacement of epinephrine (5 x 10(-3) mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.) just prior to each drug administration), corticosterone (20%, s.c., pellet), or both. Mice were subjected to a cocaine sensitization regimen (15.0 mg/kg cocaine on nine consecutive days followed by a 7.5 mg/kg cocaine challenge after a 5-day withdrawal). RESULTS: In agreement with our previous observations, ADX prevented initiation and expression of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Whereas neither corticosterone nor epinephrine alone were sufficient to reverse the ADX effect, both hormones were necessary to fully restore initiation and retention of sensitization to levels observed in SHAM animals. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate that corticosterone and epinephrine cooperate to facilitate behavioral responsiveness to cocaine. These data emphasize that in addition to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the sympathetic nervous system plays a critical role in psychostimulant sensitivity.",M1
19261400,"Cardiac failure due to epinephrine-secreting pheochromocytoma: clinical, laboratory and pathological findings in a sudden death.A rare case of cardiac failure due to hypertensive crisis in pheochromocytoma in a 25-year-old young man is presented. In the Emergency Department the patient complained of persisting headache and vomiting; he was distressed but fully alert, his heart rate was 110 b/min and blood pressure 180/80 mmHg. Few hours after admission, the clinical course suddenly got worse with signs and symptoms of fatal cardiac shock (dyspnoea, cyanosis, pulmonary oedema, hypocontractility of left ventricle). Autopsy revealed a large tumour of the left <e>adrenal</e> gland. Histological examination confirmed macroscopic suspicion of pheochromocytoma. Catecholamine serum levels were analysed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. The urine contained 35 microg/24 h norepinephrine and 184 microg/24 h epinephrine (normal range &lt; or = 64 and &lt; or = 36 microg/24 h respectively). These laboratory findings impressively demonstrate that the tumour was active, secreting high levels of epinephrine. Cardiac failure due to an acute catecholamine-related hypertensive crisis was established as the cause of death.",M1
19220706,"Hypoxic stress-induced changes in adrenergic function: role of HIF1 alpha.Sustaining epinephrine-elicited behavioral and physiological responses during stress requires replenishment of epinephrine stores. Egr-1 and Sp1 contribute by stimulating the gene encoding the epinephrine-synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), as shown for immobilization stress in rats in <e>adrenal</e> medulla and for hypoxic stress in adrenal medulla-derived PC12 cells. Hypoxia (5% O(2)) also activates hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1alpha, increasing mRNA, nuclear protein and nuclear protein/hypoxia response element binding complex formation. Hypoxia and HIF1alpha over-expression also elevate PNMT promoter-driven luciferase activity in PC12 cells. Hypoxia may be limiting as HIF1alpha over-expression increases luciferase expression to no greater extent than oxygen reduction alone. HIF1alpha inducers CoCl(2) or deferoxamine elevate luciferase as well. PC12 cells harboring a HIF1alpha expression construct show markedly higher levels of Egr-1 and Sp1 mRNA and nuclear protein and PNMT mRNA and cytoplasmic protein. Inactivation of Egr-1 and Sp1 binding sites in the proximal -893 bp of PNMT promoter precludes HIF1alpha stimulation while a potential hypoxia response element (-282 bp) in the promoter shows weak HIF1alpha affinity at best. These findings are the first to suggest that hypoxia activates the proximal rat PNMT promoter primarily via HIF1alpha induction of Egr-1 and Sp1 rather than by co-activation by Egr-1, Sp1 and HIF1alpha. In addition, the rise in HIF1alpha protein leading to Egr-1 and Sp1 stimulation of PNMT appears to include HIF1alpha gene activation rather than simply prevention of HIF1alpha proteolytic degradation.",M1
19219294,"The inhibitory role of sympathetic nervous system in the Ca2+-dependent proteolysis of skeletal muscle.Mammalian cells contain several proteolytic systems to carry out the degradative processes and complex regulatory mechanisms to prevent excessive protein breakdown. Among these systems, the Ca2+-activated proteolytic system involves the cysteine proteases denoted calpains, and their inhibitor, calpastatin. Despite the rapid progress in molecular research on calpains and calpastatin, the physiological role and regulatory mechanisms of these proteins remain obscure. Interest in the adrenergic effect on Ca2+-dependent proteolysis has been stimulated by the finding that the administration of beta2-agonists induces muscle hypertrophy and prevents the loss of muscle mass in a variety of pathologic conditions in which calpains are activated. This review summarizes evidence indicating that the sympathetic nervous system produces anabolic, protein-sparing effects on skeletal muscle protein metabolism. Studies are reviewed, which indicate that epinephrine secreted by the <e>adrenal</e> medulla and norepinephrine released from adrenergic terminals have inhibitory effects on Ca2+-dependent protein degradation, mainly in oxidative muscles, by increasing calpastatin levels. Evidence is also presented that this antiproteolytic effect, which occurs under both basal conditions and in stress situations, seems to be mediated by beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptors and cAMP-dependent pathways. The understanding of the precise mechanisms by which catecholamines promote muscle anabolic effects may have therapeutic value for the treatment of muscle-wasting conditions and may enhance muscle growth in farm species for economic and nutritional purposes.",M1
19212441,"Upregulation of phagocyte-derived catecholamines augments the acute inflammatory response.Following our recent report that phagocytic cells (neutrophils, PMNs, and macrophages) are newly discovered sources of catecholamines, we now show that both epinephrine and norepinephrine directly activate NFkappaB in macrophages, causing enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6). Both <e>adrenal</e>-intact (AD+) and adrenalectomized (ADX) rodents were used, because ADX animals had greatly enhanced catecholamine release from phagocytes, facilitating our efforts to understand the role of catecholamines released from phagocytes. Phagocytes isolated from adrenalectomized rats displayed enhanced expression of tyrosine-hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, two key enzymes for catecholamine production and exhibited higher baseline secretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine. The effects of upregulation of phagocyte-derived catecholamines were investigated in two models of acute lung injury (ALI). Increased levels of phagocyte-derived catecholamines were associated with intensification of the acute inflammatory response, as assessed by increased plasma leak of albumin, enhanced myeloperoxidase content in lungs, augmented levels of proinflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and elevated expression of pulmonary ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. In adrenalectomized rats, development of ALI was enhanced and related to alpha(2)-adrenoceptors engagement but not to involvement of mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid receptors. Collectively, these data demonstrate that catecholamines are potent inflammatory activators of macrophages, upregulating NFkappaB and further downstream cytokine production of these cells. In adrenalectomized animals, which have been used to further assess the role of catecholamines, there appears to be a compensatory increase in catecholamine generating enzymes and catecholamines in macrophages, resulting in amplification of the acute inflammatory response via engagement of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors.",M1
19201422,"An experimental model of intestinal resection and compensated non-hypotensive blood loss.BACKGROUND: Massive hemorrhage results in hypovolemia and hypotension that activate the sympathetic-<e>adrenal</e>-system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and induce metabolic changes such as hyperglycemia. Blood loss during surgery, however, is rapidly compensated by intravenous fluids to minimize negative impact on circulation. The aim of this study was to develop an experimental model for studies of the stress response and metabolic alterations seen after major abdominal surgery by combining intestinal resection with compensated non-hypotensive blood loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Intestinal resection in the rat was combined blood loss (7% and 16% of total blood volume) with subsequent fluid replacement (2 x volume of saline + hydroxyethyl starch, 50:50) to investigate the effects on blood pressure, plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline (0-2 h postoperatively), glucose, insulin, corticosterone, and hematocrit (0-24 h postoperatively). RESULTS: Surgical trauma alone or in combination with blood loss and fluid replacement did not decrease mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) compared with anesthetized controls. Plasma levels of catecholamines were unchanged during the period of blood loss. After surgery and blood loss, plasma glucose showed a blood loss volume-dependent increase up to 12 h postoperatively compared to surgery alone (P &lt; 0.001-0.05). Plasma corticosterone increased after surgery alone and in combination with blood loss but the changes were not dependent on the magnitude of blood loss. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical trauma combined with compensated non-hypotensive blood loss induced persistent volume-dependent hyperglycemia that did not depend on changes in plasma corticosterone and, in the early postoperative phase, MAP and catecholamines. Our data indicate that blood loss per se, without causing hypotension or acute elevations in catecholamines, can induce marked postoperative hyperglycemia. The experimental model presented in this report will be a useful tool to further elucidate mechanisms underlying the changes in glucose metabolism seen after surgical injury.",M1
19120143,"Unexplained symptomatic paroxysmal hypertension in pseudopheochromocytoma: a stress response disorder?Among overall numbers of patients tested for pheochromocytoma, less than 2% harbor the tumor. Among the rest, there is often no satisfactory explanation for the signs and symptoms leading to suspicion of pheochromocytoma. This group includes patients with severe symptomatic paroxysmal hypertension, often referred to as pseudopheochromocytoma, a condition that can be debilitating for patients and perplexing for clinicians. Similar to patients with the real tumor, patients with pseudopheochromocytoma can be misdiagnosed with panic disorder. However, pseudopheochromocytoma is characterized by an absence of panic or emotional distress preceding the onset of hypertension and symptoms of catecholamine excess. Because the clinical manifestations of pseudopheochromocytoma are similar, if not identical, to those due to excess circulating catecholamines in patients with the tumor, the most attractive explanation for the disorder is that it involves altered function of the autonomic nervous system. In line with this hypothesis, recent findings suggest that enhanced <e>adrenal</e> release of epinephrine and exaggerated cardiovascular responsiveness to catecholamines both contribute to the paroxysmal hypertension and symptoms of catecholamine excess in pseudopheochromocytoma. From this pattern, one would predict that therapeutic interventions that inhibit adrenal secretion of epinephrine or block adrenoceptor-mediated responses to catecholamines might provide a logical approach to therapy.",M1
19120141,"Response of the adrenomedullary system to early postnatal stress in the Brattleboro rat.The sympathetic-adrenomedullary system and the pituitary-adrenocortical axis are linked to each other by chemical signals transferring information between both endocrine systems. Here we addressed the question of whether the neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) is involved in this type of information transfer during early postnatal development. The impact of congenital absence of AVP on the endocrine stress response was investigated using the AVP-deficient Brattleboro rat. Under resting conditions, we failed measure a significant difference in plasma norepinephrine levels between 10-day-old AVP-deficient homozygous juveniles versus heterozygous AVP-producing littermates. Interestingly, repeated ether exposure resulted in a reduction of plasma epinephrine levels in both genotypes. In the <e>adrenal</e>, we detected increased levels of the epinephrine-synthesizing enzyme phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) after ether inhalation in vasopressin-deficient pups only. These data provide insight into the development of the regulation of stress-related epinephrine secretion during ontogenesis. Furthermore, our results imply that the congenital absence of AVP affects the synthesis of PNMT in response to defined stressor exposure.",M1
19120131,"Adrenoceptors and adaptive mechanisms in the heart during stress.Several cardiovascular disorders have been related to alterations in beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) signaling at or beyond the receptor level. During the stress reaction, the sympathetic-<e>adrenal</e> medullary system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal cortex axis are activated, causing beta-AR overstimulation and remodeling of the beta(1)/beta(2)/beta(3)-AR ratio in cardiomyocytes. In a model of foot-shock stress, we described decreased beta(1)-AR signaling occurring simultaneously with increased beta(2)-AR signaling, whereas the response to the nonconventional agonist, CGP12177, was not altered. These alterations may play an adaptive role to the increased sympathetic drive to the heart, protecting the cardiac tissue from the cardiotoxic effects mediated by beta(1)-ARs overstimulation without altering cardiac output, since this would be sustained by the beta(2)-AR, which would also protect myocytes from apoptosis. Moreover, the selective enhancement of the beta(2)-AR population might help to diminish the risk of overstimulation since this adrenoceptor subtype couples to both, stimulatory G (Gs) and inhibitory G (Gi) proteins. On the other hand, in the model of neurogenic hypertension, the decrease in beta(1)-AR-mediated response is not followed by increase in the beta(2)-AR-mediated response. However, the response to CGP12177, which was desensitized 48 h after the surgery, was normalized 7 days after that, when beta(1)-AR were downregulated. Therefore, both experimental models provided evidence that the classical isoform of beta(1)-AR and the recently described low-affinity isoform of beta(1)-AR show independent behavior and provide the heart with adaptive mechanisms to increased sympathetic stimulation during stress.",M1
19120125,"Epinephrine regulation of hemodynamics in catecholamine knockouts and the pithed mouse.Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) catalyzes synthesis of epinephrine (E) and is present in the brain, heart, and <e>adrenal</e>. E is a neurotransmitter and important hormone; however, its role in regulating cardiovascular dynamics is still unclear. We generated an E-deficient mouse model by knocking out the PNMT gene. The PNMT KO mouse had normal resting blood pressure, while treadmill exercise caused hypertension, suggesting an impaired response to stress in the absence of the stress hormone E. As PNMT occurs at a lower concentration in many extra-adrenal tissues including the brain, we set up a pithed mouse model to study the peripheral effects of E on cardiovascular dynamics, using pithing to eliminate central and reflex effects. The pithed mouse requires different surgical techniques and stimulation voltages than rats, and showed voltage- and frequency-dependent blood pressure responses to electrical stimuli. Stimulation with the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine gave a marked systolic pressor response, while the beta2 agonist salbutamol lowered diastolic blood pressure. The pithed PNMT KO mouse had an exaggerated blood pressure response to salbutamol, suggesting beta2 receptor supersensitivity. A targeted KO of tyrosine hydroxylase in PNMT-producing cells produced a mouse deficient in catecholamines in the adrenal. These targeted KO mice displayed significantly smaller pressor responses than pithed control mice. We find that E release during stress prevents an excessive increase in blood pressure.",M1
19120117,"Adrenergic responses to stress: transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes.Stress effects on adrenergic responses in rats were examined in <e>adrenal</e> medulla, the primary source of circulating epinephrine (Epi). Irrespective of duration, immobilization (IMMO) increased adrenal corticosterone to the same extent. In contrast, Epi changed little, suggesting that Epi synthesis replenishes adrenal pools and sustains circulating levels for the heightened alertness and physiological changes required of the  flight or fight  response. IMMO also induced the Epi-synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). The rise in its mRNA and protein was preceded by increases in Egr-1 and Sp1 mRNA, protein, and protein-DNA binding complex formation. With repeated and prolonged stress, PNMT protein did not reflect the magnitude of change in mRNA. The latter suggests that post-transcriptional, in addition to transcriptional mechanisms, regulate PNMT responses to stress. To further reveal molecular mechanisms underlying stress-induced changes in adrenergic function, the effects of hypoxia on PNMT promoter-driven gene expression are being examined in adrenal medulla-derived PC12 cells. Hypoxia activates the PNMT promoter to increase PNMT promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene expression and endogenous PNMT in PC12 cells. Induction of both appear mediated via activation of multiple signaling pathways and downstream activation of hypoxia inducible factor and PNMT transcriptional activators, Egr-1 and Sp1. Hypoxia generates both partially and fully processed forms of PNMT mRNA. The former reportedly is translated into a truncated, nonfunctional protein, and the latter into enzymatically active PNMT. Together, findings suggest that stress increases PNMT gene transcriptional activity but post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms limit the biological end-point of functional PNMT enzyme and, thereby, Epi.",M1
18974603,"An electron microscopic study on nerve endings on adrenomedullary adrenaline cells in golden hamsters: position, size and changes due to pinealectomy.Effects of sham-pinealectomy and pinealectomy on preganglionic nerve endings on adrenomedullary adrenaline cells were investigated electron microscopically. Adult male golden hamsters from the normal, sham-pinealectomy and pinealectomy groups maintained under 24 h light-dark cycle and constant temperature were used at 28 days after surgery. From conventional electron microscopic specimens, montage photographs made of the adrenaline cell region at a magnification of x 11,000 were used for qualitative and quantitative electron microscopic analyses in 14 animals in each experimental group. The preganglionic nerve endings were localized mainly in the following three sites: the basal lamina part, the follicular lumen-junctional intercellular part, and the adrenaline cell-invaginated part. In the latter two parts, nerve endings and fibers had no envelope frequently, and in the former two parts, nerve endings sometimes showed the invagination complex. The frequency of nerve endings was highest in the follicular lumen-intercellular part, next highest in the basal lamina part and lowest in the A cell-invaginated part. The frequency of nerve endings in the basal lamina part was lower in the pinealectomy group than in the sham-pinealectomy group (P &lt; 0.021), and those in the other two parts showed opposite changes, more evidently in the A cell-invaginated part. Nerve ending profiles in the adrenaline cell-invaginated part--which displayed a more rounded shape--increased in size in the pinealectomy group (longer diameter: P &lt; 0.04; shorter diameter: P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, preganglionic nerve endings in the <e>adrenal</e> medulla of the golden hamster show differential morphological changes following PX depending on the intracellular part of A cells.",M1

Two types of secretory structures, synaptic vesicles and secretory granules are found within the presynaptic terminal.

Here, we report on the hormonal status of a young adult with fragile X syndrome, with a focus on catecholamine and cortisol changes during a submaximal treadmill test.

18684212,"Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> (HPA) axis in irritable bowel syndrome.Enhanced stress responsiveness has been implicated as a potential mechanism contributing to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and should be reflected in altered function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system. Both of these systems can modulate mucosal immune function. The aims of this study were: (i) to characterize the basal circadian rhythm of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and cortisol in IBS vs healthy controls; (ii) to compare stimulated ACTH, cortisol and noradrenaline responses to a pelvic visceral stressor (sigmoidoscopy) in IBS and controls; and (iii) to correlate neuroendocrine responses with colonic mucosal cytokine expression and symptoms in IBS. Two separate studies were conducted in women. In Study 1, basal cortisol levels were analysed in 41 IBS and 25 controls using 24-h collections of plasma ACTH and cortisol (q10 min sampling). In Study 2, 10 IBS patients with diarrhoea (IBS-D) and 10 controls underwent sigmoidoscopy with measurements of stimulated neuroendocrine responses and cytokine mRNA expression in colonic tissue. Basal ACTH levels were significantly blunted (P &lt; 0.05), while basal and stimulated plasma cortisol levels were higher in patients. Basal cortisol levels prior to an experimental visceral stressor positively correlated with anxiety symptoms (P &lt; 0.004), but not IBS symptoms. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with diarrhoea had significantly decreased mRNA expression of mucosal cytokines [interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6] in the sigmoid colon vs controls (P &lt; 0.05). Although dysregulations in stress-responsive systems such as the HPA axis and mucosal immune function are demonstrated in IBS, they do not appear to have a primary role in modulating IBS severity and abdominal pain.",M1

A synchronism in the functional activity of the mediator component of the sympathoadrenal system as well as of the androgenic and glucocorticoid functions of the adrenal cortex was observed with age and during pubertal development of children. At the same time, heterochronic maturation was observed in the sex groups: in girls at the age of 10 and 12 years and in boys at the age of 14-15 years. The changes of different direction and intensity in the excretion of the studied hormones and hormonal metabolites were observed in the sex and age groups. A sharp increase in the daily excretion of glucocorticoid metabolites accompanied by a considerable decrease in the age index of noradrenaline secretion was observed in 14- and 15-year-old boys from beginning to end of school year; in addition, an increase in the daily excretion of sex hormones was observed at the age of 15 years. In girls, these indices varied within the age range, which points to a more sophisticated neuroendocrine control of physiological functions in girls during puberty.",M1
18647601,"Centrally administered neuromedin U elevates plasma adrenaline by brain prostanoid TP receptor-mediated mechanisms in rats.Neuromedin U is a hypothalamic peptide involved in energy homeostasis and stress responses. The peptide, when administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), decreases food intake and body weight while increasing body temperature and heat production. We examined the effect of i.c.v. administered neuromedin U on plasma catecholamines with regard to the brain prostanoid using anesthetized rats. Neuromedin U (0.1, 0.5 and 1 nmol/animal, i.c.v.) effectively elevated plasma adrenaline (a maximal response was obtained at 0.5 nmol/animal), but had little effect on plasma noradrenaline. However, intravenously administered neuromedin U (0.5 nmol/animal) had no effect on plasma catecholamines. Neuromedin U (0.5 nmol/animal, i.c.v.)-induced elevation of plasma adrenaline was effectively reduced by intracerebroventricular pretreatments with indomethacin (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase) (0.6 and 1.2 micromol/animal), furegrelate (an inhibitor of thromboxane A2 synthase) (0.9 and 1.8 micromol/animal) and (+)-S-145 (a blocker of prostanoid TP receptors) (250 and 625 nmol/animal), respectively. The neuromedin U-induced adrenaline response was also abolished by acute bilateral adrenalectomy. These results suggest that centrally administered neuromedin U evokes the secretion of adrenaline from the <e>adrenal</e> medulla by brain prostanoid TP receptor-mediated mechanisms in rats.",M1
18641310,"Low- versus high-baseline epinephrine output shapes opposite innate cytokine profiles: presence of Lewis- and Fischer-like neurohormonal immune phenotypes in humans?Immunogenetic mechanisms operating within the immune system are known to influence cytokine profiles and disease susceptibility. Yet the role of the individual's neurohormonal background in these processes remains undefined. Hormonal imbalances are documented in immune-related diseases, but it is unclear whether this represents a secondary phenomenon or a primary  defect  related to specific neurohormonal immune phenotype(s). We report that in a large subpopulation of healthy humans the baseline epinephrine output (but not cortisol and sex steroid hormones) correlated inversely with proinflammatory and positively with anti-inflammatory cytokine production. Thus, low vs high epinephrine excretors had a 2- to 5-fold higher TNF-alpha and IL-12 production but 2-fold lower IL-10 production induced by LPS ex vivo. In alternative settings, we found low baseline levels and profoundly blunted stress-induced epinephrine responses but high TNF-alpha levels in Lewis vs Fischer inbred rats. Additionally, isoproterenol, a beta adrenoreceptor agonist suppressed LPS-induced TNF-alpha production, with more pronounced effect in Lewis than in Fischer rats. In human monocytes, epinephrine and the beta(2) adrenoreceptor agonist fenoterol potently inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-12, but stimulated IL-10 production. The order of potency for hormones able to inhibit IL-12 production ex vivo was: epinephrine &gt; norepinephrine &gt; or = 1,25-(OH)(2) vitamin D(3) &gt; hydrocortisone. This indicates that baseline epinephrine conditions cytokine responsiveness and through this mechanism intrinsic hypo- or hyperactive <e>adrenal</e> medullas in some individuals may shape opposite cytokine profiles. Since Lewis and Fischer rats have opposite susceptibility to experimental immunological diseases, this suggests that the parallel human phenotypes could be linked to differing responsiveness and susceptibility to infections and immune/inflammatory-related conditions.",M1
18588946,"Novel role of adrenergic neurons in the brain stem in mediating the hypothalamic-pituitary axis hyperactivity caused by prenatal alcohol exposure.Exposure to alcohol during embryonic development leads to changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> (HPA) axis such that adult offspring release more adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) than controls when exposed to stress. In the present work, we tested the hypothesis that changes in the activity of the catecholaminergic system modulate, at least in part, this upregulation of the HPA axis. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to alcohol 6 h daily during gestation days 7-18 using the vapor chamber model, which generated mean blood alcohol levels of 188.6+/-10 mg/dl. All experiments were performed on 2 to 3-month-old offspring. We first measured the ACTH response to i.c.v. injection of adrenergic receptor agonists. In rats exposed to footshocks, we then investigated the activity of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) as well as indexes of catecholamine ir, namely tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunopositive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), TH immunopositive neurons in the locus coeruleus, and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) immunopositive neurons in the brain stem. While adult females exposed to alcohol during fetal development (FAE) displayed the expected enhanced ACTH response to stress, there were no significant differences in response to adrenergic receptor agonists or in shock-induced CRF/TH ir and neuronal activity, as determined by c-fos colocalization. In contrast, FAE female offspring exposed to footshocks showed a significant increase in the activity of adrenergic neurons in the C1 region of the brain stem, a population of cells that project to the PVN. Collectively, these results suggest that while FAE-induced hyperactivity of the HPA axis is not accompanied by significant changes in PVN CRF or TH-ir neurons, it is characterized by an upregulation of C1 adrenergic neurons of the brain stem. This novel finding should lead to the functional characterization of this brain region in the FAE model.",M1

The aim of the present investigation was to study stressful life events and biological stress markers among former psychiatric inpatients, who were followed up 12 years after an index suicide attempt. At the time of the index suicide attempt, and before treatment, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were taken, and 24 h (h) urine (U) was collected. 3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycole (MHPG) in CSF and 24 h urinary samples of cortisol and noradrenaline/adrenaline (NA/A) were analysed. Data concerning stressful life events were collected retrospectively from all participants in the study through semi-structured interviews at follow-up. We found that patients who reported sexual abuse during childhood and adolescence had significantly higher levels of CSF-MHPG and U-NA/A, than those who had not. Low 24 h U-cortisol was associated with feelings of neglect during childhood and adolescence. In conclusion, this study has shown significant and discrepant biological stress-system findings in relation to some adverse life events.",M1
18541906,"Psychosocial influences on HIV-1 disease progression: neural, endocrine, and virologic mechanisms.This review surveys empirical research pertinent to the hypothesis that activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> (HPA) axis and/or the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) might mediate biobehavioral influences on HIV-1 pathogenesis and disease progression. Data are considered based on causal effects of neuroeffector molecules on HIV-1 replication, prospective relationships between neural/endocrine parameters and HIV-relevant biological or clinical markers, and correlational data consistent with in vivo neural/endocrine mediation in human or animal studies. Results show that HPA and SNS effector molecules can enhance HIV-1 replication in cellular models via effects on viral infectivity, viral gene expression, and the innate immune response to infection. Animal models and human clinical studies both provide evidence consistent with SNS regulation of viral replication, but data on HPA mediation are less clear. Regulation of leukocyte biology by neuroeffector molecules provides a plausible biological mechanism by which psychosocial factors might influence HIV-1 pathogenesis, even in the era of effective antiretroviral therapy. As such, neural and endocrine parameters might provide useful biomarkers for gauging the promise of behavioral interventions and suggest novel adjunctive strategies for controlling HIV-1 disease progression.",M1
18509033,"Stress induces a switch of intracellular signaling in sensory neurons in a model of generalized pain.Stress dramatically exacerbates pain in diseases such as fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that stress causes generalized hyperalgesia by enhancing pronociceptive effects of immune mediators. Rats exposed to nonhabituating sound stress exhibited no change in mechanical nociceptive threshold, but showed a marked increase in hyperalgesia evoked by local injections of prostaglandin E(2) or epinephrine. This enhancement, which developed more than a week after exposure to stress, required concerted action of glucocorticoids and catecholamines at receptors located in the periphery on sensory afferents. The altered response to pronociceptive mediators involved a switch in coupling of their receptors from predominantly stimulatory to inhibitory G-proteins (G(s) to G(i)), and for prostaglandin E(2), emergence of novel dependence on protein kinase C epsilon. Thus, an important mechanism in generalized pain syndromes may be stress-induced coactivation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> and sympathoadrenal axes, causing a long-lasting alteration in intracellular signaling pathways, enabling normally innocuous levels of immune mediators to produce chronic hyperalgesia.",M1
18503226,"Alcohol produces imbalance of <e>adrenal</e> and neuronal sympathetic activity in patients with alcohol-induced neurocardiogenic syncope.BACKGROUND: The mechanism of alcohol-induced syncope is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Head-up tilt tests (HUT: upright at 80 degrees for 30 min) were performed before and after alcohol consumption in 25 patients with unexplained syncope after drinking alcohol. Plasma levels of epinephrine (P-E) and norepinephrine (P-NE) were measured in a supine position and during HUT (at 15 min). Before drinking alcohol, HUT did not provoke neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) in any of the 25 patients. After drinking alcohol, HUT provoked NCS in 11 patients (alcohol-positive or AP group) but not in 14 patients (alcohol-negative or AN group). Prior to alcohol consumption, P-E and P-NE increased during HUT in both groups, and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. After alcohol consumption, P-E and P-NE increased during HUT in both group. During HUT, P-NE did not differ between the 2 groups, but P-E was significantly higher in the AP group than in the AN group during HUT (258.0+/-179.2 vs 70.9+/-35.1 pg/ml, p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that an imbalance in the increases of adrenomedullar sympathetic nerve activity (as expressed by the P-E level) and peripheral sympathetic nerve activity (as expressed by the P-NE level) both induced by alcohol, may play a crucial role in alcohol-induced NCS.",M1

18378864,"Pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> and sympathetic nervous system responses to stress in women remitted from recurrent major depression.OBJECTIVE: To better understand the changes in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) function after remission of depression. We characterized these systems at baseline and in response to a psychosocial stressor in a cohort of women remitted from recurrent major depression as well as in never-depressed healthy female controls. METHODS: Baseline HPA function was measured via saliva cortisol sampling at 8 AM and 4 PM over 7 days as well as quantification of urinary overnight cortisol secretion. The HPA system response to a psychosocial stressor was assessed by measuring serum cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels and SNS reactivity by determining serum epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations as well as autonomic nervous system changes by analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). The stressor included a speech task, mental arithmetic, and a cognitive challenge. RESULTS: In all, we studied 22 women remitted from recurrent major depression (age = 51.0 +/- 1.7 years) and 20 healthy controls (age = 54.2 +/- 1.6 years). Morning saliva cortisol concentrations were lower in remitted patients, paralleled by lower serum cortisol concentrations before stress testing. This group also displayed a blunted cortisol and ACTH response to the stressor, as compared with healthy controls. No between-group differences in HRV parameters were observed. CONCLUSION: In this group of women remitted from recurrent major depressive disorder, we found evidence of HPA system hypoactivity, both in the basal state and in response to a psychosocial stressor.",M1
18307392,"Hot and Cold natures and some parameters of neuroendocrine and immune systems in traditional Iranian medicine: a preliminary study.AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess differences in persons of a Hot or Cold nature (according to traditional Iranian medicine), in terms of changes in their neuroendocrine and immune systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven (37) male volunteers (20-40 years old) were divided into two groups, by whether they had a Hot or Cold nature. In addition, the Warmth/Coldness ratio of all the volunteers was assessed. Plasma concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol, and also the concentrations of interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-4 produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by mitogen were measured. RESULTS: The results showed that norepinephrine/epinephrine and norepinephrine/cortisol ratios were significantly higher, and that there was a borderline significantly increased IL-4/IFN-gamma ratio in the Hot nature group compared with those in the Cold nature group. In addition, there was a significant linear positive correlation between the norepinephrine/epinephrine and Warmth/Coldness ratios and a significant nonlinear association between the IL-4/IFN-gamma and Warmth/Coldness ratios. CONCLUSIONS: It can be deduced that the persons of a Hot nature had more sympathetic nervous system activity, less <e>adrenal</e> sympathetic, adrenal corticosteroid, and parasympathetic nervous system activities and more deviation of the immune system toward T-helper (Th)2 responses than the persons of a Cold nature. Moreover, the activity of the sympathetic nervous system was increased and adrenal sympathetic was decreased with an increasing Warmth/Coldness ratio. Furthermore, when the person's nature veered toward extreme Warmth or extreme Coldness, the deviation of the immune system toward Th2-like responses was greater, but this increased deviation was much more marked when veering toward extreme Warmth than toward extreme Coldness.",M1
18234185,"Bidirectional roles of the brain 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol in the centrally administered vasopressin-induced adrenomedullary outflow in rats.Previously, we reported that intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered arginine-vasopressin evokes the secretion of noradrenaline and adrenaline from <e>adrenal</e> medulla through the brain phospholipase C- and diacylglycerol-mediated and cyclooxygenase-mediated mechanisms in rats. Diacylglycerol can be hydrolyzed by diacylglycerol lipase to 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol, which may be further degradated by monoacylglycerol lipase to free arachidonic acid, a representative substrate of cyclooxygenase. Recently, 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol has been recognized as a major endocannabinoid, which can modulate synaptic transmission in the brain. In the present experiment, therefore, we examined (1) a role of the brain 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol as a precursor of arachidonic acid in the centrally administered vasopressin-induced elevation of plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline, and (2) a regulatory role of the brain 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol as an endocannabinoid on the vasopressin-induced response, using urethane-anesthetized rats. The vasopressin (0.2 nmol/animal, i.c.v.)-induced elevation of plasma catecholamines was reduced by RHC-80267 (diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor) (1.3 and 2.6 micromol/animal, i.c.v.) and also reduced by MAFP (monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor) (0.7 and 1.4 micromol/animal, i.c.v.). MAFP (1.4 micromol/animal, i.c.v.) also attenuated the 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (0.5 micromol/animal, i.c.v.)-induced elevation of plasma catecholamines. AM 251 (cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonist) (90 and 180 nmol/animal, i.c.v.) potentiated the vasopressin (0.2 nmol/animal, i.c.v.)-induced response, while AM 630 (cannabinoid CB(2) receptor antagonist) (198 and 793 nmol/animal, i.c.v.) was largely ineffective. In addition, WIN 55212-2 (cannabinoid CB receptor agonist) (188 and 470 nmol/animal, i.c.v.) dose-dependently reduced the vasopressin-induced response. These results suggest that the brain 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol generated from diacylglycerol plays a role as a precursor of arachidonic acid in the centrally administered vasopressin-induced activation of the adrenomedullary outflow, and also negatively regulates the peptide-induced central response through the brain cannabinoid CB(1) receptors in rats.",M1
18165573,"Real-time heart rate variability and its correlation with plasma catecholamines during laparoscopic <e>adrenal</e> pheochromocytoma surgery.BACKGROUND: We studied sympathovagal activity using real-time heart rate variability (HRV) and determined its relationship with plasma catecholamines to characterize short-term cardioregulatory mechanisms during laparoscopic adrenal pheochromocytoma surgery. METHODS: We recruited 20 patients with pheochromocytoma (Group P) and 20 with incidentaloma (Group I). HRV, systolic blood pressure and heart rate were continuously monitored. The low frequency and high frequency spectra denoted, respectively, sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. The low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio represented sympathovagal balance. Blood samples for epinephrine and norepinephrine assays were collected before, during, and after surgery. After log transformation of the repeated measures, a linear regression model was applied on their mean values. The correlation coefficients among variables were calculated using the Spearman rank test. RESULTS: No significant changes were observed in Group I. In Group P, epinephrine and norepinephrine increased in all patients during peritoneal insufflation and tumor resection. In 16 patients, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, low frequency, and LF/HF ratio increased concurrently. In four patients, low frequency and LF/HF ratio decreased. Three of these patients had normal systolic blood pressure and heart rate, and the fourth patient had hypotension and tachycardia. The high frequency component was enhanced in 15 patients and was stable in five. Low frequency was correlated with norepinephrine (r = 0.68, P &lt; 0.001), systolic blood pressure (r = 0.66, P &lt; 0.01), and heart rate (r = 0.62, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a strong correlation between low frequency HRV, plasma norepinephrine, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate during pheochromocytoma surgery.",M1
18093714,"Effects of nonylphenol on the calcium signal and catecholamine secretion coupled with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in bovine <e>adrenal</e> chromaffin cells.Nonylphenol (NP) is the most critical metabolite of alkylphenol polyethoxylate detergents. NP is known as an endocrine disruptor with estrogenic activities and as an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. Estrogen has modulatory roles on ligand-gated ion channels, such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitors can modulate the cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)]) and thus can affect the calcium signaling coupled with nAChRs. Therefore, NP is predicted to have complex effects on the Ca(2+) signaling and secretion coupled with nAChRs. This study investigated these effects using bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. The results show that NP suppressed the Ca(2+) signaling coupled with nAChRs and voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels in a dose-dependent manner, with IC(50)s of 1 and 5.9 microM, respectively. Estradiol exhibits similar suppression but much lower inhibitory potencies. NP alone induced a transient rise in [Ca(2+)](c) in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium. Thapsigargin, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, partially suppressed the [Ca(2+)](c) rise induced by NP, but NP totally blocked the [Ca(2+)](c) rise induced by thapsigargin. This illustrates that NP can cause Ca(2+) release from thapsigargin-insensitive pools. Thapsigargin suppressed the Ca(2+) signaling coupled with nAChRs but increased that coupled with voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels. We propose that three routes are responsible for the effects of NP on nAChRs: named receptor channels, voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, and Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release. Three routes are related to the characteristics of NP as steroid-like compounds and Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor.",M1
18093169,"Alcohol-induced stress in painful alcoholic neuropathy.Chronic alcohol consumption induces a painful small-fiber peripheral neuropathy, the severity of which increases during alcohol withdrawal. Chronic alcohol consumption also produces a sustained increase in stress hormones, epinephrine and corticosterone, that is exacerbated during alcohol withdrawal. We report that <e>adrenal</e> medullectomy and administration of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone (RU 38486), both prevented and reversed a model of painful peripheral neuropathy in alcohol binge-drinking rats. Chronic administration of stress levels of epinephrine to rats that had undergone adrenal medullectomy and were being fed the alcohol diet reconstituted this phenotype. Intrathecal administration of oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to the beta(2)-adrenergic- or glucocorticoid-receptor also prevented and reversed the pro-nociceptive effects of ethanol. Our results suggest a convergence of the effects of mediators of the hypothalamic-pituitary- and sympathoadrenal-stress axes on sensory neurons in the induction and maintenance of alcohol-induced painful peripheral neuropathy.",M1
18090541,"Adrenomedullary catecholamine, pressor and chronotropic responses to human coagulation beta-FXIIa mediated by endogenous kinins.OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence that blood coagulation factors can influence blood pressure. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the beta fragment of human coagulation factor XIIa (beta-FXIIa) induces <e>adrenal</e> catecholamine-mediated pressor and chronotropic responses via bradykinin generated from the plasma kallikrein-kinin system. METHODS AND RESULTS: In anaesthetized bioassay rats with blocked autonomic reflexes, in the Brown Norway strain a bolus injection of beta-FXIIa (1 microg/kg, administered intravenously) elicited a 170-fold rise in plasma epinephrine (from 0.12 +/- 0.02 to 20.58 +/- 2.42 nmol/l; P &lt; 0.001) and a fivefold increase in plasma norepinephrine (from 0.11 +/- 0.02 to 0.57 +/- 0.09 nmol/l; P &lt; 0.01), concurrent increases in systolic blood pressure (from 70 +/- 5 to 101 +/- 4 mmHg; P &lt; 0.01) and heart rate (from 315 +/- 11 to 408 +/- 15 bpm; P &lt; 0.01), and a doubling of bradykinin concentrations (P &lt; 0.05). Bilateral adrenal medullectomy abolished both the catecholamine and the haemodynamic responses to beta-FXIIa. Catecholamine, bradykinin and haemodynamic responses to beta-FXIIa were absent in plasma kininogen-deficient Brown Norway Katholiek (BNK) rats. Exogenous bradykinin dose-dependently reproduced these catecholamine and haemodynamic responses in Brown Norway and BNK rats, but not in Brown Norway adrenal medullectomized rats. CONCLUSION: The pressor and chronotropic responses to beta-FXIIa in this bioassay preparation are mediated exclusively through adrenal catecholamine release, and require plasma kininogens for their full expression. These observations suggest that interaction between the coagulation, kallikrein-kinin and sympatho-adrenal systems can exert important pressor effects in the absence of counterregulatory autonomic reflexes.",M1
18074473,"Overture for growth hormone: requiem for interleukin-6?BACKGROUND: Music has been used for therapeutic purposes since the beginning of cultural history. However, despite numerous descriptions of beneficial effects, the precise mechanisms by which music may improve human well-being remain unclear. METHODS: We conducted a randomized study in ten critically ill patients to identify mechanisms of music-induced relaxation using a special selection of slow movements of Mozart's piano sonatas. These sonatas were analyzed for compositional elements of relaxation. We measured circulatory variables, brain electrical activity, serum levels of stress hormones and cytokines, requirements for sedative drugs, and level of sedation before and at the end of a 1-hr therapeutic session. RESULTS: Compared with controls, we found that music application significantly reduced the amount of sedative drugs needed to achieve a comparable degree of sedation. Simultaneously, among those receiving the music intervention, plasma concentrations of growth hormone increased, whereas those of interleukin-6 and epinephrine decreased. The reduction in systemic stress hormone levels was associated with a significantly lower blood pressure and heart rate. CONCLUSION: Based on the effects of slow movements of Mozart's piano sonatas, we propose a neurohumoral pathway by which music might exert its sedative action. This model includes an interaction of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis with the <e>adrenal</e> medulla via mediators of the unspecific immune system",M1
18053645,"Epinephrine inhibits analgesic tolerance to intrathecal administrated morphine and increases the expression of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha.Activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> (HPA) axis inhibits development of morphine tolerance. Also, the expression of CaMKIIalpha is increased following chronic administration of morphine. In the current study, we tried to examine the effect of epinephrine, on the development of morphine tolerance; and also evaluate the expression of CaMKIIalpha as a molecular index for tolerance development. Analgesic tolerance was induced by intrathecal (i.t.) injection of morphine 15 microg/rat, twice a day for 5 days. To study the effect of epinephrine on development or reversal of morphine tolerance, epinephrine was administrated 20 min before morphine injections. Analgesia was assessed using tail flick test. Gene expression assays were done using RT-PCR. Following 5 days of combined administration of morphine and epinephrine (2, 5 or 10 microg/rat), in day 6, morphine produced potent analgesia. Administration of saline and morphine during days 1-5, caused reduced analgesic effect of morphine on day 6. After tolerance induction during 5 days, co-administration of epinephrine and morphine for another 5 days, significantly reversed the tolerance. Both morphine and epinephrine increased the expression of CaMKIIalpha. The expression of CaMKIIalpha was highly increased following combined administration of epinephrine and morphine. Our results showed the inhibition and reversal of analgesic tolerance to local administrated morphine by epinephrine. We observed the increased expression of CaMKIIalpha without development of morphine tolerance in animals treated with combined epinephrine and morphine.",M1
18033206,"[Molecular basis of stress-evoked psychiatric disturbances]Stress, defined as coping with environmental challenges, involves the activation of the neuronal and neurohormonal systems. Central monoaminergic (noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic) neural networks, limbic structures, the sympathoadrenal system, the hypothalamo-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> axis, and the immune system are considered the most important stress pathways. Their activation determines stress reactivity and pathological consequences on exposure to situations of distress. Both trauma and long-term stress can cause alterations in the activities of neuroanatomical structures and neural networks within the central nervous system. These neurohormonal changes are associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a disturbance thought to be one of the most serious psychiatric illnesses. PTSD may develop in individuals after exposure to a traumatic event (war, violence, accident) and is manifested by various symptoms, such as re-experiencing, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, impaired memory of the event, sleep disorders, nightmares, panic attacks, and depression. In this review the neurohormonal changes associated with experiencing stress are presented to highlight the molecular and hormonal basis of PTSD.",M1
18021325,"Cytoplasmic organelles determine complexity and specificity of calcium signalling in <e>adrenal</e> chromaffin cells.Complex and coordinated fluctuations of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) regulate secretion of adrenaline from chromaffin cells. The physiologically relevant intracellular Ca2+ signals occur either as localized microdomains of high Ca2+ concentrations or as propagating Ca2+ waves, which give rise to global Ca2+ elevations. Intracellular organelles, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and nuclear envelope, are endowed with powerful Ca2+ transport systems. Calcium uptake and Ca2+ release from these organelles determine the spatial and temporal parameters of Ca2+ signalling events. Furthermore, the ER and mitochondria form close relations with the sites of plasmalemmal Ca2+ entry, creating 'Ca2+ signalling triads' which act as elementary operational units, which regulate exocytosis. Ca2+ ions accumulating in the ER and mitochondria integrate exocytotic activity with energy production and protein synthesis.",M1
18004127,"Effect of single-dose sertraline on the hypothalamus-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> system, autonomic nervous system, and platelet function.OBJECTIVE: Pharmacological treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is thought to decrease coronary risk in patients with depressive disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor intake may (1) attenuate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system, (2) improve disturbances of the autonomous nervous system, and (3) dampen the aggregability of platelets. There is only limited information about the influence of acute treatment with SSRIs on these systems, which is especially important for the initiation of therapy in high-risk cardiac patients. We compared the reaction of these systems to physical stress with single-dose SSRI treatment (100 mg) with that of placebo treatment. METHODS: Using a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled design, we assessed HPA system activity via serum cortisol and corticotropin as well as sympathetic nervous system by determining serum norepinephrine and epinephrine levels at baseline and as a response to stress. Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) provided information on sympathetic/parasympathetic balance. Platelet activity was measured via flow-cytometric determination of platelet surface activation markers along with the serotonin (5-HT) uptake of platelets. RESULTS: We studied 12 healthy young men under placebo and verum conditions. We found higher HPA system activity at baseline and after physical activity under sertraline when compared with placebo, no difference in sympathetic nervous system activity after physical exertion and only slightly heightened baseline epinephrine values after sertraline intake. No difference was seen between sertraline and placebo intake regarding platelet activity and 5-HT uptake, HRV, blood pressure, and HR. CONCLUSIONS: Initiating sertraline treatment increases HPA system activity and epinephrine concentrations. We found no clinically relevant effect of single-dose sertraline treatment on autonomous nervous function, platelet activity, or platelet 5-HT uptake. These findings may not be extrapolated to patients with affective or cardiac disorders or to other SSRIs.",M1
18000306,"Neuroendocrine profiling in inherited stress-induced arterial hypertension rat strain with stress-sensitive arterial hypertension.The functions of the hypothalamic <e>adrenal</e> cortical and sympathetic adrenal medullary systems were studied in rats with inherited stress-induced arterial hypertension (ISIAH strain). A characteristic feature of the ISIAH strain is an increase in arterial blood pressure measured both under basal conditions and after restraint stress in particular. In the control ISIAH rats, the basal plasma ACTH concentration was slightly lower than that in the normotensive Wistar albino Glaxo (WAG) rats, and no differences were found in plasma corticosterone. However, the 0.5-h restraint stress produced higher activation of the adrenal cortex in the ISIAH rats. Gluco- and mineralocorticoid responses to the blood volume reduction stresses and ACTH and corticosterone responses to social stress were stronger in the ISIAH than in the control WAG rats. An increase in epinephrine content in adrenals in the basal state and enhanced response of the sympathetic adrenal medullary system to handling stress were observed in the ISIAH rats. Restraint stress produced significantly higher expression of genes encoding corticotropin-releasing hormone-mRNA in hypothalamus and proopiomelanocortin-mRNA in pituitary in the ISIAH than in the WAG rats. Restraint stress produced a decrease in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression (GR-mRNA) in hippocampus in the ISIAH, but not in the WAG rats. A persistent increase in tyrosine hydroxylase-mRNA in adrenals of the ISIAH rats was found. It is concluded that the ISIAH rat strain is an appropriate model of stress-sensitive hypertension with the predominant involvement of the hypothalamic adrenal cortical and sympathetic adrenal medullary systems in its pathogenesis.",M1
17993249,"Progressive dysregulation of autonomic and HPA axis functions in HIV-1 clade C infection in South India.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection causes a wide spectrum of abnormalities in neurological, neuropsychological, and neuroendocrinological functions. Several studies report disturbance in autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hypothalamic pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> (HPA) axis function in HIV-1B infected individuals. However, no such investigations on the effect of HIV-1 clade C infection, particularly during the initial phase of the disease progression, have been reported. The present investigations were carried out longitudinally over a 2-year period at 12 monthly intervals in clinically asymptomatic HIV-1 clade C seropositive patients (n=120) and seronegative control subjects (n=29). We determined both the basal levels and the dynamic changes in plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT). Studies were also extended longitudinally (at three separate yearly visits of each participant), to evaluate the response of autonomic and HPA axis to mirror star tracing challenge test (MSTCT) and the values were determined as area under the curve (AUC, corrected for baseline levels of NE, E, ACTH, and CORT). The findings show that the values of basal plasma NE levels, as well as NE response to MSTCT (AUC) at the first visit of HIV-1 seropositive individuals did not differ from those found in the control subjects (NE, pg/ml, HIV-1C=313.5+/-12.7 vs. controls=353.0+/-21.3; p=NS; AUC, HIV-1C=225+/-14.75 vs. controls=232.7+/-19.34; p=NS, respectively). At the subsequent two visits of HIV-1 positive patients however, NE response to MSTCT challenge was progressively attenuated (AUC=235+/-19.5 and 162.7+/-13.6; p&lt;0.01 and 0.05, respectively) compared to that found at the first visit. On the other hand, plasma levels of E as well as E response to MSTCT at the first visit were significantly lower in HIV-1C seropositive individuals compared to those in the control subjects (pg/ml, HIV-1C=77.30+/-5.7 vs. controls=119.1+10.5; p&lt;0.05; AUC, HIV-1C =83.29+/-7.5 vs. controls=172.3+/-18.9; p&lt;0.001), but no further change was observed in AUC of E in response to MSTCT at the two subsequent yearly visits. The basal plasma levels of ACTH in HIV-1C seropositives were not different than in the control subjects (pg/ml: HIV-1C=20.0+/-0.9 vs. controls=23.1+/-1.6; p=NS), but ACTH response to MSTCT in HIV-1C seropositive patients at the first visit was lower than in the controls (AUC, HIV-1C=23.57+/-1.5 vs. controls=30.94+/-3.5; p&lt;0.05), and fluctuated between high and low at the second and third visits (AUC, 28.89+/-2.3 and 21.69+/-2.36, respectively). However, the baseline plasma levels of cortisol as well as the response of cortisol to MSTCT (AUC) in HIV-1C seropositive individuals were higher than in the control subjects at the first visit (mug/dl, HIV-1C=9.83+/-0.39 vs. controls=6.3+/-0.56; p&lt;0.05; AUC, HIV-1C=12.31+/-0.7 vs. control=9.18+/-0.9; p&lt;0.05), and remained high at the two subsequent yearly follow up visits of HIV-1C (AUC, 11.8+/-0.86 and 11.98+/-0.77, respectively). These findings demonstrate attenuated autonomic functions, a disconnection between response of ACTH and cortisol to the MSTCT challenge, and an inverse relationship between plasma levels of catecholamine(s) and cortisol. Since plasma catecholamines and cortisol are the peripheral mediators of the autonomic and HPA axis function, the findings of this study reflect the overall adverse effect of HIV-1C infection on autonomic as well as HPA axis functions. The findings, apart from being the first to demonstrate the progressive dysregulation of autonomic nervous system and HPA axis function among HIV-1C infected seropositive individuals much ahead of the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), also suggest that MSTCT, involving visuoconstructive cognitive abilities, is an effective stressor for unraveling the underlying dysfunctions in the neuroendocrine functions in health and disease.",M1
17977474,"Fish oil attenuates adrenergic overactivity without altering glucose metabolism during an oral glucose load in haemodialysis patients.Haemodialysis patients display an increased cardiac mortality, which may be partly related to increased sympathoadrenal activity and insulin resistance. Fish oil decreases <e>adrenal</e> activation induced by mental stress and has an insulin sensitizing effect in healthy subjects. Whole-body glucose metabolism after oral glucose was studied in eight haemodialysis patients before and after a 3-week oral fish oil supplementation (i.e. EPA + DHA at 1.8 g/d). Plasma glucose fluxes were traced by using [6,6- (2)H2]glucose infusion. Substrate oxidation was determined by using indirect calorimetry. Each patient was studied in the basal state and over the 6 h following absorption of a 1 g/kg glucose load. Energy expenditure in response to glucose re-increased over the last 2 h of the experiment (P &lt; 0.05), which coincided with an increase in plasma catecholamines, especially epinephrine (P &lt; 0.05), strongly suggesting a sympathoadrenal overactivity. Fish oil supplementation blunted both re-increase in thermogenic response and concomitant increase in plasma epinephrine, but not in plasma norepinephrine, over the last 2 h of the experiment. Fish oil did not alter either whole-body glucose metabolism or substrate oxidation. These data show that in haemodialysis patients, fish oil attenuates adrenal overactivity induced by oral glucose but does not modulate whole-body glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.",M1
17969877,"[Participation of annexins in Ca2+-regulated secretion of catecholamines]Secretion of catecholamines by <e>adrenal</e> medulla chromaffin cells occurs after their stimulation by nicotine or depolarization of plasma membrane. Adrenal medulla secrets mostly noradrenaline and adrenaline, both having pleyotropic action in the organism. Central role in regulation of exocytosis of catecholamines play calcium ions. Their intracellular concentration increases as a cell response to stimulus and creates signal to start secretion. Moreover, annexins are known to participate in regulation of biological membrane dynamics during intracellular transport processes, however their participation in secretion is less established then in endocytosis. Among twelve annexin subfamilies (AnxA1-A11 i A13) expressed in mammalian organisms only involvement of AnxA2 and AnxA6 in endocytosis is well documented. Some data suggests that annexins may play important functions also in Ca2+-regulated catecholamine secretion.",M1
17940215,"Antecedent short-term central nervous system administration of estrogen and progesterone alters counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia in conscious male rats.The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that antecedent short-term administration of estradiol or progesterone into the central nervous system (CNS) reduces levels of neuroendocrine counterregulatory hormones during subsequent hypoglycemia. Conscious unrestrained male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied during randomized 2-day experiments. Day 1 consisted of an 8-h lateral ventricle infusion of estradiol (1 mug/mul; n = 9), progesterone (1 mug/mul; n = 9), or saline (0.2 mul/min; n = 10). On day 2, a 2-h hyperinsulinemic (30 pmol.kg(-1).min(-1)) hypoglycemic (2.9 +/- 0.2 mM) clamp was performed on all rats. Central administration of estradiol on day 1 resulted in significantly lower plasma epinephrine levels during hypoglycemia compared with saline, whereas central administration of progesterone resulted in increased levels of plasma norepinephrine and decreased levels of corticosterone both at baseline and during hypoglycemia. Glucagon responses during hypoglycemia were unaffected by prior administration of estradiol or progesterone. Endogenous glucose production following day 1 estradiol was significantly lower during day 2 hypoglycemia, and consequently, the glucose infusion rate to maintain the glycemia was significantly greater after estradiol administration compared with saline. These data suggest that 1) CNS administration of both female reproductive hormones can have rapid effects in modulating levels of counterregulatory hormones during subsequent hypoglycemia in conscious male rats, 2) forebrain administration of reproductive hormones can significantly reduce pituitary <e>adrenal</e> and sympathetic nervous system drive during hypoglycemia, 3) reproductive steroid hormones produce differential effects on sympathetic nervous system activity during hypoglycemia, and 4) reduction of epinephrine resulted in significantly blunted metabolic counterregulatory responses during hypoglycemia.",M1

Ten-week-old male SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats were administered fasudil (10 mg/kg/day s.c.) for 4 days. Systolic blood pressure was measured using the tail-cuff method. Catecholamine levels were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography-ECD methods. Tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels were measured in Western blot analysis. The tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA level was measured using real-time PCR methods. Fasudil significantly decreased systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, but not in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Fasudil also significantly decreased catecholamine, tyrosine hydroxylase protein, and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels in the adrenal medulla of spontaneously hypertensive rats. These results suggest that the depressor effects of fasudil on hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats may be related to inhibition of the catecholamine synthetic pathway.",M1
17827042,"Attenuated adrenergic responses to exercise in women with fibromyalgia--a controlled study.The pathogenesis of widespread pain and fibromyalgia (FM) is unknown. Altered responses from the hypothalamus-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> axis, sympathetic nervous system and muscular system have been suggested as being of importance. The present study was undertaken to determine: (i) whether the sympathoadrenal response to repetitive isometric contractions until exhaustion is altered in patients with FM, and (ii) whether sympathoadrenal responses are associated with muscle fatigue and pain during exercise. Nineteen women with FM, and 19 healthy women matched for age, smoking and self-reported physical activity, participated. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), repetitive isometric contractions (6s contraction and 4s resting phases) were performed with both quadriceps muscles at 30% of MVC until exhaustion. Muscle activity was recorded from the quadriceps muscles by surface electromyography (EMG). Plasma adrenalin (Adr), noradrenalin (NAdr) and cortisol were measured and perceived exertion and pain reported during exercise. Attenuated Adr responses (p&lt;0.001) with normal plasma NAdr and cortisol (p&gt;0.19) responses were found during exercise in the FM group compared with the control group. Significantly higher EMG amplitude (%EMG(max)) during the contraction phases (p=0.001) was found in the FM than in the control group. Perceived exertion and pain responses to exercise were higher in the FM group than in the controls (p&lt;0.001), without relationship to the sympathoadrenal responses. In conclusion; the exercise was perceived as being more painful and strenuous in the FM group. Muscle performance was altered with increased muscle activity during the exercise. Women with FM showed an attenuated Adr response to repetitive isometric exercise.",M1
17766707,"Reduced epinephrine reserve in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients with pituitary adenoma.OBJECTIVE: Hypoglycemia induces rapid secretion of counterregulatory hormones such as catecholamine, glucagon, cortisol, and GH. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia is used for evaluating GH-IGF-I and ACTH-<e>adrenal</e> axes in patients with pituitary disorders. The aim of this study was to determine whether the response of catecholamine secretion to hypoglycemia is disrupted in patients with pituitary adenoma. METHODS: The study population comprised 23 patients with pituitary adenoma (non-functioning adenoma or prolactinoma). An insulin tolerance test was performed and serum catecholamines as well as plasma GH and serum cortisol were measured. RESULTS: The study patients showed diminished response of plasma epinephrine to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. With the cutoff level of peak epinephrine for defining severe impairment set at 400 pg/ml, more patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency showed severe impairment of the epinephrine response than did those without it. Peak epinephrine levels to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were significantly correlated with peak cortisol levels. In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, secondary hypogonadism, GH deficiency, or diabetes insipidus, the prevalence of severe impairment of the epinephrine response was similar to that in patients without these deficiencies. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired epinephrine secretion in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was frequently observed in patients with pituitary adenoma. This disorder was especially severe in patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency.",M1
17702843,"Differential activation of the sympathetic innervation of adipose tissues by melanocortin receptor stimulation.Melanocortins are implicated in the control of energy intake/expenditure. Centrally administered melanotan II (MTII), a synthetic melanocortin 3/4-receptor agonist, decreases adiposity beyond that accountable by food intake decreases. Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) mRNA is expressed on sympathetic nervous system (SNS) outflow neurons to white adipose tissue (WAT) in Siberian hamsters, suggesting a role in lipid mobilization. Therefore, we tested whether third ventricular injections of MTII increased sympathetic drive to WAT and interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) using norepinephrine turnover (NETO) as a measure of sympathetic drive. We also tested for MTII-induced changes in lipolysis-related WAT gene expression (beta3-adrenoceptors, hormone sensitive lipase) and IBAT thermogenesis (beta3-adrenoceptor, uncoupling protein-1). Finally, we tested whether third ventricularly injected MTII, a highly selective MC4-R agonist (cyclo[beta-Ala-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Glu]NH2) increased or agouti-related protein decreased IBAT temperature in hamsters implanted with sc IBAT temperature transponders. Centrally administered MTII provoked differential sympathetic drives to WAT and IBAT (increased inguinal WAT, dorsosubcutaneous WAT and IBAT NETO, but not epididymal WAT and retroperitoneal WAT NETO). MTII also increased circulating concentrations of the lipolytic products free fatty acids and glycerol but not plasma catecholamines, suggesting lipid mobilization via WAT SNS innervation and not via <e>adrenal</e> medullary catecholamines. WAT or IBAT gene expression was largely unaffected by acute MTII treatment, but IBAT temperature was increased by MTII and the MC4-R agonist and decreased by agouti-related protein. Collectively, this is the first demonstration of central melanocortin agonist stimulation of WAT lipolysis through the SNS and confirms melanocortin-induced changes in BAT thermogenesis.",M1

One of the neuronal regulators of CRH neurons is neuropeptide Y (NPY) contained in axons that densely innervate CRH neurons. The three main sources of NPY innervation of the PVN are the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and the noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons of the brainstem. To elucidate the origin of the NPY-immunoreactive (NPY-IR) innervation to hypophysiotropic CRH neurons, quadruple-labeling immunocytochemistry for CRH, NPY, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase was performed. Approximately 63% of NPY-IR varicosities on the surface of CRH neurons were catecholaminergic (22% noradrenergic and 41% adrenergic), and 37% of NPY-IR boutons were noncatecholaminergic. By triple-labeling immunofluorescence detection of NPY, CRH, and agouti-related protein, a marker of NPY axons projecting from the arcuate nucleus, the noncatecholaminergic, NPY-ergic axon population was shown to arise primarily from the arcuate nucleus. When NPY was administered chronically into the cerebral ventricle of fed animals, a dramatic reduction of CRH mRNA was observed in the PVN (NPY vs. control integrated density units, 23.9 +/- 2.7 vs. 77.09 +/- 15.9). We conclude that approximately two thirds of NPY-IR innervation to hypophysiotropic CRH neurons originates from catecholaminergic neurons of the brainstem, whereas the remaining one third arises from the arcuate nucleus. The catecholaminergic NPY innervation seems to modulate the activation of CRH neurons in association with glucoprivation and infection, whereas the NPY input from the arcuate nucleus may contribute to inhibition of CRH neurons during fasting.",M1
17679462,"High risk of malignancy in patients with incidentally discovered <e>adrenal</e> masses: accuracy of adrenal imaging and image-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology.AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The incidental finding of nonfunctioning adrenal masses (incidentalomas) is common, but no reliable criteria in differentiating between benign and malignant adrenal masses have been defined. The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the usefulness of adrenal imaging and image-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology in patients with nonfunctioning adrenal incidentalomas with the aim of excluding or confirming malignancy before surgery. METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients (18 men and 24 women; median age, 54 years; range, 25-75 years) with incidentally discovered adrenal masses of 3 cm or more in the greatest diameter were prospectively enrolled in the study. All patients underwent helical computerized tomography scan and image-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology, 33 (78.6%) underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and 26 (61.9%) underwent norcholesterol scintigraphy before adrenalectomy. RESULTS: The revised final pathology showed 30 (71.4%) benign (26 adrenocortical adenomas, of which 3 were atypical, 2 ganglioneuromas, and 2 nonfunctioning benign pheochromocytomas) and 12 (28.6%, 95% CI = 15-42) adrenal malignancies (8 adrenocortical carcinomas and 4 unsuspected adrenal metastases). The definitive diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinoma was made according to Weiss criteria and confirmed on the basis of local invasion at surgery or metastases. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 75%, 67% and 83% for computerized tomography scan, 92%, 95% and 94% for magnetic resonance imaging, 89%, 94% and 92% for norcholesterol scintigraphy, and 92%, 100% and 98% for fine-needle aspiration cytology. The sensitivity and accuracy of image-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology and magnetic resonance imaging together reached 100%. Immediate periprocedural complications of fine-needle aspiration cytology occurred in 2 (4.7%) patients: self-limited pneumothorax (n = 1), and severe pain (n = 1) requiring analgesic therapy. No postprocedural or late complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: With the aim of selecting for surgery patients with a non-functioning adrenal incidentaloma of 3 cm or more in diameter, the combination of magnetic resonance imaging and fine-needle aspiration cytology should be considered the strategy of choice.",M1

17628524,"Roles of brain phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase in centrally administered histamine-induced adrenomedullary outflow in rats.Recently, we reported that intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered histamine evokes the secretion of noradrenaline and adrenaline from <e>adrenal</e> medulla by brain cyclooxygenase-1- and thromboxane A2-mediated mechanisms in rats. These results suggest the involvement of brain arachidonic acid cascade in the histamine-induced activation of the central adrenomedullary outflow. Arachidonic acid is released mainly by phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-dependent pathway or phospholipase C (PLC)/diacylglycerol lipase-dependent pathway. In the present study, histamine (27 nmol/animal, i.c.v.) -induced elevation of plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline was dose-dependently reduced by U-73122 (PLC inhibitor) (10 and 100 nmol/animal, i.c.v.), ET-18-OCH3 (phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC inhibitor) (10 and 30 nmol/animal, i.c.v.) and RHC-80267 (diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor) (1.3 and 2.6 micromol/animal, i.c.v.). However, mepacrine (PLA2 inhibitor) (1.1 and 2.2 micromol/animal, i.c.v.) and D609 (phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC inhibitor) (30, 100 and 300 nmol/animal, i.c.v.) had no effect. These results suggest the involvement of brain phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC and diacylglycerol lipase in the centrally administered histamine-induced activation of the adrenomedullary outflow in rats.",M1
17597596,"Heterozygous alpha 2C-adrenoceptor-deficient mice develop heart failure after transverse aortic constriction.OBJECTIVE: Feedback regulation of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves is essential to control blood pressure, heart rate and contractility. Recent experiments in gene-targeted mice have suggested that alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors may operate in a similar feedback mechanism to control the release of epinephrine from the <e>adrenal</e> medulla. As heterozygous polymorphisms in the human alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor gene have been associated with cardiovascular disease including hypertension and chronic heart failure, we have sought to characterize the relevance of alpha(2C)-gene copy number for feedback control of epinephrine release in gene-targeted mice. METHODS: Adrenal catecholamine release, basal hemodynamics and susceptibility to develop heart failure after transverse aortic constriction were tested in mice with two copies (+/+), one copy (+/-) or no functional alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor gene (alpha(2C)-/-). RESULTS: Heterozygous alpha(2C)-receptor deletion (alpha(2C)+/-) resulted in a 43% reduction of adrenal alpha(2C) mRNA copy number and in a similar decrease in alpha(2)-receptor-mediated inhibition of catecholamine release from isolated adrenal glands in vitro. Urinary excretion of epinephrine was increased by 74+/-15% in alpha(2C)+/- and by 142+/-23% in alpha(2C)-/- mice as compared with wild-type control mice. Telemetric determination of cardiovascular function revealed significant tachycardia but no hypertension in alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor-deficient mice. alpha(2C)+/- mice were more susceptible to develop cardiac hypertrophy, failure and mortality after left-ventricular pressure overload than alpha(2C)+/+ mice. CONCLUSION: Adrenal alpha(2)-mediated feedback regulation of epinephrine secretion differs fundamentally from sympathetic feedback control. A single adrenoceptor subtype, alpha(2C), operates without a significant receptor reserve to prevent elevation of circulating epinephrine levels. This genetic model may provide an experimental basis to study the pathophysiology of alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor dysfunction in humans.",M1
17576304,"Neurobiological alterations associated with traumatic stress.PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe the effects of traumatic stress on brain structure and function, and the relationship of these neurobiological changes to symptoms experienced after trauma. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to traumatic stress is associated with changes in the limbic system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> axis, and key monoamine neurotransmitters. Different neurobiological alterations can be linked to specific symptoms of hyperarousal, dissociation/numbing, and reexperiencing of the trauma. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Understanding what is happening in the brain can inform more targeted treatment for various symptoms that the individual may be experiencing.",M1
17535996,"Patients with classic congenital <e>adrenal</e> hyperplasia have decreased epinephrine reserve and defective glycemic control during prolonged moderate-intensity exercise.CONTEXT: Patients with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) have adrenomedullary dysplasia and hypofunction, and their lack of adrenomedullary reserve has been associated with a defective glucose response to brief high-intensity exercise. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess hormonal, metabolic, and cardiovascular response to prolonged moderate-intensity exercise comparable to brisk walking in adolescents with classic CAH. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We compared six adolescents with classic CAH (16-20 yr old) with seven age-, sex-, and body mass index group-matched controls (16-23 yr old) using a 90-min standardized ergometer test. Metabolic, hormonal, and cardiovascular parameters were studied during exercise and recovery. RESULTS: Glucose did not change throughout exercise and recovery for controls, whereas CAH patients showed a steady decline in glucose during exercise with an increase in glucose in the postexercise period. Glucose levels were significantly lower in CAH patients at 60 (P = 0.04), 75 (P = 0.01), and 90 (P = 0.03) min of exercise and 15 (P = 0.02) min post exercise, whereas glucose levels were comparable between the two groups early in exercise and at 30 min (P = 0.19) post exercise. As compared with controls, CAH patients had significantly lower epinephrine (P = 0.002) and cortisol (P &lt; or = 0.001) levels throughout the study and similar norepinephrine, glucagon, and GH levels. Patients with CAH and controls had comparable cardiovascular parameters and perceived level of exertion. Despite having lower glucose levels, insulin levels were slightly higher in CAH patients during the testing period (P = 0.17), suggesting insulin insensitivity. CONCLUSION: CAH patients have defective glycemic control and altered metabolic and hormonal responses during prolonged moderate-intensity exercise comparable to brisk walking.",M1
17459596,"Induction of DNA damage, alteration of DNA repair and transcriptional activation by stress hormones.Stress is associated with increased production of sympathetic and other <e>adrenal</e> hormones. Epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE) and cortisol are produced during psychological stress and may affect many cells directly. These effects may be transient (e.g. heart rate, immune cell trafficking) or they can have more long-lasting consequences, such as permanent DNA damage which may result in increased cell transformation and/or tumorigenicity. Here, the molecular effects of short term in vitro exposure of these stress hormones were analyzed on murine 3T3 cells by measuring effects on DNA damage and repair, cell transformation and changes in mRNA expression of genes specifically involved in DNA damage signaling pathways. Short-term exposure (&lt;30 min) to physiological concentrations of either cortisol, NE or E induced at least five-fold increases in DNA damage in treated cells compared to untreated controls. Pre-treatment with blocking agents such as the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486, or the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, eliminated this increase in damage. Both cortisol and NE interfered with repair of DNA damage in cells exposed to UV and resulted in an increase in the transformed phenotype. In contrast, E had none of these effects on 3T3 cells. Stress hormones had no significant effects on cell cycle regulation. Targeted gene arrays showed that cortisol, NE and E modulated the transcription of 21, 14 and 18 genes, respectively. These genes were directly related to DNA damage signaling pathways, and included up-regulation of DNA damage sensors Chk1 and Chk2, and the proto-oncogene CDC25A, which is involved in cell cycle delay following DNA damage. Taken together, these data show that stress hormones can increase DNA damage and transformation and alter transcriptional regulation of the cell cycle.",M1
17448453,"Cardiac epinephrine synthesis and ischemia-induced myocardial epinephrine release.OBJECTIVE: Phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT), the enzyme that synthesizes epinephrine (EPI) from norepinephrine (NE) in the <e>adrenal</e> gland, is present in extra-adrenal tissues including heart. Ischemia evokes an excessive NE accumulation in the myocardial interstitial spaces. Therefore, cardiac PNMT activity with high NE levels may contribute to cardiac EPI synthesis and release evoked by ischemia. METHODS: We measured dialysate EPI levels in the left ventricle of anesthetized rabbits using a cardiac microdialysis technique. The dialysate EPI level served as an index of the myocardial interstitial EPI level. Locally administered NE-induced dialysate EPI responses were measured. The left circumflex coronary artery was occluded for 60 min and the dialysate EPI and NE levels in the ischemic region were measured. Coronary occlusion-induced EPI responses were compared with and without administration of a PNMT inhibitor (SKF29661) in the presence and absence of desipramine (catecholamine transport blocker). RESULTS: Local administration of NE (250, 2500 ng/ml) increased the EPI levels to 734+/-125 and 2088+/-367 pg/ml respectively. These increases in dialysate EPI were suppressed by the PNMT inhibitor. Acute myocardial ischemia significantly increased the EPI levels to 3607+/-1069 pg/ml in the ischemic region, and these were suppressed by the PNMT inhibitor (1417+/-581 pg/ml). The pretreatment with desipramine suppressed ischemia-induced EPI release, which did not differ with (725+/-155 pg/ml) and without administration of a PNMT inhibitor (743+/-172 pg/ml). CONCLUSION: The cardiac PNMT in the left ventricle is capable of synthesizing EPI with markedly elevated NE levels in the myocardial interstitial space.",M1
17440230,"The role of prednisolone and epinephrine on gastric tissue and erythrocyte antioxidant status in adrenalectomized rats.It has been believed that overproduction of free radicals and/or deficiency of antioxidant systems, and stress hormones may play a role in etiopathogenesis of many diseases, including gastric ulcer. This study evaluated whether there was an effect of adrenalectomy on lipid peroxidation [malondialdehyde (MDA)] and antioxidant [superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione (GSH) levels] systems in gastric tissue and erythrocyte in rats. As well, the impacts of administration of prednisolone and epinephrine on these systems in adrenalectomized rats were investigated. Thirty-three rats were randomly grouped as sham-operated (group I), adrenalectomized (group II), adrenalectomized + prednisolone (group III) and adrenalectomized + epinephrine (group IV). After experimental procedures, blood and gastric tissues samples were taken from each animal in all groups. Colorimetric assays were employed to determine gastric tissue and erythrocyte levels of MDA and GSH, and SOD and GPX activities. Adrenalectomy in group II rats caused a marked decrease of SOD and GPX activities and MDA levels, and an increase of GSH levels in gastric tissue and erythrocyte, when compared to sham-operated rats. However, especially epinephrine injection after adrenalectomy resulted in a significantly increase of measured antioxidant enzyme activities and GSH levels in both gastric tissue and erythrocyte. These results indicate that adrenalectomy appeared to alter the levels of antioxidants and lipid peroxidation product in gastric tissue and erythrocyte. Thus, the present study provides a physiological regulatory role of <e>adrenal</e> gland in the maintenance of oxidant/antioxidant balance in gastric tissue and erythrocyte.",M1
17420440,"Perfectionism and the cortisol response to psychosocial stress in men.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that perfectionism is an important moderator of the neuroendocrine stress response, with higher perfectionism predicting increased neuroendocrine activation. METHODS: A total of 50 middle-aged men underwent an acute standardized psychosocial stress task (Trier Social Stress Test). Perfectionism, cognitive appraisal of the stressful situation, trait anxiety, and various personality characteristics were assessed with questionnaires. Salivary cortisol, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine, blood pressure, and heart rate were analyzed before and after stress. Circadian profiles of cortisol secretion during the day and in response to awakening were analyzed to assess basal activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> (HPA) axis. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of the neuroendocrine stress response. RESULTS: Perfectionism was significantly associated with area under the total response curve with respect to increase (AUCi) of cortisol (r = 0.322, p = .046), but not with AUCi of norepinephrine (r = -0.217, p = .152) or AUCi of epinephrine (r = 0.116, p = .477). Hence, AUCi of cortisol was the main criterion. As possible predictors, trait anxiety, neuroticism, vital exhaustion, secondary appraisal, depression, and openness were considered. Regression analyses demonstrated that only perfectionism (beta = 0.45, p = .002) and secondary appraisal (beta = 0.50, p = .001) were independent predictors of AUCi of cortisol, the final model explaining 45% of the total variance in cortisol response (R2 = 0.45,  shrunken  R2 [sR2] = 0.38); perfectionism alone accounted for 18% of this variance (deltaR2 = 0.18, sR2 = 0.19). CONCLUSION: The typical cognitions, and presumably the associated emotions, of perfectionists seem to contribute independently to stress-induced bodily responses, including HPA axis activation, in response to psychosocial stress.",M1
17394532,"Stress-induced changes in epinephrine expression in the <e>adrenal</e> medulla in vivo.Immobilization (IMMO) stress was used to examine how stress alters the stress hormone epinephrine (EPI) in the adrenal medulla in vivo. In rats subjected to IMMO for 30 or 120 min, adrenal corticosterone increased to the same extent. In contrast, EPI changed very little, suggesting that EPI synthesis replenishes adrenal pools and sustains circulating levels for the heightened alertness and physiological responses of the 'flight or fight' response. In part, stress activates EPI via the phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) gene as single or repeated IMMO elevated PNMT mRNA. The rise in PNMT mRNA was preceded by induction of the PNMT gene activator, Egr-1, with increases in Egr-1 mRNA, protein, and protein-DNA binding complex apparent. IMMO also evoked changes in Sp1 mRNA, protein, and Sp1-DNA complex formation, although for chronic IMMO changes were not entirely coincident. In contrast, glucocorticoid receptor and AP-2 mRNA, protein, and protein-DNA complex were unaltered. Finally, IMMO stress elevated PNMT protein. However, with seven daily IMMOs for 120 min and delayed killing, protein stimulation did not attain the highly elevated levels expected based on mRNA changes. The latter may perhaps suggest initiation of adrenergic desensitization to prolonged and repeated IMMO stress and/or dissociation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.",M1
17372719,"Indirect role of alpha2-adrenoreceptors in anti-ulcer effect mechanism of nimesulide in rats.Nimesulide, a non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug, produces ulcerogenic effects in adrenalectomized rats but is gastro-protective in intact rats. The objective of this study was to determine whether <e>adrenal</e> gland hormones are involved in the anti-ulcer effects of nimesulide. The results revealed that 100 mg/kg nimesulide produces gastric ulceration in adrenalectomized rats, which is prevented by prednisolone and adrenaline. The anti-ulcer effects of adrenaline and prednisolone in adrenalectomized rats were in turn antagonized by yohimbine, a selective alpha(2)-receptor blocker, but not by doxazosine (alpha(1)-receptor blocker) or propranolol (beta-blocker). Adrenaline prevented the formation of indomethacin-induced ulcers in both adrenalectomized and intact rats, but prednisolone increased the indomethacin-induced ulcerous area in intact rats, whereas it decreased the size of the ulcers in adrenalectomized rats. In addition, prednisolone prevented ulcer formation in intact rats in which the adrenaline concentration had been decreased by metyrosine. These results suggest that glucocorticoids are anti-ulcerogenic in not only adrenalectomized rats but also in intact rats with diminished circulating levels of adrenaline. In the light of these data, the effect of nimesulide on plasma adrenaline concentrations was studied. In comparison to the adrenaline levels found in intact control rats, the administration of nimesulide at doses of 10, 20, 40 and 100 mg/kg decreased adrenaline concentrations by 12.8, 22.6, 30.4, and 58.2%, respectively, without affecting blood corticosterone concentrations. The anti-ulcer effect of nimesulide was observed to be dose-dependent, and the strength of this effect was directly correlated the decreasing concentration of adrenaline. The concentration of adrenaline was decreased by 60.9% in rats treated with 300 mg/kg metyrosine in which prednisolone produced anti-ulcer effects. In summary, we have shown that nimesulide produces its anti-ulcer effect by decreasing endogenous adrenaline concentrations and that glucocorticoids may induce anti-ulcer effects via alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors, but not via their own receptors.",M1
17350615,"<e>Adrenal</e> adrenaline- and noradrenaline-containing cells and celiac sympathetic ganglia are differentially controlled by centrally administered corticotropin-releasing factor and arginine-vasopressin in rats.The adrenal glands and sympathetic celiac ganglia are innervated mainly by the greater splanchnic nerves, which contain preganglionic sympathetic nerves that originated from the thoracic spinal cord. The adrenal medulla has two separate populations of chromaffin cells, adrenaline-containing cells (A-cells) and noradrenaline-containing cells (NA-cells), which have been shown to be differentially innervated by separate groups of the preganglionic sympathetic neurons. The present study was designed to characterize the centrally activating mechanisms of the adrenal A-cells, NA-cells and celiac sympathetic ganglia with expression of cFos (a marker for neural excitation), in regard to the brain prostanoids, in anesthetized rats. Intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) induced cFos expression in the adrenal A-cells, but not NA-cells, and celiac ganglia. On the other hand, i.c.v. administered arginine-vasopressin (AVP) resulted in cFos induction in both A-cells and NA-cells in the adrenal medulla, but not in the celiac ganglia. Intracerebroventricular pretreatment with indomethacin (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase) abolished the CRF- and AVP-induced cFos expression in all regions described above. On the other hand, intracerebroventricular pretreatment with furegrelate (an inhibitor of thromboxane A2 synthase) abolished the CRF-induced cFos expression in the adrenal A-cells, but not in the celiac ganglia, and also abolished the AVP-induced cFos expression in both A-cells and NA-cells in the adrenal medulla. These results suggest that centrally administered CRF activates adrenal A-cells and celiac sympathetic ganglia by brain thromboxane A2-mediated and other prostanoid than thromboxane A2 (probably prostaglandin E2)-mediated mechanisms, respectively. On the other hand, centrally administered AVP activates adrenal A-cells and NA-cells by brain thromboxane A2-mediated mechanisms in rats.",M1

17241180,"Mechanisms of exercise-induced ST-segment depression in patients without typical angina pectoris.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if exercise-induced ST-segment depression without typical angina pectoris is related to increases in sympatho-<e>adrenal</e> activity or beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients (four men) aged 35-62 years with ST-segment depression during exercise but atypical symptoms and normal myocardial scintigraphy, and 13 matched controls. DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: Patients and controls were compared regarding responses with: (i) exercise testing without treatment, (ii) exercise testing following beta-adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol (0.15 mg kg(-1) i.v.), (iii) incremental adrenaline infusions (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 nmol kg(-1) min(-1)) and (iv) adrenaline infusions during alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by phentolamine (0.5 mg min(-1)). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ST-segment depression and tissue Doppler parameters reflecting contractility. RESULTS: Exercise lowered the ST-segment by 2.44 mm without and 0.87 mm with beta-adrenoceptor blockade (P &lt; 0.001 for difference) amongst patients, but not amongst controls. Maximal heart rate was slightly higher amongst patients (P &lt; 0.05), despite similar loads and plasma catecholamine responses to exercise in the two groups; this difference disappeared after beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol. ST-segment depression during adrenaline infusion was greater in patients compared with controls (P &lt; 0.01) despite similar increases in heart rate. alpha-Blockade enhanced the ST-segment depression (P &lt; 0.001) and heart rate (P &lt; 0.001) responses to adrenaline infusion more markedly amongst patients. Tissue Doppler imaging showed similar contractility and diastolic relaxation responses of patients and controls to adrenaline, but early diastolic movements did not increase amongst patients after phentolamine (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise-induced ST-segment depression in patients with a low likelihood of ischaemic heart disease is related to increased beta-adrenergic sensitivity regarding chronotropic and electrophysiological, but not inotropic responses.",M1
17176640,"A nonpungent component of steamed ginger--[10]-shogaol--increases adrenaline secretion via the activation of TRPV1.We investigated the components of ginger that are involved in increasing body temperature. Gingerols ([6,8,10]-gingerols) and shogaols ([6,8,10]-shogaols) having different alkyl carbon chain lengths were targeted. All the gingerols and shogaols increased intracellular calcium concentration in rat transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1)-expressing HEK293 cells via TRPV1. In this regard, the shogaols were more potent than the gingerols. Aversive responses were induced by [6]-, [10]-gingerol, and [6]-shogaol (5 mmol/l) in rats when these compounds were applied to the eye; however, no response was observed in response to [10]-shogaol (5 and 10 mmol/l). [10]-Shogaol induced nociceptive responses via TRPV1 in rats following its subcutaneous injection into the hindpaw; the pungent compound capsaicin (CAP) and [6]-shogaol were observed to have similar effects. Moreover, <e>adrenal</e> catecholamine secretion, which influences energy consumption, was promoted in rats in response to [6]- and [10]-gingerols and [6]- and [10]-shogaols (1.6 micromol/kg, i.v.). [10]-Shogaol-induced adrenaline secretion was inhibited by administration of capsazepine, a TRPV1 antagonist. In conclusion, gingerols and shogaols activated TRPV1 and increased adrenaline secretion. Interestingly, [10]-shogaol is the only nonpungent compound among the gingerols and shogaols, suggesting its usefulness as a functional ingredient in food.",M1
17097811,"Attenuation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> axis responsivity to the Trier Social Stress Test by the benzodiazepine alprazolam.Little is known about effects of commonly used anxiolytic drugs on psychologically evoked responses of two major stress systems, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis. The purpose of the present study was to assess effects of the anxiolytic alprazolam on responses of the HPA and the SAM axes to a standardized psychosocial stress protocol, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Forty-six healthy, non-smoking, non-medicated males, aged between 18 and 45 years, were invited once to the laboratory and received a single oral dose of 1mg alprazolam or placebo, respectively, 1h prior to the TSST. The secretion of ACTH, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine as well as changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and psychological states (anxiety, wakefulness, good mood, calmness) in response to the TSST were measured. Subjects pre-treated with alprazolam showed a strongly blunted response of ACTH as well as total and free cortisol to the TSST. Whereas alprazolam-treated subjects displayed significantly lower systolic blood pressure immediately before the TSST, neither the secretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine nor changes of heart rate in response to the stress test differed from placebo-treated subjects. Regarding psychological parameters, alprazolam clearly decreased subjective ratings on the questionnaire scale  wakefulness  and increased ratings on the scale  good mood , whereas ratings on scales assessing  state anxiety  or  agitation  were not affected. In healthy subjects, we observed a dissociation of the effects of alprazolam on the endocrine and the autonomic response to psychosocial stress. The psychological responses seemed to be masked by sedative properties of alprazolam.",M1
17075569,"Alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes involved in the regulation of catecholamine release from the <e>adrenal</e> medulla of mice.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was carried out to elucidate which alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtypes mediated the inhibition of noradrenaline and adrenaline release from the adrenal medulla of mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Isolated adrenal medullae from wild-type and alpha(2A), alpha(2B) and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor knockout (KO) mice were placed in superfusion chambers. Catecholamine overflow was evoked by 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (500 microM) in absence or in presence of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist medetomidine. The effect of medetomidine was tested in presence of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists rauwolscine, WB 4101, spiroxatrine, phentolamine and prazosin. KEY RESULTS: In wild-type mice, medetomidine reduced noradrenaline and adrenaline overflow in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50) in nM: 1.54 and 1.92; E(max) in % of inhibition: 91 and 94, for noradrenaline and adrenaline, respectively). The pK (D) values of the antagonists for noradrenaline overflow did not correlate with pK(D) values at alpha(2A), alpha(2B), or alpha(2C) binding sites. The pK (D) values of the antagonists for adrenaline overflow correlated positively with pK(D) values at alpha(2C) binding sites (opossum kidney cells). The effect of medetomidine (100 nM) on noradrenaline overflow was significantly reduced in all three alpha(2)KO mice (57, 54, 44 % inhibition, for alpha(2A), alpha(2B), and alpha(2C), respectively), whereas the effect of medetomidine on adrenaline overflow was greatly reduced in alpha(2C)KO mice (14 % inhibition). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In the adrenal medulla of mice, all three alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha(2A), alpha(2B), and alpha(2C)) play an equal role in the inhibition of noradrenaline overflow, whereas the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor is the predominant alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtype involved in the inhibitory mechanism controlling adrenaline overflow.",M1
17026994,"Effect of levofloxacin on serum glucose concentration in rats.To clarify the mechanism of fluoroquinolone-induced abnormalities in blood glucose, the effect of levofloxacin on serum glucose concentration was investigated in rats. Rats received an intravenous injection of levofloxacin and their arterial blood was sampled periodically. The serum glucose concentration decreased after an injection of 100 mg/kg of levofloxacin, while it increased at levofloxacin 300 mg/kg. The serum immunoreactive insulin concentration increased as the dose of levofloxacin increased. The serum epinephrine concentration was rapidly elevated by levofloxacin at 300 mg/kg. The serum histamine concentration increased after injections of levofloxacin, 200 and 300 mg/kg. Diphenhydramine (1 mg/kg) antagonized the hyperglycemia induced by 300 mg/kg of levofloxacin. In an in vitro study, the release of epinephrine from the <e>adrenal</e> medulla in the presence of levofloxacin was determined. Levofloxacin (300 microg/ml) did not affect epinephrine release from the adrenal medulla. Levofloxacin can induce hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in rats.

17002930,"Evolution of a pheochromocytoma.OBJECTIVE: To present a case that demonstrates the evolution of a pheochromocytoma over a several-year period and to emphasize the importance of a thorough work-up for pheochromocytoma in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and hypertension. METHODS: We review the long-term clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings in a man with a complex medical history of hypertension, NF1, and cardiomyopathy. RESULTS: A 44-year-old man, with a well-documented history of headaches, hypertension, and NF1, was referred for evaluation of a right <e>adrenal</e> enlargement. He had developed cardiomyopathy and undergone an evaluation for cardiac transplantation. Initial computed tomography revealed subtle asymmetry in the upper right adrenal gland. Biochemical studies for pheochromocytoma yielded equivocal findings, with a 1.5-fold elevation in the urinary norepinephrine and near-normal urinary metanephrine level. Because 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging showed no tracer uptake in the area of the right adrenal gland, the patient was thought not to have a pheochromocytoma. The patient eventually underwent cardiac transplantation and did well. On reassessment 3 1/2 years later, he was found to have a larger right adrenal mass. The second endocrine evaluation demonstrated substantial elevation in the urinary metanephrine level, and the patient underwent laparoscopic right adrenalectomy to remove the tumor (3.5 by 3.0 by 2.5 cm), which proved to be a pheochromocytoma. CONCLUSION: This case shows that a pheochromocytoma can be difficult to diagnose and can evolve to become a large, biochemically active tumor. It is imperative that patients with an adrenal tumor undergo periodic reevaluation to ensure that the tumor remains stable in size. If the tumor enlarges, further biochemical testing is warranted.",M1
16962713,"An activity-dependent increased role for L-type calcium channels in exocytosis is regulated by adrenergic signaling in chromaffin cells.Chromaffin cells of the <e>adrenal</e> medulla represent a primary output of the sympathetic nervous system. Their electrical stimulation evokes the fusion of large dense core granules with the cell membrane and the exocytic release of multiple transmitter molecules into the circulation. There the transmitters contribute to the regulation of basic metabolism of the organism. Under physiological activity, granule fusion and transmitter release are limited by activity-dependent Ca(2+) influx, entering through multiple isoforms of voltage-gated calcium channels. In this study we utilize perforated-patch voltage-clamp recordings and depolarize mouse chromaffin cells in situ with action potential-like waveforms to mimic physiological firing. We measure calcium influx through specific isoforms and measure cell capacitance as an index of granule fusion. Combining these approaches we calculate specific stimulus-secretion efficiencies for L-type, N-type, P/Q-type and R-type calcium channels under varied physiological activity levels. Current influx through all channel subtypes exhibited an activity-dependent depression. As expected P/Q-type channels, while responsible for modest Ca(2+) influx, are tightly coupled to catecholamine secretion under all conditions. We further find that stimulation designed to match sympathetic input under the acute stress response recruits L-type channels to a state of enhanced stimulus-secretion efficiency. N- and R-type channels do not undergo activity-dependent recruitment and remain loosely coupled to the secretion. Thus, only L-type channels exhibit activity-dependent changes in their stimulus-secretion function under physiological stimulation. Lastly, we show that treatment with the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, specifically blocks the increase in the stimulus-secretion function of L-type channels. Thus, increased cell firing specifically enhances stimulus-secretion coupling of L-type Ca(2+) channels in chromaffin cells in situ. This mechanism is regulated by an adrenergic signaling pathway.",M1

16887153,"Hindbrain catecholamine neurons control multiple glucoregulatory responses.Reduced brain glucose availability evokes an integrated constellation of responses that protect and restore the brain's glucose supply. These include increased food intake, <e>adrenal</e> medullary secretion, corticosterone secretion and suppression of estrous cycles. Our research has focused on mechanisms and neural circuitry underlying these systemic glucoregulatory responses. Using microinjection techniques, we found that localized glucoprivation of hindbrain but not hypothalamic sites, elicited key glucoregulatory responses, indicating that glucoreceptor cells controlling these responses are located in the hindbrain. Selective destruction of hindbrain catecholamine neurons using the retrogradely transported immunotoxin, anti-dopamine beta-hydroxylase conjugated to saporin (DSAP), revealed that spinally-projecting epinephrine (E) or norepinephrine (NE) neurons are required for the adrenal medullary response to glucoprivation, while E/NE neurons with hypothalamic projections are required for feeding, corticosterone and reproductive responses. We also found that E/NE neurons are required for both consummatory and appetitive phases of glucoprivic feeding, suggesting that multilevel collateral projections of these neurons coordinate various components of the behavioral response. Epinephrine or NE neurons co-expressing neuropeptide Y (NPY) may be the neuronal phenotype required for glucoprivic feeding: they increase NPY mRNA expression in response to glucoprivation and are nearly eliminated by DSAP injections that abolish glucoprivic feeding. In contrast, lesion of arcuate nucleus NPY neurons, using the toxin, NPY-saporin, does not impair glucoprivic feeding or hyperglycemic responses. Thus, hindbrain E/NE neurons orchestrate multiple concurrent glucoregulatory responses. Specific catecholamine phenotypes may mediate the individual components of the overall response. Glucoreceptive control of these neurons resides within the hindbrain.",M1

16802547,"[Diagnosis and therapy of endocrine hypertension]Once the diagnosis of hypertension is established, secondary forms should be considered. Especially hormonally active <e>adrenal</e> tumors may allow specific treatment. For primary hyperaldosteronism plasma aldosterone to active renin concentration ratio in patients with plasma aldosterone levels &gt; or = 200 ng/l is a reliable screening method under random conditions. A salt loading test may confirm a primary aldosteronism. A unilateral adrenal adenoma has to be separated from bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. To exclude Cushing's syndrome, the dexamethasone challenge is a reliable screening parameter. Patients with Cushing's syndrome may have an elevated urinary free cortisol and the circadian rhythm may be abolished resulting in an elevated 23:00 h serum cortisol. Alternatively, cortisol may be measured in saliva using specific cutoffs. Determinations of 24-h urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine levels are established diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Metanephrines, which are metabolites of catecholamines, have been suggested as an alternative more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool. In conclusion, recently established biochemical methods are reliable screening parameters for the diagnosis of adrenal hypertension. Endocrine hypertension due to adrenal tumors may be treated by minimally invasive surgery or specific antihypertensive treatment.",M1
16777938,"Chronic intermittent hypoxia induces hypoxia-evoked catecholamine efflux in adult rat <e>adrenal</e> medulla via oxidative stress.Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) augments physiological responses to low partial pressures of O2 in the arterial blood. Adrenal medullae from adult rats, however, are insensitive to direct effects of acute hypoxia. In the present study, we examined whether CIH induces hypoxic sensitivity in the adult rat adrenal medulla and, if so, by what mechanism(s). Experiments were performed on adult male rats exposed to CIH (15 s of 5% O2 followed by 5 min of 21% O2; 9 episodes h(-1); 8 h d(-1); for 3 or 10 days) or to comparable, cumulative durations of continuous hypoxia (CH; 4 h of 7% O2 followed by 20 h of 21% O2 for 1 or 10 days). Noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (ADR) effluxes were monitored from ex vivo adrenal medullae. In adrenal medullae of rats exposed to CIH, acute hypoxia evoked robust NA and ADR effluxes, whereas these responses were absent in control rats or in those exposed to CH for 1 or 10 days. Hypercapnia (10% CO2; either acidic, pH 6.8, or isohydric, pH 7.4) was ineffective in eliciting catecholamine (CA) efflux from control, CIH or CH rats. Nicotine (100 microM) evoked NA and ADR effluxes in control rats, and this response was abolished in CIH but not in CH rats. Systemic administration of 2-deoxyglucose depleted ADR content in control rats, and CIH attenuated this response, indicating downregulation of neurally regulated CA secretion. Cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitase enzyme activities decreased in CIH adrenal medullae, suggesting increased generation of superoxide anions. Systemic administration of antioxidants reversed the effect of CIH on the adrenal medulla. Rats exposed to CIH exhibited increased blood pressures and elevated plasma CA, and antioxidants abolished these responses. These observations demonstrate that CIH induces hypoxic sensing in the adult rat adrenal medulla via mechanisms involving increased generation of superoxide anions and suggest that hypoxia-evoked CA efflux from the adrenal medulla contributes, in part, to elevated blood pressure and plasma CA.",M1
16765344,"Centrally administered histamine evokes the <e>adrenal</e> secretion of noradrenaline and adrenaline by brain cyclooxygenase-1- and thromboxane A2-mediated mechanisms in rats.Plasma adrenaline is originated from adrenal medulla, while plasma noradrenaline reflects the release from sympathetic nerves in addition to the secretion from adrenal medulla. The present study was designed to characterize the source of plasma catecholamines induced by centrally administered histamine, with regard to the brain prostanoids. Intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered histamine (1, 5 and 10 microg/animal) elevated plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline (noradrenaline&lt;adrenaline) in a dose-dependent manner. Ketoprofen (a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-1) (100, 250 and 500 microg/animal, i.c.v.) dose-dependently reduced the histamine (5 microg/animal, i.c.v.)-induced elevation of both catecholamines, while NS-398 (a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2) (250 and 500 microg/animal, i.c.v.) had no effect. The histamine-induced response was dose-dependently attenuated by furegurelate (an inhibitor of thromboxane A(2) synthase) (250 and 500 microg/animal, i.c.v.), and abolished by acute bilateral adrenalectomy. These results suggest that centrally administered histamine evokes plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline from adrenal medulla by brain cyclooxygenase-1- and thromboxane A(2)-mediated mechanisms in rats.",M1
16757126,"Factor XII (Hageman factor) is a missing link between stress and hypercoagulability and plays an important role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke.A new hypothesis is presented on the function of factor XII, which is postulated to be a  missing link  between acute stress and transient hypercoagulability. The implications of this idea are developed to show how chronic stress, which involves activation of hypertension and migraine as well as hypercoagulability, can cause of cerebrovascular disease.  Acute stress  is defined as  the normal short-term physiological response to the perception of major threats or demands .  Chronic stress  is  the abnormal ongoing physiological response to the continuing perception of unresolvable major threats or demands . The factor XII hypothesis is as follows: Acute stress includes release of epinephrine by the <e>adrenal</e> medulla. Epinephrine activates platelets by binding to alpha-2A adrenergic receptors. Activated platelets convert pre-bound factor XII to its active form, which then initiates the intrinsic coagulation cascade. This can be called the  activated platelet initiation pathway  for coagulation. Neither tissue factor nor pre-formed thrombin is required. Thrombosis proceeds to completion, but only a minute amount of thrombin is formed, and the process normally stops at this point. In people who lapse into a state of chronic stress, essential hypertension, which is also a manifestation of stress, synergizes with hypercoagulability: there is both a baseline rise in blood pressure and systemic platelet activation as well as superimposed labile rises of both. Upregulation of these two stress parameters is atherogenic: epinephrine-activated platelets stimulating thrombin formation interact with endothelial cells activated by angiotensin II to cause, first, smooth muscle cell proliferation, which is a histological hallmark of atherosclerosis, and, lastly, a symptomatic thrombotic occlusion-the stroke. The migraine symptoms which often accompany this process are a marker of chronic stress and ongoing pathophysiologic damage. Therapeutic predictions are made regarding novel ways of blocking stress-induced hypercoagulability and hypertension. Hypercoagulability could be targeted by monoclonal antibodies directed against the platelet-specific alpha-2 adrenergic receptor or the (putative) platelet receptor for Factor XII; hypertension could be treated with monoclonal antibodies directed against the beta-adrenergic receptor in the juxtaglomerular apparatus or by surgical denervation of the kidneys, either of which would decrease the renin release which helps drive the hypertension.",M1
16696852,"Identification of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase gene expression in stellate ganglia and its modulation by stress.Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT, EC 2.1.1.28) is the terminal enzyme of the catecholaminergic pathway converting noradrenaline to adrenaline. Although preferentially localized in <e>adrenal</e> medulla, evidence exists that PNMT activity and gene expression are also present in the rat heart, kidney, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, thymus, retina and different parts of the brain. However, data concerning PNMT gene expression in sympathetic ganglia are still missing. In this study, our effort was focused on identification of PNMT mRNA and/or protein in stellate ganglia and, if present, testing the effect of stress on PNMT mRNA and protein levels in this type of ganglia. We identified both PNMT mRNA and protein in stellate ganglia of rats and mice, although in much smaller amounts compared with adrenal medulla. PNMT gene expression and protein levels were also increased after repeated stress exposure in stellate ganglia of rats and wild-type mice. Similarly to adrenal medulla, the immobilization-induced increase was probably regulated by glucocorticoids, as determined indirectly using corticotropin-releasing hormone knockout mice, where immobilization-induced increase of PNMT mRNA was suppressed. Thus, glucocorticoids might play an important role in regulation of PNMT gene expression in stellate ganglia under stress conditions.",M1
16691441,"Gene expression of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in corticotropin-releasing hormone knockout mice during stress exposure.1. AIMS: Epinephrine (EPI) synthesizing enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT, EC 2.1.1.28) is primarily localized in the <e>adrenal</e> medulla (AM). We have recently described existence of the PNMT gene expression in cardiac atria and ventricles and in sympathetic ganglia of adult rats and mice. The aim of the present work was to study regulation of the PNMT gene expression in corticotropin-releasing hormone knockout mice (CRH KO) and matched control wild-type mice (WT) under normal and stress conditions. 2. METHODS: Levels of the PNMT mRNA were determined by RT-PCR; PNMT immunoprotein and protein of transcription factor EGR-1 by Western Blot. Plasma EPI and corticosterone (CORT) levels were determined by radioenzymatic and RIA methods. Immobilization (IMMO) was used as a stressor. 3. RESULTS: Stress-induced increases in the PNMT mRNA and protein levels observed in WT mice were almost completely absent in CRH KO mouse adrenal medulla, stellate ganglia, and cardiac atria, while ventricular PNMT mRNA elevation was not CRH-dependent. Plasma EPI and CORT levels were markedly reduced in CRH KO compared to WT mice both before and after the stress. Levels of EGR-1, crucial transcription factor for regulation of the PNMT were highly increased in stressed WT and CRH KO mice in cardiac areas, but not in the adrenal medulla. 4. CONCLUSIONS: Data show that the CRH deficiency can markedly prevent immobilization-triggered induction of the PNMT mRNA and protein levels in the adrenal medulla and stellate ganglia. Reduced plasma epinephrine and corticosterone levels and adrenal medullary EGR-1 protein levels in CRH knockout versus WT mice during stress indicate that the HPA axis plays a crucial role in regulation of the PNMT gene expression in these organs. Cardiac atrial PNMT gene expression with stress is also dependent on intact HPA axis. However, in cardiac ventricles, especially after the single stress exposure, its expression is not impaired by CRH deficiency. Since cardiac EGR-1 protein levels in CRH KO mice are also not affected by the single stress exposure, we propose existence of different regulation of the PNMT gene expression, especially in the cardiac ventricles.Overall, our findings reveal that the PNMT gene expression is regulated through the HPA in both sympathoadrenal system and the heart and also via EGR-1 in the adrenal medulla, but apparently not in the heart. Regulation of the PNMT gene expression in various compartments of heart includes both corticosterone-dependent and independent mechanisms.",M1
16645894,"Epinephrine biosynthesis: hormonal and neural control during stress.1. Stress contributes to the pathophysiology of many diseases, including psychiatric disorders, immune dysfunction, nicotine addiction and cardiovascular illness. Epinephrine and the glucocorticoids, cortisol and corticosterone, are major stress hormones. 2. Release of epinephrine from the <e>adrenal</e> medulla and glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex initiate the biological responses permitting the organism to cope with adverse psychological, physiological and environmental stressors. Following its massive release during stress, epinephrine must be restored to replenish cellular pools and sustain release to maintain the heightened awareness and sequelae of responses to re-establish homeostasis and ensure survival. 3. Epinephrine is regulated in part through its biosynthesis catalyzed by the final enzyme in the catecholamine pathway, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (E.C. 2.1.1.28, PNMT). PNMT expression, in turn, is controlled through hormonal and neural stimuli, which exert their effects on gene transcription through protein stability. 4. The pioneering work of Julius Axelrod forged the path to our present understanding of how the stress hormone and neurotransmitter epinephrine, is regulated, in particular via its biosynthesis by PNMT.",M1
16636975,"Absence of exercise-induced leptin suppression associated with insufficient epinephrine reserve in patients with classic congenital <e>adrenal</e> hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.OBJECTIVE: Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency suffer from glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency. They have insufficient epinephrine reserves and increased basal leptin levels and are often insulin resistant. In healthy subjects, an inhibitory effect of acute catecholamine elevation on the leptin plasma concentrations has been reported. However, it is not yet known how leptin levels respond to exercise in CAH patients. METHODS: We performed a cycle ergometer test in six CAH patients to measure the response of plasma leptin, glucose and the catecholamines, epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (N), as well as their respective metabolites, metanephrine (M) and normetanephrine (NM), to intense exercise. RESULTS: Baseline leptin concentrations in CAH patients were not different from those of controls. Leptin levels decreased significantly with exercise in healthy controls, whereas they remained unchanged in CAH patients. In contrast to controls, CAH patients showed no rise of plasma glucose. Basal and stimulated E and M levels were significantly lower in CAH patients compared to controls. Baseline and stimulated N and NM levels were comparable, showing a significant rise after exercise. Peak systolic blood pressure and peak heart rate in both groups were comparable. CONCLUSION: CAH patients do not manifest exercise-induced leptin suppression. The most probable reason for this is their severely impaired epinephrine stress response. In addition, epinephrine deficiency is leading to secondary changes in various catecholamine dependent metabolic pathways, e. g., energy balance. Although obvious clinical sequelae are so far unknown, the catecholamine-deficient state and the resulting hyperleptinemia might contribute to the severity of the disease in CAH.",M1
16626867,"I.c.v. administration of the nonsteroidal glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, CP-472555, prevents exacerbated hypoglycemia during repeated insulin administration.Hypoglycemia elicits an integrated array of CNS-mediated counterregulatory responses, including activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> axis. The role of antecedent adrenocortical hypersecretion in impaired glucose counterregulation remains controversial. The present studies utilized the selective, nonsteroidal glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, CP-472555, as a pharmacological tool to investigate the hypothesis that hypoglycemic hypercorticosteronemia modulates CNS efferent autonomic and neuroendocrine motor responses to recurring insulin-induced hypoglycemia via glucocorticoid receptor-dependent mechanisms. Groups of adult male rats were injected s.c. with either one or four doses of the intermediate-acting insulin, Humulin neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH), on as many days, while controls were injected with diluent alone. Animals injected with four doses of insulin were pretreated by i.c.v. administration of graded doses of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist or vehicle alone prior to the first three doses of insulin. Repeated daily injection of NPH exacerbated hypoglycemia, attenuated patterns of glucagon and epinephrine secretion, and diminished neuronal transcriptional activation in discrete CNS metabolic loci, including the lateral hypothalamic area, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. While i.c.v. delivery of 25 or 100 ng doses of CP-472555 did not alter any of these parameters, animals treated with 500 ng exhibited circulating glucose, glucagon, and epinephrine levels that were similar to those in rats injected with one dose of insulin, as well as a reversal of recurring insulin-induced hypoglycemia-associated reductions in Fos immunolabeling in the lateral hypothalamic area, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, and paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. These results provide unique pharmacological evidence that antecedent activation of central glucocorticoid receptor is required for exacerbation of hypoglycemia during recurring insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and that these receptors mediate modulatory effects of hypoglycemic hypercorticosteronemia on autonomic efferent responses to recurring insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The data also suggest that neurons in central loci characterized here by antagonist-mediated overturn of recurring insulin-induced hypoglycemia-induced decreases in neuronal transcriptional activation may be direct or indirect substrates for this hormonal modulation action.",M1
16612252,"The chromogranin A fragment catestatin: specificity, potency and mechanism to inhibit exocytotic secretion of multiple catecholamine storage vesicle co-transmitters.BACKGROUND: Secretory granules of chromaffin cells and neurons co-store and release, by exocytosis, the acidic soluble protein chromogranin A (human, CHGA; rodent, Chga) along with catecholamines, neuropeptides and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). CHGA serves as a pro-protein and upon proteolytic cleavage it generates active peptides, including catestatin (human CHGA352-372), first discovered in <e>adrenal</e> medullary chromaffin granules. Studies in our laboratory demonstrated that catestatin acts at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to inhibit catecholamine secretion. However, the specificity of catestatin to exert nicotinic-cholinergic antagonism among its co-transmitters is not clearly known, nor is the potential effect of catestatin on multiple vesicle co-transmitters understood. AIM: Here we probed the specificity of catestatin's actions among its co-transmitters: catecholamines, ATP, and neuropeptide Y (NPY). METHODS: We studied the effects of each transmitter on exocytotic secretion of its co-transmitters from PC12 chromaffin cells, stimulating secretion by triggering physiological pathways at multiple sites. RESULTS: We observed that, among chromaffin granule co-transmitters, only catestatin and NPY inhibited catecholamine release induced by nicotinic-cholinergic stimulation; catestatin was more than tenfold more potent than NPY in this setting. We also stimulated norepinephrine secretion by other chromaffin cell agonists: catestatin blocked norepinephrine release induced by nicotine, but not by other agents (such as membrane depolarization) acting at later stages in the secretory pathway, nor by agents acting on other receptor classes. By contrast, NPY acted less specifically, blocking norepinephrine release triggered by either nicotine or membrane depolarization. Catestatin inhibited nicotinic-cholinergic co-release of all classes of chromaffin granule co-transmitters: catecholamines, chromogranins, neuropeptides, and ATP. Naturally occurring variants of human catestatin (Gly364Ser and Pro370Leu) exhibited parallel changes in potency to inhibit secretion of catecholamines and ATP. CONCLUSION: We conclude that, among the chromaffin granule co-transmitters, catestatin acts as the most specific and potent inhibitor of physiological pathway (nicotinic-cholinergic) stimulated secretion. Furthermore, catestatin generally inhibits nicotinically triggered exocytotic release of multiple co-transmitters from chromaffin granules. The results have physiological and pharmacological implications for co-transmission in the sympathochromaffin system.",M1
16567532,"Blockade of GABA(A) receptors in the ventromedial hypothalamus further stimulates glucagon and sympathoadrenal but not the hypothalamo-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> response to hypoglycemia.Hypoglycemia provokes a multifaceted counterregulatory response involving the sympathoadrenal system, stimulation of glucagon secretion, and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis that is commonly impaired in diabetes. We examined whether modulation of inhibitory input from gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), a major glucose-sensing region within the brain, plays a role in affecting counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia. Normal Sprague-Dawley rats had carotid artery and jugular vein catheters chronically implanted, as well as bilateral steel microinjection guide cannulas inserted down to the level of the VMH. Seven to 10 days following surgery, the rats were microinjected with artificial extracellular fluid, the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (1 nmol/side), or the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide (12.5 pmol/side) before being subjected to a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic (2.5 mmol/l) glucose clamp for 90 min. Following VMH administration of bicuculline methiodide, glucose infusion rates were significantly suppressed, whereas muscimol raised glucose infusion rates significantly compared with controls. Glucagon and epinephrine responses were elevated with the antagonist and suppressed with the agonist compared with controls. Corticosterone responses, however, were unaffected by either administration of the agonist or antagonist into the VMH. These data demonstrate that modulation of the GABAergic system in the VMH alters both glucagon and sympathoadrenal, but not corticosterone, responses to hypoglycemia. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that GABAergic inhibitory tone within the VMH can modulate glucose counterregulatory responses.",M1
16473331,"Adrenergic nerves mediate the venoconstrictor response to PVN stimulation.Veins play an important role in the control of venous return, cardiac output and cardiovascular homeostasis. However, the central nervous system sites and effector systems involved in modulating venous function remain to be fully elucidated. The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is an important site modulating autonomic outflow to the cardiovascular system. Venous tone can be modulated by sympathetic nerves or by <e>adrenal</e> catecholamines. The present study assessed the relative contribution of these autonomic effector systems to the venoconstrictor response elicited by stimulation of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sham operation or bilateral adrenal demedullation fitted with PVN guide cannulae and fitted with catheters for recording arterial pressure (AP) and intrathoracic vena caval pressure (VP). A latex balloon was advanced into the right atrium. MCFP was calculated from the AP and VP recorded after 4 s of right atrial occlusion. MCFP = VP + (AP - VP)/60. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), VP and MCFP responses to injections of BMI (25 ng/side) into the PVN were recorded from conscious rats to avoid the complicating effects of anesthesia. In sham-operated rats, injection of BMI into the PVN increased MAP by 13 +/- 3 mm Hg and HR by 56 +/- 6 bpm. MCFP was also increased significantly by 0.98 +/- 0.15 mm Hg indicating an increase in venomotor tone. Adrenal medullectomy did not affect the pressor (DeltaMAP = 12 +/- 2 mm Hg), tachycardic (DeltaHR = 48 +/- 7 bpm) or venoconstrictor (DeltaMCFP = 0.73 +/- 0.11 mm Hg) responses. Ganglionic blockade abolished the PVN-induced responses in both groups of rats. In a separate group, pretreatment with the adrenergic neuron blocker, guanethidine (20 mg/kg), also abolished the PVN-mediated venoconstrictor responses. Conversely, selective beta2 adrenergic receptor blockade did not affect MCFP responses to BMI. These data indicate that adrenomedullary catecholamines are not necessary for full expression of the venoconstrictor response to PVN stimulation.",M1

The recent observation by our group of an <e>adrenal</e> myxoid tumor with morphologically borderline features, but aggressive clinical behavior prompted us to review a series of 196 adrenocortical lesions, comprising 122 carcinomas and 74 adenomas, to define the morphologic, phenotypical and clinical characteristics of adrenocortical tumors with myxoid features. Fourteen cases, including 12 carcinomas and 2 borderline tumors, formed the basis of this report, and were characterized by a variably abundant myxoid component (from 5% to 90% of tumor) and 2 distinct cellular growth patterns: the first (10 cases), mostly associated with a predominant myxoid stromal component, was made of small cells with mild atypia arranged in cords and microcysts; the second (4 cases) was characterized by focal myxoid changes in tumors otherwise similar to conventional adrenocortical carcinoma, with large atypical cells having an eosinophilic cytoplasm and a diffuse or nodular architecture. The above mentioned patterns were absent in all adenomas reviewed. A peculiar reactivity to neurofilaments was seen, mostly associated to the presence of predominant rather that focal myxoid stromal changes, and in 40% of conventional adrenocortical carcinomas, thus representing an undescribed potential pitfall in the differential diagnosis of adrenal lesions. Myxoid adrenocortical tumors probably represent a rare but histologically and phenotipically distinct entity and, although rare cases of benign lesions are on record, they seem to be generally associated to morphologic and clinical features of malignancy.",M2
20521756,"Radiologic evaluation of incidentally discovered <e>adrenal</e> masses.The increasing use of cross-sectional imaging has led to an increase in the incidental discovery of adrenal masses (adrenal incidentalomas). Although most of these lesions are benign, they often present a diagnostic dilemma. Before creating a management plan, the physician should determine if the lesion is benign or malignant and if the lesion is functioning or nonfunctioning. Incidentally discovered adrenal masses usually are benign adenomas; however, myelolipomas, cysts, hemorrhage, pheochromocytomas, metastases, and adrenocortical carcinomas are also possible. Unenhanced computed tomography and chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging can characterize most adenomas because the lesions have high lipid content. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography can further characterize the adenomas because of the washout characteristics with iodinated intravenous contrast media. Fluorodeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography can be helpful in characterizing some lesions, and biopsy is rarely required. This article summarizes the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for the use of imaging modalities and biopsy to characterize incidentally discovered adrenal masses.",M2

Results were compared with those of CT and shift magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 1832 cancer patients who had undergone FDG PET/CT scans were retrospectively evaluated. Visual interpretation, tumour maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)), liver SUV(max) and tumour/liver SUV(max) ratios were correlated with the findings of CT, shift MRI and final diagnosis (based on biopsy or clinical/radiological follow-up). A total of 109 adrenal masses were found: 49 were malignant and 60 were benign on final diagnosis. A tumour/liver SUV(max) ratio threshold of 1.0 was more accurate in differentiating the tumour type than tumour SUV(max) or visual interpretation alone. Diagnostic accuracy of CT and shift MRI (92 - 97%) was similar to that for FDG PET/CT (94 - 97%). In conclusion, FDG PET/CT accurately characterizes adrenal tumours, with excellent sensitivity and specificity. Use of 1.0 as the threshold for the tumour/liver SUV(max) ratio seems to be promising for distinguishing benign from malignant adrenal masses in cancer patients.",M2

PATIENTS: Four males (aged 10 to 15 years) were evaluated for systolic blood pressures consistently above the 99.6th percentile. All were overweight with BMI ranging from 27-35. Clinical examinations, renal ultrasound and DMSA scans were normal. Plasma electrolytes, renin, aldosterone, cortisol, testosterone, ACTH and TSH were normal. 24-Hour urinary steroid profiles showed a generalised excess of adrenal androgen and cortisol metabolites in all cases. Relevant recognised disorders of adrenal androgen and cortisol metabolism were excluded. CONCLUSION: There is no clinical condition explaining these abnormal urinary steroid profiles. These results support previous findings and provide new data on abnormal urinary adrenal androgen excretion in obese hypertensive patients. Further studies may determine the relationship between obesity, hypertension and the observed abnormalities of urinary steroid excretion.",M2
20463057,"Feedback inhibition of human scavenger receptor class B type I gene expression by glucocorticoid in <e>adrenal</e> and ovarian cells.Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) facilitates the reverse transport of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver via high-density lipoproteins. In steroidogenic tissues, SR-BI supplies cholesterol for steroid hormone production. We show here that the transcription of the human SR-BI gene is subject to feedback inhibition by glucocorticoid in adrenal and ovarian cells. SR-BI mRNA levels were increased in adrenals from corticosterone-insufficient Crh(-/-) mice, whereas corticosterone replacement by oral administration inhibited SR-BI gene expression in these mice. SR-BI mRNA levels were increased in adrenals from wild-type mice treated with metyrapone, a drug that blocks corticosterone synthesis. Experiments in adrenocortical H295R and ovarian SKOV-3 cells using cycloheximide and siRNA-mediated gene silencing revealed that glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of SR-BI gene transcription requires de novo protein synthesis and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). No direct binding of GR to the SR-BI promoter could be demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, suggesting an indirect mechanism of repression of SR-BI gene transcription by GR in adrenal cells. Deletion analysis established that the region of the human SR-BI promoter between nucleotides -201 and -62 is sufficient to mediate repression by glucocorticoid. This region contains putative binding sites for transcriptional repressors that could play a role in SR-BI gene regulation in response to glucocorticoid. In summary, this is the first report showing that glucocorticoid suppress SR-BI expression suggesting that steroidogenic tissues maintain steroid hormone homeostasis by prohibiting SR-BI-mediated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol uptake when the endogenous levels of glucocorticoid are elevated.",M2
20460654,"Behavioral and <e>adrenal</e> responses to various stressors in mule ducks from different commercial genetic selection schemes and their respective parental genotypes.The mule duck, a hybrid produced by crossing a Muscovy drake and a Pekin female, is reported to express inappropriate behavior such as collective avoidance of people, the resulting distress and physical consequences potentially compromising their welfare. The present study was carried out to characterize the responses of mule duck strains from different commercial selection schemes to various stressful conditions and to confirm previous data on the genetic cross effects observed in a specific genotype. Three independent experiments were conducted with ducks from 3 French breeding companies (A, B, and C). Each experiment compared 2 mule genotypes sharing one common parental origin (paternal for ducks from company A or maternal for ducks from companies B and C). Mule duck males from the 2 genotypes and their respective parental genotypes (Pekin and Muscovy) were subjected to a set of social and stressful physiological and behavioral tests. Previously reported differences in genetic cross effects on fear responses between the parental genotypes and the corresponding hybrid were confirmed in these commercial crosses. Both mule duck and Pekin genotypes showed more active physiological and behavioral responses to stress than Muscovy genotypes. The new finding of this study is that mule genotypes appear to be more sensitive to the social environment than both respective parental genotypes. Few differences were observed between the 2 mule genotypes from A and C. On the other hand, several traits of the 2 mule genotypes from B differed. In addition, A and C mule genotypes were characterized by the same adrenal and behavioral traits but contrasting responses. The B mule genotypes were characterized by a different set of behavioral traits, and only 1 of the 2 B mule ducks was characterized by a group of adrenal traits.",M2
20432817,"Testosterone-metabolizing capacity and characteristics of <e>adrenal</e> microsomes in human fetus in vitro.We describe the metabolite spectrum of testosterone (T) in human fetal adrenal in vitro, and verify possible roles of CYP3A and 2C isoforms of human fetal adrenal in T metabolism which respond to T metabolism in liver. Isolation and identification of T and its metabolites were carried out by isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography. CYP isoforms involved in T metabolism were examined by an inhibition study. Four metabolites formed by fetal adrenal microsomes were androstenedione (A), 16alpha-hydroxytestosterone (16alpha-HT), 16beta-hydroxytestosterone (16beta-HT) and 6beta-hydroxytestosterone (6beta-HT), which made up 61%, 25%, 12% and 2%, respectively, of the total. However, fetal liver microsomes produced six metabolites, which were, from high to low: A, 2alpha-HT, 6beta-HT, 2beta-HT, 16beta-HT and 16alpha-HT. Generation of A, 16alpha-HT and 16beta-HT in the adrenals was much greater than that in the liver. Erythromycin inhibited the formation of 6beta-HT and 16beta-HT with maximal inhibition of 76% and 47%. Sulfaphenazole and omeprazone had no inhibitive effect on the formations of T metabolites. The predominant metabolites of T in fetal adrenal, A and 16alpha-HT, were not decreased by these three inhibitors. These results suggest that the human fetal adrenal has greater T-metabolizing ability and a different metabolizing pathway from adult and fetal liver. Some other CYPs but not CYP3A7, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 might play the most important part in the metabolism of T in human fetal adrenal although CYP3A7 is responsible for the formation of 6beta-HT and partly participates in the formation of 16beta-HT.",M2

The extraction procedure significantly reduced 17OHP by eliminating interfering steroids in children &lt; 1 year. Sexual dimorphism was only observed in NE-17OHP. 17OHP in PT was always higher than in FT up to 2 months of age (p &lt; 0.001). Neither NE- nor E-17OHP in CAH overlapped with those of FT or PT (p &lt; 0.001) allowing to omit the extraction procedure to confirm CAH diagnosis. Cortisol levels were within normal range in neonates with CAH, thus not adding useful information about <e>adrenal</e> function.

20423713,"Selective stimulation by cinnamaldehyde of progesterone secretion in human <e>adrenal</e> cells.AIMS: Cinnamon bark has been used to treat menstrual pain and infertility. While several pharmacological studies have suggested anti-inflammatory properties, the mechanisms by which the herb exerts its various activities have not been well understood. Recent reports suggest menstrual distress is related to higher estradiol levels, higher estradiol/progesterone ratios. Cinnamaldehyde, a major active constituent of Cinnamomum cassia has been shown to stimulate cathecholamine release from adrenal glands. The objective of the present study is to examine whether cinnamaldehyde stimulates secretion of progesterone and other steroid hormones in human adrenal cells. MAIN METHODS: Human adrenal cells, H295R were exposed for 24h in a serum-free medium to various concentrations of cinnamaldehyde. Steroid hormones in the cultured medium were measured by a highly sensitive LC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. KEY FINDINGS: Exposure to cinnamaldehyde increased progesterone release in a dose-dependent manner. Testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone concentrations decreased in the presence of cinnamaldehyde. The release of cortisol or estradiol was not affected by treatment with cinnamaldehyde. cAMP in the cultured medium was increased from 0.06+/-0.0007pmol/ml to 0.12+/-0.0028pmol/ml by exposure to cinnamaldehyde. The addition of isobutylmehtylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, caused a doubling of the amount of cAMP up to 0.397+/-0.036pmol/ml in the presence of cinnamaldehyde. SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that cinnamaldehyde selectively induced progesterone production and inhibited production of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone in human adrenal cells.",M2

SF1 not only defines the steroidogenic lineages in these organs but also controls their differentiation. Recent evidence implicates the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway as a downstream regulator of SF1 in the appearance of steroidogenic cells in these organs. The Hh signaling pathway serves as a common crosstalk component, yet has evolved diverse functions in the expansion and differentiation of the steroidogenic cells in a tissue-specific manner. The purpose of this review is to compare and contrast the different roles of Hh signaling in these three organs during development.",M2
20410472,"Dose-response downregulation within the span of single interpulse intervals.Pituitary ACTH drives <e>adrenal</e> glucocorticoid (cortisol) pulses via a time-delayed asymptotic dose-response process. To test the postulate that ACTH stimulates cortisol secretion dynamically (unequally during the initiation and termination of a cortisol secretory burst), a mathematical formalism was developed in which dose-response hysteretic shifts were allowed, but not required, within the time evolution of ACTH-cortisol pulse pairs. A dual-waveform deconvolution model was used to quantify cortisol secretion rates and reconstruct ACTH concentration profiles in 28 healthy adults previously sampled every 10 min for 24 h in the unstressed state (8,120 measurements). ACTH concentration-cortisol secretion dose-response functions were then estimated in each subject 1) without hysteresis (base model) and with allowances for possible hysteresis in 2) ACTH potency, 3) adrenal sensitivity, and 4) ACTH efficacy. Model residual error was 40% lower in the potency and sensitivity models and 20% lower in the efficacy model than in the base model (P &lt; 0.001). Mean time shifts for inferable hysteretic inflection were model-independent, i.e., grand mean (95% confidence interval) 22 (12-39) min after the onset of a cortisol secretory burst. Half-maximally effective ACTH concentrations (EC(50)) differed before and after hysteretic inflection within individual pulses: 1) 9.4 and 54 ng/l in the potency model (P &lt; 0.001) and 2) 8.9 and 123 ng/l in the sensitivity model (P &lt; 0.001) compared with 16 ng/l in the no-hysteresis model (P &lt; 0.001). In the efficacy-shift model, estimated maximal ACTH drive varied by 17-fold within cortisol secretory bursts (from 22 to 1.3 nmol.l(-1).min cortisol secretion(-1), P &lt; 0.001). The collective results introduce the basis for modeling the dynamics of rapid, reversible physiological downregulation within the span of single interpulse intervals in vivo. This construct should have utility in parsing mechanisms of physiological regulation in other integrative systems.",M2
20404726,"<e>Adrenal</e> function in HIV infection.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Adrenal dysfunction can increase morbidity and mortality among patients with HIV infection. Disorders and medications affecting cortisol, aldosterone or adrenal androgens in patients with HIV infection are reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal suppression from concomitant use of ritonavir with nonsystemic corticosteroids such as intra-articular triamcinolone in addition to the previously reported interactions with inhaled fluticasone are increasingly recognized in HIV patients. Integrated measure of aldosterone throughout the day is higher in patients with HIV-associated visceral adipose tissue accumulation. SUMMARY: Abnormalities in adrenal function are more common in HIV patients than in the general population. HIV care providers should pursue workup for adrenal dysfunction in HIV patients when symptoms or signs are present, especially in patients with advanced AIDS or receiving medications that can affect adrenal function. The clinical implications of aldosterone elevation in HIV patients with visceral adiposity will need to be examined in future research studies.",M2
20398019,"An endocrinologist's view on relative adrenocortical insufficiency in rheumatoid arthritis.The concept of relative <e>adrenal</e> insufficiency (RAI) has been originally introduced to describe a situation in which critically ill patients, without any prior risk or evidence for adrenal insufficiency, have total serum cortisol levels inadequate for the severity of patients' illness. The concept provided a framework for other disease states, in which higher than normal adrenal function could be expected, such as in chronic inflammation. An intense research in RAI field highlighted some new methodological aspects that significantly improved assessment of adrenal function in chronic illness. Measurement of salivary cortisol may provide additional information on locally available cortisol in target tissues. Low levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) for given age and gender were confirmed as a simple and reliable indicator of decreased adrenal function, even in subjects with normal baseline cortisol or normal corticotropin-stimulated cortisol response. Combined lower DHEAS and lower baseline cortisol levels could be an example of hypocompetence of adrenocortical function, yet clinically not apparent.",M2

METHODS: The authors report the use of ciclesonide to reverse adrenal suppression secondary to inhaled fluticasone use in four pediatric patients. RESULTS: In these four children, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function normalized after the patients were changed to ciclesonide, while good asthma control was maintained. CONCLUSIONS: Ciclesonide should be considered for the reversal of adrenal suppression secondary to the use of fluticasone, and perhaps other older inhaled corticosteroids as well.",M2
20393161,"Regular exercise prevents the development of hyperglucocorticoidemia via adaptations in the brain and <e>adrenal</e> glands in male Zucker diabetic fatty rats.We determined the effects of voluntary wheel running on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the peripheral determinants of glucocorticoids action, in male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Six-week-old euglycemic ZDF rats were divided into Basal, Sedentary, and Exercise groups (n = 8-9 per group). Basal animals were immediately killed, whereas Sedentary and Exercising rats were monitored for 10 wk. Basal (i.e., approximately 0900 AM in the resting state) glucocorticoid levels increased 2.3-fold by week 3 in Sedentary rats where they remained elevated for the duration of the study. After an initial elevation in basal glucocorticoid levels at week 1, Exercise rats maintained low glucocorticoid levels from week 3 through week 10. Hyperglycemia was evident in Sedentary animals by week 7, whereas Exercising animals maintained euglycemia throughout. At the time of death, the Sedentary group had approximately 40% lower glucocorticoid receptor (GR) content in the hippocampus, compared with the Basal and Exercise groups (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting that the former group had impaired negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis. Both Sedentary and Exercise groups had elevated ACTH compared with Basal rats, indicating that central drive of the axis was similar between groups. However, Sedentary, but not Exercise, animals had elevated adrenal ACTH receptor and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein content compared with the Basal animals, suggesting that regular exercise protects against elevations in glucocorticoids by a downregulation of adrenal sensitivity to ACTH. GR and 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 content in skeletal muscle and liver were similar between groups, however, GR content in adipose tissue was elevated in the Sedentary groups compared with the Basal and Exercise (P &lt; 0.05) groups. Thus, the gradual elevations in glucocorticoid levels associated with the development of insulin resistance in male ZDF rats can be prevented with regular exercise, likely because of adaptations that occur primarily in the adrenal glands.",M2

Cortisol secretion can be regulated by aberrant hormone receptors. OBJECTIVE: A large series of patients with AIMAH were evaluated to provide information on the prevalence and profile of aberrant regulations, in relation with the functional status. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Thirty-two consecutive patients with AIMAH were prospectively studied: 10 had a Cushing's syndrome (CS), and 22 had a subclinical CS (SCS). METHODS: A baseline endocrine evaluation was followed by an in vivo protocol in search of aberrant cortisol responses (seven provocative tests). An acute inhibition test with the somatostatin analog octreotide was also performed. RESULTS: At least one aberrant cortisol response was identified in 28 of 32 (87%) patients. The overall prevalence of aberrant responses was independent of the functional status. Responses to the upright posture and to metoclopramide were frequently observed (67 and 56% respectively). A glucagon response was frequently observed in the SCS group (58%). A cortisol inhibition by octreotide was specifically found in the three CS patients who positively responded to the mixed meal, and was observed also in 12 of 13 (92%) patients with SCS. CONCLUSIONS: Cortisol responses indicative of aberrant receptor expression were highly prevalent in AIMAH. Thorough phenotyping of AIMAH may help uncover the underlying pathophysiology.",M2
20371661,"Prepubertal adrenarchal androgens and animal protein intake independently and differentially influence pubertal timing.CONTEXT: Whether adrenarche impacts on pubertal development is controversial. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the associations of <e>adrenal</e> androgen (AA) secretion with early and late pubertal markers, independent of potential influences of dietary animal protein intake. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective cohort study of healthy free-living Caucasian children (n = 109) who provided both 24-h urine samples and 3-d weighed dietary records 1 and 2 yr before the biological age at take-off of the pubertal growth spurt (ATO). MEASUREMENTS: Twenty-four-hour excretion rates of androgen (C19) metabolites quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were measured. MAIN OUTCOMES: ATO, age at peak height velocity (APHV), age at menarche/voice break, duration of pubertal growth acceleration, and ages at Tanner stage 2 for breast (girls) and genital (boys) development (B2-G2) and pubic hair (PH2). RESULTS: Higher adrenarchal C19 steroids predicted earlier ages at Tanner stage 2 for pubic hair (P &lt; 0.0001) and B2-G2 (P = 0.009) as well as a shorter pubertal growth acceleration period (P = 0.001), independently of animal protein intake. Children with a higher AA secretion had a 1.5-yr earlier beginning of pubarche and a 0.8-yr earlier beginning of B2-G2 than those with a lower AA excretion. Furthermore, animal protein intake was independently negatively associated with ATO and APHV (P &lt; 0.05 each) and tended to be negatively associated with age at menarche/voice break (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: A higher animal protein intake may be involved in an earlier attainment of ATO and APHV, whereas a more intensive adrenarchal process may precipitate a shorter pubertal growth spurt and a notably earlier onset of breast and genital development in girls and boys, respectively.",M2

The gene is expressed in the adrenal cortex and catalyses the hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Two of the patients were mother and daughter; the third had no affected relative; the fourth patient inherited the mutation from her father. Three of the group, including the mother and daughter, had the same pathology, primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease, a disorder known to be caused by inactivating mutations of the PRKAR1A gene. In these cases, the adrenal glands were small and the pathologic change was deep in the cortex in which numerous pigmented micronodules developed. In the remaining patient, the glands were slightly enlarged primarily owing to a diffuse hyperplasia of the superficial cortex that extended into the epi-adrenal fat.",M2
20351116,"Reduction of sympathetic activity via <e>adrenal</e>-targeted GRK2 gene deletion attenuates heart failure progression and improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction.Chronic heart failure (HF) is characterized by sympathetic overactivity and enhanced circulating catecholamines (CAs), which significantly increase HF morbidity and mortality. We recently reported that adrenal G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is up-regulated in chronic HF, leading to enhanced CA release via desensitization/down-regulation of the chromaffin cell alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors that normally inhibit CA secretion. We also showed that adrenal GRK2 inhibition decreases circulating CAs and improves cardiac inotropic reserve and function. Herein, we hypothesized that adrenal-targeted GRK2 gene deletion before the onset of HF might be beneficial by reducing sympathetic activation. To specifically delete GRK2 in the chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland, we crossed PNMTCre mice, expressing Cre recombinase under the chromaffin cell-specific phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) gene promoter, with floxedGRK2 mice. After confirming a significant ( approximately 50%) reduction of adrenal GRK2 mRNA and protein levels, the PNMT-driven GRK2 knock-out (KO) offspring underwent myocardial infarction (MI) to induce HF. At 4 weeks post-MI, plasma levels of both norepinephrine and epinephrine were reduced in PNMT-driven GRK2 KO, compared with control mice, suggesting markedly reduced post-MI sympathetic activation. This translated in PNMT-driven GRK2 KO mice into improved cardiac function and dimensions as well as amelioration of abnormal cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor signaling at 4 weeks post-MI. Thus, adrenal-targeted GRK2 gene KO decreases circulating CAs, leading to improved cardiac function and beta-adrenergic reserve in post-MI HF. GRK2 inhibition in the adrenal gland might represent a novel sympatholytic strategy that can aid in blocking HF progression.",M2

20219855,"Effect of acute and prolonged mineralocorticoid receptor blockade on spontaneous and stimulated hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> axis in humans.CONTEXT: Mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) in the hippocampus display an important role in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, mediating the proactive feedback of glucocorticoids, which maintains the basal HPA activity. The systemic administration of MR antagonists enhances spontaneous and CRH-stimulated ACTH, cortisol, and DHEA secretion, while the effects of chronic treatment with MR antagonists are scanty. Our study was performed in order to clarify this point. DESIGN: ACTH, cortisol, and DHEA levels were studied during the infusion of placebo, canrenoate, a MR antagonist (CAN, 200 mg i.v. bolus at 1600 h followed by 200 mg infused over 4 h), and human CRH (hCRH; 2.0 microg/kg i.v. bolus at 1800 h) before and during the last week of 28-day treatment with CAN (200 mg/day p.o.) in eight young women. RESULTS: Pre-treatment sessions: CAN and hCRH administration increased ACTH, cortisol, and DHEA levels versus placebo (P&lt;0.05). Post-treatment sessions: during placebo infusion, cortisol and DHEA were significantly amplified versus pre-treatment session (P&lt;0.05), while ACTH levels were not modified; CAN infusion, differently from pre-treatment session, was not able to significantly increase ACTH, cortisol, and DHEA levels; ACTH, cortisol, and DHEA responses to hCRH were amplified with respect to pre-treatment session, although statistical significance was obtained for cortisol and DHEA only. CONCLUSIONS: MR blockade by acute CAN administration significantly enhances the HPA activity in the afternoon, during the quiescent phase of the circadian rhythm. At the same period, prolonged treatment with CAN amplifies both spontaneous and CRH-stimulated activities of the HPA axis, while it blunts the HPA responsiveness to a further MR-mediated stimulation.",M2

20193701,"Effects of chronic stress: a comparison between tethered and loose sows.The present study aimed to investigate whether long-lasting, recurrent tethering of sows leads to enduring effects on measures that may be indicative of chronic stress. Sows that had experienced tethering for about 1.5 or 4.5years and age-matched sows kept in a social housing system (loose sows) were compared. Immediately after slaughter, blood samples were taken to measure plasma cortisol levels, and the brain, spleen, and <e>adrenals</e> were dissected and weighed. Gene expression in the frontal cortex and hippocampus was analyzed. Plasma cortisol levels were higher in the tethered sows than in the loose sows. The older, but not the younger, tethered sows had heavier adrenal glands than their loose counterparts. The weight of the spleen was not affected by the housing conditions, but the pituitary gland was lighter in tethered sows than in loose sows. Microarray analyses revealed an increased expression of beta-globin mRNA in the hippocampus and to a lesser extent in the frontal cortex of the older tethered sows, compared with the older loose sows. Taken together, the findings indicate that chronically stressed pigs develop depression-like symptoms. However, it can be questioned whether the pig subjected to repeated, long-term stress can be regarded an animal model of major depression.",M2
20190160,"Total <e>adrenal</e> volume but not testicular adrenal rest tumor volume is associated with hormonal control in patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.CONTEXT: Patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) have been shown to develop adrenal adenomas and, in males, testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs) at a high percentage. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the interrelation of adrenal masses and TARTs as well as factors stimulating tumor growth of orthotopic and ectopic adrenal tissue in 21-OHD. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, 26 adult male patients with classic 21-OHD (15 salt wasting, 11 simple virilizing; age range, 18-48 yr) were clinically assessed according to their hormonal control. Magnetic resonance imaging of the adrenals (26 of 26) and of the testes (18 of 26) was performed. Adrenal size and morphology was compared to 26 age-matched controls. RESULTS: Combined adrenal volume of 21-OHD patients was significantly higher (median, 9.3 ml; range, 3.2-124.5 ml) in comparison to controls (median, 7.4 ml; range, 5.5-10.8 ml; P = 0.005). Morphologically, adrenals were classified as normal without nodules in 27% of 21-OHD patients compared to 69% of controls. None of the controls, but 42% of 21-OHD patients had an overall adrenal volume higher than 11 ml. Ten of 18 patients had TARTs with a median volume of 3.3 ml (range, 0.4-21.6 ml). Total adrenal volume and tumor size but not TART volume correlated positively with current parameters of hormonal control (androstenedione, morning 17-OHP in serum, pregnanetriol in 24-h urine; P &lt; 0.001 for each). Baseline ACTH was independent of adrenal and TART volume. There was no correlation of total adrenal or adrenal tumor size with TART volume. CONCLUSION: These data provide indirect evidence that different factors regulate the growth of orthotopic adrenal tissue and ectopic adrenal remnants in TARTs.",M2
20185764,"Sex differences in the serotonergic influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> stress axis.Appropriate interactions between serotonin (5-HT) and stress pathways are critical for maintaining homeostasis. Dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis is a common feature in affective disorders in which an involvement of 5-HT neurocircuitry has been implicated in disease vulnerability and treatment responsiveness. Because there is a greater prevalence of affective disorders in women, sex differences in the 5-HTergic influence on stress pathways may contribute to disease disparity. Therefore, our studies compared stress or citalopram-induced corticosterone levels in male and female mice. To determine whether sex-dependent HPA axis responsiveness was mediated by the difference in testosterone levels, testosterone-treated females were also examined. Gene expression patterns in 5-HTergic and stress neurocircuitry were analyzed to determine sites of potential sex differences and mechanisms of testosterone action. As expected, restraint stress corticosterone levels were higher in intact females and were masculinized by testosterone. Interestingly, citalopram administration independent of stress resulted in a greater corticosterone response in females, which was also masculinized by testosterone. Analyses along the 5-HT-HPA axis revealed sex differences including greater pituitary 5-HT receptors and adrenal weights in females. Moreover, in stress-regulatory regions, we found sex differences in glucocorticoid receptor and glutamic acid decarboxylase expression supportive of greater inhibitory modulation and feedback potential in males. Taken together, these data suggest that multiple sites related to 5-HTergic stimulation, corticosterone production, and negative feedback of HPA neurocircuitry combine to produce higher female stress responsiveness. These studies support a potential for sex-specific involvement of 5-HT and stress pathways in the etiology of affective disorders.",M2
20184944,"Low dose dexamethasone reverses depressive-like parameters and memory impairment in rats submitted to sepsis.Sepsis is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response of the immune system against an infection, presenting with hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> (HPA) axis dysfunction, behavior alterations, and high mortality. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of dexamethasone on mortality, anhedonia, circulating corticosterone and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) levels, body and adrenal gland weight, and aversive memory in sepsis survivor rats. Male Wistar rats underwent sham operation or cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) procedure. Rats subjected to CLP were treated with  basic support  and dexamethasone (at 0.2 and 2mg/kg daily for 7 days after CLP, intraperitonially) or saline. After 10 days of sepsis procedure, it was evaluated aversive memory, sweet food consumption, and body and adrenal gland weight. Serum and plasma were also obtained. It was observed that low dose dexamethasone reverted anhedonia, normalized adrenal gland and body weight, corticosterone and ACTH levels, and decreased mortality and avoidance memory impairment, demonstrating that low doses of dexamethasone for moderate periods may be beneficial for sepsis treatment and its sequelae-depressive-like parameters and memory impairment.",M2
20181796,"Real-time monitoring of chemical transmission in slices of the murine <e>adrenal</e> gland.The real-time electrochemical detection of catecholamine secretion from murine adrenal slices using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) and amperometry at carbon fiber microelectrodes is described. Bright-field and immunofluorescent microscopy supported that chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla are organized into clusters and positively stain for tyrosine hydroxylase confirming that they are catecholaminergic. Spontaneous exocytotic catecholamine events were observed inside chromaffin cell clusters with both FSCV and amperometry and were modulated by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist hexamethonium and low extracellular calcium. Reintroduction of extracellular calcium and pressure ejection of acetylcholine caused the frequency of spikes to increase back to predrug levels. Electrical stimulation caused the synchronous secretion from multiple cells within the gland, which were modulated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but not muscarinic receptors or gap junctions. Furthermore, electrically stimulated release was abolished with perfusion of low extracellular calcium or tetrodotoxin, indicating that the release requires electrical excitability. An extended waveform was used to study the spontaneous and stimulated release events to determine their chemical content by FSCV. Consistent with total content analysis and immunohistochemical studies, about two thirds of the cells studied spontaneously secreted epinephrine, whereas one third secreted norepinephrine. Whereas adrenergic sites contained mostly epinephrine during electrical stimulation, noradrenergic sites contained a mixture of the catecholamines showing the heterogeneity of the adrenal medulla.",M2
20180248,"Hepatic mucormycosis mimicking hilar cholangiocarcinoma: a case report and literature review.Mucormycosis is a rare but invasive opportunistic fungal infection associated with a high mortality rate, and normally occurs in immunocompromised patients. In this report, we describe an immunocompetent patient suffering from hepatic mucormycosis secondary to <e>adrenal</e> mucormycosis, which masquerades as hilar cholangiocarcinoma. After surgical procedure and treatment with amphotericin B and itraconazole, the patient recovered well and had a 2-year infection-free survival.

Meanwhile, this is the first case of an immunocompetent patient with both adrenal and hepatic mucormycosis who has been treated successfully.",M2
20172968,"Female mice expressing constitutively active mutants of FSH receptor present with a phenotype of premature follicle depletion and estrogen excess.Strong gain-of-function mutations have not been identified in humans in the FSH receptor (FSHR), whereas such mutations are common among many other G protein-coupled receptors. In order to predict consequences of such mutations on humans, we first identified constitutively activated mutants of the mouse (m) Fshr and then expressed them under the human anti-Müllerian hormone promoter in transgenic mice or created knock-in mutation into the mouse genome. We show here that mutations of Asp580 in the mFSHR significantly increase the basal receptor activity. D580H and D580Y mutations of mFSHR bind FSH, but the activity of the former is neither ligand-dependent nor promiscuous towards LH/human choriogonadotropin stimulation. Transgenic expression of mFshr(D580H) in granulosa cells leads to abnormal ovarian structure and function in the form of hemorrhagic cysts, accelerated loss of small follicles, augmented granulosa cell proliferation, increased estradiol biosynthesis, and occasional luteinized unruptured follicles or teratomas. The most affected mFshr(D580H) females are infertile with disturbed estrous cycle and decreased gonadotropin and increased prolactin levels. Increased estradiol and prolactin apparently underlie the enhanced development of the mammary glands, adenomatous pituitary growth, and lipofuscin accumulation in the <e>adrenal</e> gland. The influence of the mFSHR(D580Y) mutation is milder, mainly causing hemorrhagic cysts in transgenic mFSHR(D580Y) and mFSHR(D580Y) -knock-in mice. The results demonstrate that gain-of-function mutations of the FSHR in mice bring about distinct and clear changes in ovarian function, informative in the search of similar mutations in humans.",M2
20172006,"Adrenomedullin 2 attenuates the pressor but not <e>adrenal</e> responses to angiotensin II in conscious sheep.Biological actions attributed to the adrenomedullin (AM) peptides, AM and AM2, include reduction of arterial pressure and peripheral resistance. While AM has been shown to reduce aldosterone secretion from the adrenal, little information is available regarding possible actions of AM2 on aldosterone. Evidence suggests that AM may act as a functional antagonist to angiotensin II (Ang II) but such a role has not been investigated for AM2. Accordingly, we have examined hemodynamic and adrenal responses to stepped Ang II infusions with or without co-infusions of AM2 (33ng/(kgmin)) in conscious sheep under controlled conditions of a low sodium intake. The dose-dependent pressor response (5-50mmHg) of Ang II was both delayed and attenuated (p&lt;0.001) by AM2 which also stimulated heart rate (p&lt;0.001) and cardiac output (p&lt;0.001). AM2 prevented Ang II-induced increases in peripheral resistance (p&lt;0.001). In contrast, plasma aldosterone responses to Ang II were not significantly altered by concomitant AM2 infusion. In conclusion, low dose infusion of AM2 administered to conscious sheep on a low salt diet clearly antagonized the vasopressor action of administered Ang II while stimulating cardiac output and heart rate. In contrast to AM, AM2 had no restraining influence on the aldosterone response to Ang II. The data suggest a possible role for AM2 in cardiovascular homeostasis in part through antagonism of the vasopressor action of Ang II.",M2
20157193,"Cushing syndrome in the McCune-Albright syndrome.CONTEXT: Cushing syndrome (CS) is a rare but potentially fatal feature of McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS). Optimal management, prognostic features, and long-term follow-up of this disorder have not been described. SETTING: The study was conducted at an academic tertiary care center. PATIENTS: A total of 112 patients participating in a natural history study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were evaluated, and 21 published cases were reviewed. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received observation, medical management, or bilateral adrenalectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured prevalence, prognostic factors, and natural history. RESULTS: The prevalence of CS among NIH patients was 7.1%. The median age at diagnosis was 3 months. Clinical features included  Cushingoid facies  (66.7%), failure to thrive (60.0%), low birth weight (50.0%), liver disease (36.7%), and heart disease (26.7%). Six patients (20.0%) died, four after adrenalectomy. Death was more likely in patients with comorbid heart disease (odds ratio, 13.3; P &lt; 0.05). Of 23 survivors, 13 underwent adrenalectomy, and 10 exhibited spontaneous resolution. Two patients with spontaneous resolution who were tested later in life (3 and 15 yr after resolution) continued to have low-level, autonomous <e>adrenal</e> function with biochemical adrenal insufficiency. Compared to MAS patients without CS, patients with CS were more likely to have a cognitive/developmental disorder (44.4 vs. 4.8%; P &lt; 0.001; odds ratio, 8.8). CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid heart and liver disease were poor prognostic markers and may indicate the need for prompt adrenalectomy. The high incidence of cognitive disorders indicates a need for close developmental follow-up and parental counseling. Patients with spontaneous resolution of CS may develop adrenal insufficiency, and they require long-term monitoring.",M2
20156622,"A large single-center experience of EUS-guided FNA of the left and right <e>adrenal</e> glands: diagnostic utility and impact on patient management.BACKGROUND: EUS-guided FNA of the left and right adrenals has been described, but data are very limited. OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to determine the impact of the diagnostic utility of EUS-guided FNA of adrenal glands on patient management. Our secondary objective was to determine predictors of malignant adrenal involvement. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Patients with enlarged adrenal(s) on abdominal imaging underwent EUS-guided FNA. The left adrenal (n = 54) was sampled via the transgastric approach and the right adrenal (n = 5) via a transduodenal approach. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (63% men, median age 65 years) were evaluated. The median adrenal gland size was 25 x 17 mm. Adrenal tissue adequate for interpretation was obtained in all of the patients. EUS-guided FNA confirmed malignancy in 22 (37%) patients. Based on size (&gt; or =30 mm) alone, EUS had an accuracy of 68%. Patients with malignant cytology had higher standard uptake value scores on positron-emission tomography compared with patients with benign adrenal masses (P &lt; .001). Malignant masses were more likely to have an altered adrenal gland shape compared with benign masses (crude odds ratio [OR] 12.0; P &lt; .001). On multivariable analysis, altered adrenal gland shape was a significant predictor of malignancy (adjusted OR 7.94; P = .015), whereas a size of 30 mm or larger (adjusted OR 1.30; P = .774) and hypoechoic nature (adjusted OR 12.05; P = .148) were not. All patients except 2 with malignant cytology were treated with systemic therapy without the need for additional invasive biopsies or surgery. No immediate complications were encountered. LIMITATIONS: Lack of surgical criterion standard; 1 experienced endosonographer. CONCLUSIONS: EUS-guided FNA of the adrenal glands is a minimally invasive and safe approach that documents or excludes malignant involvement. EUS-guided FNA should be the first next test to evaluate enlarged adrenal glands because it directs therapy and affects patient management.",M2
20153424,"Neonatal methamphetamine-induced corticosterone release in rats is inhibited by <e>adrenal</e> autotransplantation without altering the effect of the drug on hippocampal serotonin.Rat neonatal methamphetamine exposure results in corticosterone release and learning and memory impairments in later life; effects also observed after neonatal stress. Previous attempts to test the role of corticosterone release after methamphetamine using corticosterone inhibitors were unsuccessful and adrenalectomy caused reductions in hippocampal serotonin greater than those caused by methamphetamine alone. Here we tested whether adrenal autotransplantation could be used to attenuate methamphetamine-induced corticosterone release without also altering the effects of the drug on serotonin. Adrenal autotransplantation surgery occurred on postnatal day 9 followed by methamphetamine or saline treatment from postnatal day 11-20 (10mg/kg/dosex4/day). Plasma corticosterone and hippocampal serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were determined 30min following the first treatment on each day between postnatal days 11-20. Adrenal autotransplantation attenuated neonatal methamphetamine-induced corticosterone release by approximately 70% initially, approximately 55% midway through treatment, and approximately 25% by the end of treatment. Methamphetamine reduced serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the hippocampus in the ADXA rats to the same degree as in SHAM rats. The data show that neonatal adrenal autotransplantation is an effective method for partially reducing treatment-induced corticosterone release while providing sufficient corticosterone to sustain normal growth and development. The method should be applicable to other models of developmental stress/corticosterone release.",M2
20146381,"The involvement of hypophyseal-gonadal and hypophyseal-<e>adrenal</e> axes in arsenic-mediated ovarian and uterine toxicity: modulation by hCG.This study evaluated the involvement of hypophyseal-gonadal and hypophyseal-adrenal axes as a possible mechanism of sodium arsenite toxicity in ovary and uterus by the coadministration of hCG. Subchronic treatment of 0.4 ppm of sodium arsenite/(100 g body weight day) via drinking water for seven estrous cycles significantly suppressed the plasma levels of leutinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol along with sluggish ovarian activities of Delta(5),3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase followed by a reduction in gonadal tissue peroxidase activities in mature female rats at diestrous phase. Noticeable weight loss of the ovary and uterus along with prolonged diestrous phase and increased deposition of arsenic in the plasma and in these reproductive organs were also demonstrated following the ingestion of arsenic. Follicular atresia and thinning of the uterine luminal diameter were evident after sodium arsenite treatment. Effective protection of gonadal weight loss, suppressed ovarian steroidogenesis, and altered ovarian and uterine peroxidase activities were noticed when 1.0 IU hCG/(100 g body weight day) is given in arsenic-intoxicated rats. Normal estrous cyclicity was restored toward the control level after hCG coadministration, though the elimination of elementary arsenic from the plasma and gonadal tissues was impossible. A significant recovery in the restoration of ovarian and uterine histoarchitecture was prominent after hCG treatment. Adrenal hypertrophy and steroidogenic arrest of the adrenal gland along with altered level of brain monoamines in the midbrain and diencephalons following arsenic intoxication were also ameliorated after hCG coadministration.",M2

Functional changes in the different components of the HHACS were detected using standard tests with i.p. ACTH or hydrocortisone on the background of cold stress and injections of Poly I:C. Single doses of Poly I:C were followed by the development of impairments to HHACS function, with decreases in the ACTH sensitivity of <e>adrenal</e> cells and suppression of the negative feedback mechanism, resulting in significant decreases in corticosterone concentrations in standard tests with administration of ACTH and hydrocortisone.",M2
20144979,"Developmental programming of adult <e>adrenal</e> structure and steroidogenesis: effects of fetal glucocorticoid excess and postnatal dietary omega-3 fatty acids.Fetal glucocorticoid excess programs a range of detrimental outcomes in the adult phenotype, at least some of which may be due to altered adult adrenocortical function. In this study, we determined the effects of maternal dexamethasone treatment on offspring adrenal morphology and function, as well as the interactive effects of postnatal dietary omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids. This postnatal dietary intervention has been shown to alleviate many of the programming outcomes in this model, but whether this is via the effects on adrenal function is unknown. Dexamethasone acetate was administered to pregnant rats (0.75 microg/ml drinking water) from day 13 to term. Cross-fostered offspring were raised on either a standard or high-n-3 diet. Adrenal weight (relative to body weight) at 6 months of age was unaffected by prenatal dexamethasone, regardless of postnatal diet, and stereological analysis showed no effect of dexamethasone on the volumes of adrenal components (zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata/reticularis or adrenal medulla). Expression of key steroidogenic genes (Cyp11a1 and Star) was unaffected by either prenatal dexamethasone or postnatal diet. In contrast, adrenal expression of Mc2r mRNA, which encodes the ACTH receptor, was higher in offspring of dexamethasone-treated mothers, an effect partially attenuated by the Hn3 diet. Moreover, stress-induced levels of plasma and urinary corticosterone and urinary aldosterone were elevated in offspring of dexamethasone-treated mothers, indicative of enhanced adrenal responsiveness. In conclusion, this study shows that prenatal exposure to dexamethasone does not increase basal adrenocortical activity but does result in a more stress-responsive adrenal phenotype, possibly via increased Mc2r expression.",M2
20144629,"Homologous posttranscriptional regulation of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor level via glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and mammalian target of rapamycin in <e>adrenal</e> chromaffin cells: effect on tau phosphorylation.In cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, approximately 24 h-treatment with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) decreased cell surface (125)I-IGF-I binding capacity and IGF-I receptor protein level by approximately 64% (EC(50) = 5.0 nM; t(1/2) = approximately 7 h). IGF-I-induced IGF-I receptor decrease was abolished by LY294002 (phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor) and partially attenuated by rapamycin (an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR]). SB216763 (an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 [GSK-3]) down-regulated IGF-I receptor, which was further decreased by IGF-I. IGF-I increased inhibitory Ser(9)-phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and stimulatory Ser(2448)-phosphorylation of mTOR. l-leucine increased phosphorylation of mTOR (but not GSK-3beta), and down-regulated IGF-I receptor, both events being abolished by rapamycin. IGF-I-induced IGF-I receptor decrease was not prevented by proteolysis inhibitors. Pulse-label with [(35)S]methionine/cysteine followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that SB216763 or L-leucine retarded synthesis of IGF-I receptor and its precursor molecule. SB216763 (but not l-leucine) destabilized IGF-I receptor mRNA and decreased its level, without changing IGF-I receptor gene transcription. In SB216763-treated cells, IGF-I-induced Tyr-autophosphorylation of IGF-I receptor was decreased by 36%, compared to nontreated cells. IGF-I attenuated constitutive Ser(396)-phosphorylation of tau by 30% in nontreated cells, but not in SB216763-treated cells. IGF-I-induced down-regulations of (125)I-IGF-I binding and IGF-I receptor, as well as IGF-I-induced phosphorylations of GSK-3beta and mTOR were restored to the control levels of nontreated cells after washout of IGF-I (10 nM for 12 h)-treated cells. Thus, IGF-I down-regulated functional IGF-I receptor via GSK-3beta inhibition and mTOR activation; constitutive activity of GSK-3beta maintained IGF-I receptor level in nonstimulated cells.",M2
20134197,"Role of toll-like receptors and inflammation in <e>adrenal</e> gland insufficiency.Adrenal gland insufficiency - the clinical manifestation of deficient production or action of adrenal steroids - is a life-threatening disorder. Among many factors which can predispose to primary adrenal failure, an autoimmune adrenalitis and infectious agents play a major role. The initial host defense against bacterial infections is executed primarily by the pattern recognition receptors, e.g. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), expressed in cells from the innate immune system. Upon activation, TLRs have been found to regulate various levels of innate and adaptive immunity as well as control tissue inflammation. TLRs are implicated in adrenal cell turnover and steroidogenesis during inflammation. Therefore, TLRs play a crucial role in the activation of adrenal inflammation mediating adrenal gland dysfunction during septicemia.",M2
20133384,"Role of bone morphogenetic proteins in <e>adrenal</e> physiology and disease.Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily of ligands that impact on a multitude of biological processes including cell type specification, differentiation and organogenesis. Furthermore, a large body of evidence points towards important BMP-dependent mechanisms in tumorigenesis. In accordance with their diverse actions, BMPs have been demonstrated to serve as auto-, para- and endocrine modulators also in a number of hormonal systems. In this review, we highlight novel aspects of BMP-dependent regulatory networks that pertain to adrenal physiology and disease, which have been uncovered during recent years. These aspects include the role of BMP-dependent mechanism during adrenal development, modulating effects on catecholamine synthesis and steroidogenesis and dysregulation of BMP signalling in adrenal tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we summarize potential therapeutic approaches that are based on reconstitution of BMP signalling in adrenocortical tumour cells.",M2
20132880,"Potential estrogenic effect(s) of parabens at the prepubertal stage of a postnatal female rat model.In this study, a female pubertal assay on the effects of parabens, including methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, isopropyl-, butyl-, and isobutylparaben, was performed in a female Sprague-Dawley rat model during the juvenile-peripubertal period. The rats were orally treated with these parabens from postnatal day 21-40 in a dose-dependent manner (62.5, 250 and 1000 mg/kg body weight [BW]/day). 17alpha-Ethinylestradiol (1mg/kg BW/day) was used as a positive control and corn oil as a vehicle. A high dose of methyl- and isopropylparaben (1000 mg/kg BW/day) resulted in a significant delay in the date of vaginal opening and a decrease in length of the estrous cycle. In measurements of organ weight and body weight, we observed significant weight changes in ovaries, <e>adrenal</e> glands, thyroid glands, liver, and kidneys; conversely, body weight was not altered following paraben treatment. The potential effects of parabens on estrogenicity were shown in histopathological abnormities in the reproductive organs. Histological analysis of the ovaries from the peripubertal rats revealed a decrease of corpora lutea, increase in the number of cystic follicles, and thinning of the follicular epithelium. In addition, morphological studies of the uterus revealed the myometrial hypertrophy by a high dose of propyl- and isopropylparaben (1000 mg/kg-day), and in all dose groups of butyl- and isobutylparabens. However, no significant histopathological changes were observed in the other organs (i.e. adrenal and thyroid glands). We also observed a significant decrease in serum estradiol and thyroxine concentrations in methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, isopropyl-, and isobutylparaben-treated groups. A receptor-binding assay indicated that the relative binding affinities of parabens to estrogen receptors occurred in the order: isobutylparaben&gt;butylparaben&gt;isopropylparaben=propylparaben&gt;ethylparaben. These values were much lower than the binding affinity for 17beta-estradiol. Taken together, long-term exposure to parabens, which show less estrogenic activity than estradiol, can produce suppressive effects on hormonal responsiveness and can disrupt the morphology of reproductive target tissues. In addition, the relation between thyroid weight and thyroid hormone may influence circulating levels of parabens, suggesting the effects of parabens as thyrotoxic during this critical stage of development in female rats.",M2
20124107,"Impact of different diagnostic criteria during <e>adrenal</e> vein sampling on reproducibility of subtype diagnosis in patients with primary aldosteronism.In patients with primary aldosteronism, adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is considered the only reliable technique to distinguish between unilateral and bilateral autonomous production of aldosterone, but agreement is lacking on the best criteria indicating successful cannulation and lateralization. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of differing criteria for the successful cannulation and lateralization on the reproducibility of subtype diagnosis. Sixty-two patients with confirmed primary aldosteronism underwent AVS on 2 separate occasions, because the first was unsatisfactory. We compared the different diagnoses of primary aldosteronism subtype reached using AVS data assessed by permissive (type 1), intermediate (type 2), and strict (type 3) criteria. Although 91.1% of all of the (both first and second) AVSs were  successful  by type 1 criteria (50.8% by type 2 and 33.9% by type 3), in only 35.3% of patients was the diagnosis concordant between the first and second AVS. Type 1 criteria also led to a higher rate of diagnosis of unilateral primary aldosteronism (67.3% of successful procedures) than type 2 (36.5%) or type 3 (26.2%). There was considerable disparity in the diagnosis reached using the 3 different criteria, with concordance in only 32.2%. Using either type 1 or 2 criteria, the minimal adrenal/peripheral vein cortisol ratio necessary to obtain the same diagnosis in the first and second AVS procedures was &gt;/=2.75. In conclusion, permissive criteria for successful cannulation and lateralization on AVS achieve poor diagnostic reproducibility and should be avoided.",M2
20123619,"Computational model of steroidogenesis in human H295R cells to predict biochemical response to endocrine-active chemicals: model development for metyrapone.BACKGROUND: An in vitro steroidogenesis assay using the human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line H295R is being evaluated as a possible screening assay to detect and assess the impact of endocrine-active chemicals (EACs) capable of altering steroid biosynthesis. Data interpretation and their quantitative use in human and ecological risk assessments can be enhanced with mechanistic computational models to help define mechanisms of action and improve understanding of intracellular concentration-response behavior. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to develop a mechanistic computational model of the metabolic network of <e>adrenal</e> steroidogenesis to estimate the synthesis and secretion of adrenal steroids in human H295R cells and their biochemical response to steroidogenesis-disrupting EAC. METHODS: We developed a deterministic model that describes the biosynthetic pathways for the conversion of cholesterol to adrenal steroids and the kinetics for enzyme inhibition by metryrapone (MET), a model EAC. Using a nonlinear parameter estimation method, the model was fitted to the measurements from an in vitro steroidogenesis assay using H295R cells. RESULTS: Model-predicted steroid concentrations in cells and culture medium corresponded well to the time-course measurements from control and MET-exposed cells. A sensitivity analysis indicated the parameter uncertainties and identified transport and metabolic processes that most influenced the concentrations of primary adrenal steroids, aldosterone and cortisol. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using a computational model of steroidogenesis to estimate steroid concentrations in vitro. This capability could be useful to help define mechanisms of action for poorly characterized chemicals and mixtures in support of predictive hazard and risk assessments with EACs.",M2

Histologically, this mass was composed of a dense proliferation of spindle cells with a fibrosarcomatous-like pattern. Immunohistochemistry using anticytokeratin showed some epithelial cells within the tumor. The diagnosis of primitive synovial sarcoma of the left adrenal fossa was confirmed by the presence of the characteristic t(X;18) translocation.

20110188,"Autopsy case of a patient with 13q- syndrome.Partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13 results in 13q(-) syndrome, and phenotypes of affected patients vary widely. We describe an autopsy case of the sudden, unexpected death of a 17-year-old boy with 13q(-) syndrome. He had severe psychomotor retardation and had been receiving follow-up care. One day he was found dead in his house and autopsy was performed to elucidate the cause of death. Autopsy findings revealed lobulation anomalies of the lungs, hypoplasia of the <e>adrenal</e> and thyroid glands, and apituitarism due to hyperplasia of bone in the hypophyseal fossa. No other pathological lesions were observed. Chromosomal analysis confirmed interstitial deletion from the long arm of chromosome 13. Karyotype was 46,XY, del(13)(q14.3q32). We concluded that the patient died of multi-organ dysfunction due to apituitarism. Autopsy cases of 13q(-) syndrome are rare. Furthermore, lobulation anomalies and apituitarism associated with 13q(-) syndrome have not previously been described. This case report offers novel clues to elucidating critical regions of chromosome 13 associated with malformations of the lungs and pituitary gland.",M2

Infants and METHODS: Sixty-six neonates divided into two groups: betamethasone group, whose mothers received betamethasone 12 mg two times 24 h apart, and no betamethasone group, whose mothers did not receive any steroid agent during the antenatal period. Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) levels and cortisol levels were measured during the first six hours of life. In addition, adrenal gland length and width were determined on the first day of life. Hormone tests and ultrasonographic evaluation were repeated on the fifth day of life. RESULTS: We found statistically significant reductions in 17-OHP and cortisol levels at birth in corticosteroid-exposed neonates (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between the study groups with regard to adrenal gland length and width (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that betamethasone use in preterm neonates reduces endogenous 17-OHP and cortisol levels; however, it has no effect on adrenal gland size.",M2
20092183,"[Analysis of causes contributing to inefficiency of roentgenoendovascular destruction of <e>adrenal</e> glands in hypertensive patients]The study was aimed at bettering therapeutic outcomes for patients suffering from adrenal-aetiology arterial hypertension, with the objective deemed attainable at the expense of revealing and removing the underlying causes potentially contributing to unfavourable results obtained after roentgenoendovascular ablation of the adrenal glands. We retrospectively examined the medical records of 49 patients having undergone hospital treatment within the time frame from 1992 to 2007 for recurrent arterial hypertension poorly controlled by previously endured roentgenoendovascular (REV) interventions. The identified causes contributing heavily to poor clinical outcomes obtained after the REV-ablation procedures appeared to have been as follows: renal parenchymatous diseases in 20 patients having a long history of arterial hypertension with evidence ofnephroangiosclerosis; insufficient devitalisation of the adrenal glands in a further 19 patients; a pheochromocytoma of the right adrenal gland in only one instance; and newly onset renovascular hypertension in the remaining nine subjects. It was determined that poor therapeutic outcomes had primarily been caused by overestimating the indications for performing REV ablation of the adrenal glands, being seemingly wanton as a corrective measure to have been taken in the presence of inflammatory diseases of the renal parenchyma and secondary hyperplasia of the adrenal gland, with the second-in-order contributory cause appearing to be insufficient devitalisation of the adrenal glands afflicted by hyperplasia and/or aldosteroma. The development of renal artery stenosis in the remote period after REV interventions may also be responsible for a relapse of arterial hypertension, which is quite often the case.",M2
20090023,"Fuel oil-induced <e>adrenal</e> hypertrophy in ranch mink (Mustela vison): effects of sex, fuel oil weathering, and response to adrenocorticotropic hormone.Environmental contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons from anthropogenic sources can be a cause of stress for free-ranging wildlife. The response of wildlife to chemical contaminants requires that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis be precisely regulated to allow for proper glucocorticoid-mediated adaptive responses. Chronic oral exposure to low concentrations of bunker C fuel oil causes the development of adrenal hypertrophy in male ranch mink (Mustela vison) without increasing serum or fecal glucocorticoid concentrations. This hypertrophy is an adaptive response to fuel oil-induced adrenal insufficiency. To determine if the same phenomenon occurs in female mink or male mink exposed to artificially weathered fuel oil, female mink were fed 0 ppm (mineral oil) or 420 ppm fuel oil and male mink were exposed to 0 ppm, 420 ppm fuel oil, or 480 ppm artificially weathered fuel oil in the diet for 60-62 days. At the end of the exposure, serum glucocorticoid concentrations were assayed along with body and organ weight measurements. Fecal glucocorticoid concentrations were assayed at time points throughout the exposure. Male mink fed fuel oil or weathered fuel oil and female mink fed fuel oil had adrenal enlargement without any significant increases in the serum or fecal concentration of glucocorticoids, which is consistent with fuel oil-induced adrenal insufficiency. To address the physiological consequences of adrenal insufficiency, fuel oil-exposed male mink were administered an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Fuel oil-exposed animals had a smaller incremental increase in serum glucocorticoid concentration after ACTH challenge compared to control animals. Our findings provide further evidence that the HPA axis of fuel oil-exposed animals is compromised and, therefore, not able to respond appropriately to the diverse stressors found in the environment.",M2
20088645,"A pilot study to assess the feasibility of measurement of <e>adrenal</e> gland volume by magnetic resonance imaging.BACKGROUND: Repeated computed tomography (CT) assessment of the adrenal glands is associated with a significant radiation burden. The increasing capabilities of magnetic resonance (MR) volumetric analysis of the adrenals make this a potentially alternative technique in man. PURPOSE: To determine whether MR imaging could be used to measure adrenal volume, and to determine the intra- and interobserver variation and repeatability of MR volume imaging of adrenals in healthy human subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a single-cohort, sequential design, three-part study involving four MRI examinations per subject following ethical approval and informed consent. Information was collected on four healthy subjects (three male and one female). Two different investigators estimated the area of the adrenal gland for each of the 3-mm contiguous slices (and consequently adrenal volume). In order to estimate inter- and intrareader variability, a repeated-measures mixed model was fitted with adrenal volume as the dependent variable. In order to estimate any bias between readers, Bland-Altman methodology was applied. RESULTS: Intraobserver variation for adrenal gland volume is approximately 5% of a 3-cm(3 )adrenal gland. Interobserver variation is approximately 9% of a 3-cm(3) adrenal gland. Potential variation in measurement for adrenal volume from all sources equates to approximately 14% of a 3-cm(3) adrenal gland. Verification of image reading by a second investigator (consensus reading) reduces variability. CONCLUSION: Analysis of adrenal gland volume using MRI is a potentially reliable technique that could be used to assess a pathological change in adrenal size.",M2
20029233,"Noonan syndrome: the hypothalamo-<e>adrenal</e> and hypothalamo-gonadal axes.The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis has not been studied systematically in Noonan syndrome (NS), despite potential concerns about other aspects of hypothalamo-pituitary function. While adrenarche may be delayed in children with constitutional growth of puberty and in isolated GH deficiency, this does not generally seem to be the case in hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism due to Turner syndrome (TS) and this is (anecdotally) the usual hormonal profile in NS children and adults. Precocious or 'exaggerated' adrenarche can be associated with intrauterine growth retardation and is a forerunner of syndrome X. Although NS neonates often have 'normal' birth weights, in some it can be artificially inflated by subcutaneous edema (as in TS, where intrauterine growth retardation is characteristic). Overall, however, a controlling role for adrenarche (whether precocious or delayed) in gonadarche in NS seems unlikely. Neither normally descended testes nor normal (even if delayed) pubertal development implies normal fertility in NS men. Interactions between fetal, neonatal, childhood and pubertal testis development and gonadal axis maturation are complex. There is probably a spectrum of abnormalities in NS, but most commonly primary gonadal failure and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism - characteristic NS molecular genetic abnormalities - may be important for normal germ cell proliferation, development and migration. The identification of different gene defects facilitates understanding of NS phenotypic diversity and provides opportunities for prospective studies on gonadal and adrenal axes in better defined populations less subject to ascertainment bias. At a clinical level, more longitudinal data are still needed with regard to the natural history of pubertal timing, its tempo of progression and the pattern of pubertal growth.",M2

20047506,"Ketoconazole enantiomer for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.The impact of hypercortisolism on multiple metabolic conditions is well recognized; the metabolic manifestations of Cushing's syndrome overlap with those seen in type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Ketoconazole (KTZ), a widely used antifungal agent that inhibits various enzymes in <e>adrenal</e> cortisol synthesis, is effective in treating hypercortisolemia, but its use is limited by toxicities. KTZ is a racemic compound of two cis-enantiomers: (2R,4S)-(+)-KTZ and (2S,4R)-(-)-KTZ. The consideration of an enantiomer with selective effect but minimal metabolic toxicity has driven the development of DIO-902 ([2S,4R]-[-]-KTZ) for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. To evaluate the safety profile and effect of KTZ enantiomer, (2S,4R)-(-)-KTZ, on cortisol production, glycemia, and lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes. Review of multiple published studies and examination of preliminary results from a Phase IIb clinical trial. Twelve weeks of treatment with DIO-902 resulted in reduced levels of HbA1c, FPG, total and LDL cholesterol as well as weight loss and decreased BP. In a previously conducted Phase IIa study, C-reactive protein levels decreased with DIO-902 treatment. Unfortunately, the development of this agent has been terminated due to unacceptable safety profiles.",M2

A MDCT showed a 2.7 low-attenuating nodule in segment VII of the liver through all CT phases. Compared to a precontrast image, however, a subtle enhancement was noted on the arterial phase CT image. On T1 weighted in- and opposed-phase MR images, an abundant fat component within the lesion was seen. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR images after administration of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) more clearly depicted hypervascularity and wash-out of the lesion on arterial and portal phases, respectively. On delayed hepatobiliary phase MR images, obtained 20 minutes after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration, subtle uptake or retention of the contrast agent by the lesion was suspected. A tumorectomy was performed and adrenal adenoma from an ectopic adrenal gland within the liver was confirmed.",M2

We analysed the SPX gene and its protein product in the rat adrenal gland to ascertain whether SPX is involved in the regulation of corticosteroid secretion of and growth of adrenocortical cells. In adult rat adrenal glands the highest levels of SPX mRNA were present in the glomerulosa (ZG) and fasciculate/reticularis (ZF/R) zones. High SPX gene expression levels were found in freshly isolated adult rat ZG and ZF/R cells. In cultured adrenocortical cells the levels of SPX mRNA were lower than in freshly isolated cells. SPX mRNA expression levels were found to be 2-3 times higher during days 90-540 of postnatal development than found during days 2-45. Prolonged ACTH administration lowered and dexamethasone increased adrenal SPX mRNA levels in vivo. Adrenal enucleation produced a significant linear increase in SPX mRNA levels, with the highest value occurring at day 8 after surgery, with control values taken on day 30 after enucleation. Immunohistochemistry revealed SPX-like immunoreactivity in the entire cortex of the adult male rat and in enucleation-induced regenerating cortex. A concentration of 10-6M SPX peptide stimulated basal aldosterone secretion by freshly isolated ZG. In prolonged exposure of adrenocortical cell primary cultures to SPX (10-6M) resulted in a small increase in corticosterone secretion and a notable decrease in BrdU incorporation. The results suggest the direct involvement of SPX in the regulation of adrenocortical cell proliferation; however, the mechanism of action remains unknown.",M2
20041369,"[The difficulties in differential diagnosis of primary aldosteronism subtypes in women with strokes at a young age]In patients with primary aldosteronism (PA), it is fundamental to distinguish between subtypes that benefit from different treatment. The authors describe difficulties in differential diagnosis in a case of 46 year old women with PA and two strokes in the past. Based on high plasma and urine aldosterone concentration, low plasma renin activity (PRA), very high aldosterone/PRA ratio and unilateral macroadenoma detected in computed tomography, aldosterone producing adenoma was diagnosed and the patient was performed unilateral adrenalectomy. Despite the surgical treatment the patient still presented with clinical and biochemical PA symptoms. Moreover, histological examination suggested <e>adrenal</e> hyperplasia, and laboratory tests were typical for glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism.

20038752,"Adrenic acid metabolites as endogenous endothelium-derived and zona glomerulosa-derived hyperpolarizing factors.Adrenic acid (docosatetraenoic acid), an abundant fatty acid in the <e>adrenal</e> gland, is identical to arachidonic acid except for 2 additional carbons on the carboxyl end. Adrenic acid is metabolized by cyclooxygenases, cytochrome P450s, and lipoxygenases; however, little is known regarding the role of adrenic acid and its metabolites in vascular tone. Because of its abundance in the adrenal gland, we investigated the role of adrenic acid in vascular tone of bovine adrenal cortical arteries and its metabolism by bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa cells. In adrenal cortical arteries, adrenic acid caused concentration-dependent relaxations, which were inhibited by the epoxyeicosatrienoic acid antagonist 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid and the cytochrome P450 inhibitor SKF-525A. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel blocker iberiotoxin or removal of the endothelium abolished these relaxations. Reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry isolated and identified numerous adrenic acid metabolites from zona glomerulosa cells, including dihomo-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and dihomo-prostaglandins. In denuded adrenal cortical arteries, adrenic acid caused concentration-dependent relaxations in the presence of zona glomerulosa cells but not in their absence. These relaxations were inhibited by SKF-525A, 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid, and iberiotoxin. Dihomo-16,17-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid caused concentration-dependent relaxations of adrenal cortical arteries, which were inhibited by 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid and high potassium. Our results suggest that adrenic acid relaxations of bovine adrenal cortical arteries are mediated by endothelial and zona glomerulosa cell cytochrome P450 metabolites. Thus, adrenic acid metabolites could function as endogenous endothelium-derived and zona glomerulosa-derived hyperpolarizing factors in the adrenal cortex and contribute to the regulation of adrenal blood flow.",M2

20026095,"Chronic ingestion of 2-deoxy-D-glucose induces cardiac vacuolization and increases mortality in rats.Calorie restriction (CR), the purposeful reduction of energy intake with maintenance of adequate micronutrient intake, is well known to extend the lifespan of laboratory animals. Compounds like 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) that can recapitulate the metabolic effects of CR are of great interest for their potential to extend lifespan. 2DG treatment has been shown to have potential therapeutic benefits for treating cancer and seizures. 2DG has also recapitulated some hallmarks of the CR phenotype including reduced body temperature and circulating insulin in short-term rodent trials, but one chronic feeding study in rats found toxic effects. The present studies were performed to further explore the long-term effects of 2DG in vivo. First we demonstrate that 2DG increases mortality of male Fischer-344 rats. Increased incidence of pheochromocytoma in the <e>adrenal</e> medulla was also noted in the 2DG treated rats. We reconfirm the cardiotoxicity of 2DG in a 6-week follow-up study evaluating male Brown Norway rats and a natural form of 2DG in addition to again examining effects in Fischer-344 rats and the original synthetic 2DG. High levels of both 2DG sources reduced weight gain secondary to reduced food intake in both strains. Histopathological analysis of the hearts revealed increasing vacuolization of cardiac myocytes with dose, and tissue staining revealed the vacuoles were free of both glycogen and lipid. We did, however, observe higher expression of both cathepsin D and LC3 in the hearts of 2DG-treated rats which indicates an increase in autophagic flux. Although a remarkable CR-like phenotype can be reproduced with 2DG treatment, the ultimate toxicity of 2DG seriously challenges 2DG as a potential CR mimetic in mammals and also raises concerns about other therapeutic applications of the compound.",M2

Hyponatremic myelinolysis is a relatively rare, life threatening complication with poorly understood pathophysiology, varied clinical manifestations and uncertain treatment. This case report highlights the range of clinical and imaging phenomena associated with hyponatremic myelinolysis. METHODS: Case report. RESULT: A middle aged lady presented with an acute delirious state, hypotension and severe hyponatremia on a background of skin hyper-pigmentation and weight loss. Her clinical course evolved to an akinetic-rigid state and later to parkinsonism. Extensive investigations for recognizing a primary neurologic disorder, including brain MRI and CSF analysis were normal, though she had disseminated miliary tuberculosis involving multiple organs. Brain MRI changes characteristic of extrapontine myelinolysis appeared two weeks after the onset of symptoms. The patient recovered completely over several weeks. CONCLUSION: This case of hyponatremic extrapontine myelinolysis occurred as the presenting manifestation of adrenal failure secondary to disseminated tuberculosis. Extraponine myelinolysis is difficult to diagnose in the context of delayed brain MRI changes and can have a favorable outcome with modern management.",M2
20021565,"Ethanol induction of steroidogenesis in rat <e>adrenal</e> and brain is dependent upon pituitary ACTH release and de novo adrenal StAR synthesis.The mechanisms of ethanol actions that produce its behavioral sequelae involve the synthesis of potent GABAergic neuroactive steroids, specifically the GABAergic metabolites of progesterone, (3alpha,5alpha)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP), and deoxycorticosterone, (3alpha,5alpha)-3,21-dihydroxypregnan-20-one. We investigated the mechanisms that underlie the effect of ethanol on adrenal steroidogenesis. We found that ethanol effects on plasma pregnenolone, progesterone, 3alpha,5alpha-THP and cortical 3alpha,5alpha-THP are highly correlated, exhibit a threshold of 1.5 g/kg, but show no dose dependence. Ethanol increases plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), adrenal steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and adrenal StAR phosphorylation, but does not alter levels of other adrenal cholesterol transporters. The inhibition of ACTH release, de novo adrenal StAR synthesis or cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage activity prevents ethanol-induced increases in GABAergic steroids in plasma and brain. ACTH release and de novo StAR synthesis are independently regulated following ethanol administration and both are necessary, but not sufficient, for ethanol-induced elevation of plasma and brain neuroactive steroids. As GABAergic steroids contribute to ethanol actions and ethanol sensitivity, the mechanisms of this effect of ethanol may be important factors that contribute to the behavioral actions of ethanol and risk for alcohol abuse disorders.",M2
20021365,"Hormones in the mentally disturbed brain: steroids and peptides in the development and treatment of psychopathology.One of the more fascinating recent discoveries in neuroscience is the widespread influence of hormones on brain regions and functions underlying pathological behaviors. A story is unfolding that points to critical roles played by hypothalamic - pituitary - gonadal (HPG) and hypothalamic - pituitary - <e>adrenal</e> (HPA) axes on a startling array of mental disorders, from depression to dementia. The influence of peptides and steroids does not end with hormones released from the two axes, however. It is now clear that the brain has adapted,  highjacked  is more descriptive, HPG and HPA hormones for uses unrelated to their original functions in reproduction and responses to stress. Findings of neuromodulatory effects of HPA and HPG hormones on monoamine, GABA, glutamate and opioid pathways and of hormone receptors and enzymes involved in hormone synthesis, particularly of steroids, in the hippocampus, amygdala and other subcortical brain regions provide the brain with multiple evolutionary means to adapt to new functions. The complexity of the metabolic cascade for the steroids also leaves open mechanisms by which endogenous errors and exogenous chemicals could be involved in the etiology of psychopathologies. The planned review will examine the recent literature for evidence of steroidal and peptidergic influences on basic biological functions and on mood disorders, anxiety and PTSD, schizophrenia, substance abuse and dementia. Emphasis will be placed on animal models, although findings with patient populations will be prominently included. Special attention will be paid to novel pathways by which the precursors and metabolites of sex steroids can influence psychopathologies. We also will speculate on promising treatments with hormone modulators that may be useful in mollifying the symptomology of the mental disorders.",M2
20016376,"Defining normal <e>adrenal</e> function testing in the intensive care unit setting: a canine study.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intensive care medicine therapies and testing influence hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal test results. It is routine in intensive care medicine to measure hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function, commonly utilizing the adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test to diagnose absolute or relative adrenal insufficiency. DESIGN: Prospective, 96-hr animal study. SETTING: Research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Twenty-four healthy canines. INTERVENTIONS: Animals were randomized into two groups--awake and unrestrained or treated with intensive care medicine therapies, including sedation, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Animals were further randomized to receive dexamethasone (or placebo) or undergo either a total of four or seven adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation tests over 96 hrs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sedation, intubation, and mechanical ventilation transiently increased both basal and postadrenocorticotropic hormone total and free cortisol concentrations &gt;2-fold as compared with baseline for the first 24 hrs (p &lt; or = .05 for both). Performance of seven stimulation tests increased both basal and postadrenocorticotropic hormone total and free cortisol concentrations from baseline by &gt;1.5-fold for the duration of the 96-hr study (p &lt; or = .05). Neither sedation, intubation, and mechanical ventilation nor the performance of more stimulation tests affected delta cortisol measurements (total or free cortisol, p = NS). In contrast, dexamethasone suppressed basal total cortisol concentrations by &gt;2-fold (p &lt; or = .005) at all time points and transiently increased delta total cortisol by approximately 35% during the first 24 hrs of the study (p &lt; or = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Total and free cortisol measurements--whether pre- or post- adrenocorticotropic hormone or as a calculated delta--were altered by intensive care therapies or frequent adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing with one exception. Delta free cortisol was the only hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal measurement unaffected by sedation, intubation, and mechanical ventilation, completion of more adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation tests, or dexamethasone therapy. These findings support the need to determine normal ranges for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal testing in subjects receiving intensive care medicine before establishing laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of relative adrenal insufficiency.",M2
19996571,"Effects of adrenalectomy on neuronal substrate fuel transporter and energy transducer gene expression in hypothalamic and hindbrain metabolic monitoring sites.It has been reported that adrenalectomy (ADX) and the potent type II glucocorticoid receptor agonist, dexamethasone, exert opposing effects on glucose utilization in specific brain regions, including the hypothalamus. The present study investigated the hypothesis that ADX alters neuronal substrate fuel transporter mRNA levels in characterized hypothalamic and hindbrain metabolic monitoring structures, and adjustments in these gene profiles are correlated with modified transcription of genes encoding the glucose sensor, glucokinase (GCK), and the energy-dependent, inwardly-rectifying potassium channel, K(ATP). The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN), and dorsal vagal complex (DVC) were microdissected from ADX and sham-operated male rats 2 h after neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin or vehicle injection, and evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR for neuronal glucose (GLUT3, GLUT4), monocarboxylate (MCT2) transporter, GCK, and sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) mRNA content. ADX modified basal fuel transporter and energy transducer gene expression in a site-specific manner since this manipulation decreased MCT2 and GLUT3 transcription in the DVC only; increased or decreased GCK mRNA in the LHA and VMN, respectively; and decreased SUR1 gene profiles in the DVC and LHA. <e>Adrenal</e> removal did not alter baseline GLUT4 mRNA in any structure examined. ADX also prevented the following transcriptional responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia: downregulated DVC MCT2, downregulated DVC and upregulated LHA and VMN GLUT3, upregulated LHA GLUT4, upregulated LHA GCK, and upregulated VMN SUR1. These results show that the adrenals regulate basal GLUT3 gene profiles in the DVC alone; during hypoglycemia, these glands suppress (DVC) or increase GLUT3 (LHA and VMH) mRNA, and selectively elevate GLUT4 transcripts in the LHA. The data demonstrate divergent adrenal control of DVC neuronal monocarboxylate transporter gene expression under basal (stimulatory) versus hypoglycemic (inhibitory) conditions. The current work also reveals contrasting adrenal regulation of baseline GCK mRNA in the LHA (inhibitory) and VMN (stimulatory), as well as adrenal-dependent hypoglycemic enhancement of LHA GCK and VMN SUR1 gene profiles. Additional research is required to characterize the impact of adrenal-sensitive substrate transporter and metabolic transducer function on fuel uptake and metabolic regulatory signaling in these brain sites.",M2

19962370,"Maternal and genetic factors in stress-resilient and -vulnerable rats: a cross-fostering study.Early environmental factors can modulate the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> (HPA) axis response to stress, together with subsequent brain functions and emotional behaviors. Two rat strains, Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Fischer 344 (F344), are known to exhibit differences in HPA axis reactivity and anxiety behavior in response to restraint stress in adulthood. To investigate the contribution of maternal influences in determining HPA axis and behavioral responses to stress, a cross-fostering study was performed using stress-resilient (SD) or stress-susceptible (F344) strains. We found that SD rats adopted by either an SD (in-fostered) or an F344 (cross-fostered) dam and F344 rats adopted by an SD dam (cross-fostered) showed a suppression of the HPA axis response following 14 days of repeated restraint stress. In contrast, F344 rats adopted by an F344 dam (in-fostered) did not show such HPA axis habituation. We also found that F344 rats adopted by an F344 dam showed increased anxiety-related behaviors in social interaction and novelty-suppressed feeding tests as a result of the 14 days of restraint stress, while SD rats adopted by either an SD or an F344 dam and F344 rats adopted by an SD dam showed normal anxiety-related behaviors under the same experimental conditions. These results suggest that while genetic differences between SD and F344 strains account for some of the variations in stress vulnerability, maternal factors also contribute.",M2

While adrenal autotransplantation in the setting of Cushing's disease has been described, intramuscular adrenal allotransplantation as a cure for adrenal insufficiency to our knowledge has not been previously carried out. Current treatment for adrenal insufficiency leaves patients without diurnal variation in cortisol release and susceptible to the detrimental effects of chronic hypercortisolism. We describe here the case of a 5-year-old girl with renal failure who had adrenal insufficiency following fulminant meningococcemia that led to requirements for both stress-dose steroid and mineralocorticoid replacement. Ten months after the onset of her disease, she received a simultaneous renal and adrenal gland transplant from her mother. The adrenal gland allograft was morselized into 1 mm(3) segments and implanted into three 2 cm pockets created in her rectus abdominis muscle. Three years after surgery, her allograft remains fully functional, responding well to adrenocorticotropin hormone stimulation and the patient does not require any steroid or mineral-corticoid supplementation. We believe this case represents the first description of successful functional intramuscular adrenal allograft transplantation with long-term follow up as a cure for adrenal insufficiency.",M2
19957892,"Ascorbate defense system and response of steroid producing glands under reserpine treatment in albino rats (Rattus norvegicus).Reserpine functions as an anti-stress agent providing relaxation to animals under stressful conditions. An attempt was made to find out functions of reserpine in unstressed albino rats and its role in steroidogenesis. The effects of the drug (25 and 35 microg, im daily for 3-5 days) were observed by recording the changes in body weights, concentration of ascorbate (liver and <e>adrenals</e>) and cholesterol (liver, adrenal and testes) of the animals. A dose of 25 microg reserpine 3-5 days was ineffective as there were no significant changes after the treatment. On the other hand 35 microg reserpine was found to be effective because there was significant increase in body weights, levels of ascorbate and cholesterol in respective tissues after 3-5 days administration. Therefore it is clear that in unstressed animals reserpine is stimulatory for liver but inhibitory for adrenal and testes under high doses.",M2
19955259,"Epidemiology of <e>adrenal</e> crisis in chronic adrenal insufficiency: the need for new prevention strategies.OBJECTIVE: Adrenal crisis (AC) is a life-threatening complication of adrenal insufficiency (AI). Here, we evaluated frequency, causes and risk factors of AC in patients with chronic AI. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 883 patients with AI were contacted by mail. Five-hundred and twenty-six patients agreed to participate and received a disease-specific questionnaire. RESULTS: Four-hundred and forty-four datasets were available for analysis (primary AI (PAI), n=254; secondary AI (SAI), n=190). Forty-two percent (PAI 47% and SAI 35%) reported at least one crisis. Three hundred and eighty-four AC in 6092 patient years were documented (frequency of 6.3 crises/100 patient years). Precipitating causes were mainly gastrointestinal infection and fever (45%) but also other stressful events (e.g. major pain, surgery, psychic distress, heat and pregnancy). Sudden onset of apparently unexplained AC was also reported (PAI 6.6% and SAI 12.7%). Patients with PAI reported more frequent emergency glucocorticoid administration (42.5 vs 28.4%, P=0.003). Crisis incidence was not influenced by educational status, body mass index, glucocorticoid dose, DHEA treatment, age at diagnosis, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism or GH deficiency. In PAI, patients with concomitant non-endocrine disease were at higher risk of crisis (odds ratio (OR)=2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-3.89, P=0.036). In SAI, female sex (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.06-4.5, P=0.035) and diabetes insipidus (OR=2.71, 95% CI 1.22-5.99, P=0.014) were associated with higher crisis incidence. CONCLUSION: AC occurs in a substantial proportion of patients with chronic AI, mainly triggered by infectious disease. Only a limited number of risk factors suitable for targeting prevention of AC were identified. These findings indicate the need for new concepts of crisis prevention in patients with AI.",M2

A case report and mini-review of the literature.BACKGROUND: Infections caused by Nocardia farcinica are uncommon and show a great variety of clinical manifestations in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Because of its unspecific symptoms and tendency to disseminate it may mimic the clinical symptoms and radiologic findings of a tumour disease and the diagnosis of nocardiosis can easily be missed, because there are no characteristic symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of an adrenal gland abscess caused by subacute disseminated N. farcinica pneumonia.

19943926,"Measurement of tissue cortisol levels in patients with severe burns: a preliminary investigation.INTRODUCTION: The assessment of <e>adrenal</e> function in critically ill patients is problematic, and there is evidence to suggest that measurement of tissue glucocorticoid activity may be more useful than estimation of plasma cortisol concentrations. Interstitial cortisol concentrations of cortisol represent the available pool of glucocorticoids able to enter the cell and bind to the glucocorticoid receptor. However the concentrations of plasma cortisol may not accurately reflect interstitial concentrations. We elected to perform a preliminary study into the feasibility of measuring interstitial cortisol by microdialysis, and to investigate the relationship between total plasma cortisol, free plasma cortisol and interstitial cortisol in patients with severe burns. METHODS: A prospective observational study carried out in a tertiary intensive care unit. Ten adult patients with a mean total burn surface area of 48% were studied. Interstitial cortisol was measured by microdialysis from patient-matched burnt and non-burnt tissue and compared with that of 3 healthy volunteers. Plasma sampling for estimations of total and free cortisol concentrations was performed concurrently. RESULTS: In the burn patients, mean total plasma and free plasma cortisol concentrations were 8.8 +/- 3.9, and 1.7 +/- 1.1 mcg/dL, (p &lt; 0.001), respectively. Mean subcutaneous microdialysis cortisol concentrations in the burn and non-burn tissue were 0.80 +/- 0.31 vs 0.74 +/- 0.41 mcg/dL (p = 0.8), respectively, and were significantly elevated over the mean subcutaneous microdialysis cortisol concentrations in the healthy volunteers. There was no significant correlation between total plasma or free plasma and microdialysis cortisol concentrations. Plasma free cortisol was better correlated with total burn surface area than total cortisol. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, interstitial cortisol concentrations measured by microdialysis in burnt and non-burnt skin from patients with severe thermal injury are significantly elevated over those from healthy volunteers. Plasma estimations of cortisol do not correlate with the microdialysis levels, raising the possibility that plasma cortisol may be an unreliable guide to tissue cortisol activity.",M2

19942208,"Adrenocortical incidentaloma with uncertain prognosis associated with an inadequately treated congenital <e>adrenal</e> hyperplasia.Large adrenal tumors are rarely associated with adrenal enzymatic deficiency, except in 11-ss-hydroxylase insufficiency. These tumors are exceptionally malignant. We report here the case of a patient with a congenital 21-hydroxylase deficiency (compound heterozygote for two severe mutations in the CYP21A2 gene) untreated for 20 years. His evaluation at 36 years of age showed a four-centimeter mass in the left adrenal gland, with most characteristics suggestive of malignancy (CT and positron emission tomography [PET] scan). We performed a surgical resection that established the diagnosis of adrenocortical tumor of uncertain prognosis (Weiss's score: 3). Even though malignant tumors are unusual in adrenal deficiency, our observation shows the need for a replacement therapy during adulthood, with a regular CT scan follow up in order to diagnose early isolated adrenal adenoma and remove it in case of malignancy suspicion.",M2
19931358,"Stress hormone synthesis in mouse hypothalamus and <e>adrenal</e> gland triggered by restraint is dependent on pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide signaling.Stress responses are elicited by a variety of stimuli and are aimed at counteracting direct or perceived threats to the well-being of an organism. In the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems, specific cell groups constitute signaling circuits that indicate the presence of a stressor and elaborate an adequate response. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is expressed in central and peripheral parts of these circuits and has recently been identified as a candidate for regulation of the stress axis. In the present experiments, we tested the involvement of PACAP in the response to a psychological stressor in vivo. We used a restraint paradigm and compared PACAP-deficient mice (PACAP-/-) to wild-type controls (PACAP+/+). Acute secretion of corticosterone elicited by 1 h of restraint was found to be identical between genotypes, whereas sustained secretion provoked by 6 h of unrelieved restraint was 48% lower in PACAP-/-mice. Within the latter time frame, expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) was increased in the hypothalamus of wild type, but not PACAP-deficient mice. Expression of the activity-regulated transcription factors Egr1 (early growth response 1) and Fos (FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene) in the hypothalamus was rapidly and transiently induced by restraint in a PACAP-dependent fashion, a pattern that was also found in the adrenal glands. Here, abundance of transcripts encoding enzymes required for adrenomedullary catecholamine biosynthesis, namely TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) and PNMT (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase), was higher in PACAP+/+ mice after 6 h of unrelieved restraint. Our results suggest that sustained corticosterone secretion, synthesis of the hypophysiotropic hormone CRH in the hypothalamus, and synthesis of the enzymes producing the hormone adrenaline in the adrenal medulla, are controlled by PACAP signaling in the mouse. These findings identify PACAP as a major contributor to the stimulus-secretion-synthesis coupling that supports stress responses in vivo.",M2
19931309,"ACTH receptor blockade: a novel approach to treat congenital <e>adrenal</e> hyperplasia, or Cushing's disease.It is hypothesized that blocking the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) receptor, using either a blocking antibody or a drug will result in a medical cortical-adrenalectomy, with relative sparing of mineralocorticoid hormone production. This would be similar to the clinical findings in familial glucocorticoid deficiency type 1, an autosomal recessive condition due to inactivating mutations of the adrenal receptor for ACTH, also known as the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R). It is further hypothesized that MC2R blockade should allow using lower glucocorticoid doses to treat congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to enzyme deficiency of either 21-hydroxylase (CYP21B) or 11-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), thus reaching a better final adult height than with current therapeutic strategies. Blocking the ACTH receptor can also be employed to medically treat Cushing's due to excess pituitary or ectopic ACTH production.",M2
19923365,"Fetal <e>adrenal</e> gland alterations in a rat model of adverse intrauterine environment.By feeding a low-sodium diet to dams over the last third of gestation, we have developed an animal model of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Given that fetal adrenal development and maturation occur during late gestation in rats, the aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of proteins and enzymes involved in steroidogenesis and catecholamine synthesis in adrenal glands from IUGR fetuses. A gene microarray was performed to investigate for alteration in the pathways participating in hormone production. Results show that increased aldosterone serum concentrations in IUGR fetuses were associated with higher mRNA adrenal levels of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT(1)R) and cytochrome P450 aldosterone synthase in response to decreased serum sodium content. Conversely, reduced serum corticosterone concentrations in these fetuses appear to result from alterations in gene expression involved in cholesterol metabolism, such as the augmented apolipoprotein E levels, and in steroidogenesis, like the decreased levels of cytochrome P45011beta-hydroxylase. Furthermore, increased AT(2)R expression and the presence of hypoxia and oxidative stress may, in turn, explain the higher adrenal mRNA levels of enzymes involved in catecholamine synthesis. Despite this increase, catecholamine adrenal content was reduced in males and was similar in females compared with sex-matched controls, suggesting higher catecholamine secretion. This could be associated with the induction of genes involved in inflammation-related, acute-phase response in IUGR fetuses. All of these alterations could have long-lasting health effects and may, hence, be implicated in the pathogenesis of increased blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy observed in IUGR adult animals from this model.",M2
19923096,"[Role of the endocrine system in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]The most frequent liver disorder in metabolic syndrome is the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Its pathogenesis is a complex, multifactorial process, characterized by insulin resistance and involvement of the endocrine system. Hypothyroidism may lead to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis via hyperlipidemia and obesity. Adult patients with growth hormone deficiency have a metabolic syndrome-like phenotype with obesity and many characteristic metabolic alterations. The chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> axis results in metabolic syndrome as well. Cushing's syndrome has also features of metabolic syndrome. Mild elevation of transaminase activities is commonly seen in patients with adrenal failure. Non-alcoholic steatosis is twice as common in postmenopusal as in premenopausal women and hormonal replacement therapy decreases the risk of steatosis. Insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus type 2, sleeping apnoe syndrome, cardiovascular disorders and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are more frequent in polycystic ovary syndrome. Hypoandrogenism in males and hyperandrogenism in females may lead to fatty liver via obesity and insulin resistance. Adipokines (leptin, acylation stimulating protein, adiponectin) have a potential role in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver. The alterations of endocrine system must be considered in the background of cryptogenic liver diseases. The endocrine perspective may help the therapeutic approaches in the future.",M2
19917065,"Dalcetrapib: no off-target toxicity on blood pressure or on genes related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in rats.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The association between torcetrapib and its off-target effects on blood pressure suggested a possible class-specific effect. The effects of dalcetrapib (RO4607381/JTT-705) and torcetrapib on haemodynamics and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) were therefore assessed in a rat model. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate were measured by telemetry in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) receiving torcetrapib 10, 40 or 80 mg kg(-1) day(-1); dalcetrapib 100, 300 or 500 mg(-1) kg day(-1); or vehicle (placebo) for 5 days. Expression of RAAS genes in <e>adrenal</e> gland, kidney, aorta and lung from normotensive rats following 5 days' treatment with torcetrapib 40 mg kg(-1) day(-1), dalcetrapib 500 mg kg(-1) day(-1) or vehicle was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. KEY RESULTS: Torcetrapib transiently increased mean AP in normotensive rats (+3.7 +/- 0.1 mmHg), whereas treatment in SHR resulted in a dose-dependent and sustained increase [+6.5 +/- 0.6 mmHg with 40 mg kg(-1) day(-1) at day 1 (P &lt; 0.05 versus placebo)], which lasted over the treatment period. No changes in AP or heart rate were observed with dalcetrapib. Torcetrapib, but not dalcetrapib, increased RAAS-related mRNAs in adrenal glands and aortas. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In contrast to torcetrapib, dalcetrapib did not increase blood pressure or RAAS-related gene expression in rats, suggesting that the off-target effects of torcetrapib are not a common feature of all compounds acting on cholesteryl ester transfer protein.",M2
19915020,"ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome with bilateral micronodular <e>adrenal</e> hyperplasia and ectopic adrenocortical adenoma.CONTEXT: Bilateral micronodular adrenal hyperplasia and ectopic adrenocortical adenoma are two rare causes of ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate a 35-yr-old woman with ACTH-independent hypercortisolism associated with both micronodular adrenal hyperplasia and ectopic pararenal adrenocortical adenoma. DESIGN AND SETTING: In vivo and in vitro studies were performed in a University Hospital Department and academic research laboratories. INTERVENTION: Mutations of the PRKAR1A, PDE8B, and PDE11A genes were searched for in leukocytes and adrenocortical tissues. The ability of adrenal and adenoma tissues to synthesize cortisol was investigated by immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, and/or cell culture studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Detection of 17alpha-hydroxylase and 21-hydroxylase immunoreactivities, quantification of CYP11B1 mRNA in adrenal and adenoma tissues, and measurement of cortisol levels in supernatants by radioimmunological assays were the main outcomes. RESULTS: Histological examination of the adrenals revealed nonpigmented micronodular cortical hyperplasia associated with relative atrophy of internodular cortex. No genomic and/or somatic adrenal mutations of the PRKAR1A, PDE8B, and PDE11A genes were detected. 17alpha-Hydroxylase and 21-hydroxylase immunoreactivities as well as CYP11B1 mRNA were detected in adrenal and adenoma tissues. ACTH and dexamethasone activated cortisol secretion from adenoma cells. The stimulatory action of dexamethasone was mediated by a nongenomic effect involving the protein kinase A pathway. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that unknown molecular defects can favor both micronodular adrenal hyperplasia and ectopic adrenocortical adenoma associated with Cushing's syndrome.",M2
19913782,"Effect of particulate antigenic stimulation or in vivo administration of interleukin-6 on the level of steroidogenic enzymes in <e>adrenal</e> glands and lymphoid tissues of mice with parallel alteration in endogenous inflammatory cytokine level.To study the effects of sheep red blood cells (SRBC), viable Escherichia coli inoculation and IL-6 administration on steroidogenesis, activities and expression of hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase enzymes (3betaHSD and 17betaHSD) were measured in lymphoid organs of control and infected mice after 3 weeks treatment. Serum testosterone and cytokine levels were also estimated. Reduced expression of 3betaHSD4 was found in the spleen of treated groups as compared to control, whereas the 3betaHSD4 expression was increased in the thymus and lymph gland after stimulation. Reduced serum testosterone level was observed after antigenic stimulation and also altered serum IL-12p70, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, MCP-1 or IL-10 level. These studies provide the evidence of expression of 3betaHSD4 enzyme in the murine lymphoid organs after particulate antigen stimulation along with a parallel alteration in endogenous cytokine level.",M2
19913596,"Increase of beta-endorphin secretion by agmatine is induced by activation of imidazoline I(2A) receptors in <e>adrenal</e> gland of rats.Activation of imidazoline I(2) receptor (I(2)R) by agmatine in adrenal gland lowers plasma glucose through increment in beta-endorphin release to stimulate the opioid mu-receptor in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ rats). However, the subtype of I(2)R for agmatine-induced blood glucose lowering effect remains obscure. In the present study, agmatine treatment increased beta-endorphin secretion and this effect was blocked by I(2)R antagonist (BU224) in the isolated adrenal medulla. We further used amiloride, an established blocker of I(2A)R, to identify the subtype of I(2)R in adrenal gland. Results showed that agmatine-induced beta-endorphin release from adrenal gland was blocked by 0.1muM amiloride indicating the mediation of I(2A)R. It was further confirmed that agmatine-induced plasma glucose decrement and plasma beta-endorphin increment in STZ rats were blocked by amiloride. However, amiloride failed to modify the action of guanidine, an agonist of I(2B)R, at the sufficient dose to block beta-endorphin secretion. Taken together, the increase of plasma beta-endorphin by agmatine in STZ rats through activation of imidazoline I(2)R was mainly induced by the I(2A) subtype located in adrenal gland. Thus, imidazoline I(2A) receptor in the adrenal gland might be applied as a new target for induction of opioid secretion.",M2
19912476,"The medial amygdala modulates body weight but not neuroendocrine responses to chronic stress.Stress pathologies such as depression and eating disorders (i.e. anorexia nervosa) are associated with amygdalar dysfunction, which are linked with hypothalamic-pituitary-<e>adrenal</e> axis (HPA) axis hyperactivity. The medial amygdaloid nucleus (MeA), a key output nucleus of the amygdaloid complex, promotes HPA axis activation to acute psychogenic stress and is in a prime position to mediate the deleterious effects of chronic stress on physiology and behaviour. The present study tests the hypothesis that the MeA is necessary for the development of maladaptive physiological changes caused by prolonged stress exposure. Male rats received bilateral ibotenate or sham lesions targeting the MeA and one half underwent 2 weeks of chronic variable stress (CVS) or served as home cage controls. Sixteen hours post CVS, all animals were exposed to an acute restraint challenge. CVS induced thymic involution, adrenal hypertrophy, and attenuated body weight gain and up-regulation of hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing hormone mRNA expression. Consistent with previous literature, lesions of the MeA dampened stress-induced increases in corticosterone after 30 min of exposure to acute restraint stress. However, this effect was independent of CVS exposure, suggesting that the MeA may not be critical for modulating neuroendocrine responses after chronic HPA axis drive. Interestingly, lesion of the MeA modestly exaggerated the stress-induced attenuation of weight gain. Overall, the data obtained suggest that the MeA modulates the neuroendocrine responses to acute but not chronic stress. In addition, the data suggest that the MeA may be an important neural component for the control of body weight in the face of chronic stress.",M2

Kisspeptins have also been reported to stimulate the aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex. However, the expression of kisspeptins in human adrenal glands and adrenal tumors has not been clarified yet. We, therefore, studied the presence of kisspeptin-like immunoreactivity (LI) in human adrenal glands and adrenal tumors (adrenocortical adenomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas) by radioimmunoassay and immunocytochemistry. Kisspeptin-LI was detected in all the tissues examined; normal portions of adrenal glands (3.0 +/- 2.3 pmol/g wet weight, n = 21, mean +/- SD), aldosterone-producing adenomas (4.6 +/- 3.3 pmol/g wet weight, n = 10), cortisol-producing adenomas (2.7 +/- 1.4 pmol/g wet weight, n = 14), adrenocortical carcinomas (1.7 +/- 0.2 pmol/g wet weight, n = 4), and pheochromocytomas (1.8 +/- 0.8 pmol/g wet weight, n = 6). There was no significant difference in kisspeptin-LI levels among them. Immunocytochemistry showed positive kisspeptin-immunostaining in normal adrenal glands, with stronger immunostaining found in the medulla. Furthermore, positive kisspeptin-immunostaining was found in all types of adrenal tumors examined; adrenocortical adenomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas. The intensity of kisspeptin-immunostaining in these adrenal tumors was, however, not so strong as that in normal adrenal medulla. The present study has shown for the first time the presence of kisspeptin-LI in adrenal glands and adrenal tumors.",M2

We report a patient with massive bilateral adrenal enlargement due to histoplasmosis that was diagnosed by EUS-FNA. Trans-duodenal and trans-gastric fine needle aspiration biopsy of both adrenal glands was performed. Rapid onsite cytopathologic evaluation (ROSE) revealed epithelioid histiocytes, singly and in clusters consistent with granulomas. Apparent intracytoplasmic inclusions suggestive of organisms were visible. A Gomori Methenamine Silver stain (GMS) revealed abundant small intracellular budding yeasts, morphologically consistent with Histoplasma; the patient was admitted for amphotericin B intravenous infusion. His fever abated on the second day after amphotericin B was started. His urine Histoplasma antigen was positive. Fungal cultures from both adrenal EUS-FNA samples grew Histoplasma capsulatum. After a one week hospital stay, he was discharged home on itraconazole 200 mg po bid for one year. Four months after initiation of treatment, his urine Histoplasma antigen was undetectable. Nine months after initial diagnosis, the patient regained his energy level, and returned to work with complete resolution of his initial symptoms. This case highlights that EUS-FNA with ROSE can be a highly effective tool in the diagnosis of uncommon infections of the adrenal glands.",M2
19888563,"ACTH: cellular peptide hormone synthesis and secretory pathways.Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is derived from the prohormone, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). This precursor undergoes proteolytic cleavage to yield a number of different peptides which vary depending on the tissue. In the anterior pituitary, POMC is processed to ACTH by the prohormone convertase, PC1 and packaged in secretory granules ready for stimulated secretion. In response to stress, corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH), stimulates release of ACTH from the pituitary cell which in turn causes release of glucocorticoids from the <e>adrenal</e> gland. In tissues, such as the hypothalamus and skin, ACTH is further processed intracellularly to alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alphaMSH) which has distinct roles in these tissues. The prohormone, POMC, is itself released from cells and found in the human circulation at concentrations greater than ACTH. While much is known about the tightly regulated synthesis of POMC, there is still a lot to learn about the mechanisms for differentiating secretion of POMC, and the POMC-derived peptides. Understanding what happens to the POMC released from cells will provide new insights into its function.",M2

Serum serotonin, histamine and corticosterone levels increased 0.5 h after C48/80 treatment, but their increases were reduced thereafter. Adrenal total ascorbic acid (ascorbic acid plus dehydroascorbic acid), ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid levels decreased 0.5, 3 or 6 h after C48/80 treatment, adrenal lipid peroxide level increased at 3 and 6 h, adrenal non-protein-SH level decreased at 3 and 6 h and adrenal beta-tocopherol level decreased at 3 h. Ketotifen, a mast cell stabilizer (1 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally at 0.5 h before C48/80 treatment, attenuated all these changes found in the serum and adrenal at 3 h after treatment, while beta-tocopherol (250 mg/kg), administered orally at 0.5 h after C48/80 treatment, attenuated all these changes in the adrenal tissue. These results indicate that C48/80 causes oxidative stress in rat adrenal gland through mast cell degranulation.",M2
19882499,"Evaluation of a standardized protocol for processing <e>adrenal</e> tumor samples: preparation for a European adrenal tumor bank.Storage and tissue handling of surgical tumor specimen have been recognized as critical steps that can potentially affect reproducibility and comparability of molecular endpoints between laboratories. In the preparation of adrenal tumor tissue banking, three different protocols that simulate warm ischemia upon tumor removal (protocol I), thawing and refreezing cycles (protocol II), as well as storage of vital tumor samples (protocol III) were applied. For the first two protocols, samples were subdivided and either snap frozen or treated with a RNA preserving agent (RPA) while in protocol III different storage media were compared. Following these procedures, recovery and integrity of DNA, RNA, and protein by means of pulsed field electrophoresis, long-range PCR, real-time PCR, immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry (protocol I and II) as well as cell viability and steroidogenic capacity (protocol III) were investigated. While DNA integrity was not influenced by different treatment modalities, expression levels of adrenal marker genes were more affected in samples after snap freezing in comparison to RPA pretreatment. Moreover, storage at room temperature before and after freezing could be demonstrated to decrease the relative amount of protein phosphorylation (ERK) and enzymatic activity (succinate cytochrome c reductase) while overall protein levels were not significantly affected. Similarly, morphological or immunohistochemical evaluation was comparable between groups. For primary cell cultures generated after storage of tumor samples similar rates of viability were observable while steroid output varied between the groups. Overall, on the basis of the presented endpoints standardized operational procedures can be defined for a proposed European adrenal tumor biobank.",M2
19881342,"Transient <e>adrenal</e> insufficiency in the premature newborn.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Relative adrenal insufficiency is a controversial phenomenon described in adults and children with critical illness, especially septic shock. In the past 2 decades, relative adrenal insufficiency has also been reported in the critically ill premature as well as term newborn. The present study will review the initial and more recent studies addressing adrenal insufficiency in the premature infant. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies suggest that 'relative adrenal insufficiency' is a contributing factor to hemodynamic instability in the sick preterm newborn. Many ill preterm newborns have inappropriately low serum cortisol concentrations and respond to steroid administration. Adrenal insufficiency is transient and likely reflects normal adrenal physiology at younger gestational ages. There is no general consensus on its diagnosis, effective minimum dose for treatment and duration of treatment. SUMMARY: More large scale, multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies are needed to make the diagnosis of relative adrenal insufficiency and to determine the indication, dose, complications and outcome of glucocorticoid therapy.",M2

SF-1 knock-out mouse models exhibit complete adrenal and gonadal agenesis. Human mutations of this transcription factor, were initially associated with primary adrenal failure and male gonadal dysgenesis with various degrees of under androgenization. More recently, identification of novel SF-1 mutations responsible for isolated 46, XY gonadal dysgenesis or 46, XX primary ovarian insufficiency, underscores its central role in the control and maintenance of adrenal and reproductive functions.

The basal hormonal study and functional testing and imaging oriented towards a pituitary origin. An inferior sinus petrosus venous sampling after CRH stimulus confirmed the pituitary origin of ACTH hypersecretion. After transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary microadenoma, analytical and clinical remission was achieved, with relapse three years later, so a new transsphenoidal surgery was performed and stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy was administered. In subsequent years, cortisol hypersecretion persisted, requiring continued medical treatment with increasing doses of adrenolitic drugs. In its evolution, ACTH levels showed a downward trend and abdominal CT scan showed a hypodense mass of 21 x 41 mm in the left adrenal. Iodocholesterol scan also showed increased uptake at this level. Based on these findings and given the persistence of hypercortisolism, left adrenalectomy was ultimately carried out by laparoscopic surgery in May 2008. After this new surgery, signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism improved markedly, and glucocorticoid replacement was needed. Although in this case the functional autonomy of the nodule is not firmly established, the efficacy of unilateral adrenalectomy is clear.",M2
