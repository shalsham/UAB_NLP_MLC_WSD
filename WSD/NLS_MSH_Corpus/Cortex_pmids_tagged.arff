20554885,"Neuroelectromagnetic correlates of perceptual closure processes.Perceptual closure refers to the coherent perception of an object under circumstances when the visual information is incomplete. Although the perceptual closure index observed in electroencephalography reflects that an object has been recognized, the full spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical source activity underlying perceptual closure processing remain unknown so far. To address this question, we recorded magnetoencephalographic activity in 15 subjects (11 females) during a visual closure task and performed beamforming over a sequence of successive short time windows to localize high-frequency gamma-band activity (60-100 Hz). Two-tone images of human faces (Mooney faces) were used to examine perceptual closure. Event-related fields exhibited a magnetic closure index between 250 and 325 ms. Time-frequency analyses revealed sustained high-frequency gamma-band activity associated with the processing of Mooney stimuli; closure-related gamma-band activity was observed between 200 and 300 ms over occipitotemporal channels. Time-resolved source reconstruction revealed an early (0-200 ms) coactivation of caudal inferior temporal gyrus (cITG) and regions in posterior parietal <e>cortex</e> (PPC). At the time of perceptual closure (200-400 ms), the activation in cITG extended to the fusiform gyrus, if a face was perceived. Our data provide the first electrophysiological evidence that perceptual closure for Mooney faces starts with an interaction between areas related to processing of three-dimensional structure from shading cues (cITG) and areas associated with the activation of long-term memory templates (PPC). Later, at the moment of perceptual closure, inferior temporal cortex areas specialized for the perceived object are activated, i.e., the fusiform gyrus related to face processing for Mooney stimuli.",M1
20536943,"How spinalized rats can walk: biomechanics, <e>cortex</e>, and hindlimb muscle scaling--implications for rehabilitation.Neonatal spinalized (NST) rats can achieve autonomous weight-supported locomotion never seen after adult injury. Mechanisms that support function in NST rats include increased importance of cortical trunk control and altered biomechanical control strategies for stance and locomotion. Hindlimbs are isolated from perturbations in quiet stance and act in opposition to forelimbs in locomotion in NST rats. Control of roll and yaw of the hindlimbs is crucial in their locomotion. The biomechanics of the hind limbs of NST rats are also likely crucial. We present new data showing the whole leg musculature scales proportional to normal rat musculature in NST rats, regardless of function. This scaling is a prerequisite for the NST rats to most effectively use pattern generation mechanisms and motor patterns that are similar to those present in intact rats. Pattern generation may be built into the lumbar spinal cord by evolution and matched to the limb biomechanics, so preserved muscle scaling may be essential to the NST function observed.",M1
20534523,"Alterations of cortical pyramidal neurons in mice lacking high-affinity nicotinic receptors.The neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are allosteric membrane proteins involved in multiple cognitive processes, including attention, learning, and memory. The most abundant form of heterooligomeric nAChRs in the brain contains the beta2- and alpha4- subunits and binds nicotinic agonists with high affinity. In the present study, we investigated in the mouse the consequences of the deletion of one of the nAChR components: the beta2-subunit (beta2(-/-)) on the microanatomy of cortical pyramidal cells. Using an intracellular injection method, complete basal dendritic arbors of 650 layer III pyramidal neurons were sampled from seven cortical fields, including primary sensory, motor, and associational areas, in both beta2(-/-) and WT animals. We observed that the pyramidal cell phenotype shows significant quantitative differences among different cortical areas in mutant and WT mice. In WT mice, the density of dendritic spines was rather similar in all cortical fields, except in the prelimbic/infralimbic <e>cortex</e>, where it was significantly higher. In the absence of the beta2-subunit, the most significant reduction in the density of spines took place in this high-order associational field. Our data suggest that the beta2-subunit is involved in the dendritic morphogenesis of pyramidal neurons and, in particular, in the circuits that contribute to the high-order functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex.",M1

To appraise these models and evaluate interpretations of neuroimaging findings, the authors review evidence pertaining to the psychological and behavioural consequences of insula lesions. The authors focus on the emotional, perceptual, sensorimotor symptoms and disorders of body awareness associated with insula damage. This comprehensive review is intended to inform existing neuropsychological models of insula function in order to guide future research.",M1
20519520,"Reduced cortical BDNF expression and aberrant memory in Carf knock-out mice.Transcription factors are a key point of convergence between the cell-intrinsic and extracellular signals that guide synaptic development and brain plasticity. Calcium-response factor (CaRF) is a unique transcription factor first identified as a binding protein for a calcium-response element in the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf). We have now generated Carf knock-out (KO) mice to characterize the function of this factor in vivo. Intriguingly, Carf KO mice have selectively reduced expression of Bdnf exon IV-containing mRNA transcripts and BDNF protein in the cerebral <e>cortex</e>, whereas BDNF levels in the hippocampus and striatum remain unchanged, implicating CaRF as a brain region-selective regulator of BDNF expression. At the cellular level, Carf KO mice show altered expression of GABAergic proteins at striatal synapses, raising the possibility that CaRF may contribute to aspects of inhibitory synapse development. Carf KO mice show normal spatial learning in the Morris water maze and normal context-dependent fear conditioning. However they have an enhanced ability to find a new platform location on the first day of reversal training in the water maze and they extinguish conditioned fear more slowly than their wild-type littermates. Finally, Carf KO mice show normal short-term (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) in a novel object recognition task, but exhibit impairments during the remote memory phase of testing. Together, these data reveal novel roles for CaRF in the organization and/or function of neural circuits that underlie essential aspects of learning and memory.",M1
20514993,"Protective role of salidroside against aging in a mouse model induced by D-galactose.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effects of putative AGEs (advanced glycation endproducts) inhibitor salidroside against aging in an accelerated mouse aging model induced by D-galactose. METHODS: A group of 5-month-old C57BL/6J mice were treated daily with D-galactose, D-galactose combined with salidroside, salidroside alone, and control buffer for 8 weeks. At the end of the treatment, serum AGEs levels, neurological activities, expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in the cerebral <e>cortex</e>, as well as lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2 production were determined. RESULTS: D-galactose induced mouse aging model was developed as described before. As expected, salidroside blocked D-galactose induced increase of serum AGEs levels. It also reversed D-galactose induced aging effects in neural and immune system, as evidenced by improving motor activity, increasing memory latency time, and enhancing lymphocyte mitogenesis and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. Furthermore, elevated expression of GFAP and NT-3 in the aged model mice was also reduced upon salidroside treatment. CONCLUSION: Salidroside inhibits AGEs formation in vivo, which at least partially contributes to its anti-aging effect in D-galactose induced aging model.",M1
20511283,"Heterogeneous neuronal firing patterns during interictal epileptiform discharges in the human <e>cortex</e>.Epileptic cortex is characterized by paroxysmal electrical discharges. Analysis of these interictal discharges typically manifests as spike-wave complexes on electroencephalography, and plays a critical role in diagnosing and treating epilepsy. Despite their fundamental importance, little is known about the neurophysiological mechanisms generating these events in human focal epilepsy. Using three different systems of microelectrodes, we recorded local field potentials and single-unit action potentials during interictal discharges in patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy undergoing diagnostic workup for localization of seizure foci. We studied 336 single units in 20 patients. Ten different cortical areas and the hippocampus, including regions both inside and outside the seizure focus, were sampled. In three of these patients, high density microelectrode arrays simultaneously recorded between 43 and 166 single units from a small (4 mm x 4 mm) patch of cortex. We examined how the firing rates of individual neurons changed during interictal discharges by determining whether the firing rate during the event was the same, above or below a median baseline firing rate estimated from interictal discharge-free periods (Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis, P&lt;0.05). Only 48% of the recorded units showed such a modulation in firing rate within 500 ms of the discharge. Units modulated during the discharge exhibited significantly higher baseline firing and bursting rates than unmodulated units. As expected, many units (27% of the modulated population) showed an increase in firing rate during the fast segment of the discharge (+ or - 35 ms from the peak of the discharge), while 50% showed a decrease during the slow wave. Notably, in direct contrast to predictions based on models of a pure paroxysmal depolarizing shift, 7.7% of modulated units recorded in or near the seizure focus showed a decrease in activity well ahead (0-300 ms) of the discharge onset, while 12.2% of units increased in activity in this period. No such pre-discharge changes were seen in regions well outside the seizure focus. In many recordings there was also a decrease in broadband field potential activity during this same pre-discharge period. The different patterns of interictal discharge-modulated firing were classified into more than 15 different categories. This heterogeneity in single unit activity was present within small cortical regions as well as inside and outside the seizure onset zone, suggesting that interictal epileptiform activity in patients with epilepsy is not a simple paroxysm of hypersynchronous excitatory activity, but rather represents an interplay of multiple distinct neuronal types within complex neuronal networks.",M1
20511130,"The effects of 17beta-estradiol and vitamin E treatments on oxidative stress and antioxidant levels in brain <e>cortex</e> of diabetic ovariectomized rats.We investigated the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E 2 ) and vitamin E on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant levels in brain cortex of diabetic ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Forty-two rats were equally divided into seven groups: Control; OVX; OVX+E 2 ; OVX+E 2 +vitamin E; OVX+diabetic; OVX+diabetic+E 2 and OVX+diabetic+E 2 +vitamin E. Then, E 2 (40 microg kg -1 /day) and vitamin E (100 mg kg -1 /day) were given. Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), vitamin A and beta-carotene in brain were decreased (p&lt;0.05) when compared with control in OVX but MDA in brain and glucose in plasma were elevated (p&lt;0.05). The antioxidant levels in brain (p&lt;0.05) increased although MDA (p&lt;0.05) in brain and glucose (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01) in plasma decreased in OVX after E 2 and E 2 +vitamin E supplementation. The activities of GSH-Px (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.01), CAT (p&lt;005, p&lt;0.001) and SOD (p&lt;0.001) and the levels of GSH (p&lt;0.001), vitamin A (p&lt;0.05) and beta-carotene (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.05) were lower in the brain of OVX diabetic rats, while MDA in the brain and glucose in the plasma were higher (p&lt;0.001). The antioxidant enzymes (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01), GSH, vitamin A and beta-carotene (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001) in brain increased while MDA in brain and glucose in plasma decreased (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001) in diabetic OVX after treatments. Finally, the E 2 and E 2 +vitamin E supplementation to diabetic OVX and OVX rats may strengthen the antioxidant system by reducing lipid peroxidation.",M1
20510860,"Strong CA2 pyramidal neuron synapses define a powerful disynaptic cortico-hippocampal loop.Neurons propagate information through circuits by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs to generate an action potential output. Inputs from different origins are often targeted to distinct regions of a neuron's dendritic tree, with synapses on more distal dendrites normally having a weaker influence on cellular output compared to synapses on more proximal dendrites. Here, we report that hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons, whose function has remained obscure for 75 years, have a reversed synaptic strength rule. Thus, CA2 neurons are strongly excited by their distal dendritic inputs from entorhinal <e>cortex</e> but only weakly activated by their more proximal dendritic inputs from hippocampal CA3 neurons. CA2 neurons in turn make strong excitatory synaptic contacts with CA1 neurons. In this manner, CA2 neurons form the nexus of a highly plastic disynaptic circuit linking the cortical input to the hippocampus to its CA1 neuronal output. This circuit is likely to mediate key aspects of hippocampal-dependent spatial memory.",M1
20510857,"Cux1 and Cux2 regulate dendritic branching, spine morphology, and synapses of the upper layer neurons of the <e>cortex</e>.Dendrite branching and spine formation determines the function of morphologically distinct and specialized neuronal subclasses. However, little is known about the programs instructing specific branching patterns in vertebrate neurons and whether such programs influence dendritic spines and synapses. Using knockout and knockdown studies combined with morphological, molecular, and electrophysiological analysis, we show that the homeobox Cux1 and Cux2 are intrinsic and complementary regulators of dendrite branching, spine development, and synapse formation in layer II-III neurons of the cerebral cortex. Cux genes control the number and maturation of dendritic spines partly through direct regulation of the expression of Xlr3b and Xlr4b, chromatin remodeling genes previously implicated in cognitive defects. Accordingly, abnormal dendrites and synapses in Cux2(-/-) mice correlate with reduced synaptic function and defects in working memory. These demonstrate critical roles of Cux in dendritogenesis and highlight subclass-specific mechanisms of synapse regulation that contribute to the establishment of cognitive circuits.",M1
20505096,"Diversity of lysophosphatidic acid receptor-mediated intracellular calcium signaling in early cortical neurogenesis.Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a membrane-derived lysophospholipid that can induce pleomorphic effects in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from the cerebral <e>cortex</e>, including alterations in ionic conductance. LPA-induced, calcium-mediated conductance changes have been reported; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been determined. We show here that activation of specific cognate receptors accounts for nearly all intracellular calcium responses evoked by LPA in acutely cultured nestin-positive NPCs from the developing mouse cerebral cortex. Fast-onset changes in intracellular calcium levels required release from thapsigargin-sensitive stores by a pertussis toxin-insensitive mechanism. The influx of extracellular calcium through Cd(2+)/Ni(2+)-insensitive influx pathways, approximately one-half of which were Gd(3+) sensitive, contributed to the temporal diversity of responses. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR revealed the presence of all five known LPA receptors in primary NPCs, with prominent expression of LPA(1), LPA(2), and LPA(4). Combined genetic and pharmacological studies indicated that NPC responses were mediated by LPA(1) (approximately 30% of the cells), LPA(2) (approximately 30%), a combination of receptors on single cells (approximately 30%), and non-LPA(1,2,3) pathways (approximately 10%). LPA responsivity was significantly reduced in more differentiated TuJ1(+) cells within cultures. Calcium transients in a large proportion of LPA-responsive NPCs were also initiated by the closely related signaling lipid S1P (sphingosine-1-phosphate). These data demonstrate for the first time the involvement of LPA receptors in mediating surprisingly diverse NPC calcium responses involving multiple receptor subtypes that function within a single cell. Compared with other known factors, lysophospholipids represent the major activator of calcium signaling identified within NPCs at this early stage in corticogenesis.",M1

20491233,"Hemispheric prevalence during chewing in normal right-handed and left-handed subjects: a functional magnetic resonance imaging preliminary study.This study evaluated the activation of different cortical areas during nondeliberate chewing of soft and hard boluses in five right-handed and five left-handed subjects with normal occlusion, to determine different hemispheric prevalences. The study was conducted with a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (1.5 T Magnetom Vision - Siemens Medical, Germany) using a head coil. The results showed that the most frequently activated areas were Brodmann's areas four and six in the primary motor and premotor <e>cortex</e>, the insula and Broca's area and, overall, showed greater activity of the cortical mastication area (CMA) in the right hemisphere for right-handed and in the left hemisphere for left-handed subjects.",M1
20484681,"White and gray matter alterations in adults with Niemann-Pick disease type C: a cross-sectional study.OBJECTIVE: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a progressive neurovisceral disorder with disrupted intracellular cholesterol metabolism that results in significant alterations to neuronal and axonal structure. Adult patients present with ataxia, gaze palsy, impaired cognition, and neuropsychiatric illness, but the neural substrate has not been well-characterized in vivo. Our aim was to investigate a well-characterized sample of adults with confirmed NPC for gray and white matter abnormalities. METHODS: We utilized a combination of optimized voxel-based morphometry of T1-weighted images and tract-based spatial statistics of diffusion tensor images to examine gray matter volume and white matter structural differences in 6 adult patients with NPC and 18 gender- and age-matched controls. RESULTS: Patients with NPC demonstrated bilateral gray matter reductions in large clusters in bilateral hippocampus, thalamus, superior cerebellum, and insula, in addition to smaller regions of inferoposterior <e>cortex</e>. Patients demonstrated widespread reductions in fractional anisotropy in major white matter tracts. Subsequent analysis of measures of axial and radial diffusivity suggest that these changes are contributed to by both impaired myelination and altered axonal structure. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in gray matter areas are broadly consistent with human and animal studies of selective vulnerability of neuronal populations to the neuropathology of NPC, whereas more widespread white matter changes are consistent with the hypothesis that disrupted myelination and axonal structure predate changes to the neuronal cell body. These findings suggest that volumetric analysis of gray matter and diffusion tensor imaging may be useful modalities for indexing illness stage and monitoring response to emerging treatment.",M1
20484649,"Connexin 43 mediates the tangential to radial migratory switch in ventrally derived cortical interneurons.The adult cerebral <e>cortex</e> is composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that arise from progenitor cells in disparate proliferative regions in the developing brain and follow different migratory paths. Excitatory pyramidal neurons originate near the ventricle and migrate radially to their position in the cortical plate along radial glial fibers. On the other hand, inhibitory interneurons arise in the ventral telencephalon and migrate tangentially to enter the developing cortex before migrating radially to reach their correct laminar position. Gap junction adhesion has been shown to play an important mechanistic role in the radial migration of excitatory neurons. We asked whether a similar mechanism governs the tangential or radial migration of inhibitory interneurons. Using short hairpin RNA knockdown of Connexin 43 (Cx43) and Cx26 together with rescue experiments, we found that gap junctions are dispensable for the tangential migration of interneurons, but that Cx43 plays a role in the switch from tangential to radial migration that allows interneurons to enter the cortical plate and find their correct laminar position. Moreover this action is dependent on the adhesive properties and the C terminus of Cx43 but not the Cx43 channel. Thus, the radial phase of interneuron migration resembles that of excitatory neuron migration in terms of dependence on Cx43 adhesion. Furthermore, gap junctions between migrating interneurons and radial processes were observed by electron microscopy. These findings provide mechanistic and structural support for a gap junction-mediated interaction between migrating interneurons and radial glia during the switch from tangential to radial migration.",M1
20484634,"Postnatal switch from synaptic to extrasynaptic transmission between interneurons and NG2 cells.NG2 cells, oligodendrocyte precursors, play a critical role in myelination during postnatal brain maturation, but a pool of these precursors is maintained in the adult and recruited to lesions in demyelinating diseases. NG2 cells in immature animals have recently been shown to receive synaptic inputs from neurons, and these have been assumed to persist in the adult. Here, we investigated the GABAergic synaptic activity of NG2 cells in acute slices of the barrel <e>cortex</e> of NG2-DsRed transgenic mice during the first postnatal month, which corresponds to the period of active myelination in the neocortex. Our data demonstrated that the frequency of spontaneous and miniature GABAergic synaptic activity of cortical NG2 cells dramatically decreases after the second postnatal week, indicating a decrease in the number of synaptic inputs onto NG2 cells during development. However, NG2 cells still receive GABAergic inputs from interneurons in the adult cortex. These inputs do not rely on the presence of functional synapses but involve a form of GABA spillover. This GABA volume transmission allows interneurons to induce phasic responses in target NG2 cells through the activation of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. Hence, after development is complete, volume transmission allows NG2 cells to integrate neuronal activity patterns at frequencies occurring during in vivo sensory stimulation.",M1
20483717,"Decreased cerebral cortical serotonin transporter binding in ecstasy users: a positron emission tomography/[(11)C]DASB and structural brain imaging study.Animal data indicate that the recreational drug ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) can damage brain serotonin neurons. However, human neuroimaging measurements of serotonin transporter binding, a serotonin neuron marker, remain contradictory, especially regarding brain areas affected; and the possibility that structural brain differences might account for serotonin transporter binding changes has not been explored. We measured brain serotonin transporter binding using [(11)C] N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio) benzylamine in 50 control subjects and in 49 chronic (mean 4 years) ecstasy users (typically one to two tablets bi-monthly) withdrawn from the drug (mean 45 days). A magnetic resonance image for positron emission tomography image co-registration and structural analyses was acquired. Hair toxicology confirmed group allocation but also indicated use of other psychoactive drugs in most users. Serotonin transporter binding in ecstasy users was significantly decreased throughout all cerebral cortices (range -19 to -46%) and hippocampus (-21%) and related to the extent of drug use (years, maximum dose), but was normal in basal ganglia and midbrain. Substantial overlap was observed between control and user values except for insular <e>cortex</e>, in which 51% of ecstasy user values fell below the lower limit of the control range. Voxel-based analyses confirmed a caudorostral gradient of cortical serotonin transporter binding loss with occipital cortex most severely affected. Magnetic resonance image measurement revealed no overall regional volume differences between groups; however, a slight left-hemispheric biased cortical thinning was detected in methamphetamine-using ecstasy users. The serotonin transporter binding loss was not related to structural changes or partial volume effect, use of other stimulant drugs, blood testosterone or oestradiol levels, major serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphisms, gender, psychiatric status, or self-reported hyperthermia or tolerance. The ecstasy group, although 'grossly behaviourally normal', reported subnormal mood and demonstrated generally modest deficits on some tests of attention, executive function and memory, with the latter associated with serotonin transporter decrease. Our findings suggest that the 'typical'/low dose (one to two tablets/session) chronic ecstasy-polydrug user might display a highly selective mild to marked loss of serotonin transporter in cerebral cortex/hippocampus in the range of that observed in Parkinson's disease, which is not gender-specific or completely accounted for by structural brain changes, recent use of other drugs (as assessed by hair analyses) or other potential confounds that we could address. The striking sparing of serotonin transporter-rich striatum (although possibly affected in 'heavier' users) suggests that serotonergic neurons innervating cerebral cortex are more susceptible, for unknown reasons, to ecstasy than those innervating subcortical regions and that behavioural problems in some ecstasy users during abstinence might be related to serotonin transporter changes limited to cortical regions.",M1
20445062,"PICK1 regulates incorporation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors during cortical synaptic strengthening.While AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) found at principal neuron excitatory synapses typically contain the GluR2 subunit, several forms of behavioral experience have been linked to the de novo synaptic insertion of calcium-permeable (CP) AMPARs, defined by their lack of GluR2. In particular, whisker experience drives synaptic potentiation as well as the incorporation of CP-AMPARs in the neocortex. Previous studies implicate PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase-1) in activity-dependent internalization of GluR2, suggesting one potential mechanism leading to the subsequent accumulation of synaptic CP-AMPARs and increased synaptic strength. Here we test this hypothesis by using a whisker stimulation paradigm in PICK1 knock-out mice. We demonstrate that PICK1 facilitates the surface expression of CP-AMPARs and is indispensable for their experience-dependent synaptic insertion. However, the failure to incorporate CP-AMPARs in PICK1 knock-outs does not preclude sensory-induced enhancement of synaptic currents. Our results indicate that synaptic strengthening in the early postnatal <e>cortex</e> does not require PICK1 or the addition of GluR2-lacking AMPARs. Instead, PICK1 permits changes in AMPAR subunit composition to occur in conjunction with synaptic potentiation.",M1

20439733,"Neural basis of global resting-state fMRI activity.Functional MRI (fMRI) has uncovered widespread hemodynamic fluctuations in the brain during rest. Recent electroencephalographic work in humans and microelectrode recordings in anesthetized monkeys have shown this activity to be correlated with slow changes in neural activity. Here we report that the spontaneous fluctuations in the local field potential (LFP) measured from a single cortical site in monkeys at rest exhibit widespread, positive correlations with fMRI signals over nearly the entire cerebral <e>cortex</e>. This correlation was especially consistent in a band of upper gamma-range frequencies (40-80 Hz), for which the hemodynamic signal lagged the neural signal by 6-8 s. A strong, positive correlation was also observed in a band of lower frequencies (2-15 Hz), albeit with a lag closer to zero. The global pattern of correlation with spontaneous fMRI fluctuations was similar whether the LFP signal was measured in occipital, parietal, or frontal electrodes. This coupling was, however, dependent on the monkey's behavioral state, being stronger and anticipatory when the animals' eyes were closed. These results indicate that the often discarded global component of fMRI fluctuations measured during the resting state is tightly coupled with underlying neural activity.",M1
20437558,"Recurrent spreading depolarizations after subarachnoid hemorrhage decreases oxygen availability in human cerebral <e>cortex</e>.OBJECTIVE: Delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) contributes to poor outcome in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients. Because there is continuing uncertainty as to whether proximal cerebral artery vasospasm is the only cause of DIND, other processes should be considered. A potential candidate is cortical spreading depolarization (CSD)-induced hypoxia. We hypothesized that recurrent CSDs influence cortical oxygen availability. METHODS: Centers in the Cooperative Study of Brain Injury Depolarizations (COSBID) recruited 9 patients with severe SAH, who underwent open neurosurgery. We used simultaneous, colocalized recordings of electrocorticography and tissue oxygen pressure (p(ti)O(2)) in human cerebral cortex. We screened for delayed cortical infarcts by using sequential brain imaging and investigated cerebral vasospasm by angiography or time-of-flight magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: In a total recording time of 850 hours, 120 CSDs were found in 8 of 9 patients. Fifty-five CSDs ( approximately 46%) were found in only 2 of 9 patients, who later developed DIND. Eighty-nine ( approximately 75%) of all CSDs occurred between the 5th and 7th day after SAH, and 96 (80%) arose within temporal clusters of recurrent CSD. Clusters of CSD occurred simultaneously, with mainly biphasic CSD-associated p(ti)O(2) responses comprising a primary hypoxic and a secondary hyperoxic phase. The frequency of CSD correlated positively with the duration of the hypoxic phase and negatively with that of the hyperoxic phase. Hypoxic phases significantly increased stepwise within CSD clusters; particularly in DIND patients, biphasic p(ti)O(2) responses changed to monophasic p(ti)O(2) decreases within these clusters. Monophasic hypoxic p(ti)O(2) responses to CSD were found predominantly in DIND patients. INTERPRETATION: We attribute these clinical p(ti)O(2) findings mainly to changes in local blood flow in the cortical microcirculation but also to augmented metabolism. Besides classical contributors like proximal cerebral vasospasm, CSD clusters may reduce O(2) supply and increase O(2) consumption, and thereby promote DIND.",M1
20435084,"The role of protein kinase C in the opening of blood-brain barrier induced by electromagnetic pulse.The aim of this study was to determine the role of protein kinase C signaling in electromagnetic pulse (EMP)-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability change in rats.

It was found that the protein level of PKC and PKC-betaII (but not PKC-alpha) in cerebral cortex microvessels increased significantly at 0.5h and 1h after EMP exposure compared with sham-exposed animals and then recovered at 3h. A specific PKC antagonist (H7) almost blocked EMP-induced BBB permeability change. EMP-induced BBB tight junction protein ZO-1 translocation was also inhibited. Our data indicated that PKC signaling was involved in EMP-induced BBB permeability change and ZO-1 translocation in rat.",M1
20435005,"Decoding a perceptual decision process across <e>cortex</e>.Perceptual decisions arise from the activity of neurons distributed across brain circuits. But, decoding the mechanisms behind this cognitive operation across brain circuits has long posed a difficult problem. We recorded the neuronal activity of diverse cortical areas, while monkeys performed a vibrotactile discrimination task. We find that the encoding of the stimuli during the stimulus periods, working memory, and comparison periods is widely distributed across cortical areas. Notably, during the comparison and postponed decision report periods the activity of frontal brain circuits encode both the result of the sensory evaluation that corresponds to the monkey's possible choices and past information on which the decision is based. These results suggest that frontal lobe circuits are more engaged in the readout of sensory information from working memory, when it is required to be compared with other sensory inputs, than simply engaged in motor responses during this task.",M1
20432689,"[Specificity of auditory evoked potencials changes in participants of Chernobyl accident consequences: I. Analysis of early N1 component]Amplitude-time characteristics analysis of the N1 component of auditory cognitive evoked potentials (EP) was made in 10 persons who had participated in the cleanup of the Chenobyl Accident - liquidators (mean age 50.5 +/- 4.0 years old) and in 10 healthy subjects (mean age 47 +/- 6.0 years old). Comparison of amplitude features of the N1 auditory EP component in liquidators of the Chernobyl Accident found a decrease in all areas of the <e>cortex</e> with the maximum decrease in the central and frontal leads, and also an inversion in reactive changes to stimuli of different significance in comparison to healthy subjects of the same age. The most distinct differences between the healthy subjects and liquidators of the Chernobyl Accident were found for time characteristics of the N1 component. They show a significantly smaller value of latent period (LP) for all stimuli and for all experimental tasks in comparison with healthy subjects and more distinct for a significant stimulus when persons counted these stimuli. Analysis of regional changes in LP of the N1 component found that liquidators, in comparison with healthy subjects, have maximal differences in the frontal area of the left hemisphere which were accompanied with inversion asymmetry of LP in this component. Less distinct changes were observed in the central area with relatively little damage in the parietal area. Detected changes in the amplitude-time characteristics of the N1 component of the auditory cognitive EP in liquidators of Chernobyl Accident can show an abnormality in primary attention and its reserves due to weakened inhibitory processes in comparison with healthy subjects, which has similarities of old age. The obtained data supports the hypothesis about the accelerated brain aging in liquidators of Chernobyl Accident as a result of low dosage radiation effects; however, it also allows the pathological development of the brain ageing due to the effects of radiation.",M1
20427726,"Impact of elevated dietary sodium intake on NAD(P)H oxidase and SOD in the <e>cortex</e> and medulla of the rat kidney.Pathophysiological states, including cardiovascular and renal diseases, are characterized by oxidative stress but what is less clear is whether physiological challenges incur a degree of altered oxidative metabolism. To this end, this study examined whether exposure to a high dietary sodium intake could cause an oxidative stress at the kidney. Animals, placed on either 0.3% or 3% sodium diets for 2 wk, were given a lethal dose of anesthetic, and kidneys were removed to analyze both NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression and activities in the cortex and medulla. Placing animals on the high-sodium diet raised sodium and water excretion and caused an approximately 14-fold increase in urinary excretion of 8-isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, which was attenuated by chronic treatment with apocynin to prevent NAD(P)H oxidase activity. The protein expression of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunits NOX2 and p47(phox) and overall NAD(P)H oxidase activity were approximately doubled in the cortex of the rats on the high-sodium diet compared with those on the normal sodium intake while both SOD activity and expression were unchanged. By contrast, neither NOX nor SOD protein expression or activity were altered in the medulla when the rats were placed on the high-sodium intake. These data suggest that an elevation in dietary sodium intake can lead to increased generation of reactive oxygen species and a state of oxidative stress in the cortex but not to such a degree that it extends to the medulla.",M1
20427654,"Abeta-mediated NMDA receptor endocytosis in Alzheimer's disease involves ubiquitination of the tyrosine phosphatase STEP61.Amyloid beta (Abeta) is involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may contribute to cognitive deficits by increasing internalization of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase 61 (STEP(61)), which is targeted in part to the postsynaptic terminal, has been implicated in this process. Here we show that STEP(61) levels are progressively increased in the <e>cortex</e> of Tg2576 mice over the first year, as well as in prefrontal cortex of human AD brains. The increased STEP(61) was associated with greater STEP activity, dephosphorylation of phospho-tyr(1472) of the NR2B subunit, and decreased NR1 and NR2B subunits on neuronal membranes. Treatment with Abeta-enriched medium also increased STEP(61) levels and decreased NR1/NR2B abundance in mouse cortical cultures as determined by biotinylation experiments. In STEP knock-out cultures, Abeta treatment failed to induce NMDA receptor internalization. The mechanism for the increase in STEP(61) levels appears to involve the ubiquitin proteasome system. Blocking the proteasome resulted in elevated levels of STEP(61). Moreover, STEP(61)-ubiquitin conjugates were increased in wild-type cortical slices upon Abeta treatment as well as in 12 month Tg2576 cortex. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which Abeta-mediated accumulation of STEP(61) results in increased internalization of NR1/NR2B receptor that may contribute to the cognitive deficits in AD.",M1
20427645,"Fibrinogen triggers astrocyte scar formation by promoting the availability of active TGF-beta after vascular damage.Scar formation in the nervous system begins within hours after traumatic injury and is characterized primarily by reactive astrocytes depositing proteoglycans that inhibit regeneration. A fundamental question in CNS repair has been the identity of the initial molecular mediator that triggers glial scar formation. Here we show that the blood protein fibrinogen, which leaks into the CNS immediately after blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption or vascular damage, serves as an early signal for the induction of glial scar formation via the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway. Our studies revealed that fibrinogen is a carrier of latent TGF-beta and induces phosphorylation of Smad2 in astrocytes that leads to inhibition of neurite outgrowth. Consistent with these findings, genetic or pharmacologic depletion of fibrinogen in mice reduces active TGF-beta, Smad2 phosphorylation, glial cell activation, and neurocan deposition after cortical injury. Furthermore, stereotactic injection of fibrinogen into the mouse <e>cortex</e> is sufficient to induce astrogliosis. Inhibition of the TGF-beta receptor pathway abolishes the fibrinogen-induced effects on glial scar formation in vivo and in vitro. These results identify fibrinogen as a primary astrocyte activation signal, provide evidence that deposition of inhibitory proteoglycans is induced by a blood protein that leaks in the CNS after vasculature rupture, and point to TGF-beta as a molecular link between vascular permeability and scar formation.",M1
20421989,"A reaction-diffusion model of human brain development.Cortical folding exhibits both reproducibility and variability in the geometry and topology of its patterns. These two properties are obviously the result of the brain development that goes through local cellular and molecular interactions which have important consequences on the global shape of the <e>cortex</e>. Hypotheses to explain the convoluted aspect of the brain are still intensively debated and do not focus necessarily on the variability of folds. Here we propose a phenomenological model based on reaction-diffusion mechanisms involving Turing morphogens that are responsible for the differential growth of two types of areas, sulci (bottom of folds) and gyri (top of folds). We use a finite element approach of our model that is able to compute the evolution of morphogens on any kind of surface and to deform it through an iterative process. Our model mimics the progressive folding of the cortical surface along foetal development. Moreover it reveals patterns of reproducibility when we look at several realizations of the model from a noisy initial condition. However this reproducibility must be tempered by the fact that a same fold engendered by the model can have different topological properties, in one or several parts. These two results on the reproducibility and variability of the model echo the sulcal roots theory that postulates the existence of anatomical entities around which the folding organizes itself. These sulcal roots would correspond to initial conditions in our model. Last but not least, the parameters of our model are able to produce different kinds of patterns that can be linked to developmental pathologies such as polymicrogyria and lissencephaly. The main significance of our model is that it proposes a first approach to the issue of reproducibility and variability of the cortical folding.",M1
20419608,"[Developmental malformations of the cerebral <e>cortex</e>]Migration disorders (MD) are increasingly recognized as an important cause of epilepsy and developmental delay. Up to 25 % of children with refractory epilepsy have a cortical malformation. MD encompass a wide spectrum with underlying genetic etiologies and clinical manifestations. Research regarding the delineation of the genetic and molecular basis of these disorders has provided greater insight into the pathogenesis of not only the malformation but also the process involved in normal cortical development. Diagnosis of MD is important since patients who fail three antiepileptic medications are less likely to have their seizures controlled with additional trials of medications and therefore epilepsy surgery should be considered. Recent improvements in neuroimaging have resulted in a significant increase in the recognition of MD. Findings can be subdivided in disorders due to abnormal neurogenesis, neuronal migration, neuronal migration arrest and neuronal organization resulting in different malformations like microcephaly, lissencephaly, schizencephaly and heterotopia. The examination protocol should include T 1-w and T 2-w sequences in adequate slice orientation. T 1-w turbo-inversion recovery sequences (TIR) can be helpful to diagnose heterotopia. Contrast agent is needed only to exclude other differential diagnoses.",M1
20418074,"Complex pattern of cortical thinning in schizophrenia: results from an automated surface based analysis of cortical thickness.A considerable body of evidence from structural brain imaging studies suggests that patients with schizophrenia have significant alterations of gray matter density. Additionally, recently developed surface-based analysis approaches demonstrate reduced cortical thickness in patients with schizophrenia. However, the number of studies employing this relatively new method is still limited. Specifically, little is known about changes in cortical thickness in schizophrenia patients whose duration of illness is relatively short. Therefore, the present study sought to examine cortical thickness in a large sample of patients with adult onset schizophrenia and an average duration of illness of 4.4 years, using an automated analysis method over the entire <e>cortex</e>. A significantly decreased cortical thickness in prefrontal and temporolimbic regions as well as parieto-occipital cortical areas was hypothesized. A sample of 58 patients with schizophrenia and 58 age- and sex-matched healthy controls was investigated using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an automated algorithm for extraction of the cortical surface in order to assess local cortical thinning across the entire cerebrum. Significant reduction of cortical thickness in schizophrenia was found in a spatially complex pattern of focal anatomical regions. This pattern comprised the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as the medial prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal cortices, left entorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and lingual cortex, bilaterally. A complex fronto-temporo-parietal pattern of reduced cortical thickness in schizophrenia was observed. This pattern is consistent with a disruption of neurofunctional networks previously implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",M1

Modeling the oxidative stress was achieved with addition of H(2)O(2) into the nutrient medium. In order to prevent an oxidative stress-induced cytotoxic effect, concomitantly with H(2)O(2), vitamins E and C were added into the nutrient medium. Oxygen, lipid and nitrogen free radicals were registered by method Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and spin-traps. The data, obtained in our study revealed decreasing of intensity of NO content and increasing of spin trapped superoxid- (O(2-)) and lipoperoxid-radicals (LOO.) in explants of brain cortex of the newborn albino rats cultured in oxidative stress conditions. These changes were attenuated following action of vitamins E and C (decreasing of intensity of EPR signals of O2- and LOO, increasing of free NO content).",M1
20412388,"Off-line concomitant release of dopamine and glutamate involvement in taste memory consolidation.It has been postulated that memory consolidation process requires post-learning molecular changes that will support long-term experiences. In the present study, we assessed with in vivo microdialysis and capillary electrophoresis whether such changes involve the release of neurotransmitters at post-acquisition stages. Using conditioned taste aversion paradigm we observed spontaneous off-line (i.e. in absence of stimulation) dopamine and glutamate reactivation within the insular <e>cortex</e> about 45 min after the stimuli association. These increments did not appear in control groups that were unable to acquire the task, and it seems to be dependent on amygdala activity since its reversible inactivation by tetrodotoxin impaired cortical off-line release of both neurotransmitters and memory consolidation. In addition, blockade of dopaminergic D1 and/or NMDA receptors before the off-line activity impaired long- but not short-term memory. These results suggest that off-line extracellular increments of glutamate and dopamine have a significant functional role in consolidation of taste memory.",M1
20410105,"Brain plasticity and intellectual ability are influenced by shared genes.Although the adult brain is considered to be fully developed and stable until senescence when its size steadily decreases, such stability seems at odds with continued human (intellectual) development throughout life. Moreover, although variation in human brain size is highly heritable, we do not know the extent to which genes contribute to individual differences in brain plasticity. In this longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging study in twins, we report considerable thinning of the frontal <e>cortex</e> and thickening of the medial temporal cortex with increasing age and find this change to be heritable and partly related to cognitive ability. Specifically, adults with higher intelligence show attenuated cortical thinning and more pronounced cortical thickening over time than do subjects with average or below average IQ. Genes influencing variability in both intelligence and brain plasticity partly drive these associations. Thus, not only does the brain continue to change well into adulthood, these changes are functionally relevant because they are related to intelligence.",M1
20404408,"Plasticity of multisensory dorsal stream functions: evidence from congenitally blind and sighted adults.The dorsal stream has been proposed to compute vision for space perception and for the control of action. However, perceiving space and guiding movements is not only based on vision but also on other sensory modalities such as proprioception and kinesthesia. Blind people who lost vision early in life provide an exceptional example to study the plasticity of dorsal stream functions. Using fMRI and psychophysical methods, action control and space perception was investigated in congenitally blind and sighted adults while performing active and passive hand movements without visual feedback. The functional imaging data showed largely overlapping activation patterns for kinesthetically guided hand movements in congenitally blind and sighted participants covering regions of the dorsal stream. In contrast to the sighted participants, congenitally blind participants additionally activated the extrastriate <e>cortex</e> and the auditory cortex. The psychophysical results revealed a significant correlation between proprioceptive spatial discrimination acuity of the blind and the age when they had attended an orientation and mobility training, i.e., an extensive non-visual spatial training. The earlier the blind acquired such a spatial training the more accurate and the more precise was their space perception in later life. Our findings suggest a multisensory network of movement control that develops on the basis of sensorimotor feedback rather than being under the exclusive control of vision. Thus, visual deprivation seems to result in both cross-modal and compensatory intra-modal plasticity. The present findings further imply that dorsal stream functions are shaped by non-visual spatial information during early development.",M1
20404404,"Cortical activity during tactile exploration of objects in blind and sighted humans.PURPOSE: Recent studies show evidence of multisensory representation in the functionally normal visual <e>cortex</e>, but this idea remains controversial. Occipital cortex activation is often claimed to be a reflection of mental visual imagery processes triggered by other modalities. However, if the occipital cortex is genuinely active during touch, this might be the basis for the massive cross-modal plasticity observed in the congenitally blind. METHODS: To address these issues, we used fMRI to compare patterns of activation evoked by a tactile object recognition (TOR) task (right or left hand) in 8 sighted and 8 congenitally blind subjects, with several other control tasks. RESULTS: TOR robustly activated object selective regions in the lateral occipital complex (LOC/LOtv) in the blind (similar to the patterns of activation found in the sighted), indicating that object identification per se (i.e. in the absence of visual imagery) is sufficient to evoke responses in the LOC/LOtv. Importantly, there was negligible occipital activation for hand movements (imitating object palpations) in the occipital cortex, in both groups. Moreover, in both groups, TOR activation in the LOC/LOtv was bilateral, regardless of the palpating hand (similar to the lack of strong visual field preference in the LOC/LOtv for viewed objects). Finally, the most prominent enhancement in TOR activation in the congenitally blind (compared to their sighted peers) was found in the posterior occipital cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that visual imagery is not an obligatory condition for object activation in visual cortex. It also demonstrates the massive plasticity in visual cortex of the blind for tactile object recognition that involves both the ventral and dorsal occipital areas, probably to support the high demand for this function in the blind.",M1
20399735,"Episodic future thinking reduces reward delay discounting through an enhancement of prefrontal-mediotemporal interactions.Humans discount the value of future rewards over time. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neural coupling analyses that episodic future thinking reduces the rate of delay discounting through a modulation of neural decision-making and episodic future thinking networks. In addition to a standard control condition, real subject-specific episodic event cues were presented during a delay discounting task. Spontaneous episodic imagery during cue processing predicted how much subjects changed their preferences toward more future-minded choice behavior. Neural valuation signals in the anterior cingulate <e>cortex</e> and functional coupling of this region with hippocampus and amygdala predicted the degree to which future thinking modulated individual preference functions. A second experiment replicated the behavioral effects and ruled out alternative explanations such as date-based processing and temporal focus. The present data reveal a mechanism through which neural decision-making and prospection networks can interact to generate future-minded choice behavior.",M1
20399207,"Decreased and increased cortical activation coexist in de novo Parkinson's disease.Previous fMRI studies using motor tasks yielded conflicting results concerning the activation pattern in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Possible explanations of these discrepancies include differences in the clinical features of the examined patients and in the executed tasks and incomplete task monitoring. We evaluated with fMRI 20 patients with untreated de-novo PD and 11 healthy controls with a simple motor task consisting of self-paced continuous right hand-tapping. The task was monitored on-line with a dedicated device which measures the strength and frequency of the tapping. Fifteen patients performed the task correctly. The frequency was not significantly different, whereas force was slightly different between patients (26.4+/-3.0 N) and controls (28.5+/-2.4 N) (p=0.046, Mann-Whitney U-test). After insertion of the subject's frequency and force as covariate variables in the model, PD patients compared to controls showed areas of significantly [Z statistic image&gt;5.1 and p&lt; or =0.05 (corrected) cluster significance] lower activation in the left primary sensorimotor (SM1) <e>cortex</e> and cerebellum and higher activation in the left temporal-parietal cortex adjacent to the SM1 and in right SM1. Furthermore in PD patients the disease severity evaluated with the Hoehn and Yahr staging system correlated significantly [Z statistic image&gt;2.3 and p&lt; or =0.05 (corrected) cluster significance] with activation of left SM1 and supplementary motor area and cingulum, bilaterally. The mixed pattern of decreased and increased cortical activation in de novo PD patients possibly reflects the coexistence of cortical deafferentation, and compensatory phenomena by cortico-cortical circuits.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 10 freely moving rats with carbon electrodes implanted into the cortex and dorsomedial hypothalamus, averaged frequency spectra (0.5-30 Hz) of the EEG were studied for five consecutive days either under sham exposures (five rats) or under mixed sham/MW-exposures (five rats). The rats were exposed to ELF-MW (915 MHz, 20-ms pulse duration, approximately 0.3 mW/cm(2), 4 Hz) intermittently (1-min 'On', 1-min 'Off') for 10 min (specific absorption rate, SAR, approximately 0.7 mW/g on average) several times per day, with 10-min pre- and post-exposure periods. RESULTS: In baseline EEG, the activities of 3.2-6.0 Hz and 17.8-30.5 Hz dominated in the cortex and of 6.0-17.8 Hz in the hypothalamus. This cortical-hypothalamic imbalance was relatively stable at sham-exposures and insensitive to ELF-MW in all frequency ranges but one. ELF-MW increased the beta(2) (17.8-30.5 Hz) level in the hypothalamus to a greater extent than in the cortex, causing significant diminishing of the initial EEG bias between them. Moreover, a cumulative phenomenon under repeated exposures to ELF-MW was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: These results are in line with evidence that repeated low-level exposure to ELF-MW affects brain functioning and provide an additional approach when analysing underlying mechanisms.",M1

The count of fused cells (dikaryons) increased significantly in experimental and sham-operated (control) animals in comparison with the early period (7 days) after surgery. Normalization of the dikaryon and mononuclear cell structure was observed after 56 days. Presumably, cell fusion promotes their morphological restoration and regeneration of the lost functional capacity.

Histological studies of the cortex from the zone of regular epileptic activity registration were carried out in 23 cases. A relationship between completeness of radical removal of the zone of regular epileptic activity and treatment results was detected.

20393464,"Control of cortical GABA circuitry development by Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling.Schizophrenia is a complex disorder that interferes with the function of several brain systems required for cognition and normal social behaviour. Although the most notable clinical aspects of the disease only become apparent during late adolescence or early adulthood, many lines of evidence suggest that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic component. Several independent studies have identified neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor ERBB4 as important risk genes for schizophrenia, although their precise role in the disease process remains unknown. Here we show that Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling controls the development of inhibitory circuitries in the mammalian cerebral <e>cortex</e> by cell-autonomously regulating the connectivity of specific GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-containing interneurons. In contrast to the prevalent view, which supports a role for these genes in the formation and function of excitatory synapses between pyramidal cells, we found that ErbB4 expression in the mouse neocortex and hippocampus is largely confined to certain classes of interneurons. In particular, ErbB4 is expressed by many parvalbumin-expressing chandelier and basket cells, where it localizes to axon terminals and postsynaptic densities receiving glutamatergic input. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrate that ErbB4 cell-autonomously promotes the formation of axo-axonic inhibitory synapses over pyramidal cells, and that this function is probably mediated by Nrg1. In addition, ErbB4 expression in GABA-containing interneurons regulates the formation of excitatory synapses onto the dendrites of these cells. By contrast, ErbB4 is dispensable for excitatory transmission between pyramidal neurons. Altogether, our results indicate that Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling is required for the wiring of GABA-mediated circuits in the postnatal cortex, providing a new perspective to the involvement of these genes in the aetiology of schizophrenia.",M1
20392976,"Atrophy mainly affects the limbic system and the deep grey matter at the first stage of multiple sclerosis.BACKGROUND: The existence of grey matter (GM) atrophy right after the first clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains controversial. The aim of this study was therefore to establish whether regional GM atrophy is already present in the earliest stage of MS assessing regional GM atrophy in a large group of patients. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) were examined on a 1.5 T MR imager within 6 months after their first clinical events. A group of 37 matched healthy control subjects were also included in the study. An optimised voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method customised for MS was applied on volumetric T(1)-weighted images. The functional status of patients was assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the Brief Repeatable Battery. RESULTS: VBM analysis (p&lt;0.005, familywise error corrected) on patients versus control subjects showed the presence of significant focal GM atrophy in patients involving the bilateral insula, the bilateral orbitofrontal cortices, the bilateral internal and inferior temporal regions, the posterior cingulate <e>cortex</e>, the bilateral thalami, the bilateral caudate nuclei, the bilateral lenticular nuclei and the bilateral cerebellum. EDSS was slightly correlated (rho=-0.37 p=0.0027) with the atrophy of the right cerebellum. No correlations have been evidenced between the cognitive status of patients and the regional GM atrophy. CONCLUSION: The present study performed on a large group of CIS patients demonstrated that regional GM atrophy is present right after the first clinical event of multiple sclerosis and mainly affects the deep GM and the limbic system.",M1
20392967,"Focal cortical infarcts alter intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation in the reticular thalamic nucleus.Focal cortical injuries result in death of cortical neurons and their efferents and ultimately in death or damage of thalamocortical relay (TCR) neurons that project to the affected cortical area. Neurons of the inhibitory reticular thalamic nucleus (nRT) receive excitatory inputs from corticothalamic and thalamocortical axons and are thus denervated by such injuries, yet nRT cells generally survive these insults to a greater degree than TCR cells. nRT cells inhibit TCR cells, regulate thalamocortical transmission, and generate cerebral rhythms including those involved in thalamocortical epilepsies. The survival and reorganization of nRT after cortical injury would determine recovery of thalamocortical circuits after injury. However, the physiological properties and connectivity of the survivors remain unknown. To study possible alterations in nRT neurons, we used the rat photothrombosis model of cortical stroke. Using in vitro patch-clamp recordings at various times after the photothrombotic injury, we show that localized strokes in the somatosensory <e>cortex</e> induce long-term reductions in intrinsic excitability and evoked synaptic excitation of nRT cells by the end of the first week after the injury. We find that nRT neurons in injured rats show (1) decreased membrane input resistance, (2) reduced low-threshold calcium burst responses, and (3) weaker evoked excitatory synaptic responses. Such alterations in nRT cellular excitability could lead to loss of nRT-mediated inhibition in relay nuclei, increased output of surviving TCR cells, and enhanced thalamocortical excitation, which may facilitate recovery of thalamic and cortical sensory circuits. In addition, such changes could be maladaptive, leading to injury-induced epilepsy.",M1
20392955,"Dlx5 and Dlx6 regulate the development of parvalbumin-expressing cortical interneurons.Dlx5 and Dlx6 homeobox genes are expressed in developing and mature cortical interneurons.

The migration deficits were associated with reduced CXCR4 expression. Transplantation of mutant immature interneurons into a wild-type brain demonstrated that loss of either Dlx5 or Dlx5&amp;6 preferentially reduced the number of mature parvalbumin(+) interneurons; those parvalbumin(+) interneurons that were present had increased dendritic branching. Dlx5/6(+/-) mice, which appear normal histologically, show spontaneous electrographic seizures and reduced power of gamma oscillations. Thus, Dlx5&amp;6 appeared to be required for development and function of somal innervating (parvalbumin(+)) neocortical interneurons. This contrasts with Dlx1, whose function is required for dendrite innervating (calretinin(+), somatostatin(+), and neuropeptide Y(+)) interneurons (Cobos et al., 2005).",M1
20392280,"The neural mechanisms of visual selection: the view from neuropsychology.In this review, we discuss how neuropsychological impairments in visual selection can inform us about how selection normally operates.

This includes linking: (i) bottom-up attentional capture and the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ); (ii) top-down segmentation of displays and the medial PPC; (iii) grouping, individuation and identification, and the inferior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) bilaterally; and (iv) the suppression of saliency and the left IPS. In addition, when neuropsychological studies are combined with fMRI, there is evidence that these regions of the PPC interact with striate and extra-striate cortical areas, which respond to specific properties of stimuli. Selection should be viewed as an emergent property of a network of areas involving both ventral and dorsal cortex.",M1
20389589,"Estimation of directional coupling between cortical areas using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS).This study invesitigated the feasibility of measuring directional coupling between cortical areas with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Cerebral hemodynamic responses were recorded at the primary somatosensory <e>cortex</e> (S1), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), and primary motor cortex (M1) regions of the rat barrel cortex during electrical stimulation of rat whiskers. Deoxyhemoglobin concentration changes were calculated from NIRS recordings and the Granger causality based on the multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model was used to estimate the effective causal connectivity among S1, S2, and M1. The estimated causality patterns of seven rats showed consistent unidirectional coupling between the somatosensory areas and the motor areas (S1 and S2--&gt;M1), which coincided well with our hypothesis because the rats' motor function was completely anesthetized. Our preliminary results suggest that cortico-cortical directional coupling can be successfully investigated with NIRS.",M1
20389079,"Heme oxygenase-2 modulates early pathogenesis after traumatic injury to the immature brain.We determined if heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2), an enzyme that degrades the pro-oxidant heme, confers neuroprotection in the developing brain after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Male HO-2 wild-type (WT) and homozygous knockout (KO) mice at postnatal day 21 were subjected to TBI and euthanized 1, 7, and 14 days later. Relative cerebral blood flow, measured by laser Doppler, cortical and hippocampal pathogenesis, and motor recovery were evaluated at all time points. Cerebral blood flow was found to be similar between experimental groups. Blood flow significantly decreased immediately after injury, returned to baseline by 1 day, and was significantly elevated by 7 days, post-injury. Nonheme iron preferentially accumulated in the ipsilateral <e>cortex</e>, hippocampus, and external capsule in both WT and KO brain-injured genotypes. There were, however, a significantly greater number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and a significantly greater cortical lesion volume in KOs relative to WTs within the first week post-injury. By 14 days post-injury, however, cortical lesion volume and cell density in the hippocampal CA3 region and dorsal thalamus were similar between the two groups. Assays of fine motor function (grip strength) over the first 2 weeks post-injury revealed a general pattern of decreased strength in the contralateral forelimbs of KOs as compared to WTs. Together, these findings demonstrate that deficiency in HO-2 alters both the kinetics of secondary damage and fine motor recovery after TBI.",M1
20385911,"Relationship of cortical atrophy to fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis.BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). Previous studies reported that damage of the corticostriatothalamocortical circuit is critical in its occurrence. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between fatigue in MS and regional cortical and subcortical gray matter atrophy. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: National Institutes of Health. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four patients with MS and 24 matched healthy volunteers who underwent 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging and evaluations of fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) and depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relationship between thalamic and basal ganglia volume, cortical thickness of frontal and parietal lobes, and, in patients, T2 lesion volume and normal-appearing white matter volume and the extent of fatigue. RESULTS: Patients were more fatigued than healthy volunteers (P = .04), while controlling for the effect of depression. Modified Fatigue Impact Scale score correlated with cortical thickness of the parietal lobe (r = -0.50, P = .01), explaining 25% of its variance. The posterior parietal <e>cortex</e> was the only parietal area significantly associated with the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: Cortical atrophy of the parietal lobe had the strongest relationship with fatigue. Given the implications of the posterior parietal cortex in motor planning and integration of information from different sources, our preliminary results suggest that dysfunctions in higher-order aspects of motor control may have a role in determining fatigue in MS.",M1

The neurobiological mechanisms for this effect are not yet understood. In this study we used an animal model of nicotine addiction to examine the possibility that changes in insular cortex levels of dopamine (DA)- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32), a phosphoprotein enriched in DA neurons containing DA D1 receptors, may be associated with changes in vulnerability to nicotine addiction. Once rats acquired self-administration, they were given unlimited access to nicotine (0.01 mg/kg/infusion) for 23 h/day for a total of 10 days. Each infusion was paired with a visual cue (stimulus light) and auditory cue (sound of pump). Nicotine seeking, as assessed under a cue-induced reinstatement paradigm, and markers of DARPP-32 signaling, as assessed using western blot analysis, were examined in separate groups of rats at two different abstinent intervals: 1 and 7 days. Consistent with findings with other drugs of abuse, rats in the 7-day abstinence group took longer to extinguish and responded at higher levels during reinstatement testing as compared with rats in the 1-day reinstatement group. Relative to saline controls, rats in the 7-day but not the 1-day abstinence group had higher levels of DARPP-32 phosphorylated at the protein kinase A site in the insular cortex. These results demonstrate incubation of drug seeking following extended access to nicotine self-administration and suggest that enhanced protein kinase A signaling in the insular cortex via phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34 is associated with this effect.",M1

METHODS: In 6 patients (age range: 42-74 years; 4 men), who underwent percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), the distal biliary tract was stimulated by repeatedly inflating the balloon of the PTBD catheter so that it reached volumes that produced a definite painless sensation. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the cortical response to biliary sensation was examined. RESULTS: Biliary balloon stimulation elicited activation of the insular <e>cortex</e>, prefrontal cortex, and somatosensory cortex (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Biliary balloon stimulation evoked a cerebral cortical response detectable by fMRI.",M1
20374429,"Hypoxic ischemia and proteasome dysfunction alter tau isoform ratio by inhibiting exon 10 splicing.Alternative splicing of tau exon 10 influences microtubule assembly and stability during development and in pathological processes of the central nervous system. However, the cellular events that underlie this pre-mRNA splicing remain to be delineated. In this study, we examined the possibility that ischemic injury, known to change the cellular distribution and expression of several RNA splicing factors, alters the splicing of tau exon 10. Transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery reduced tau exon 10 inclusion in the ischemic cortical area within 12 h, resulting in the induction of three-repeat (3R) tau in cortical neurons. Ubiquitinated protein aggregates and reduced proteasome activity were also observed. Administration of proteasome inhibitors such as MG132, proteasome inhibitor I and lactacystin reduced tau exon 10 splicing in cortical cell cultures. Decreased levels of Tra2beta, an RNA splicing factor responsible for tau exon 10 inclusion, were detected both in cortical cell cultures exposed to MG132 and in cerebral <e>cortex</e> after ischemic injury. Taken together, these findings suggest that transient focal cerebral ischemia reduces tau exon 10 splicing through a mechanism involving proteasome-ubiquitin dysfunction and down-regulation of Tra2beta.",M1
20371827,"Multiple timescale encoding of slowly varying whisker stimulus envelope in cortical and thalamic neurons in vivo.Adaptive processes over many timescales endow neurons with sensitivity to stimulus changes over a similarly wide range of scales. Although spike timing of single neurons can precisely signal rapid fluctuations in their inputs, the mean firing rate can convey information about slower-varying properties of the stimulus. Here, we investigate the firing rate response to a slowly varying envelope of whisker motion in two processing stages of the rat vibrissa pathway. The whiskers of anesthetized rats were moved through a noise trajectory with an amplitude that was sinusoidally modulated at one of several frequencies. In thalamic neurons, we found that the rate response to the stimulus envelope was also sinusoidal, with an approximately frequency-independent phase advance with respect to the input. Responses in <e>cortex</e> were similar but with a phase shift that was about three times larger, consistent with a larger amount of rate adaptation. These response properties can be described as a linear transformation of the input for which a single parameter quantifies the phase shift as well as the degree of adaptation. These results are reproduced by a model of adapting neurons connected by synapses with short-term plasticity, showing that the observed linear response and phase lead can be built up from a network that includes a sequence of nonlinear adapting elements. Our study elucidates how slowly varying envelope information under passive stimulation is preserved and transformed through the vibrissa processing pathway.",M1
20371813,"Structural plasticity underlies experience-dependent functional plasticity of cortical circuits.The stabilization of new spines in the barrel <e>cortex</e> is enhanced after whisker trimming, but its relationship to experience-dependent plasticity is unclear. Here we show that in wild-type mice, whisker potentiation and spine stabilization are most pronounced for layer 5 neurons at the border between spared and deprived barrel columns. In homozygote alphaCaMKII-T286A mice, which lack experience-dependent potentiation of responses to spared whiskers, there is no increase in new spine stabilization at the border between barrel columns after whisker trimming. Our data provide a causal link between new spine synapses and plasticity of adult cortical circuits and suggest that alphaCaMKII autophosphorylation plays a role in the stabilization but not formation of new spines.",M1
20371803,"The disintegrin/metalloproteinase ADAM10 is essential for the establishment of the brain <e>cortex</e>.The metalloproteinase and major amyloid precursor protein (APP) alpha-secretase candidate ADAM10 is responsible for the shedding of proteins important for brain development, such as cadherins, ephrins, and Notch receptors. Adam10(-/-) mice die at embryonic day 9.5, due to major defects in development of somites and vasculogenesis. To investigate the function of ADAM10 in brain, we generated Adam10 conditional knock-out (cKO) mice using a Nestin-Cre promotor, limiting ADAM10 inactivation to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and NPC-derived neurons and glial cells. The cKO mice die perinatally with a disrupted neocortex and a severely reduced ganglionic eminence, due to precocious neuronal differentiation resulting in an early depletion of progenitor cells. Premature neuronal differentiation is associated with aberrant neuronal migration and a disorganized laminar architecture in the neocortex. Neurospheres derived from Adam10 cKO mice have a disrupted sphere organization and segregated more neurons at the expense of astrocytes. We found that Notch-1 processing was affected, leading to downregulation of several Notch-regulated genes in Adam10 cKO brains, in accordance with the central role of ADAM10 in this signaling pathway and explaining the neurogenic phenotype. Finally, we found that alpha-secretase-mediated processing of APP was largely reduced in these neurons, demonstrating that ADAM10 represents the most important APP alpha-secretase in brain. Our study reveals that ADAM10 plays a central role in the developing brain by controlling mainly Notch-dependent pathways but likely also by reducing surface shedding of other neuronal membrane proteins including APP.",M1
20367756,"Transient focal cerebral ischemia significantly alters not only EAATs but also VGLUTs expression in rats: relevance of changes in reactive astroglia.The involvement of plasma membrane glutamate transporters (EAATs - excitatory aminoacid transporters) in the pathophysiology of ischemia has been widely studied, but little is known about the role of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) in the ischemic process. We analyzed the expression of VGLUT1-3 in the <e>cortex</e> and caudate-putamen of rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Western blot and immunohistochemistry revealed an increase of VGLUT1 signal in cortex and caudate-putamen until 3 days of reperfusion followed by a reduction 7 days after the ischemic insult. By contrast, VGLUT2 and 3 were drastically reduced. Confocal microscopy revealed an increase in VGLUT2 and 3 immunolabelling in the reactive astrocytes of the ischemic corpus callosum and cortex. Changes in VGLUTs and EAATs expression were differently correlated to neurological deficits. Interestingly, changes in VGLUT1 and EAAT2 expression showed a significant positive correlation in caudate-putamen. Taken together, these results suggest a contribution of VGLUTs to glutamate release in these structures, which could promote neuroblast migration and neurogenesis during ischemic recovery, and a possible interplay with EAATs in the regulation of glutamate levels, at least in the first stages of ischemic recovery.",M1

20362032,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain under mild hypothermia indicates changes in neuroprotection-related metabolites.Brain hypothermia has demonstrated pronounced neuroprotective effect in patients with cardiac arrest, ischemia and acute liver failure. However, its underlying neuroprotective mechanisms remain to be elucidated in order to improve therapeutic outcomes. Single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) was performed using a 7 Tesla MRI scanner on normal Sprague-Dawley rats (N=8) in the same voxel under normothermia (36.5 degrees C) and 30min mild hypothermia (33.5 degrees C). Levels of various brain proton metabolites were compared. The level of lactate (Lac) and myo-inositol (mI) increased in the <e>cortex</e> during hypothermia. In the thalamus, taurine (Tau), a cryogen in brain, increased and choline (Cho) decreased. These metabolic alterations indicated the onset of a number of neuroprotective processes that include attenuation of energy metabolism, excitotoxic pathways, brain osmolytes and thermoregulation, thus protecting neuronal cells from damage. These experimental findings demonstrated that (1)H-MRS can be applied to investigate the changes of specific metabolites and corresponding neuroprotection mechanisms in vivo noninvasively, and ultimately improve our basic understanding of hypothermia and ability to optimize its therapeutic efficacy.",M1

The purpose of this article was to examine a behavioral treatment sequence for such individuals intended to strengthen phonological processing and links between phonology and orthography, as well as train a means to maximize use of residual orthographic and phonological knowledge for spelling. METHOD: Two women with persistent impairments of written language and phonological processing following damage to left perisylvian cortical regions participated in this study. Both exhibited characteristic features of phonological alexia and agraphia in that reading and spelling performance for real words was better preserved than nonwords (lexicality effect). A 2-stage treatment protocol was administered to strengthen sublexical skills (phonological treatment) and to train interactive use of lexical and sublexical information to maximize spelling performance (interactive treatment). RESULTS: Both participants improved phonological processing abilities and reading/spelling via the sublexical route. They also improved spelling of real words and were able to detect and correct most residual errors using an electronic spelling aid. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral treatment served to strengthen phonological skills supporting reading and spelling, and provided a functional compensatory strategy to overcome residual weaknesses.",M1

20357179,"Neuronal death during combined intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia is due to mitochondrial dysfunction.Breathing-disordered states, such as in obstructive sleep apnea, which are cyclical in nature, have been postulated to induce neurocognitive morbidity in both pediatric and adult populations. The oscillatory nature of intermittent hypoxia, especially when chronic, may mimic the paradigm of ischemia-reperfusion in that tissues and cells are exposed to episodes of low and high O(2) and this may lead to oxidant stress. Therefore, we decided to explore the potential contribution of oxidant stress in our intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia animal model and the role that mitochondria might play in this stress. Neonatal mice were exposed to intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia for 10 days and 2 wk. Combined intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia led to a marked increase in apoptotic cell death in the cerebral <e>cortex</e>. Oxygen consumption studies in isolated mitochondria from intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia-exposed brains demonstrated significant reductions in both state 4 and state 3 respiratory activities by approximately 60% and 75%, respectively. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy registered a significant increase in superoxide production during nonphosphorylating state 4 by 37%, although superoxide leakage during state 3 did not increase upon treatment. Neuronal superoxide-specific dihydroethidium oxidation was also greater in exposed animals. These studies indicate that intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia leads to oxidative stress due to mitochondrial response within the mouse central nervous system.",M1
20357117,"Prospective isolation of cortical interneuron precursors from mouse embryonic stem cells.Despite their therapeutic potential, progress in generating fully differentiated forebrain neurons from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has lagged behind that from more caudal regions of the neuraxis.

We have modified a mouse ESC line with an Lhx6-GFP reporter construct that allows for the isolation of newly generated cortical interneuron precursors. When transplanted into postnatal cortex, these cells can migrate into the cortical parenchyma, survive for months, and display morphological, neurochemical, and electrophysiological properties characteristic of mature interneurons. This work demonstrates that forebrain neuronal subtypes with complex traits can be generated from embryonic stem cells, and provides a novel approach to the study of cortical interneuron development and to the establishment of cell-based therapies for neurological disease.",M1
20357110,"Loss of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in CA1 hippocampus and <e>cortex</e> impairs long-term depression, reduces dendritic spine density, and disrupts learning.NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are key mediators of certain forms of synaptic plasticity and learning. NMDAR complexes are heteromers composed of an obligatory GluN1 subunit and one or more GluN2 (GluN2A-GluN2D) subunits. Different subunits confer distinct physiological and molecular properties to NMDARs, but their contribution to synaptic plasticity and learning in the adult brain remains uncertain. Here, we generated mice lacking GluN2B in pyramidal neurons of cortex and CA1 subregion of hippocampus. We found that hippocampal principal neurons of adult GluN2B mutants had faster decaying NMDAR-mediated EPSCs than nonmutant controls and were insensitive to GluN2B but not NMDAR antagonism. A subsaturating form of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) was impaired in the mutants, whereas a saturating form of LTP was intact. An NMDAR-dependent form of long-term depression (LTD) produced by low-frequency stimulation combined with glutamate transporter inhibition was abolished in the mutants. Additionally, mutants exhibited decreased dendritic spine density in CA1 hippocampal neurons compared with controls. On multiple assays for corticohippocampal-mediated learning and memory (hidden platform Morris water maze, T-maze spontaneous alternation, and pavlovian trace fear conditioning), mutants were impaired. These data further demonstrate the importance of GluN2B for synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus and suggest a particularly critical role in LTD, at least the form studied here. The finding that loss of GluN2B was sufficient to cause learning deficits illustrates the contribution of GluN2B-mediated forms of plasticity to memory formation, with implications for elucidating NMDAR-related dysfunction in disease-related cognitive impairment.",M1
20353773,"The COX-2 inhibitor parecoxib is neuroprotective but not antiepileptogenic in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.The enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which catalyzes the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, is induced in the brain after various insults, thus contributing to brain inflammatory processes involved in the long-term consequences of such insults. Mounting evidence supports that inflammation may contribute to epileptogenesis and neuronal injury developing after brain insults. Anti-inflammatory treatments, such as selective COX-2 inhibitors, may thus constitute a novel approach for anti-epileptogenesis or disease-modification after brain injuries such as head trauma, cerebral ischemia or status epilepticus (SE). However, recent rat experiments with prophylactic administration of two different COX-2 inhibitors after SE resulted in conflicting results. In the present study, we evaluated whether treatment with parecoxib, a pro-drug of the highly potent and selective COX-2 inhibitor valdecoxib, alters the long-term consequences of a pilocarpine-induced SE in rats. Parecoxib was administered twice daily at 10 mg/kg for 18 days following SE. Five weeks after termination of treatment, spontaneous recurrent seizures were recorded by continuous video/EEG monitoring. Prophylactic treatment with parecoxib prevented the SE-induced increase in prostaglandin E(2) and reduced neuronal damage in the hippocampus and piriform <e>cortex</e>. However, the incidence, frequency or duration of spontaneous seizures developing after SE or the behavioral and cognitive alterations associated with epilepsy were not affected by parecoxib. Only the severity of spontaneous seizures was reduced, indicating a disease-modifying effect.

The  animal hypnosis  restored the  left  dominanta after its extinction. It was accompanied by formation of a new pattern of the cortical EEG coherence in the delta range, which was different from the patterns characteristic of each kind of dominanta. After the  animal hypnosis  session, the formation of the  left  dominanta produced two kinds of nonstable foci.

20352680,"[Initiation potential of the brain <e>cortex</e> before memory-guided saccades]Longer latency and duration of memory-guided saccades and their lower amplitude compared with visually-guided saccades testify to the slower programming of the former. Lateral distinctions in the latencies and durations of memory-guided and visually-guided saccades can reflect leading role of the right hemisphere in programming memory-guided saccades and leading role of the left hemisphere in programming visually-guided saccades. Topography and spatiotemporal dynamics of presaccadic potentials P-1 and N-1 within the last 100 ms of latent period suggest that the mechanisms of final stage of the programming of memory-guided and visually-guided saccades are different. Shorter latencies of the presaccadic P-1 and N-1 prior to memory-guided saccades testify to acceleration of the initiation of the memory-guided saccades. The acceleration of the initiation period of memory-guided saccades suggest that deceleration of memory-guided saccade programming occurs at the stages preceding saccade initiation.",M1
20348608,"Temporal coupling between stimulus-evoked neural activity and hemodynamic responses from individual cortical columns.Using previously published data from the whisker barrel <e>cortex</e> of anesthetized rodents (Berwick et al 2008 J. Neurophysiol. 99 787-98) we investigated whether highly spatially localized stimulus-evoked cortical hemodynamics responses displayed a linear time-invariant (LTI) relationship with neural activity. Presentation of stimuli to individual whiskers of 2 s and 16 s durations produced hemodynamics and neural activity spatially localized to individual cortical columns. Two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS) measured hemoglobin responses, while multi-laminar electrophysiology recorded neural activity. Hemoglobin responses to 2 s stimuli were deconvolved with underlying evoked neural activity to estimate impulse response functions which were then convolved with neural activity evoked by 16 s stimuli to generate predictions of hemodynamic responses. An LTI system more adequately described the temporal neuro-hemodynamics coupling relationship for these spatially localized sensory stimuli than in previous studies that activated the entire whisker cortex. An inability to predict the magnitude of an initial 'peak' in the total and oxy- hemoglobin responses was alleviated when excluding responses influenced by overlying arterial components. However, this did not improve estimation of the hemodynamic responses return to baseline post-stimulus cessation.",M1
20348416,"Af9/Mllt3 interferes with Tbr1 expression through epigenetic modification of histone H3K79 during development of the cerebral <e>cortex</e>.Mutations of leukemia-associated AF9/MLLT3 are implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases, such as epilepsy and ataxia, but little is known about how AF9 influences brain development and function. Analyses of mouse mutants revealed that during cortical development, AF9 is involved in the maintenance of TBR2-positive progenitors (intermediate precursor cells, IPCs) in the subventricular zone and prevents premature cell cycle exit of IPCs. Furthermore, in postmitotic neurons of the developing cortical plate, AF9 is implicated in the formation of the six-layered cerebral cortex by suppressing a TBR1-positive cell fate mainly in upper layer neurons. We show that the molecular mechanism of TBR1 suppression is based on the interaction of AF9 with DOT1L, a protein that mediates transcriptional control through methylation of histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). AF9 associates with the transcriptional start site of Tbr1, mediates H3K79 dimethylation of the Tbr1 gene, and interferes with the presence of RNA polymerase II at the Tbr1 transcriptional start site. AF9 expression favors cytoplasmic localization of TBR1 and its association with mitochondria. Increased expression of TBR1 in Af9 mutants is associated with increased levels of TBR1-regulated expression of NMDAR subunit Nr1. Thus, this study identified AF9 as a developmental active epigenetic modifier during the generation of cortical projection neurons.",M1
20346766,"Separable learning systems in the macaque brain and the role of orbitofrontal <e>cortex</e> in contingent learning.Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is widely held to be critical for flexibility in decision-making when established choice values change. OFC's role in such decision making was investigated in macaques performing dynamically changing three-armed bandit tasks. After selective OFC lesions, animals were impaired at discovering the identity of the highest value stimulus following reversals. However, this was not caused either by diminished behavioral flexibility or by insensitivity to reinforcement changes, but instead by paradoxical increases in switching between all stimuli. This pattern of choice behavior could be explained by a causal role for OFC in appropriate contingent learning, the process by which causal responsibility for a particular reward is assigned to a particular choice. After OFC lesions, animals' choice behavior no longer reflected the history of precise conjoint relationships between particular choices and particular rewards. Nonetheless, OFC-lesioned animals could still approximate choice-outcome associations using a recency-weighted history of choices and rewards.",M1

20345753,"Neonatal exposure to estradiol in rats influences neuroactive steroid concentrations, GABAA receptor expression, and behavioral sensitivity to anxiolytic drugs.Gonadal steroids, in particular estradiol, exert important actions during pre- and perinatal periods in the regulation of sexual dimorphism and development of the nervous system. We have now examined the effects of neonatal estradiol administration in female rats on brain concentrations of the neuroactive steroids allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits, and behavioral sensitivity to benzodiazepines and allopregnanolone. Administration of beta-estradiol 3-benzoate on the day of birth resulted in marked decreases in the concentrations of progesterone and allopregnanolone in the cerebral <e>cortex</e> at 21, 60, and 180 days after birth. The concentrations of tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, 17beta-estradiol, and dehydroepiandrosterone in the brain at 60 days were not affected by such treatment. Neonatal administration of beta-estradiol 3-benzoate also increased the cerebrocortical abundance of alpha(1), alpha(2), and gamma(2) subunits of the GABA(A) receptor without affecting that of alpha(3), alpha(4), alpha(5), or delta subunits. Diazepam induced a greater reduction in locomotor activity as well as a more pronounced anxiolytic-like effect in the elevated plus-maze test in rats subjected to neonatal treatment with beta-estradiol 3-benzoate than in vehicle-treated controls, while allopregnanolone induced a similar effect in both groups. These effects of estradiol suggest that it plays a major role in regulation both of GABAergic transmission and of the abundance of endogenous modulators of such transmission during development of the central nervous system.",M1
20335480,"The subthreshold relation between cortical local field potential and neuronal firing unveiled by intracellular recordings in awake rats.In most of the in vivo electrophysiological studies of cortical processing, which are extracellular, the spike-triggered local field potential average (LFP STA) is the measure used to estimate the correlation between the synaptic inputs of individual neuron and the local population. To understand how the magnitude and shape of LFP STA reflect the underlying correlation of synaptic activities, the membrane potential of the firing neuron has to be recorded together with the LFP. Using intracellular recordings from the <e>cortex</e> of awake rats, we found that for a large range of firing rates and for different behavioral states, the LFP STA represents both in its waveform and its magnitude the cross-correlation between the membrane potential of the neuron and the LFP. This data, supported by further analysis, suggests that LFP STA does not represent large network events specific to the spike times, but rather the synchrony between the mean synaptic activity of the population and the membrane potential of the single neuron, present both around spike times and in the intervals between spikes. Furthermore, it introduces a novel interpretation of the available data from unit and LFP extracellular recording experiments.",M1
20335477,"Preferential localization of muscarinic M1 receptor on dendritic shaft and spine of cortical pyramidal cells and its anatomical evidence for volume transmission.Acetylcholine (ACh) plays important roles for higher brain functions, including arousal, attention, and cognition. These effects are mediated largely by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). However, it remains inconclusive whether the mode of ACh-mAChR signaling is synaptic, so-called  wired,  transmission mediated by ACh released into the synaptic cleft, or nonsynaptic, so-called  volume,  transmission by ambient ACh. To address this issue, we examined cellular and subcellular distribution of M(1), the most predominant mAChR subtype in the cerebral <e>cortex</e> and hippocampus, and pursued its anatomical relationship with cholinergic varicosities in these regions of adult mice. M(1) was highly expressed in glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, whereas it was low or undetectable in various GABAergic interneuron subtypes. M(1) was preferentially distributed on the extrasynaptic membrane of pyramidal cell dendrites and spines. Cholinergic varicosities often made direct contact to pyramidal cell dendrites and synapses. At such contact sites, however, synapse-like specialization was infrequent, and no particular accumulation was found at around contact sites for both M(1) and presynpatic active zone protein Bassoon. These features contrasted with those of the glutamatergic system, in which AMPA receptor GluA2 and metabotropic receptor mGluR5 were recruited to the synaptic or perisynaptic membrane, respectively, and Bassoon was highly accumulated in the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that M(1) is so positioned to sense ambient ACh released from cholinergic varicosities at variable distances, and to enhance the synaptic efficacy and excitability of pyramidal cells. These molecular-anatomical arrangements will provide the evidence for volume transmission, at least in M(1)-mediated cortical cholinergic signaling.",M1

Functional imaging of this neurotransmitter system may provide novel opportunities in the diagnosis and evaluation of cognitive disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal activation patterns of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) stimulation in rat brain with pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI). We performed blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI and contrast-enhanced cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted MRI combined with injection of pilocarpine, a non-selective mAChR agonist. BOLD and CBV responses were assessed after pretreatment with methyl-scopolamine in order to block peripheral muscarinic effects. Region-of-interest analysis in individual animals and group-level independent component analysis failed to show significant BOLD signal changes following pilocarpine injection. However, with contrast-enhanced CBV-weighted MRI, positive CBV responses were detected in the cerebral <e>cortex</e>, thalamus, and hippocampus whereas a negative CBV response was observed in the striatum. Thus, pilocarpine-induced significant activation responses in brain regions that are known to have a high density of muscarinic receptors.

B., 1979: Shvets-Teneta-Gurii T. B., 1986; Shvets-Teneta-Gurii T. B., 1986 et al., 2002]. The gist of this line consists of the simultaneous multipoint measuring local changes in the cerebral cortex redox potential (the E) in animals. Polygraphic recordings of the the E, electrocorticogram (ECoG) and general motor activity were made in sleep-wakefulness cycles of rats. It has been found that transition of rats to slow wave sleep (SWS) was accompanied by the E lowering in the metabolic active sites and by arising compound oscillations in the E. At the same time, irregular periodic weak winces (3-40-sec apart) appeared and were accompanied by the ECoG activation and by the E decrease. There are data that episodes of the ECoG activation in SWS are accompanied by pO2 drops in the brain structures [Sarkisova K. Yu., Kolomeitseva I. A., 1900]. Visual and acoustic stimulation being presented in human slow-wave sleep brings down the brain oxygenation level [Born A. P. et al., 2002; Czisch M. et al., 2002]. In sum, the given facts indicate an increase in the activity of functional units in SWS that are fueled by glycolytic compartment. Recently published data suggest that the astroglia is the major compartment of aerobic glycolysis [Dienel G. A., Cruz N. F., 2006; Magistretti P. J., 2006]. It can be speculated that astroglia plays the especially important part in events taking place during SWS.",M1

Although lesion studies have demonstrated the involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in impulsive action, the precise brain sites responsible for nicotine-induced impulsive action have not been identified. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to determine whether alpha4beta2 nAChRs in the prelimbic cortex (PL) and/or infralimbic cortex (IL), which are subregions of the mPFC, mediate nicotine-induced impulsive-like action in the three-choice serial reaction time task (3-CSRTT). METHODS: The 3-CSRTT is a simple version of five-choice serial reaction time task and a rodent model of impulsive action in which the animal is required to inhibit the response until a light stimulus is presented randomly in one of three holes. Following the completion of the training, rats were bilaterally injected with dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE; 6 and 18 microg/side), a selective alpha4beta2 nAChRs antagonist, into the PL or IL before systemic injection of nicotine (0.2 mg/kg, salt, s.c.). RESULTS: Intra-IL DHbetaE infusions dose-dependently blocked nicotine-induced impulsive-like action, while infusions of DHbetaE into the PL failed to block the effects of nicotine on impulsive-like action. CONCLUSION: The present results suggest a critical role for alpha4beta2 nAChRs in the IL in mediating the effects of nicotine on impulsive-like action in the 3-CSRTT.",M1
20237276,"Identification of a Smad4/YY1-recognized and BMP2-responsive transcriptional regulatory module in the promoter of mouse GABA transporter subtype I (Gat1) gene.GABAergic dysfunction is implicated in a variety of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The mechanisms underlying GABAergic differentiation, however, are not well understood. GABA transporter 1 (Gat1; Slc6a1) is an essential component of the GABAergic system, and its ectopic mRNA expression may be responsible for GABAergic malfunction under different pathological conditions. Thus, monitoring the transcriptional regulation of gat1 may help to elucidate the mechanisms that govern the differentiation of GABAergic neurons. In this study, we identified a promoter region that is sufficient to recapitulate endogenous gat1 expression in transgenic mice. A 46 bp cis-regulator in the promoter sequence was responsible for the stimulation of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) on gat1 expression in cortical <e>cortex</e>. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that Smad4 and YY1 are physically bound to the element and mediate both the negative and positive regulatory effects in which BMP2 can affect the balance. In summary, we have identified a Smad4/YY1-based bidirectional regulation model for GABAergic gene transcription and demonstrated a molecular cue important for the differentiation of GABAergic neurons.",M1
20237272,"Repression of Fgf signaling by sprouty1-2 regulates cortical patterning in two distinct regions and times.A fundamental question in developmental biology is how signaling pathways establish a transcription factor code that controls cell proliferation, regional fate and cell fate. Morphogenesis of the rostral telencephalon is controlled in part by Fgf signaling from the rostral patterning center. How Fgf signaling is regulated in the telencephalon is critical for understanding cerebral <e>cortex</e> formation. Here we show that mouse Sprouty1 and Sprouty2 (Spry1-2), which encode negative feedback regulators of Fgf signaling, are affecting cortical proliferation, differentiation, and the expression of genes regulating progenitor identity in the ventricular zone. In addition, Spry2 has a later function in regulating the MAPK pathway, proliferation, and gene expression in the cortex at mid-neurogenesis. Finally, we provide evidence that Coup-TFI, a transcription factor that promotes caudal fate, does so through repressing Fgf signaling, in part by promoting Spry expression.",M1
20237271,"Dyrk1A overexpression inhibits proliferation and induces premature neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells.Dyrk1A is a member of the mammalian Dyrk [dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase] family of protein kinases that is expressed at high levels in the brain, but its role in the development and function of this organ is not well understood. The human DYRK1A gene is located on trisomic chromosome 21 in Down syndrome (DS) patients, leading to its overexpression. Dyrk1A is also overexpressed in animal models of DS and in gene-specific transgenic mice that consistently exhibit cognitive impairment. To elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are affected by increased levels of Dyrk1A in the developing brain, we overexpressed this kinase in the embryonic mouse neocortex using the in utero electroporation technique. We found that Dyrk1A overexpression inhibits neural cell proliferation and promotes premature neuronal differentiation in the developing cerebral <e>cortex</e> without affecting cell fate and layer positioning. These effects are dependent on the Dyrk1A kinase activity and are mediated by the nuclear export and degradation of cyclin D1. This study identifies specific Dyrk1A-induced mechanisms that disrupt the normal process of corticogenesis and possibly contribute to cognitive impairment observed in DS patients and animal models.",M1
20237268,"Sertad1 plays an essential role in developmental and pathological neuron death.Developmental and pathological death of neurons requires activation of a defined pathway of cell cycle proteins. However, it is unclear how this pathway is regulated and whether it is relevant in vivo. A screen for transcripts robustly induced in cultured neurons by DNA damage identified Sertad1, a Cdk4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4) activator. Sertad1 is also induced in neurons by nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation and Abeta (beta-amyloid). RNA interference-mediated downregulation of Sertad1 protects neurons in all three death models. Studies of NGF withdrawal indicate that Sertad1 is required to initiate the apoptotic cell cycle pathway since its knockdown blocks subsequent pathway events. Finally, we find that Sertad1 expression is required for developmental neuronal death in the cerebral <e>cortex</e>. Sertad1 thus appears to be essential for neuron death in trophic support deprivation in vitro and in vivo and in models of DNA damage and Alzheimer's disease. It may therefore be a suitable target for therapeutic intervention.",M1
20237263,"Loss of HRD1-mediated protein degradation causes amyloid precursor protein accumulation and amyloid-beta generation.Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is a system by which proteins accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are retrotranslocated to the cytosol and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. HRD1 is expressed in brain neurons and acts as an ERAD ubiquitin ligase. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed into amyloid-beta peptides (Abetas) that form plaque deposits in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. We found significantly decreased HRD1 protein levels in the cerebral <e>cortex</e> of AD patients. HRD1 colocalized with APP in brain neurons and interacted with APP through the proline-rich region of HRD1. HRD1 promoted APP ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in decreased generation of Abeta. Furthermore, suppression of HRD1 expression induced APP accumulation that led to increased production of Abeta associated with ER stress. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that suppression of HRD1 expression inhibited APP aggresome formation, resulting in apoptosis. In addition, we found that the ATF6- and XBP1-induced upregulation of ERAD led to APP degradation and reduced Abeta production. These results suggest that the breakdown of HRD1-mediated ERAD causes Abeta generation and ER stress, possibly linked to AD.",M1
20230753,"Cortical neural precursors inhibit their own differentiation via N-cadherin maintenance of beta-catenin signaling.Little is known about the architecture of cellular microenvironments that support stem and precursor cells during tissue development. Although adult stem cell niches are organized by specialized supporting cells, in the developing cerebral <e>cortex</e>, neural stem/precursor cells reside in a neurogenic niche lacking distinct supporting cells. Here, we find that neural precursors themselves comprise the niche and regulate their own development. Precursor-precursor contact regulates beta-catenin signaling and cell fate. In vivo knockdown of N-cadherin reduces beta-catenin signaling, migration from the niche, and neuronal differentiation in vivo. N-cadherin engagement activates beta-catenin signaling via Akt, suggesting a mechanism through which cells in tissues can regulate their development. These results suggest that neural precursor cell interactions can generate a self-supportive niche to regulate their own number.",M1
20230727,"Fluoxetine might alleviate brain damage and hypercortisolemia related to chronic alcohol in rats.OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were (a) to investigate the neuropathological damage in brain regions and changes of corticosteroid concentrations related to chronic alcohol administration, (b) to see what effect fluoxetine (Prozac) has on the neuropathological damage and corticosteroid levels, and (c) to evaluate the potential association between neuropathological damage and changes of corticosteroid levels. METHOD: Rats were randomly divided into alcohol and control groups, with the former given ethanol intraperitoneally for 8 weeks; corticosterone levels were measured in both groups. Thereafter, fluoxetine hydrochloride or saline was injected into the animals. The rats were sacrificed and the number of neurons in five regions of the cerebral <e>cortex</e> was determined. RESULTS: The numbers of neurons in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus of the alcoholic group treated with saline were significantly reduced compared with the control group treated with saline. The number of neurons observed in CA3 regions of the hippocampal cortex of the alcoholic group treated with fluoxetine was significantly increased compared with the alcoholic group treated with saline. Corticosteroid levels of the alcoholic group treated with saline were significantly increased compared with the control group. Corticosteroid levels of the alcoholic group treated with fluoxetine were obviously reduced compared with the alcoholic group treated with saline. The number of neurons in the CA3 regions of the hippocampus was adversely associated with corticosteroid levels. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic alcohol administration induced selective loss of neurons in different brain regions and increased corticosteroid concentrations. Fluoxetine may have alleviated neuronal loss in the hippocampus and attenuated hypercortisolemia related to alcohol.",M1
20226773,"Mental representations of action: the neural correlates of the verbal and motor components.Recent theories have hypothesized that semantic representations of action verbs and mental representations of action may be supported by partially overlapping, distributed brain networks. An fMRI experiment in healthy participants was designed to identify the common and specific regions in three different tasks from a common set of object drawings (manipulable man-made objects (MMO) and biological objects (MBO)): the generation of action words (GenA), the mental simulation of action (MSoA) and the mime of an action with the right hand (MimA). A fourth task, object naming (ON), was used as control for input/output effects. A null conjunction identified a common neural network consisting of nine regions distributed over premotor, parietal and occipital cortices. Within this common network, GenA elicited significantly more activation than either ON or MSoA in the left inferior frontal region, while MSoA elicited significantly more activation than either ON or GenA in the left superior parietal lobule. Both MSoA and GenA activated the left inferior parietal lobule more than ON. Furthermore, the left superior parietal <e>cortex</e> was activated to a greater extent by MMO than by MBO regardless of the tasks. These results suggest that action-denoting verbs and motor representations of the same actions activate a common frontal-parietal network. The left inferior parietal cortex and the left superior parietal cortex are likely to be involved in the retrieval of spatial-temporal features of object manipulation; the former might relate to the grasping and manipulation of any object while the latter might be linked to specific object-related gestures.",M1
20226182,"The relationship between sudden severe hypoxia and ischemia-associated spreading depolarization in adult rat brainstem in vivo.Severe ischemia can induce spreading depolarization (SD) in the cerebral <e>cortex</e>, which is thought to contribute significantly to cerebral dysfunction. Whether the mature brainstem shows SD upon reduced oxygen supply has not been investigated although SDs may significantly influence brainstem functions. In anesthetized adult rats, we induced severe short-lasting hypoxia (SSH) by stopping artificial respiration for about 1 min or by ventilation with pure nitrogen for 1, 2 or 3 min, and milder hypoxia by ventilation with 6% O(2) in N(2) for 10 min. We measured DC potentials in the brainstem and cerebral cortex, systemic arterial blood pressure, heart rate and local blood flow at the brainstem or cerebral cortex surface. SSH lasting up to 1 min did not induce DC shifts in native brainstem but reduced heart rate, systemic blood pressure and blood flow in cortex and brainstem. Longer lasting SSH protocols both reduced systemic blood pressure and induced SD in the brainstem, but the magnitude of the cardiovascular response was not influenced by the simultaneous occurrence of SD. When neuronal excitability in the brainstem was artificially enhanced, SSH of 1 min evoked SD but again the magnitude of cardiovascular changes during SSH was not increased. SSH lasting 3 min evoked non-reversible sustained depolarization. SSH did not render the brainstem more excitable for classical SD evoked by local KCl application. Thus, sudden severe hypoxia/ischemia evokes SDs in the brainstem, but the occurrence of the so-elicited SD does not influence the immediate cardiovascular response to SSH.",M1
20223196,"A possible role for the striatum in the pathogenesis of the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are largely resistant to current treatment and are thus a life-long burden of the illness. Studies of cognitive symptoms have commonly focused on prefrontal <e>cortex</e> because of its demonstrated importance for executive function and working memory--key components of the deficit. The role of striatal-cortical circuitry and therefore the striatum itself has received much less attention. Here we review longstanding evidence that the striatum and its cortical connections are critical for complex cognition and discuss emerging evidence of the striatum's potential involvement in cognitive symptoms. Finally, we suggest how mouse models might test ideas about the contribution of early striatal dysfunction to the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.",M1
20220008,"Mirrored bilateral slow-wave cortical activity within local circuits revealed by fast bihemispheric voltage-sensitive dye imaging in anesthetized and awake mice.Spontaneous slow-wave oscillations of neuronal membrane potential occur about once every second in the rodent <e>cortex</e> and may serve to shape the efficacy of evoked neuronal responses and consolidate memory during sleep. However, whether these oscillations reflect the entrainment of all cortical regions via propagating waves or whether they exhibit regional and temporal heterogeneity that reflects processing in local cortical circuits is unknown. Using voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging within an adult C57BL/6J mouse cross-midline large craniotomy preparation, we recorded this depolarizing activity across most of both cortical hemispheres simultaneously in both anesthetized and quiet awake animals. Spontaneous oscillations in the VSD signal were highly synchronized between hemispheres, and acallosal I/LnJ mice indicated that synchrony depended on the corpus callosum. In both anesthetized and awake mice (recovered from anesthesia), the oscillations were not necessarily global changes in activity state but were made up of complex local patterns characterized by multiple discrete peaks that were unevenly distributed across cortex. Although the local patterns of depolarizing activity were complex and changed over tens of milliseconds, they were faithfully mirrored in both hemispheres in mice with an intact corpus callosum, to perhaps ensure parallel modification of related circuits in both hemispheres. We conclude that within global rhythms of spontaneous activity are complex events that reflect orchestrated processing within local cortical circuits.",M1
20220007,"Functional dissociation of the frontoinsular and anterior cingulate cortices in empathy for pain.The frontoinsular <e>cortex</e> (FI) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are thought to be involved in empathy for others' pain. However, the functional roles of FI and ACC in empathetic responses have not yet been clearly dissociated in previous studies. In this study, participants viewed color photographs depicting human body parts in painful or nonpainful situations and performed either pain judgment (painful/nonpainful) or laterality judgment (left/right) of the body parts. We found that activation of FI, rather than ACC, showed significant increase for painful compared with nonpainful images, regardless of the task requirement. Our data suggest a clear functional dissociation between FI and ACC in which FI is more domain-specific than ACC when processing empathy for pain.",M1
20219642,"Met158 variant of the catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype is associated with thicker <e>cortex</e> in adult brain.Cortical thickness has been proposed as a new promising brain imaging endophenotype in elucidating the nature of gene-brain relationships. Here, we define the morphological impact of the Val(158)Met polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene on human brain anatomy. One hundred and forty-nine adult healthy subjects (mean age: 40.7+/-16.1; ranging from 19 to 76 years) were genotyped (38 in the homozygous Val(158) group; 80 in the Val(158)Met group; 31 in the homozygous Met(158) group) for the COMT polymorphism and underwent morphological examination. Surface-based analysis of the cortical mantle showed that the COMT genotype was associated with structural differences in the right superior temporal sulcus and inferior prefrontal sulcus, where the individuals carrying the Met(158) allele had a thicker cortex with respect to their Val(158) counterparts. Our study extends the previous evidence found on pediatric population to the adult population, demonstrating that the higher synaptic dopamine levels associated with the presence of the Met(158) allele may influence neuronal architecture in brain structures important for executive and emotional processing.",M1
20219628,"Systemic administration of catalpol prevents D-galactose induced mitochondrial dysfunction in mice.The aim of this work was to evaluate the mechanisms involved in the effects of catalpol on mitochondrial function through the measurements of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, respiratory complex activities and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in the brain <e>cortex</e> and hippocampus mitochondria of senescent mice induced by d-galactose. Except control group, mice were subcutaneously injected with d-galactose (150 mg/kg body weight) for 6 weeks. Meanwhile, drug group mice were treated with catalpol (2.5, 5, 10mg/kg body weight) and piracetam (300 mg/kg body weight) for the last 2 weeks. The results indicated that respiratory complex activities decreased while NOS activities increased in d-galactose treated mice brain. The production of ROS increased remarkably and MMP collapsed in the brain of senescent mice induced by d-galactose. Administration of catalpol for 2 weeks significantly decreased ROS production and NOS activities, in accordance with its increase on complex activities and MMP level. Our results suggest that in vivo effects of catalpol on mitochondrial function can occur through different mechanisms, involving inhibiting NOS activity and ROS production, increasing respiratory complex activities and MMP level.",M1
20217101,"Accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta correlates with ApoE4 genotype.In contrast to extracellular plaque and intracellular tangle pathology, the presence and relevance of intraneuronal Abeta in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still a matter of debate. Human brain tissue offers technical challenges such as post-mortem delay and uneven or prolonged tissue fixation that might affect immunohistochemical staining. In addition, previous studies on intracellular Abeta accumulation in human brain often used antibodies targeting the C-terminus of Abeta and differed strongly in the pretreatments used. To overcome these inconsistencies, we performed extensive parametrical testing using a highly specific N-terminal Abeta antibody detecting the aspartate at position 1, before developing an optimal staining protocol for intraneuronal Abeta detection in paraffin-embedded sections from AD patients. To rule out that this antibody also detects the beta-cleaved APP C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF, C99) bearing the same epitope, paraffin-sections of transgenic mice overexpressing the C99-fragment were stained without any evidence for cross-reactivity in our staining protocol. The staining intensity of intraneuronal Abeta in <e>cortex</e> and hippocampal tissue of 10 controls and 20 sporadic AD cases was then correlated to patient data including sex, Braak stage, plaque load, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. In particular, the presence of one or two ApoE4 alleles strongly correlated with an increased accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta peptides. Given that ApoE4 is a major genetic risk factor for AD and is involved in neuronal cholesterol transport, it is tempting to speculate that perturbed intracellular trafficking is involved in the increased intraneuronal Abeta aggregation in AD.",M1
20215749,"Treatment effects of therapeutic cholinesterase inhibitors on visuospatial processing in Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal functional MRI study.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Visuospatial impairments are known to occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesised that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response in task-related brain regions would be impaired in patients with AD during the task and that treatment with acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors would enhance activations in brain regions concerned with this visual perceptual processing. METHOD: Ten AD subjects were neuropsychologically assessed and underwent fMRI imaging whilst performing a series of visuospatial perception tasks, before and after treatment with acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors. Eleven healthy elderly comparison subjects were also scanned twice. RESULTS: Regions of increased brain activation in AD included the left precuneus, left cuneus, left supramarginal gyrus, right parieto-temporal <e>cortex</e> and right inferior parietal lobule. Further, increased activation in the left precuneus was found to correlate significantly with improved functioning of activities of daily living. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this to be the first fMRI study that, after controlling for the confound of repeat scanning, demonstrates altered patterns of brain activation associated with visuospatial processing following treatment in patients with AD. The treatment-related improvement of visual perception in AD may rely on enhanced attentional mechanisms, thereby possibly supporting independent living through improvement on activities of daily living.",M1
20213269,"Changes in dendritic complexity and spine morphology in transgenic mice expressing human wild-type tau.Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are composed of insoluble, hyperphosphorylated aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau and are present in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate how tau affects neuronal function during NFT formation and subsequent neurodegeneration, we examined the morphology, spine density, spine type, and spine volume of layer III pyramidal neurons from the prefrontal <e>cortex</e> of mice expressing wild-type human tau (htau) over time. There were no significant alterations in apical dendritic arbor length in 3-, 6-, and 12-month-old htau mice; however, 12-month-old mice exhibited more complex arborization patterns. In addition, we observed a shift in spine morphology with fewer mushroom and more thin spines in both apical and basal dendrites as a function of htau accumulation. Interestingly, there was an overall decrease in volume of spines from 3 to 12 months. However, the volume of mushroom spines decreased from 3 to 6 months and increased from 6 to 12 months. This increase in complexity and branching in 12-month-old mice and the increase of volume of mushroom spines may represent compensatory mechanisms in the remaining intact neurons. As such, the accumulation of phosphorylated tau over time may contribute to the cognitive decline observed in AD by affecting neuronal structure and synaptic properties. Such alterations in dendrites and spines may result in the deterioration of neuronal function observed in AD, and provide a morphologic substrate for the relationship between synaptic integrity and cognitive decline.",M1
20211971,"Thyroid hormone-regulated mouse cerebral <e>cortex</e> genes are differentially dependent on the source of the hormone: a study in monocarboxylate transporter-8- and deiodinase-2-deficient mice.Thyroid hormones influence brain development through the control of gene expression. The concentration of the active hormone T(3) in the brain depends on T(3) transport through the blood-brain barrier, mediated in part by the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (Mct8/MCT8) and the activity of type 2 deiodinase (D2) generating T(3) from T(4). The relative roles of each of these pathways in the regulation of brain gene expression is not known. To shed light on this question, we analyzed thyroid hormone-dependent gene expression in the cerebral cortex of mice with inactivated Mct8 (Slc16a2) and Dio2 genes, alone or in combination. We used 34 target genes identified to be controlled by thyroid hormone in microarray comparisons of cerebral cortex from wild-type control and hypothyroid mice on postnatal d 21. Inactivation of the Mct8 gene (Mct8KO) was without effect on the expression of 31 of these genes. Normal gene expression in the absence of the transporter was mostly due to D2 activity because the combined disruption of Mct8 and Dio2 led to similar effects as hypothyroidism on the expression of 24 genes. Dio2 disruption alone did not affect the expression of positively regulated genes, but, as in hypothyroidism, it increased that of negatively regulated genes. We conclude that gene expression in the Mct8KO cerebral cortex is compensated in part by D2-dependent mechanisms. Intriguingly, positive or negative regulation of genes by thyroid hormone is sensitive to the source of T(3) because Dio2 inactivation selectively affects the expression of negatively regulated genes.",M1
20210878,"Cortical processing of near-threshold tactile stimuli: an MEG study.In the present study we tested the applicability of a paired-stimulus paradigm for the investigation of near-threshold (NT) stimulus processing in the somatosensory system using magnetoencephalography. Cortical processing of the NT stimuli was studied indirectly by investigating the impact of NT stimuli on the source activity of succeeding suprathreshold test stimuli. We hypothesized that cortical responses evoked by test stimuli are reduced due to the preactivation of the same finger representation by the preceding NT stimulus. We observed attenuation of the magnetic responses in the secondary somatosensory (SII) <e>cortex</e>, with stronger decreases for perceived than for missed NT stimuli.

20207347,"Effects of the alpha4beta2 partial agonist varenicline on brain activity and working memory in abstinent smokers.BACKGROUND: Cognitive alterations are a core symptom of nicotine withdrawal, contributing to smoking relapse. In rodents and humans, cognitive deficits can be reversed by treatment with the alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor partial agonist varenicline. This neuroimaging study examined the neural mechanisms that underlie these effects. METHODS: Twenty-two smokers completed 13 days of varenicline and placebo treatment in a double-blind crossover study with two functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions: after 3 days of abstinence while on varenicline and after 3 days of abstinence while on placebo (counterbalanced randomized order, 2-week washout). Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) data were acquired during performance of a visual N-back working memory task. RESULTS: In a region of interest analysis, significant effects of treatment on mean percent signal change (varenicline &gt; placebo) were observed in the dorsal anterior cingulate/medial frontal <e>cortex</e>, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In a cross-region model, there was a significant interaction of treatment by memory load, indicating significant increases in BOLD signal for varenicline versus placebo at the 2-back and 3-back levels but not the 1-back level. Varenicline improved performance (correct response time) in highly dependent smokers with no effect among less dependent smokers. In highly dependent smokers, faster correct response time was associated with increased BOLD signal. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence that the alpha4beta2 partial agonist varenicline increases working memory-related brain activity after 3 days of nicotine abstinence, particularly at high levels of task difficulty, with associated improvements in cognitive performance among highly dependent smokers.",M1

Occupational exposure to noise may result in health disorders. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of chronic exposure to high-intensity noise of textile industry cotton rooms on the adrenal morphology. The environmental noise of a cotton-mill room from a large textile factory of Northern Portugal was recorded and reproduced by an adopted electroacoustic setup in a sound-insulated animal room where the rats were housed. The sounds were reproduced at the original levels of approximately 92 dB, which was achieved by equalization and distribution of sound output in the room. Wistar rats were submitted to noise exposure, in the same time schedule as employed in textile plants. After one, three, five, and seven months, the adrenals were collected and analyzed by light microscopy. Analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons of the means between the groups. Noise exposure induced time-dependent changes in adrenal cortex, with decrease of zona fasciculata (ZF) and increase of zona reticularis volumes, together with a significant depletion of lipid droplet density in ZF cells of exposed rats, in comparison to control rats. Chronic exposure of rats to textile industry noise triggers cytological changes in the adrenals that suggest the existence of a sustained stress response.",M2
19063937,"New genes and/or molecular pathways associated with adrenal hyperplasias and related adrenocortical tumors.Over the course of the last 10 years, we have studied the genetic and molecular mechanisms leading to disorders that affect the adrenal <e>cortex</e>, with emphasis on those that are developmental, hereditary and associated with adrenal hypoplasia or hyperplasia, multiple tumors and abnormalities in other endocrine glands. On the basis of this work, we propose an hypothesis on how adrenocortical tumors form and the importance of the cyclic AMP-dependent signaling pathway in this process. The regulatory subunit type 1-alpha (RIalpha) of protein kinase A (PKA) (the PRKAR1A gene) is mutated in most patients with Carney complex and primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD). Phosphodiesterase-11A (the PDE11A gene) and -8B (the PDE8B gene) mutations were found in patients with isolated adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing syndrome, as well in patients with PPNAD. PKA effects on tumor suppression and/or development and the cell cycle are becoming clear: PKA and/or cAMP act as a coordinator of growth and proliferation in the adrenal cortex. Mouse models in which the respective genes have been knocked out see m to support this notion. Genome-wide searches for other genes responsible for adrenal tumors and related diseases are ongoing; recent evidece of the involvement of the mitochondrial oxidation pathway in adrenocortical tumorigenesis is derived from our study of rare associations such as those of disorders predisposing to adrenomedullary and related tumors (Carney triad, the dyad of paragangliomas and gastric stromal sarcomas or Carney-Stratakis syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer syndrome) which appear to be associated with adrenocortical lesions.",M2

We aimed to evaluate the potential role of sex steroids in the susceptibility of women to adrenocortical tumors. We evaluated the presence of the progesterone receptor (PR), estradiol receptors (ERs), and aromatase in 5 patients with primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease (PPNAD), 15 adrenocortical adenomas (ACAs) and adjacent normal tissues, 12 adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs), and 3 normal adrenal glands (NA). The expression of PR and ERalpha was evaluated by enzyme immunoassays, real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and cytosol-based ligand-binding assays. ERbeta and aromatase levels were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. ERalpha concentrations were low in NA, in adrenal tissues adjacent to ACA (51+/-33), in ACC (53+/-78), and lower in ACA (11+/-11 fmol/mg DNA). Conversely, PR concentrations were high in NA and adrenal tissues adjacent to ACA, at 307+/-216 fmol/mg DNA, and were even higher in tumors - 726+/-706 fmol/mg DNA in ACA and 1154+/-1586 fmol/mg DNA in ACC - and in isolated PPNAD nodules. Binding study results in four tumors were compatible with binding to a steroid receptor. In patients with PPNAD, a strong positive immunohistochemical signal was associated with the sole isolated nodular regions. ERbeta transcript levels were very high in all samples except those for two ACCs, whereas aromatase levels were low. PR and ERbeta are clearly present in normal adrenal glands and adrenal tumors. Further studies may shed light on the possible pathogenic role of these receptors in adrenal proliferation.",M2
18431404,"A cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE8B) that is mutated in adrenal hyperplasia is expressed widely in human and mouse tissues: a novel PDE8B isoform in human adrenal <e>cortex</e>.Bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia (BAH) is the second most common cause of corticotropin-independent Cushing syndrome (CS). Genetic forms of BAH have been associated with complex syndromes such as Carney Complex and McCune-Albright syndrome or may present as isolated micronodular adrenocortical disease (iMAD) usually in children and young adults with CS. A genome-wide association study identified inactivating phosphodiesterase (PDE) 11A (PDE11A)-sequencing defects as low-penetrance predisposing factors for iMAD and related abnormalities; we also described a mutation (c.914A &gt; C/H305P) in cyclic AMP (cAMP)-specific PDE8B, in a patient with iMAD. In this study we further characterize this mutation; we also found a novel PDE8B isoform that is highly expressed in the adrenal gland. This mutation is shown to significantly affect the ability of the protein to degrade cAMP in vitro. Tumor tissues from patients with iMAD and no mutations in the coding PDE8B sequence or any other related genes (PRKAR1A, PDE11A) showed downregulated PDE8B expression (compared to normal adrenal cortex). Pde8b is detectable in the adrenal gland of newborn mice and is widely expressed in other mouse tissues. We conclude that PDE8B is another PDE gene linked to iMAD; it is a candidate causative gene for other adrenocortical lesions linked to the cAMP signaling pathway and possibly for tumors in other tissues.",M2
18401830,"Protein kinase A subunit expression is altered in Bloom syndrome fibroblasts and the BLM protein is increased in adrenocortical hyperplasias: inverse findings for BLM and PRKAR1A.Bloom syndrome is a genetic disorder associated with chromosomal instability and a predisposition to tumors that is caused by germline mutations of the BLM gene, a RecQ helicase. Benign adrenocortical tumors display a degree of chromosomal instability that is more significant than benign tumors of other tissues. Cortisol-producing hyperplasias, such as primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), which has been associated with protein kinase A (PKA) abnormalities and/or PRKAR1A mutations, also show genomic instability. Another RecQ helicase, WRN, directly interacts with the PRKAR1B subunit of PKA. In this study, we have investigated the PRKAR1A expression in primary human Bloom syndrome cell lines with known BLM mutations and examined the BLM gene expression in PPNAD and other adrenal tumor tissues. PRKAR1A and other protein kinase A (PKA) subunits were expressed in Bloom syndrome cells and their level of expression differed by subunit and cell type. Overall, fibroblasts exhibited a significant decrease in protein expression of all PKA subunits except for PRKAR1A, a pattern that has been associated with neoplastic transformation in several cell types. The BLM protein was upregulated in PPNAD and other hyperplasias, compared to samples from normal adrenals and normal <e>cortex</e>, as well as samples from cortisol- and aldosterone-producing adenomas (in which BLM was largely absent). These data reveal an inverse relationship between BLM and PRKAR1A: BLM deficiency is associated with a relative excess of PRKAR1A in fibroblasts compared to other PKA subunits; and PRKAR1A deficiency is associated with increased BLM protein in adrenal hyperplasias.",M2

17955016,"Genetics of adrenal tumors associated with Cushing's syndrome: a new classification for bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasias.Adrenocortical causes of Cushing's syndrome include the following: common cortisol-producing adenomas, which are usually isolated (without associated tumors) and sporadic (without a family history); rare, but often clinically devastating, adrenocortical carcinomas; and a spectrum of adrenocorticotropin-independent, and almost always bilateral, hyperplasias, which are not rare, and are the most recently recognized cause. The majority of benign lesions of the adrenal <e>cortex</e> seem to be linked to abnormalities of the cyclic AMP signaling pathway, whereas cancer is linked to aberrant expression of insulin-like growth factor II, tumor protein p53 and related molecules. In this article, we propose a new clinical classification and nomenclature for the various forms of adrenocorticotropin-independent adrenocortical hyperplasias that is based on their histologic and genetic features. We also review the molecular genetics of adrenocortical tumors, including recent discoveries relating to the role of phosphodiesterase 11A.

The first was a thirteen and a half year old male who presented with Cushing syndrome for three years and severe osteoporosis. He had hypercortisolemia, a non-suppressible dexamethasone suppression test, and low serum ACTH. A CT scan showed slight enlargement of both adrenal glands. A bilateral adrenalectomy was performed. The second case was a thirteen-year old female who presented with mild Cushing syndrome for one year with paradoxical response to high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. An MRI revealed suspected microadenoma of the left adrenal gland. Blood sampling showed a higher cortisol level from the left adrenal vein than from the right. A left adrenalectomy was performed, followed by a right adrenalectomy four months later. The pathologies were compatible with PPNAD. Immunostaining for synaptophysin was done in both patients.

17381495,"Endogenous corticosteroid biosynthesis in subjects after bilateral adrenalectomy.OBJECtive: Corticosteroids can be synthesized in extra-adrenal tissues but the contribution of this to circulating levels in humans is not known. Previous in vitro studies suggest that the 'hybrid' corticosteroid 18-oxocortisol (18-oxoF) is produced from cortisol by aldosterone synthase. We looked for evidence of extra-adrenal production of this and other corticosteroids in 10 subjects stable on long-term glucocorticoid replacement following bilateral adrenalectomy. METHODS: In phase 1, patients were maintained on cortisol alone (30 mg/day), in phase 2 dexamethasone (2 mg/day), and in phase 3, both cortisol and dexamethasone. Each phase lasted 3 days. MEASUREMENTS: On the last day of each phase, 24-h urine collection was performed for analysis of steroid metabolite excretion [using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS)] and plasma aldosterone and renin were measured (by radioimmunoassay). RESULTS: Cortisol metabolite excretion rate [tetrahydrocortisone (THE) + tetrahydrocortisol (THF) + allotetrahydrocortisol (aTHF)] fell from 9169 nmol/24 h in phase 1 to 22 nmol/24 h in phase 2, rising to 6843 nmol/24 h in phase 3. Tetrahydroaldosterone (THAldo) excretion was readily detectable and did not alter significantly between phases (26.5, 23.5 and 28.5 nmol/24 h, respectively; P = 0.474). 18-Hydroxycortisol (18-OHF) excretion was easily detectable in phases 1 and 3 (252.5 and 212 nmol/24 h), falling in phase 2 (12 nmol/24 h). 18-oxoF excretion rates were lower but followed a similar pattern (1.62, 0.085 and 1.785 nmol/24 h in phases 1, 2 and 3, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Significant levels of adrenal steroids are found in adrenalectomized subjects. We speculate that this occurs at extra-adrenal sites or in residual adrenal <e>cortex</e> tissue in an ACTH-independent manner. Our data suggest that aldosterone synthase, acting on cortisol, is the source of 18-oxoF and 18-OHF in these subjects. Further studies of corticosteroid production within adrenalectomized subjects, looking for evidence of adrenal regrowth or residual adrenal tissue, are justified.",M2
17036196,"PRKAR1A mutations in primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease.Primary Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease (PPNAD) is a rare primary bilateral adrenal defect causing corticotropin-independent Cushing's syndrome. It occurs mainly in children and young adults. Macroscopic appearance of the adrenals is characteristic with small pigmented micronodules observed in the <e>cortex</e>. PPNAD is most often diagnosed in patients with Carney complex (CNC), but it can also be observed in patients without other manifestations or familial history (isolated PPNAD). The CNC is an autosomal dominant multiple neoplasia syndrome characterized by the association of myxoma, spotty skin pigmentation and endocrine overactivity. One of the putative CNC genes has been identified as the gene of the regulatory R1A subunit of protein kinase A (PRKAR1A), located at 17q22-24. Germline heterozygous inactivating mutations of PRKAR1A have been reported in about 45% of patients with CNC, and up to 80% of CNC patients with Cushing's syndrome due to PPNAD. Interestingly, such inactivating germline PRKAR1A mutations have also been found in patients with isolated PPNAD. The hot spot PRKAR1A mutation termed c.709[-7-2]del6 predisposes mostly to isolated PPNAD, and is the first clear genotype/phenotype correlation described for this gene. Somatic inactivating mutations of PRKAR1A have been observed in macronodules of PPNAD and in sporadic cortisol secreting adrenal adenomas. Isolated PPNAD is a genetic heterogenous disease, and recently inactivating mutations of the gene of the phosphodiesterase 11A4 (PDE11A4) located at 2q31-2q35 have been identified in patients without PRKAR1A mutations. Interestingly, both PRKAR1A and PDE11A gene products control the cAMP signaling pathway, which can be altered at various levels in endocrine tumors.",M2

Supplementary therapy in the perioperative phase]Since the publication of two case reports that are considered to represent the first clinical demonstration of iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency, it has been the generally accepted practice to cover steroid-treated patients undergoing surgery with glucocorticoids in the perioperative period. Both the inclusion criteria for the patients and the extent of the substitution pattern have been selected on an empirical rather than on a rational basis. Scientific advances over the past 50 years in the knowledge of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system's physiology and the molecular mechanism of action of its biologically active components are, for the most part, not reflected in current clinical practice and instead seem to be ignored. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests, however, that even glucocorticoid-treated patients undergoing surgery do not require maximum stress doses of hydrocortisone, which should be reserved for the treatment of sepsis. With regard to the broad spectrum of efficacy of glucocorticoids and their side effects, revision and modification of the historical regimen appear prudent.",M2

12803235,"Cushing's syndrome due to bilateral adrenocortical adenomas with unique histological features.Cushing's syndrome due to bilateral cortisol-secreting adenomas rarely occurs. We present a case of Cushing's syndrome due to bilateral adenomas. Both adenomas had distinct cell compositions, and were compared with emphasis on immunohistochemical and enzyme histochemical analysis for cytochrome P450(11beta) and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3betaHSD). A 37 year-old female was diagnosed with ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome based on physical findings and hormonal evaluation. High-resolution CT scan showed bilateral adrenocortical adenomas and atrophied glands. 131I-methylnorcholesterol incorporation into both glands suggested both adenomas were functional. Clinical diagnosis prior to surgery was ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome due to functioning bilateral adenomas. The left adrenal gland was totally resected, while the right one was partially resected by laparoscopic approach. Both adenomas were black on cut sections, and were comparatively evaluated by immunohistochemical and enzyme histochemical analysis for P450(11beta) and 3betaSD. The left adenoma was 1.6 cm in diameter and had a complex cellular composition and enzyme expression similar to that of primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), while the right adenoma was 1.8 cm in diameter with compact cells typical of a solitary cortisol-producing adenoma. Adjacent bilateral adrenal <e>cortex</e> showed marked atrophy, but contained several micronodules. Serum cortisol levels, both at basal and after a low dodexamethasone, normalized thirteen months after surgery. In conclusion, the present case of Cushing's syndrome with bilateral adrenal adenomas demonstrated for the first time the simultaneous occurrence of two distinct adenomas, an ordinary cortisol-producing adenoma and a PPNAD-like adenoma. Further case reports of multiple adrenal adenomas should be well-analyzed to clarify whether the results from this case represent a new subgroup of ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome.",M2
12692076,"Molecular cloning, chromosomal localization of human peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and PKA regulatory subunit type 1A (PRKAR1A)-associated protein PAP7, and studies in PRKAR1A mutant cells and tissues.A mouse protein that interacts with the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit RIalpha (PRKAR1A), named PBR and PKA-associated protein 7 (PAP7), was identified and shown to be involved in hormone-induced steroid biosynthesis. We report the identification of the human PAP7 gene, its expression pattern, genomic structure, and chromosomal mapping to 1q32-1q41. Human PAP7 is a 60-kDa protein highly homologous to the rodent protein. PAP7 is widely present in human tissues and highly expressed in seminal vesicles, pituitary, thyroid, pancreas, renal <e>cortex</e>, enteric epithelium, muscles, myocardium and in steroidogenic tissues, including the gonads and adrenal cortex. These tissues are also targets of Carney complex (CNC), a multiple neoplasia syndrome caused by germline inactivating PRKAR1A mutations (PRKAR1A-mut) and associated with primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) and increased steroid synthesis. PAP7 and PRKAR1A expression were studied in PPNAD and in lymphoblasts from patients bearing PRKAR1A-mut. Like PRKAR1A, PAP7 was decreased in CNC lymphocytes and PPNAD nodules, but not in the surrounding cortex. These studies showed that, like in the mouse, human PAP7 is highly expressed in steroidogenic tissues, where it follows the pattern of PRKAR1A expression, suggesting that it participates in PRKAR1A-mediated tumorigenesis and hypercortisolism.",M2
12530669,"SF-1, DAX-1, and acd: molecular determinants of adrenocortical growth and steroidogenesis.The formation of the adrenal <e>cortex</e> in humans is notable for the presence of two discrete zones, the fetal zone (FZ) which regresses soon after birth and the definitive zone (DZ) which gives rise to the classic steroidogenic zones of the adult cortex. Mice possess an analogous structure to the FZ referred to as the X-zone (XZ) which regresses at puberty in the male and during the first pregnancy in the female. Similar to the human FZ in X-linked Congenital Adrenal Hypoplasia caused by loss of function mutations in DAX-1 (Dosage-sensitive sex reversal-Adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome), the mouse XZ does not regress when DAX-1 is mutated. Only in humans with DAX-1 mutations, however, is the DZ small and hypofunctional. Patients and mice with SF-1 mutations have complete adrenal aplasia with absence of both the DZ and FZ/XZ. Lastly, the phenotype of the Autosomal Recessive Adrenocortical Dysplasia (acd) mouse is strikingly similar to human Miniature Adult Congenital Adrenal Hypoplasia, lacking an XZ/FZ and possessing a dysfunctional DZ. Current work has addressed the regulation of SF-1 and DAX-1 dependent adrenocortical growth and steroidogenesis in vivo utilizing mouse models of simple and combined SF-1 and DAX-1 deficiency. In addition, the model of compensatory adrenal growth in SF-1 haplo-insufficient mice has been applied to evaluate the potential role of SF-1 in adrenocortical proliferation.

Despite extensive investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in adrenal carcinogenesis and significant improvements in diagnostic imaging, efforts to cure advanced adrenal cancer remain largely unsuccessful. Thus, the investigation of the genetics of adrenocortical cancer by the candidate or positional cloning gene approach is essential in the development of new therapies for this disease. We propose that adrenocortical tumorigenesis follows a pattern similar to that in other organs: As the pathology of the adrenocortical tumor increases towards malignancy, the genetic changes that are observed also increase. Known genetic associations, like TP53 gene changes, occur during the latest stages of adrenocortical tumorigenesis. Thus, it is essential to study the relatively few genes that are affected at the beginning of this process, at the stages of benign tumorigenesis in the <e>cortex</e>. We have studied primary pigmented adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), a benign, bilateral, adrenocortical hyperplasia, which either in its isolated form or as part of Carney complex (CNC), is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and, therefore, the gene(s) responsible for this disorder could be identified by positional cloning approaches. Indeed, we have identified two genetic loci harboring genes for PPNAD and/or CNC on chromosomal loci 2p16 and 17q22-24. The chromosome 17 gene, PRKAR1A, was recently cloned and the identification of other responsible genes is currently under way in our, and collaborating laboratories.

11293004,"The role of the adrenal <e>cortex</e> in polycystic ovary syndrome.Adrenal androgen excess affects approximately 25% of PCOS patients. The exact etiology of this excess in PCOS patients is unclear. Some evidence that adrenal androgen excess may be a genetic trait. The adrenal androgen response to ACTH is highly individualized, and the relative response seems to be constant over time. In addition, there is a strong familial component to adrenal androgen levels in normal individuals and PCOS patients. It is possible that the tendency to overproduce adrenal androgens is an inherited risk factor for the development of PCOS. Overall, few hyperandrogenic patients actually have isolated deficiencies of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 21-hydroxylase, and 11-hydroxylase. The ovarian hormonal secretion in PCOS can affect adrenal androgen secretion and metabolism, although this factor accounts for only part of this abnormality. More likely, the adrenal androgen excess results from a generalized hyperresponsiveness of the adrenal cortex to ACTH, but without an increase in CRH or ACTH sensitivity. Although glucocorticoid administration may improve the ovulatory function of these patients, the results are modest and cannot be predicted by the circulating androgen levels.",M2

A total of 140 6-week-old rats were divided into 4 equal groups, given a single s.c. injection of 7 mg/kg 4HAQO or vehicle, followed by repeated sc administration of the synthetic ACTH or no further treatment. Subgroups of 10 rats in each group were sequentially sacrificed at weeks 20, 30, and 40. Adenomas and adenomatous nodules developed in the adrenal <e>cortex</e> of animals receiving 4HAQO and the chronic ACTH stimulation. Both lesions were located in the deeper zones of the adrenal cortex adjacent to the medulla and were composed of large-sized, clear-type cells. From week 20, middle zone, cortical cystic degeneration, which mimics the age-associated degenerative change named adrenal peliosis, was frequently observed in the adrenal glands of animals treated with 4HAQO alone. Its development was inhibited by ACTH. In the control animals, peliotic changes occurred at low incidence and only at the termination of experiment. These results indicate that long-term stimulation of ACTH promotes the development of adrenocortical tumors but suppresses the occurrence of adrenal peliosis in rats treated with 4HAQO.",M2

10084605,"Synaptophysin immunoreactivity in primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease: neuroendocrine properties of tumors associated with Carney complex.Carney complex (CNC) is characterized by lentiginosis and myxomatosis together with a variety of endocrine, neural crest-derived, and other tumors, including primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD). PPNAD is characterized by lipofuscin-containing, autonomously functioning, cortisol-producing nodules surrounded by mostly atrophic adrenocortical and normal adrenomedullary tissue. The nature and origin of the tumors, including the myxomas and PPNAD, are unclear. In this study, seven paraffin-embedded PPNAD tumors, one skin myxoma, and two cell lines (one myxoma and one PPNAD) established from patients with CNC were stained with antisera for synaptophysin (SYN), neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin A, tyrosine hydroxylase, and the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). In addition, one PPNAD specimen and one myxoma were analyzed by electron microscopy. The results showed that chromogranin A and tyrosine hydroxylase stained adrenomedullary tissue, but not the PPNAD nodules or the extranodular adrenal <e>cortex</e>. SYN, neuron-specific enolase, and NCAM also stained the medulla. PPNAD nodules and the PPNAD cell line, but not the extranodular adrenal cortex, stained intensely for SYN. The myxoma cell line, but not normal fibroblasts, stained for SYN and NCAM. Ultrastructural analysis of a PPNAD tumor and a skin myxoma revealed a well developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, prominent mitochondria, and vesicle-like structures dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. We conclude that immunostaining for SYN, a marker protein for neuroendocrine cells, clearly distinguishes PPNAD nodules from surrounding adrenocortical tissue and can be helpful in the detection of small nodules in apparently unaffected cortex. The cells of a cutaneous myxoma were also stained positive by two of the three neuroendocrine markers. Finally, both PPNAD and myxoma cells demonstrated ultrastructural features suggestive of neuroendocrine properties.

9694579,"Clinical and genetic analysis of primary bilateral adrenal diseases (micro- and macronodular disease) leading to Cushing syndrome.Primary bilateral adrenocortical diseases are rare entities that have recently been appreciated as potential causes of Cushing syndrome. They include (i) primary pigmented adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), also known as  micronodular adrenal disease , which is a genetic disorder that is often associated with Carney complex, and (ii) massive macronodular adrenocortical disease (MMAD), a rare disorder of unknown etiology that affects older adults. Carney complex is a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome that affects not only the adrenal <e>cortex</e>, but also the pituitary, thyroid, and gonads. It is associated with pigmentation abnormalities as well as myxomas and other mesenchymal and neural crest neoplasms. The inheritance of the complex is autosomal dominant, and genetic mapping has shown that at least two loci are involved in its pathogenesis. MMAD appears to be an isolated finding in most cases, and a genetic defect has not yet been defined. Ectopic expression of hormone receptors has been implicated in several cases of MMAD, but an underlying deficit has not been detected. Bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia has also been described in McCune-Albright syndrome and MEN type-1, but this finding is not always associated with hypercortisolism. The genetic defects for these diseases are known, but their role in adrenal cortex pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated.

9536213,"Current concepts of polycystic ovary syndrome.Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may be loosely defined as unexplained hyperandrogenism, with variable degrees of cutaneous symptoms, anovulatory symptoms, and obesity. The vast majority of patients with the full-blown Stein-Leventhal syndrome have functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (FOH). However, FOH often occurs without the LH excess or polycystic ovaries of classic PCOS. Functional adrenal hyperandrogenism (FAH) is often found in the syndrome, but it is less closely associated with anovulatory symptoms than is FOH. The vast majority of FOH seems to arise from abnormal regulation (dysregulation) of ovarian androgen secretion. This typically is due to escape from desensitization to luteinizing hormone (LH); this appears to occur because of a breakdown in the processes that normally coordinate ovarian androgen and oestrogen secretion so as to prevent hyperoestrogenism. Similar dysregulation of adrenal androgen secretion in response to ACTH seems to account for most FAH. Dysregulation of androgen secretion may affect the ovary alone (isolated FOH), the adrenal alone (isolated FAH), or both together. Modest insulin resistance is common in PCOS/FOH, and the resultant hyperinsulinaemia is a major candidate as the cause of the dysregulation. The hyperinsulinaemia may arise from either 'nature' (genetic defects) or 'nurture' (exogenous obesity). Although hyperinsulinaemia alone does not have an obvious effect on steroidogenesis, it may act in genetically predisposed women as a 'second hit' to unmask latent abnormalities in steroidogenesis. The ovary, the adrenal <e>cortex</e>, and several other organs paradoxically function as if responding to the hyperinsulinaemic state in spite of resistance to the effects of insulin on glucose metabolism. PCOS should be viewed as an early manifestation of a hyperinsulinaemic condition that will predispose to cardiovascular and metabolic complications later in life. A subset of PCOS patients appear to have not only insulin resistance but also beta-cell secretory dysfunction, which may indicate a relationship of the disorder to NIDDM. The fundamental genetic defects remain to be elucidated.",M2

The specific control of adrenal androgens remains unclear. While ACTH stimulates adrenal androgen secretion, the dissociation of cortisol and androgens occurring during adrenarche and under pathological conditions suggests other factors are involved. Recent studies using human adrenal cells in vitro have demonstrated that the ratio of androgen to cortisol produced is substantially independent of the age and gender of the adrenal, indicating that extra-adrenal factors are of greater importance. beta-Endorphin and joining peptide have been shown to stimulate androgen production in human adrenal cells and to influence ACTH-stimulated steroidogenesis in a manner that promotes adrenal androgen production. The activity of these pro-opiomelanocortin-derived peptides may explain the physiological and pathological dissociations of androgens and cortisol.",M2

Evidence for adrenal secretion of sulfate-conjugated cortisol, 11 beta,17 alpha-dihydroxy-4-pregnene-3,20-dione-21-yl-sulfate.A method was developed for the estimation of levels of cortisol-21-sulfate (F KS), cortisone-21-sulfate (ES), and 20(alpha + beta)-reduced cortisol-21-sulfates in blood plasma. Levels of these conjugates were determined in peripheral vein plasma of 42 normal subjects, 21 men, and 21 women (age range 20-64 years) and in adrenal vein plasma of patients with various adrenocortical disorders, six patients with primary hyperaldosteronism, five patients with Cushing's syndrome, and in two obese patients, suspected to have Cushing's syndrome, but with inconclusive laboratory findings. Adrenal vein blood was obtained by percutaneous, trans-femoral adrenal vein catheterization. Levels of non-conjugated (free) cortisol were determined in all plasma samples along with those of the sulfated steroids. F kappa S was found in all plasma samples, both in men and women. The variation in F kappa S levels paralleled that in the free cortisol levels, thus the ratio of F kappa/F kappa S was the same in the blood samples drawn at 8 AM as in those drawn at 4 PM or 5 PM (ranges: 17.5-36.3 in men, 23.6-45.8 in women). The levels of F kappa S were relatively lower in women than in men (women 610-880 ng/100 mL at AM, 300-510 ng/100 mL at PM; men: 760-1,220 ng/100 mL at AM, 380-760 ng/100 mL at PM). Plasma levels of total sulfate-conjugated delta 4-3-keto-C-21 steroids (F kappa S + E kappa S + 20(alpha+beta)-dihydrocortisol-21-sulfates) were 30-40% higher than those of the levels of cortisol-21-sulfate alone (separated by thin-layer chromatography). In the adrenal vein plasma, levels of delta 4-3-keto-C-21-steroid-21-yl sulfates were 20 to 40 times higher than levels of these steroids in the peripheral blood. The bulk of the steroid sulfate measured in the adrenal vein plasma consisted of cortisol-21-sulfate. The ratio of F kappa/F kappa S in the adrenal vein plasma was markedly smaller than in the peripheral vein plasma; it was 6.9-12.3 in males and 4.9-6.7 in females, whereas in the peripheral vein of the same subjects it was 19.2-43.7 in males and 21.4-48.3 in females. Cortisol-21-sulfate isolated from adrenal vein plasma was identified by mass spectrometry. The data presented provide evidence for the secretion of this conjugate by the adrenal <e>cortex</e>. Its secretion appears to be markedly elevated in patients with Cushing's syndrome, both due to hyperplasia and due to adrenal adenoma, as compared with normal subjects and patients with primary aldosteronism, both males and females. However, the F kappa/F kappa S ratio was markedly lower in Cushing's patients due to adrenal adenoma than due to adrenal hyperplasia, this suggesting that ACTH is stimulating intra-adrenal hydrolysis of cortisol sulfate.",M2
7571281,"Polyglandular deficiency syndrome in a boxer dog: thyroid hormone and glucocorticoid deficiency.Primary hypothyroidism and partial primary adrenocortical deficiency (isolated glucocorticoid deficiency) were diagnosed in an 8-year-old spayed female boxer dog, presented because of progressive symmetrical truncal alopecia, lethargy, and intolerance to cold. The diagnosis was based upon the combination of low, non-TSH-responsive concentrations of plasma thyroxine and low urinary excretion of corticoids together with high plasma concentrations of ACTH. Normal suppressibility of ACTH concentrations by a low dose of dexamethasone indicated an intact feedback system. Plasma growth hormone levels were elevated, most probably because somatostatin release was depressed by the glucocorticoid deficiency. The dog improved during oral replacement therapy with thyroxine until death ensued after 9 months as a result of intercurrent disease. Autopsy revealed thyroid atrophy and lymphocytic adrenalitis with complete destruction of the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis of the adrenal <e>cortex</e>. The combination of primary hypothyroidism and primary adrenocortical deficiency in this dog is identical to the entity known as type II polyglandular autoimmunity or Schmidt's syndrome in humans.

All variables have been correlated with pathological diagnosis. The samples were selected from paraffin-embedded tissue, and representative lesions were Feulgen stained. Densitometric study showed aneuploid cell lines in every carcinoma, 5 of 8 adenomas, and 5 of 10 hyperplastic lesions. Both DNA nuclear content (mean ploidy of 2.11 c, 2.41 c, and 3.05 c) mean nuclear area (average of 31.26 microns 2, 35.92 microns 2, and 42.39 microns 2) showed progressive increase from hyperplasia to adenoma, and carcinoma. Mean shape factors were lowest in adenomas (1.69) and highest in carcinomas (1.82). Those karyometric variables which showed statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) among diagnostic groups were included in a stepwise three-way discriminant analysis. Only three parameters, shape factor (p = 0.0008), mean ploidy (p = 0.0012), and adrenal weight (p = 0.0055) persisted as independent predictive factors. Using the three variables selected by discriminant analysis on our cases, 100% of the adenomas were correctly classified, 83% of the carcinomas, and 80% of the hyperplasias. Tumour weight and nuclear shape factor differentiated adrenal cortex adenoma from carcinoma, while mean ploidy distinguished adrenal cortical hyperplasia from carcinoma. Nuclear pleomorphism (shape factor) and DNA-ploidy are the most important nuclear features in predicting the biological course of proliferative adrenal cortex lesions, although by themselves they are not bona-fide discriminators.",M2

We have studied eight cases of the adrenals with PPNAD by immunohistochemistry of all steroidogenic enzymes involved in cortisol biosynthesis (P-45scc, 3 beta-HSD, P-450c21, P-45017 alpha, and P-45011 beta) and also by performing in situ hybridization of P-45017 alpha in seven cases in order to localize the sites of specific steroidogenesis in this unique disorder. Immunoreactivity of all the enzymes examined was intense in almost all of the cells in adrenocortical nodules, especially the cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm in all the cases examined. The internodular <e>cortex</e>, which demonstrated atrophy in five cases, normal appearance in two cases and hyperplasia in one case, was negative for the enzymes with an exception of 3 beta-HSD. Hybridization signals of P-45017 alpha were condensed over the nodules in in situ hybridization study, suggestive of an increased production of the enzyme itself in cortical cells of the nodules. These results may be consistent with autonomous cortisol production by the nodular cells and indicate that almost all of the cells in the nodules produce cortisol, which can also explain the presence of hypercortisolism despite small sizes of adrenals in PPNAD. Immunoreactivity of steroidogenic enzymes is observed in a small cluster of cortical cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm located at the zona reticularis but not in adjacent non-nodular cortex, which may support an abnormal development of the zona reticularis as a possible pathogenesis of this disorder.",M2

Adrenal cortisol secretion was not suppressed by dexamethasone, but it was ACTH responsive. Test results for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) also were negative. Image analyses revealed a normal sella turcica and significantly enlarged adrenal glands, which showed enhanced uptake of isotope. Both adrenal glands in all cases were between 72 and 176 g in combined weight and were composed of, and distorted by, yellow nodules. Histologically, small cortical cells with or without lipid, occasional clear cells, and rare compact cells of the usual size were increased in number in the glandular cords. Enzyme histochemically, cortical cells showed weaker activity for 3 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and other enzymes than did usual cortisol-producing adenomas.

The PAMD cells showed intense activity of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta DH), succinate DH, glucose-6-phosphate DH, alkaline phosphatase (AlPase), and other DHs and lysosomal hydrolases, giving a characteristic staining pattern. The staining patterns correlated well with ultrastructural findings. The larger adrenals (no. 1: 16.6 g) were associated with larger black nodules and internodular <e>cortex</e> (INC) with fairly well-retained enzyme activities, and contained cell clusters and single cells with intense AlPase activity with the appearance of PAMD nodules in the buds.

Analysis of descriptions of INC in 25 previously reported cases revealed that the larger adrenals (more than 10 g) had less atrophic INC than the smaller ones. The characteristic enzyme pattern in PAMD cells explains the paradox that PAMD adrenals smaller than normal can cause Cushing's syndrome, and may be useful for investigating neoplastic and non-neoplastic counterparts in other adrenal lesions. The relationship between PAMD cells and INC is not simply one of autonomy versus atrophy, and both cell types may be stimulated by a certain common trophic factor.

In Itsenko-Cushing syndrome, a decrease in the blood basal level of alpha-MSH and a hormone reaction to insulin hypoglycemia was noted. In patients with the hypothalamic syndrome of the pubertal period the blood level of alpha-MSH was raised and hypophyseal reactivity to insulin hypoglycemia was changed. Correlation analysis of the levels of alpha-MSH, ACTH and cortisol showed direct noticeable close relationships between the level of alpha-MSH and ACTH concentration in healthy persons and direct high close relationships between these indices in patients with Itsenko-Cushing disease.

3320551,"Physiological and pathological effects of steroids on the function of the adrenal <e>cortex</e>.The adrenal cortex is the site of the synthesis of steroid hormones such as the glucocorticoid cortisol and the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. The pathway of biosynthesis of these steroids from cholesterol involves a sequence of transformations using cytochrome P-450 enzymes which varies within the adrenal cortex as a result of the differential localization of enzymes within the zones. The hypothesis presented here is that as a result of the arrangement of the vasculature in the adrenal gland, high concentrations of steroids may be expected to accumulate and may have autoregulating effects. These may include the following: (1) the normal morphological and functional zonation of the adrenal cortex may be regulated by gradients of steroids in the adrenal cortex; (2) destruction of cytochrome P-450 enzymes on interaction with certain steroids which act as pseudosubstrates may form part of the pathogenesis of some steroidogenic enzyme deficiencies. Under normal conditions, the individual cytochrome P-450s are not rate-limiting for steroidogenesis.

6091953,"Disorders of the adrenal <e>cortex</e>: their effects on electrolyte metabolism.The adrenal cortex is an important factor in the control of electrolyte and water balance and in blood pressure homeostasis. Not surprisingly, therefore, hyper- and hyposecretion of one or more of its products has extensive repercussions. Hypersecretion of aldosterone, as seen in primary hyperaldosteronism and related diseases, and of other mineralocorticoids such as corticosterone and/or 11-deoxycorticosterone, as seen in 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency or 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency syndromes, respectively, are associated with hypertension, sodium retention, potassium wastage and a metabolic alkalosis. On the other hand, impaired secretion, as in Addison's disease or in congenital deficiencies of other steroid-synthesizing enzymes, leads to hypotension, sodium loss with hypovolaemia, and hyperkalaemia. In each case, these disturbances of electrolyte metabolism may cause neurological and muscle dysfunction. The relationship between glucocorticoid hypertension and electrolyte metabolism is less clear and the importance of the adrenal cortex in the aetiology of essential hypertension is still being assessed.",M2

Measurements of adrenal size were also made in 100 adults with no known adrenal pathology. CT proved to be a sensitive diagnostic tool in combination with clinical studies. When blood hormone levels are increased, CT can differentiate among homogeneous organic hyperplasia, nodular hyperplasia, benign adenoma, and malignant cortical adenoma. When blood hormone levels are decreased, CT can demonstrate hypoplasia or metastatic tumorous destruction. Calcifications or caseations can be demonstrated earlier than on plain radiographs. When hormone elimination is increased, the morphologic substrate can be identified; tumorous changes can be localized and infiltration of surrounding organs recognized.",M2

A portion of the left adrenal <e>cortex</e> was left in the adrenal bed, although the arterial and venous blood supply had been ligated. A successful autograft was documented 15 years postoperatively. A review of the literature failed to reveal any such successful attempt in the management of bilateral pheochromocytoma.

7054621,"Primary adrenocortical nodular dysplasia as a cause of Cushing's syndrome in infants and children.Two patients with Cushing's syndrome due to primary adrenocortical nodular dysplasia (PAND) are described. Both patients, an infant and a 14-year-old boy at the time of diagnosis, were treated by total bilateral adrenalectomy. On gross inspection, the adrenal glands of the infant did not appear to be abnormal but those of the older patient showed numerous dark nodules. Microscopically, the adrenal glands of each patient manifested multiple micronodules with internodular atrophy. The extreme internodular atrophy suggest that primary adrenocortical nodular dysplasia is a non-ACTH-dependent condition. Since the disorder appears to involve primarily the <e>cortex</e> of both adrenals, adrenalectomy followed by steroid replacement is the recommended treatment.",M2
6291814,"Regulation of the mineralocorticoid hormones in adrenocortical disorders with adrenocorticotropin excess.Chronic stimulation by adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) of the adrenal <e>cortex</e> produces different plasma mineralocorticoid hormone (MCH) patterns, depending on the amount of glucocorticoid hormones (cortisol) concurrently generated and the degree of activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Patients with Cushing's disease or the ectopic ACTH-excess syndrome have normal or low production of the MCHs, aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OHB), by the zona glomerulosa (ZG), elevated cortisol and deoxycorticosterone (DOC) levels, and high-normal to elevated production of the MCHs corticosterone (B) and 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone (18-OHDOC) by the zona fasciculata (ZF). Prolonged administration of superphysiologic doses of ACTH to normal subjects yields similar patterns. Patients with simple virilizing 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) have impaired ZF production of B and 18-OHDOC and elevated DOC, 18-OHB, and aldosterone secretion secondary to the superimposed RAS stimulation of the ZG. Patients with 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (17 alpha-OHD) have elevated levels of the ZF MCHs DOC, B, 18-OHDOC, and 18-OHB and a functionally suppressed ZG. Patients with 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency (11 beta-OHD) have only elevated production of DOC by the ZF and suppressed RAS and aldosterone. A significant negative correlation between cortisol and aldosterone concentrations suggests that cortisol is involved in the ACTH-mediated inhibition of aldosterone formation.",M2

Results of electron-microscopic and histochemical time-response studies with rat models revealed an early, retrograde embolization of medullary cells and cell fragments in the cortical capillaries that showed prominent endothelial injury. The experimental adrenal lesions were prevented by surgical removal of the medulla one month before administration of adrenocorticolytic chemicals, or by the administration of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride. Histochemical staining for medullary (argyrophil) granules in human cases of adrenal necrosis demonstrated tissue fragments that stained positively for silver in vascular cortical spaces in nine of ten autopsy specimens and in all four surgical cases we reviewed. Thus, catecholamines released from the adrenal medulla and from the retrograde medullary emboli in the <e>cortex</e> may have a role in the pathogenesis of adrenocortical necrosis.",M2

The uptake of iodocholesterol, in addition to localizing adrenal cortical abnormalities, can be manipulate to focus on adrenal cortical dysfunction in either the aldosterone, cortisol, or androgenproducing portions of the adrenal cortex. The uptake of iodocholesterol correlates significantly with the abnormal secretion of cortisol in Cushing's syndrome, aldosterone in the model of adrenal zona glomerulosa function, and adrenal androgen secretion in hyperandorgenism. For these reasons, adrenal scintigraphy is an important diagnostic modality in the evaluation of adrenal cortical function.",M2

This lesion occurs almost exclusively in female animals and was seen in only one of 50 male animals older than 600 days examined. Experimental stimulation or inhibition did not influence adrenal peliosis. Electron microscopically, there was marked pericapillary edema with collapse of the capillaries, and erythrocytes and thrombocytes were seen infiltrating the edema. Fibrin accumulated in the larger foci. Degenerative alterations were not observed either in the epithelial cells of the cortex or in mesenchymal cells. The pathogenesis is unknown, but the possible role of constant estrus in aging female rats will be discussed.",M2
7444415,"[Morphology of the adrenal <e>cortex</e> in Cushing's syndrome]Histological slides of the adrenals of 54 patients who underwent uni- or bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome at the Zürich University Hospital Department of urology between 1960 and 1977 were reexamined. In 29 patients (53.7%) Cushing's disease was due to diffuse bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia, in 4 (7.4%) to micronodular cortical hyperplasia and in 3 (5.6%) to macronodular cortical hyperplasia and in 3 (5.6%) to macronodular hyperplasia. Two patients (3.7%) presented with primary bilateral nodular cortical dysplasia (so-called microadenomatosis). In 12 cases of Cushing's syndrome (22.2%) the basic lesion was a cortical adenoma and in 4 cases (7.4%) a cortical carcinoma. The histologic diagnoses corresponded well with biochemical findings, clinical diagnoses and further development of the disease. Histopathologic diagnosis of diffuse and micronodular hyperplasia presents no difficulties. Differential diagnosis of macronodular hyperplasia, cortical dysplasia, adenoma, and carcinoma may, however, be somewhat more problematic.",M2
6103978,"Pathogenesis of experimental adrenal hemorrhagic necrosis ( apoplexy ): ultrastructural, biochemical, neuropharmacologic, and blood coagulation studies with acrylonitrile in the rat.The pathogenesis of experimental adrenal hemorrhagic necrosis produced by acrylonitrile in the rat was investigated by various morphologic, biochemical, and pharmacologic methods. One dose of this chemical injected intravenously caused 100 per cent incidence of adrenal hemorrhage and necrosis in 90 to 120 minutes. Electron microscopy, histochemistry, and light microscopy combined with colloidal carbon labeling suggested an early damage (30 minutes after administration of acrylonitrile) to the vascular endothelium in the adrenal <e>cortex</e>, prominent at 60 minutes, when lesion to the parenchymal cells was not visible. The use of extracellular diffusion tracer horseradish peroxidase further indicated that parenchymal cell injury was a late event. Damage to the vascular endothelium in the adrenal cortex was associated with retrograde embolization of medullary cells and cell fragments into the cortical capillaries. The ultrastructurally demonstrated platelet aggregation and fibrin precipitation at the sites of discontinuous vascular endothelium were accompanied by a decrease in circulating platelets and fibrinogen as well as prolongation of prothrombin, partial thromboplastin, and thrombin time. The concentration of dopamine, unlike that of noradrenaline, in the adrenals but not in the brain of rats injected with acrylonitrile showed a time-dependent elevation. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (alpha-adrenergic antagonist) or labetalol (alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker) or metyrapone (11-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor) and the depletion of catecholamines by reserpine or prior medullectomy prevented the chemically induced adrenal necrosis. These results indicate that the presence of a functional adrenal cortex is necessary for the development of cortical damage which is associated with early vascular lesion caused and/or modulated by vasoactive amines from the medulla and/or (metabolites of) acrylonitrile.",M2

The mean plasma levels of 18-OH-DOC at 0800h in normal males and in the follicular and luteal phases of normal females were 8.2 +/- 3.9 ng/100 ml (Mean +/- SD), 7.8 +/- 2.6 ng/100ml and 11.5 +/- 2.8 ng/100ml, respectively. The corresponding levels of 18-OH-B in normal males and in the follicular and luteal phases of normal females were 10.3 +/- 4.2 ng/100ml, 12.4 +/- 4.5 ng/100ml and 13.8 +/- 4.1 ng/100ml, respectively. No differences between the sexes nor the phases of the menstrual cycle were confirmed. ACTH stimulation increased plasma concentrations of 18-OH-DOC and 18-OH-B by 5.1 and 4.4 times respectively, while dexamethasone markedly decreased these 2 steroids. An upright posture increased these steroids significantly. In patients with Cushing syndrome, plasma levels of these 2 steroids were rarely high in cases with adrenocortical hyperplasia and adrenocortical carcinoma, while they were usually within the normal range in adrenocortical adenoma. These 2 steroid levels were increased in primary aldosteronism, idiopathic hyperaldosteronism and congenital 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. They were decreased in Addison's disease and the salt-loosing type of congenital 21 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. Patients with congenital 21 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (simple form) showed elevated levels of 18-OH-DOC and normal levels of 18-OH-B. In vitro production of 18-OH-DOC and 18-OH-B was studied by tissue slices of the normal adrenal <e>cortex</e>, adrenocortical carcinoma causing Cushing syndrome, aldosteronoma and nodular hyperplasia with hyperaldosteronism. In the normal adrenal cortex, the mean production rates of 18-OH-DOC and 18-OH-B were 31 and 26 ng/g tissue/hr, respectively. ACTH and angiotensin II significantly increased the production of both 18-OH-DOC and 18-OH-B. In adrenocortical carcinoma, the production of these steroids was markedly diminished and not stimulated with either ACTH or angiotensin II. Aldosteronoma tissue produced these 2 steroids 20 to 40 times that of the normal adrenal tissue and was significantly increased with the addition of ACTH and angiotensin II. Nodular hyperplasia with hyperaldosteronism produced much 18-OH-DOC and 18-OH-B, but did not respond to ACTH and angiotensin II.",M2
