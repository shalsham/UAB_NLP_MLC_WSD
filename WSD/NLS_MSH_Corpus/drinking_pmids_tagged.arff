20484944,"Feasibility and impact of placing water coolers on sales of sugar-sweetened beverages in Dutch secondary school canteens.AIMS: The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of placing water coolers on sugar-sweetened beverage sales at secondary schools (age 12-18 years) in the city of Zwolle, the Netherlands. METHODS: Six schools, hosting 5,866 pupils, were divided in three intervention and three control schools. In the intervention schools, water coolers were placed in the canteen. Hidden observations were performed in one school to study the intervention's feasibility, and school personnel was interviewed. Beverage sales were monitored before and during the intervention. After the intervention period, 366 class 1 and 2 pupils completed a questionnaire about their <e>drinking</e> habits (response rate 81%). RESULTS: Placement of water coolers appeared to be a feasible intervention at secondary schools. However, it did not affect sales of sugar-sweetened beverages at schools. Although mean intake of sugar-sweetened beverages at school was high, more than 500 ml/day for boys, and more than 250 ml/day for girls, only a minority of these quantities was purchased at school. CONCLUSION: We conclude that placing water coolers as a single-issue intervention in secondary school canteens should not be prioritized in the combat against obesity.",M1
20447094,"Understanding the mechanism of the water <e>drinking</e> test: the role of fluid challenge volume in patients with medically controlled primary open angle glaucoma.BACKGROUND: To determine whether a 500-mL fluid challenge produces a different intraocular pressure (IOP) response profile compared with a 1000-mL water drinking test (WDT). METHODS: Prospective, observer-masked, cross-over, observational study. Patients with primary open angle glaucoma were recruited from a private specialist glaucoma practice. One eye of each patient was included. Subjects were randomized to receive either a 500-mL or 1000-mL fluid challenge. Baseline IOP was recorded with a Goldmann applanation tonometer and then every 15 min for 1 h. A second WDT with the alternate volume of water was performed after a minimum washout period of 24 h. Primary statistical analysis was performed using a two-way anova repeated measures of variance with a Bonferroni post-hoc test. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included in this study. The mean patient age was 67.0 +/- 10.2 (SD) years, and 60% of patients were female. There was no statistically significant difference in baseline IOP between the 500-mL and 1000-mL WDTs (P = 0.11). Both fluid challenge volumes produced a statistically significant rise in IOP from baseline at 15, 30 and 45 min after water ingestion. However the mean maximum increase in IOP was less in the 500-mL WDT (3.3 +/- 1.8 mmHg [23.9%]) compared with the 1000-mL WDT (4.9 +/- 2.3 mmHg [32.5%]; P = 0.0095). CONCLUSION: The 500-mL WDT may provide an alternative for patients who are unable to tolerate drinking 1000 mL of water. However, because the maximum IOP obtained is less, a 500-mL WDT cannot be used to directly estimate peak diurnal pressure.",M1

20418637,"Child-education program for the reduction of health risks due to fluoride in water sources in the Chiang Mai Basin, Thailand.Groundwater is the major source of <e>drinking</e> water in Lamphun Province in the Chiang Mai Basin, Thailand. However, groundwater contains high fluoride up to 16 mg F/L, which has caused dental and skeletal fluorosis. Although Thai Government installed RO membrane plants for the removal of fluoride from groundwater; and delivers RO-filtered bottled water that contains less fluoride than the Thai Standard of 0.7 mg F/L, it was found that the urinary fluoride levels are still high among the residents. To find the major sources of fluoride intake, fluoride contents in various water sources, such as village water supply, shallow and deep groundwaters, rain water and bottled water, were measured, and the local people's behavior on water uses was recorded by interview and questionnaire study. As a result, it was found that the highest risk of fluoride ingestion comes from cooking rice with fluoride-containing water because of a lack of knowledge on fluoride sources and fluoride chemistry. To reduce the health risks arising from fluoride intake, a hands-on educational program on the sources and risks of fluoride in water was developed and implemented in the local schools. The participatory educational program promoted active involvement of schoolchildren, but it was found that the effectiveness of education varied depending on the questions we asked. Therefore, it needs to be improved by an iterative and interactive educational program. In conclusion, it was found that the benefits of providing safe drinking water using such advanced technology as RO membrane can be maximized only when it comes along with a participatory educational program on fluoride sources and health risks.",M1
20393621,"[The Bah√≠a 2008 Study: hydration barometer in the Spanish population]BACKGROUND: Vital functions require a balance between the loss and ingestion of liquids. There are no studies about hydration on Spanish population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 6,508 questionnaires were applied to a randomly selected Spanish population, together with a 24-hour recall in order to measure liquid consumption and variables related to it. RESULTS: The average consumption of liquids was 2,089.5 +/- 771.4 and 6.05 <e>drinking</e> times/day. 3,423 persons (52.6% of the studied people, CI 95% 51.3%-53.8%) were well-hydrated when considering their individual intake. The frequency and volume of drinking decreased with age. 61% (CI 95% 58.64%-64.01%) of the population older than 65 years were badly hydrated. The greatest bottled water consumption corresponded to the youngest population (18-29 years). The greater the physical activity, the greater the beverages consumption (1,987.6 +/- 705.5 ml vs 2,345.8 +/- 928.1 ml, low vs. intense physical activity, respectively). With regard to the intake frequency and volume, mineral and tap water were the most consumed. Those who drank mineral water exceeded the 2 l-recommendation in order to maintain a good hydration status. 59.8% (CI 95% 57.83%-61.76%) of those who preferred mineral water drank more than 2 l/day and drank more times/day and in greater amounts. There was a greater frequency and amount of beverage consumption when people lived in the same house, and particularly more in houses where children were living (2,197.4 +/- 767.8 ml vs 2,055.7 +/- 769.86 ml and 6.4 +/- 2.2 times vs 5.9 +/- 1,9 times, in homes with or without children, respectively). Bottled water was preferred at home (79.07%) and at work (15.61%). CONCLUSIONS: Only half of the Spanish population is well hydrated. Sixty-one percent of people over the age of 65 years were poorly hydrated, consequence it is imperative to promote its consumption.",M1
20391122,"Trihalomethanes in <e>drinking</e> water and the risk of death from rectal cancer: does hardness in drinking water matter?The objectives of this study were (1) to examine the relationship between total trihalomethanes (TTHM) levels in public water supplies and risk of rectal cancer development and (2) to determine whether calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) levels in drinking water might modify the effects of TTHM on risk of developing rectal cancer. A matched cancer case-control study was used to investigate the relationship between the risk of death attributed to rectal cancer and exposure to TTHM in drinking water in 53 municipalities in Taiwan. All rectal cancer deaths in the 53 municipalities from 1998 through 2007 were obtained from the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Health. Controls were deaths from other causes and were pair-matched to cancer cases by gender, year of birth, and year of death. Each matched control was selected randomly from the set of possible controls for each cancer case. Data on TTHM levels in drinking water were collected from the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration. Information on the levels of Ca and Mg in drinking water was obtained from the Taiwan Water Supply Corporation. The municipality of residence for cancer cases and controls was presumed to be the source of the subject's TTHM, Ca, and Mg exposure via drinking water. Relative to individuals whose TTHM exposure level was &lt;4.9 ppb, the adjusted OR (95% CI) for rectal cancer occurrence was 1.04 (0.88-1.22) for individuals who resided in municipalities served by drinking water with a TTHM exposure &gt;or=4.9 ppb. There was no evidence of an interaction of drinking-water TTHM levels with low Ca intake via drinking water. However, evidence of an interaction was noted between drinking-water TTHM concentrations and Mg intake via drinking water. Our findings showed that the correlation between TTHM exposure and risk of rectal cancer is influenced by Mg in drinking water. Increased knowledge of the interaction between Mg and TTHM in reducing rectal cancer risk will aid in public policymaking and standard setting.",M1
20382380,"Sub-chronic effects of nitrate in <e>drinking</e> water on red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa): oxidative stress and T-cell mediated immune function.In order to evaluate the effects of nitrates on birds, we have exposed captive red-legged partridges to nitrates concentrations of 0 (control), 100 (dwell water in farming areas) or 500 mg/l (fertirrigation level). The cellular immune response, plasma biochemistry, methemoglobin concentration (metHb), and oxidative stress biomarkers in blood and tissues were studied after two weeks of exposure. Several blood parameters such as aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities and magnesium level decreased with nitrate exposure, whereas alkaline phosphatase activity and creatinine level increased. The oxidant effect of nitrates was evidenced by the increase in blood metHb, accompanied by the lipid peroxidation of red blood cells, the increased levels of oxidized glutathione (GSH) in liver, and the generation of oxidative DNA damage in plasma lymphocytes. GSH in erythrocytes was negatively correlated with blood metHb. The cellular immune function was slightly lower at partridges exposed to nitrates. These results suggest that adverse effects of nitrates on birds occur at concentrations potentially present in the field.",M1

20364123,"The molecular basis for water taste in Drosophila.The detection of water and the regulation of water intake are essential for animals to maintain proper osmotic homeostasis. Drosophila and other insects have gustatory sensory neurons that mediate the recognition of external water sources, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism for water taste detection. Here we identify a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel family, PPK28, as an osmosensitive ion channel that mediates the cellular and behavioural response to water. We use molecular, cellular, calcium imaging and electrophysiological approaches to show that ppk28 is expressed in water-sensing neurons, and that loss of ppk28 abolishes water sensitivity. Moreover, ectopic expression of ppk28 confers water sensitivity to bitter-sensing gustatory neurons in the fly and sensitivity to hypo-osmotic solutions when expressed in heterologous cells. These studies link an osmosensitive ion channel to water taste detection and <e>drinking</e> behaviour, providing the framework for examining the molecular basis for water detection in other animals.",M1
20354657,"Mice <e>drinking</e> goji berry juice (Lycium barbarum) are protected from UV radiation-induced skin damage via antioxidant pathways.The goji berry, Lycium barbarum, has long been recognised in traditional Chinese medicine for various therapeutic properties based on its antioxidant and immune-modulating effects. This study describes the potential for orally consumed goji berry juice to alter the photodamage induced in the skin of mice by acute solar simulated UV (SSUV) irradiation. In Skh:hr-1 hairless mice, 5% goji berry juice significantly reduced the inflammatory oedema of the sunburn reaction. Dilutions of goji berry juice between 1% and 10% dose-dependently protected against SSUV-induced immunosuppression, and against suppression induced by the mediator, cis-urocanic acid, measured by the contact hypersensitivity reaction. The immune protection could not be ascribed to either the minor excipients in the goji juice, pear and apple juice, nor the vitamin C content, nor the preservative, and appeared to be a property of the goji berry itself. Antioxidant activity in the skin was demonstrated by the significant protection by 5% goji juice against lipid peroxidation induced by UVA radiation. Furthermore, two known inducible endogenous skin antioxidants, haem oxygenase-1 and metallothionein, were found to be involved in the photoimmune protection. The results suggest that consumption of this juice could provide additional photoprotection for susceptible humans.",M1
20219664,"Ameliorative effect of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. leaves extract (ELE) on insulin resistance and abnormal perivascular innervation in fructose-<e>drinking</e> rats.AIM OF THE STUDY: Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. leaf is a traditional Chinese medicine that exhibits an anti-diabetic action. This study was designed to investigate whether long-term administration of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. leaves extract (ELE) ameliorates pre-diabetic state of insulin resistance and abnormal perivascular innervation in the hyperinsulinemic state. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELE at doses of 500 and 1000mg/kg was administered orally once daily for 4 weeks in fructose-drinking rats (FDRs). Plasma levels of insulin, blood glucose levels, and perivascular innervation were assessed using biochemical and immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: FDR showed significant increase in plasma levels of insulin, an index for insulin resistance (Homeostasis Model Assessment ratio-HOMA-IR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP), but not blood glucose levels, as compared with control rats. Immunohistochemical study showed significantly greater density of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-like immunoreactivity (LI)-containing nerves and significantly lower density of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-LI-containing nerves in mesenteric arteries of FDR than those in control. A 4-week treatment with ELE (500 and 1000mg/kg, p.o.) significantly decreased plasma levels of insulin and HOMA-IR without affecting blood glucose levels and significantly lowered SBP in FDR. ELE treatment in FDR resulted in significant increase in CGRP-LI never fiber density and significant decrease in TH-LI never fiber density in mesenteric arteries of FDR. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that long-term ELE treatment effectively prevents insulin resistance development and ameliorates abnormal perivascular innervation in FDR.",M1
20210616,"Fluid consumption and sweating in National Football League and collegiate football players with different access to fluids during practice.CONTEXT: Considerable controversy regarding fluid replacement during exercise currently exists. OBJECTIVE: To compare fluid turnover between National Football League (NFL) players who have constant fluid access and collegiate football players who replace fluids during water breaks in practices. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Respective preseason training camps of 1 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II (DII) football team and 1 NFL football team. Both morning and afternoon practices for DII players were 2.25 hours in length, and NFL players practiced for 2.25 hours in the morning and 1 hour in the afternoon. Environmental conditions did not differ. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Eight NFL players (4 linemen, 4 backs) and 8 physically matched DII players (4 linemen, 4 backs) participated. Intervention(s): All players drank fluids only from their predetermined individual containers. The NFL players could consume both water and sports drinks, and the DII players could only consume water. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We measured fluid consumption, sweat rate, total sweat loss, and percentage of sweat loss replaced. Sweat rate was calculated as change in mass adjusted for fluids consumed and urine produced. RESULTS: Mean sweat rate was not different between NFL (2.1 +/- 0.25 L/h) and DII (1.8 +/- 0.15 L/h) players (F(1,12) = 2, P = .18) but was different between linemen (2.3 +/- 0.2 L/h) and backs (1.6 +/- 0.2 L/h) (t(14) = 3.14, P = .007). We found no differences between NFL and DII players in terms of percentage of weight loss (t(7) = -0.03, P = .98) or rate of fluid consumption (t(7) = -0.76, P = .47). Daily sweat loss was greater in DII (8.0 +/- 2.0 L) than in NFL (6.4 +/- 2.1 L) players (t(7) = -3, P = .02), and fluid consumed was also greater in DII (5.0 +/- 1.5 L) than in NFL (4.0 +/- 1.1 L) players (t(7) = -2.8, P = .026). We found a correlation between sweat loss and fluids consumed (r = 0.79, P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: During preseason practices, the DII players <e>drinking</e> water at water breaks replaced the same volume of fluid (66% of weight lost) as NFL players with constant access to both water and sports drinks.",M1
20199991,"Maintained total body water content and serum sodium concentrations despite body mass loss in female ultra-runners <e>drinking</e> ad libitum during a 100 km race.We investigated in 11 female ultra-runners during a 100 km ultra-run, the association between fluid intake and prevalence of exercise-associated hyponatremia in a cross-sectional study. Athletes drank ad libitum and recorded their fluid intake. They competed at 8.0 (1.0) km/h and finished within 762 (91) min. Fluid intake was 4.1 (1.3) L during the race, equal to 0.3 (0.1) L/h. Body mass decreased by 1.5 kg (p&lt; 0.01); pre race body mass was related to speed in the race (r = -0.78, p&lt; 0.05); and change (Delta) in body mass was not associated with speed in the race. Change in body mass was positively (r = 0.70; p&lt; 0.05), and Delta urinary specific gravity negatively (r = -0.67; p&lt; 0.05), correlated to Delta percent total body water. Changes in body mass were not related to fluid intake during the race. Fluid intake was not correlated to running speed and showed no association with either Delta percent total body water nor Delta [Na] in plasma. Fluid intake showed no relationship with both Delta haematocrit and Delta plasma volume. No exercise-associated hyponatremia occurred. Female ultra- runners consuming fluids ad libitum during the race experienced no fluid overload, and ad libitum drinking protects against exercise-associated hyponatremia. The reported higher incidence of exercise-associated hyponatremia in women is not really a gender effect but due to women being more prone to overdrink.",M1
20180327,"Delayed puberty onset in rats that consumed aqueous extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa during the juvenile-pubertal period.The report that intervention during the juvenile-pubertal period in rats modifies the phenotype induced by prenatal nutrition suggests some degree of plasticity in the juvenile-pubertal period. It is not known whether consumption of aqueous extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) during the juvenile-pubertal period will affect the growth and onset of puberty in rats. The present study was therefore designed to investigate this. Weaned 21-days-old rats, whose mothers were given food and water ad libitum during pregnancy and lactation, were divided randomly into three groups of nine rats each. Control group had tap water only while the extract groups had 0.6 g extract/100 mL and 1.8 g extract/100 mL as their <e>drinking</e> solution throughout the juvenile-pubertal period [postnatal day (PND) 21-puberty onset]. From PND 30 onwards, the rats were inspected daily for vaginal opening, which was used as the index for puberty onset. Rats in the HS groups (0.6 and 1.8 g/100 mL) drank less fluid (solution of HS extract and water) and consumed less food compared with the control group at all periods of measurement. The weight of 0.6 g/100 mL was not different from the control whereas 1.8 g/100 mL was lower at PND 28, similar at PND 35 and higher at PND 42 compared with the control. Puberty onset in the HS groups was significantly delayed compared with the control. It is concluded that consumption of aqueous extract of HS during the juvenile-pubertal period decreased fluid and food consumption, increased weight gain and delayed puberty onset in rats.",M1
20176332,"Aluminum affects glial system and behavior of rats.Aluminum (Al) has been associated with neuronal dysfunction. These neuronal changes may involve glial alterations. We intend to evaluate the consequence of Al on the glial system and the behavior of rats exposed chronically to 0.3% of aluminum chloride in <e>drinking</e> water during 4 months in adulthood (A) or since intra-uterine age (IU); animals from this latter group were sacrificed at four months of age. Our data show an intense glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactivity with a high density of astrocytes in both treated groups compared with controls. However, in IU rats, astrocytes display prominent glial cell bodies and processes. A and IU rat groups perform a significantly reduced locomotor activity. However, using the dark/light box test, the IU rats prefer to spend more time in the enlightened compartment compared to other groups. Behavioral and glial changes caused by Al exposure bring support for the role of Al in brain dysfunction involving glial alterations.",M1
20162260,"Perchlorate in tap water, groundwater, surface waters, and bottled water from China and its association with other inorganic anions and with disinfection byproducts.Perchlorate is a potent thyroid hormone-disrupting compound. <e>Drinking</e> water is one of the major sources of human exposure to perchlorate. Little is known about the occurrence of perchlorate in waters from China. In this study, water samples (n = 300) collected from 15 locations in 13 provinces and municipalities were analyzed for the presence of perchlorate. In addition, other inorganic anions that commonly occur in water--iodide, bromide, and nitrate--and the disinfection byproducts, bromate, chlorate, and chlorite were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography interfaced with tandem mass spectrometry. Perchlorate was detected in 86% of the samples analyzed, at concentrations ranging from &lt;0.02 to 54.4 microg l(-1) (mean +/- SD 2.20 +/- 6.39 microg l(-1); median 0.62 microg l(-1)). Mean concentrations of perchlorate in tap water, groundwater, surface waters, and bottled water were 2.46, 3.04, 2.82, and 0.22 microg l(-1), respectively. Significant positive correlations were found between the concentrations of perchlorate and nitrate, perchlorate and chlorate, bromide and iodide, and nitrate and iodide.",M1
20158967,"Perceptions about availability and adequacy of <e>drinking</e> water in a large California school district.INTRODUCTION: Concerns about the influence of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption on obesity have led experts to recommend that water be freely available in schools. We explored perceptions about the adequacy of drinking water provision in a large California school district to develop policies and programs to encourage student water consumption. METHODS: From March to September 2007, we used semistructured interviews to ask 26 California key stakeholders - including school administrators and staff, health and nutrition agency representatives, and families - about school drinking water accessibility; attitudes about, facilitators of, and barriers to drinking water provision; and ideas for increasing water consumption. Interviews were analyzed to determine common themes. RESULTS: Although stakeholders said that water was available from school drinking fountains, they expressed concerns about the appeal, taste, appearance, and safety of fountain water and worried about the affordability and environmental effect of bottled water sold in schools. Stakeholders supported efforts to improve free drinking water availability in schools, but perceived barriers (eg, cost) and mistaken beliefs that regulations and beverage contracts prohibit serving free water may prevent schools from doing so. Some schools provide water through cold-filtered water dispensers and self-serve water coolers. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to explore stakeholder perceptions about the adequacy of drinking water in US schools. Although limited in scope, our study suggests that water available in at least some schools may be inadequate. Collaborative efforts among schools, communities, and policy makers are needed to improve school drinking water provision.",M1
20157720,"Biodistribution of (137)Cs in a mouse model of chronic contamination by ingestion and effects on the hematopoietic system.The aim of this work was to define the possible occurrence of hematological changes during the course of a chronic ingestion of (137)Cs. A mouse model was used, with ingestion through <e>drinking</e> water with a cesium concentration of 20 kBq l(-1). Ingestion started in parent animals before mating, and (137)Cs intake and its effect on the hematopoietic system was studied in offspring at various ages between birth and 20 weeks. (137)Cs content was measured in various organs, indicating that (137)Cs was distributed throughout the organism including lympho-hematopoietic organs, i.e., femurs, spleen and thymus. However, we did not observe any effect on the hematopoietic system, whatever the parameter used. In fact, blood cell counts, mononuclear cell counts and progenitor frequency in bone marrow and spleen, and Flt3-ligand, Erythropoietin, G-CSF and SDF-1 concentration in plasma remained unchanged when compared to control animals. Moreover, phenotypic analysis did not show any change in the proportions of bone marrow cell populations. These results indicate that, although (137)Cs was found in all organs implicated in the hematopoietic system, this did not induce any changes in bone marrow function.",M1

20151396,"Capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection with dual top-bottom cell configuration for microchip electrophoresis.An optimized capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector for microchip electophoresis is presented. The detector consists of a pair of top-bottom excitation electrodes and a pair of pickup electrodes disposed onto a very thin plastic microfluidic chip. The detection cell formed by the electrodes is completely encased and shielded in a metal housing. These approaches allow for the enhancement of signal coupling and extraction from the detection cell that result in an improved signal-to-noise-ratio and detection sensitivity. The improved detector performance is illustrated by the electrophoretic separation of six cations (NH(4) (+), K(+), Ca(2+), Na(+), Mg(2+), Li(+)) with a detection limit of approximately 0.3 microM and the analysis of the anions (Br(-), Cl(-), NO(2) (-), NO(3) (-), SO(4) (2-), F(-)) with a detection limit of about 0.15 microM. These LODs are significantly improved compared with previous reports using the conventional top-top electrode geometry.

20138075,"Post-ingestive signals and satiation of water and sodium intake of male rats.This study investigated the role of post-ingestive signals in the satiation of thirst or salt appetite. Post-ingestive signals, defined as those arising from the passage of fluid into the duodenum and proximal jejunum, were manipulated by implanting rats with gastric fistulas. After recovery, rats were water deprived and the following day gastric fistulas were opened (sham-<e>drinking</e>) or closed (control). Deprivation-induced thirst significantly increased water intake with sham-drinking rats consuming four-fold more than controls after 120 min access. Subsequently, rats were given sodium deficient chow for 48 h and the next day were administered furosemide and urine was collected. Twenty-four hours later, gastric fistulas were manipulated and rats were given water and 0.5M NaCl and intakes were measured. After 120 min of access, rats were sacrificed and plasma sodium (pNa) and plasma-renin-activity (PRA) were measured. Furosemide resulted in a loss of 2.2 mEq of sodium in urine and sham-drinking rats consumed significantly more water and 0.5M NaCl when compared to controls. At 120 min sham-drinking rats consumed 7.5 mEq of sodium nearly twice that of controls but had significantly lower pNa and significantly increased PRA. Interestingly, the ratio of water to 0.5M NaCl intake was similar in both groups, with each making a mixture of approximately 0.25 M NaCl. The results suggest that post-ingestive signals are necessary for the satiation of thirst and salt appetite.",M1
20102592,"Tap water use amongst pregnant women in a multi-ethnic cohort.BACKGROUND : Studies of disinfection by-products in <e>drinking</e> water and measures of adverse fetal growth have often been limited by exposure assessment lacking data on individual water use, and therefore failing to reflect individual variation in DBP exposure. METHODS : Pregnant women recruited to the Born in Bradford cohort study completed a questionnaire which covers water exposure. Information was collected on water consumption, showering, bathing and swimming. Water exposure data from a subset of 39 women of the cohort are described here. RESULTS : Mean total tap water intake was 1.8 l/day, and women on average spent 146 minutes per week showering and bathing. Most tap water intake occurred at home (100% for unemployed, 71.8% for employed). Differences between age groups were observed for total tap water intake overall (p = 0.02) and at home (p = 0.01), and for bottled water intake (p = 0.05). There were differences between ethnic groups for tap water intake at home (p = 0.02) and total tap water intake at work (p = 0.02). Total tap water intake at work differed by income category (p = 0.001). Duration per shower was inversely correlated with age (Spearman's correlation -0.39, p = 0.02), and differed according to employment status (p = 0.04), ethnicity (p = 0.02) and income (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION : This study provides estimates of water exposure in pregnant women in a multi-ethnic population in the north of England and suggests differences related to age, employment, income and ethnicity. The findings are valuable to inform exposure assessment in studies assessing the relationship between DBPs and adverse birth outcomes.",M1

The mice in the Ile group had an almost 6% lower body weight gain and 49% less epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) mass with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The hepatic and skeletal muscle triglyceride (TG) concentrations and degree of hyperinsulinemia in the Ile group mice were also lower than the control group by 38, 47, and 39%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). The WAT leptin concentration was also lower, whereas that of adiponectin was higher, in the Ile group compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The hepatic levels of protein CD36/fatty acid translocase, PPARalpha, and uncoupling protein (UCP) 2 and the levels of UCP3 in skeletal muscle were all greater in the Ile group than in the control mice (P &lt; 0.05). These results demonstrate that the liver and muscle TG concentrations are both lowered by Ile treatment. In addition, the PPARalpha and UCP expression levels in the mouse tissues were greater in the Ile group compared with the controls. Our current data thus suggest that supplementation with Ile might be useful in the treatment of metabolic syndrome.",M1
20082053,"Lower fluid and fruits/vegetable intake in questionable dementia among older Hong Kong Chinese.OBJECTIVE: Nutrition plays a role in the ageing process of the brain and suboptimal nutrient intake might precede clinical cognitive impairment. A diet high in fruits and vegetables has been recommended while little has been said about the influence of fluid intake in cognitive function. We examine the dietary pattern of community-dwelling older individuals with questionable dementia and compared that with normal individuals. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Community. Participants: 285 community-dwellers aged 60 or older. MEASUREMENTS: Dietary habits were recorded using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Questionable dementia was diagnosed by psychogeriatricians and relevant demographic and dietary factors were examined using univariate then multivariate analyses. RESULTS: 146 questionable dementia and 139 cognitively normal subjects were interviewed. Both groups were not at risk of malnutrition (MNA score 26.1 vs. 26.7 respectively, p = 0.02). The former were older, had fewer years of education, lower MMSE and ADAS-cog as well as lower MNA scores. In univariate analysis, questionable dementia was associated with decline in food intake and appetite, eating less vegetables and fruits, and <e>drinking</e> less fluid. After adjustment for age, gender and education level, eating &gt; 2 servings of vegetables / fruits per day (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.067, 0.973) and taking &gt; 5 cups of fluids per day (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.204, 0.792) was associated with a lower prevalence of questionable dementia. CONCLUSION: Older people with questionable dementia have lower intakes of vegetables, fruits and fluid than those who were cognitively normal. This may pose additional health risks, and increase their chance of progressing into dementia.",M1
20082033,"Evaluation of surface sampling techniques for collection of Bacillus spores on common <e>drinking</e> water pipe materials.Drinking water utilities may face biological contamination of the distribution system from a natural incident or deliberate contamination. Determining the extent of contamination or the efficacy of decontamination is a challenge, because it may require sampling of the wetted surfaces of distribution infrastructure. This study evaluated two sampling techniques that utilities might use to sample exhumed pipe sections. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), cement-lined ductile iron, and ductile iron pipe coupons (3 cm x 14 cm) cut from new water main piping were conditioned for three months in dechlorinated Cincinnati, Ohio tap water. Coupons were spiked with Bacillus atrophaeus subsp. globigii, a surrogate for Bacillus anthracis. Brushing and scraping were used to recover the inoculated spores from the coupons. Mean recoveries for all materials ranged from 37 +/- 30% to 43 +/- 20% for brushing vs. 24 +/- 10% to 51 +/- 29% for scraping. On cement-lined pipe, brushing yielded a significantly different recovery than scraping. No differences were seen between brushing and scraping the PVC and iron pipe coupons. Mean brushing and scraping recoveries from PVC coupons were more variable than mean recoveries from cement-lined and iron coupons. Spore retention differed between pipe materials and the presence of established biofilms also had an impact. Conditioned PVC coupons (with established biofilms) had significantly lower spore retention (31 +/- 11%) than conditioned cement-lined coupons (61 +/- 14%) and conditioned iron coupons (71 +/- 8%).",M1
20081258,"Effect of peptide and nonpeptide antagonists of angiotensin II receptors on noradrenaline release in hypothalamus of rats with angiotensin II-induced increase of water intake.Angiotensin II (Ang II) administered intracerebroventriculary (icv) at a dose that induces <e>drinking</e> behavior in rats significantly increased K(+)-stimulated release of [(3)H] noradrenaline (NA) in hypothalamus without affecting basal [(3)H] NA release. The observed difference between the effects of Ang II on basal and K(+)-stimulated [(3)H]NA release may possibly be due to the fact that peptides are released after increased neuronal activity. It can be suggested that Ang II is important primarily in pathological states and that NA plays a substantial role in the brain Ang II-induced drinking response. The imidazolic nonpeptidic compound 2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-{[2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl}imidazole potassium salt (DuP 753, losartan), its active metabolite 2-n-butyl-4-chloro-1-{[2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)- biphenyl-4-yl]methyl}imidazole-5-carboxylic acid (EXP 3174) and peptide Ang II analogue, sarmesin, antagonized the Ang II-induced effect on [(3)H]NA release, in spite of the differences in their chemical structures. Thus, the drugs tested inhibited K(+)-stimulated [(3)H]NA release in hypothalamus, acting via the angiotensin (AT)(1) receptor subtype. We could not reject the possibility of a non-receptor mechanism of action for DuP753, EXP3174 and sarmesin. This research allows us to suggest a neurochemical mechanism for the modulatory role of these drugs on the NA-ergic system. The Ang II receptor antagonists studied may become important therapeutic agents, which act preferentially on pathologically activated systems. These agents may be of use for the prevention of excessive ingestion of water in some neuropsychotic diseases.",M1
20077293,"Contribution of <e>drinking</e> water to dietary requirements of essential metals.Drinking water can be a source of essential metals, but only one study published thus far has compared the intake of essential metals in drinking water to dietary reference intakes. This assessment compares the ingestion of chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) from drinking water at the maximum concentrations that should be found in water, or at concentrations that are potentially more likely to be found in Canadian water, to the recommended dietary allowance or adequate intake values established by the Institute of Medicine. At guideline limits, water provides sufficient Cr and Cu to meet nutritional requirements, and Mn and Zn levels are sufficient for some age categories to meet nutritional requirements. At concentrations that are more likely to be found in Canadian water, adequate intakes for Cr and Mn may be met by water alone for bottle-fed infants, and water was estimated to provide 23-66% of daily Cu requirements. Drinking water might become a significant source of some essential metals in individuals whose diets are low in these metals, especially in the case of Cu.",M1
20060847,"Hunger and thirst: issues in measurement and prediction of eating and <e>drinking</e>.Associations between hunger and eating and between thirst and drinking are generally weak. This stems, in part, from limitations in the measurement of these sensations which generally rely on temporal, motivational, metabolic and/or self-reported descriptive indices. Each is critically reviewed. Also problematic is the fact that the deterministic depletion-repletion concept of ingestive behavior fails to account for influences of a multitude of contravening cognitive, social, sensory and logistical factors. Although hunger and thirst serve some parallel purposes, sharp distinctions are also present with health implications. Of particular note are the observations that thirst ratings are higher and more stable over the day compared to hunger and thirst may be more motivating to drink than hunger is to eat. Coupling these observations with evidence that beverages have limited satiety value, they pose particular challenges and opportunities. Beverages can facilitate the delivery of nutrients to those desiring or requiring them, but also to those where they are not desired or required. The benefits and risks are a function of their use rather than their inherent properties.",M1
20057194,"A simple dietary intervention in the school setting decreased incidence of overweight in children.OBJECTIVE: The study analyzed the effect of a combined environmental and educational intervention solely promoting water consumption on the incidence of overweight among school children. METHODS: 2,950 second and third graders of 32 elementary schools in socially deprived neighborhoods of two German cities participated in a randomized controlled intervention trial (August 2006-June 2007). In intervention schools (N = 17), water fountains were installed, each child received a water bottle, and teachers performed classroom lessons to promote water consumption. Control schools (N = 15) did not receive any intervention. Body heights and weights were measured at baseline and follow-up to assess the incidence and remission of overweight and obesity during follow-up. The water flow of the fountains was measured regularly during follow-up. Children's beverage consumption was self-reported in 24-hour recall questionnaires before and after intervention. RESULTS: After the intervention, the incidence of overweight was significantly lower in the intervention group (3.8%) than in the control group (6.0%, p = 0.018). Remission of overweight and obesity did not differ between the groups. Measured water flow of the fountains indicated a sustained use. CONCLUSION: A simple dietary intervention with the sole focus on the promotion of <e>drinking</e> water effectively reduced the incidence of overweight among school children.",M1
20056628,"Arsenic in <e>drinking</e> water and risk of urinary tract cancer: a follow-up study from northeastern Taiwan.The evidence linking arsenic in drinking water with increased urinary cancer risk comes from populations in relatively high exposure areas (&gt;100 microg/L), whereas studies from lower exposure areas (&lt;100 microg/L) reported inconsistent results. A previous study conducted in northeastern Taiwan, where residents were exposed to relatively lower concentrations, reported increased risk of urinary cancer in a dose-response way. Using the same cohort with longer follow-up, we conducted analysis to elucidate the relationship between ingested arsenic and urinary cancer in lower exposure groups and assessed the influence of duration, recency, and latency of drinking arsenic-containing well water. A total of 8,086 residents from northeastern Taiwan were followed for 12 years. Incident urinary cancer was ascertained through linkage with the national cancer registry. All analysis was done by Cox proportional hazards regression models. There were 45 incidences of urinary cancer and a monotonic increased risk of urinary cancer was found with increasing arsenic concentration (P &lt; 0.001). For the highly exposed (&gt;100 microg/L), the relative risks (RR) were &gt;5-fold, whereas the risk was elevated but not significant for low exposure (&lt;100 microg/L). Relative to the arsenic concentration &lt;10 microg/L, those who drank well water with higher concentration from birth [RR, 3.69; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.31-10.4], still drank at enrollment (RR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.33-9.22), and drank for &gt;50 years (RR, 4.12; 95% CI, 1.48-11.5) had a significantly increased risk of urinary cancer.

20004657,"Effect of pioglitazone on insulin resistance in fructose-<e>drinking</e> rats correlates with AGEs/RAGE inhibition and block of NADPH oxidase and NF kappa B activation.Insulin resistance, which may influence Alzheimer's disease, is associated with an increase in circulating advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) and the increased expression of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). Inhibition of AGE/RAGE system has been shown to attenuate neuronal damage. Specific ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), which have proven effective in the animal models of Alzheimer's disease and other neuroinflammatory diseases, have been shown to decrease RAGE expression. Here we investigated the effect of PPARgamma agonist, pioglitazone, on cognition function and AGE/RAGE system in a rodent model of insulin resistance, the fructose-drinking rats. Six-week-old male Wistar rats were fed a standard commercial diet and water without (control) or with 10% fructose for 16weeks. The animals were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10): non-treated and water-drinking rats (control group); pioglitazone-treated and water-drinking (control treatment group); non-treated and fructose-drinking rats (fructose group) and pioglitazone-treated and fructose-drinking rats (fructose treatment group). Pioglitazone was given at the dose of 10mg/kgd by gavage for the last 12weeks of the 16-week period. The results showed that pioglitazone treatment reduced the escape latency in Morris water maze test, decreased AGE/RAGE expression in the cerebral cortex of fructose-drinking rats. Furthermore, we found that the expression of p47phox component of NAPDH oxidase, phosphorylated nuclear factor NF-kappaB p65, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta was significantly increased in the cerebral cortex of fructose-drinking rats (P&lt;0.001). These effects were reversed by pioglitazone treatment (P&lt;0.01 or 0.001). Taken together, these findings suggest that the activation of AGEs-RAGE system contribute to the brain damage of insulin resistance. Pioglitazone administration can improve cognition function probably related to its effect of decreasing the activation of AGEs-RAGE system, which correlates with block of NAPDH oxidase and NF-kappaB activation in this rodent model of insulin resistance.",M1

19995243,"Effect of myrrh (Commiphora molmol) on leukocyte levels before and during healing from gastric ulcer or skin injury.Myrrh (Commiphora molmol) has been widely used as an anti-inflammatory and wound healing commercial product. As white blood cell (WBC)/leukocyte counts have been used as an indicator by clinicians to monitor progress of healing in patients, the purpose of this study was to examine effects of myrrh supplementation on blood WBC numbers before an injury and during healing. Male rats (7-8-wk-of-age) were randomly assigned to four groups. Group 1 (SIM) served as  skin injury treated + myrrh treatment (500 mg/kg/day),  Group 2 (SI) as  skin injury alone , Group 3 (GUM) as  gastric ulcer treated + myrrh treatment , and Group 4 (GU) as gastric ulcer only. Myrrh treatments (via <e>drinking</e> water) began 4 wk before induction of injury and continued for a 2 wk period post-injury. Baseline values for each WBC type were recorded before start of the myrrh treatments. Counts were performed again on Day 1 of the 5th wk (1-2 hr before injury) and post-injury on Days 4 and 7 of the 5th wk, and a final time on Day 4 of the 6th wk. Results showed that levels of all WBC types were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) elevated before either injury in myrrh-treated rats (Groups 1 and 3) as compared with levels in rats in Groups 2 and 4. At all timepoints, there were neither significant differences between the values seen with rats in Groups 1 and 3, nor between those in Groups 2 and 4. Treatment with myrrh also induced an initial increase in WBC levels that persisted through the post-injury healing period. Levels of most cell types only increased in the Group 2 and 4 rats once the injury was induced, but then declined over the healing period. Since myrrh enhanced WBC levels before injury, we conclude that myrrh likely contains substances that could induce an apparent antigen-driven response. As the myrrh also helped maintain elevated WBC levels throughout the healing period, this implied it was also able to induce maturation/differentiation/activation of both myeloid and lymphoid cell types during the effector phase of the immune responses involved in wound healing.",M1
19955272,"<e>Drinking</e> habits are associated with changes in the dental plaque microbial community.Caries and gingivitis are the most prevalent oral infectious diseases of humans and are due to the accumulation of dental plaque (a microbial biofilm) on the tooth surface and at the gingival margin, respectively. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that many natural components of foods and beverages inhibit the adhesion of and/or exert activity against oral bacteria. These biological activities have mainly been attributed to the polyphenol fraction. In order to explore the possibility that diet can alter the dental plaque community, in this study we evaluated the composition of the microbiota of supra- and subgingival plaque samples collected from 75 adult subjects with different drinking habits (drinkers of coffee, red wine, or water for at least 2 years) by analyzing the microbial population through the separation of PCR-amplified fragments using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique. The mean numbers of bands of the DGGE profiles from all three categories were evaluated. There were no significant differences between the two kinds of plaque collected from the control group (water drinkers), and this group showed the highest number of bands (supragingival plaque, 18.98 +/- 3.16 bands; subgingival plaque, 18.7 +/- 3.23 bands). The coffee and wine drinker groups generated the lowest numbers of bands for both supragingival plaque (coffee drinkers, 8.25 +/- 3.53 bands; wine drinkers, 7.93 +/- 2.55 bands) and subgingival plaque (coffee drinkers, 8.3 +/- 3.03 bands; wine drinkers, 7.65 +/- 1.68 bands). The differences between coffee drinkers or wine drinkers and the control group (water drinkers) were statistically significant. A total of 34 microorganisms were identified, and the frequency of their distribution in the three subject categories was analyzed. A greater percentage of subjects were positive for facultative aerobes when supragingival plaque was analyzed, while anaerobes were more frequent in subgingival plaque samples. It is noteworthy that the frequency of identification of anaerobes was significantly reduced when the frequencies for coffee and wine drinkers were compared with the frequencies for subjects in the control group. The DGGE profiles of the organisms in both plaque samples from all groups were generated and were used to construct dendrograms. A number of distinct clusters of organisms from water, coffee, and wine drinkers were formed. The clustering of some of the DGGE results into cohort-specific clusters implies similarities in the microbiotas within these groups and relevant differences in the microbiotas between cohorts. This supports the notion that the drinking habits of the subjects may influence the microbiota at both the supragingival and the subgingival levels.",M1
19941885,"Enhanced habituation and decreased anxiety by environmental enrichment and possible attenuation of these effects by chronic alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) in aging male and female rats.Middle-aged 330-day-old male and female hooded rats were group-housed for nearly 5 months in either standard cages, or in cages containing objects. Each cage also provided either pure water, or a solution of vitamin E (DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate) for <e>drinking</e>. Records were kept of averages for each cage of the rats' body weights and the volume of fluid/100g average body weight drunk. The average daily dose of tocopherol was approximately 162 and 173mg/kg for males and females respectively. Males (but not females) kept in enriched cages weighed less than those from standard cages. They also drank less fluid than females who also drank more tocopherol solution than males. When 490+days old, for rats provided with water, enrichment led to decreased open-field ambulation and increased within-session decrements in the response (habituation). Enrichment also led to decreased occupancy of the center of the apparatus for males only and, for all rats combined, increased grooming behavior. It was concluded that the effects of enrichment on aged rats were due to increased within-session habituation to novelty and decreased anxiety similar to what has been suggested for younger animals. Tocopherol appeared to interfere with effects of enrichment possibly because of pro-oxidant-related increased anxiety.",M1
19900689,"Chloramination of organophosphorus pesticides found in <e>drinking</e> water sources.The degradation of commonly detected organophosphorus (OP) pesticides, in drinking water sources, was investigated under simulated chloramination conditions. Due to monochloramine autodecomposition, it is difficult to observe the direct reaction of monochloramine with each OP pesticide. Therefore, a model was developed to examine the reaction of monochloramine (NH(2)Cl) and dichloramine (NHCl(2)) with chlorpyrifos (CP), diazinon (DZ), and malathion (MA). Monochloramine was found not to be very reactive with each OP pesticides, (k)NH(2)Cl,OP = 11-21 M(-1)h(-1). While, dichloramine (NHCl(2)) was found to be 2 orders of magnitude more reactive with each of the OP pesticides than monochloramine, (k)NHCl(2),OP = 2000-2900 M(-1)h(-1), which is still three orders of magnitude less than the hypochlorous acid reaction rate coefficient with each OP pesticide. For each pesticide, the reactivity of the three chlorinated oxidants was then found to correlate with half-wave potentials (E(1/2)) of each oxidant. With reaction rate coefficients for the three chlorinated oxidations as well as neutral and alkaline hydrolysis rate coefficients for the pesticides, the model was used to determine the dominant reaction pathways as a function of pH. At pH 6.5, OP pesticide transformation was mostly due to the reaction of hypochlorous acid and dichloramine. Above pH 8, alkaline hydrolysis or the direct reaction with monochloramine was the primary degradation pathway responsible for the transformation of OP pesticides. This demonstrates the ability of models to be used as tools to elucidate degradation pathways and parameterize critical reaction parameters when used with select yet comprehensive data sets.",M1

19880104,"Arsenic in public water supplies and cardiovascular mortality in Spain.BACKGROUND: High-chronic arsenic exposure in <e>drinking</e> water is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. At low-chronic levels, as those present in Spain, evidence is scarce. In this ecological study, we evaluated the association of municipal drinking water arsenic concentrations during the period 1998-2002 with cardiovascular mortality in the population of Spain. METHODS: Arsenic concentrations in drinking water were available for 1721 municipalities, covering 24.8 million people. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for cardiovascular (361,750 deaths), coronary (113,000 deaths), and cerebrovascular (103,590 deaths) disease were analyzed for the period 1999-2003. Two-level hierarchical Poisson models were used to evaluate the association of municipal drinking water arsenic concentrations with mortality adjusting for social determinants, cardiovascular risk factors, diet, and water characteristics at municipal or provincial level in 651 municipalities (200,376 cardiovascular deaths) with complete covariate information. RESULTS: Mean municipal drinking water arsenic concentrations ranged from &lt;1 to 118 microg/L. Compared to the overall Spanish population, sex- and age-adjusted mortality rates for cardiovascular (SMR 1.10), coronary (SMR 1.18), and cerebrovascular (SMR 1.04) disease were increased in municipalities with arsenic concentrations in drinking water &gt; 10 microg/L. Compared to municipalities with arsenic concentrations &lt; 1 microg/L, fully adjusted cardiovascular mortality rates were increased by 2.2% (-0.9% to 5.5%) and 2.6% (-2.0% to 7.5%) in municipalities with arsenic concentrations between 1-10 and &gt;10 microg/L, respectively (P-value for trend 0.032). The corresponding figures were 5.2% (0.8% to 9.8%) and 1.5% (-4.5% to 7.9%) for coronary heart disease mortality, and 0.3% (-4.1% to 4.9%) and 1.7% (-4.9% to 8.8%) for cerebrovascular disease mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this ecological study, elevated low-to-moderate arsenic concentrations in drinking water were associated with increased cardiovascular mortality at the municipal level. Prospective cohort studies with individual measures of arsenic exposure, standardized cardiovascular outcomes, and adequate adjustment for confounders are needed to confirm these ecological findings. Our study, however, reinforces the need to implement arsenic remediation treatments in water supply systems above the World Health Organization safety standard of 10 microg/L.",M1
19858168,"A novel water delivery system for administering volatile chemicals while minimizing chemical waste in rodent toxicity studies.Rodent toxicity studies typically use water bottles to administer test chemicals via <e>drinking</e> water. However, water bottles provide inconsistent exposure of volatile chemicals due to varying headspace, and lead to excessive waste of test material. To refine drinking water toxicity studies in rodents by enhancing sample quality and consistency, and minimizing waste, we designed and implemented a novel water delivery system that keeps the water chilled, headspace free and protected from light. Materials used were resistant to chemical interaction. In this gravity-fed system, a 6-L Teflon water bag, stored in a polystyrene cooler on the cage rack, was connected to a stainless steel manifold delivering water to five cages via specialized drinking valves. Due to the absence of headspace in the water bag, this system allows consistent exposure of volatile chemicals. In addition, small diameter tubing throughout the system reduces the amount of test material residing in the system and minimizes chemical waste.",M1

19846891,"Contribution of different triggers to the gastric accommodation reflex in humans.Accommodation of the stomach consists of a vagally mediated relaxation of the proximal stomach, providing the meal with a reservoir. Our aim was to study whether, similar to other vagally mediated processes, the accommodation reflex is also determined by cephalic, oropharyngeal, gastric, and intestinal phases. Eleven healthy subjects underwent in randomized order five gastric barostat studies and two satiety <e>drinking</e> tests. In all studies, isobaric tone measurements (at minimal distending pressure + 2 mmHg) were performed 20 min before and 20 min after a nutrient stimulus. The stimuli included only visual and olfactory exposure to a meal (cephalic stimulation), taking liquid nutrient in the mouth without swallowing (sham feeding), ingestion of a 200-ml 300-kcal nutrient meal with blocked outflow to the pylorus (gastric retention), and meal infusion through a nasointestinal tube (duodenal instillation), or normal ingestion (control). During satiety testing, subjects ingested liquid nutrient at a fixed rate of 15 ml/min until maximum satiety, with an inflated or deflated intrapyloric balloon assembly. Progressively bigger gastric relaxatory responses were seen with cephalic stimulation (18 +/- 19 ml), sham feeding (54 +/- 21 ml), gastric retention (95 +/- 47), duodenal instillation (144 +/- 33), and control (232 +/- 33 ml). The amount of nutrient ingested at maximum satiety was significantly lower with an inflated intrapyloric balloon (1,223 +/- 103 vs. 1,392 +/- 124 ml, P &lt; 0.05). The accommodation reflex in humans lacks a cephalic phase, but it can be activated from the oropharynx, the stomach, and the duodenum. Blocking passage to the duodenum significantly decreases the amplitude of the accommodation reflex and induces early satiety.",M1

In order to identify at low level (10(-8) M) the presence of these odorous disinfection by-products in drinking water matrixes an analytical method was developed by using head space apparatus (HS) combined with a sorbent trap system linked to a GC with a mass spectrometer detector (HS/Trap/GC/MS). The analyses were carried out in three different drinking water supplies from the Paris area, during the four seasons. Free amino acids were monitored at the inlet of the plant. The odorous disinfection by-products were analyzed at the outlet of each drinking water treatment plant and the different distribution networks were connected to the corresponding plant. The results confirmed that the odorous chloraldimines are produced during chlorination of free amino acids in three different matrixes in different seasons throughout the year (N-chloroisobutaldimine; N-chloromethyl-2-butaldimine; N-chloromethyl-3-butaldimine (6-10 nM).

Weekly F intake, excretion and retention, and terminal plasma and femur F levels were determined. Dental fluorosis was evaluated clinically and by quantitative fluorescence (QF). Data were tested by two-way ANOVA. Although F intakes by the strains were similar, excretion by A/J mice was significantly higher due to greater urinary F excretion, which resulted in lower plasma and femur F levels. Compared with 129P3/J mice given 50 ppm F, significantly higher QF scores were recorded for A/J mice. In conclusion, these strains differ with respect to several features of F metabolism, and amelogenesis in the 129P3/J strain seems to be unaffected by high F exposure.",M1

METHODS: After familiarization, six trained [VO(2 peak) = 64 (SD 8) mL kg(-1) min(-1)] and six untrained [O(2 peak) = 45 (4) mL kg(-1) min(-1)] males cycled 40 min at 70%O(2 peak) while euhydrated or hypohydrated by 1.5-2.0% body mass (crossover design), before a 40-min work trial with euhydration or ad libitum <e>drinking</e> (in Hypohydration trial), in temperate conditions (24.3 degrees C, RH 50%, v(a) = 4.5 m s(-1)). Baseline hydration was by complete or partial rehydration from exercise+heat stress the previous evening. RESULTS: During constant workload, heart rate and its drift were increased in Hypohydration compared with Euhydration for Untrained [drift: 33 (11) vs. 24 beats min(-1) h(-1) (10), 95% CI 5-11] but not Trained [14 (3) vs. 13 beats min(-1) h(-1) (3), CI -2 to 3; P = 0.01 vs. Untrained]. Similarly, rectal temperature drift was faster in Hypohydration for Untrained only [by 0.57 degrees C h(-1) (0.25); P = 0.03 vs. Trained], concomitant with their reduced sweat rate (P = 0.05) and its relation to plasma osmolality (P = 0.03). Performance power tended to be reduced for Untrained (-13%, CI -35 to 2) and Trained (-7%, CI: -16 to 1), without an effect of fitness (P = 0.38). CONCLUSION: Mild hypohydration exacerbated cardiovascular and thermoregulatory strain and tended to impair endurance performance, but aerobic fitness attenuated the physiological effects.",M1
19799921,"Arcopallium, NMDA antagonists and ingestive behaviors in pigeons.This study investigated the effects of local injections of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione (DNQX, AMPA-kainate receptor antagonist, 0.8 and 2.7 nmol) and MK-801 (NMDA receptor antagonist, 1.8 and 6.0 nmol) into the nucleus taeniae of the amygdala (TnA) and the arcopallium intermedium (AI) on ingestive and non-ingestive behaviors in free-feeding pigeons. Injections of DNQX into the TnA or into the AI failed to consistently affect feeding behavior; DNQX vehicle (DMSO) affected <e>drinking</e> when injected into the TnA. MK-801 injections into the AI produced a delayed increase in food and water intake. In the TnA, MK-801 increased water intake in the first two hours after the treatment. These data indicate that glutamatergic circuits in arcopallial structures in the pigeon, comparable to the mammalian medial amygdala, are involved in the inhibitory control of ingestive behaviors, suggesting that this can represent a conserved functional attribute in the amniote prosencephalon.",M1
19785892,"[Acute myocarditis due to Coxsackie virus B3 in two infants]In the spring and summer of 2008 two seriously ill male infants were admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit. Initially, both had a fever, were <e>drinking</e> less and were pale complexioned. Physical examination revealed tachycardia, slow capillary filling and liver enlargement. Within a few hours, both infants developed circulatory and respiratory failure. A chest radiograph showed that the heart was enlarged and echocardiography revealed that the pump function of both ventricles was severely diminished. Myocarditis caused by Coxsackie virus B3 was diagnosed when the virus was demonstrated in serum and faeces. At the last follow-up, one infant still had severe pump function disorders, and the other one died. Coxsackie virus B3 is a non-polio enterovirus that usually causes mild clinical syndromes but is also associated with myocarditis and overwhelming, systemic neonatal infections. In neonates with mild symptoms one should be alert to progression to circulatory insufficiency, especially if the mother experiences a flu-like illness in the perinatal period. Early recognition of heart failure and adequate diagnostic testing for cardiotropic viruses is important as morbidity and mortality is considerable.",M1
19781771,"Evidence from knockout mice for distinct implications of neuropeptide-Y Y2 and Y4 receptors in the circadian control of locomotion, exploration, water and food intake.Members of the neuropeptide-Y (NPY) family acting via Y2 and/or Y4 receptors have been proposed to participate in the control of ingestive behaviour and energy homeostasis. Since these processes vary between day and night, we explored the circadian patterns of locomotor, exploratory and ingestive behaviour in mice with disrupted genes for Y2 (Y2-/-) or Y4 (Y4-/-) receptors. To this end, the LabMaster system was used and its utility for the analysis of changes in circadian activity and ingestion caused by gene knockout evaluated. Female animals, aged 27weeks on average, were housed singly in cages fitted with sensors for water and food intake and two infrared frames for recording ambulation and rearing under a 12h light/dark cycle for 4days. Relative to WT animals, diurnal locomotion, exploration, <e>drinking</e> and feeding were reduced, whereas nocturnal locomotion was enhanced in Y2-/- mice. In contrast, Y4-/- mice moved more but ate and drank less during the photophase, while they ate more and explored less during the scotophase. Both Y2-/- and Y4-/- mice weighed more than WT mice. These findings attest to a differential role of Y2 and Y4 receptor signalling in the circadian control of behaviours that balance energy intake and energy expenditure. These phenotypic traits can be sensitively and continuously recorded by the LabMaster system.",M1
19778263,"Co-administration of monoisoamyl dimercaptosuccinic acid and Moringa oleifera seed powder protects arsenic-induced oxidative stress and metal distribution in mice.Arsenic contamination of groundwater in the West Bengal basin in India is unfolding as one of the worst natural geo-environmental disasters to date. Chelation therapy with chelating agents is considered to be the best known treatment against arsenic poisoning; however, they are compromised with certain serious drawbacks/side-effects. Efficacy of combined administration of Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) (English: Drumstick tree) seed powder, a herbal extract, with a thiol chelator monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA) post-arsenic exposure in mice was studied. Mice were exposed to 100 ppm arsenic in <e>drinking</e> water for 6 months, followed by 10-days treatment with M. oleifera seed powder (500 mg/kg, orally through gastric gavage, once daily), MiADMSA (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, once daily) either individually or in combination. Arsenic exposure caused significant decrease in blood glutathione, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), accompanied by increased production of reactive oxygen species in blood and soft tissues. Significant inhibition of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities in tissues (liver in particular) along with significant increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and metallothionein levels in arsenic intoxicated mice was also noted. Combined administration of MiADMSA with M. oleifera proved better than all other treatments in the recovery of most of the above parameters accompanied by more pronounced depletion of arsenic. The results suggest that concomitant administration of M. oleifera during chelation treatment with MiADMSA might be a better treatment option than monotherapy with the thiol chelator in chronic arsenic toxicity.",M1
19771282,"Electrolyte and plasma changes after ingestion of pickle juice, water, and a common carbohydrate-electrolyte solution.CONTEXT: Health care professionals advocate that athletes who are susceptible to exercise-associated muscle cramps (EAMCs) should moderately increase their fluid and electrolyte intake by <e>drinking</e> sport drinks. Some clinicians have also claimed drinking small volumes of pickle juice effectively relieves acute EAMCs, often alleviating them within 35 seconds. Others fear ingesting pickle juice will enhance dehydration-induced hypertonicity, thereby prolonging dehydration. OBJECTIVE: To determine if ingesting small quantities of pickle juice, a carbohydrate-electrolyte (CHO-e) drink, or water increases plasma electrolytes or other selected plasma variables. DESIGN: Crossover study. SETTING: Exercise physiology laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Nine euhydrated, healthy men (age = 25 +/- 2 years, height = 179.4 +/- 7.2 cm, mass = 86.3 +/- 15.9 kg) completed the study. INTERVENTION(S): Resting blood samples were collected preingestion (-0.5 minutes); immediately postingestion (0 minutes); and at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 minutes postingestion of 1 mL/kg body mass of pickle juice, CHO-e drink, or tap water. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Plasma sodium concentration, plasma magnesium concentration, plasma calcium concentration, plasma potassium concentration, plasma osmolality, and changes in plasma volume were analyzed. Urine specific gravity, osmolality, and volume were also measured to characterize hydration status. RESULTS: Mean fluid intake was 86.3 +/- 16.7 mL. Plasma sodium concentration, plasma magnesium concentration, plasma calcium concentration, plasma osmolality, and plasma volume did not change during the 60 minutes after ingestion of each fluid (P &gt;or= .05). Water ingestion slightly decreased plasma potassium concentration at 60 minutes (0.21 +/- 0.14 mg/dL [0.21 +/- 0.14 mmol/L]; P &lt;or= .05). CONCLUSIONS: At these volumes, ingestion of pickle juice and CHO-e drink did not cause substantial changes in plasma electrolyte concentrations, plasma osmolality, or plasma volume in rested, euhydrated men. Concern that ingesting these volumes of pickle juice might exacerbate an athlete's risk of dehydration-induced hypertonicity may be unwarranted. If EAMCs are caused by large electrolyte loss due to sweating, these volumes of pickle juice or CHO-e drink are unlikely to restore any deficit incurred by exercise.",M1
19770677,"Homozygous TRPV1 315C influences the susceptibility to functional dyspepsia.OBJECTIVES: Capsaicin/vanilloid (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, (TRPV1) receptor has been shown to be expressed in gastrointestinal tract and play a role as a member of sensory ion channel superfamily. The G315C polymorphism affects the TRPV1 gene and alters its protein level. We aimed to investigate the effect of TRPV1 G315C polymorphism on functional dyspepsia (FD) in a Japanese population. METHODS: TRPV1 G315C polymorphism was genotyped in 98 subjects with no upper abdominal symptoms and 109 patients with FD. Severity of 7 upper gastrointestinal symptoms was assessed during cold water, and cold carbonated water <e>drinking</e> for randomly selected 20 healthy subjects. RESULTS: We found a significant inverse association between TRPV1 315CC genotype and FD [CC vs. others; odds ratio (OR)=0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.38-0.82]. We also found that the same genotype held a lower risk of both epigastric pain syndrome (OR=0.25, 95% CI=0.09-0.73), postprandial syndrome (OR=0.27, 95% CI=0.07-0.96) according to Rome III, and Helicobacter pylori positive FD (OR=0.28, 95% CI=0.10-0.79). The evolution of symptom severity scale of 7 total symptoms (P=0.004), and heavy feeling in stomach (P=0.02) during cold carbonated water drinking were significantly lower among 315CC genotypes compared with others. CONCLUSIONS: Homozygous TRPV1 315C influences the susceptibility to FD through altering the upper gastrointestinal sensation.",M1
19767329,"The effects of subchronic lithium administration in male Wistar mice on some biochemical parameters.Lithium salts are efficiently used for treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, prolonged treatment frequently involves adverse side effects. In this study, effects of lithium carbonate administration on some biochemical parameters were studied in male mice. Lithium carbonate (20, 40, or 80 mg/kg body weight corresponding to 3.77, 7.54, or 15.08 mg Li element/kg body weight, respectively) was injected daily for 14 or 28 days. The following parameters were recorded: <e>drinking</e> water consumption, body weight, lithium and testosterone serum concentrations, activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide-dismutase (SOD), and glutathione-peroxidase (GPX), and level of lipid peroxidation (expressed as TBARS) in liver was performed. Lithium treatment, especially at the highest dose for 28 days, was found to induce weight gain and polydipsia and a significant decrease of plasma testosterone level. Lipid peroxidation level and activities of SOD and GPX were increased in liver, which suggests a perturbation of the antioxidative status. Our results indicate that subchronic exposure to lithium, which induces weight gain and polydipsia under our experimental conditions, also damages the male reproductive system and triggers an oxidative stress in the liver.",M1
19766145,"The aromatase inhibitor 1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione (ATD) reduces disinhibitory behavior in intact adult male rats treated with a high dose of testosterone.Anabolic androgenic steroids and high testosterone doses have been reported to induce impulsive behavior in man and behavioral disinhibition in rats. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether aromatization of testosterone to estradiol is of importance for the behavioral disinhibiting effect of a high testosterone dose in adult male rats. Testosterone administered via five testosterone-filled silastic capsules implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) to non-castrated, group-housed rats for six days induced behavioral disinhibition in a modified Vogel's <e>drinking</e> conflict model and yielded supraphysiological serum levels of testosterone and increased accessory sex organ weights. Moreover, concurrent administration of the aromatase inhibitor 1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione (ATD; 60 mg/kg/day s.c.) decreased behavioral disinhibition in testosterone-treated rats (without affecting accessory sex organ weights) while behavior was not significantly affected in sham-treated animals. Since some reports indicate that ATD, in addition to inhibit aromatase, also may affect the binding of testosterone to the androgen receptor, the effect of the non-steroidal androgen receptor antagonist flutamide was investigated. Flutamide treatment did not affect disinhibited behavior in testosterone-treated rats. However, in sham-treated animals, flutamide (50mg/kg/day) produced behavioral disinhibition. These results suggest that estradiol is of importance in the mechanisms underlying behavioral disinhibition in non-castrated rats treated with a high testosterone dose. Speculatively, aromatization may be involved in pro-impulsive effects of high testosterone doses in humans.",M1
19762810,"The effect of dystocia on the dry matter intake and behavior of Holstein cows.Dairy cows that have a difficult calf delivery (dystocia) are more likely to develop health complications after calving, reducing productivity and welfare. Understanding the behavioral cues of dystocia may facilitate prompt obstetric assistance and reduce the long-term effect of the challenging delivery. The aim of this study was to describe the effects of dystocia on dairy cow behavior during the period around calving and to assess the use of these behaviors as potential indicators of dystocia. Individual dry matter intake, water intake, feeding and <e>drinking</e> time, meal size, standing time, and number of transitions from standing to lying positions (bouts) were recorded during the 48-h period before and after the time of calf delivery for 22 Holstein cows [11 cows with dystocia and 11 cows with unassisted delivery (eutocia)]. Cows with dystocia consumed 1.9 kg less during the 48 h before calving compared with cows with eutocia (14.3 +/- 1.0 vs. 16.2 +/- 1.0 kg, respectively), and this difference increased to 2.6 kg in the 24 h before calving (8.3 +/- 0.7 vs. 10.9 +/- 0.7 kg/d). There were no differences in drinking time between the groups, but cows with dystocia consumed less water 24 h before calving (22.4 +/- 4.4 vs. 36.2 +/- 4.4 kg/d, respectively) and consumed more water during the 24-h period after calving (56.9 +/- 3.1 vs. 48.7 +/- 3.1 kg/d) compared with cows with eutocia. Cows with dystocia transitioned from standing to lying positions more frequently than cows without dystocia beginning 24 h before calving (10.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 8.3 +/- 0.7 bouts/d). Dry matter intake and standing bouts in the 24 h before calving were the most accurate variables in discriminating between cows with and without dystocia, suggesting that cows with dystocia begin to alter their behavior beginning 24 h before calving.",M1
19760484,"Centrally administered ghrelin potently inhibits water intake induced by angiotensin II and hypovolemia in rats.Ghrelin is a potent, centrally acting orexigenic hormone. Recently, we showed that centrally administered ghrelin is a potent antidipsogenic hormone in 24-h water deprived rats. In this study, we examined the effect of intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of ghrelin on angiotensin II (AII)-induced water intake in rats. We also examined the effects of icv injection of ghrelin on <e>drinking</e> induced by intraperitoneal injection of an isotonic polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution that causes isotonic hypovolemia. Water intake induced by the icv injection of AII or ip injection of PEG was significantly reduced after icv injection of ghrelin, although food intake was stimulated by the hormone. The drinking induced by AII was also inhibited by the icv administration of 4alpha-phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate, an agonist of the osmosensitive TRPV4 channel. This study showed that ghrelin is a potent antidipsogenic peptide by antagonizing general dipsogenic mechanisms including those activated by AII and hypovolemia in rats.",M1
19759454,"Comparison of biological activated carbon (BAC) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) for pollutants removal in <e>drinking</e> water treatment.Biological activated carbon (BAC) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) were systematically compared for the drinking water treatment from slightly polluted raw water under the same hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 0.5 h. MBR exhibited excellent turbidity removal capacity due to the separation of the membrane; while only 60% of influent turbidity was intercepted by BAC. Perfect nitrification was achieved by MBR with the 89% reduction in ammonia; by contrast, BAC only eliminated a moderate amount of influent ammonia (by 54.5%). However, BAC was able to remove more dissolved organic matter (DOM, especially for organic molecules of 3,000 approximately 500 Daltons) and corresponding disinfection by-product formation potential (DBPFP) in raw water than MBR. Unfortunately, particulate organic matter (POM) was detected in the BAC effluent. On the other hand, BAC and MBR displayed essentially the same capacity for biodegradable organic matter (BOM) removal. Fractionation of DOM showed that the removal efficiencies of hydrophobic neutrals, hydrophobic acids, weakly hydrophobic acids and hydrophilic organic matter through BAC treatment were 11.7%, 8.8%, 13.9% and 4.8% higher than that through MBR; while MBR achieved 13.8% higher hydrophobic bases removal as compared with BAC.",M1
19759446,"<e>Drinking</e> water from alternative water sources: differences in beliefs, social norms and factors of perceived behavioural control across eight Australian locations.Australia is facing serious challenges in the management of water in various urban and regional locations. Two popular responses to these challenges are increasing supply through alternative water sources such as recycled and desalinated water. However, significant gaps exist in our knowledge of community attitudes to these alternative sources of water, particularly for potable use. This paper reports results from an Australian study of community attitudes to alternative water sources. Sixty six qualitative interviews were held at eight locations with distinctly different water situations. This paper explores all three antecedents to the behaviour of drinking recycled water and desalinated water as postulated by the Theory of Planned Behaviour: attitudes, social norms and factors of perceived behavioural control. Key results indicate that while people hold both positive and negative beliefs (mostly cost, health and environmental concerns) about water from alternative sources, nearly all of them are willing to drink it if the water crisis were to deteriorate further. People also feel they lack knowledge and state that information from scientists would influence their decision to drink recycled and desalinated water most. Friends and relatives are most influential in preventing people from drinking recycled water. The findings reported in this paper have major implications for water policy, and will be of particular interest to water engineers. The paper raises a provocative question: Is it better to avoid public consultation in introducing water from alternative sources?",M1
19759440,"Acquiring reproducible fluorescence spectra of dissolved organic matter at very low concentrations.A method that would allow for fast and reliable measurements of dissolved organic matter (DOM), both at low and high concentration levels would be a valuable tool for online monitoring of DOM. This could have applications in a variety of areas including membrane treatment systems for <e>drinking</e> water applications which is of interest to our group. In this study, the feasibility of using fluorescence spectroscopy for monitoring DOM at very low concentration levels was demonstrated with an emphasis on optimizing the instrument parameters necessary to obtain reproducible fluorescence signals. Signals were acquired using a cuvette or a fibre optic probe assembly, the latter which may have applications for on-line or in-line monitoring. The instrument parameters such as photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage, scanning rate and slit width were studied in detail to find the optimum parameter settings required. The results showed that larger excitation and emission slit widths were preferred, over larger PMT voltage or lower scanning rates, to obtain reproducible and rapid measurements when measuring very low concentration levels of DOM. However, this approach should be implemented with caution to avoid any reduction of the signal resolution.",M1
19751752,"Gastric emptying and intestinal absorption of ingested water and saline by hypovolemic rats.Recent experiments showed that in a one-bottle test conducted 16h after sc injection of polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution, hypovolemic rats consumed water or 0.30 M NaCl in an initial <e>drinking</e> episode but did not empty the ingested fluid from the stomach or absorb it from the small intestine very rapidly, certainly not as rapidly as when 0.15M NaCl was consumed (Smith et al., Am J Physiol 292: R2089-R2099, 2007). The present experiments examined the patterns of water and 0.30 M NaCl ingestion and the movement of consumed fluid through the gastrointestinal tract when PEG-treated rats were given a two-bottle delayed-access test. We found that both fluids always were consumed in the first drinking episode, that the fluid mixture ingested was equivalent to 0.10-0.15M NaCl, and that gastric emptying rate and net fluid absorption from the small intestine usually were much faster than when PEG-treated rats drank either water or hypertonic saline alone. Thus, ingestion of water and 0.30 M NaCl by hypovolemic rats in the same episode adaptively facilitated the movement into the circulation of a near-isotonic fluid that is ideal for restoring plasma volume deficits.",M1
19722439,"Children's <e>drinking</e> water: parental preferences and implications for fluoride exposure.PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to: describe children's drinking water sources; determine if any demographic factors are associated with water choice; describe parents' reasons for selecting bottled water; and determine parents' ability to provide enough information about their drinking water for providers to assess children's fluoride exposure. METHODS: Subjects were parents of children 6 months to 15-years-old. A questionnaire was verbally administered in English or Spanish. Chi-square analyses were used to evaluate associations among study variables. RESULTS: Of 194 parents, 134 (69%) gave their children bottled water either exclusively or with tap water. Bottled water use was not significantly associated with the primary source of tap water, parent's education level, or household income. Reasons for giving children bottled water included: fear of contaminants in tap water; taste and/or smell of tap water; and convenience of bottled water. For parents using bottled water, over 65% did not know the brand's fluoride content. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to an accurate fluoride assessment include frequent bottled water use and parental uncertainty about its fluoride content. By initiating communication with parents and educating them about fluoride sources, health care and dental providers may be able to better evaluate the adequacy of children's fluoride exposure and decide whether fluoride supplementation is necessary.",M1
19720249,"Malingering dysphagia and odynophagia electromyographic assessment.OBJECTIVE: The article discusses the usefulness and investigation technique of suspected malingering dysphagia/odynophagia by surface electromyography (sEMG) of deglutition. METHODS: Forty patients with suspected malingering dysphagia (group 1), 40 patients with dysphagia/odynophagia due to tonsillectomy (group 2), and 40 healthy individuals (group 3) were involved in the study. The timing, amplitude, and graphic patterns of activity of the masseter, submental, and trapezius muscles were examined during voluntary single water swallows ( normal ) and continuous <e>drinking</e> of 100 mL of water. The muscle activity in oral, pharyngeal, and initial esophageal stages of swallowing was measured, and graphic records were evaluated in relation to timing and voltage. RESULTS: The main sEMG patterns of malingering dysphagia/odynophagia are prolonged time of the voluntary oral phase of a swallow (80% of cases, n = 32, P &lt; .01 vs healthy volunteers) with normal timing of the reflex pharyngeal and initial esophageal phases and normal amplitude voltage. In 42.5% of cases (n = 17, P &lt; .05 vs healthy volunteers), tension of skeletal muscles normally not involved in deglutition was observed during single swallowing being at the same time absent during continuous drinking. CONCLUSION: Dysphagia due to malingering has no pathologic sEMG patterns associated with deglutition. Skeletal muscle tension during deglutition, being observed in some cases, has no connection with the act of swallowing itself. Prolonged oral phase of a swallow is factitious, nonpathologic. Surface EMG, being noninvasive, nonradiographic and inexpensive, can be used for patients with suspected malingering dysphagia, thus avoiding expensive and time-consuming investigation.",M1

Plain water was reported by 28.1% of participants on the day of registry. Quantities consumed ranged from 250 to 2250 ml. For the 449 one-day intake records, a cumulative total of 62,000 mL of water consumption was reported. This constitutes an average of 138+/-289 ml across all participants but, when divided by for water consumers only, the mean is 492+/-352 ml.

19684272,"<e>Drinking</e> behavior in nursery pigs: determining the accuracy between an automatic water meter versus human observers.Assimilating accurate behavioral events over a long period can be labor-intensive and relatively expensive. If an automatic device could accurately record the duration and frequency for a given behavioral event, it would be a valuable alternative to the traditional use of human observers for behavioral studies. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the accuracy in the time spent at the waterer and the number of visits to the waterer by individually housed nursery pigs between human observers scoring video files using Observer software (OBS) and an automatic water meter Hobo (WM, control) affixed onto the waterline. Eleven PIC USA genotype gilts (22 +/- 2 d of age; 6.5 +/- 1.4 kg of BW) were housed individually in pens with ad libitum access to a corn-based starter ration and one nipple waterer. Behavior was collected on d 0 (day of weaning), 7, and 14 of the trial using 1 color camera positioned over 4 attached pens and a RECO-204 DVR at 1 frame per second. For the OBS method, 2 experienced observers recorded drinking behavior from the video files, which was defined as when the gilt placed her mouth over the nipple waterer. Data were analyzed using nonparametric methods and the general linear model and regression procedures in SAS. The experimental unit was the individual pen housing 1 gilt. The GLM model included the method of observation (WM vs. OBS) and time (24 h) as variables, and the gilt nested within method was used as the error term. Gilts consumed more water (P = 0.04) on d 14 than on d 0. The time of day affected (P &lt; 0.001) the number of visits and the time spent at the waterer regardless of the method. However, the OBS method underestimated (P &lt; 0.001) the number of visits to the waterer (3.48 +/- 0.33 visits/h for OBS vs. 4.94 +/- 0.33 for WM) and overestimated (P &lt; 0.001) the time spent at the waterer (22.6 +/- 1.46 s/h for OBS vs. 13.9 +/- 1.43 for WM) compared with WM. The relationship between the 2 methods for prediction of time spent at the waterer and number of visits made by the gilts was weak (R(2) = 0.56 and 0.69, respectively). Collectively, these data indicate that the use of the traditional OBS method for quantifying drinking behavior in pigs can be misleading. Quantifying drinking behavior and perhaps other behavioral events via the OBS method must be more accurately validated.",M1

With this study we investigated if open water drinkers can affect behaviour and health of ducks positively. In this investigation ten fattening trials with 11 424 ducks, kept with straw, were analyzed. 25% of the compartment (32 m2) were covered with perforated grid, with one of the tested water systems (Nipple drinker, Sparkcup, Shower, Hollow and Round drinker and modified Round drinker) installed. Besides parts of the behaviour of ducks, animal health and hygiene and also economic factors were taken into account. In contrast to pens with nipple-drinkers only, the ducks in pens with open water troughs/showers had the opportunity to exhibit their natural <e>drinking</e> behaviour and water associated activities, such as straining and preening the plumage with water in accordance with the animal welfare requirements. In the free-choice pens, the open water systems were significantly preferred, and over a 24-hour period, the ducks in watering areas with open water troughs showed higher activity. Limiting the access to the open water systems (4, 6 and 8 hours) led to more intense use per time unit. Ducks with access to nipple drinkers only showed a significantly higher percentage of plugged up nostrils than animals from pens with open water drinkers (p &lt; or = 0.05). Open water drinkers also had a positive impact on the plumage condition.The open water drinking systems were very well accepted by the animals and are, concerning behaviour and animal health, an improvement in housing systems of Peking ducks.",M1

Part 4: Copper.The aim of this study was to assess exposure of children to copper (Cu) from household drinking water (DW). DW samples were collected between 1997 and 2004 in approximately 650 households and pre-schools using a double-sampling method (morning - W1; evening - W2). The study group comprised approximately 300 children (5-7 years old) living in Krakow (urban, peripheral) and rural areas in southern Poland. Cu concentrations were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. There was no significant relationship between the sampling period and Cu concentration, but statistically significant differences were found between urban and non-urban (rural, peripheral) sites and between morning and evening samples. Geometric means of Cu concentration in evening DW (95% confidence interval, in microg L(-1)) were 8 (1-110), 20 (1-274) and 12 (0-364) in urban, peripheral and rural sites, respectively. DW contamination after overnight standing was comparable in all sites (average increase approximately 20 microg Cu L(-1)). The adopted threshold of 100 microg Cu L(-1) was exceeded in evening DW by 3.6 and 15% in urban and non-urban households, respectively. Exceedance of the EC limit (2 mg L(-1)) was not significant. The mean predicted contribution of evening DW to Cu intake by children were 18-37 microg day(-1) or 0.8-1.6 microg kg(-1) bw day(-1) but were 2-3-fold higher for morning DW. The Polish RDA (1 mg Cu day(-1)) was exceeded for morning (evening) DW in 3.7 (0.2)% of children, with a mean intake of 159 (118)% of RDA. The observed copper levels and predicted intakes can be considered low and should not raise nutritional or toxicological concerns for the age group studied. Nevertheless, due to overnight contamination, the suggestion that the stagnant portion of drinking water should be discarded remains valid.",M1
19668954,"Reproducibility of water <e>drinking</e> test performed at different times of the day.PURPOSE: To evaluate the reproducibility of water drinking test (WDT) performed at different times of the day, in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients and normal individuals. METHODS: Fifteen patients with POAG and 30 normal individuals underwent three WDTs at different times of the day (7 AM, 12 PM, and 5 PM) on 3 different days. Test results in POAG patients and normal individuals were compared. Agreement and correlation of intraocular pressure (IOP) baseline levels, peak levels, and IOP change (peak IOP--baseline IOP) on tests performed at different times were evaluated. Only right eye measurements were analyzed. RESULTS: Mean baseline IOP, peak IOP and IOP change were significantly higher in POAG patients than in normal individuals, at all time intervals (p&lt;0.05). The Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated limits of agreement for IOP peak levels and IOP changes larger than the clinically acceptable (&gt;3 mmHg), even though Pearson's test revealed good correlation among the results. CONCLUSION: The mean IOP peak and mean IOP change observed during WDT are significantly higher in POAG patients than in control individuals. Low levels of agreement among WDTs performed at different times of the day suggest a poor reproducibility of WDT, which may limit its applicability for the diagnosis and follow-up of glaucoma.",M1
19650703,"Water-flow variation and pharmacoepidemiology of tetracycline hydrochloride administration via <e>drinking</e> water in swine finishing farms.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate variation of drinking-water flow rates in swine finishing barns and the relationship between drinker flow rate and plasma tetracycline concentrations in pigs housed in different pens. DESIGN: Cross-sectional (phase 1) and cohort (phase 2) studies. SAMPLE POPULATION: 13 swine finishing farms (100 barns with 7,122 drinkers) in phase 1 and 100 finishing-stage pigs on 2 finishing farms (1 barn/farm) in phase 2. PROCEDURES: In phase 1, farms were evaluated for water-flow variation, taking into account the following variables: position of drinkers within the barn, type of drinker (swing or mounted), pig medication status, existence of designated sick pen, and existence of leakage from the waterline. In phase 2, blood samples were collected from 50 pigs/barn (40 healthy and 10 sick pigs) in 2 farms at 0, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours after initiation of water-administered tetracycline HCl (estimated dosage, 22 mg/kg [10 mg/lb]). Plasma tetracycline concentrations were measured via ultraperformance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean farm drinker flow rates ranged from 1.44 to 2.77 L/min. Significant differences in flow rates existed according to drinker type and whether tetracycline was included in the water. Mean drinker flow rates and plasma tetracycline concentrations were significantly different between the 2 farms but were not different between healthy and sick pigs. The plasma tetracycline concentrations were typically &lt; 0.3 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Many factors affected drinker flow rates and therefore the amount of medication pigs might have received. Medication of pigs with tetracycline through water as performed in this study had questionable therapeutic value.",M1

19632276,"Tonic serotonergic control of ingestive behaviours in the pigeon (Columba livia): the role of the arcopallium.This study examined the acute changes in feeding and <e>drinking</e> behaviours of free-feeding and free-drinking pigeons, in response to local injections of metergoline (MET, 5-HT(1/2) receptor antagonist; 7 and 20 nmol), GR46611 (GR, 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist; 2 and 6 nmol) or vehicle, into two components of the arcopallium: the nucleus taeniae of the amygdala (TnA) and the arcopallium intermedium (AI). In the TnA, the highest MET dose elicited a short-lived hyperphagy, without affecting drinking or non-ingestive behaviours during the first hour after injection. In contrast, all MET doses promptly increased drinking when injected in the AI, without affecting feeding; this effect was still evident 3 and 24 h after the treatment. When injected in the TnA, the highest GR dose promptly increased both food and water intake; these effects persisted 24 h after the treatments. GR injections in the AI evoked long-lasting increases in drinking, but not in feeding. Injections of these drugs into other arcopallial nuclei evoked no significant ingestive effects. These data indicate the presence of a tonic inhibitory influence of serotonergic inputs, partially mediated by 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors, on feeding- and drinking-related TnA circuits and on mechanisms controlling drinking in the AI. Compared to data from the rodent medial amygdala, our results suggest that a tonic inhibitory 5-HTergic control of feeding (but not drinking) behaviour, mediated by 5-HT(1/2) receptors and exerted in the medial amygdaloid area, may represent a broadly conserved functional attribute in the amniote brain, but probably involves many important taxa-specific neural mechanisms.",M1
19625993,"V1/V2 Vasopressin receptor antagonism potentiates the renoprotection of renin-angiotensin system inhibition in rats with renal mass reduction.Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the standard treatment for chronic proteinuric nephropathy, slows but may not halt progression of the disease, particularly when therapy is started late. Because vasopressin may also play a role in the progression of renal disease, we measured the effect of a dual V(1a) and V(2) vasopressin receptor antagonist (RWJ-676070) alone or combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade on proteinuria and renal disease progression during overt nephropathy. Twenty-one days after renal mass reduction, a time of established injury, rats were given vehicle, RWJ-676070, enalapril, losartan, RWJ-676070 plus enalapril, or losartan in <e>drinking</e> water for an additional 39 days. RWJ-676070 returned the blood pressure to pre-treatment levels, which were significantly lower than those in vehicle-treated rats. Enalapril, losartan, and the combined therapies reduced blood pressure to a greater extent. RWJ-676070 afforded a partial antiproteinuric effect, which was enhanced by the addition of enalapril or losartan. Renal functional impairment, and glomerular and tubular changes were partially ameliorated by RWJ-676070; parameters significantly improved with either enalapril or losartan alone and improved to a greater extent with the combined therapies. Our findings suggest that vasopressin receptor antagonists could be of additional therapeutic value in the treatment of chronic proteinuric nephropathy.",M1
19616566,"Differential effects of estradiol on <e>drinking</e> by ovariectomized rats in response to hypertonic NaCl or isoproterenol: Implications for hyper- vs. hypo-osmotic stimuli for water intake.We examined the effects of estradiol on behavioral responses to osmotic challenges in ovariectomized (OVX) rats to test the hypothesis that estradiol enhances sensitivity to gradual changes in plasma osmolality (pOsm) in stimulating water intake. Despite comparably elevated pOsm after a slow infusion of 2 M NaCl, the latency to begin water intake was significantly less in estradiol-treated OVX rats compared to that in oil vehicle-treated rats. Other groups of OVX rats were injected with isoproterenol, which increases circulating angiotensin II. These rats then were given 0.15 M NaCl to drink instead of water, to prevent decreased pOsm associated with water ingestion. Isoproterenol stimulated 0.15 M NaCl intake by both groups; however, estradiol-treated rats consumed less 0.15 M NaCl than did oil-treated rats, findings that are similar to those reported when estradiol-treated rats consumed water. The estradiol enhancement of sensitivity to increased, but not to decreased, pOsm suggests that estradiol has directionally-specific effects on osmoregulatory drinking. Moreover, the estradiol attenuation of 0.15 M NaCl intake after isoproterenol suggests that estradiol effects on osmoregulatory drinking are independent of those on volume regulatory drinking.",M1

19604408,"Effectiveness and cost of recruitment strategies for a community-based randomised controlled trial among rainwater drinkers.BACKGROUND: Community-based recruitment is challenging particularly if the sampling frame is not easily defined as in the case of people who drink rainwater. Strategies for contacting participants must be carefully considered to maximise generalisability and minimise bias of the results. This paper assesses the recruitment strategies for a 1-year double-blinded randomised trial on <e>drinking</e> untreated rainwater. The effectiveness of the recruitment strategies and associated costs are described. METHODS: Community recruitment of households from Adelaide, Australia occurred from February to July 2007 using four methods: electoral roll mail-out, approaches to schools and community groups, newspaper advertising, and other media involvement. Word of mouth communication was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 810 callers were screened, with 53.5% eligible. Of those who were eligible and sent further information, 76.7% were willing to participate in the study and 75.1% were enrolled. The target for recruitment was 300 households, and this was achieved. The mail-out was the most effective method with respect to number of households randomised, while recruitment via schools had the highest yield (57.3%) and was the most cost effective when considering cost per household randomised (AUD$147.20). Yield and cost effectiveness were lowest for media advertising. CONCLUSION: The use of electoral roll mail-out and advertising via schools were effective in reaching households using untreated rainwater for drinking. Employing multiple strategies enabled success in achieving the recruitment target. In countries where electoral roll extracts are available to researchers, this method is likely to have a high yield for recruitment into community-based epidemiological studies.",M1
19597721,"Distribution and speciation of arsenic by transplacental and early life exposure to inorganic arsenic in offspring rats.The amount of arsenic compounds was determined in the liver and brain of pups and in breast milk in the pup's stomach in relation to the route of exposure: transplacental, breast milk, or <e>drinking</e> water. Forty-eight pregnant rats were randomly divided into four groups, each group was given free access to drinking water that contained 0, 10, 50, and 100 mg/L NaAsO(2) from gestation day 6 (GD 6) until postnatal day 42 (PND 42). Once pups were weaned, they started to drink the same arsenic-containing water as the dams. Contents of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and trimethylarsenic acid (TMA) in livers and brains of the pups on PND 0, 15, 28, and 42 and breast milk taken from the pup's stomach on PND 0 and 15 were detected using the hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy method. Concentrations of iAs, MMA, and DMA in the breast milk, the brain, and the liver of the pups increased with the concentration of arsenic in drinking water on PND 0, 15, 28, and 42. Compared to the liver or brain, breast milk had the lowest arsenic concentrations. There was a significant decrease in the levels of arsenic species on PND 15 compared to PND 0, 28, or 42. It was confirmed that arsenic species can pass through the placental barrier from dams to offspring and across the blood-brain barrier in the pups, and breast milk from dams exposed to arsenic in drinking water contains less arsenic than the liver and brain of pups.",M1
19578099,"Abnormal fluid homeostasis in apelin receptor knockout mice.The apelinergic system, comprised of apelin and its G protein-coupled receptor (APJ; APLNR as given in MGI Database), is expressed within key regions of the central nervous system associated with arginine vasopressin (AVP) synthesis and release as well as in structures involved in the control of <e>drinking</e> behaviour, including the magnocellular neurones of the hypothalamus, circumventricular organs, and the pituitary gland. This localisation is indicative of a possible functional role in fluid homeostasis. We investigated a role for APJ in the regulation of fluid balance using mice deficient for the receptor. Male APJ wild-type and knockout (APJ(-/-)) mice were housed in metabolic cages to allow determination of water intake and urine volume and osmolality. When provided with free access to water, APJ(-/-) mice drank significantly less than wild-types, while their urine volume and osmolality did not differ. Water deprivation for 24 h significantly reduced urine volume and increased osmolality in wild-type but not in APJ(-/-) mice. Baseline plasma AVP concentration increased comparably in both wild-type and APJ(-/-) mice following dehydration; however, APJ(-/-) mice were unable to concentrate their urine to the same extent as wild-type mice in response to the V2 agonist desmopressin. Analysis of c-fos (Fos as given in MGI Database) mRNA expression in response to dehydration showed attenuation of expression within the subfornical organ, accentuated expression in the paraventricular nucleus, but no differences in expression in the supraoptic nucleus nor median pre-optic nucleus in APJ(-/-) mice compared with wild-type. These findings demonstrate a physiological role for APJ in mechanisms of water intake and fluid retention and suggest an anti-diuretic effect of apelin in vivo.",M1

All animals were fed low-selenium diet, however half of them were supplemented with sodium selenite in drinking water (200microgSe/L) to ensure the normal dietary level of selenium. Glutathione peroxidase activity in erythrocytes and plasma as well as selenium concentration in plasma after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months in satellite groups showed considerable decrease in animals from non-selenium supplemented groups in comparison to supplemented groups. A clear arsenic concentration-dependent increase in the number of malignant lymphoma associated with increase in the risk of death was observed (hazard ratio=0.91, 1.46, and 2.24, for 50, 200 and 500microgAs/L, respectively). No significant influence of selenium dietary status on arsenic carcinogenicity was shown. A significant association between selenium supplementation status and increased risk of death of the animals from causes other than malignant tumors was found (HR=1.79, p=0.04).",M1
19552069,"Impact of chlorination on the incidence of cancers and miscarriages in two different campus communities in India.Long-term impacts of <e>drinking</e> chlorinated water on the incidence of cancers and miscarriages were assessed in a population-based cross-sectional study conducted in the two campus communities of IIT Kanpur (IITK) and IIT Kharagpur (IITKgp). IITK has been using untreated groundwater since the community was established in 1963, while IITKgp has been using chlorinated water for more than 30 years. A house-to-house survey was carried out to gather information on residential history, i.e age, education, income, source and extent of treatment of water and health characteristics. Only adults above 20 years of age were included for data analyses. Odds ratios were calculated based on the hypothesis that exposure to chlorinated drinking water may result in a higher incidence of cancers and miscarriages as found in many studies. The odds ratios (OR) in this study were found to be 0.56 (95% CI = 0.16 to 1.62) for cancers and 0.33 (95% CI = 0.19-0.56) for miscarriages. These OR values are not statistically significant indicating the lack of association between cancers or miscarriages and exposure to chlorinated drinking water, and are in agreement with some published epidemiological studies as well. Reciprocal OR values were calculated based on an alternative hypothesis that chlorination actually decreases the risk of cancers and miscarriages. Based on this, the OR values for cancers are 1.77 (95% CI = 0.55 to 5.66) and for miscarriages are 3.07 (95% CI = 1.78 to 5.29). These results show that there is no association between exposure to chlorinated drinking water and cancers while there is significant decrease in the incidence of miscarriages for those exposed to chlorinated drinking water.",M1
19545357,"Health beliefs about bottled water: a qualitative study.BACKGROUND: There has been a consistent rise in bottled water consumption over the last decade. Little is known about the health beliefs held by the general public about bottled water as this issue is not addressed by the existing quantitative literature. The purpose of this study was to improve understanding of the public's health beliefs concerning bottled mineral water, and the extent to which these beliefs and other views they hold, influence <e>drinking</e> habits. METHODS: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews, with 23 users of the Munrow Sports Centre on the University of Birmingham campus. RESULTS: Health beliefs about bottled water could be classified as general or specific beliefs. Most participants believed that bottled water conferred general health benefits but were unsure as to the nature of these. In terms of specific health beliefs, the idea that the minerals in bottled water conferred a health benefit was the most commonly cited. There were concerns over links between the plastic bottle itself and cancer. Participants believed that bottled water has a detrimental effect on the environment. Convenience, cost and taste were influential factors when making decisions as to whether to buy bottled water; health beliefs were unimportant motivating factors. CONCLUSION: The majority of participants believed that bottled water has some health benefits. However, these beliefs played a minor role in determining bottled water consumption and are unlikely to be helpful in explaining recent trends in bottled water consumption if generalised to the UK population. The health beliefs elicited were supported by scientific evidence to varying extents. Most participants did not feel that bottled water conferred significant, if any, health benefits over tap water.",M1
19536161,"The effect of acute fluid consumption on measures of impedance and percent body fat estimated using segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of acute fluid consumption on measures of impedance and percent body fat (%BF) estimated using segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis (SBIA). SUBJECTS/METHODS: Seventy-six healthy, recreationally active adults (41 women; 35 men) volunteered to participate in this study (mean+/-s.d.; age, 21.0+/-1.6 years; body mass index, 25.0+/-3.2 kg/m2). Subjects had their body composition assessed on three separate occasions. After a baseline measurement, subjects consumed 591 ml of water (H2O), a carbohydrate/electrolyte drink (CHOE) or received nothing (CON). Subjects were reassessed 20, 40 and 60 min following (POST) the baseline measure in each fluid condition. RESULTS: Twenty minutes after <e>drinking</e> a H2O or CHOE beverage, %BF (1.1 and 1.2%), impedance (12 and 14 Omega) and body mass increased significantly (P&lt;0.001). During the CON trial, %BF (0.3 and 0.5%) and impedance (7 and 11 Omega) also increased significantly above baseline values at 40 and 60 min POST. However, the normal hourly variability was significantly (P&lt;0.009) less than the observed fluid-induced %BF alterations. The greatest %BF increases were observed in the lightest subjects, who were women. Fluid type had no effect on the magnitude of change POST. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty minutes after drinking, %BF estimates increased approximately 1.0% due to elevations in impedance and body mass. As such, we recommend adhering to the pretest fluid restriction guideline to avoid fluid-induced alterations in SBIA body composition measures. In addition, use of a consistent testing schedule may minimize normal %BF variation over time.",M1
19508423,"Fluoride ingestion is related to fluid consumption patterns.OBJECTIVES: There have been few reports regarding variations of fluoride intake by fluid consumption patterns. The purpose of this study was to estimate fluoride intake among children in the United States based on their fluid consumption patterns. METHODS: Fluid intakes of children aged 1-10 years from plain water, beverages, and water from foods were assessed in a 24-hour recall diet survey as a part of the third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994). The amount of fluoride ingested from fluids in NHANES III was estimated from several assumptions about the concentration of fluoride in <e>drinking</e> water and beverages. Logistic regression analysis was conducted using SAS and SUDAAN. RESULTS: Children at the 75th percentile or higher of F intake from fluids (not including water used in cooking) ingested 0.05 mg F/kg/day or more, and children at the 90th percentile or higher ingested 0.07 mg F/kg/day or more. This finding held across all age groups. There was substantial variation in the estimated amount of fluoride ingestion depending on the children's fluid consumption patterns as well as age, gender, and race/ethnicity. African-American children ingested significantly more fluoride than White children in bivariate analysis. This association remained significant after accounting for fluid consumption pattern and other confounding factors in the model. CONCLUSION: Our results raise concerns that some children are ingesting significantly more fluoride than others depending on sociodemographic factors and fluid consumption patterns. Additional research is warranted to investigate the variation in the amounts of fluoride ingestion by these factors and its impact on fluorosis prevalence in different population groups.",M1

PLFA markers for bacteria were predominant in all of the biofilters and made up over half of the total PLFA content. PLFA diversity was compared and the biofilters fed with glucose had higher diversity. The Shannon-Wiener (or sometimes known as just Shannon diversity index) indices in the biofilters fed with acetate were from 0.68 to 0.97, while the indices in the biofilters fed with glucose were from 0.95 to 1.25. Principle components analysis showed that carbon sources and media depth were responsible for 68 and 17% of the total PLFA variance, respectively. The results indicated that PLFA analysis could be useful in illustrating microbial community structure in drinking water bioreactors, and microbial community structure was impacted by carbon substrates.",M1

All the sampled mice were treated for 90 days. There were 20 organic pollutants discovered in the water with total concentration of 9.41 microg/l. The NMR spectra for the sampled mice were different at delta2.06, delta2.24 and delta5.22. The concentrations of alanine, glycoprotein, acetone and trimethylamine-N-oxide in the source water group mice were decreased but that of creatinine and glucose were increased, which indicated that hepatotoxicity and kidney dysfunction occurred. There were six parameters for the source water group mice were different or extremely different from that of the control group. And these metabolites are responsible for separation of the data along PC1 and PC2 which may be used as biomarkers to indicate the source water pollution.

The mice were fed with the source water for 90-day and their body weights and relative organ weights were not significantly altered. The results of flow cytometry analysis showed that the relative percentage of the primary spermatocytes (4C) increased significantly, however, significant depletion was observed in the relative percentage of elongated spermatid (HC). These alterations in different germ cell populations were reflected in the various germ cell ratios. The ratio of 1C:4C showed declines while the ratio of 4C:2C increased and the percentage of abnormal sperm increased significantly. There were obvious testicular histopathology distinguishes observed in expansion of interstitial space and reduction in the number and size of Leydig cells. The data demonstrated that the source of drinking water from Yangtze River had actual toxicity on male mice reproductive system and suggested that the source water pollution should be controlled for protection of human health.",M1
19482261,"The effects of caffeine administration on the early stage of bone healing and bone density A histometric study in rats.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the daily administration of high doses of caffeine on the early stages of bone healing and on bone density in rats. METHODS: Twenty-four Wistar rats were assigned to one of the following groups: Non-caffeine group (n=12): animals without caffeine ingestion; Caffeine group (n=12): 10mg/100g body weight/day of caffeine via <e>drinking</e> water for 56 days. Forty-eight days after the beginning of caffeine intake, a critical-size surgical defect was created in the right tibia of both groups, while the contralateral tibia was left without defect. Eight days later, the animals were sacrificed and the specimens processed in order to obtain decalcified sections. The area of new bone formation in the right tibia and the bone density in the left tibia were histometrically evaluated in the medular bone. RESULTS: At 8 days post-operative, the caffeine group presented a significantly lower area of new bone formation, when compared to the non-caffeine group (p&lt;0.001). In addition, the administration of caffeine during 56 days did not alter the bone density. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that a high daily caffeine intake may disturb the early stages of bone healing, but does not alter bone density after a period of 56 days of administration.",M1
19477481,"Odour and flavour thresholds of gasoline additives (MTBE, ETBE and TAME) and their occurrence in Dutch <e>drinking</e> water collection areas.The use of ETBE (ethyl-tert-butylether) as gasoline additive has recently grown rapidly. Contamination of aquatic systems is well documented for MTBE (methyl-tert-butylether), but less for other gasoline additives. Due to their mobility they may easily reach drinking water collection areas. Odour and flavour thresholds of MTBE are known to be low, but for ETBE and TAME (methyl-tert-amylether) hardly information is available. The objective here is to determine these thresholds for MTBE, ETBE and TAME, and relate these to concentrations monitored in thousands of samples from Dutch drinking water collection areas. For ETBE odour and flavour thresholds are low with 1-2microgL(-1), for MTBE and TAME they range from 7 to 16microg L(-1). In most groundwater collection areas MTBE concentrations are below 0.1microg L(-1). In phreatic groundwaters in sandy soils not covered by a protective soil layer, occasionally MTBE occurs at higher concentrations. For surface water collection areas a minority of the locations is free of MTBE. For river bank and dune infiltrates, at a few locations the odour and flavour threshold is exceeded. For ETBE fewer monitoring data are available. ETBE was found in 2 out of 37 groundwater collection areas, in concentrations below 1microgL(-1). In the surface water collection areas monitored ETBE was found in concentrations near to the odour and flavour thresholds. The low odour and flavour thresholds combined with the high mobility and persistence of these compounds, their high production volumes and their increased use may yield problems with future production of drinking water.",M1
19476968,"Photodegradation of etridiazole by UV radiation during <e>drinking</e> water treatment.The photodegradation of etridiazole (ETZ) in water by UV radiation at 254 nm was investigated. Results indicate that the simulated first-order rate constants decreased with the increase of initial ETZ concentration (i.e., 5, 20 and 30 microM), and did not show any pH dependence within the range from 6.0 to 8.0. The quantum yield was 0.46+/-0.02 molE(-1) at pH 7.0. H(2)O(2) was generated at trace levels in the range from 0 to 1.0 microM during photodegradation of ETZ. Direct photodegradation was responsible for the decomposition of ETZ in distilled water by UV radiation. Three organic byproducts were identified: 5-ethoxy-3-dichloromethyl-1,2,4-thiadiazole, 5-ethoxy-1,2,4-thiadiazole-3-carboxylic acid and 5-ethoxy-3-hydroxyl-1,2,4-thiadiazole. About 90% of chloro mass in the initial ETZ was released as Cl(-) at the end of photodegradation. In contrast, the formation of sulfate and nitrate was insignificant. In general, ETZ decayed more quickly in groundwater than in sand-filtered or surface water. It is reasonably deduced that ETZ may not get removed effectively under a typical UV dose of 40 mJcm(-2) at most water treatment plants that employ UV radiation for disinfection.",M1
19472536,"Agreement between stress intraocular pressure  and long-term intraocular pressure measurements  in primary open angle glaucoma.PURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to study the correlation between the intraocular pressure peaks and fluctuation detected during the water <e>drinking</e> test and the same parameters observed during long-term follow up. METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled 22 eyes of 22 newly diagnosed primary open angle glaucoma patients. After an initial complete ophthalmological examination, patients were started on antiglaucoma medication and returned 4 weeks later to perform the water drinking test. Thereafter,patients were evaluated at least eight times within a period of 6-12 months. The intraocular pressure peaks and fluctuation detected during the water drinking stress test were compared with those observed during regular office visits. Spearman's correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman Plots were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 54.3 +/- 8.2 years (+/-SD), 59% were women, and average mean deviation -10.2 +/- 4.5 dB. The mean follow-up period was 8.2 +/- 2.0 months. The average intraocular pressure peaks and fluctuation during the water drinking test were 20.0 +/- 2.9 mmHg and 40 +/- 10%, respectively, and 18.1 +/- 2.8 mmHg and 30 +/- 10% during follow up. Spearman's correlation coefficients were significant and strong between the intraocular pressure peaks and fluctuation detected during the water drinking test and during the follow-up period (P &lt; 0.001, rho = 0.76 and 0.82,respectively). There was good agreement between the variables. CONCLUSION: The intraocular pressure peaks and fluctuation detected during the water drinking test showed significant correlation and agreement with the pressures observed during follow-up visits. Stress tests could be used to estimate long-term intraocular pressure variation.",M1
19455576,"Reduced water intake: Implications for rodent developmental and reproductive toxicity studies.In developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, <e>drinking</e> water is a common means of delivering the test agent. Reduced consumption of toxicant-containing water raises questions about indirect effects of reduced maternal fluid consumption resulting from unpalatability, versus direct effects of the test compound. Issues to consider include: objective assessment of dehydration and thirst, the relative contributions of innate and learned behaviors to drinking behavior and flavor preference, and the objective assessment of physiologic stress. Not only do lab animals under ad lib conditions consume more water than the minimum required to maintain fluid balance, animals faced with water restriction have substantial physiologic capacity for protection of metabolic processes. Measures of blood biochemistry can provide quantifiable, objective indications of fluid balance, but changes in these parameters could result from other causes such as effects of a test toxicant. Consummatory behaviors in response to perceived need are highly influenced by learning. Hence, the drinking behavior, water intake, and flavor acceptance/preference of animals used in toxicology experiments could be subject to learning experiences with the test compound. Physiological symptoms of stress produced by water deprivation may be distinguishable from the symptoms associated with other generalized stressors, such as food deprivation, but doing so may be beyond the scope of most developmental or reproductive toxicity studies. Use of concurrent controls, paired to test groups for water consumption, could help distinguish between the direct effects of a test toxicant as opposed to effects of reduced water consumption alone.",M1
19445987,"The effect of the consumption of water on the memory and attention of children.The impact of asking children to drink water during their school days, and its possible influence on school performance, has been little considered using intervention studies. Therefore in the afternoon the cognitive functioning of 40 children (mean of 8 years and 7 months) was assessed twice, once after <e>drinking</e> 300 ml of water and on another day when no water was provided. Memory was assessed by the recall of 15 previously presented objects. Recall was significantly better on the occasions when water had been consumed. The ability to sustain attention was measured by asking the child to respond to a light that followed an auditory warning after a delay of either 3 or 12 s. The ability to sustain attention was not significantly influenced by whether water had been drunk.",M1
19442833,"Exposure to methamidophos at adulthood elicits depressive-like behavior in mice.Epidemiologic studies have suggested that organophosphate exposure is associated with an increased risk of depression and suicide. Considering that the neurobiological basis of this association is not well understood, in the present study we evaluated the depressive-like behavior of Swiss mice subchronically exposed to the organophosphate methamidophos at adulthood. From postnatal days 60 to 89 (PN60-PN89), one of two concentrations of methamidophos [higher dose (HiD): 5.25 microg/ml; lower dose (LoD): 1.31 microg/ml] or vehicle was administered in the <e>drinking</e> water. Immobile behavior, an animal model of depressive behavior, was assessed in the forced swimming and tail suspension tests either during (PN88) or after (PN99) the exposure period. On the subsequent day (PN89 or PN100), the Rota-rod and endurance swimming tests were used to evaluate motor performance. Brain acetylcholinesterase activity was quantified. During exposure, the LoD group presented increased immobility in the tail suspension test when compared to controls. The HiD group presented increased immobility in the forced swimming test when compared to LoD and control groups, an effect that emerged after cessation of exposure. There were no motor performance alterations. During exposure, acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited in the HiD (43%) and LoD (15%) groups. After exposure, enzyme activity was reduced (25%) only in the HiD group. There were no signs of systemic toxicity. There were no correlations between acetylcholinesterase activity and behavioral measures. Our results indicate that methamidophos at doses below the threshold for systemic toxicity induces depressive-like behavior in adult mice.",M1
19434800,"Effect of coffee and tea on the glycaemic index of foods: no effect on mean but   reduced variability.Coffee and tea may influence glycaemic responses but it is not clear whether they affect the glycaemic index (GI) value of foods. Therefore, to see if coffee and tea affected the mean and SEM of GI values, the GI of fruit leather (FL) and cheese puffs (CP) were determined twice in ten subjects using the FAO/WHO protocol with white bread as the reference food. In one series subjects chose to drink 250 ml of either coffee or tea with all test meals, while in the other series they drank 250 ml water. The tests for both series were conducted as a single experiment with the order of all tests being randomised. Coffee and tea increased the overall mean peak blood glucose increment compared with water by 0.25 (SEM 0.09) mmol/l (P=0.02), but did not significantly affect the incremental area under the glucose response curve. Mean GI values were not affected by coffee or tea but the SEM was reduced by about 30% (FL: 31 (SEM 4) v. 35 (SEM 7) and CP: 76 (SEM 6) v. 75 (SEM 8) for coffee or tea v. water, respectively). The error mean square term from the ANOVA of the GI values was significantly smaller for coffee or tea v. water (F(18, 18) = 2.31; P=0.04). We conclude that <e>drinking</e> coffee or tea with test meals does not affect the mean GI value obtained, but may reduce variability and, hence, improve precision.",M1

19434218,"Mechanism of the delayed puberty onset in offspring of rats that consumed aqueous extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa during pregnancy.Consumption of extracts of Hibiscus sabdariffa (family: malvaceae) during pregnancy has been shown to cause maternal malnutrition which has been linked to various adverse conditions like increased postnatal weight gain, delayed puberty onset and elevated body weight and body mass index at onset of puberty in the female offspring. The present study was designed to investigate the possible mechanism underlying this. Eighteen in-bred pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were on day 1 of pregnancy, randomly divided into three groups of six animals each. Group A (control) was given tap water to drink. Group B was given 0.6g extract/100ml while Group C was given 1.8g extract/100ml as their <e>drinking</e> solution. All groups received normal rat chow and their drinking solution ad libitum. Fluid and food intake and dam weights were measured daily throughout pregnancy. On gestational day 18, blood sample was withdrawn from each rat for estimation of plasma Na ion and corticosterone levels. On the day of delivery, the solutions of the extracts of Hibiscus sabdariffa were withdrawn and replaced with tap water. After 21 days, the pups were weaned to tap water and food ad libitum. Pups weight and age and body mass index at onset of puberty were measured. The results of the present study showed that the increased postnatal weight gain, delayed puberty onset and elevated body mass index at onset of puberty in the offspring of rats that consumed HS during pregnancy was associated with elevated maternal plasma Na ion and corticosterone levels during pregnancy.",M1
20572471,"Stress and alcohol use among soldiers assessed at mobilization and demobilization.Excessive alcohol use may have negative consequences, including less force readiness among military personnel. The identification of variables associated with alcohol use may inform early intervention efforts to decrease negative consequences. This longitudinal prospective study examined the associations of demographic and stress variables with alcohol use among 876 soldiers that were mobilized and demobilized through an Army installation during a 9-month period in 2003. Participants reported a moderate level of general stress at mobilization and demobilization, and a minority reported significant combat stress. Alcohol use in the 2 weeks before the demobilization evaluation was associated with younger age, nonactive duty status before mobilization, and more general stress. Male gender was associated with more drinks per <e>drinking</e> day. The results suggest that younger, nonactive duty male personnel experiencing stress may be a group at risk for increased drinking after deployment and for whom intervention may be helpful.",M2
20564404,"Smoking, alcohol use, obesity, and overall survival from non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a population-based study.BACKGROUND: Smoking, alcohol use, and obesity appear to increase the risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but to the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have assessed their impact on NHL prognosis. METHODS: The association between prediagnosis cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and body mass index (BMI) and overall survival was evaluated in 1286 patients enrolled through population-based registries in the United States from 1998 through 2000. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for clinical and demographic factors. RESULTS: Through 2007, 442 patients had died (34%), and the median follow-up for surviving patients was 7.7 years. Compared with never smokers, former (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.12-2.26) and current (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.97-2.29) smokers had poorer survival, and poorer survival was found to be positively associated with smoking duration, number of cigarettes smoked per day, pack-years of smoking, and shorter time since quitting (all P &lt;0.01). Alcohol use was associated with poorer survival (P = 0.03); compared with nonusers. Those <e>drinking</e> &gt;43.1 g/week (median intake among drinkers) had poorer survival (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.06-2.27), whereas those drinkers consuming less than this amount demonstrated no survival disadvantage (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.75-1.71). Greater BMI was associated with poorer survival (P = 0.046), but the survival disadvantage was only noted among obese individuals (HR, 1.32 for BMI &gt; or = 30 vs BMI 20-24.9; 95% CI, 1.02-1.70). These results held for lymphoma-specific survival and were broadly similar for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: NHL patients who smoked, consumed alcohol, or were obese before diagnosis were found to have a poorer overall and lymphoma-specific survival.",M2

20544564,"A roadside survey of alcohol and drug use among drivers in British Columbia.OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to determine the prevalence of alcohol and drug use among a random sample of nighttime drivers. METHODS: Drivers were randomly selected from the traffic stream in three cities in British Columbia and asked to provide a breath sample to determine alcohol content and a sample of oral fluid to be tested for the presence of psychoactive drugs. The survey was conducted between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 03:00 a.m. on Wednesday through Saturday nights in June 2008. RESULTS: Of the 1533 vehicles selected, 89 percent of drivers provided a breath sample and 78 percent provided a sample of oral fluid. Key findings include: 10.4 percent of drivers tested positive for drug use. 8.1 percent of drivers had been <e>drinking</e>. 15.5 percent of drivers tested positive for alcohol, drugs, or both. Cannabis and cocaine were the drugs most frequently detected in drivers. Alcohol use among drivers was most common on weekends and during late-night hours; drug use was more evenly distributed across all survey nights and times. Alcohol use was most common among drivers aged 19 to 24 and 25 to 34; drug use was more evenly distributed across all age groups. Though driving after drinking has decreased substantially since previous surveys, the number of drivers with elevated alcohol levels (over 80 mg/dL) was higher than in the past. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that drug use is more common than alcohol use among drivers highlights the need for a unique and separate societal response to the use of drugs by drivers commensurate with the extent of safety risks posed to road users. The observed differences between driving after drug use and driving after drinking have implications for enforcement and prevention.",M2
20538109,"Comparison of outcomes among moderate alcohol drinkers before acute myocardial infarction to effect of continued versus discontinuing alcohol intake after the infarct.Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption has been previously associated with a lower risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and mortality. The association of changes in <e>drinking</e> behavior after an AMI with health status and long-term outcomes is unknown. Using a prospective cohort of patients with AMI evaluated with the World Health Organization's Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, we investigated changes in drinking patterns in 325 patients who reported moderate drinking at the time of their AMI. One-year alcohol consumption, disease-specific (angina pectoris and quality of life) and general (mental and physical) health status and rehospitalization outcomes, and 3-year mortality were assessed. Seattle Angina Questionnaire Angina Frequency and Quality of Life, Short Form-12 Mental and Physical Component Summary Scales were modeled using multivariable hierarchical linear models within site. Of the initial 325 moderate drinkers at baseline, 273 (84%) remained drinking and 52 (16%) quit. In fully adjusted models, Physical Component Scale scores (beta 6.47, 95% confidence interval 3.73 to 9.21, p &lt;0.01) were significantly higher during follow-up in those who remained drinking. Persistent moderate drinkers had a trend toward less angina (relative risk 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 1.10, p = 0.11), fewer rehospitalizations (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.41, p = 0.42), lower 3-year mortality (relative risk 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 2.51, p = 0.64), and better disease-specific quality of life (Seattle Angina Questionnaire Quality of Life, beta 3.88, 95% confidence interval -0.79 to 8.55, p = 0.10) and mental health (Mental Component Scale, beta 0.83, 95% confidence interval -1.62 to 3.27, p = 0.51) than quitters. In conclusion, these data suggest that there are no adverse effects for moderate drinkers to continue consuming alcohol and that they may have better physical functioning compared to those who quit drinking after an AMI.",M2

Using data from the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium, the authors conducted a formal analysis of BMI as a modifier of smoking- and alcohol-related effects. Analysis of never and current smokers included 6,333 cases, while analysis of never drinkers and consumers of &lt; or =10 drinks/day included 8,452 cases. There were 8,000 or more controls, depending on the analysis. Odds ratios for all sites increased with lower BMI, greater smoking, and greater <e>drinking</e>. In polytomous regression, odds ratios for BMI (P = 0.65), smoking (P = 0.52), and drinking (P = 0.73) were homogeneous for oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers. Odds ratios for BMI and drinking were greater for oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer (P &lt; 0.01), while smoking odds ratios were greater for laryngeal cancer (P &lt; 0.01). Lower BMI enhanced smoking- and drinking-related odds ratios for oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer (P &lt; 0.01), while BMI did not modify smoking and drinking odds ratios for laryngeal cancer. The increased odds ratios for all sites with low BMI may suggest related carcinogenic mechanisms; however, BMI modification of smoking and drinking odds ratios for cancer of the oral cavity/pharynx but not larynx cancer suggests additional factors specific to oral cavity/pharynx cancer.",M2

Results from some previous studies, but not all, suggest that this association is modified by variations in genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). We aimed to test this hypothesis, including alcohol as both the amount of alcohol and the frequency of drinking. METHODS: we conducted a nested case-cohort study within the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health study, including 1,645 men (770 incident cases of acute coronary syndrome from 1993-1997 through 2004 and 875 randomly selected controls). RESULTS: Higher alcohol intake (measured as amount or drinking frequency) was associated with lower risk of acute coronary syndrome; however, there was no evidence that these finding were modified by ADH1B or ADH1C genotypes.

METHODS: For a meta-analysis, we identified cohort studies of alcohol and endometrial cancer by a literature search of Pub-Med and Embase up to 1 March 2010 and by searching the reference lists of relevant articles. RESULTS: Seven cohort studies, including 1,511,661 participants and 6086 endometrial cancer cases, were included in the dose-response random-effect meta-regression model. Compared with non-drinkers, women <e>drinking</e> less than 1 drink of alcohol (13 g of ethanol) per day had a lower risk for endometrial cancer; this risk was lower by 4% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.93-1.00) for consumption up to 0.5 drink per day and by 7% (95% CI: 0.85-1.02) for consumption up to 1 drink. However, we found evidence of an increased risk for endometrial cancer for intakes higher than two alcoholic drinks per day: compared with non-drinkers, the risk was higher by 14% (95% CI: 0.95-1.36) for 2-2.5 drinks per day and by 25% (95% CI: 0.98-1.58) for &gt;2.5 drinks per day.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of 2004-2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. SETTING: United States. SUBJECTS:. A representative sample of noninstitutionalized employed and insured adults aged 18 to 64 years (139,738 in 2004 and 159,755 in 2005). MEASURES: Self-reported clinical preventive services utilization and lifestyle-related behaviors, as well as multiple logistic regression analyses assessing the independent effects of demographic and access variables on health behaviors. RESULTS: Among insured workers, rates of not using recommended clinical preventive services ranged from 8.5% (cervical cancer screening) to 73.9% (influenza vaccination). Rates for engaging in lifestyle-related risks ranged from 5.5% (heavy <e>drinking</e>) to 77.1% (inadequate fruit-vegetable consumption).

20437850,"Alcohol, tobacco and genetic susceptibility in relation to cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract in northern Italy.AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Each year in Italy there are approximately 14,000 new cases and 7,000 deaths from cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract, which includes malignant tumors originating from the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and esophagus. Established etiological factors include tobacco consumption and heavy alcohol <e>drinking</e>. The study of single nucleotide polymorphisms in upper aerodigestive tract cancer etiology may help to identify high-risk subgroups and to better understand the pathways leading to the development of these cancers. METHODS: Italian results on about 500 cases and 500 controls from a large case-control study (ARCAGE) conducted in 10 European countries are presented with the major objectives of updating results on the effects of alcohol and tobacco consumptions in northern Italy, investigating the role of genetic variation with regard to the metabolism of alcohol and carcinogens from tobacco smoke, and evaluating possible interactions of these single nucleotide polymorphisms with these carcinogens. RESULTS: The present study confirmed the importance of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking as the main risk factors for upper aerodigestive tract cancers, indicating that about 68% of cancers among populations in northern Italy can be attributed to the combination of these risk factors. Significant associations between metabolizing phase I genes (CYP1A1 and CYP2A6), phase II genes (GSTA2) and upper aerodigestive tract cancers were found. A polymorphism of ADH1C has been associated with an increased risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers, suggesting that the less rapid alcohol metabolizers are more susceptible to upper aerodigestive tract cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the ADH1C allele modifies the carcinogenic dose response for alcohol in the upper aerodigestive tract, giving rise to a gene-environment interaction. The role of genes as possible modifiers of life-style risks seems the most reliable.",M2

A total of 4,691 students, primarily fourth and fifth graders, completed the survey. The students provided responses to questions on topics such as drug use, alcohol use, TV and video game viewing time, and their home life. We analyzed the survey using Chi-square tests and logistic regression. RESULTS: Approximately one-third of respondents indicated substance use, which was defined as alcohol use, illegal drug use, smoking/tobacco use, or sniffing solvents. Significantly more children (28% of those watching &gt; or = 3 hours of TV/video games compared with 20% of those watching greater than zero but &lt; or = 2 hours of TV/video games) reported alcohol use (p&lt;0.05).

20431813,"Predictors of relapse to significant alcohol <e>drinking</e> after liver transplantation.BACKGROUND: End-stage alcoholic liver disease is common, with many of these patients referred for liver transplantation (LT). Alcohol relapse after LT can have detrimental outcomes such as graft loss and can contribute to a negative public perception of LT. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that predict the recurrence of harmful alcohol consumption after LT. METHODS: A total of 80 patients who underwent LT for alcoholic cirrhosis or had significant alcohol consumption in association with another primary liver disease, from July 1992 to June 2006 in British Columbia, were retrospectively evaluated by chart review. Several demographic-, psychosocial- and addiction-related variables were studied. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to test possible associations among the variables studied and a return to harmful drinking after LT. RESULTS: The relapse rate of harmful alcohol consumption post-liver transplant was 10%, with two patient deaths occurring directly as a result of alcohol relapse. Univariate analysis revealed relapse was significantly associated with pretransplant abstinence of less than six months (P=0.003), presence of psychiatric comorbidities (P=0.016), female sex (P=0.019) and increased personal stressors (P=0.044), while age at transplant of younger than 50 years approached significance (P=0.054). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the following independent factors for relapse: pretransplant abstinence of less than six months (OR 77.07; standard error 1.743; P=0.013) and female sex (OR 18.80; standard error 1.451; P=0.043). CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study strongly support a required minimum of six months of abstinence before LT because duration of abstinence was found to be the strongest predictor of recidivism.

METHODS: At a large transport company, employees presenting to the occupational health services for a routine health and lifestyle check-up were offered to undertake an alcohol screening by means of self-report (the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-AUDIT) and a biomarker (carbohydrate-deficient transferrin in serum-CDT). Those screening positive for the AUDIT and/or CDT were randomized to a brief or comprehensive intervention group or to a control group. An identical follow-up session was performed 12 months later. RESULTS: Of 990 employees (68% men) that volunteered for the alcohol screening, 194 (20%) tested positive for the AUDIT and/or CDT. Among the 158 (81%) subjects who also attended the follow-up session, the frequency of positive screening results at baseline/follow-up were 51%/23% for the AUDIT (P &lt; 0.0001) and 58%/34% (P &lt; 0.0001) for CDT. However, there were no significant differences between the brief and comprehensive intervention groups or between the intervention groups and the control group. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that alcohol screening and brief intervention performed in connection with routine health and lifestyle examinations in the workplace may be effective in reducing alcohol consumption. Given the lack of difference in outcome between the intervention groups and the control group, alcohol screening may in itself cause reduction in drinking. In addition, at least some of the positive effect may be explained by regression towards the mean.",M2
20403941,"Breastfeeding and prolactin levels in lactating women with a family history of alcoholism.OBJECTIVE: Many motivated new mothers fail to reach public health goals for breastfeeding, highlighting the need to identify risk factors. Because having a family history of alcoholism is associated with blunted prolactin responses to an alcohol challenge in nonlactating individuals, this study aimed to identify associations in family history of alcoholism, prolactin, and breastfeeding behaviors in lactating women. METHODS: This was a 2-day experimental study that used within-subject alcohol or control beverage consumption and between-subject family history of alcoholism factors. The participants were non-alcohol-dependent lactating women; 7 were family history-positive (FHP) for alcohol dependence, and 21 were family history-negative (FHN). Consumption of 0.4 g/kg alcohol or nonalcoholic beverage occurred in separate randomized sessions, followed by use of a breast pump. Basal and suckling-induced prolactin, blood alcohol concentrations, milk yield, self-reported drug effects, neophobia, and breastfeeding patterning were measured. RESULTS: Although no group differences in alcohol pharmacokinetics were detected, FHP women exhibited blunted prolactin to breast stimulation after <e>drinking</e> the control and alcohol beverage and felt more of the stimulant-like effects of alcohol than did FHN women. FHP women reported more frequent daily breastfeeding than did FHN women. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence that family history of alcoholism is associated with a blunted magnitude, rapidity, and duration of the prolactin response to breast stimulation and an alcohol challenge in lactating women. More frequent breastfeeding by FHP women suggests behavioral compensation for perceived and/or actual poor lactation. Alcohol did not enhance lactational performance, further disputing the lore that alcohol is a galactagogue.",M2
20402613,"Alcohol policy reform in Australia: what can we learn from the evidence?Alcohol consumption is a major risk factor contributing to the burden of disease in Australia. The National Preventative Health Taskforce recommends the long-term goal of reshaping Australia's <e>drinking</e> culture to produce healthier and safer outcomes. A study of the cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce alcohol-related harm in Australia suggests that policymakers could achieve over 10 times the health gain if they reallocated the current level of investment. The optimal package of interventions identified in the study comprises, in order of cost-effectiveness, volumetric taxation, advertising bans, an increase in the minimum legal drinking age to 21 years, brief intervention by primary care practitioners, licensing controls, a drink-driving mass media campaign, and random breath testing. Australia has a window of opportunity to significantly expand activities to reduce alcohol-related harm. It is important that federal and state governments take this opportunity to reform alcohol policy in Australia.",M2
20402612,"How can we reduce alcohol-related road crash deaths among young Australians?In the United States, policy experiments over a 20-year period have demonstrated that road crash deaths among young adults can be substantially reduced by raising the minimum legal <e>drinking</e> age to 21 years. A recent evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of policies for reducing alcohol-related harm in Australia found that, if the US experience were to be replicated in Australia, raising the minimum legal drinking age would be more cost-effective than random breath testing and drink-driving campaigns. Given the major political obstacles to increasing the minimum legal drinking age, we propose another policy that could achieve a similar reduction in road crash deaths - requiring licensed drivers to maintain a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of zero until at least the age of 21 years (close to the current policy of zero BAC until age 22 years in Victoria), and preferably until 25 years. This would allow young Australians to drink or drive but not to combine these activities for at least the first several years of driving. If all Australian jurisdictions had adopted this policy in 2003, 17 deaths could have been be averted among young Australians as they aged from 18 to 21 years and many more serious injuries could have been prevented each year. If we had enforced a zero BAC until age 25, the number of deaths averted until age 25 years could have been as high as 50.",M2
20402294,"Knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of young people related to <e>drinking</e> and driving in Mostar region, Bosnia and Herzegovina.The traffic accidents became the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young population groups during the late 60s and early 70s. Among several European countries that are in transition, Bosnia and Herzegovina takes the leading place in fatal traffic accidents. In this study we have investigated knowledge, attitudes and behavior of young people related to alcohol impaired driving. Our aim was to investigate the patterns and behavior among young people that could be useful for public health intervention among them. This is of special interest as there is a lack of such information from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The study was performed in the city of Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The study included 189 examinees of both genders, aged between 18 and 24 years, who have been divided in two groups: students of the University of Mostar and those who did not go for further education after high school (nonstudents). Sampling was performed in July 2006 in Mostar and surrounding area. The Gallup organization questionnaire was used. Descriptive statistic test and chi-square were used in statistical analysis. Result of this study could be helpful in taking preventive measures for lowering number of traffic accidents among young people or they could be base in some protective programs for increasing traffic safety.",M2
20395573,"Will increasing alcohol availability by lowering the minimum legal <e>drinking</e> age decrease drinking and related consequences among youths?Alcohol use health consequences are considerable; prevention efforts are needed, particularly for adolescents and college students. The national minimum legal drinking age of 21 years is a primary alcohol-control policy in the United States. An advocacy group supported by some college presidents seeks public debate on the minimum legal drinking age and proposes reducing it to 18 years. We reviewed recent trends in drinking and related consequences, evidence on effectiveness of the minimum legal drinking age of 21 years, research on drinking among college students related to the minimum legal drinking age, and the case to lower the minimum legal drinking age. Evidence supporting the minimum legal drinking age of 21 years is strong and growing. A wide range of empirically supported interventions is available to reduce underage drinking. Public health professionals can play a role in advocating these interventions.",M2
20391297,"Moderate red wine consumption and cardiovascular disease risk: beyond the  French paradox .The term FRENCH PARADOX was coined in 1992 to describe the relatively low incidence of cardiovascular disease in the French population, despite a relatively high dietary intake of saturated fats, and potentially attributable to the consumption of red wine. After nearly 20 years, several studies have investigated the fascinating, overwhelmingly positive biological and clinical associations of red wine consumption with cardiovascular disease and mortality. Light to moderate intake of red wine produces a kaleidoscope of potentially beneficial effects that target all phases of the atherosclerotic process, from atherogenesis (early plaque development and growth) to vessel occlusion (flow-mediated dilatation, thrombosis). Such beneficial effects involve cellular signaling mechanisms, interactions at the genomic level, and biochemical modifications of cellular and plasma components. Red wine components, especially alcohol, resveratrol, and other polyphenolic compounds, may decrease oxidative stress, enhance cholesterol efflux from vessel walls (mainly by increasing levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and inhibit lipoproteins oxidation, macrophage cholesterol accumulation, and foam-cell formation. These components may also increase nitric oxide bioavailability, thereby antagonizing the development of endothelial dysfunction, decrease blood viscosity, improve insulin sensitivity, counteract platelet hyperactivity, inhibit platelet adhesion to fibrinogen-coated surfaces, and decrease plasma levels of von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, and coagulation factor VII. Light to moderate red wine consumption is also associated with a favorable genetic modulation of fibrinolytic proteins, ultimately increasing the surface-localized endothelial cell fibrinolysis. Overall, therefore, the  French paradox  may have its basis within a milieu containing several key molecules, so that favorable cardiovascular benefits might be primarily attributable to combined, additive, or perhaps synergistic effects of alcohol and other wine components on atherogenesis, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Conversely, chronic heavy alcohol consumption and binge <e>drinking</e> are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. In conclusion, although mounting evidence strongly supports beneficial cardiovascular effects of moderate red wine consumption (one to two drinks per day; 10-30 g alcohol) in most populations, clinical advice to abstainers to initiate daily alcohol consumption has not yet been substantiated in the literature and must be considered with caution on an individual basis.",M2

20390657,"The evolution of <e>drinking</e> motivations among Korean women with alcohol dependence.Our purpose in conducting this study was to explore increases in alcohol problems among women in South Korea. Qualitative data were collected from 10 women in treatment for alcohol dependence using in-depth interviews. The grounded theory analysis revealed three phases of drinking behavior that were driven by certain motivations: (1) positive experiences, (2) coping with negative emotions, and (3) needing alcohol to function. The findings suggest that the increased occurrence of alcohol dependence among Korean women may be associated with shifting expectations about women's alcohol use and conflicts between their traditional and modern gender roles in the rapidly changing society.",M2
20387542,"[Tools for brief intervention--the national norms charts of alcohol consumption (for adult men and women)--, report No1]We made out two ranking tables of alcohol consumption norms for Japanese adult men and women based on National Health and Nutrition Survey Japan. 2005. and Nationalwide Survey of Alcohol <e>Drinking</e> and Alcoholism among Japanese adults. From the tables, we drew Ranking Lists, which rank subjects out of 100 Japanese men or women in the frequency and quantity of drinking, and visually indicate heavier drinkers as higher and less degree. In the UK or US, such tables and charts already have been made out from their norms, and carried on the websites and used in the PROJECT MATCH by NIAAA. So we attempt- ed to make them out from Japanese norms, and intend to use these charts for brief intervention at medical examinations in the workplace and at medical institutions, in order to motivate heavy drinkers to receive treatment and modify their drinking behavior according to self-regulation model by Agostinelli, G. et al., as well as to encourage them to recognize their danger of overdrinking objectively.",M2
20387541,"[Relationship between <e>drinking</e>, smoking, and dietary habits and the body mass index of Japanese alcoholic men]Malnutrition and emaciation in alcoholics is associated with various alcoholism-related diseases, including Wernicke's encephalopathy, aero-digestive tract cancer, and serious metabolic disorders. We used a self-administered questionnaire survey for structured dietary habit screening to evaluate the dietary profiles of 467 Japanese alcoholic men aged 40 years or over and their relationship to body mass index (BMI). Their average daily ethanol consumption was 119 +/- 65 g (845 +/- 463 kcal). The survey showed that 50.5% of the subjects consumed three meals a day; 32.8%, two meals; 12.2%, one meal; and 4.5% rarely ate. The meals mainly consisted of carbohydrates and protein, with few vegetables. Daily alcohol consumption was inversely correlated with the frequency of meals, drinking milk, and consuming confectionery. The subjects who lived with their family (72.8%) consumed more meals than the subjects liv- ing alone. After excluding 22 subjects with leg edema or ascites, the average BMI was 21.3 +/- 3.2. The group with the lowest BMI values (&lt;18.5) accounted for 19.3% of the subjects, and those with the highest BMI values (&gt; or = 25) accounted for 11.5%. A multivariate stepwise logistic analysis showed that BMI increased 0.15 per 22 g ethanol consumed daily and decreased 0.03 per + 10 cigarettes smoked daily, 0.43 per decrease by one in daily frequency of meals, and 0.54 per category (daily, occasionally, rarely, seldom) of milk consumption. The likelihood of a low BMI &lt;18.5 was significantly and independently associated with smoking [OR (95%CI) =1.24 (1.02-1.51) per +10 cigarettes] and with intake of seafood [0.62 (0.41-0.94) per +1 category], milk [1.52 (1.16-2.00) per +1 category] and green and yellow vegetables [1.52 (1.05-2.21) per +1 category].

Results of recent neuroscience research have substantiated the deleterious effects of alcohol on adolescent brain development and added even more evidence to support the call to prevent and reduce underaged <e>drinking</e>. Pediatricians should be knowledgeable about substance abuse to be able to recognize risk factors for alcohol and other substance abuse among youth, screen for use, provide appropriate brief interventions, and refer to treatment. The integration of alcohol use prevention programs in the community and our educational system from elementary school through college should be promoted by pediatricians and the health care community.

Additional research into the prevention, screening and identification, brief intervention, and management and treatment of alcohol and other substance use by adolescents continues to be needed to improve evidence-based practices.",M2
20385629,"Prospective study of adolescent alcohol consumption and risk of benign breast disease in young women.OBJECTIVE: To investigate prospectively, using alcoholic beverage consumption data collected in real time, the association between adolescent <e>drinking</e> and risk of biopsy-confirmed benign breast disease (BBD) in young women. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: The Growing Up Today Study is a prospective cohort study of US girls, aged 9 to 15 years at baseline, with annual questionnaires from 1996 through 2001, followed by questionnaires in 2003, 2005, and 2007. On the 2003 survey, the participants (then aged 16-23 years) provided information about their alcoholic beverage consumption in the previous year. On the 2005 and 2007 surveys, a total of 6899 women (aged 18-27 years) reported whether a health care provider had ever diagnosed them with BBD (n = 147 cases) and whether it was confirmed by biopsy (n = 67 cases); 6752 women reported never being diagnosed with BBD. RESULTS: Adjusted for age and BMI, quantity of alcohol consumed was associated with increased risk of biopsy-confirmed BBD (odds ratio: 1.50 per drink per day [95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.90]). Girls who typically drank 6 or 7 days/week were at higher risk (odds ratio: 5.50 [95% confidence interval: 1.23-24.53]) compared with those who never drank or who drank less than once per week. CONCLUSIONS: Higher amounts consumed, and more frequent consumption, of alcoholic beverages in adolescence may increase the occurrence of BBD in young women. Advising teenagers to avoid alcoholic beverages, along with smoking and sun exposure, may reduce cancer incidence in adulthood.",M2
20384427,"Relations between heavy <e>drinking</e>, gender, and substance-free reinforcement.Behavioral economic theory and laboratory research have suggested that substance abuse may be associated with diminished engagement in enjoyable substance-free activities (substance-free reinforcement). However, college students, in particular men, have reported numerous social benefits from drinking that might mitigate the expected inverse relation between drinking and substance-free reinforcement. In this study, we examined the relations between college student heavy drinking, gender, and several categories of substance-free reinforcement (peer, dating, sexual, school, and family activities). Participants were 246 undergraduate students who were classified as a function of their reported frequency of heavy drinking during a typical week in the past month (120 heavy drinkers, 126 light drinkers). Heavy drinking was associated with significantly higher substance-free peer and sexual reinforcement. This association was gender invariant and remained significant in multiple regression models that controlled for gender, ethnicity, and fraternity or sorority membership. Substance-free reinforcement did not predict frequency of heavy drinking in models that included levels of substance-related reinforcement. The results indicate that college student heavy drinking is not associated with global deficits in substance-free reinforcement and is instead associated with increased peer and sexual activity that occurs outside the context of drinking or drug use. Prevention programs should help students to compensate for the potential loss of social reinforcement associated with reductions in drinking.",M2
20373230,"Abstinence monitoring of suspected <e>drinking</e> drivers: ethyl glucuronide in hair versus CDT.OBJECTIVE: Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) determinations in the hair of self-reported teetotalers were reviewed and compared with carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) blood tests (by immunochemistry and high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]). METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out on 154 people whose fitness to drive had to be assessed because of the suspicion of relevant alcohol problems. RESULTS: EtG was detected in 55 percent of the hair samples and abstinence thus disproved. In two thirds (67%) of these cases, alcohol consumption was even shown to be excessive (EtG values &gt; 30 pg/mg). Of the EtG-positive subjects 54 and 82 percent had CDT values within the reference range by immunochemistry and HPLC, respectively. Thirty-nine percent of the EtG-negative subjects had increased immunochemical CDT values; in contrast, 96 percent had HPLC CDT values within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: EtG analysis in hair is a useful tool for assessing fitness to drive in suspected drinking drivers; compared to CDT values it provides a direct and unequivocal marker for reliable abstinence monitoring over a period of several months, depending on the length of the hair.",M2
20373229,"Self-reported collision risk associated with cannabis use and driving after cannabis use among Ontario adults.OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of cannabis use and driving after cannabis use on self-reported collision involvement within the previous 12 months while controlling for demographics, driving exposure, binge <e>drinking</e>, and driving after drinking based on a large representative sample of adults in Ontario. METHODS: Data are based on the CAMH Monitor, an ongoing cross-sectional telephone survey of Ontario adults aged 18 and older, conducted by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Data on drivers who reported driving at least one kilometer per week and who responded to the collision item from 2002 to 2007 were merged into one data set (n = 8481). Logistic regression analysis of self-reported collision risk posed by cannabis use (lifetime and past 12 months), driving after cannabis use (past 12 months), and driving after drinking among drinkers (past 12 months) was implemented, controlling for the effects of gender, age, region, income, education, marital status, kilometers driven in a typical week, and consuming five or more drinks of alcohol on one occasion (past 12 months). Due to list-wise deletion of cases the logistic regression sample was reduced (n = 6907). RESULTS: Several demographic factors were found to be significantly associated with self-reported collision involvement. The logistic regression model revealed that age, region, income, marital status, and number of kilometers driven in a typical week, were all significantly related to collision involvement, after adjusting for other factors. Respondents who reported having driven after cannabis use within the past 12 months had increased risk of collision involvement (odds ratio [OR] = 1.84) compared to those who never drove after using cannabis, a greater risk than that associated with having reported driving after drinking within the past 12 months (OR = 1.34). CONCLUSION: Further investigation of the impact of driving after cannabis use on collision risk and factors that may modify that relationship is warranted.",M2
20371762,"Fruit and vegetable intake and overall cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).BACKGROUND: It is widely believed that cancer can be prevented by high intake of fruits and vegetables. However, inconsistent results from many studies have not been able to conclusively establish an inverse association between fruit and vegetable intake and overall cancer risk. METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort to assess relationships between intake of total fruits, total vegetables, and total fruits and vegetables combined and cancer risk during 1992-2000. Detailed information on the dietary habit and lifestyle variables of the cohort was obtained. Cancer incidence and mortality data were ascertained, and hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable Cox regression models. Analyses were also conducted for cancers associated with tobacco and alcohol after stratification for tobacco smoking and alcohol <e>drinking</e>. RESULTS: Of the initial 142 605 men and 335 873 women included in the study, 9604 men and 21 000 women were identified with cancer after a median follow-up of 8.7 years. The crude cancer incidence rates were 7.9 per 1000 person-years in men and 7.1 per 1000 person-years in women. Associations between reduced cancer risk and increased intake of total fruits and vegetables combined and total vegetables for the entire cohort were similar (200 g/d increased intake of fruits and vegetables combined, HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.96 to 0.99; 100 g/d increased intake of total vegetables, HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.97 to 0.99); intake of fruits showed a weaker inverse association (100 g/d increased intake of total fruits, HR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.00). The reduced risk of cancer associated with high vegetable intake was restricted to women (HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.97 to 0.99). Stratification by alcohol intake suggested a stronger reduction in risk in heavy drinkers and was confined to cancers caused by smoking and alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: A very small inverse association between intake of total fruits and vegetables and cancer risk was observed in this study. Given the small magnitude of the observed associations, caution should be applied in their interpretation.",M2
20368648,"The spread of alcohol consumption behavior in a large social network.BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption has important health-related consequences and numerous biological and social determinants. OBJECTIVE: To explore quantitatively whether alcohol consumption behavior spreads from person to person in a large social network of friends, coworkers, siblings, spouses, and neighbors, followed for 32 years. DESIGN: Longitudinal network cohort study. SETTING: The Framingham Heart Study. PARTICIPANTS: 12 067 persons assessed at several time points between 1971 and 2003. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks per week on average over the past year and number of days <e>drinking</e> within the past week) and social network ties, measured at each time point. RESULTS: Clusters of drinkers and abstainers were present in the network at all time points, and the clusters extended to 3 degrees of separation. These clusters were not only due to selective formation of social ties among drinkers but also seem to reflect interpersonal influence. Changes in the alcohol consumption behavior of a person's social network had a statistically significant effect on that person's subsequent alcohol consumption behavior. The behaviors of immediate neighbors and coworkers were not significantly associated with a person's drinking behavior, but the behavior of relatives and friends was. LIMITATIONS: A nonclinical measure of alcohol consumption was used. Also, it is unclear whether the effects on long-term health are positive or negative, because alcohol has been shown to be both harmful and protective. Finally, not all network ties were observed. CONCLUSION: Network phenomena seem to influence alcohol consumption behavior. This has implications for clinical and public health interventions and further supports group-level interventions to reduce problematic drinking.",M2
20368572,"Testis cancer survivors' health behaviors: comparison with age-matched relative and demographically matched population controls.PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence rate of health behaviors in testis cancer survivors and to determine whether the rate of health behaviors in survivors was significantly different than those of their age-matched relative controls and a population-based control group matched for age, sex, education, and income. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The health behaviors of 162 testis cancer survivors were compared with their age-matched relative controls (n = 74) and an age-, sex-, education-, and income-matched population-based control group (n ranged from 1,123 to 9,775). Health behaviors were assessed with the telephone-administered Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance Survey. RESULTS: Nearly one in five testis cancer survivors reported current smoking and one third reported problem <e>drinking</e>. Only 11% reported having at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Compared with their relative controls, the survivors were more likely to engage in regular exercise. For those participants who drank, survivors were twice as likely to engage in problem drinking and averaged a higher number of drinks compared to their Centers for Disease Control (CDC) controls. Survivors were also half as likely to have at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day compared with the CDC controls. CONCLUSION: The overall picture regarding testis cancer survivors' health behaviors was mixed compared with the relative and CDC control groups. Our results suggest that reduced alcohol use and increased fruit and vegetable consumption may be important targets for future disease prevention in testis cancer survivors.",M2
20368518,"Functional NPY variation as a factor in stress resilience and alcohol consumption in rhesus macaques.CONTEXT: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) counters stress and is involved in neuroadaptations that drive escalated alcohol <e>drinking</e> in rodents. In humans, low NPY expression predicts amygdala response and emotional reactivity. Genetic variation that affects the NPY system could moderate stress resilience and susceptibility to alcohol dependence. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether functional NPY variation influences behavioral adaptation to stress and alcohol consumption in a nonhuman primate model of early adversity (peer rearing). DESIGN: We sequenced the rhesus macaque NPY locus (rhNPY) and performed in silico analysis to identify functional variants. We performed gel shift assays using nuclear extract from testes, brain, and hypothalamus. Levels of NPY in cerebrospinal fluid were measured by radioimmunoassay, and messenger RNA levels were assessed in the amygdala using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Animals were exposed to repeated social separation stress and tested for individual differences in alcohol consumption. Animals were genotyped for -1002 T &gt; G, and the data were analyzed using analysis of variance. SETTING: National Institutes of Health Animal Center. Subjects Ninety-six rhesus macaques. Main Outcome Measure Behavior arousal during social separation stress and ethanol consumption. RESULTS: The G allele altered binding of regulatory proteins in all nuclear extracts tested, and -1002 T &gt; G resulted in lower levels of NPY expression in the amygdala. Macaques exposed to adversity had lower cerebrospinal fluid NPY levels and exhibited higher levels of arousal during stress, but only as a function of the G allele. We also found that stress-exposed G allele carriers consumed more alcohol and exhibited an escalation in intake over cycles of alcohol availability and deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a role for NPY promoter variation in the susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and point to NPY as a candidate for examining gene x environment interactions in humans.",M2
20357499,"Corticosteroid nonprescription use: a cross-sectional hospital-based study in Basrah.OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and attitude of using nonprescription corticosteroids (oral or parenteral formulation of glucocorticosteroids) in Basrah, Iraq. METHODS: A face-to-face model structured interview was used to collect information from 682 patients between January 2006 and December 2008. The following information was obtained: age, gender, marital status, smoking, <e>drinking</e> of alcohol, occupation, educational level, social class and place of residence. RESULTS: Of the 682 (2.6%) subjects using nonprescription corticosteroids most were females: 471 (69%); married: 567 (83%); of low social class: 430 (63.1%); lived in the city center: 475 (69.6%). The majority (569, 83.5%) thought that corticosteroid use was safe and 463 (68.0%) did not feel guilty for using such medications. About half of them (377, 55.3%) were still using drugs at the time of presentation. Three hundred and fifty-seven (52.4%) reported that physicians advised them for the first time to use corticosteroids and the remaining 325 (42.2%) used it to become beautiful or marry. Three hundred and sixty-four (53.4%) patients obtained the drug from the pharmacy and 252 (36.9%) from street vendors. Weight gain was the main indication for use in 342 (50.1%) patients. Almost all had some features of corticosteroid side effects. CONCLUSION: This study showed high use of nonprescription corticosteroid in Basrah, Iraq. We therefore recommend educational programs to alert the population of the untoward side effects of corticosteroids.",M2
20356869,"Persistent high alcohol consumption in alcohol-preferring (P) rats results from a lack of normal aversion to alcohol.AIMS: In this study, we tested the impact of pretreatment with alcohol on subsequent alcohol <e>drinking</e> in outbred Sprague-Dawley and selectively bred alcohol-preferring (P) rats. METHODS: As a pretreatment, male Sprague-Dawley and P rats were given a passive oral administration of either alcohol (1.0 g/kg) or tap water. Then, they were given free choice of drinking alcohol (5% v/v) or water in their home cages, which was measured over 4 weeks. RESULTS: Without alcohol pretreatment, there was no significant strain difference in alcohol preference; both strains preferred 5% (v/v) alcohol solution. The strain difference was only apparent in the groups given alcohol pretreatment. This arose from the fact that alcohol pretreatment significantly reduced alcohol preference in the Sprague-Dawley rats to a level well below 50%, while it did not alter drinking behavior in P rats. The same effects were seen with total alcohol consumption (g/kg/day). These effects persisted throughout the 4 weeks of the study. CONCLUSIONS: The principal difference between the Sprague-Dawley and P rats was that the P rats did not show the normal aversion to alcohol after forced exposure to alcohol that the Sprague-Dawley rats showed. One of the potential contributors to high alcohol intake and preference in P rats may be lack of sensitivity to aversive effects of alcohol.",M2
20351238,"Alcohol intake and risk of coronary heart disease in younger, middle-aged, and older adults.BACKGROUND: Light to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. This protective effect of alcohol, however, may be confined to middle-aged or older individuals. Coronary heart disease incidence is low in men &lt;40 years of age and in women &lt;50 years of age; for this reason, study cohorts rarely have the power to investigate the effects of alcohol on coronary heart disease risk in younger adults. This study examined whether the beneficial effect of alcohol on coronary heart disease depends on age. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this pooled analysis of 8 prospective studies from North America and Europe including 192,067 women and 74,919 men free of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers at baseline, average daily alcohol intake was assessed at baseline with a food frequency or diet history questionnaire. An inverse association between alcohol and risk of coronary heart disease was observed in all age groups; hazard ratios among moderately <e>drinking</e> men (5.0 to 29.9 g/d) 39 to 50, 50 to 59, and &gt;or=60 years of age were 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36 to 0.93), 0.72 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.86), and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97) compared with abstainers. However, the analyses indicated a smaller incidence rate difference between abstainers and moderate consumers in younger adults (incidence rate difference, 45 per 100,000; 90% CI, 8 to 84) than in middle-aged (incidence rate difference, 64 per 100,000; 90% CI, 24 to 102) and older (incidence rate difference, 89 per 100,000; 90% CI, 44 to 140) adults. Similar results were observed in women. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol is also associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease in younger adults; however, the absolute risk was small compared with middle-aged and older adults.",M2
20348437,"Patterns of alcohol consumption in the Thai population: results of the National Household Survey of 2007.AIMS: The National Household Survey for Substance and Alcohol Use is a periodic survey of the Thai population with the aim of estimating the number of people who use licit and illicit substances. This paper reports the findings regarding alcohol consumption from the 2007 survey. METHODS: A multistage sampling scheme was used. Provinces, districts, sub-districts, villages and households were randomly selected in sequence. All residents aged 12-65 years who had lived in their current household for &gt;3 months were included. Altogether, 11,348 households and 26,633 respondents from 29 provinces were selected. A structured interview questionnaire, including information on pattern of alcohol consumption, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) and consequences of <e>drinking</e>, was used. RESULTS: Of Thais aged 12-65 years, 63% were abstainers (men-40.9% and women-81.5%). The prevalence of current drinkers (defined as individuals who drank at least 10 g of alcohol in 12 months before the survey) was 28.6% (men-48.4% and women-12.7%). Based on the AUDIT score, 6.7% of the Thai population could be classified as hazardous drinkers, 0.9% as harmful drinkers and 0.6% as probable alcohol dependents. The median drinking intensity was 50.8 g in men and 25.4 g in women. After adjusting for other variables, predictors of being hazardous-harmful or probably dependent drinkers included male gender, age groups of 20-24 and 25-44 years, not married and living in Bangkok. CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the gender and age differences in drinking patterns and drinking consequences in Thailand. These issues should be taken into consideration when planning preventive measures to reduce alcohol consumption and related problems.",M2
20338975,"In-utero exposure to smoking, alcohol, coffee, and tea and risk of strabismus.In a prospective, population-based cohort study, the authors investigated the effect of in-utero exposure to maternal smoking and consumption of alcohol, coffee, and tea on the risk of strabismus. They reviewed medical records for children in the Danish National Birth Cohort identified through national registers as possibly having strabismus. Relative risk estimates were adjusted for year of birth, social class, maternal smoking, maternal age at birth, and maternal coffee and tea consumption. The authors identified 1,321 cases of strabismus in a cohort of 96,842 Danish children born between 1996 and 2003. Maternal smoking was associated with a significantly elevated risk of strabismus in the child, increasing with number of cigarettes smoked per day (&lt;5 cigarettes/day: relative risk (RR) = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80, 1.14; 5-&lt;10 cigarettes/day: RR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.70; &gt; or =10 cigarettes/day: RR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.57, 2.30). Nicotine replacement therapy was not associated with strabismus risk (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.92, 1.61). Light maternal alcohol consumption was inversely associated with strabismus risk, whereas maternal coffee and tea <e>drinking</e> were not associated with strabismus risk. In conclusion, smoking during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of strabismus in the offspring. Conversely, light alcohol consumption is associated with decreased risk.",M2
20338493,"Alcohol consumption and cardiovascular mortality among U.S. adults, 1987 to 2002.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the association of alcohol consumption and cardiovascular mortality in the U.S. population. BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease in cohort studies, but this association has not been prospectively examined in large, detailed, representative samples of the U.S. population. METHODS: We analyzed 9 iterations of the National Health Interview Survey, an annual survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults between 1987 and 2000. Exposures of interest included usual volume, frequency, and quantity of alcohol consumption and binge <e>drinking</e>. Mortality was ascertained through linkage to the National Death Index through 2002. Relative risks were derived from random-effects meta-analyses of weighted, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for cardiovascular mortality from individual survey administrations. RESULTS: Light and moderate volumes of alcohol consumption were inversely associated with cardiovascular mortality. Compared with lifetime abstainers, summary relative risks were 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88 to 1.02) among lifetime infrequent drinkers, 1.02 (95% CI: 0.94 to 1.11) among former drinkers, 0.69 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.82) among light drinkers, 0.62 (95% CI: 0.50 to 0.77) among moderate drinkers, and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.10) among heavy drinkers. The magnitude of lower risk was similar in subgroups of sex, age, or baseline health status. There was no simple relation of drinking pattern with risk, but risk was consistently higher among those who consumed &gt;or=3 compared with 2 drinks/drinking day. CONCLUSIONS: In 9 nationally representative samples of U.S. adults, light and moderate alcohol consumption were inversely associated with CVD mortality, even when compared with lifetime abstainers, but consumption above recommended limits was not.",M2
20333794,"Cigarette smoking and alcohol <e>drinking</e> and esophageal cancer risk in Taiwanese women.AIM: To investigate the etiology of esophageal cancer among Taiwanese women. METHODS: This is a multi-center, hospital-based, case-control study. Case patients consisted of women who were newly diagnosed and pathology-proven to have esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) from three large medical centers (one from Northern and two from Southern Taiwan, respectively) between August 2000 and December 2008. Each ESCC patient was matched with 4 healthy women based on age (within 3 years) and hospital of origin, from the Department of Preventive Medicine in each hospital. A total of 51 case patients and 204 controls, all women, were studied. RESULTS: Frequencies of smokers and drinkers among ESCC patients were 19.6% and 21.6%, respectively, which were significantly higher than smokers (4.4%) and drinkers (4.4%) among controls (OR = 4.07, 95% CI: 1.36-12.16, P = 0.01; OR = 3.55, 95% CI: 1.03-12.27, P = 0.04). Women who drank an amount of alcohol more than 158 g per week had a 20.58-fold greater risk (95% CI: 1.72-245.62, P = 0.02) of ESCC than those who never drank alcohol after adjusting for other covariates, although the sample size was small. CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking, especially heavy drinking, are the major risks for developing ESCC in Taiwanese women.",M2
20308329,"Effects of the cognition-enhancing agent ABT-239 on fetal ethanol-induced deficits in dentate gyrus synaptic plasticity.Prenatal ethanol exposure causes deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning. At present, there are no clinically effective pharmacotherapeutic interventions for these deficits. In this study, we examined whether the cognition-enhancing agent 4-(2-{2-[(2R)-2-methylpyrrolidinyl]ethyl}-benzofuran-5-yl) benzonitrile (ABT-239), a histamine H(3) receptor antagonist, could ameliorate fetal ethanol-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) deficits. Long-Evans rat dams consumed a mean of 2.82 g/kg ethanol during a 4-h period each day. This voluntary <e>drinking</e> pattern produced a mean peak serum ethanol level of 84 mg/dl. Maternal weight gain, offspring litter size, and birth weights were not different between ethanol-consuming and control groups. A stimulating electrode was implanted in the entorhinal cortical perforant path, and a recording electrode was implanted in the dorsal dentate gyrus of urethane-anesthetized adult male offspring. Baseline input/output responses were not affected either by prenatal ethanol exposure or by 1 mg/kg ABT-239 administered 2 h before data collection. No differences were observed between prenatal treatment groups when a 10-tetanus train protocol was used to elicit LTP. However, LTP elicited by 3 tetanizing trains was markedly impaired by prenatal ethanol exposure compared with control. This fetal ethanol-induced LTP deficit was reversed by ABT-239. In contrast, ABT-239 did not enhance LTP in control offspring using the 3-tetanus train protocol. These results suggest that histamine H(3) receptor antagonists may have utility for treating fetal ethanol-associated synaptic plasticity and learning deficits. Furthermore, the differential effect of ABT-239 in fetal alcohol offspring compared with controls raises questions about the impact of fetal ethanol exposure on histaminergic modulation of excitatory neurotransmission in affected offspring.",M2
20307313,"Effects of body weight and alcohol consumption on insulin sensitivity.BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for the development of insulin resistance, which can eventually lead to type-2 diabetes. Alcohol consumption is a protective factor against insulin resistance, and thus protects against the development of type-2 diabetes. The mechanism by which alcohol protects against the development of type-2 diabetes is not well known. To determine the mechanism by which alcohol improves insulin sensitivity, we fed water or alcohol to lean, control, and obese mice. The aim of this study was to determine whether alcohol consumption and body weights affect overlapping metabolic pathways and to identify specific target genes that are regulated in these pathways. METHOD: Adipose tissue dysfunction has been associated with the development of type-2 diabetes. We assessed possible gene expression alterations in epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT). We obtained WAT from mice fed a calorie restricted (CR), low fat (LF Control) or high fat (HF) diets and either water or 20% ethanol in the <e>drinking</e> water. We screened the expression of genes related to the regulation of energy homeostasis and insulin regulation using a gene array composed of 384 genes. RESULTS: Obesity induced insulin resistance and calorie restriction and alcohol improved insulin sensitivity. The insulin resistance in obese mice was associated with the increased expression of inflammatory markers Cd68, Il-6 and Il-1alpha; in contrast, most of these genes were down-regulated in CR mice. Anti-inflammatory factors such as Il-10 and adrenergic beta receptor kinase 1 (Adrbk1) were decreased in obese mice and increased by CR and alcohol. Also, we report a direct correlation between body weight and the expression of the following genes: Kcnj11 (potassium inwardly-rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11), Lpin2 (lipin2), and Dusp9 (dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatase 9). CONCLUSION: We show that alcohol consumption increased insulin sensitivity. Additionally, alterations in insulin sensitivity related with obesity were coupled with alterations in inflammatory genes. We provide evidence that alcohol may improve insulin sensitivity by up-regulating anti-inflammatory genes. Moreover, we have indentified potential gene targets in energy metabolic pathways and signal transducers that may contribute to obesity-related insulin resistance as well as calorie restriction and alcohol-induced insulin sensitivity.",M2
20236746,"Alcohol use and social interactions among adolescents in Sweden: do peer effects exist within and/or between the majority population and immigrants?Are adolescents who attend schools with a high level of alcohol use and binge <e>drinking</e> more likely to use alcohol and binge drink themselves? This paper analyzes peer effects in adolescent drinking based on a survey of 13,070 adolescents conducted in Sweden in 2005. The empirical analysis uses a multi-level logistic model to account for non-observable heterogeneity between the schools and the results show that attending a school with a high level of alcohol use and frequent binge drinking is a strong predictor of alcohol use and binge drinking for the individual. Hardly any significant interaction effects are detected, implying that peer influence is similar across different adolescent sub-groups. Looking at adolescents with different ethnic backgrounds, it is found that the drinking-pattern of the Swedish majority population has a significant effect on drinking by Swedish individuals and immigrants from Nordic and European countries, but no effect on drinking by immigrants from non-European countries.",M2
20234066,"Alcohol use in Georgian students; pilot study rigorously following criteria of European school project on alcohol and other drug.The main purpose of the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) is to collect comparable data on substance use among 15-16 year-old European students in order to monitor trends within as well as between countries. In the article the results of the pilot study of Alcohol Use among Georgian Students, rigorously following Criteria of European School Project on Alcohol and Other Drug (ESPAD) are presented. The survey was conducted according to a standardized methodology and with a standardized questionnaire. Data were collected during February 2009 and the target population was Tbilisi students in the 10-th grade (93% born in 1992), with a mean age of 16.1 years at the time of data collection. Data were collected by group-administered questionnaires. The students answered the questionnaires anonymously in the classroom with researchers. The survey revealed that alcoholic beverages, especially beer and wine are considered easily available; 73% found beer and 70% wine easy to obtain. 90% of the surveyed students have tried alcohol at least once during their lifetime. 80% have done so in the last 12months and 40% in the past 30 days. Gender differences become apparent when frequency of use is considered: boys have used alcohol more often than girls. 7.5% of the students state that, they never drink alcohol at all. Wine and beer are the two most important types of beverage for the students. On average, 40% of students on the latest <e>drinking</e> day consumed wine and 38% - beer. Champagne and spirits consumed 29% and 22% of students, respectively. On average, half of the students have been intoxicated, at least once during their lifetime, to the point of staggering when walking, having slurred speech or throwing up. 40% reported intoxication in the last 12 months and 12% in the past 30 days. Another way to measure drunkenness is to ask about a specific amount of alcohol consumed within a certain period of time. The students were asked if they had had five drinks or more on one occasion during the past month; this is referred to here as  heavy episodic drinking , 40% reported this; more boys than girls did so (45% versus 33%). More than half of the questioned students had consumed at least one glass of alcohol at the age of 13 or younger, and 25% had been drunk at that age. Having been intoxicated during the past 30 days, in turn, co-varies both with anticipating more positive consequences from drinking and with having experienced more negative personal consequences when drinking. Alcohol remains the number one problem. The fact that more than 90% of respondents have had drunk alcohol at least once and that more than 43% have had their last drink at home and more than 27% at friend's home, indicates the great reflection of the cultural acceptance of alcohol within Georgian society and within Georgian families. The consumption level among adults and their attitudes towards the substance in question can be one factor that affects use among teenagers. So may the magnitude of information and preventive efforts. Availability, not only in physical terms but also in financial terms, is another factor. Other, less substance-related, factors include the general level of health awareness in a population and the social and economic structures and conditions of individual communities. The study showed the importance of knowledge of alcohol use and the necessity including the healthy lifestyle subject in school curricula.",M2
20230729,"Influence of heavy episodic <e>drinking</e> on the relation between men's locus of control and aggression toward intimate partners.OBJECTIVE: This study examined the interactive effects of locus of control and heavy episodic drinking on men's physical assault and sexual coercion against intimate partners. METHOD: Participants were 151 heterosexual drinking men who completed self-report measures of locus of control, alcohol consumption during the past 12 months, and intimate-partner aggression during the past 12 months. RESULTS: An internal locus of control was associated with a lower frequency of physical assault and sexual coercion toward intimate partners among men who reported lower quantities of alcohol consumption. However, data suggested that the protective qualities of an internal locus of control for both forms of partner aggression diminished among men who reported higher quantities of alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: These results support alcohol myopia theory and extend this theory by suggesting how alcohol consumption may affect the relation between locus of control and different forms of intimate-partner aggression toward women.",M2
20230726,"Metabolite levels in the brain reward pathway discriminate those who remain abstinent from those who resume hazardous alcohol consumption after treatment for alcohol dependence.OBJECTIVE: This study compared baseline metabolite levels in components of the brain reward system among individuals who remained abstinent and those who resumed hazardous alcohol consumption after treatment for alcohol dependence. METHOD: Fifty-one treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent individuals (abstinent for approximately 7 days [SD = 3]) and 26 light-<e>drinking</e> nonsmoking controls completed 1.5-T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, yielding regional concentrations of N-acetylaspartate, choline-containing compounds, creatine-containing compounds, and myoinositol. Metabolite levels were obtained in the following component of the brain reward system: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, superior corona radiata, and cerebellar vermis. Alcohol-dependent participants were followed over a 12-month period after baseline study (i.e., at 7 days of abstinence [SD = 3]) and were classified as abstainers (no alcohol consumption; n = 18) and resumers (any alcohol consumption; n = 33) at follow-up. Baseline metabolite levels in abstainers and resumers and light-drinking nonsmoking controls were compared in the above regions of interest. RESULTS: Resumers demonstrated significantly lower baseline N-acetylaspartate concentrations than light-drinking nonsmoking controls and abstainers in all regions of interest. Resumers also exhibited lower creatine-containing-compound concentrations than abstainers in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior corona radiata, and cerebellar vermis. Abstainers did not differ from light-drinking nonsmoking controls on baseline metabolite concentrations in any region of interest. CONCLUSIONS: The significantly decreased N-acetylaspartate and creatine-containing-compound concentrations in resumers suggest compromised neuronal integrity and abnormalities in cellular bioenergetics in major neocortical components and white-matter interconnectivity of the brain reward pathway. The lack of metabolite differences between abstainers and light-drinking nonsmoking controls suggests premorbid factors potentially contributed to the baseline brain metabolite abnormalities observed in resumers.",M2
20230723,"Concordance of adolescent reports of friend alcohol use, smoking, and deviant behavior as predicted by quality of relationship and demographic variables.OBJECTIVE: The strongest predictor of adolescent alcohol use is affiliation with friends who drink, use other drugs, or engage in deviant behavior. Most studies measure this variable using adolescent perceptions of friend problem behavior, but some research suggests these perceptions may be inaccurate. The current study's objective was to determine the concordance between adolescent perceptions of their friend's <e>drinking</e>, smoking, and deviant behavior and the friend's self-report. Relationship characteristics and demographic variables were explored as predictors of report concordance. METHOD: Participants (targets) were 232 adolescents ages 13 or 15 (53% girls) from Wave 9 of the Tween to Teen Project. At least one reciprocally endorsed friend participated for 59% of target adolescents (n = 232/390). Targets completed computer-assisted interviews. Friends completed telephone interviews. RESULTS: The relations between target perceptions of friend and friend self-reports of drinking and smoking were statistically significant (p &lt; .001), but concordance was driven largely by agreement regarding the absence of behavior. Although 22% of friends drank and 8.6% smoked, fewer than 60% of targets perceived these behaviors. Deviant behavior reports correlated moderately (r = .45), with 51% of adolescents underreporting friend deviance. There were few predictors of report concordance. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and their friends generally provided concordant reports of one another's drinking and smoking behaviors, but most agreement concerned the absence of behavior; most targets provided underreports of their friend's engagement in deviant behaviors. These findings suggest that adolescent perceptions of friends' problem behavior do not exaggerate the involvement of their friends in these behaviors.",M2
20230722,"Relationship between alcohol <e>drinking</e> and aspartate aminotransferase:alanine aminotransferase (AST:ALT) ratio, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and apolipoprotein A1 and B in the U.S. population.OBJECTIVE: The misuse of alcohol, even at levels just above two drinks per day, is a public health problem, but identifying patients with this potentially unhealthy drinking is hindered by the lack of tests. Several blood tests, such as those testing for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) or mean corpuscular volume (MCV), are among the commonly used markers to identify very heavy drinking, but combinations of these markers have rarely been tested in lighter drinkers. We examined the relationship between alcohol drinking and the levels of these markers in a national population-based study composed primarily of lighter drinkers. METHOD: Data were analyzed from 8,708 adult participants in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey after excluding subjects with iron overload; with hepatitis B and C; who were pregnant; and who were taking prescription drugs such as phenytoin (Dilantin), barbiturates, and hydroxyurea (Droxia and Hydrea). The relationship between the amount of alcohol drinking and GGT, aspartate aminotransferase:alanine aminotransferase ratio, MCV of erythrocytes, and apolipoprotein A1 and B were analyzed and adjusted for potential liver injury risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of unhealthy alcohol drinking (defined as consumption of more than two standard drinks per day) was 6.7%. Heavier drinkers tended to be younger and reported an average of 4.2 drinks per day. When tested alone or in combination, the sensitivity and positive predictive values for these blood tests were too low to be clinically useful in identifying the subjects in the heavier drinking category. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, national, population-based study, the markers of heavy drinking studied here, either alone or in combination, did not appear to be useful in identifying unhealthy drinking. More work is needed to find the novel marker(s) associated with risky alcohol drinking.",M2
20230721,"<e>Drinking</e>, driving, and crashing: a traffic-flow model of alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents.OBJECTIVE: This study examined the influence of on-premise alcohol-outlet densities and of drinking-driver densities on rates of alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes. A traffic-flow model is developed to represent geographic relationships between residential locations of drinking drivers, alcohol outlets, and alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes. METHOD: Cross-sectional and time-series cross-sectional spatial analyses were performed using data collected from 144 geographic units over 4 years. Data were obtained from archival and survey sources in six communities. Archival data were obtained within community areas and measured activities of either the resident population or persons visiting these communities. These data included local and highway traffic flow, locations of alcohol outlets, population density, network density of the local roadway system, and single-vehicle nighttime (SVN) crashes. Telephone-survey data obtained from residents of the communities were used to estimate the size of the resident drinking and driving population. RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses showed that effects relating on-premise densities to alcohol-related crashes were moderated by highway trafficflow. Depending on levels of highway traffic flow, 10% greater densities were related to 0% to 150% greater rates of SVN crashes. Time-series cross-sectional analyses showed that changes in the population pool of drinking drivers and on-premise densities interacted to increase SVN crash rates. CONCLUSIONS: A simple traffic-flow model can assess the effects of on-premise alcohol-outlet densities and of drinking-driver densities as they vary across communities to produce alcohol-related crashes. Analyses based on these models can usefully guide policy decisions on the sitting of on-premise alcohol outlets.",M2
20230718,"Transitioning into and out of problem <e>drinking</e> across seven years.OBJECTIVE: The extent to which problem drinkers transition into and out of problem drinking was examined using Markov modeling. METHOD: Study participants (N = 1,350) were randomly sampled from one county's general population and from consecutive admissions to public and private alcohol treatment programs in the same county, and they were assessed at 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year follow-ups. At baseline, all met the criteria for problem drinking. Individuals were classified as  problem drinkers  if they reported at least two of three criteria (heavy episodic drinking, social consequences, dependence symptoms according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) during the prior 12 months. RESULTS: Although all possible patterns were observed, a latent Markov model with heterogeneous transitions and five patterns fit the data. The sampling frame and baseline alcohol severity related to pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that, although they do change over time, problem drinkers on the whole are more likely either to remain problem drinkers or to cease to be problem drinkers than they are to move into and out of problem-drinking status. Once they transition out of problem drinking, they are more likely to remain nonproblem drinkers.",M2
20230715,"An ecological analysis of alcohol-outlet density and campus-reported violence at 32 U.S. colleges.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the relationships among campus violence, student <e>drinking</e> levels, and the physical availability of alcohol at off-campus outlets in a multisite design. METHOD: An ecological analysis of on-campus violence was conducted at 32 U.S. colleges. Dependent variables included campus-reported rates of rape, robbery, assault, and burglary obtained from a U.S. Department of Education online database for the years 2000-2004. Measures of student alcohol use and demographics were obtained from student surveys conducted for the Social Norms Marketing Research Project from 2000 to 2004. Measures of alcohol-outlet density within 3 miles of each campus were obtained from state alcohol-licensing authorities for 2004. RESULTS: Both on- and off-premise alcohol-outlet densities were associated with the campus rape-offense rate but not with the assault or robbery rates. Student drinking level was associated with both campus rape and assault rates but not with the campus robbery rate. The apparent effect of on-premise outlet density on campus rape-offense rates was reduced when student drinking level was included in the model, suggesting that the effect of on-premise outlet density may be mediated by student drinking level. Separate analyses revealed a similar mediational role for off-premise outlet density. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that there is a campus-level association between sexual violence and the campus-community alcohol environment.",M2
20230714,"Anticipated versus actual alcohol consumption during 21st birthday celebrations.OBJECTIVE: The 21st birthday celebration is often associated with excessive alcohol consumption. The current study examined whether individuals consume more alcohol than anticipated during their celebration and whether situational factors contribute to prediction errors. METHOD: College students (N = 150; 50% female) who planned to drink during their 21st birthday celebration were contacted by telephone 1 week before their celebrations and asked about their birthday plans, including anticipated alcohol consumption. The week after the celebration, in-person semi-structured interviews and self-report measures were administered to obtain information about the 21st birthday celebration, including type and amount of alcohol consumed, pace of <e>drinking</e>, influential peer involvement, and engagement in 21st birthday traditions. RESULTS: The majority of 21st birthday celebrants consumed more alcohol than they anticipated, with men showing greater prediction error than women. Situational factors were positively associated with the discrepancy between anticipated and actual alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Drinking shots, drinking at a fast pace, celebrating with influential peers, and engaging in 21st birthday traditions were associated with drinking more alcohol than anticipated during 21st birthday celebrations. Findings suggest future interventions that target situational factors could reduce excessive 21st birthday drinking.",M2
20230713,"Alcohol-consumption trajectories and associated characteristics among adults older than age 50.OBJECTIVE: This study examined changes in <e>drinking</e> behavior after age 50 and baseline personal characteristics and subsequent life events associated with different alcohol-consumption trajectories during a 14-year follow-up period. METHOD: Data were taken from the Health and Retirement Study. The study sample included individuals ages 51-61 in 1992 who survived the sample period (1992-2006) and had at least five interviews with alcohol consumption information, yielding an analysis sample of 6,787 (3,760 women). We employed linear regression to determine drinking trajectories over 1992-2006. Based on these findings, each sample person was classified into one of five drinking categories. We used multinomial logit analysis to assess the relationship between personal demographic, income, health, and attitudinal characteristics as well as life events and drinking-trajectory category. RESULTS: Overall, alcohol consumption declined. However, rates of decline differed appreciably among sample persons, and for a minority, alcohol consumption increased. Persons with increasing consumption over time were more likely to be affluent (relative-risk ratio [RRR] = 1.09, 95% CI [1.05, 1.12]), highly educated (RRR = 1.20, 95% CI [1.09, 1.31]), male, White (RRR = 3.54, 95% CI [1.01, 12.39]), unmarried, less religious, and in excellent to good health. A history of problem drinking before baseline was associated with increases in alcohol use, whereas the reverse was true for persons with histories of few or no drinking problems. CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial differences in drinking trajectories at the individual level in midlife and late life. A problem-drinking history is predictive of alcohol consumption patterns in later life.",M2
20230712,"Retired status and older adults' 10-year <e>drinking</e> trajectories.OBJECTIVE: Little research has examined the role of retirement in shaping late-life drinking careers, and it has generally been limited to cross-sectional designs or short-term follow-ups that emphasize group-level comparisons of retirees and nonretirees. The purpose of this study was to determine the following: (a) the effect of retired status on older adults' 10-year within-person drinking trajectories and (b) whether age, gender, income, health, and problem-drinker status account for or moderate this effect. METHOD: We first estimated older adults' (baseline M= 62 years; n = 595) 10-year within-person drinking trajectories using three successively predictive multilevel regression models: unconditional growth, retired status alone, and retired status controlling for covariates. Next, we determined whether inclusion of Retired Status x Covariate interactions would improve prediction of the trajectories. RESULTS: Participants' drinking frequency declined moderately over the 10-year interval, and retired status hastened the decline. However, this effect disappeared once covariates were added to the model: Baseline poorer health, lower income, and current problem-drinker status predicted steeper decline in drinking frequency, whereas former problem-drinker status predicted slower decline. Lower income and current drinking problems also predicted steeper declines in amount of alcohol consumed. There were no statistically significant or uniquely contributive interactions between retired status and age, gender, health, income, or drinking problems for predicting late-life drinking trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline health, income, and problem-drinking history are more important than retired status for predicting older adults' long-term within-person drinking trajectories. These factors-and recency of drinking problems-should be considered in future studies of retirement and late-life drinking patterns.",M2
20230077,"Daily work-family conflict and alcohol use: testing the cross-level moderation effects of peer <e>drinking</e> norms and social support.In the current study, we conducted daily telephone interviews with a sample of Chinese workers (N = 57) for 5 weeks to examine relationships between daily work-family conflict and alcohol use. Drawn from the tension reduction theory and the stressor-vulnerability model, daily work-family conflict variables were hypothesized to predict employees' daily alcohol use. Further, social variables (i.e., peer drinking norms, family support, and coworker support) were hypothesized to moderate the relationship between work-family conflict and alcohol use. Results showed that daily work-to-family conflict but not family-to-work conflict had a significant within-subject main effect on daily alcohol use. In addition, there was significant between-subject variation in the relationship between work-to-family conflict and alcohol use, which was predicted by peer drinking norms, coworker support, and family support. The current findings shed light on the daily health behavior consequences of work-family conflict and provide important theoretical and practical implications.",M2
20230073,"Alcohol consumption and workplace absenteeism: the moderating effect of social support.Although it is commonly assumed that alcohol consumption has a significant impact on employee absenteeism, the nature of the alcohol-absence relationship remains poorly understood. Proposing that alcohol impairment likely serves as a key mechanism linking <e>drinking</e> and work absence, we posit that this relationship is likely governed less by the amount of alcohol consumed and more by the way it is consumed. Using a prospective study design and a random sample of urban transit workers, we found that the frequency of heavy episodic drinking over the previous month is positively associated with the number of days of absence recorded in the subsequent 12-month period, whereas modal consumption (a metric capturing the typical amount of alcohol consumed in a given period of time) is not. In addition, consistent with both volitional treatments of absenteeism and social exchange theory, perceived coworker support was found to attenuate, and supervisory support to amplify, the link between the frequency of heavy episodic drinking and absenteeism.",M2

20224884,"Alcohol <e>drinking</e>, cigarette smoking, and the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus: epidemiology, clinical findings, and prevention.Both cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking are well-established risk factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and the relationship of dose to cancer risk has already been described. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of these two factors has been reported. Our case-control study revealed the odds ratio of ESCC to be 50.1 for those who were both heavy smokers and heavy drinkers in comparison to people who neither drank nor smoked. In patients with ESCC, head and neck cancers as well as dysplastic lesions are frequently observed. Heavy smoking and heavy drinking are closely related to such multicentric carcinogenesis events in the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT), including the esophagus and head andneck region. Polymorphisms in acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) are reported to be a key event in deciding individual susceptibility to UADT cancer. Patients with inactive ALDH2, in whom facial flushing is usually observed after the drinking of alcohol, are at high risk for ESCC as well as multiple UADT cancers. For the early detection of the disease, effective follow up using endoscopy with Lugol staining or narrow band imaging endoscopy is strongly recommended for high-risk populations, such as smokers, heavy drinkers, people with experience of flushing after the drinking of alcohol, and patients with UADT cancer.",M2
20224883,"Alcohol <e>drinking</e>, cigarette smoking, and the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus: molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis.Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common incident cancer in the world and ranks sixth among all cancers in mortality. Esophageal cancers are classified into two histological types; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and adenocarcinoma, and the incidences of these types show a striking variety of geographic distribution, possibly reflecting differences in exposure to specific environmental factors. Both alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking are major risk factors for the development of ESCC. Acetaldehyde is the most toxic ethanol metabolite in alcohol-associated carcinogenesis, while ethanol itself stimulates carcinogenesis by inhibiting DNA methylation and by interacting with retinoid metabolism. Cigarette smoke contains more than 60 carcinogens and there are strong links between some of these carcinogens and various smoking-induced cancers; these mechanisms are well established. Synergistic effects of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are also observed in carcinogenesis of the upper aerodigestive tract. Of note, intensive molecular biological studies have revealed the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of ESCC, including genetic and epigenetic alterations. However, a wide range of molecular changes is associated with ESCC, possibly because the esophagus is exposed to many kinds of carcinogens including alcohol and cigarette smoke, and it remains unclear which alterations are the most critical for esophageal carcinogenesis. This brief review summarizes the general mechanisms of alcohol- and smoking-induced carcinogenesis and then discusses the mechanisms of the development of ESCC, with special attention to alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking.",M2
20223875,"Body mass index and risk of liver cirrhosis in middle aged UK women: prospective study.OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation between body mass index (BMI) and liver cirrhosis and the contribution that BMI and alcohol consumption make to the incidence of liver cirrhosis in middle aged women in the UK. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study (Million Women Study). SETTING: Women recruited from 1996 to 2001 in NHS breast screening centres and followed by record linkage to routinely collected information on hospital admissions and deaths. PARTICIPANTS: 1 230 662 women (mean age 56 years at recruitment) followed for an average of 6.2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative risk and absolute risk of first hospital admission with or death from liver cirrhosis adjusted for age, recruitment region, alcohol consumption, smoking, socioeconomic status, and physical activity. RESULTS: 1811 women had a first hospital admission with or died from liver cirrhosis during follow-up. Among women with a BMI of 22.5 or above, increasing BMI was associated with an increased incidence of liver cirrhosis: the adjusted relative risk of cirrhosis increased by 28% (relative risk 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.38; P&lt;0.001) for every 5 unit increase in BMI. Although the relative increase in the risk of liver cirrhosis per 5 unit increase in BMI did not differ significantly according to the amount of alcohol consumed, the absolute risk did. Among women who reported <e>drinking</e> less than 70 g alcohol per week, the absolute risk of liver cirrhosis per 1000 women over five years was 0.8 (0.7 to 0.9) for those with a BMI between 22.5 and 25 and 1.0 (0.9 to 1.2) for those with a BMI of 30 or more. Among women who reported drinking 150 g alcohol or more per week, the corresponding figures were 2.7 (2.1 to 3.4) and 5.0 (3.8 to 6.6). CONCLUSIONS: Excess body weight increases the incidence of liver cirrhosis. In middle aged women in the UK, an estimated 17% of incident or fatal liver cirrhosis is attributable to excess body weight. This compares with an estimated 42% attributable to alcohol.",M2
20217944,"The feasibility of providing community pharmacy-based services for alcohol misuse: a literature review.OBJECTIVES: Excessive consumption of alcohol is a major public health concern. The use of community pharmacies and pharmacists as sources of public health information and services is gaining greater recognition. The objective of this review was to provide an overview of the evidence on the feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability of providing community pharmacy-based services to address the excessive consumption of alcohol. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for the period 1996-2007 to identify relevant evidence. Searches were also conducted of relevant pharmacy and addiction journals. Information was sought from key contacts in pharmacy and alcohol research. Studies were included if they were conducted in a community pharmacy setting. KEY FINDINGS: The review comprised three feasibility studies which included 14 pharmacies and 500 customers. Non-significant reductions in alcohol consumption were reported with two studies following brief interventions by pharmacists. Between 30% and 53% of pharmacy customers were identified as having hazardous or harmful <e>drinking</e> behaviour. Customer opinion of the pharmacy-based alcohol services was not reported. CONCLUSIONS: There has been little empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of community pharmacy-based services for alcohol misuse. The evidence presented in this review suggests that community pharmacy-based screening is feasible. Organisations and individuals involved with tackling excessive alcohol consumption should consider the inclusion of community pharmacies and pharmacists as part of their strategies to address this problem. Large-scale studies are needed to evaluate the short- and long-term effects and cost-effectiveness of community pharmacy-based interventions to reduce excessive alcohol consumption, as well as to explore the acceptability of the service to",M2

Men aged 35 to 54 years (n = 27 005) were divided into 6 groups by ethanol intake. The prevalence of multiple (&gt;or=3 or &gt;or=4) risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, high total cholesterol, triglyceride and fasting blood glucose, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, was compared among the groups in smokers and nonsmokers. Smokers and nonsmokers showed U- and J-shaped relationships, respectively, between alcohol intake and prevalence of multiple risk factors. Odds ratios of drinkers versus nondrinkers for multiple risk factors were significantly low in very light, light, moderate, and heavy drinkers in smokers and were significantly low in light and moderate drinkers but not in very low and heavy drinkers in nonsmokers. There is a U- or J-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis, and this relationship is modified by smoking.",M2

Findings showed that while they were often candid about the role of smoking and <e>drinking</e> in cancer onset and that of diet in cancer recurrence, body weight and exercise were rarely mentioned. Any reluctance to discuss the role of lifestyle factors in cancer onset and recurrence arose from a desire to minimize patient distress, limitations in specialists' knowledge of the causes of cancer and perceived inadequacy of the available causal explanations when risk factors are multiple and probabilistic.",M2
20201818,"Pre-clinical evidence that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor antagonists are promising targets for pharmacological treatment of alcoholism.Alcoholism is a chronic disorder characterized by cycling periods of excessive ethanol consumption, withdrawal, abstinence and relapse, which is associated with progressive changes in central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor signaling. CRF and urocortin peptides act by binding to the CRF type 1 (CRF1R) or the CRF type 2 (CRF2R) receptors, both of which have been implicated in the regulation of neurobiological responses to ethanol. The current review provides a comprehensive overview of preclinical evidence from studies involving rodents that when viewed together, suggest a promising role for CRFR antagonists in the treatment of alcohol abuse disorders. CRFR antagonists protect against excessive ethanol intake resulting from ethanol dependence without influencing ethanol intake in non-dependent animals. Similarly, CRFR antagonists block excessive binge-like ethanol <e>drinking</e> in non-dependent mice but do not alter ethanol intake in mice drinking moderate amounts of ethanol. CRFR antagonists also protect against increased ethanol intake and relapse-like behaviors precipitated by exposure to a stressful event. Additionally, CRFR antagonists attenuate the negative emotional responses associated with ethanol withdrawal. The protective effects of CRFR antagonists are modulated by CRF1R. Finally, recent evidence has emerged suggesting that CRF2R agonists may also be useful for treating alcohol abuse disorders.",M2
20200658,"Age differences in alcohol <e>drinking</e> patterns among Norwegian and German hospital doctors--a study based on national samples.AIMS: To describe and discuss the alcohol drinking patterns of the younger generation of hospital doctors in Norway and Germany - respectively the abstainers, frequent drinkers, episodic heavy drinkers and hazardous drinkers. METHODS: Data were collected in nationwide postal surveys among doctors in Norway (2000) and Germany (2006). A representative sample of 1898 German and 602 Norwegian hospital doctors aged 27-65 years were included in the analyses (N=2500). Alcohol drinking patterns were measured using the first three items of AUDIT in Norway and the AUDIT-C in Germany, scores of &gt;or=5 (ranking from 0 to 12) indicating hazardous drinking. Episodic heavy drinking was defined by the intake of &gt;or=60 g of ethanol, on one occasion, at least once a week. Frequent drinkers were who drank alcoholic beverages at least twice a week. Abstainers were persons who drank no alcohol. The analyses were performed separately for age groups (27-44 years versus 45-65 years) and genders. RESULTS: Compared to the age groups 45 to 65 years in the Norwegian and German samples, the younger age groups (27-44 years) tend to have higher rates of abstainers, higher rates of infrequent drinking of moderate amount of alcoholic drinks, lower rates of episodic heavy drinking and lower rates of hazardous drinking. CONCLUSION: The younger generation of hospital doctors in Norway and Germany showed tendencies to healthier drinking habits. Changes in professional life, and in the attitude towards alcohol consumption, may go some way towards explaining these findings.",M2
20198568,"Association between male infertility and androgen receptor mutations in Brazilian patients.The androgen receptor is encoded by a single-copy gene located in the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq11-12); it consists of eight exons and encodes an intracellular transcription factor that belongs to the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily. Disturbances in the function of the androgen receptor can lead to several forms of male pseudohermaphroditism, such as androgen insensitivity syndrome, which can lead to infertility. Infertility affects around 20% of couples, and in half of the cases it is a male problem. Seventy male patients with idiopathic infertility were selected; data were obtained on age, <e>drinking</e> and smoking habits, occupation, and family history. The mean age of the patients was 37 years old (standard deviation = 12.3); 44% were azoospermic, 33% were oligozoospermic and 24% did not have alterations in the spermogram. Our objective was to evaluate a possible association between male infertility and mutations in the androgen receptor gene based on the presence or absence of exons 1 and 4 of this gene. These two exons were tested by PCR, and their products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels. We found that azoospermic patients had higher mutation rates on exons 1 and 4 of the androgen receptor gene, when compared to other alterations that also lead to infertility, such as oligozoospermia and teratozoospermia. So, we conclude that patients who do not produce sperm have a higher number of mutations in the androgen receptor gene when compared to those who only have impaired sperm production. Based on molecular analysis, we found that there was no correlation between alterations in the spermogram and mutations on exons 1 and 4 of the androgen receptor gene and no association between alterations in the spermogram and alcohol drinking or smoking.",M2

METHODS: A total of 1575 Mongolian people aged 20 and older including 562 hypertensive and 1013 normal-tensive from agricultural and pastoral areas in Tongliao city of Inner Mongolia, were included in this study. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect data by personal interview with local residents, using a standard questionnaire. Fasting blood samples were drawn and height, weight and blood pressure were measured. The variant genotypes of CYP11B2, ACE and eNOS were identified by PCR assays. Gene-environment interactions were analyzed, using multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) model. Based on the result of the best MDR model, a multiple logistic regression model was constructed as the final cause-effect interpretative model. RESULTS: The interaction between CYP11B2 variant genotype and drinking index appeared the best MDR model with statistical significance (chi(2) = 66.35, P &lt; 0.01). Testing balance accuracy of the model was 0.604. The cross-validation consistency was 10/10. Data from the final multiple logistic regression based on the MDR model showed that the main effects of both CYP11B2 variant genotype and the DI were not significantly different but the interaction between the genotype (TC) and the DI (90-) was, with regard to hypertension (OR, 10.25; 95%CI, 2.23 - 47.18; P = 0.003). The combined effects between CYP11B2 variant genotype and the DI showed that following indices as: genotype TT or TC combining non-zero drinking index, including genotype (TT) combining the drinking index (&gt; or = 168), the genotype (TT) combining the drinking index (&gt; or = 40), the genotype (TT) combining the drinking index (&gt; or = 1) and the genotype (TC) combining the drinking index (&gt; or = 90), were all risk factors of hypertension when comparing with genotype (CC) combining the drinking index (0), and the ORs (95%CI) appeared to be 2.07 (1.15 - 3.70), 2.35 (1.22 - 4.56), 2.05 (1.07 - 3.94) and 5.56 (2.54 - 12.18) respectively.

20186179,"Tobacco, alcohol and drug use among dental undergraduates at one English university in 1998 and 2008.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of tobacco, alcohol and drug use among dental undergraduates at one English university in 2008, and compare these with prevalence in 1998. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey using an anonymous self-report questionnaire. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 2008 all 384 dental undergraduates at one English university were sent a questionnaire in order to obtain data on the frequency and amount of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and other illicit drugs used before and during their time as a dental undergraduate. The same survey had been conducted on dental undergraduates at the university 10 years earlier. RESULTS: Tobacco smoking was reported by 27% of males and 13.5% of females, a reduction from 1998 (42% of males and 32% of females) being significant among females. 63% of males and 69.5% of females reported <e>drinking</e> alcohol: significantly fewer than in 1998 (82% males and 90% females). Binge drinking was reported by 69.5% of males compared to 56% in 1998. In females 66% binged compared to 58.5% in 1998. The increase in males was significant. 62% of males and 68% of females had never used cannabis compared to 38% in males and 50.5% of females in 1998, a significant reduction. A significant reduction in amphetamine use was reported among both male and female undergraduates in 2008 compared to 1998 and a significant increase in amyl nitrate use was reported by females. Reported illicit drug use was associated with alcohol drinking, and particularly with tobacco use. CONCLUSION: Dental undergraduates at one English university in 2008 when compared to those in 1998 are reported to be significantly less likely to drink alcohol, use cannabis and amphetamines. If female, they are significantly less likely to smoke tobacco and overestimate the number of units of alcohol they can safely consume in a week, but more likely to use amyl nitrate. If male, those who drink alcohol are significantly less likely to drink at a level of increased risk, but more likely to binge drink.",M2
20183383,"Separating subjective norms, university descriptive and injunctive norms, and U.S. descriptive and injunctive norms for <e>drinking</e> behavior intentions.The theory of planned behavior and the social norms approach both stress the important influence that normative perceptions have on behavioral intentions and behavior. These 2 approaches were used to examine the behavioral intention to limit drinking to 0 to 4 drinks. Further, this study examined whether perception of subjective norms, university- and U.S.-level descriptive norms, and university- and U.S.-level injunctive norms represented separate dimensions for this behavioral intention. A representative sample of 1,100 undergraduate students completed a Web-based survey. The results confirmed that the 5 types of norms were all unique constructs and showed that individuals' intentions to limit their alcohol consumption to 0 to 4 drinks were predicted by positive attitudes, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, U.S. descriptive norms, and U.S. injunctive norms. Subjective norms also moderated the relationship between perceived behavioral control and behavioral intention. University descriptive norms served as a moderator between attitudes and behavioral intentions and between perceived behavioral control and behavioral intentions. This study has important implications for norms-based theories and campaigns.",M2

The study population includes Inuit, M√©tis, First Nation and non-Aboriginal residents aged 21-65 who live in Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Labrador, Nunavik and Jam√©sie in northern Quebec, and the northern regions of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Data are drawn from confidential versions of the 2000-2001 and 2004-2005 Canadian Community Health Surveys and the 2001 Aboriginal People's Survey produced by Statistics Canada. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis is applied to a set of health-related behaviours including cigarette smoking, binge <e>drinking</e> and obesity, and a set of basic health service use measures including consultation with a physician, consultation with a nurse, Pap smear testing and mammography. We found that significantly higher smoking and binge drinking rates and lower rates of female cancer screening among Inuit are found not to be accounted for by differences in observable demographic and socio-economic characteristics, location of residence or distance from a hospital. As such we conclude that health-related behaviours leading to increased cancer risk and to a lower utilization of diagnostic cancer screening appear to be due to unobserved factors specific to Inuit and their unique social-cultural context. Policy interventions to address these problems may need to be targeted specifically to Inuit Canadians and should not be considered in isolation of their broader health, economic and social environment.",M2

Although the medical and psychosocial consequences of youth obesity have been well documented, comparatively less information exists on the association of overweight/obesity with health-risk behaviors, which are considered to be a primary threat to adolescent health. PURPOSE: This study aims to examine the association of overweight and obesity with health-risk behaviors among U.S. youth. METHODS: Self-reported height and weight, substance use, violence, and bullying were assessed in a nationally representative sample of students aged 11-17 years (N=7825) who participated in the 2005-2006 Health Behaviors in School-Aged Children survey. Data were analyzed in 2009. RESULTS: Significant gender and age differences in the relationship of overweight/obesity with risk behaviors were observed. Overweight and obesity were significantly associated with substance use among girls only: Frequent smoking and <e>drinking</e> were associated with overweight and obesity among younger girls, whereas these behaviors were associated with obesity among older girls. Frequent smoking and cannabis use were associated with overweight among younger girls only. Relationships between violent behavior and overweight/obesity were mainly observed among boys: Younger obese boys were more likely to be victims of bullying, whereas older obese boys were more likely to carry weapons compared to boys of normal weight.

METHODS: The study population comprised respondents aged 25-64 (n = 79,100) replying to nationally representative annual postal surveys from 1982 to 2008 (average response rate 72%). The main measurements were the prevalence of respondents who had drunk at least eight (men) or five (women) drinks in the previous week ('moderate to heavy drinkers') and prevalence of those who weekly (men) or monthly (women) drank six or more drinks on a single occasion ('heavy episodic drinkers') (one 'drink' containing 11-13 g ethanol). Logistic models were used to test differences across population subgroups in the changes in <e>drinking</e>. RESULTS: Following the reduction of alcohol prices in 2004, drinking increased among men and women aged 45-64. Among men, both moderate to heavy drinking and heavy episodic drinking increased in the lowest educational group.

Men were significantly more likely than women to have initiated regular drinking during adolescence. Onset of regular drinking was not found to be heritable but was found to be significantly associated with a shorter time to onset of alcohol dependence. A high degree of similarity in the sequence of alcohol-related life events was found between men and women, however, men experienced alcohol dependence symptoms at a younger age and women had a more rapid clinical course. Women were found to have a higher heritability estimate for alcohol dependence (h(2)= .46) than men (h(2)= .32). These findings suggest that environmental factors influencing the initiation of regular drinking rather than genetic factors associated with dependence may in part underlie some of the gender differences seen in the prevalence of alcohol dependence in this population.

A total of 1,446 adults between 18 and 23 years of age and 2,482 adults between 24 and 32 years of age from the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Isle of Man, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom responded to questions about their drinking habits and the social consequences directly resulting from their drinking. Survey methods varied from quota sampling with face-to-face interviewing in Spain and the United Kingdom to telephone surveys in Denmark and Sweden. Response rates varied from 50% to 72%.  Binge  or  heavy episodic  drinking was defined as a usual amount on one occasion of more than 8 UK  units  for men and more than 6 units for women. Consequences investigated comprised relationship, health and financial problems, being asked to cut down on drinking, and being involved in a fight. In Denmark and Sweden, the group aged 24 to 32 years was less likely to be binge drinkers than the 18 to 23 year olds. In the other countries, there was little difference. There was also little difference between the age groups in frequency of drinking, but there were considerable variations in this respect between countries. People in the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and Denmark were more likely to suffer at least one consequence than those in Spain and the Isle of Man. In Spain, there was little change between the age groups in this respect. Fights were most common in the United Kingdom. Being asked to cut down one's drinking was less common in Spain and Sweden than it was elsewhere. Findings are discussed in terms of the varied drinking cultures in the different countries.",M2
20155599,"Mental health service utilization and <e>drinking</e> outcomes in a national population sample: are there racial/ethnic differences?Racial and ethnic disparities in alcohol use and alcohol-related problems have been well-documented. Less information is available about possible disparities in outcomes related to mental health services utilization. The differential effect of mental health services use by race on drinking outcomes was examined. Wave 2 of a national population sample of employed adults who reported having at least one alcoholic drink in the past year (N = 1,058) encompassed measures of the prevalence of mental health services use in response to stress, and alcohol-related outcomes. Non-white participants who reported using any mental health services, four or more mental health visits in the past year, and eight or more mental health visits in the past year reported lower rates of problematic drinking behaviors, including frequency of drinking to intoxication, heavy episodic drinking, and modified Brief MAST scores, than whites who reported similar use of mental health services.",M2
20155593,"Is self-reported  moderate  <e>drinking</e> in the cardiovascular benefit range associated with alcoholic behavior? A population based study.This article aims at identifying a threshold number of drinks per day beyond which there is a high risk of developing alcoholic behavior that would enable physicians to more confidently support the use of alcohol for cardiovascular risk prevention. In a randomly selected, population-based sample of 2,042 adults 45 years or older, we graded alcohol drinking behavior using the Self-Administered Alcoholism Screening Test, quantified alcohol amount by questionnaire, and assessed the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (coronary, peripheral, or cerebrovascular disease) by medical record review. Although optimal alcohol use (&lt; or = 2 drinks/day) was associated with reduced odds of cardiovascular disease, 43% of alcoholics and 82% of problem drinkers reported alcohol use in the optimal range as well. The association of alcohol use in the optimal range with alcohol-related behavioral problems supports the reluctance in physicians from recommending alcohol use for cardiovascular benefit, not withstanding the underreporting of alcohol use by alcoholics.",M2
20155519,"Older adults' health and late-life <e>drinking</e> patterns: a 20-year perspective.OBJECTIVES: This study focused on the associations between older adults' health-related problems and their late-life alcohol consumption and drinking problems. METHODS: A sample of 719 late-middle-aged community residents (55-65 years old at baseline) participated in a survey of health and alcohol consumption and this survey was followed 10 years and 20 years later. RESULTS: Health-related problems increased and alcohol consumption and drinking problems declined over the 20-year interval. Medical conditions, depressive symptoms, medication use, and acute health events were associated with a higher likelihood of abstinence; acute health events were also associated with less alcohol consumption. In contrast, reliance on alcohol to reduce pain was linked to more alcohol consumption. Moreover, an individual's overall health burden and reliance on alcohol to reduce pain were associated with more drinking problems. Reliance on alcohol to reduce pain potentiated the association between health burden, alcohol consumption and drinking problems. CONCLUSION: Older adults who have more health problems and rely on alcohol to manage pain are at elevated risk for drinking problems. Health care providers should target high-risk older adults, such as those who drink to reduce pain, for screening and brief interventions to help them identify new ways to cope with pain and curtail their drinking.",M2
20154449,"Impact of lifestyle on overall cancer risk among Japanese: the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study (JPHC Study).In Japan, cancer has long been recognized as a major component of the overall pattern of disease. Currently, there is a need to implement practical control measures with specific numerical targets appropriate for the Japanese population. Using data from the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study, the author estimated the impact of major risk factors on overall cancer risk among a Japanese population. These risk factors included tobacco smoking, alcohol <e>drinking</e>, body mass index, history of diabetes, physical activity, and metabolic factors and their aggregates. The results show that tobacco smoking and heavy alcohol drinking were significantly positively associated with overall cancer risk, and that total physical activity was significantly inversely associated with the risk of cancer. Although people with a history of diabetes may be at increased risk of cancer, extreme body mass index and metabolic factors in the aggregate had little impact on overall cancer risk in the Japanese population.",M2

This paper examines both risk and protective factors for frequent of alcohol, consumption in the Czech population using multilevel analysis. Risk factors were measured at the, individual level and at the area level. The individual-level data were obtained from a survey for a, sample of 3526 respondents aged 18-64 years. The area-level data were obtained from the Czech, Statistical Office. The group most inclinable to risk alcohol consumption and binge <e>drinking</e> are mainly, men, who live as single, with low education and also unemployed. Only the variable for divorce rate, showed statistical significance at both levels, thus the individual and the aggregated one. No cross-level interactions were found to be statistically significant.",M2

METHOD: This was a 1 month self report survey of postnatal women from 21 May-22 June 2006. A multiple choice questionnaire was handed out to them on the first or second postnatal day. RESULTS: There were a total of 117 deliveries. The questionnaire was completed by 100 of the 104 women who received it. Before pregnancy, 80% of women reported drinking alcohol; 66% binge drinking. Twenty-eight percent continued consuming alcohol throughout pregnancy. The majority did reduce or stop their alcohol consumption, 7% however did not. Ten percent were drinking more than 2 units per typical day and more than 7 units per week during pregnancy. Four percent was drinking a lot more than this. Nine percent of the total cohort reported binge drinking during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Just over a quarter of women drink alcohol throughout pregnancy. A significant minority of women drink relatively heavily (more than 4 units per occasion and multiple times per week) during pregnancy. Many women do reduce their alcohol use because of the pregnancy, but often only after they become aware of it. In New Zealand there is a real risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.",M2

20145341,"Association of the functional variant in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase gene with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in Japanese.BACKGROUND: The association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels has been well replicated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of white populations. Recently, the common intronic SNP of HMGCR (rs3846662) has been reported to be a functional variant, influencing the alternative splicing of exon 13. The aim of this study was to examine the association between rs3846662 of HMGCR and the level of LDL-C in Japanese. METHODS AND RESULTS: Significant differences in LDL-C levels were observed among the genotypes of rs3846662 (P=0.0002 (n=2,686) and P=0.004 (n=2,110)) for the Suita and Ehime samples, respectively. The G allele of rs3846662 was associated with higher LDL-C levels (beta, 3.56; P=4.91x10(-5)). Consistent with this observation, the risk G allele at rs3846662 was more prevalent in subjects with myocardial infarction (MI) (n=701) than in subjects without MI (n=3,118); 0.559 and 0.511 in MI cases and controls, respectively (nominal P=0.0038). The odds ratio adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, and <e>drinking</e> and smoking habits was 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.28; P=0.0075). CONCLUSIONS: The previously reported association of rs3846662 with LDL-C levels was replicated in the present Suita and Ehime samples. The LDL-associated SNP, rs3846662, appears to confer susceptibility to MI in Japanese.",M2
20150721,"Relation of Gamma-glutamyltransferase and alcohol <e>drinking</e> with incident diabetes: the HIPOP-OHP study.AIM: Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) is known to correlate well with alcohol consumption; however, the relation between GGT and diabetes and that between alcohol consumption and diabetes mellitus (DM) is inconsistent. Thus, several questions, such as whether light to moderate drinkers can be considered as low risk for diabetes incidence irrespective of their GGT level, is unresolved. In this study, we investigated the relation of GGT or alcohol drinking with DM incidence considering the body mass index (BMI) in healthy Japanese workers. METHODS: We followed 3095 men who did not have DM at baseline for 4 years. Incident diabetes was defined as a fasting (non-fasting) plasma glucose level of &gt;or=7.0 (11.1) mmol/L, or treatment of diabetes. Multiple adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox proportional models. RESULTS: Participants with higher GGT (GGT &gt;or=27 IU/L) showed an increased risk of diabetes incidence even when their BMI level was low. Although a U-shaped relation between alcohol drinking and incident diabetes was observed, the risk to light to moderate drinkers (alcohol &lt;23 g/day) was not low if they were either overweight (BMI &gt;or=25 kg/m(2)) or had higher GGT (HR=2.60, p=0.08) or both overweight and higher GGT (HR=3.16, p=0.07) compared with never drinkers without higher GGT and overweight. CONCLUSIONS: Higher GGT was associated with a higher incidence of DM irrespective of drinking status or obesity. Although a U-shaped relation between alcohol drinking and incident diabetes was observed, the risk to light to moderate drinkers was not low if they were either overweight or had higher GGT.",M2
20150170,"Twelve-month follow-up results from a randomized controlled trial of a brief personalized feedback intervention for problem drinkers.AIMS: To examine the impact of a web-based personalized feedback intervention, the Check Your <e>Drinking</e> (CYD; www.CheckYourDrinking.net) screener at 12-month follow-up. METHODS: Respondents (N = 185) were recruited from a general population telephone survey of Ontario, Canadian adults (&gt; or =18 years) by asking risky drinkers if they were willing to help develop and evaluate Internet-based interventions for drinkers. Those randomly assigned to the intervention condition were provided with the web address and a unique password to a study-specific copy of the CYD. Respondents assigned to the control condition were sent a written description of the different components of the CYD and asked how useful they thought each of the components might be. Respondents were followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: By the 12-month follow-up, the impact of the intervention previously reported at 3 and 6 months of CYD on problem drinkers' alcohol consumption was no longer apparent (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing that many people with alcohol concerns will never seek treatment, recent years have seen an increase in efforts to find ways to take treatment to problem drinkers. The CYD is one such intervention that has a demonstrated effect on reducing alcohol consumption in the short term (i.e. 6 months). Other more intensive Internet-based interventions or interventions via other modalities may enhance this positive outcome over the short and long term among problem drinkers who would be otherwise unlikely to access treatment for their alcohol concerns.",M2
