19655276,"Enhancement of human <e>gamma-interferon</e> production in recombinant E. coli using batch cultivation.Development of inexpensive and simple culture media and appropriate induction conditions are always favorable for industry. In this research, chemical composition and stoichiometric data for gamma-interferon production and recombinant Escherichia coli growth were used in order to achieve a simple medium and favorable induction conditions. To achieve this goal, the effects of medium composition and induction conditions on the production of gamma-interferon were investigated in batch culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) [pET3a-ifngamma]. These conditions were considered as suitable conditions for the production of gamma-interferon: 2.5x M9 medium, supplemented with a mixture of amino acids (milligram per liter), including glutamic acid 215, aspartic acid 250, lysine 160, and phenylalanine 90, and induction at late-log phase (OD(600) = 4.5). Under these conditions, dry cell weight of 6 +/- 0.2 g/l and gamma-interferon concentration of 2.15 +/- 0.1 g/l were obtained. Later, without changing the concentration ratio of amino acids and glucose, the effect of increase in the primary glucose concentration on productivity of gamma-interferon was investigated. It was found that 25 g/l glucose will result in maximum attainable biomass and recombinant human gamma-interferon. At improved conditions, a dry cell weight of 14 +/- 0.2 g/l, concentration and overall productivity of gamma-interferon 4.2 +/- 0.1 g/l and 420 +/- 10 mg/l h, respectively, were obtained.",M1
19335688,"Increased expression of CD208 (DC-LAMP) in epidermal keratinocytes of psoriatic lesions.Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation and infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of innate immunity involving dendritic cells (DC) and keratinocytes in psoriasis. We immunohistochemically examined the expression of DC markers such as CD1a, CD83, CD207 (Langerin), CD208 (DC-LAMP) and CD209 (DC-SIGN) in psoriatic skin and <e>gamma-interferon</e> (IFN-gamma)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-stimulated keratinocytes in vitro. CD208 was strongly expressed in basal and suprabasal layer keratinocytes in addition to DC in the perivascular lesions of the psoriatic dermis. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of CD208 in the perinuclear lesions of IFN-gamma-/TPA-stimulated keratinocytes was observed in vitro. Because a defect of the granular layer in psoriatic lesions has been recognized, increased expression of lysosome-related CD208 in the basal and suprabasal keratinocytes of psoriatic lesions might represent aberrant epidermal differentiation. Additionally, these CD208-positive keratinocytes possessing putative antigen-processing activity might play a key role as antigen-presenting cells in psoriatic skin.",M1
19165788,"Sensitivity of insulin production from encapsulated islets to endotoxin-stimulated macrophage inflammatory mediators.Chronic inflammation may compromise function of implanted encapsulated islets. Increased purity of alginate used for encapsulation prolongs encapsulated graft function, correlating with decreased presence of impurities like bacterial endotoxin. Limits for endotoxin contamination in biomaterials based on indirect inhibition of function of embedded cells have yet to be established. In a coculture system with RAW 264.7 monocyte/macrophage cells in the presence of 50 ng/mL murine recombinant <e>gamma-interferon</e> (mrIFN-gamma), the insulin response to glucose challenge of both rat and pig unencapsulated islets was prevented by endotoxin (LPS) in the medium down to 0.3 EU/mL (LOEL), but not 0.06 EU/mL (NOEL). Evaluation of nitrite concentrations in supernatants revealed that pig islets were more resistant to LPS-stimulated macrophage mediators than rat islets. Encapsulation in highly purified alginate produced little change in observed inhibitory effects of macrophage-generated nitric oxide (NO) toward islet function. Chemically released NO was much less effective in inhibiting insulin responsiveness to glucose challenge than was coculture of islets with LPS and mrIFN-gamma-stimulated RAW 264.7. These results taken together with other data suggest that an upper limit of 0.3 EU/mL LPS within the encapsulating alginate will not impair the function of implanted encapsulated islets by toxic concentrations of macrophage-mediated inflammatory agents.",M1
18838522,"Porphyromonas gingivalis, <e>gamma interferon</e>, and a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix form a synergistic trio that induces c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1-mediated nitric oxide generation and cell death.During infection and inflammation, bacterial and inflammatory proteases break down extracellular matrices into macromolecular fragments. Fibronectin fragments are associated with disease severity in arthritis and periodontitis. The mechanisms by which these fragments contribute to disease pathogenesis are unclear. One likely mechanism is that fibronectin fragments induce apoptosis of resident cells, which can be further modulated by nitric oxide. Nitric oxide levels are increased at inflammatory sites in periodontitis patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix (AFn) exerts its action by inducing nitric oxide and whether priming by bacterial and inflammatory components exacerbates this mechanism. Our data demonstrate that AFn increased the levels of nitric oxide and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) dose and time dependently in periodontal ligament (PDL) cells. These effects and apoptosis were inhibited by iNOS suppression and enhanced by iNOS overexpression. Nitric oxide and iNOS induction were paralleled by increased c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK-1) phosphorylation. JNK-1 overexpression enhanced the expression of nitric oxide and iNOS, whereas inhibiting JNK-1 by small interfering RNA or a kinase mutant reversed these findings. Priming PDL cells with Porphyromonas gingivalis, its lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) further increased nitric oxide levels and apoptosis. Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans induced lesser effects. Gingival fibroblasts and neutrophils responded to a lesser degree to these stimuli, whereas keratinocytes were resistant to apoptosis. Thus, proapoptotic matrices trigger nitric oxide release via JNK-1, promoting further apoptosis in host cells. LPS and IFN-gamma accentuate this mechanism, suggesting that during inflammation, the affected matrices and bacterial and inflammatory components combined exert a greater pathogenic effect on host cells.",M1
18457879,"Characterisation of <e>gamma-interferon</e> responsive promoters in fish.Reporter constructs of three interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced rainbow trout genes were generated to examine specificity to type I or type II IFN. Constructs included gammaIP-10, LMP2 and TAP2 and were used to transfect trout fibroblast cells (RTG-2) which were then exposed to rainbow trout rIFNs. The gammaIP-10 construct showed high reporter activity even in the absence of rIFNs. The LMP2 promoter contained one GAS element and two double ISRE elements, of four constructs made, only those with ISRE elements showed significant reporter activity following rIFN-gamma stimulation. The TAP2 regulatory region contained two GAS, two ISRE and one C/EBP element from which four constructs were made. Reporter expression for the construct containing all five elements showed an 11- and 2-fold increase in response to rIFN-gamma and type I rIFN, respectively. Constructs containing only the GAS elements did not respond to rIFNs. The TAP2 construct with two ISRE and the C/EBP gave the greatest dose-dependent reporter response to rIFN-gamma, with no significant response to type I rIFN. These data suggest that the ISRE elements, or elements nearby, are essential for the induction of type II IFN responsive genes in trout. The TAP2 construct is a candidate to develop a IFN-gamma reporter stable cell line.",M1
17893127,"<e>Gamma interferon</e> confers resistance to infection with Staphylococcus aureus in human vascular endothelial cells by cooperative proinflammatory and enhanced intrinsic antibacterial activities.Vascular endothelium is an exposed target in systemic endovascular Staphylococcus aureus infections. We reported earlier that the proinflammatory and procoagulant activities of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) after binding and ingestion of S. aureus organisms provide the cells effective means for leukocyte-mediated bacterial elimination. Expanding on this, we now show that these ECs exhibit a modest intrinsic capacity for eliminating intracellular S. aureus that was influenced by cytokines relevant to S. aureus infections. Using various EC infection assays, we showed that gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), applied to cultures of ECs prior to or after infection with S. aureus, markedly reduced the level of infection, illustrated by lower percentages of S. aureus-infected ECs and less intracellular bacteria per infected cell. IFN-gamma-activated ECs had unaltered abilities to bind S. aureus and processed ingested bacteria by a seemingly conventional phagocytic pathway. IFN-gamma treatment rescued EC monolayers from severe injury by virulent clinical S. aureus strains or excessive bacterial numbers. Mechanistically, IFN-gamma controls S. aureus infection via IFN-gamma receptor, most likely through stimulation of intrinsic endothelial antibacterial mechanisms but independent of processes that deprive bacteria of intracellular L-tryptophan or iron. The antibacterial activity of IFN-gamma-stimulated ECs coincided with sustained or slightly elevated endothelial proinflammatory responses that supported monocyte recruitment. In conclusion, we identify IFN-gamma as a potent regulatory Th1 cytokine possessing exclusive abilities to augment intrinsic antistaphylococcal effector mechanisms in human ECs without ablating the S. aureus-induced proinflammatory EC responses and, as such, coordinating a protective efficacy of ECs against blood-borne S. aureus infection.",M1
17889355,"Induction of autologous graft-versus-host disease: results of a randomized prospective clinical trial in patients with poor risk lymphoma.The results of blood or marrow transplantation in patients with chemorefractory aggressive lymphoma, that is, those not responding to conventional-dose chemotherapy at the time of transplant, have been poor. The relapse rate has been high after autologous bone marrow transplant, whereas allogeneic transplantation has been associated with excessive transplant-related toxicity. Administration of cyclosporine after autologous transplantation can induce an autoreactive syndrome that resembles graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This syndrome, named autologous graft-versus-host disease, has clear antitumor activity in animal models that can be enhanced by the addition of cytokines such as <e>gamma-interferon</e> and interleukin-2. A randomized, prospective study was conducted to evaluate the antitumor effect of autologous graft-versus-host disease induced with cyclosporine, and augmented by the administration of gamma-interferon and interleukin-2 in patients with chemorefractory Hodgkin and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Fifty-one patients were randomized, 24 to the autologous GVHD induction arm, and 27 to the noninduction arm after autologous transplant using mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts. There were no differences in treatment-related mortality, overall and event-free survival (OS, EFS) between both groups; however, in the induction arm, GVHD developed only in 4 patients. The administration of oral cyclosporine followed by interleukin-2 and gamma-interferon is generally not well tolerated, and does not appear to be an effective method to induce autologous GVHD in patients receiving autologous PBSC grafts.",M1
17220551,"Neuraminidase inhibitors reduce nitric oxide production in influenza virus-infected and <e>gamma interferon</e>-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages.The influenza virus (influenza) infection causes an intense infiltration of pulmonary tissues by macrophages, which abundantly generate a free radical, nitric oxide (NO) resulting in lung damage. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) restrict influenza virus replication but whether they can suppress NO production within macrophages is unknown. RAW 264.7 macrophages were exposed to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), live influenza (A/PR/8/34) or a combination of both and were treated with NIs (oseltamivir or zanamivir). Results revealed that the drugs reduced a synergy between influenza and IFN-gamma in NO synthesis within the cells at all of the used concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1 microg/ml). In contrast to zanamivir, this effect occurred in a concentration-dependent manner with oseltamivir treatment. On the other hand, all concentrations of zanamivir significantly suppressed NO production in comparison to that upon the combined exposure only (p &lt; 0.05). Both compounds also considerably decreased NO generation in the IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages, and zanamivir in the influenza-infected cells as well. However, neither of the drugs inhibited iNOS mRNA expression in the cells containing these stimulants. Additionally, the data indicate that a prodrug oseltamivir can be activated in vitro within the macrophage cultures. These findings are important for designing treatment approaches to limit pulmonary inflammation during influenza infection.",M1
17166912,"Pseudotyped single-cycle simian immunodeficiency viruses expressing <e>gamma interferon</e> augment T-cell priming responses in vitro.To increase the safety and efficacy of human immunodeficiency virus vaccines, several groups have conducted studies using the macaque model with single-cycle replicating simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). However, these constructs had poor or diminished efficacy compared to live attenuated vaccines. We previously showed that immunization of macaques with live attenuated SIV with a deletion in the nef gene and expressing gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) results in significantly enhanced safety and efficacy. To further enhance safety, we constructed and characterized single-cycle SIVs, pseudotyped with the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus, expressing different levels of macaque IFN-gamma. Expression of IFN-gamma did not alter the infectivity or antigenicity of pseudotyped SIV. The transduction of dendritic cells (DCs) by IFN-gamma-expressing particles resulted in the up-regulation of costimulatory and major histocompatibility complex molecules. Furthermore, T cells primed with DCs transduced by SIV particles expressing high levels of IFN-gamma and then stimulated with SIV induced significantly higher numbers of spot-forming cells in an enzyme-linked immunospot assay than did T cells primed with DCs transduced with SIV particles lacking the cytokine. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the transduction of DCs in vitro with pseudotyped single-cycle SIVs expressing IFN-gamma increased DC activation and augmented T-cell priming activity.",M1
16928759,"The unique C termini of orthopoxvirus <e>gamma interferon</e> binding proteins are essential for ligand binding.The orthopoxviruses ectromelia virus (ECTV) and vaccinia virus (VACV) express secreted gamma interferon binding proteins (IFN-gammaBPs) with homology to the ligand binding domains of the host's IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR1). Homology between these proteins is limited to the extracellular portions of the IFN-gammaR1 and the first approximately 200 amino acids of the IFN-gammaBPs. The remaining 60 amino acids at the C termini of the IFN-gammaBPs contain a single cysteine residue shown to be important in covalent dimerization of the secreted proteins. The function of the remaining C-terminal domain (CTD) has remained elusive, yet this region is conserved within all orthopoxvirus IFN-gammaBPs. Using a series of C-terminal deletion constructs, we have determined that the CTD is essential for IFN-gamma binding despite having no predicted homology to the IFN-gammaR1. Truncation of the ECTV IFN-gammaBP by more than two amino acid residues results in a complete loss of binding activity for both murine IFN-gamma and human IFN-gamma (hIFN-gamma), as measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and bioassay. Equivalent truncation of the VACV IFN-gammaBP resulted in comparable loss of hIFN-gamma binding activity by SPR. Full-length IFN-gammaBPs were observed to form higher-ordered structures larger than the previously reported dimers. Mutants that were unable to bind IFN-gamma with high affinity in SPR experiments failed to assemble into these higher-ordered structures and migrated as dimers. We conclude that the unique CTD of orthopoxvirus IFN-gammaBPs is important for the assembly of covalent homodimers as well as the assembly of higher-ordered structures essential for IFN-gamma binding.",M1
16700092,"In vitro effect of adenovirus-mediated human <e>Gamma Interferon</e> gene transfer into human mesenchymal stem cells for chronic myelogenous leukemia.For developing gene therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), we evaluated the feasibility of using autologous bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) of one CML patient as a target cell population and studied the efficiency of recombinant adenovirus-mediated human Gamma Interferon (hIFN-gamma) gene transfer into BMSCs. BMSCs can be readily obtained, expanded, and successfully transduced with adenoviral vectors in vitro. We studied the in vitro expression of hIFN-gamma in human BMSCs following transduction with Ad/hIFN-gamma. On transduction of BMSCs at a MOI of 50, the expression and secretion of hIFN-gamma were achieved as high as 5492 +/- 660 approximately 50647 +/- 4049 ng/10(6) cells per 24 h over the course of 3 weeks. We further studied the effects of hIFN-gamma produced by transduced BMSCs on the proliferation of the human leukemia cell line K562 cells in vitro, proliferation of K562 cells was markedly inhibited in the experimental groups as compared with the other two control groups after 5 days of coculture. We also found that the percentage of K562 cells in the G(1) phase of cell cycle can be increased by treatment of hIFN-gamma produced by Ad/hIFN-gamma transduced BMSCs, but the percentage of K562 cells in the S phase of cell cycle can be decreased in the same time. Apoptosis rate of K562 cells in the experimental groups was 30.8 +/- 8.5%, as compared with the other two control groups (5.6 +/- 1.3% and 5.5 +/- 0.8%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.01). Our results indicate that hIFN-gamma gene engineered BMSCs of CML donors could be successfully established and that local production of hIFN-gamma is sufficiently to inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells and induce apoptosis of K562 cells in vitro, suggesting an important potential use in the clinical gene therapy of CML.",M1
16686217,"[Optimization of cultivation conditions of recombinant Escherichia coli strain KPR-42--producer of human <e>gamma-interferon</e>]Cultivation conditions for recombinant Escherichia coli strain KPR-42 producing human gamma-interferon in liquid nutrient medium were optimized. Glucose content in the medium was optimized by the reason that glucose catabolism products cause the medium acidification. That permitted to prolong fermentation time and increase recombinant protein content in the cells by 23-25%, avoiding expendable enrichment of the medium by nutrient components.",M1
16579477,"[Detection for the antiviral activity and primary application of the chicken <e>gamma interferon</e> in yeast Pichia pastoris]To obtain recombinant chicken interferon gamma (ChIFN-gamma) with natural antivirus bioactivity in yeast Pichia pastoris eukaryotic expression system, the cDNA of chicken interferon gamma mature protein was synthesized by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)from the total mRNA of the lymphocyte from chicken blood, which stimulated with Con A for 4 to approximately 10 hours. The 493 bp nucleotide sequence of chicken interferon gamma mature protein was cloned into expression vector pPICZa-A, which had been cleaved between EcoR I and Xba I . After linearized by BstX I, the recombinant vector was transferred into yeast Pichia pastoris, strain X33. The recombinant strain was isolated and identified by polymerase chain reaction. After induced by methanol, the recombinant protein was examined by SDS-PAGE. The result of SDS-PAGE analysis in the concentrated fermentation supernatant showed that the molecular weight of the recombinant protein was approximate 16kDa, two recombinants were conformed to secrete chicken interferon gamma(16kDa). The classical experiment of detection for interferon activity (cell pathological Effect Inhibition Assay)and the preliminary result of therapy proved that the recombinant protein is of good antivirus activity. So far chicken interferon gamma had been expressed highly in E. coli, but it tend to form biologically inactive inclusion bodied combined with difficulties in refolding, so the recombinant chicken gamma interferon with natural antivirus bioactivity produced in yeast expression system is the best way, the recombinant interferon gamma have great practical value and application foreground.",M1
16368975,"Production and characterization of guinea pig recombinant <e>gamma interferon</e> and its effect on macrophage activation.Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) plays a critical role in the protective immune responses against mycobacteria. We previously cloned a cDNA coding for guinea pig IFN-gamma (gpIFN-gamma) and reported that BCG vaccination induced a significant increase in the IFN-gamma mRNA expression in guinea pig cells in response to living mycobacteria and that the virulent H37Rv strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis stimulated less IFN-gamma mRNA than did the attenuated H37Ra strain. In this study, we successfully expressed and characterized recombinant gpIFN-gamma with a histidine tag at the N terminus (His-tagged rgpIFN-gamma) in Escherichia coli. rgpIFN-gamma was identified as an 18-kDa band in the insoluble fraction; therefore, the protein was purified under denaturing conditions and renatured. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the recombinant protein yielded the sequence corresponding to the N terminus of His-tagged gpIFN-gamma. The recombinant protein upregulated major histocompatibility complex class II expression in peritoneal macrophages. The antiviral activity of rgpIFN-gamma was demonstrated with a guinea pig fibroblast cell line (104C1) infected with encephalomyocarditis virus. Interestingly, peritoneal macrophages treated with rgpIFN-gamma did not produce any nitric oxide but did produce hydrogen peroxide and suppressed the intracellular growth of mycobacteria. Furthermore, rgpIFN-gamma induced morphological alterations in cultured macrophages. Thus, biologically active rgpIFN-gamma has been successfully produced and characterized in our laboratory. The study of rgpIFN-gamma will further increase our understanding of the cellular and molecular responses induced by BCG vaccination in the guinea pig model of pulmonary tuberculosis.",M1
16333333,"Effect of nitric oxide on the growth of Chlamydophila pneumoniae.Chlamydophila pneumoniae is an important human intracellular pathogen; however, the pathogenesis of C. pneumoniae infection is poorly understood and the immune control mechanism versus host cells is not completely known. The role of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase pathway in inhibiting the ability of C. pneumoniae to infect macrophage J774 cells and the ability of NO to damage isolated C. pneumoniae were investigated. Exposure of infected cultures to recombinant murine <e>gamma interferon</e> (MurIFN-gamma) resulted in increased production of NO and reduced viability. Addition of 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolase-2-oxide before infection of J774 cells or during chlamydial cultivation released NO, both resulting in a reduction in the viability of C. pneumoniae in a dose-dependent way. These results indicate that immune control of chlamydial growth in murine macrophage cells may trigger a mechanism that includes NO release with effects on the multiplication of the microorganism, thus suggesting that NO may play a role in preventing the systemic spread of Chlamydia.",M1
16028528,"[Influence of cytokine preparations on the in vitro resistance of bacteria to antibiotics]Recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha and <e>gamma-interferon</e> were found in vitro to increase the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics both alone and in combination; alpha2-interferon decreased this sensitivity.",M1
16019194,"Involvement of the virulence gene products of Yersinia enterocolitica in the immune response of infected mice.The virulence of Yersinia enterocolitica is known to be highly dependent on its virulence plasmid. However, it remains unclear whether the virulence plasmid is engaged also in the induction of cell-mediated immunity that is essential for protective immunity in the host. In this study, we have compared the induction of type 1 helper T cell immunity against Y. enterocolitica using a virulent strain (P+) harboring the pYV plasmid and an avirulent strain (P-) harboring no pYV. Spleen cells from both groups of mice immunized with 1/10 LD50 of P+ strain and those with 1/10 LD50 of P- strain produced a high level of <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) upon stimulation with heat-killed bacteria, and CD4+ T cells were exclusively responsible for IFN-gamma production. When crude Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) were used for antigenic stimulation, IFN-gamma response of immune spleen cells against crude Yops was observed only in mice immunized with P+ strain. Flowcytometric analysis revealed a significant level of increase in IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells as well as the increase in IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ T cells against crude Yops. These results suggest that the virulence plasmid of Y. enterocolitica is involved in the induction of Th1-type of possibly protective T cells in infected mice.",M1
15908373,"<e>Gamma interferon</e> enhances internalization and early nonoxidative killing of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium by human macrophages and modifies cytokine responses.Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is a critical cytokine in host defense against salmonella infections, but its role in phagocytic killing of intracellular Salmonella spp. has been investigated mainly in animal rather than human cells. We measured the effect of recombinant IFN-gamma (rIFN-gamma) priming on bacterial internalization, intracellular killing, oxidative burst, and cytokine release during phagocytosis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium by human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Eleven-day-old MDM, primed for 72 h with rIFN-gamma (100 ng/ml) exhibited an increased proportion of cells with associated bacteria (31% versus 26%, P = 0.036) and a 67% increase in internalized bacteria per cell compared to unprimed cells (P = 0.025). Retrieval of viable bacteria following internalization was reduced 3.6-fold in 72-h primed versus unprimed MDM (interquartile range, 3.1 to 6.4) at 0.5 h due to enhanced early intracellular killing, and this difference was maintained up to 24 h. In contrast, cells primed for only 24 h exhibited no increase in early killing. MDM were competent to produce an early oxidative burst when stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate, which was fully abrogated by the respiratory burst inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), but infection of MDM with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium did not cause an increase in the early respiratory burst under unprimed or primed conditions, and DPI had no effect on the early killing of bacteria by primed or unprimed MDM. During 24 h following infection, rIFN-gamma-primed MDM released more interleukin-12 (IL-12) and less IL-10 relative to unprimed cells. We conclude that 72-h priming with rIFN-gamma increases the efficiency of internalization and nonoxidative early intracellular killing of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium by human macrophages and modifies subsequent cytokine release.",M1
15827152,"<e>Gamma interferon</e>-dependent, noncytolytic clearance of sindbis virus infection from neurons in vitro.Due to the nonrenewable nature of neurons, recovery from viral infection of the central nervous system requires noncytopathic mechanisms for control of virus replication. Recovery from alphavirus encephalitis can occur without apparent neurological damage through the effects of antibody and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). To establish an in vitro cell culture system that will allow the study of mechanisms of IFN-gamma-mediated control of Sindbis virus (SINV) replication in neurons, we have characterized the susceptibility to SINV infection and IFN-gamma responsiveness of two neuronal cell lines that can be differentiated in vitro: CSM14.1, a rat nigral cell line, and NSC34, a mouse motor neuron cell line. Undifferentiated CSM14.1 and NSC34 cells were permissive for SINV and susceptible to virus-induced cell death. With differentiation, CSM14.1 cells reduced virus replication and became progressively resistant to virus-induced cell death, resulting in prolonged virus replication. NSC34 cells did not differentiate completely and became only partially resistant to SINV infection. Both CSM14.1 and NSC34 cells responded to pretreatment with IFN-gamma by decreasing SINV replication. Differentiated CSM14.1 cells treated 24 h after infection with IFN-gamma responded with increased cell viability and clearance of infectious virus. IFN-gamma treatment sequentially altered the ratio of genomic to subgenomic viral RNA synthesis, promoted recovery of cellular protein synthesis, reduced viral protein synthesis, and inhibited viral RNA transcription within 24 h after treatment. We conclude that CSM14.1 cells provide an excellent model for the study of IFN-gamma-mediated noncytolytic clearance of SINV from mature neurons.",M1
15708999,"Viral replication-independent blockade of dendritic cell maturation and interleukin-12 production by human herpesvirus 6.Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a potentially immunosuppressive CD4(+)-T-lymphotropic betaherpesvirus that causes severe human thymocyte depletion in heterochimeric SCID-hu thy/liv mice and has been implicated as a potential cofactor in the progression of AIDS. However, the mechanisms of HHV-6-mediated immunosuppression have not yet been fully elucidated. We investigated the phenotypic and functional alterations induced by HHV-6 on peripheral blood-derived human dendritic cells (DC). The infection of DC with HHV-6 A or B was nonproductive, as revealed by calibrated real-time PCR measuring the accumulation of viral genome equivalents over time. Nevertheless, preexposure to HHV-6 markedly impaired the maturation of DC driven by <e>gamma interferon</e> and lipopolysaccharide, as shown by the reduced surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, HLA-DR, CD40, and CD80. Moreover, HHV-6, but not the closely related betaherpesvirus HHV-7, dramatically suppressed the secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12) p70 by DC, while the production of other cytokines that influence DC maturation, i.e., IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, was not significantly modified. Likewise, the secretion of the CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta and RANTES was unaltered. Functionally, a pretreatment with HHV-6 impaired the ability of DC to stimulate allogeneic T-cell proliferation. Altogether, these data identify interference with the functional maturation of DC as a potential mechanism of HHV-6-mediated immunosuppression.",M1
15529863,"[Antiviral activity of human recombinant <e>gamma-interferon</e> and recombinant hybrid protein of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-thymosin-alpha1 on models of herpes-virus and cytomegalovirus infection in vitro]The conducted studies showed a certain efficiency of gene-engineering preparation of IFN-gamma and TNF-T in virus infections caused by herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in cell cultures of human embryo fibroblast (HEF). The drugs have no viricidal action. IFN-gamma, when used according to the treatment scheme in vitro, proved to be more effective versus TMF-T both in HSV-2 and in CMV. It inhibited significantly the HSV-2 reproduction within the dilution range of 1:50 to 1:500. It was also effective, when used in CMV, within the dilution range of 1:5000 and lower, whereas TNF-T was effective within the range of 1:500 and lower as well as in 0.1 multiple infection. A significantly higher effect was ensured when the drugs were used for prevention. In HSV-2, IFN-gamma inhibited the virus reproduction, like in the treatment scheme, within the dilution range of 1:50 to 1:500, whereas TNF-T was effective in the range of 1:50. In CMV, the drugs' effect, when used for prevention, was similar to that observed in the treatment scheme. The highest inhibition values were registered for HSV-2, when it was used 24 hours before infection (IFN-gamma--2.25 Ig, dilution range of 1:50; TNF-2--1.0 Ig, dilution range of 1:50). IFN-gamma and TNF-2 exert a synergic action on different stages of virus reproduction. A reliable additive effect was ensured in prevention made 4 hour before infection by IFN-gamma and TNF-T only in experimental CMV infection.",M1
15215126,"Effect of a combination of clevudine and emtricitabine with adenovirus-mediated delivery of <e>gamma interferon</e> in the woodchuck model of hepatitis B virus infection.Our aim was to evaluate the antiviral effect of a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, emtricitabine (FTC) and clevudine (L-FMAU), with the addition of an adenovirus-driven delivery of recombinant gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in the woodchuck model of hepatitis B virus infection. Six woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV)-infected woodchucks received L-FMAU (10 mg/kg) plus FTC (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 8 weeks; six other animals received in addition an intravenous injection of a recombinant adenovirus vector expressing woodchuck IFN-gamma (Ad-IFN) at weeks 4 and 8. In the control group, two animals received Ad-IFN alone, two received adenovirus vector expressing the green fluorescent protein reporter gene, and one remained untreated. In less than 2 weeks, all woodchucks that received L-FMAU plus FTC showed a rapid and marked inhibition of viral replication, with a 4-log(10) drop in serum WHV DNA. In two animals, viremia remained suppressed for several months after the end of treatment. Similarly, a dramatic decrease in intrahepatic replicative intermediates of viral DNA was observed in the L-FMAU/FTC-treated groups. The additional administration of Ad-IFN led to increased inflammation in the liver but did not enhance the antiviral effect of the L-FMAU/FTC combination. In conclusion, therapies combining L-FMAU and FTC in WHV-infected woodchucks resulted in a potent and sustained antihepadnaviral effect both in the liver and in the blood circulation. However, no extra benefit of adding IFN-gamma gene transduction to the L-FMAU/FTC combination could be detected.",M1
15102828,"Porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells induce Streptococcus suis bacteriostasis in vitro.The involvement of the choroid plexus in host defense during bacterial meningitis is unclear. Aiming to elucidate possible antibacterial mechanisms, we stimulated primary porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells (pCPEC) with proinflammatory cytokines and challenged them with various Streptococcus suis strains. In the supernatant of <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma)-stimulated pCPEC, streptococcal growth was markedly suppressed. Costimulation with tumor necrosis factor alpha enhanced this bacteriostatic effect, while supplementation of L-tryptophan completely eliminated it. We also demonstrate that an activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in the pCPEC seems to be responsible for the IFN-gamma-induced bacteriostasis. This supports the hypothesis of an active role of the choroid plexus in host defense against bacterial meningitis.",M1
15102758,"Inhibition of monocytic interleukin-12 production by Candida albicans via selective activation of ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase.Our previous data demonstrated that live Candida albicans inhibits interleukin-12 (IL-12) production by human monocytes. Here we explored whether C. albicans inhibits IL-12 via a released factor and whether the inhibition is mediated via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) regulation. Supernatant fluids were obtained from cultured C. albicans (SC5314) as well as cultured Saccharomyces cerevisiae after 20 h of incubation. At 2 h postincubation of monocytes with heat-killed C. albicans (HKCA) (2:1) to stimulate IL-12, concentrated fungal supernatant fluids were added and incubated for an additional 20 h. The present data show that, unlike supernatant fluids obtained from S. cerevisiae, the C. albicans supernatant fluids significantly suppressed IL-12 production induced by HKCA. This suggested that the inhibition is Candida specific. A preliminary biochemical analysis revealed that this secretory IL-12 inhibitory factor is glycoprotein in nature. The inhibitory activity had no effect on the phagocytosis of yeasts. Supernatant fluids from C. albicans markedly induced the phosphorylation of ERK44/42 MAPK, but not p38 and SAPK, 1 min after they were added to monocytes. To test if the induction of ERK44/42 MAPK was central to the IL-12 inhibition, we used <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) (1 ng/ml) plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml) to stimulate IL-12 production by monocytes. The inhibition of ERK MAPK by the specific inhibitor PD 98059 significantly reduced phospho-ERK44/42 MAPK levels induced by C. albicans supernatant fluids in the IFN-gamma-plus-LPS-driven monocytes. Concomitantly, PD 98059 reversed the IL-12 inhibitory activity of the C. albicans supernatant (P &lt; 0.01). These data indicate that C. albicans can inhibit IL-12 production by secreting an ERK44/42 MAPK-stimulating factor and thus can attenuate effective immune responses.",M1
14977950,"Bordetella pertussis infection of primary human monocytes alters HLA-DR expression.Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of whooping cough, a potentially lethal respiratory disease in children. In immunocompetent individuals, B. pertussis infection elicits an effective adaptive immune response driven by activated CD4(+) T cells. However, live B. pertussis persists in the host for 3 to 4 weeks prior to clearance. Thus, B. pertussis appears to have evolved short-term mechanisms for immune system evasion. We investigated the effects of B. pertussis wild-type strain BP338 on antigen presentation in primary human monocytes. BP338 infection reduced cell surface expression of HLA-DR and CD86 but not that of major histocompatibility complex class I proteins. This change in cell surface HLA-DR expression reflected intracellular redistribution of HLA-DR. The proportion of peptide-loaded molecules was unchanged in infected cells, suggesting that intracellular retention occurred after peptide loading. Although B. pertussis infection of monocytes induced rapid and robust expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10), HLA-DR redistribution did not appear to be explained by increased IL-10 levels. BP338-infected monocytes exhibited reduced synthesis of HLA-DR dimers. Interestingly, those HLA-DR proteins that were generated appeared to be longer-lived than HLA-DR in uninfected monocytes. BP338 infection also prevented <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) induction of HLA-DR protein synthesis. Using mutant strains of B. pertussis, we found that reduction in HLA-DR surface expression was due in part to the presence of pertussis toxin whereas the inhibition of IFN-gamma induction of HLA-DR could not be linked to any of the virulence factors tested. These data demonstrate that B. pertussis utilizes several mechanisms to modulate HLA-DR expression.",M1
14977928,"Aerosolized <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) induces expression of the genes encoding the IFN-gamma-inducible 10-kilodalton protein but not inducible nitric oxide synthase in the lung during tuberculosis.Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is critical in the immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In an ongoing trial of aerosol IFN-gamma in conjunction with standard drug therapy, we have observed activation of IFN signaling in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from tuberculosis (TB) patients. We hypothesized that aerosol IFN-gamma treatment of pulmonary TB would increase expression of genes important for the control of TB. We investigated the expression of downstream genes by measuring inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the chemokine IFN-inducible 10-kDa protein (IP-10) by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. In vitro, M. tuberculosis induced IP-10, and IFN-gamma stimulated this further, with no effect on iNOS expression. We studied 21 patients with pulmonary TB and 7 healthy subjects. Similar to the in vitro model, IP-10 mRNA was increased in BAL cells from TB patients and was augmented after treatment with aerosolized IFN-gamma. TB was also associated with elevated iNOS mRNA, but aerosolized IFN-gamma did not further enhance expression. Genomic analysis identified 1,300 of 4,058 genes expressed in BAL cells from six TB patients before and after 1 month of therapy, including aerosolized IFN-gamma. However, only 15 genes were differentially regulated by IFN-gamma. We conclude that iNOS and IP-10 mRNA expression is increased in TB but that aerosol IFN-gamma treatment increases expression of few genes in the human lung.",M1
14872115,"Interferon gamma-1b as therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An intrapatient analysis.BACKGROUND: The only proven therapeutic option for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is lung transplantation. It is biologically plausible that interferon gamma-1b (G-IFN) may halt or even reverse the disease process and therefore prove to be an effective medical therapy. We report our results using this medication in a cohort of patients with a wide range of severity of IPF. OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of G-IFN therapy on the progression of disease in patients with IPF. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients' pulmonary function tests (PFTs), specifically the forced vital capacity (FVC) and the single breath diffusing capacity for carbon dioxide (DLCO). Comparisons of these parameters prior to and after the implementation of therapy were made by generating regression slopes by least-squares equations. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients qualified for the analysis. For the FVC, comparison of pre- and post-therapy best-fit regression lines demonstrated a significant difference in favor of G-IFN (p&lt;0.015). For the DLCO, a significant difference in favor of <e>gamma interferon</e> therapy was detected in the advanced group (p&lt;0.03). Seventy percent of the patients showed either stabilization or regression of disease in both their FVCs and their DLCO. CONCLUSION: G-IFN appears to be an effective new therapy for patients with IPF. Salutary effects on the rate of change in the FVC and DLCO were most apparent in patients with advanced disease. With slowing or reversal in loss of lung function, G-IFN may improve longevity and may have utility as a bridge to lung transplantation in those patients who are appropriate candidates.",M1
14670450,"Study of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in paracoccidioidomycosis: cytopathology and alveolar macrophage function in response to <e>gamma interferon</e>; comparison with blood monocytes.Patients with paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) present marked involvement of the lungs during the course of the mycosis. The purpose of this work was to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from these patients to study the cytopathology, TNF levels and the oxidative and fungicidal response of alveolar macrophages (AMs) to in vitro incubation with recombinant IFN-gamma. To compare the lung and blood compartments, these determinations were also made in plasma and blood monocytes (BMs) obtained from the same patients. The cytopathology of BAL fluid revealed a predominance of macrophages, but with the presence of neutrophil exudation, and rare lymphocytes and epithelioid and giant cells. Comparison of the oxidative status and fungicidal activity of AMs and circulating BMs demonstrated that both cell types are highly activated for these two functions when compared to control cells. However, TNF levels were higher in BAL fluid than in plasma. The possible mechanisms involved in the hyperresponsiveness of cells from PCM patients are discussed.",M1
14643639,"IFN-gamma induced persistent Chlamydia pneumoniae infection in HL and Mono Mac 6 cells: characterization by real-time quantitative PCR and culture.Growth of Chlamydia pneumoniae during <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) induced persistent infection in epithelial (HL) and monocyte-macrophage (Mono Mac 6) cell lines was studied by a quantitative real-time PCR and passage. When HL cultures were treated with IFN-gamma (25 U/ml), the replication of C. pneumoniae DNA was unaffected while differentiation into infectious elementary bodies (EB) was strongly inhibited, and in contrast to the untreated cultures, no second cycle of infection was observed. The estimated doubling time of C. pneumoniae genomes was 6-7 h in both IFN-gamma treated and untreated HL cultures. At 72 h post inoculation, most infectious EBs were released from untreated cultures, whereas in IFN-gamma treated HL cells &gt;90% of C. pneumoniae genomes were in non-infectious form. A higher dose (1000 U/ml) of IFN-gamma was needed to restrict growth of C. pneumoniae in Mono Mac 6 cells. In untreated Mono Mac 6 cultures, the growth curve of C. pneumoniae resembled that observed in HL cells, except that no second cycle of infection could be detected. In IFN-gamma treated Mono Mac 6 cultures, the number of infectious C. pneumoniae EBs recovered decreased gradually after 3 days post inoculation, while C. pneumoniae genome load remained unaltered suggesting persistence of C. pneumoniae also in these cells.",M1
12915556,"Edmonston measles virus prevents increased cell surface expression of peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex class II proteins in human peripheral monocytes.<e>Gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) induces expression of the gene products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), whereas IFN-alpha/beta can interfere with or suppress class II protein expression. In separate studies, measles virus (MV) was reported to induce IFN-alpha/beta and to up-regulate MHC class II proteins. In an attempt to resolve this paradox, we examined the surface expression of MHC class I and class II proteins in MV-infected peripheral monocytes in the presence and absence of IFN-alpha/beta. Infection of purified monocytes with Edmonston B MV resulted in an apparent increase in cell surface expression of HLA-A, -B, and -C class I proteins, but it had no effect on the expression of HLA-DR class II proteins. MV-infected purified monocytes expressed IFN-alpha/beta, but no measurable IFN-gamma expression was detected in supernatant fluids. Class II protein expression could be enhanced by coculture of purified monocytes with uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) supernatant. MV infection of PBMCs also did not affect expression of class II proteins, but the expression of HLA-A, -B, and -C class I proteins was increased two- to threefold in most donor cells. A direct role for IFN-alpha/beta suppression of MHC class II protein expression was not evident in monocytes since MV suppressed class II protein expression in the absence of IFN-alpha/beta. Taken together, these data suggest that MV interferes with the expression of peptide-loaded class II complexes, an effect that may potentially alter CD4(+)-T-cell proliferation and the cell-mediated immune responses that they help to regulate.",M1
12890997,"Vigilin and enzyme expression in isolated pancreatic acini after mellitin and <e>gamma-interferon</e> treatment.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pancreatitis goes along with changes in exocrine enzyme synthesis and secretion in pancreatic acini. The multi-KH domain protein vigilin is supposed to play an important role in t-RNA trafficking especially in cells with high protein synthesis rates and may reflect the degree of stimulation of translational machinery during pathological processes. In relation to these phenomena we explored in this connection the impact of two different inflammation mediators in a system of isolated rat pancreatic acini. METHODS: Acini were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats by collagenase digestion and incubated with mellitin or gamma interferon. Secretion and cytosolic cell content of pancreatic trypsin and amylase as well as the expression of vigilin were determined. RESULTS: The phospholipase A(2) activator mellitin caused morphological alterations and increased release of trypsin and amylase, while vigilin expression and the intracellular content of these enzymes decreased. Gamma-interferon, a cytokine which is involved at different steps in inflammation processes, selectively inhibits the release of trypsin(ogen) while not affecting amylase secretion and vigilin expression. CONCLUSION: Mellitin as well as gamma interferon causes alterations in pancreatic enzyme secretion. Additionally, mellitin seems to influence the expressed gene pattern of pancreatic acini while interferon-gamma has no effect on protein synthesis but enzyme secretion.",M1
12874355,"Induction of antimicrobial pathways during early-phase immune response to Salmonella spp. in murine macrophages: <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) and upregulation of IFN-gamma receptor alpha expression are required for NADPH phagocytic oxidase gp91-stimulated oxidative burst and control of virulent Salmonella spp.The effect of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) on elevation of reactive oxygen species and the viability of virulent wild-type and avirulent mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and S. enterica serovar Infantis was studied in a murine macrophage cell line (J774.2 cells). S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028 phoP and a rough lipopolysaccharide mutant of S. enterica serovar Infantis 1326/28 (phi(r)) (avirulent mutants) induced NADPH phagocytic oxidase gp91 (gp91(phox)) activity and a significant (P &lt; 0.05) elevation of reactive oxygen species within 12 h without coculture with IFN-gamma. This coincided with reduced survival of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium14028 phoP or stasis of S. enterica serovar Infantis phi(r). Fluorometric studies indicated that expression of IFN-gamma on infected J774.2 cells was not significantly (P &gt; 0.05) elevated. However, studies with the virulent S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains showed that a comparable level of control of bacterial numbers could only be achieved by coculture with IFN-gamma. This coincided with significant upregulation of IFN-gamma receptor alpha expression on the surface of J774.2 cells and was completely abolished by N-acetyl-L-cysteine captopril (an inhibitor of reactive oxygen species). Delay in reactive oxygen species induction due to a requirement for IFN-gamma and upregulation of IFN-gamma receptor alpha in macrophages infected with virulent salmonellae may result in greater dissemination of virulent salmonellae in host tissue.",M1
12874315,"Transfected Plasmodium knowlesi produces bioactive host <e>gamma interferon</e>: a new perspective for modulating immune responses to malaria parasites.Transgenic pathogenic microorganisms expressing host cytokines such as gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) have been shown to manipulate host-pathogen interaction, leading to immunomodulation and enhanced protection. Expression of host cytokines in malaria parasites offers the opportunity to investigate the potential of an immunomodulatory approach by generating immunopotentiated parasites. Using the primate malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi, we explored the conditions for expressing host cytokines in malaria parasites. P. knowlesi parasites transfected with DNA constructs for expressing rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) IFN-gamma under the control of the heterologous P. berghei apical membrane antigen 1 promoter, produced bioactive IFN-gamma in a developmentally regulated manner. IFN-gamma expression had no marked effect on in vitro parasite development. Bioactivity of the parasite-produced IFN-gamma was shown through inhibition of virus cytopathic effect and confirmed by using M. mulatta peripheral blood cells in vitro. These data indicate for the first time that it is feasible to generate malaria parasites expressing bioactive host immunomodulatory cytokines. Furthermore, cytokine-expressing malaria parasites offer the opportunity to analyze cytokine-mediated modulation of malaria during the blood and liver stages of the infection.",M1
12743441,"Modulation of mucin synthesis by <e>gamma-interferon</e> in human colon adenocarcinoma cells.OBJECTIVES: Recombinant human interferon has been shown to enhance the expression of histocompatibility antigens and certain tumor-associated antigens in a variety of carcinoma cell lines. Since many tumor-associated antigens are mucins, we investigated the effect of recombinant human gamma-interferon on mucin production and secretion by colon cancer cell lines. METHODS: Control and gamma-interferon-treated cells were labeled with [(3)H]glucosamine in DMEM-H16 medium with 5% FCS for 24 h. Analysis was performed by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-4B columns, and the high-molecular-weight glycoprotein eluted at the void volume from the cytosol and medium was counted (expressed as dpm/4 x 10(6) cells). In another experiment the void volume was compared to concentration curves of standard mucins (expressed as mg/10(7) cells). RESULTS: gamma-Interferon increased mucin synthesis in HT-29 and LIM-6 cells, but not in LS174T and CACO2 cells. In HT-29 and LIM-6 cells, mucin synthesis was induced by gamma-interferon in a dose-dependent manner. The percentage of mucin secreted into the medium was also increased. CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of response of human colon cancer cell lines to gamma-interferon by mucin production may limit the specific role of gamma-interferon as a modulator of mucin-type tumor-associated antigens.",M1
12680603,"Development and validation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for recombinant human <e>gamma interferon</e>.A one-site ELISA for the quantification of recombinant human gamma interferon (rh-IFN-gamma) was developed and validated. A single monoclonal antibody (Mab) was used as a  catching  antibody and as a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled conjugate. Detection limit and quantification limit of this assay were estimated to be 1.26 and 15 ng/mL, respectively, and the coefficient of variation was below 15%. The ELISA was specific for rh-IFN-gamma, showing no cross reactivity to other related molecules in the range of the concentrations studied. The results correlated well with those obtained by a bioassay method. By using this assay, it was demonstrated that 0.01-1% (v/v) Tween 80 protected rh-IFN-gamma during freezing and thawing.",M1
12654826,"Recombinant <e>gamma interferon</e> stimulates signal transduction and gene expression in alveolar macrophages in vitro and in tuberculosis patients.Tuberculosis is the seventh leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, with eight million cases per year. Animal and human studies demonstrate an enrichment of CD4 cells at sites of disease, with a more favorable clinical course when there is a Th1 response with the presence of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). We previously treated patients who had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis with recombinant IFN-gamma (rIFN-gamma) in aerosol form and were able to convert smear-positive cases to smear negative with 12 treatments over 1 month. We hypothesized that rIFN-gamma would induce signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) binding activity in alveolar macrophages (AM). AM treated in vitro showed clear upregulation of STAT-1 and IRF-1 by rIFN-gamma. STAT-1 was not activated and IRF-1 was only weakly induced after 1 day of infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis TN913. In bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells obtained from 10 of 10 tuberculosis patients 10 +/- 2 days post-antituberculosis treatment, there was no detectable STAT-1 or IRF-1 DNA-binding activity. After 4 weeks of treatment with rIFN-gamma aerosol in addition to the antituberculosis drugs, 10 of 10 patients had increased STAT-1, IRF-1, and/or IRF-9 DNA-binding activity in BAL cells from lung segments shown radiographically to be involved and in those shown to be uninvolved. Symptoms and chest radiographs improved, and amounts of macrophage inflammatory cytokines and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral loads (in five of five HIV-1-coinfected patients) declined in the second BAL specimens. rIFN-gamma aerosol induces signal transduction and gene expression in BAL cells and should be evaluated for efficacy in a randomized, controlled clinical trial.",M1
12650768,"Effect of cytokines on the in vitro fungicidal activity of monocytes from paracoccidioidomycosis patients.Peripheral blood monocytes obtained from paracoccidioidomycosis patients and healthy individuals were preactivated with recombinant <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) in different concentrations (250, 500 and 1000 U/ml) and evaluated for fungicidal activity against Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis strain 18 (Pb 18, high-virulence strain) and strain 265 (Pb 265, low-virulence strain) by plating of cocultures and counting of colony-forming units, after 10 d. Monocytes from healthy individuals failed to present fungicidal activity against P. brasiliensis even after IFN-gamma activation at the three concentrations. However, patient monocytes activated with IFN-gamma (1000 U/ml) showed a significant fungicidal activity when compared to that obtained with non-activated or activated cells with other IFN-gamma concentrations (250 and 500 U/ml). Moreover, patient monocytes presented higher fungicidal activity than the control, even before the activation process. These results may be explained by the activation state of patients' cells as a function of the in vivo contact with the fungus, which was confirmed by their higher capacity to release H(2)O(2) in vitro. Unlike the results obtained with Pb 18, patient and control cells presented a significant fungicidal activity against Pb 265, after priming with IFN- gamma. These results are explained by the higher levels of TNF-alpha in supernatants of cultures challenged with Pb 265. Moreover, higher levels of the cytokine were obtained in patient cell supernatants. Taken together, our results suggest that for effective killing of P. brasiliensis by monocytes, an initial activation signal induced by IFN-gamma is necessary to stimulate the cells to produce TNF-alpha. This cytokine may be involved, through an autocrine pathway, in the final phase activation process. The effectiveness of this process seems to depend on the virulence of the fungal strain and the activation state of the challenged cells.",M1
12475556,"Light elements quantification in stimulated cells cryosections studied by electron probe microanalysis.The quantification of intracellular light elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen may be useful in understanding the biological mechanisms, for example the generation of nitric oxide which is involved in apoptosis and inflammatory reaction. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) coupled with scanning transmission electron microscopy is a useful method to detect light elements in thin cryosections. Recent developments of X-ray detectors with ultra-thin protection windows allows the detection of such elements by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. In the present study, we have demonstrated using both methods that the stimulation of BV-2 murine microglial cell line by <e>gamma-interferon</e> and lipopolysaccharide leads to the increase of intracellular oxygen concentration and no change in the intracellular nitrogen concentration. This indicates the use of exogeneous molecular oxygen in response to the stimulation.

12392063,"<e>Gamma interferon</e> directly inhibits the growth of neurofibroma cells in vitro.Various neurofibroma cell lines isolated from either dermal, plexiform, or diffuse neurofibromas were found to respond to human gamma interferon by decreasing proliferation rates in vitro. The cell number decreased to around 40-50% of controls (without gamma interferon) six days after the treatment. The cell lines showed dramatic inhibition of tritium-labeled thymidine uptake one day after the treatment with gamma interferon. Either 100 IU/ml or 1,000 IU/ml of gamma interferon resulted in the same range of inhibition. It is calculated that venous infusion of one vial of commercial recombinant gamma interferon (200 x 10(6) IU/ml) reaches more than 100 IU/ml in the peripheral blood, which means that it may be clinically useful. The cell lines also responded to gamma interferon by initiating expression of CD54. Immunological modulation of neurofibroma cell components by gamma interferon in vivo remains to be studied.",M1

The ability of <e>gamma interferon</e> and tumour necrosis factor alpha to induce antimycobacterial activity in bone-marrow-derived macrophages or the expression of the NRAMP1-mediated resistance to M. avium were not affected by the deficiency in p47(phox).

12228291,"Virulent Mycobacterium fortuitum restricts NO production by a <e>gamma interferon</e>-activated J774 cell line and phagosome-lysosome fusion.The virulence of different isolates of Mycobacterium has been associated with two morphologically distinguishable colonial variants: opaque (SmOp) and transparent (SmTr). In this report we used an in vitro assay to compare macrophage (Mphi) responses to SmOp and SmTr Mycobacterium fortuitum variants, taking advantage of the fact that these variants were derived from the same isolate. Cells preactivated or not with gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) were infected with SmOp or SmTr M. fortuitum. We showed that SmOp and SmTr induced different levels of nitric oxide (NO) production by IFN-gamma-stimulated Mphi. Indeed, the amount of IFN-gamma-induced NO production by J774 cells was 4.8 to 9.0 times higher by SmOp (23.1 to 37.7 micro M) compared to SmTr infection (3.9 to 4.8 micro M) (P = 0.0332), indicating that virulent SmTr bacilli restricted NO production. In addition, IFN-gamma-induced NO production by Mphi was higher when correlated with reduction of only avirulent SmOp bacillus viability. SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine)-induced NO production did not modify SmTr viability, indicating its resistance to nitrogen radicals. Electron microscopy studies were performed to evaluate the capacity of phagosomes to fuse with lysosomes labeled with bovine serum albumin-colloidal gold particles. By 24 h postinfection, 69% more phagosome-containing SmOp variant had fused with lysosomes compared to the SmTr-induced phagosomes. In conclusion, these data indicate that virulent SmTr bacilli may escape host defense by restricting IFN-gamma-induced NO production, resisting nitrogen toxic radicals, and limiting phagosome fusion with lysosomes.",M1
12183564,"Nitric oxide inhibits Coxiella burnetii replication and parasitophorous vacuole maturation.Nitric oxide is a recognized cytotoxic effector against facultative and obligate intracellular bacteria. This study examined the effect of nitric oxide produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) up-regulated in response to cytokine stimulation, or by a synthetic nitric oxide donor, on replication of obligately intracellular Coxiella burnetii in murine L-929 cells. Immunoblotting and nitrite assays revealed that C. burnetii infection of L-929 cells augments expression of iNOS up-regulated in response to <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Infection in the absence of cytokine stimulation did not result in demonstrable up-regulation of iNOS expression or in increased nitrite production. Nitrite production by cytokine-treated cells was significantly inhibited by the iNOS inhibitor S-methylisothiourea (SMT). Treatment of infected cells with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha or the synthetic nitric oxide donor 2,2'-(hydroxynitrosohydrazino)bis-ethanamine (DETA/NONOate) had a bacteriostatic effect on C. burnetii replication. Inhibition of replication was reversed upon addition of SMT to the culture medium of cytokine-treated cells. Microscopic analysis of infected cells revealed that nitric oxide (either cytokine induced or donor derived) inhibited formation of the mature (large) parasitophorous vacuole that is characteristic of C. burnetii infection of host cells. Instead, exposure of infected cells to nitric oxide resulted in the formation of multiple small, acidic vacuoles usually containing one C. burnetii cell. Removal of nitrosative stress resulted in the coalescence of small vacuoles to form a large vacuole harboring multiple C. burnetii cells. These experiments demonstrate that nitric oxide reversibly inhibits replication of C. burnetii and formation of the parasitophorous vacuole.",M1
12167712,"<e>Gamma interferon</e> and cadmium treatments modulate eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-dependent mRNA transport of cyclin D1 in a PML-dependent manner.The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), when dysregulated, transforms cells. A substantial fraction of eIF4E forms nuclear bodies that colocalize with those associated with the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML. Overexpression studies indicate that nuclear eIF4E promotes the transport of cyclin D1 mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and that PML is a key negative regulator of this function. Since previous studies used overexpression methods, the physiological relevance of eIF4E mRNA transport function or its interaction with PML remained unknown. Therefore, we monitored whether eIF4E-dependent transport could be modulated in response to environmental conditions. Here we report that cadmium treatment, which disperses PML nuclear bodies, leaves eIF4E bodies intact, leading to increased transport of cyclin D1 mRNA and increased cyclin D1 protein levels. Removal of cadmium allows PML to reassociate with eIF4E nuclear bodies, leading to decreased cyclin D1 transport and reduced cyclin D1 protein levels. In contrast, we show that treating cells with interferon increased the levels of PML protein at the PML-eIF4E nuclear body, leading to nuclear retention of cyclin D1 transcripts and reduced cyclin D1 protein levels. Neither interferon nor cadmium treatment altered cyclin D1 levels in PML(-/-) cells. Consistently, overexpression of a series of PML and eIF4E mutant proteins established that PML eIF4E interaction is required for the observed effects of cadmium and interferon treatment. The present study provides the first evidence that physiological factors modulate the mRNA transport functions of eIF4E and that this regulation is PML dependent.",M1
12069190,"CXC chemokine expression after stimulation with interferon-gamma in primary rat hepatocytes in culture.Monokine-induced by <e>gamma interferon</e> (MIG) and gamma-interferon-inducible protein (IP-10) are members of the CXC chemokine family that have been shown to be induced by interferon-gamma (IFNy) in some cell types. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether IFNgamma influences CXC chemokine production, particularly MIG and IP-10, in primary rat hepatocytes in culture. Previous experiments in our laboratory have demonstrated that pharmacologic doses of IFNgamma in an in vivo model of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion-induced liver injury resulted in increased hepatic levels of IP-10 and MIG and decreased hepatic levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-2, Kupffer cells, and epithelial neutrophil-activating protein, with a concomitant decrease in neutrophil-mediated hepatic injury. In the current investigation, MIG and IP-10 mRNA and protein were up-regulated in primary rat hepatocytes in vitro in response to IFNgamma. Although MIG and IP-10 mRNA were both somewhat increased at early time points, larger increases in these chemokines were seen at later time points, specifically at 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation as compared to controls. Levels of Kupffer cells and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 mRNA after IFNgamma were negligible and similar to those seen in controls. These findings were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis. These studies demonstrate that IFNgamma in vitro up-regulates the production of MIG and IP-10, at both the mRNA and protein levels.",M1
11909970,"Stat1-vitamin D receptor interactions antagonize 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D transcriptional activity and enhance stat1-mediated transcription.The cytokine <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) and the calcitropic steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) are activators of macrophage immune function. In sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and several granulomatoses, IFN-gamma induces 1,25D synthesis by macrophages and inhibits 1,25D induction of 24-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in 1,25D inactivation, causing high levels of 1,25D in serum and hypercalcemia. This study delineates IFN-gamma-1,25D cross talk in human monocytes-macrophages. Nuclear accumulation of Stat1 and vitamin D receptor (VDR) by IFN-gamma and 1,25D promotes protein-protein interactions between Stat1 and the DNA binding domain of the VDR. This prevents VDR-retinoid X receptor (RXR) binding to the vitamin D-responsive element, thus diverting the VDR from its normal genomic target on the 24-hydroxylase promoter and antagonizing 1,25D-VDR transactivation of this gene. In contrast, 1,25D enhances IFN-gamma action. Stat1-VDR interactions, by preventing Stat1 deactivation by tyrosine dephosphorylation, cooperate with IFN-gamma/Stat1-induced transcription. This novel 1,25D-IFN-gamma cross talk explains the pathogenesis of abnormal 1,25D homeostasis in granulomatous processes and provides new insights into 1,25D immunomodulatory properties.",M1
11835785,"[An experimental investigation of inhibition of interferon on lens epithelial cell growth in vitro]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the inhibition of alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) and <e>gamma-interferon</e> (gamma-IFN) on rabbit lens epithelial cell (RLEC) proliferation in vitro and their effective concentrations. METHODS: The second and third passage of RLEC were used for assay. Various concentrations of alpha-IFN or gamma-IFN were added into the culture medium and RLECs were exposed to these drugs. After 24 and 72 hours, the inhibition of RLECs was determined by counting the RLEC numbers on a counting plate and MTT colorimetric assay. RESULTS: Alpha-IFN and gamma-IFN may reduce the proliferation of RLECs at the concentration of 10(3) - 10(4) IU/ml. The inhibition of gamma-IFN was a little stronger than that of alpha-IFN. CONCLUSION: The experiment provides a scientific basis for selection of drugs to prevent after cataract.",M1
11819731,"Animal experiment and clinical study of effect of <e>gamma-interferon</e> on hepatic fibrosis.AIM: To evaluate the antifibrotic effect of different doses of recombinant human Gamma-Interferon (IFN-gamma) in two rat models of hepatic fibrosis, and to observe its effect on moderate chronic hepatitis B virus fibrosis. METHODS: Hepatic fibrosis was successfully induced in 150 and 196 rats by subcutaneous injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and intraperitoneal injection of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN), respectively. Each of the two model groups was divided into: (1) fibrotic model group; (2) colchicine treatment group (0.1 mg/kg/day, gastrogavage for 8 weeks); (3) high-dose IFN-gamma group (15 MU/kg per day, i.m. for 8 weeks); (4) medium-dose IFN-gamma group (5 MU/kg daily, i.m. for 8 weeks); and (5) Y low-dose IFN-gamma group (1.67 MU/kg daily, i.m. for 8 weeks). Another group of 10 rats without any treatment was used as normal controls. At the end of the experiment, semi-quantitative histopathological scores of inflammation and fibrosis, liver alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression level, liver hydroxyl proline content and serum hyaluronic acid levels were compared. And 47 medium chronic hepatitis B viral fibrosis patients were studied. They were given IFN-gamma treatment, 100 MU/day i.m. for the first three months and 100 MU qod i.m. for the next six months. Semi-quantitative pathological scores of inflammation and fibrosis and serum hepatic fibrosis indices were compared within the 9 months. RESULTS: In animal experiment, the pathological fibrosis scores and liver hydroxyl proline content were found to be significantly lower in rats treated with different doses of IFN-gamma as compared with rats in fibrotic model group induced by either CCl4 or DMN, in a dose-dependent manner. For CCl4-induced model, pathological fibrosis scores in high, medium and low doses IFN-gamma groups were 5.10 +/- 2.88, 7.70 +/- 3.53 and 8.00 +/- 3.30, respectively, but the score was 14.60 +/- 7.82 in fibrotic model group. Hydroxyl proline contents were 2.83 +/- 1.18, 3.59 +/- 1.22 and 4.80 +/- 1.62, in the three IFN-gamma groups, and 10.01 +/- 3.23 in fibrotic model group. The difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.01). Similar results were found in DMN-induced model. Pathological fibrosis scores were 6.30 +/- 0.48, 8.10 +/- 2.72 and 8.30 +/- 2.58, in high, medium and low doses IFN-gamma groups, and 12.60 +/- 3.57 in fibrotic model group. Hydroxyl proline contents were 2.72 +/- 0.58, 3.14 +/- 0.71 and 3.62 +/- 1.02, in the three IFN-gamma groups, and 12.79 +/- 1.54 in fibrotic model group. The difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.01). Serum hepatic fibrosis indices decreased significantly in the 47 patients after IFN-gamma treatment (HA: 433.38 +/- 373.00 vs 281.57 +/- 220.48; LN: 161.22 +/- 41.02 vs 146 +/- 35 +/- 44. 67; PC III: 192.59 +/- 89.95 vs 156.98 +/- 49.22; C-I: 156.30 +/- 44.01 vs 139.14 +/- 34.47) and the differences between the four indices were significant (P &lt;0.05). Thirty-three patients received two liver biopsies, one before and one after IFN-gamma treatment. In thirty of 33 patients IFN-gamma had better effects according to semi-quantitative pathological scores (8.40 +/- 5.83 vs 5.30 +/- 4.05, P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: All the three doses of IFN-gamma are effective in treating rat liver fibrosis induced by either CCl4 or DMN, the higher the dose, the better the effect. And IFN-gamma is effective for patients with moderate chronic hepatitis B viral fibrosis.",M1

11500413,"Chlamydia pneumoniae expresses genes required for DNA replication but not cytokinesis during persistent infection of HEp-2 cells.Chlamydia pneumoniae causes community-acquired pneumonia and is associated with several chronic diseases, including asthma and atherosclerosis. The intracellular growth rate of C. pneumoniae slows dramatically during chronic infection, and such persistence leads to attenuated production of new elementary bodies, appearance of morphologically aberrant reticulate bodies, and altered expression of several chlamydial genes. We used an in vitro system to further characterize persistent C. pneumoniae infection, employing both ultrastructural and transcriptional activity measurements. HEp-2 cells were infected with C. pneumoniae (TW-183) at a multiplicity of infection of 3:1, and at 2 h postinfection <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) was added to the medium at 0.15 or 0.50 ng/ml. Treated and untreated cultures were harvested at several times postinfection. RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed, and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analyses targeting primary transcripts from chlamydial rRNA operons as well as dnaA, polA, mutS, minD, ftsK, and ftsW mRNA were done. Some cultures were fixed and stained for electron microscopic analysis, and a real-time PCR assay was used to assess relative chlamydial chromosome accumulation under each culture condition. The latter assays showed that bacterial chromosome copies accumulated severalfold during IFN-gamma treatment of infected HEp-2 cells, although less accumulation was observed in cells treated with the higher dose. Electron microscopy demonstrated that high-dose IFN-gamma treatment elicited aberrant forms of the bacterium. RT-PCR showed that chlamydial primary rRNA transcripts were present in all IFN-gamma-treated and untreated cell cultures, indicating bacterial metabolic activity. Transcripts from dnaA, polA, mutS, and minD, all of which encode products for bacterial chromosome replication and partition, were expressed in IFN-gamma-treated and untreated cells. In contrast, ftsK and ftsW, encoding products for bacterial cell division, were expressed in untreated cells, but expression was attenuated in cells treated with low-dose IFN-gamma and absent in cells given the high dose of cytokine. Thus, the development of persistence included production of transcripts for DNA replication-related, but not cell division-related, genes. These results provide new insight regarding molecular activities that accompany persistence of C. pneumoniae, as well as suggesting requirements for reactivation from persistent to productive growth.",M1
11473033,"Cytokine induction of Fas gene expression in insulin-producing cells requires the transcription factors NF-kappaB and C/EBP.Fas-mediated cell death may play a role in the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells in type 1 diabetes. beta-Cells do not express Fas under physiological conditions, but Fas mRNA and protein are induced in cytokine-exposed mouse and human islets, rendering the beta-cells susceptible to Fas ligand-induced apoptosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular regulation of Fas by cytokines in rat beta-cells and in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Fas mRNA expression was increased 15-fold in fluorescence-activated cell sorting-purified rat beta-cells exposed to interleukin (IL)-1beta, whereas <e>gamma-interferon</e> had no effect. Transfection experiments of rat Fas promoter-luciferase reporter constructs into purified rat beta-cells and RINm5F insulinoma cells identified an IL-1beta-responsive region between nucleotides -223 and -54. Inactivation of two adjacent NF-kappaB and C/EBP sites in this region abolished IL-1beta-induced Fas promoter activity in RINm5F cells. Binding of NF-kappaB and C/EBP factors to their respective sites was confirmed by gel shift assays. In cotransfection experiments, NF-kappaB p65 transactivated the Fas promoter. NF-kappaB p50 and C/EBPbeta overexpression had no effect by themselves on the Fas promoter activity, but when cotransfected with p65, each factor inhibited transactivation by p65. These results suggest a critical role for NF-kappaB and C/EBP factors in cytokine-regulation of Fas expression in insulin-producing cells.",M1
11326899,"[Study of antiproliferative effect of <e>gamma-interferon</e> and heparin on rabbit lens epithelial cell (RLEC) cultured in vitro]PURPOSE: To study the antiproliferative effect of gamma-interferon and heparin on rabbit lens epithelial cell(RLEC). METHODS: First passage RLEC was obtained from healthy New zealand white rabbits. Third passage cells were incubated with gamma-interferon with concentration from 0.1 u/ml to 10,000 u/ml and heparin with concentration from 100-5,000 u/ml for 48 hours. The Mosmann's MTT colorimeltric assay was used to quantitate the RLEC proliferative activation. RESULTS: In lower concentration groups (0.1-100 u/ml), gamma-interferon had no antiproliferative effect on RLEC, while in higher concentration groups (1,000 u/ml-10,000 u/ml) it exhibited some antiproliferative effect on RLEC, the rate of inhibition were 27% and 38%, respectively. Heparin of all experimental groups had antiproliferative effect on RLEC. CONCLUSION: gamma-interferon and heparin with certain concentration can inhibit proliferation of RLEC directly.",M1
11314045,"Control of cell cycle progression in human mesothelioma cells treated with <e>gamma interferon</e>.Recombinant human interferon gamma (r-hu-IFNgamma) exerts both antitumoral activity in the early stages of human malignant mesothelioma and a cytostatic effect in human mesothelioma (HM) cell lines in vitro. The antiproliferative effect of interferons (IFNs) reported in a variety of cells has been attributed to several mechanisms. In order to progress in the understanding of HM cell growth modulation by r-hu-IFNgamma, modifications of cell cycle progression and expression of key cell cycle regulator proteins in response to r-hu-IFNgamma were examined. Nine HM cell lines were studied, including one resistant to the antiproliferative effect of r-hu-IFNgamma. Except in the resistant cell line r-hu-IFNgamma produced an arrest in the G1 and G2-M phases of the cell cycle, associated with a reduction in both cyclin A and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) expression. Moreover cyclin B1/cdc2 activity was decreased. The present study provides the first evidence of a G2-arrest in r-hu-IFNgamma-treated HM cell lines and indicates that HM cell lines, despite their tumorigenic origin still support cell cycle control. The cell cycle arrest induced by r-hu-IFNgamma seems to depend on cyclin regulation through p21(WAF1/CIP1)- and p27(Kip1)-independent mechanisms and is not directly related to the induced DNA damage.",M1
11120943,"Activity of gatifloxacin alone or in combination with pyrimethamine or <e>gamma interferon</e> against Toxoplasma gondii.The activity of gatifloxacin against Toxoplasma gondii, either alone or in combination with pyrimethamine or gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), was examined in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, gatifloxacin significantly inhibited intracellular replication of tachyzoites of the RH strain with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.21 microg/ml at 48 h after addition of the drug to the cultures. Toxicity for host cells was not observed at this concentration. A synergistic effect (combination indices &lt; 0.5) was demonstrated in vitro following 48 h of treatment with the combination of gatifloxacin and pyrimethamine (1:1 ratio). Doses of gatifloxacin of 100 and 200 mg/kg of body weight/day administered orally to mice for 10 days resulted in significant (P values of 0.056 and &lt;0.0001, respectively) prolongation in time to death following infection with a lethal inoculum of tachyzoites. A dose of 400 mg/kg resulted in 20% survival (P = 0.0001). Mortality was 100% in untreated control mice and in mice treated with 25 or 50 mg/kg/day. Treatment of infected mice with a combination of gatifloxacin at 200 mg/kg/day and pyrimethamine at 12.5 mg/kg/day resulted in 85% survival, whereas 100 and 80% of mice treated with gatifloxacin alone or pyrimethamine alone, respectively, died (P &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, a gatifloxacin dose of 200 mg/kg/day administered orally for 10 days plus 2 microg of recombinant murine IFN-gamma/day administered intraperitoneally for 10 days resulted in significant survival compared with IFN-gamma alone (P &lt; 0.0001) or gatifloxacin alone (P &lt; 0.007).",M1

10909967,"Cytokines induce apoptosis in beta-cells isolated from mice lacking the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS-/-).Prolonged exposure of rodent beta-cells to combinations of cytokines induces the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and Fas expression, nitric oxide (NO) production, and cell death. It also induces the expression of potential  defense  genes, such as manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and heat shock protein (hsp) 70. NO is a radical with multifaceted actions. Recent studies have shown that NO, in addition to having cytotoxic actions, may regulate gene transcription. It remains unclear whether NO mediates cytokine-induced gene expression and subsequent beta-cell death. Previous studies using NO synthase blockers yielded conflicting results, which may be due to nonspecific effects of these agents. In this study, we examined the effects of cytokines on gene expression, determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and viability, determined by nuclear dyes, of pancreatic islets or fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)-purified beta-cells isolated from iNOS knockout mice (iNOS-/-, background C57BL/6x129SvEv) or their respective controls (C57BL/6x129SvEv). The combination of cytokines used was interleukin-1beta (50 U/ml) plus <e>gamma-interferon</e> (1,000 U/ml) plus tumor necrosis factor-alpha (1,000 U/ml). The lack of cytokine-induced iNOS activity in the iNOS-/- islet cells was confirmed by RT-PCR and nitrite determination. Cytokines induced a &gt;3-fold increase in Fas and MnSOD mRNA expression in wild-type (WT) and iNOS-/- islets. On the other hand, hsp 70 was induced in WT but not in iNOS-/- islets. Prolonged (6-9 days) exposure of WT islets to cytokines leads to an 80-90% decrease in islet cell viability, whereas viability decreased by only 10-30% in iNOS-/- islet cells. To determine the mode of cytokine-induced cell death, FACS-purified beta-cells were exposed to the same cytokines. After 9 days, the apoptosis index was similarly increased in WT (39 +/- 3%) and iNOS4-/- (33 +/- 4%) beta-cells. On the other hand, cytokines increased necrosis in WT (20 +/- 4%) but not in iNOS-/- (7 +/- 3%) beta-cells. From these data, we concluded that 1) NO is required for cytokine-induced hsp 70 mRNA expression but not for Fas and MnSOD expression, 2) cytokines induce both apoptosis and necrosis in mouse beta-cells, and 3) cytokine-induced apoptosis is mostly NO-independent, whereas necrosis requires NO formation.",M1
10858230,"Plasmodium chabaudi-infected erythrocytes adhere to CD36 and bind to microvascular endothelial cells in an organ-specific way.Adherence of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum to microvascular endothelial cells (sequestration) is considered to play an important role in parasite virulence and pathogenesis. However, the real importance of sequestration for infection and disease has never been fully assessed. The absence of an appropriate in vivo model for sequestration has been a major barrier. We have examined the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS in mice as a potential model. Erythrocytes infected with this parasite adhere in vitro to purified CD36, a critical endothelium receptor for binding P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. P. c. chabaudi-infected erythrocytes adhere in vitro to endothelial cells in a <e>gamma interferon</e>-dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of additional adhesion molecules in the binding process, as is also the case with P. falciparum-infected cells. Furthermore, plasma or sera from infected and hyperimmune mice, respectively, have the ability to block binding of infected erythrocytes to endothelial cells. In vivo, erythrocytes containing mature P. c. chabaudi parasites are sequestered from the peripheral circulation. Sequestration is organ specific, occurring primarily in the liver, although intimate contact between infected erythrocytes and endothelial cells is also observed in the spleen and brain. The results are discussed in the context of the use of this model to study (i) the relationship between endothelial cell activation and the level of sequestration and (ii) the primary function of sequestration in malaria infection.",M1
10729136,"Inhibitory effects of nitric oxide and <e>gamma interferon</e> on in vitro and in vivo replication of Marek's disease virus.The replication of Marek's disease herpesvirus (MDV) and herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cultures was inhibited by the addition of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, a nitric oxide (NO)-generating compound, in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of CEF culture, prepared from 11-day-old embryos, with recombinant chicken gamma interferon (rChIFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in production of NO which was suppressed by the addition of N(G)-monomethyl L-arginine (NMMA), an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Incubation of CEF cultures for 72 h prior to treatment with rChIFN-gamma plus LPS was required for optimal NO production. Significant differences in NO production were observed in CEF derived from MDV-resistant N2a (major histocompatibility complex [MHC], B(21)B(21)) and MDV-susceptible S(13) (MHC, B(13)B(13)) and P2a (MHC, B(19)B(19)) chickens. N2a-derived CEF produced NO earlier and at higher levels than CEF from the other two lines. The lowest production of NO was detected in P2a-derived CEF. NO production in chicken splenocyte cultures followed a similar pattern, with the highest levels of NO produced in cultures from N2a chickens and the lowest levels produced in cultures from P2a chickens. Replication of MDV and HVT was significantly inhibited in CEF cultures treated with rChIFN-gamma plus LPS and producing NO. The addition of NMMA to CEF treated with rChIFN-gamma plus LPS reduced the inhibition. MDV infection of chickens treated with S-methylisothiourea, an inhibitor of iNOS, resulted in increased virus load compared to nontreated chickens. These results suggest that NO may play an important role in control of MDV replication in vivo.",M1
10618269,"Opsonization and phagocytosis of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites measured by flow cytometry.A flow cytometric phagocytosis assay was established to investigate the role of anti-merozoite antibody, complement, and cytokines on the phagocytosis of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites by human neutrophils. This assay involved allowing fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled merozoites to interact with phagocytes and analysis of the cells on a FACScan with Lysis II software. To differentiate the proportion of neutrophil surface-bound merozoites from the merozoites ingested by neutrophils, the fluorescence of bound merozoites was quenched by adding trypan blue. The data showed that sera from malaria-immune individuals in the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea promoted merozoite engulfment by neutrophils. The cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, <e>gamma interferon</e>, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-1beta significantly increased the amount and the rate of merozoite phagocytosis by neutrophils. Optimum merozoite phagocytosis occurred when both cytokines and anti-malarial antibody were present.",M1
10603407,"In vitro Brucella suis infection prevents the programmed cell death of human monocytic cells.During the complex interaction between an infectious agent and a host organism, the pathogen can interfere with the host cell's programmed death to its own benefit. Induction or prevention of host cell apoptosis appears to be a critical step for determining the infection outcome. Members of the gram-negative bacterial genus Brucella are intracellular pathogens which preferentially invade monocytic cells and develop within these cells. We investigated the effect of Brucella suis infection on apoptosis of human monocytic phagocytes. The present study provides evidence that Brucella infection inhibited spontaneously occurring apoptosis in human monocytes. Prevention of monocyte apoptosis was not mediated by Brucella lipopolysaccharide and required bacterial survival within infected cells. Both invaded and noninvaded cells were protected, indicating that soluble mediators released during infection were involved in the phenomenon. Analysis of Brucella-infected monocytes revealed specific overexpression of the A1 gene, a member of the bcl-2 family implicated in the survival of hematopoietic cells. Brucella infection also rendered macrophage-like cells resistant to Fas ligand- or <e>gamma interferon</e>-induced apoptosis, suggesting that Brucella infection protected host cells from several cytotoxic processes occurring at different steps of the immune response. The present data clearly show that Brucella suis modulated the monocyte/macrophage's apoptotic response to the advantage of the pathogen, thus preventing host cell elimination. This might represent a strategy for Brucella development in infected hosts.",M1
10603396,"Effects of opsonization and <e>gamma interferon</e> on growth of Brucella melitensis 16M in mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro.Entry of opsonized pathogens into phagocytes may benefit or, paradoxically, harm the host. Opsonization may trigger antimicrobial mechanisms such as reactive oxygen or nitric oxide (NO) production but may also provide a safe haven for intracellular replication. Brucellae are natural intramacrophage pathogens of rodents, ruminants, dogs, marine mammals, and humans. We evaluated the role of opsonins in Brucella-macrophage interactions by challenging cultured murine peritoneal macrophages with Brucella melitensis 16M treated with complement- and/or antibody-rich serum. Mouse serum rich in antibody against Brucella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (aLPS) and human complement-rich serum (HCS) each enhanced the macrophage uptake of brucellae. Combinations of suboptimal levels of aLPS (0. 01%) and HCS (2%) synergistically enhanced uptake. The intracellular fate of ingested bacteria was evaluated with an optimal concentration of gentamicin (2 microg/ml) to control extracellular growth but not kill intracellular bacteria. Bacteria opsonized with aLPS and/or HCS grew equally well inside macrophages in the absence of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). Macrophage activation with IFN-gamma inhibited replication of both opsonized and nonopsonized brucellae but was less effective in inhibiting replication of nonopsonized bacteria. IFN-gamma treatment of macrophages with opsonized or nonopsonized bacteria enhanced NO production, which was blocked by N(G)-monomethyl L-arginine (MMLA), an NO synthesis inhibitor. MMLA also partially blocked IFN-gamma-mediated bacterial growth inhibition. These studies suggest that primary murine macrophages have limited ability to control infection with B. melitensis, even when activated by IFN-gamma in the presence of highly opsonic concentrations of antibody and complement. Additional cellular immune responses, e.g., those mediated by cytotoxic T cells, may play more important roles in the control of murine brucellosis.",M1
10498610,"Regulation of iron metabolism in murine J774 macrophages: role of nitric oxide-dependent and -independent pathways following activation with <e>gamma interferon</e> and lipopolysaccharide.To elucidate the pathways by which nitric oxide (NO) influences macrophage iron metabolism, the uptake, release, and intracellular distribution of iron in the murine macrophage cell line J774 has been investigated, together with transferrin receptor (TfR) expression and iron-regulatory protein (IRP1 and IRP2) activity. Stimulation of macrophages with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) decreased Fe uptake from transferrin (Tf), and there was a concomitant downregulation of TfR expression. These effects were mediated by NO-dependent and NO-independent mechanisms. Addition of the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N-monomethyl arginine (NMMA) partially restored Fe uptake but either had no effect on or downregulated TfR expression, which suggests that NO by itself is able to affect iron availability. Analysis of the intracellular distribution of incorporated iron revealed that in IFN-gamma/LPS-activated macrophages there was a decreased amount and proportion of ferritin-bound iron and a compensatory increase in insoluble iron, which probably consists mainly of iron bound to intracellular organelles. Finally, although NO released by IFN-gamma/LPS-activated macrophages increased the iron-responsive element (IRE)-binding activity of both IRP1 and IRP2, IFN-gamma treatment decreased IRP2 activity in an NO-independent manner. This study demonstrates that the effect of IFN-gamma and/or LPS on macrophage iron metabolism is complex, and is not entirely due to either NO-or to IRP-mediated mechanisms. The overall effect is to decrease iron uptake, but not its utilization.",M1

IFN-gamma enhances neonatal leukocyte activation and movement. We proposed that IFN-gamma in conjunction with penicillin compared to penicillin therapy without IFN-gamma would increase survival from group B streptococcal sepsis in a neonatal rat model. Newborn rats were infected with 10(5) cfu of group B streptococci at 48-72 h of age and randomized to receive either serum albumin (controls), rat recombinant IFN-gamma, albumin and penicillin, or IFN-gamma and penicillin. Survival 120 h postinfection revealed: controls 5% (1/21); IFN-gamma 4% (1/24); penicillin 23% (5/22); and IFN-gamma plus penicillin 10% (2/21). Survival analysis with a lognormal parametric regression model revealed only the penicillin group to have improved survival compared to controls. Contrasting the penicillin group with the IFN-gamma plus penicillin group did not reveal a statistically significant difference by the Wald chi2 statistic (p = 0.25).",M1
10390188,"Inhibition of human erythroid colony formation by ceramide.In previous studies, we have demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-1 on human erythroid colony formation are indirect and mediated by beta and <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN), respectively, which act directly upon erythroid colony forming units (CFU-E). The in vitro inhibitory effect of gammaIFN but not betaIFN is reversed by exposure to high concentrations of recombinant human (rh) erythropoietin (EPO). Ceramide, a product of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, is a known mediator of apoptotic effects of TNF, IL-1, and gammaIFN. In this report, the effects of ceramide on CFU-E colony formation and its implication in the model described above are evaluated. Endogenous ceramide produced by exposure to bacterial sphingomyelinase (0.2-2.0 U/mL) and exogenous cell-permeable ceramide (C2-ceramide; 5 and 10 mM) significantly inhibited bone marrow CFU-E colony formation. This effect was reversed by the ceramide antagonist sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P). Inhibition of CFU-E by rhgammaIFN, but not rhbetaIFN, was significantly reversed by S-1-P. rhEPO 10 U/mL reversed CFU-E inhibition by C2-ceramide 10 mM. Exposure of marrow cells to rhgammaIFN led to a 57% increase in ceramide content. The present study demonstrates that colony formation by human CFU-E is inhibited by endogenous and exogenous ceramide, and that inhibition by rhgammaIFN can be reversed by the ceramide antagonist S-1-P. Inhibition of CFU-E colony formation by ceramide and by are both reversed by high concentrations of rhEPO. These findings strongly suggest that ceramide mediates inhibition of human CFU-E colony formation by gammaIFN.",M1

The cells were cultured in the presence or absence of recombinant gamma interferon (rIFN-gamma) and/or recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (rTNF-alpha) for 24 h and were then infected with either T. cruzi or T. gondii. Intracellular parasite replication was evaluated 24 or 48 h after infection. Treatment with rIFN-gamma and/or rTNF-alpha had no inhibitory effect on T. cruzi replication. In contrast, 54, 73, or 30% inhibition of T. gondii replication was observed in the cells treated with rIFN-gamma alone, rIFN-gamma plus rTNF-alpha, or TNF-alpha alone, respectively. The replication of T. gondii tachyzoites in cytokine-activated cells was restored by the addition of extra tryptophan to the culture medium. Similarly, T. gondii tachyzoites transfected with bacterial tryptophan synthase were not sensitive to the microbiostatic effect of rIFN-gamma. We also investigated the basis of the cytokine effect on parasite replication by using the three mutant cell lines B3, B9, and B10 derived from 2C4 and expressing defective STAT1alpha (signal transducer and activator of transcription), JAK2 (Janus family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases), or JAK1, respectively, three important elements of a signaling pathway triggered by rIFN-gamma. We found that rTNF-alpha was able to induce low levels expression of INDO mRNA in the parental cell line, as well as the cell line lacking functional JAK2. In contrast to the parental cell line (2C4), rIFN-gamma was not able to induce the expression of INDO mRNA or microbiostatic activity in any of the mutant cell lines. These findings indicate the essential requirement of the JAK/STAT pathway for the induction of high levels of INDO mRNA, tryptophan degradation, and the anti-Toxoplasma activity inside human nonprofessional phagocytic cells.",M1
10225828,"Recombinant human <e>gamma interferon</e> in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children: safety, CD4(+)-lymphocyte count, viral load, and neutrophil function (AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 211).Nineteen children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were treated with recombinant human gamma interferon (rIFN-gamma) (50 microg/m2 subcutaneously three times each week during weeks 1 through 12 and 100 microg/m2 subcutaneously three times each week during weeks 13 through 24) in a phase I/II clinical trial. All children continued to receive previously prescribed therapy with oral zidovudine or didanosine. Children were assessed clinically and with laboratory studies during 24 weeks of study treatment and for 12 weeks after completion of rIFN-gamma therapy. In general, rIFN-gamma therapy was well tolerated. There were two clinical or laboratory adverse events thought to be possibly or probably study drug associated. One child developed acute pancreatitis; another child developed granulocytopenia. Median CD4(+)-lymphocyte counts and plasma HIV RNA concentrations did not change significantly during therapy. In vitro neutrophil bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and superoxide production were not significantly affected by rIFN-gamma therapy. We conclude that rIFN-gamma therapy in HIV-infected children receiving single-agent antiretroviral therapy is safe and does not produce consistent changes in CD4(+)-lymphocyte count, plasma HIV RNA concentration, or in vitro neutrophil function.",M1
10210778,"Differential modulation of immune recognition molecules by interleukin-7 in human acute leukaemias.Clinical animal models and in vitro data afford evidence for anti-leukaemia immunity. Many reports have underlined the interest of interleukin-7 (IL-7) use in cancer and its pivotal role in immune recognition. This cytokine, initially identified as a B cell growth factor, enhances the anti-tumour properties of immune effector cells via T lymphocyte activation, increased specific cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. Nonetheless, few data are available regarding the effect of IL-7 on the expression at the leukaemia cell surface of molecules involved in the immune response, which defective expression could induce tolerance or anergy. This prompted us to study the effects of IL-7 on 20 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 9 cases of lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), in comparison with <e>gamma-interferon</e>, a potent inducer of immune regulation molecule expression. In AML and ALL, IL-7 increased MHC class I molecule expression, while class II molecules were weakly modified. The expression of the tumour necrosis factor family members CD40 and Fas/CD95, together with the adhesion molecules ICAM-1/CD54 and CD58/LFA-3, was also increased in both types of leukaemia. The IL-7 was an efficient inducer of B7-2/CD86 expression in AML and ALL, while increased expression of B7-1/CD80 was only observed in AML. In the corresponding, co-cultured T lymphocyte population, IL-7 more particularly increased B7-1/CD80 and CD58/LFA-3 expression. Finally, pre-incubation of leukaemic cells with IL-7 increased the proliferation of responding, normal allogenic T lymphocytes and their secretion of gamma-IFN and IL-2 in mixed the lymphocyte-tumour reaction. We concluded that IL-7 is efficient at increasing the membrane expression of molecules which are central for the development of the immune response, and at improving allogenic immune recognition. The clinical implications of such data require further in vivo investigation.",M1
9934363,"Mycobacterium lepraemurium, a well-adapted parasite of macrophages: I. Oxygen metabolites.We measured the release of reactive oxygen intermediaries [ROI (hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion)] by murine peritoneal macrophages challenged in vitro with Mycobacterium lepraemurium (MLM), complement-opsonized yeast, M. bovis BCG, M. phlei, or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). We found that except for MLM, all of the other materials provoked the release of significant amounts of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. MLM entered the macrophages without triggering their oxidative metabolism. Pre-infection of macrophages with MLM did not alter these cells' capacity to release the normal amounts of ROI in response to other microorganisms or PMA. Killing of MLM did not revert the macrophages' failure to release ROI upon ingestion of the microorganism, nor were macrophages able to produce these toxic metabolites when pre-incubated in the presence of murine <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma). MLM has several attributes that allow it to survive within macrophages: a) it is a nontoxigenic microorganism (it does not harm its host), b) it resists the harsh conditions of the intraphagolysosomal milieu (a property perhaps dependent on its thick lipidic envelope), and c) it penetrates the macrophages without triggering their oxidative response (thus avoiding the generation of the toxic intermediaries of oxygen). For these attributes (and others discussed in this paper), we recognize MLM as a highly evolved, well-adapted parasite of macrophages. In addition, the results of the present study prompted the analysis of the biochemical pathways used by MLM and M. bovis BCG to penetrate into their cellular hosts, a subject now under investigation in our laboratory.",M1
9825505,"[Anti-Trichomonas activity of metronidazole in the presence of immunobiological preparations]The minimal doses of metronidazole, capable of the irreversible immobilization of Trichomonas in the presence of one antiprotozoan preparation and after the addition of recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF), recombinant <e>gamma-interferon</e> and complex immunoglobulin preparation (CIP) into the culture medium, were determined on 4 T.vaginalis isolates, obtained on day 2 after the inoculation of material from the mucous membrane of the urogenital organs of patients (incubation at 37 degrees C). After 12-hour incubation of Trichomonas with immunobiological preparations their sensitivity to metronidazole increased 2-fold. After the simultaneous introduction of TNF, gamma-interferon and CIP into the culture medium, the sensitivity of Trichomonas to the action of metronidazole increased 5- to 7-fold. The introduction of an additional dose of TNF into the culture medium, but without CIP led to the preservation of the motility in a small number of these microorganisms. The use of human albumin instead of CIP at the same concentration (15 g/l) in the presence of TNF and gamma-interferon ensured the complete immobilization of Trichomonas in all isolates.",M1
9744032,"[Obtaining antibodies and development of an immunoassay for the detection of Escherichia coli proteins in preparations of human recombinant <e>gamma interferon</e>]The present paper refers to the obtainment of polyspecific antisera directed against Escherichia coli host strain used to produce recombinant human gamma interferon (rec. hum. gamma IFN). The antisera were obtained by the cascade immunization method. The animals (n = 3) were initially immunized with an E. coli protein preparation (EcPp) of the host strain obtained from a blank run which assures the absence of the rec. hum. gamma IFN protein. Afterwards, consecutive immunizations were carried out with the less immunogenic proteins. To obtain those proteins, EcPp is passed through a column containing antibodies purified from previous inoculations coupled to a gel matrix. In this way, the proteins that have not been recognized by the immune system in that moment (e.g. do not have their corresponding antibodies coupled to the column) are separated an used to reimmunize the animals. The analyses of the antisera by Western blotting show a progressive recognition of the host strain proteins by the antisera with the progression of the cascade method. The recognition is evident through all the molecular weight range. Those antisera were used as quality control of the recombinant protein, by quantification of the host strain protein contaminants using a multiantigenic ELISA. The detection limit of that system was 3.125 ng/mL and the quantification limit 6.25 ng/mL.",M1
9687151,"<e>Gamma-interferon</e> activates a nuclear protein that binds to the gamma-interferon activation site of the thyroglobulin gene.The release of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) has been demonstrated from the infiltrating T lymphocytes of the thyroid gland from patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). We have shown previously that IFNgamma inhibited thyroglobulin (Tg) gene transcription, and that its action was mediated by an increase in intracellular calcium and inositol phosphates. In the present study, we tried to determine the specific site of action of IFNgamma on the Tg gene. A 565 bp fragment (position -530 to +34) spanning the transcriptional start site of the human Tg promoter was ligated to the luciferase plasmid and transiently transfected into human thyrocytes. Stimulation with TSH (10 mIU/l) and IFNgamma (500 IU/l) resulted in a twofold increase and a 60% reduction in the luciferase activity respectively, similar to the effect observed with the endogenous Tg gene. Deletion studies revealed that the region with the strongest suppression by IFNgamma lay between 5' -388 to -258. Mobility gel shift experiments and DNA footprinting experiments demonstrated that the action of IFNgamma was mediated through a trans-acting protein which complexed to position -282 to -262 TTGAGCCTGTTCCCTC CAAA. Position -272 to -261 TTCCCTCCAA corresponded to the gamma-interferon activation site (GAS) consensus sequence TTNC(C)T NNNA. The turnover time of the nuclear protein lasted for only 4 h although the suppressive effect of IFNgamma on Tg gene transcription lasted for 48 h. The effect of IFNgamma was lost when the thyrocytes were co-treated with genistein, a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The presence of the GAS in the promoter sequence of the Tg gene confirms the specific action of IFNgamma in thyroid hormone metabolism. In conclusion, apart from its regulatory role in T cell development and perpetuation of the immune response in AITD, IFNgamma may also play a role in altering cellular function of the thyrocytes by its action on the Tg gene promoter.",M1
9669747,"<e>Gamma interferon</e> administration to patients with atopic dermatitis inhibits fibrinolysis and elevates C1 inhibitor.Recombinant human gamma interferon was used to treat 10 atopic dermatitis patients. Recombinant gamma interferon was administered weekly for three consecutive days at 50 microg/M2 SQ for four weeks. All patients' dermatitis improved with recombinant gamma interferon therapy and plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels rose with treatment. Recombinant gamma interferon treatment positively correlated with reduced total plasma fibrinolysis as measured by the fibrin lysis plate, plasmin-alpha2antiplasmin complexes, and tissue type plasminogen activator levels. Accordingly, plasminogen activator inhibitor levels increased. Treatment also was associated with a transient increase in thrombin-antithrombin III complexes. Recombinant gamma interferon resulted in a significant increase in C1 inhibitor antigen but not activity. Plasma prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen, and factor XII levels were not decreased. However, 5 of the 10 atopic dermatitis patients before therapy had circulating cleaved plasma high molecular weight kininogen detected on immunoblot, indicating prior kallikrein formation. The cleaved, circulating plasma high molecular weight kininogen disappeared in four out of the five original patients who were reexamined at one year after treatment. These combined data indicated that recombinant gamma interferon treatment reduced total plasma fibrinolysis. In untreated atopic dermatitis, circulating cleaved high molecular weight kininogen also may be a presenting manifestation.",M1
9612597,"The treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients with recombinant human <e>gamma interferon</e>.PURPOSE: Activity has been reported in phase II single-center, open-label studies after administration of low-dose recombinant interferon gamma-1b (rIFN-gamma) to patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, with an overall objective response proportion of around 15%. To confirm these data and define the complete response rate, we conducted a multicenter open-label trial in which 204 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma were treated with rIFN-gamma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and seven patients (134 males, 73 females, mean age 59) were enrolled, and 202 were evaluable. rIFN-gamma, 60: microgram/m2, was administered subcutaneously once every 7 days until disease progression. RESULTS: There were three (1.5%) complete responses and three (1.5%) partial responses, for an overall response proportion of 3% (95% CI: 1.2%, 6.7%). The median response duration was 13.3 months (range: 2 to 23 months). The median survival was 13.4 months (5.5 months to 29.2 months). Three (1%) deaths were observed during the course of study; they were considered to be related to progressive metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Toxicity was minimal, with 14% of patients experiencing grade 3/4 toxicity. The most frequent adverse events were chills (59%), fever (58%), asthenia (53%), nausea (29%), and headache (18%). Multivariate analysis revealed that younger age, higher performance status, higher hemoglobin, and lower LDH were predictive of survival. DISCUSSION: Recombinant interferon gamma 1b has only minimal efficacy in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Pretreatment variables associated with increased survival were male sex, higher Karnofsky performance status, higher hemoglobin, and low LDH.",M1
9574747,"Effects of <e>gamma-interferon</e> on keratocyte-induced collagen gel contraction and keratocyte proliferation.PURPOSE: Gamma-interferon has been shown to be an effective immunoregulatory polypeptide that can modulate fibroblastic response. We investigated the effects of gamma-interferon on keratocyte proliferation and keratocyte-induced collagen gel contraction. METHODS: Gamma-interferon in concentrations of 0.01, 1, 100, and 1000 U/ml of media was added to keratocytes embedded in polymerized type I collagen and the gel area was measured after 5 days with an image analysis system. The rate of keratocyte proliferation within and outside the collagen gel under the influence of gamma-interferon was also investigated. RESULTS: Keratocyte-induced collagen gel contraction was significantly inhibited at all concentrations above 0.01 U/ml. The keratocyte proliferation was not affected by low and moderate concentrations and was significantly stimulated at concentration of 1000 U/ml. CONCLUSION: Keratocyte-induced collagen gel contraction is inhibited by gamma-interferon and the mechanism of this effect is not inhibition of keratocyte proliferation by gamma-interferon.",M1
9573097,"Nitric oxide is produced by Cowdria ruminantium-infected bovine pulmonary endothelial cells in vitro and is stimulated by <e>gamma interferon</e>.Nitric oxide (NO) is a labile inorganic free radical produced by NO synthase from the substrate L-arginine in various cells and tissues including endothelial cells. A substantial elevation of nitrite levels indicative of NO production occurred in cultures of Cowdria ruminantium-infected bovine pulmonary endothelial cells (BPEC) incubated in medium alone. Exposure of the infected cultures to recombinant bovine gamma interferon (BorIFN-gamma) resulted in more rapid production of NO, reduced viability of C. ruminantium, and induction of endothelial cell death. Significant inhibition of NO production was noted after addition of the NO synthase inhibitor N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), indicating that the increase in production occurred via the inducible NO synthase pathway. Reduction in the infectivity of C. ruminantium elementary bodies (EBs) occurred in a dose-dependent manner after incubation with the NO donor molecule S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP) prior to infection of endothelial cells. The level of infection in cultures maintained in SNAP was reduced in a dose-dependent manner with significant negative correlation between the final level of infection on day 7 and the level of SNAP (r = -0.96). It was established that pretreatment and cultivation of C. ruminantium EBs with the NO donor molecule SNAP reduced infectivity to cultures and viability of EBs with the implication that release of NO in vivo following infection of endothelial cells may have an effect upon the multiplication of the agent in the host animal and may be involved in the pathogenesis of heartwater through the effect of this molecule upon circulation.",M1
9482903,"Induction of transporter associated with antigen processing by interferon gamma confers endothelial cell cytoprotection against natural killer-mediated lysis.T lymphocytes react minimally with nonactivated endothelial cells (ECs). However, natural killer (NK) lymphocyte interactions with resting ECs are rapid, avid, and result in endothelial activation and/or cytotoxicity. The molecular basis for these interactions and EC sensitivity to NK-mediated lysis is unclear. To address the EC-specific nature of NK sensitivity, we used syngeneic human umbilical vein ECs, dermal microvascular ECs, dermal fibroblasts, and B lymphoblastoid cell lines in calcein-AM retention NK assays with allogeneic NK effector cells and found the EC lines consistently more NK-sensitive. Because NK inhibitory receptors are engaged by membrane major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I molecules and MHC I-deficient targets are NK-sensitive, we investigated the quantitative levels of membrane MHC I on the panel of syngeneic lines. Highly sensitive ECs expressed similar (or higher) levels of membrane MHC I than their syngeneic NK-resistant counterparts. Pretreatment of ECs with <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) conferred protection against NK-mediated lysis, with much more rapid kinetics (2-6 hr) than those required for membrane MHC I hyperinduction (&gt;8 hr). These kinetics are consistent with induction of transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) expression and function. As opposed to NK-resistant cell lines, TAP-1 was undetectable in resting ECs. Recombinant expression of the TAP inactivator ICP47 by adenoviral-mediated transduction was used to selectively inhibit IFN-gamma-mediated EC TAP function. ICP47 expression abrogated EC cytoprotection conferred by IFN-gamma. We demonstrate a relationship between both basal and induced TAP-1 expression/function and EC sensitivity to NK-mediated cytotoxicity. We discuss the influence of an induced MHC I-associated peptide repertoire on vascular vulnerability to cytotoxic lymphocytes.",M1
9511750,"Melanoma differentiation associated gene-9, mda-9, is a human <e>gamma interferon</e> responsive gene.Subtraction hybridization using a cDNA library prepared from temporally spaced mRNAs from human melanoma cells treated with recombinant human fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) plus mezerein (MEZ) that induces terminal differentiation (tester cDNA library) and a temporally spaced cDNA library prepared from actively proliferating melanoma cells (driver cDNA library) produced a Temporally Spaced Subtracted (TSS) cDNA library. This approach resulted in the identification of melanoma differentiation associated (mda) genes displaying both enhanced and suppressed expression during growth inhibition and differentiation. In the present report, we describe a novel cDNA mda-9 that consists of 2084 nucleotides, and encodes a protein of 298 amino acids with a predicted M(r) of approx. 33 kDa. Treatment of human SV40-immortalized normal melanoma cells with immune interferon, INF-gamma, induces growth suppression and enhances mda-9 expression without inducing terminal differentiation. These results establish that induction of terminal differentiation in human melanoma cells, using the combination of a type I interferon (IFN-beta) + MEZ, can elicit signaling pathways and gene expression changes also regulated by type II immune interferon.",M1
9459619,"Clinical and biological effects of <e>gamma interferon</e> and the combination of gamma interferon and interleukin-2 after autologous bone marrow transplantation.Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) have shown synergistic immunomodulatory and anti-tumor effects in preclinical studies. The present study was designed to assess the effects of the combination of these cytokines after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Ten patients received rIFN-gamma alone and 13 patients the combination of rIFN-gamma + rIL-2. Patients received transplants because of lymphoma (10 patients), acute leukemia (3 patients) or solid tumors (10 patients). Immunotherapy was started at a median of 67 days after ABMT. All patients received either 5 x 10(6) (8 pts) or 10 x 10(6) IU/m2 (16 pts) rIFN-gamma by subcutaneous injection 3 times weekly for 14 weeks. rIL-2 therapy consisted of 5 cycles of continuous intravenous infusion of 12 x 10(6) IU/m2/day starting 1 week after administration of rIFN-gamma. In the rIFN-gamma group, toxicity was mild and some biological changes were seen (NK/LAK activation, increase of phagocytosis and of NBT reduction). The combination of rIFN-gamma with rIL-2 did not increase the usual rIL-2 toxicity. NK/LAK cytotoxicity was strongly activated after the first cycle of rIL-2 and was maintained until the end of therapy. Granulocyte chemotaxis was defective after cycle 1 but recovered thereafter. We conclude that the administration of rIFN-gamma + rIL-2 is feasible after ABMT. Our data suggest that the combination may have prolonged the immunologic activation provided by rIL-2 and some improvement of the deleterious effects of rIL-2 on granulocyte functions was achieved. Controlled studies are warranted to assess the impact of this strategy on biological response and patient outcome.",M1
9396860,"MICA, a new polymorphic HLA-related antigen, is expressed mainly by keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and monocytes.MICA is a new polymorphic gene in the HLA region expressed in epithelial cell lines and gastrointestinal epithelium. Little is yet known about the MICA protein, and the pattern of its expression by freshly isolated cells has not been established. In the present experiments, we used antibodies raised in rabbits against alpha1 and alpha2 domain-peptides to study the expression of MICA. By western blot and immunoprecipitation, we detected a band of 62 000 Mr in various cell lines (THP-1, U937, HeLa, A431, Raji, MOLT-4, and HUV-EC-C) and in freshly isolated keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and monocytes but not in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CD19+ cells (B lymphocytes). It was not possible to up-regulate the expression of MICA in different cells by stimulation with <e>gamma-interferon</e>, but the expression of MICA was induced in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cells. We confirmed that MICA is expressed at the cell surface by flow cytometry. Results of immunoprecipitation studies of beta2-microglobulin (beta2m)- or MICA-depleted, metabolically labeled HeLa cells indicated that MICA was not associated with beta2m. Although the function of MICA is still unknown, its restricted pattern of tissue expression, the fact that it is expressed on the cell surface, and its polymorphic nature suggest that this new molecule, encoded close to HLA class I, may play a role in the interaction between epithelial cells and cells of the immune system.",M1

9384304,"<e>Gamma interferon</e> prevents diabetes in the BB rat.The BB rat model of human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) spontaneously develops diabetes through an autoimmune process. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is thought to play an important pathogenic role. This study examined if IFN-gamma administration can, paradoxically, prevent diabetes in BB rats. Diabetes-prone BB rats were initially injected intraperitoneally with murine recombinant IFN-gamma (rIFN-gamma) at doses of 0.5 x 10(4) to 40 x 10(4) U three times a week for 6 weeks beginning at 35 days of age. The effects of altering the duration of treatment (2 to 6 weeks) and the age at which injections were initiated (45 through 65 days) were also assessed. rIFN-gamma administration prevented the development of diabetes in a dose-dependent manner. The optimal treatment condition resulted in a 9.1% incidence of diabetes versus a 90% incidence in control rats. This diabetes-sparing effect was long lasting and continued to 7 months of age. A 4- to 6-week course resulted in maximal inhibition. Treatment initiated as late as 55 days of age, when insulitis is already present, was effective in preventing diabetes. Islet inflammation was dramatically lower in rIFN-gamma- versus saline-injected rats (P &lt; 0.01). Total leukocyte count and subpopulations of peripheral mononuclear cells were unaltered by rIFN-gamma. In summary, rIFN-gamma paradoxically and potently prevents diabetes in BB rats in a dose-dependent fashion by inhibiting islet inflammation. This diabetes-sparing effect occurs even when injections are initiated after evidence of the diabetic process is already present.",M1

9234715,"Multiple control elements mediate activation of the murine and human interleukin 12 p40 promoters: evidence of functional synergy between C/EBP and Rel proteins.Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric cytokine whose activity is critical for T-helper 1 responses. The gene for the IL-12 p40 subunit is expressed in macrophages following induction by bacterial products, and its expression is augmented by <e>gamma interferon</e>. In this study, we performed a functional analysis of the murine and human p40 promoters in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Transcription from the murine p40 promoter was strongly induced by lipopolysaccharide and heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes (HKLM), but promoter activity was not enhanced by gamma interferon. Multiple cis-acting elements involved in activated transcription were identified through an extensive mutant analysis. The most critical element, whose activity is conserved in mice and humans, is located between positions -96 and -88 relative to the murine transcription start site. This element exhibits functional synergy with a previously described NF-kappaB half-site which interacts with Rel proteins. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that C/EBP proteins interact with the critical element, but in nuclear extracts, cooperative binding of C/EBP and Rel proteins to their respective sites was not observed. Interestingly, promoter activity was induced by HKLM in the presence of cycloheximide, consistent with induction by posttranslational mechanisms. The results suggest that C/EBP and Rel proteins play important roles in the activation of IL-12 p40 transcription by bacteria. However, many complex interactions will need to be clarified to fully understand p40 regulation.",M1
9169460,"Synergy between interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in transcriptional activation is mediated by cooperation between signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and nuclear factor kappaB.Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) cooperate to induce the expression of many gene products during inflammation. The present report demonstrates that a portion of this cooperativity is mediated by synergism between two distinct transcription factors: signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). IFNgamma and TNFalpha synergistically induce expression of mRNAs encoding interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1, Mig (monokine induced by <e>gamma-interferon</e>), and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) in normal but not STAT1-deficient mouse fibroblasts, indicating a requirement for STAT1. Transient transfection assays in fibroblasts using site-directed mutants of a 1.3-kilobase pair sequence of the IRF-1 gene promoter revealed that the synergy was dependent upon two sequence elements; a STAT binding element and a kappaB motif. Artificial constructs containing a single copy of both a STAT binding element and a kappaB motif linked to the herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter were able to mediate synergistic response to IFNgamma and TNFalpha; such response varied with both the relative spacing and the specific sequence of the regions between these two sites. Cooperatively responsive sequence constructs bound both STAT1alpha and NF-kappaB in nuclear extracts prepared from IFNgamma- and/or TNFalpha-stimulated fibroblasts, although binding of individual factors was not cooperative. Thus, the frequently observed synergy between IFNgamma and TNFalpha in promoting inflammatory response depends in part upon cooperation between STAT1alpha and NF-kappaB, which is most likely mediated by their independent interaction with one or more components of the basal transcription complex.",M1
9151824,"The purified myxoma virus <e>gamma interferon</e> receptor homolog M-T7 interacts with the heparin-binding domains of chemokines.The myxoma virus T7 protein M-T7 is a functional soluble gamma interferon receptor homolog that has previously been shown to bind gamma interferon and inhibit its antiviral activities in a species-specific manner, but gene knockout analysis has suggested a further role for M-T7 in blocking leukocyte influx into infected lesions. We purified M-T7 to apparent homogeneity and showed that M-T7 is an N-linked glycoprotein that appears to be a stable homotrimer with a molecular mass of approximately 113 kDa in solution. M-T7, in addition to forming inhibitory complexes with rabbit gamma interferon, was also shown to bind to human interleukin-8, a prototypic member of the chemokine superfamily. Moreover, M-T7 was able to interact promiscuously with all members of the CXC, CC, and C chemokine subfamilies tested. Binding of human RANTES to M-T7 can be competed by rabbit gamma interferon and also by cold RANTES competitor with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 900 nM. Although M-T7 retains binding to a number of interleukin-8 N-terminal (ELR) deletion mutants, binding to mutants containing deletions in the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of interleukin-8 is abrogated. Furthermore, heparin effectively competes the interaction of M-T7 with the chemokine RANTES but not with rabbit gamma interferon. We propose that this novel M-T7 interaction with members of the chemokine superfamily may be facilitated through the conserved heparin-binding domains found in a wide spectrum of chemokines and that M-T7 may function by modulating chemokine-glycosaminoglycan interactions in virus-infected tissues.",M1
9125559,"Effects of <e>gamma interferon</e> and nitric oxide on the interaction of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis with bovine monocytes.In this study, we examined the effects of recombinant bovine gamma interferon (rIFN-gamma) and nitric oxide (NO) on the interaction of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis with bovine monocytes. Monocytes pretreated with rIFN-gamma exhibited slightly increased phagocytosis of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and modest inhibition of the intracellular growth of this microorganism. The number of viable intracellular bacilli decreased earlier in rIFN-gamma-pretreated monocytes than in control monocytes. After infection with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, NO was not constitutively released, but NO release from infected monocytes was induced by treatment with rIFN-gamma or with rIFN-gamma and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Release of nitric oxide was inhibited by addition of N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine; however, inhibition of nitric oxide did not alter the pattern of intracellular survival of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in rIFN-gamma-treated bovine monocytes. Although chemically generated nitric oxide killed M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in a cell-free system in vitro, the amount of nitric oxide required was far greater than that released from infected monocytes stimulated with rIFN-gamma and LPS. Our data suggest that rIFN-gamma activates M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected bovine monocytes to release nitric oxide but only modestly increases antimycobacterial activity of monocytes against this organism. This may be due, in part, to the fact that the amount of nitric oxide produced by rIFN-gamma-activated bovine monocytes is insufficient to kill intracellular M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis bacilli in vitro.",M1
9139849,"Determination of tumor-related factors of influence on the uptake of the monoclonal antibody 323/A3 in experimental human ovarian cancer.The epithelial glycoprotein 40 (EGP40) is an important target in the clinic for radioimmunolocalization and monoclonal antibody (MAb)-mediated therapy of cancer. We determined which tumor-related factors (including antigen distribution and density, vascularization and perfusion) were involved in the uptake of the anti-EGP40 MAb 323/A3 in 4 different human ovarian cancer xenografts grown s.c. in nude mice. The reactivity pattern of 323/A3 in all xenografts in vitro was similar and showed a strong and homogeneous distribution of the EGP40 antigen. FMa xenografts, however, showed the highest uptake of 323/A3 in vivo, which was 5.5-, 6.2- and 10.0-fold higher than that in OVCAR-3, Ov.Pe and Ov.Sh xenografts, respectively. FMa xenografts contained 2.1- to 3.5-fold more antigen per gram protein when compared with the antigen content of the other xenografts. FMa and Ov.Sh xenografts demonstrated a better vascularization pattern, whereas Ov.Pe and OVCAR-3 xenografts were moderately to poorly vascularized. FMa xenografts were also better perfused, as was shown by a 1.6- to 1.8-fold higher uptake of the (99m)Tc-labeled blood flow marker hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO). The tumor uptake of the non-specific MAb E48 was 2.2- to 11.2-fold lower when compared with that of 323/A3, but the sequence of uptake was similar (FMa &gt; OVCAR-3 = Ov.Pe &gt; Ov.Sh), indicating the lowest extravasation of MAbs in Ov.Sh xenograft tissue. Since both the antigen content and the perfusion appeared to be important factors of influence on the tumor uptake of 323/A3, attempts were made to manipulate these determinants to improve the tumor uptake. Neither <e>gamma-interferon</e> nor 5-fluorouracil were able to increase EGP40 expression in human ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with the calcium-antagonist flunarizine did not result in an improved perfusion, although a slight increase in the initial tumor uptake of 323/A3 was observed in Ov.Sh-bearing mice. Our results illustrate the relative contribution of various tumor-related factors that determine the usefulness of a MAb for imaging and therapy of cancer.",M1
9137834,"Two pathways of the nitric oxide-induced cytotoxycal action.Nitric oxide is a diffusible messenger with multiple biological functions. We show here that NO-generating compound, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) induces apoptosis in human chondrocytes and causes necrosis-like cell death in human epithelial CaOv cell line. Pretreatment of chondrocytes with low-dose GSNO or with <e>gamma-interferon</e> enhances their tolerance to the second high-concentration GSNO exposure. On the contrary, in CaOv cells low-dose GSNO pretreatment diminishes the resistance and increases cytolysis at the second GSNO exposure. We conclude that human chondrocytes possess specific and inducible mechanism preventing cell killing by nitric oxide.",M1
9067284,"Identification of constitutive and <e>gamma-interferon</e>- and interleukin 4-regulated proteins in the human renal carcinoma cell line ACHN.The effects of IFN-gamma and interleukin 4 (IL-4) on cell proliferation and two-dimensional gel electrophoretic protein patterns of the human renal carcinoma cell line ACHN were studied. Treatment of the cells with IFN-gamma resulted in a 40-50% decrease in their proliferation. IL-4 treatment resulted in a 30-40% decrease. Treating cells with both cytokines had the same effect as with IFN-gamma alone, thus precluding a synergistic antiproliferative interaction of these two cytokines. To identify IL-4- and IFN-gamma-regulated proteins in ACHN, two-dimensional preparative gel electrophoresis was used, combined with either capillary electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography and either Edman or mass spectrometric sequencing. The following cytokine-induced proteins were identified: tropomyosin, heat shock protein 27, manganese superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase pi, and protein kinase C inhibitor I. Tropomyosin increased 2-fold when cells were treated with IFN-gamma. Levels of heat shock protein 27 increased 2-fold with IL-4, 3-fold with IFN-gamma, and 4-fold when the cytokines were used in combination. Manganese superoxide dismutase increased 3-fold with IFN-gamma but was unaffected by IL-4. Glutathione S-transferase pi increased 3-fold with IFN-gamma. Levels of protein kinase C inhibitor I increased greater than 3-fold with IL-4, 4-fold with IFN-gamma, and 7-fold when both cytokines were used. In addition, the following constitutive ACHN proteins were identified: copper zinc superoxide dismutase, 60S acidic ribosomal protein P2, and a second heat shock protein 27 isoform. These findings help define the biochemical modes of action of IFN-gamma and IL-4 and their potential in the biological therapy of renal cell carcinoma.",M1
9644184,"[Effect of human recombinant <e>gamma-interferon</e> on proliferative activity of human laryngeal cancer cell lines]The effect of human on PCNA expressions of HEP-2 lines was investigated using LSAB (Labelled streptacidin biotin method) with monoclonal antibody Ki-67 (anti-PCNA). The results showed that the PCNA expression which reflects the proliferative activity of cells was dependent on dose of rhu-IFN-gamma in HEP-2 cell lines. Thus, our data suggest that rhu-IFN-gamma might be useful in the treatment of laryngeal cancer because it provides effective cytostatic.",M1
9030094,"Differing regulation of major histocompatibility class II and adhesion molecules on human umbilical vein endothelial cells by serotonin.Major histocompatibility class II molecules (MHC class II), whose biosynthesis and expression by endothelial cells can be induced by <e>gamma-interferon</e> (IFN-gamma), play a major role in antigen recognition and subsequent cell-cell interactions involved in the initiation of immune responses. Adhesion molecules such as E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1), whose biosynthesis and membrane expression by endothelial cells is regulated by proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and TNF), are necessary for the attachment and subsequent extravasation of leukocytes into the surrounding tissue. In the present study, the effects of preformed inflammatory mediators (histamine and serotonin) on the induction and expression of MHC class II, E-selectin, and ICAM-1 molecules by human umbilical vein endothelial cells were examined. Serotonin but not histamine was found to significantly inhibit in a dose-response fashion the induction and expression of MHC class II molecules. Inhibition occurred when it was added 24 h before, at the same time (most effective), or 24 h after IFN-gamma stimulation. No enhancement or stimulation of MHC class II biosynthesis could be detected using moderate or low concentration of either histamine or serotonin alone. In contrast to MHC class II molecules, neither serotonin nor histamine blocked the induction and biosynthesis of E-selectin and ICAM-1 molecules as detected by specific H18/7 and RR1/1 monoclonal antibodies, respectively, using flow cytometry. These findings suggest that serotonin but not histamine can assist in regulating the induction and expression of MHC class II molecules. Failure to block biosynthesis of E-selectin and ICAM-1 induced by TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta indicates the inhibitory effect exerted by serotonin was selective in nature.",M1
9001223,"A JAK1/JAK2 chimera can sustain alpha and <e>gamma interferon</e> responses.Cell lines that are mutated in interferon (IFN) responses have been critical in establishing an essential role for the JAK family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in interferon signalling. Mutant gamma1A cells have previously been shown to be complemented by overexpression of JAK2. Here, it is shown that these cells carry a defect in, and can also be complemented by, the beta-subunit of the IFN-gamma receptor, consistent with the hypothesis that the mutation in these cells affects JAK2-receptor association. In contrast, mutant gamma2A cells lack detectable JAK2 mRNA and protein. By using gamma2A cells, the role of various domains and conserved tyrosine residues of JAK2 in IFN-gamma signalling was examined. Individual mutation of six conserved tyrosine residues, mutation of a potential phosphatase binding site, or mutation of the arginine residue in the proposed SH2-like domain had no apparent effect on signalling in response to IFN-gamma. Results with deletion mutants, however, indicated that association of JAK2 with the IFN-gammaR2 subunit requires the amino-terminal region but not the pseudokinase domain. Consistent with this, in chimeras with JAK1, the JAK2 amino-terminal region was required for receptor association and STAT1 activation. Conversely, a JAK1-JAK2 chimera with the amino-terminal domains of JAK1 linked to the pseudokinase and kinase domains of JAK2 is capable of reconstituting JAK-STAT signalling in response to IFN-alpha and -gamma in mutant U4C cells lacking JAK1. The specificity of the JAKs may therefore lie mainly in their structural interaction with different receptor and signalling proteins rather than in the substrate specificity of their kinase domains.",M1
15739424,"[Purification and behavior of recombinant human <e>gamma-interferon</e> on reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography]A high performance liquid chromatographic system is described for the purification to homogeneity of recombinant human gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) from the inclusion bodies produced in genetically transformed Escherichia Coli cells. Crude products of gamma-IFN obtained from typical preparative liquid chromatographic separation on Sephacryl S200 column was applied to analytical HPLC with RP-C18 column and eluted with convex gradient of 0-82% acetonitrile in 30 min followed by linear gradient of 82%-100% in 30 min. A constant level of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was maintained throughout the gradient process. The retention of gamma-IFN was investigated as a function of pH, temperature as well as concentration of salt in the mobile phase. For denatured and renatured gamma-IFN the chromatographic profiles were analyzed under various conditions. The retention time of renatured gamma-IFN was compared with that of denatured gamma-IFN and a significant difference in the retention time of profiles was observed. Both biological activities were reduced to different degree followed with incorrect disulfide bond gamma-IFN or oligomer gamma-IFN. The purified gamma-IFN has a specific activity about 6 x 10(6) units/mL. The eluats were assayed for identification of gamma-IFN using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA). Its molecular weight was 17.5 kD, as determined by SDS-PAGE. The results support that renatured sample with tR = 24.8 min and denatured one with tR = 30.1 min were identical protein with different conformation. The chromatographic behavior is explained by the change in net charge and polarity of gamma-IFN when the mobile phase condition and the conformation vary. The oligomer or incorrect disulfide bonds were formed during gamma-IFN renaturation and also the biological activity was found to be native conformation dependent.",M1
9195045,"Purification of an atypical bovine interferon induced in response to heat shock in bovine cultured cells. Characterization in comparison with the classical alpha, beta and <e>gamma interferon</e>.Heat-shock induced factor (HSIF) was excreted by bovine MDBK cells during their recovery period after a heat shock. This factor has the capacity to induce 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase activity, an enzyme generally by interferon treatment (J Biol Chem (1987) 262, 4806-4811). We have observed that an antiviral state was also produced in response to heat shock. HSIF was purified 10,000-fold and different techniques showed a copurification of both activities. Certain properties of HSIF were established, such as its molecular mass (45 kDa) and isoelectric point (6.8). This cytokine was acid-sensitive as IFN gamma (type II) and temperature labile contrarily to alpha, beta and gamma bovine IFN. Immunoprecipitation and comparative chromatography on lectines or polynucleotides established that HSIF was structurally different from the three classes of bovine IFN. Moreover, two-dimensional electrophoresis and comparative analysis of [35S] methionine-labeled proteins induced by HSIF alpha, beta or gamma bovine IFN showed that HSIF induces a specific set of proteins. Taken together, all these results strongly suggest that HSIF is a new atypical bovine interferon induced in response to heat shock.",M1
9084211,"Method for increasing the yield of properly folded recombinant human <e>gamma interferon</e> from inclusion bodies.A strategy is described for improved refolding and purification of recombinant human gamma interferon (rh-IFN gamma), which could warrant a higher yield and specific activity than reported previously. The optimal conditions of refolding are obtained by addition of a labilizing agent, L-arginine, in the refolding buffer. A 10-fold increase in the yield was observed with 0.5 M L-arginine, compared with renaturation in its absence. By varying renaturation parameters, the conditions that allow functional refolding of approximately 25-30% of the recombinant protein have been standardized. A simple process is also described for the purification of rh-IFN gamma. The purification involves a single-column chromatography on S-Sepharose, after refolding of rh-IFN gamma in arginine containing buffer. This procedure has consistently produced rh-IFN gamma having a purity of at least 97%, the rest being the aggregated form of gamma interferon. The purified protein is a dimer under non-denaturing conditions and has a specific activity of 2 x 10(8) IU mg-1 protein, as measured by viral cytopathic assay.",M1
8890230,"<e>Gamma interferon</e> protects endothelial cells from damage by Candida albicans by inhibiting endothelial cell phagocytosis.Once Candida albicans comes in contact with endothelial cells, it induces cellular injury. This endothelial cell injury may be a mechanism by which blood-borne organisms escape from the intravascular compartment and invade the tissue parenchyma during hematogenous infection. We have been investigating the ability of cytokines to modulate endothelial cell injury caused by C. albicans. Previously we reported that pretreatment of endothelial cells with gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) protects these cells from candidal injury in vitro. In the current study, we examined potential mechanisms of the cytoprotective effects of IFN-gamma. Time course experiments demonstrated that maximal reduction in candidal injury of endothelial cells occurred after the endothelial cells had been exposed to IFN-gamma for at least 72 h. In other studies, we determined that IFN-gamma reduced endothelial cell phagocytosis of C. albicans by 41.3% compared with that of untreated endothelial cells (P &lt; 0.01). Since endothelial cell phagocytosis of C. albicans is required for damage to occur, inhibition of phagocytosis is likely a mechanism by which IFN-gamma protects endothelial cells from candidal injury. We also found that the cytoprotective effect of IFN-gamma is not mediated by reducing access of the organisms to intracellular endothelial cell iron or by upregulating the synthesis of reactive oxygen intermediates (which could potentially reduce the ability of C. albicans to injure endothelial cells). Thus, inhibiting endothelial cell phagocytosis of C. albicans may be a mechanism by which IFN-gamma augments the host defense against hematogenously disseminated candidal infections.",M1
8984943,"Safety and efficacy of recombinant <e>gamma interferon</e> in the treatment of systemic sclerosis.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant gamma interferon (rIFN gamma) in the treatment of patients with systemic sclerosis. METHODS: Sixteen patients with systemic sclerosis were treated with r-IFN gamma, 60 micrograms m-2 (low dose, n = 10) and 150 micrograms m-2 (high dose, n = 6), three times weekly in an open phase I/II trial of eight months duration. The patients were stratified in low and high dose according to the severity and the extent of scleroderma; the two groups were comparable. RESULTS: The treatment was well tolerated. The most common side effects, almost certainly related to r-IFN gamma, were fever, chills, dizziness, headache, and severe flu-like syndrome with decreasing intensity with the time of treatment. Severe aphthous stomatitis (n = 1), ventricular tachycardia (n = 1), severe oesophageal ulcers due to gastro-oesophageal reflux (n = 1), disease exacerbation alone with frank arthritis and slight pericardial effusion (n = 1), and inability to conform to the requirements of the study (n = 1) were the reasons for discontinuing treatment. Side effects and degree of response were evident during the first five months of treatment. A significant decrease in mean skin thickness score was observed and was higher in the high dose group. Reactive oxygen species of peripheral neutrophils and soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum concentrations were higher than those of normal individuals at study entry and decreased in parallel with clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of systemic sclerosis patients with r-IFN gamma was relatively safe and well tolerated for doses as high as 150 micrograms m-2 three times weekly. Side effects and the degree of response can be seen during the first months of therapy and can be used as predictors of ultimate toxicity or response. The drug seems to be effective in treating cutaneous scleroderma.",M1
8892737,"Inhibition of marrow CFU-E colony formation from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients by beta- and <e>gamma-interferon</e>.Increased production of cytokines such as beta-interferon (IFN) and gamma-IFN may contribute to the anemia frequently observed in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The hypothesis that HIV infection might enhance the susceptibility of erythroid progenitors to cytokine-mediated inhibition was evaluated by comparing the effects of beta- and gamma-IFN on in vitro colony formation by marrow erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) from HIV patients, normal volunteers, and anemic non-HIV-infected individuals. CFU-E colony formation from HIV patients was not significantly different from controls, and the degree of inhibition by IFN did not differ among patient subsets. HIV infection does not appear to impair baseline CFU-E colony formation, nor does it appear to enhance the susceptibility of CFU-E to suppression by cytokines.",M1
8917349,"Interferon gamma is highly effective against orthotopically-implanted human pleural adenocarcinoma in nude mice.The efficacy of recombinant human <e>gamma interferon</e> (rh IFN-gamma) was evaluated for the treatment of human pleural adenocarcinoma in a patient-like nude mice model which is constructed by surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI) of histologically-intact human tumor tissue. The human non-small-cell lung cancer cell line H-460 was used for the study. Gamma interferon was tested in three different dosages (25,000 U, 50,000 U and 100,000 U) versus an untreated control through i.p. injection twice a day for five days, which was started 48 hours after SOI; The results showed that IFN-gamma can prolong the survival time of the tumor-bearing animals. The symptoms and signs of hypoxia such as restricted physical activity and cyanosis due to primary tumor growth in the thoracic cavity as well as cachexia developed much earlier in the control than in the IFN-gamma-treated mice. The mice in the control group had succumbed by day-23 after tumor implantation, however at that time 67% of the mice in the 100,000 U-treated group, 15% of the mice in the 50,000 U-treated group, and 16% of the mice in the 25,000 U-treated group were still alive. The orthotopically-transplanted tumor grew rapidly and metastasized to the lung and liver in the untreated control. In the IFN-gamma-treated groups both primary tumor growth and metastasis were reduced, probably accounting for the increased survival rate. The results demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of IFN-gamma in suppressing symptomology, primary tumor growth, invasiveness and metastasis of the human lung cancer cell line H 460, and increased survival of the tumor-bearing animals. These results suggest clinical trials of IFN-gamma should begin for treatment of pleural adenocarcinoma for which there is no current effective therapy.",M1
20484512,"Differential activation of NK cells by influenza A pseudotype H5N1 and 1918 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses.Natural killer (NK) cells are the effectors of innate immunity and are recruited into the lung 48 h after influenza virus infection. Functional NK cell activation can be triggered by the interaction between viral hemagglutinin (HA) and natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp46 and NKp44 on the cell surface. Recently, novel subtypes of influenza viruses, such as H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1, transmitted directly to the human population, with unusual mortality and morbidity rates. Here, the human NK cell responses to these viruses were studied. Differential activation of heterogeneous NK cells (upregulation of CD69 and CD107a and <e>gamma interferon</e> [IFN-gamma] production as well as downregulation of NKp46) was observed following interactions with H5N1, 1918 H1N1, and 2009 H1N1 pseudotyped particles (pps), respectively, and the responses of the CD56(dim) subset predominated. Much stronger NK activation was triggered by H5N1 and 1918 H1N1 pps than by 2009 H1N1 pps. The interaction of pps with NK cells and subsequent internalization were mediated by NKp46 partially. The NK cell activation by pps showed a dosage-dependent manner, while an increasing viral HA titer attenuated NK activation phenotypes, cytotoxicity, and IFN-gamma production. The various host innate immune responses to different influenza virus subtypes or HA titers may be associated with disease severity.",M2
20457786,"Immunogenicity and protection induced by a Mycobacterium tuberculosis sigE mutant in a BALB/c mouse model of progressive pulmonary tuberculosis.Tuberculosis is still one of the main challenges to human global health, leading to about two million deaths every year. One of the reasons for its success is the lack of efficacy of the widely used vaccine Mycobacterium bovis BCG. In this article, we analyze the potential use of an attenuated mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv lacking the sigma factor sigma(E) as a live vaccine. We have demonstrated that BALB/c mice infected by the intratracheal route with this mutant strain showed significantly higher survival rates and less tissue damage than animals infected with the parental or complemented mutant strain. Although animals infected with the sigE mutant had low bacillary loads, their lungs showed significantly higher production of the protective factors <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and beta-defensins than those of animals infected with the parental or complemented mutant strain. Moreover, we demonstrate that the sigE mutant, when inoculated subcutaneously, was more attenuated than BCG in immunodeficient nude mice, thus representing a good candidate for a novel attenuated live vaccine strain. Finally, when we used the sigE mutant as a subcutaneous vaccine, it was able to induce a higher level of protection than did BCG with both H37Rv and a highly virulent strain of M. tuberculosis (Beijing code 9501000). Taken together, our findings suggest that the sigE mutant is a very promising strain for the development of a new vaccine against tuberculosis.",M2
20436432,"[The use of canonical correlation analysis for the evaluation of correlation strength between clinical and biological parameters]We studied correlations between factors of inherent immunity and the effectiveness of therapy in patients with endogenous psychosis using the method of canonical correlations. There were strong significant (canonical R&gt;0,8; p=0,02) positive correlations between the therapeutic effectiveness of neuroleptics (haloperidol and clozapine) and values of factors of inherent immunity in the group of 34 men with schizophrenia, aged from 16 to 34 years, with the first episode of psychosis. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed by the percentage reduction of total scores on the PANSS scale or scores on PANSS subscales (positive, negative and general psychopathology) at the beginning and the end (after 60 days) of the treatment. Initial parameters of factors of inherent immunity (levels of <e>gamma-interferon</e> production by T-lymphocytes, proportion of phagocytosing neutrophils and monocytes, and cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes - natural killers) contributed to 67,3%, or more than two thirds, of the variance of treatment effects. The contribution of inherent immunity factors was determined mainly by their similar effects on the reduction of positive and general psychopathological symptoms, with the minimal effect on the reduction of negative symptoms. The maximum correlation was found for weighting coefficients for inherent immunity factors estimated as 0,567 for the proportion of phagocytosing neutrophils and monocytes; 0,518 - for the levels of gamma-interferon production by T-lymphocytes and 0,334 - for cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes - natural killers. The authors suggest that the reduction of activity of the cell branch of inherent immunity develops before the disease manifestation. It creates conditions for the activation of latently persistent infections (the cytomegalovirus infection, in our case) in a patient's organism, with the formation of therapeutic resistance. The method described may be widely used in clinical and biological psychiatry and neurology.",M2
20435630,"T cell recognition of self-antigen presenting cells by protein transfer assay reveals a high frequency of anti-myelin T cells in multiple sclerosis.Although peripheral blood myelin-autoreactive T cells are thought to play a key role in multiple sclerosis, they are generally considered to have qualitative differences rather than quantitative ones when compared to those found in healthy individuals. Here, we revisited the assessment of myelin-autoreactive T cells in a new approach based on their combined ability to acquire membrane proteins from autologous antigen presenting cells, and to respond to whole myelin extract as the stimulating autoantigen. Using this approach, the myelin-autoreactive T cell frequency in patients with multiple sclerosis was found to be unexpectedly high (n = 22, subtracted values median 2.08%, range 0-6%; background median 1%, range 0-4%) and to exceed that of age/gender-matched healthy individuals significantly (n = 18, subtracted values median 0.1%, range 0-5.3%, P &lt; 0.0001; background median 1.45%, range 0.1-4%). Higher anti-myelin autoreactivity was stable in patients with multiple sclerosis after several months. These data correlated with whole myelin-induced <e>gamma interferon</e>-enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay performed under the same conditions, although the values obtained with enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay under all conditions were 58 times lower than with this new method. The myelin-autoreactive T cells were memory T cells expressing CD40L with a CD62(low) phenotype, suggesting their ability for homing to tissues. Collectively, these new data show a higher frequency of autoreactive T cells during multiple sclerosis than in age/gender-matched healthy individuals, and support an autoimmune aetiology in multiple sclerosis.",M2
20410263,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes established by seasonal human influenza cross-react against 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus.While few children and young adults have cross-protective antibodies to the pandemic H1N1 2009 (pdmH1N1) virus, the illness remains mild. The biological reasons for these epidemiological observations are unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the bulk memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) established by seasonal influenza viruses from healthy individuals who have not been exposed to pdmH1N1 can directly lyse pdmH1N1-infected target cells and produce <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Using influenza A virus matrix protein 1 (M1(58-66)) epitope-specific CTLs isolated from healthy HLA-A2(+) individuals, we further found that M1(58-66) epitope-specific CTLs efficiently killed both M1(58-66) peptide-pulsed and pdmH1N1-infected target cells ex vivo. These M1(58-66)-specific CTLs showed an effector memory phenotype and expressed CXCR3 and CCR5 chemokine receptors. Of 94 influenza A virus CD8 T-cell epitopes obtained from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), 17 epitopes are conserved in pdmH1N1, and more than half of these conserved epitopes are derived from M1 protein. In addition, 65% (11/17) of these epitopes were 100% conserved in seasonal influenza vaccine H1N1 strains during the last 20 years. Importantly, seasonal influenza vaccination could expand the functional M1(58-66) epitope-specific CTLs in 20% (4/20) of HLA-A2(+) individuals. Our results indicated that memory CTLs established by seasonal influenza A viruses or vaccines had cross-reactivity against pdmH1N1. These might explain, at least in part, the unexpected mild pdmH1N1 illness in the community and also might provide some valuable insights for the future design of broadly protective vaccines to prevent influenza, especially pandemic influenza.",M2
20404082,"Chronic intestinal helminth infections are associated with immune hyporesponsiveness and induction of a regulatory network.Helminth infections have been associated with protection against allergy and autoimmune diseases. We investigated the effects of chronic infections with Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura (measured twice over a 5-year period) on cytokine and antibody responses. We collected blood from 1,060 children aged 4 to 11 years living in a poor urban area of Brazil and measured Th1 (<e>gamma interferon</e> [IFN-gamma]) and Th2 (interleukin-5 [IL-5] and IL-13) cytokines and the regulatory cytokine IL-10 in unstimulated and stimulated (with mitogen or A. lumbricoides antigens) cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes and levels of total IgE and anti-A. lumbricoides IgG4 and IgE in serum. Intestinal helminth infections were associated with an increased proportion of children producing IL-5 in response to A. lumbricoides and producing IL-10 spontaneously, especially among coinfected and chronically infected children. Helminth infections were associated with a generalized suppression of cytokine responses to mitogen. Levels of total IgE and anti-A. lumbricoides IgG4 and IgE were especially elevated in chronically infected children. In conclusion, intestinal helminth infections were associated with a typical Th2 immune response profile and with the induction of immune hyporesponsiveness that was associated with greater frequencies of the production of spontaneous IL-10.",M2
20404074,"Human brucellosis is characterized by an intense Th1 profile associated with a defective monocyte function.In animal models, a defective Th1 response appears to be critical in the pathogenesis of brucellosis, but the Th1 response in human brucellosis patients remains partially undefined. Peripheral blood from 24 brucellosis patients was studied before and 45 days after antibiotherapy. Twenty-four sex- and age-matched healthy donors were analyzed in parallel. Significantly increased levels of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12p40, <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), but not of IL-10, in serum and/or significantly increased percentages of samples with detectable levels of these cytokines, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), were found for untreated brucellosis patients, but these levels were reduced and/or normalized after treatment. Flow cytometry studies showed that the intracytoplasmic expression of IFN-gamma, IL-2, and TNF-alpha, but not that of IL-4, by phorbol myristate-activated CD4(+) CD3(+) and CD8(+) CD3(+) T lymphocytes was significantly increased in untreated brucellosis patients and was also partially normalized after antibiotherapy. The percentage of phagocytic cells, the mean phagocytic activity per cell, and the phagocytic indices for monocytes at baseline were defective and had only partially reverted at follow-up. T lymphocytes from untreated brucellosis patients are activated in vivo and show Th1 cytokine production polarization, with strikingly high serum IFN-gamma levels. In spite of this Th1 environment, we found deficient effector phagocytic activity in peripheral blood monocytes.",M2

Male Wistar rats were infected with the Y strain of T. cruzi. Experiments were performed on 7, 14 and 21 days post-infection. Several immunological parameters were evaluated including <e>gamma-interferon</e> (IFN-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). The combined treatment with melatonin and meloxicam significantly enhanced the release of IL-2 and INF-gamma into animals' serum, when compared with the infected control groups during the course of infection. Furthermore, the blockade of PGE(2) synthesis and the increased release of NO by macrophage cells from T. cruzi-infected animals contributed to regulate the production of Th1 subset cytokines significantly reducing the parasitaemia in animals treated with the combination of both substances. Therefore, our results suggest that the association of melatonin and meloxicam was more effective in protecting animals against the harmful actions of T. cruzi infection as compared with the treatments of meloxicam or melatonin alone.",M2

While the majority of reports focused on how the promastigote form can alter macrophage (Mphi) signaling and function, fewer reports investigated signaling alterations mediated by amastigotes, and there is a lack of comparative studies. In this study, we performed a comparison between the ability of both forms of the parasite to alter Mphi signaling and functions. Here, we show that both promastigotes and amastigotes were able to rapidly activate host protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), importantly the Src homology 2 domain-containing PTP (SHP-1). However, we found that PTP-1B is specifically activated by promastigote but not amastigote infection and that lmcpb(-/-) promastigotes were no longer able to activate PTP-1B. We also show a similarity in the way promastigotes and amastigotes inactivate the transcription factors (TFs) STAT-1alpha and AP-1, but we show differences in the modulation of NF-kappaB, with promastigotes cleaving the p65 subunit, generating a smaller p35 subunit, and amastigotes fully degrading the p65 subunit with no p35 production. Importantly, we show that the cysteine proteinase LmCPb plays a key role in the alteration of NF-kappaB, STAT-1alpha, and AP-1 by promastigote and amastigote infections, ultimately leading to the inability of these TFs to translocate to the nucleus in response to <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) stimulation and thus contributing to the ability of both parasite forms to effectively block IFN-gamma-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production in Mphis.",M2
20351146,"Alpha-galactosylceramide promotes killing of Listeria monocytogenes within the macrophage phagosome through invariant NKT-cell activation.alpha-Galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) has been exploited for the treatment of microbial infections. Although amelioration of infection by alpha-GalCer involves invariant natural killer T (iNKT)-cell activation, it remains to be determined whether macrophages (Mphi) participate in the control of microbial pathogens. In the present study, we examined the participation of Mphi in immune intervention in infection by alpha-GalCer using a murine model of listeriosis. Phagocytic and bactericidal activities of peritoneal Mphi from C57BL/6 mice, but not iNKT cell-deficient mice, were enhanced after intraperitoneal injection of alpha-GalCer despite the absence of iNKT cells in the peritoneal cavity. High levels of <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) and nitric oxide (NO) were detected in the peritoneal cavities of mice treated with alpha-GalCer and in culture supernatants of peritoneal Mphi from mice treated with alpha-GalCer, respectively. Although enhanced bactericidal activity of peritoneal Mphi by alpha-GalCer was abrogated by endogenous IFN-gamma neutralization, this was only marginally affected by NO inhibition. Similar results were obtained by using a listeriolysin O-deficient strain of Listeria monocytogenes. Moreover, respiratory burst in Mphi was increased after alpha-GalCer treatment. Our results suggest that amelioration of listeriosis by alpha-GalCer is, in part, caused by enhanced killing of L. monocytogenes within phagosomes of Mphi activated by IFN-gamma from iNKT cells residing in an organ(s) other than the peritoneal cavity.",M2
20351140,"<e>Gamma interferon</e> produced by antigen-specific CD4+ T cells regulates the mucosal immune responses to Citrobacter rodentium infection.Citrobacter rodentium, a murine model pathogen for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, colonizes the surface of intestinal epithelial cells and causes mucosal inflammation. This bacterium is an ideal model for investigating pathogen-host immune interactions in the gut. It is well known that gene transcripts for Th1 cytokines are highly induced in colonic tissue from mice infected with C. rodentium. However, it remains to be seen whether the Th1 or Th2 cytokines produced by antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells provide effective regulation of the host immune defense against C. rodentium infection. To investigate the antigen-specific immune responses, C. rodentium expressing ovalbumin (OVA-C. rodentium), a model antigen, was generated and used to define antigen-specific responses under gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-deficient or interleukin-4 (IL-4)-deficient conditions in vivo. The activation of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells and macrophage phagocytosis were evaluated in the presence of IFN-gamma or IL-4 in vitro. IFN-gamma-deficient mice exhibited a loss of body weight and a higher bacterial concentration in feces during OVA-C. rodentium infection than C57BL/6 (wild type) or IL-4-deficient mice. This occurred through the decreased efficiency of macrophage phagocytosis and the activation of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, a deficiency in antigen-specific CD4(+) T-cell-expressed IFN-gamma led to a higher susceptibility to mucosal and gut-derived systemic OVA-C. rodentium infection. These results show that the IFN-gamma produced by antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells plays an important role in the defense against C. rodentium.",M2
20231414,"YopJ-promoted cytotoxicity and systemic colonization are associated with high levels of murine interleukin-18, <e>gamma interferon</e>, and neutrophils in a live vaccine model of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection.Several Yersinia species have been utilized as live attenuated vaccines to prime protective immunity against yersiniae and other pathogens. A type III secretion system effector known as YopJ in Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis and YopP in Y. enterocolitica has been shown to regulate host immune responses to live Yersinia vaccines. YopJ/P kills macrophages and dendritic cells, reduces their production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-12 (IL-12), and promotes systemic colonization in mouse models of intestinal Yersinia infection. Furthermore, YopP activity decreases antigen presentation by dendritic cells, and a yopP mutant of a live Y. enterocolitica carrier vaccine elicited effective priming of CD8 T cells to a heterologous antigen in mice. These results suggest that YopJ/P activity suppresses both innate and adaptive immune responses to live Yersinia vaccines. Here, a sublethal intragastric mouse infection model using wild-type and catalytically inactive yopJ mutant strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis was developed to further investigate how YopJ action impacts innate and adaptive immune responses to a live vaccine. Surprisingly, YopJ-promoted cytotoxicity and systemic colonization were associated with significant increases in neutrophils in spleens and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-18 and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in serum samples of mice vaccinated with Y. pseudotuberculosis. Secretion of IL-18 accompanied YopJ-mediated killing of macrophages infected ex vivo with Y. pseudotuberculosis, suggesting a mechanism by which this effector directly increases proinflammatory cytokine levels in vivo. Mice vaccinated with the wild-type strain or the yopJ mutant produced similar levels of antibodies to Y. pseudotuberculosis antigens and were equally resistant to lethal intravenous challenge with Y. pestis. The findings indicate that a proinflammatory, rather than anti-inflammatory, process accompanies YopJ-promoted cytotoxicity, leading to increased systemic colonization by Y. pseudotuberculosis and potentially enhancing adaptive immunity to a live vaccine.",M2
20231412,"Impairment of host defense against disseminated candidiasis in mice overexpressing GATA-3.Candida species are the most common source of nosocomial invasive fungal infections. Previous studies have indicated that T-helper immune response is the critical host factor for susceptibility to Candida infection. The transcription factor GATA-3 is known as the master regulator for T-helper type 2 (Th2) differentiation. We therefore investigated the role of GATA-3 in the host defense against systemic Candida infection using GATA-3-overexpressing transgenic mice. The survival of GATA-3-overexpressing mice after Candida infection was significantly lower than that of wild-type mice. Candida outgrowth was significantly increased in the kidneys of GATA-3-overexpressing mice, compared with wild-type mice. The levels of various Th2 cytokines, including interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13, were significantly higher while the level of Th1 cytokine <e>gamma interferon</e> was significantly lower in the splenocytes of GATA-3-overexpressing mice after Candida infection. Recruitment of macrophages into the peritoneal cavity in response to Candida infection and their phagocytic activity were significantly lower in GATA-3-overexpressing mice than in wild-type mice. Exogenous administration of gamma interferon to GATA-3-overexpressing mice significantly reduced Candida outgrowth in the kidney and thus increased the survival rate. Administration of gamma interferon also increased the recruitment of macrophages into the peritoneal cavity in response to Candida infection. These results indicate that overexpression of GATA-3 modulates macrophage antifungal activity and thus enhances the susceptibility to systemic Candida infection, possibly by reducing the production of gamma interferon in response to Candida infection.",M2
20231405,"Chlamydia muridarum T-cell antigens formulated with the adjuvant DDA/TDB induce immunity against infection that correlates with a high frequency of <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma)/tumor necrosis factor alpha and IFN-gamma/interleukin-17 double-positive CD4+ T cells.Major impediments to developing a Chlamydia vaccine lie in identifying immunologically relevant T-cell antigens and delivery in a manner to stimulate protective immunity. Using an immunoproteomic approach, we previously identified three immunodominant Chlamydia T-cell antigens (PmpG-1, PmpE/F-2, and RplF). Because RplF has high homology to a human ortholog, it may not be suitable for human vaccine development. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated protection against Chlamydia infection in the genital tract in C57BL/6 mice immunized with Chlamydia-specific membrane proteins PmpG-1, PmpE/F-2, and major outer membrane protein (MOMP; as a reference) or a combination of them formulated with one of three adjuvants, CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN), AbISCO-100 (AbISCO), or DDA/TDB (dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide/D-(+)-trehalose 6,6'-dibehenate). The results show that immunization with the CpG-ODN formulation failed to provide protection against Chlamydia infection; the AbISCO formulation conferred moderate protection, and the DDA/TDB formulation showed the highest degree of protective efficacy. The combination of PmpG-1, PmpE/F-2, and MOMP proteins formulated with DDA/TDB exhibited the greatest degree of protection among all vaccine groups studied. Moreover, this vaccine combination also engendered significant protection in BALB/c mice, which have a different major histocompatibility complex (MHC) background. We measured cell-mediated immune cytokine responses in mice immunized with PmpG-1 mixed with each of the three adjuvants. The results demonstrate that mice immunized with the DDA/TDB formulation induced the strongest gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) responses, characterized by the highest frequency of IFN-gamma/tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and IFN-gamma/IL-17 double-positive CD4(+) T cells. In conclusion, a Chlamydia vaccine based on the recombinant proteins PmpG-1, PmpE/F-2, and MOMP delivered in a DDA/TDB adjuvant conferred protection against infection that correlated with IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma/IL-17 double-positive CD4(+) T cells.",M2
20224078,"Optimization of a whole blood <e>gamma interferon</e> assay for the detection of sheep infected with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis.The capacity of a commercially available gamma interferon (IFNgamma) assay to detect infected sheep early in the pathogenesis of Johne's disease enables the removal of such animals from the flock before bacterial shedding and pasture contamination. However, nonspecific IFNgamma responses in the assay have meant that to achieve high-test specificity, there has been a reduction in sensitivity. Although the optimal conditions for the use of the assay in cattle have been well documented, there have been few studies optimizing the assay for use in sheep. The current study details the effect of anticoagulant, duration of incubation, cell concentration, blood storage temperature, time of stimulation of cells with antigen relative to time of sample collection, and temperatures during transit on IFNgamma synthesis. Maximal IFNgamma synthesis occurred with incubation periods of 48 hr in blood collected into heparinized tubes. Decreasing the leukocyte population by diluting the total peripheral blood leukocyte concentration was associated with a decreasing IFNgamma response. Conversely, concentrating the peripheral blood concentration 2-fold resulted in an increase in the IFNgamma production. In field studies, immediate incubation of blood samples with antigen at 37 degrees C resulted in larger IFNgamma responses; however, significantly lower IFNgamma values were obtained if the samples were transported at ambient temperature. The results of this study indicate that optimization of the IFNgamma assay may enable increased synthesis of IFNgamma during the stimulation phase of the assay and that future work may determine whether this translates to increased sensitivity of the assay in detecting early infections in sheep.",M2
20219880,"Pilot study of whole-blood <e>gamma interferon</e> response to the Vibrio cholerae toxin B subunit and resistance to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-associated diarrhea.Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which produces heat-labile toxin (LT), is a common cause of travelers' diarrhea (TD). The B subunit of ETEC LT is immunologically related to the B subunit of Vibrio cholerae toxin (CT). In this pilot study we evaluated the whole-blood gamma interferon response to CT B in 17 U.S. adults traveling to Mexico. Only one of nine subjects who demonstrated a cellular immune response as determined by whole-blood gamma interferon production to CT B on arrival to Mexico developed diarrhea, whereas five of eight without a cellular response developed diarrhea. Markers of the cellular immune response to ETEC LT could help in identifying individuals immune to ETEC LT, and these markers deserve additional study.",M2
20219874,"Chlamydia pneumoniae-induced memory CD4+ T-cell activation in human peripheral blood correlates with distinct antibody response patterns.Chlamydia pneumoniae is a frequent pathogen of the respiratory tract, and persistent infections with this obligate intracellular bacterium have been associated with different severe sequelae. Although T-cell activation during acute C. pneumoniae infections has been described, little is known about the frequency or the role of the C. pneumoniae-specific memory T cells that reside in the human body after the resolution of the infection. In the present study, the C. pneumoniae-induced T-cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 56 healthy volunteers were analyzed and compared to the donor's serum antibody reactivity toward whole C. pneumoniae as well as recombinant C. pneumoniae antigens. Following short-term stimulation with C. pneumoniae, both <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma)- and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-producing CD4(+) T-cell responses could be detected in 16 of 56 healthy individuals. C. pneumoniae-activated CD4(+) T cells expressed CD154, a marker for T-cell receptor-dependent activation, and displayed a phenotype of central memory T cells showing dominant IL-2 production but also IFN-gamma production. Interestingly, individuals with both IFN-gamma- and IL-2-producing responses showed significantly decreased immunoglobulin G reactivity toward C. pneumoniae RpoA and DnaK, antigens known to be strongly upregulated during chlamydial persistence, compared to IgG reactivity of seropositive individuals with no T-cell response or CD4(+) T-cell responses involving the production of a single cytokine (IFN-gamma or IL-2). Our results demonstrate that memory CD4(+) T cells responding to C. pneumoniae stimulation can be detected in the circulation of healthy donors. Furthermore, among seropositive individuals, the presence or the absence of dual IFN-gamma- and IL-2-producing T-cell responses was associated with distinct patterns of antibody responses toward persistence-associated C. pneumoniae antigens.",M2
20218881,"Differential inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and TZM-bl cells by endotoxin-mediated chemokine and <e>gamma interferon</e> production.Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) is a frequent contaminant of biological specimens and is also known to be a potent inducer of beta-chemokines and other soluble factors that inhibit HIV-1 infection in vitro. Though lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to stimulate the production of soluble HIV-1 inhibitors in cultures of monocyte-derived macrophages, the ability of LPS to induce similar inhibitors in other cell types is poorly characterized. Here we show that LPS exhibits potent anti-HIV activity in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) but has no detectable anti-HIV-1 activity in TZM-bl cells. The anti-HIV-1 activity of LPS in PBMCs was strongly associated with the production of beta-chemokines from CD14-positive monocytes. Culture supernatants from LPS-stimulated PBMCs exhibited potent anti-HIV-1 activity when added to TZM-bl cells but, in this case, the antiviral activity appeared to be related to IFN-gamma rather than to beta-chemokines. These observations indicate that LPS stimulates PBMCs to produce a complex array of soluble HIV-1 inhibitors, including beta-chemokines and IFN-gamma, that differentially inhibit HIV-1 depending on the target cell type. The results also highlight the need to use endotoxin-free specimens to avoid artifacts when assessing HIV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies in PBMC-based assays.",M2
20200251,"Delivery of cytokines by recombinant virus in early life alters the immune response to adult lung infection.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main cause of bronchiolitis, the major cause of hospitalization of infants. An ideal RSV vaccine would be effective for neonates, but the immune responses of infants differ markedly from those of adults, often showing a bias toward T-helper 2 (Th2) responses and reduced <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) production. We previously developed recombinant RSV vectors expressing IFN-gamma and interleukin-4 (IL-4) that allow us to explore the role of these key Th1 and Th2 cytokines during infection. The aim of the current study was to explore whether an immunomodulation of infant responses could enhance protection. The expression of IFN-gamma by a recombinant RSV vector (RSV/IFN-gamma) attenuated primary viral replication in newborn mice without affecting the development of specific antibody or T-cell responses. Upon challenge, RSV/IFN-gamma mice were protected from the exacerbated disease observed for mice primed with wild-type RSV; however, antiviral immunity was not enhanced. Conversely, the expression of IL-4 by recombinant RSV did not affect virus replication in neonates but greatly enhanced Th2 immune responses upon challenge without affecting weight loss. These studies demonstrate that it is possible to manipulate infant immune responses by using cytokine-expressing recombinant viruses and that neonatal deficiency in IFN-gamma responses may lead to enhanced disease during secondary infection.",M2
20194594,"CCR7-dependent immunity during acute Toxoplasma gondii infection.The chemokine receptor CCR7 is a well-established homing receptor for dendritic cells and T cells. Interactions with its ligands, CCL19 and CCL21, facilitate priming of immune responses in lymphoid tissue, yet CCR7-independent immune responses can be generated in the presence of sufficient antigen. In these studies, we investigated the role of CCR7 signaling in the generation of protective immune responses to the intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The results demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of CCL19, CCL21, and CCR7 in peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) tissues over the course of infection. Unexpectedly, despite the presence of abundant antigen, CCR7 was an absolute requirement for protective immunity to T. gondii, as CCR7(-/-) mice succumbed to the parasite early in the acute phase of infection. Although serum levels of interleukin 12 (IL-12), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-10 remained unchanged, there was a significant decrease in CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and inflammatory monocyte recruitment to the site of infection. In addition, CCR7(-/-) mice failed to produce sufficient <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma), a critical Th1-associated effector cytokine required to control parasite replication. As a result, there was increased parasite dissemination and a significant increase in parasite burden in the lungs, livers, and brains of infected mice. Adoptive-transfer experiments revealed that expression of CCR7 on the T-cell compartment alone is sufficient to enable T-cell priming, increase IFN-gamma production, and allow the survival of CCR7(-/-) mice. These data demonstrate an absolute requirement for T-cell expression of CCR7 for the generation of protective immune responses to Toxoplasma infection.",M2
20181768,"Assessment of Imprecision in <e>gamma interferon</e> release assays for the detection of exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.New gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) release assays (IGRAs) to detect an exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis have recently been launched. The majority of the studies in temperate-climate countries agree that these methods have superior specificity and equal or even superior sensitivity over tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) in the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI). However, reproducibility data of IGRAs are virtually missing. We assessed within-run, between-run, and total imprecision of two commercial IGRAs by testing samples from subjects with a stable state of TB infection or treated pulmonary TB, a sample from a healthy volunteer, and internal quality control samples. We calculated coefficients of variance (CV%s) to describe assays variability and compared the obtained results to the reported CV%s for other commercial immunodiagnostic methods. We illustrate an example of assay variability near the cutoff zone to demonstrate the necessity of a gray zone. Due to the strict adherence to the standard operation procedures (SOP) adopted in our laboratory, the total imprecision of enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT)- and enzyme immunoassay (EIA)-based IGRAs was at a maximum CV% of 37.8% for the samples with moderate and high reactivities. Imprecision of testing samples with very low reactivity levels or nonreactive samples may, however, exceed 100%. In conclusion, despite multiple steps of the method performance, the analytical imprecision of IGRAs, which in our study design included also between-lot variability and had a component of normal biological variation, was well in accordance with the reported imprecisions of other manual immunodiagnostic tests. The recognition of the variability around the cutoff point advocates the use of a gray zone to avoid ambiguous result interpretations.",M2
20181704,"T cells facilitate recovery from Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus-induced encephalomyelitis in the absence of antibody.Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus of the genus Alphavirus that is responsible for a significant disease burden in Central and South America through sporadic outbreaks into human and equid populations. For humans, 2 to 4% of cases are associated with encephalitis, and there is an overall case mortality rate of approximately 1%. In mice, replication of the virus within neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) leads to paralyzing, invariably lethal encephalomyelitis. However, mice infected with certain attenuated mutants of the virus are able to control the infection within the CNS and recover. To better define what role T cell responses might be playing in this process, we infected B cell-deficient microMT mice with a VEEV mutant that induces mild, sublethal illness in immune competent mice. Infected microMT mice rapidly developed the clinical signs of severe paralyzing encephalomyelitis but were eventually able to control the infection and recover fully from clinical illness. Recovery in this system was T cell dependent and associated with a dramatic reduction in viral titers within the CNS, followed by viral persistence in the brain. Further comparison of the relative roles of T cell subpopulations within this system revealed that CD4(+) T cells were better producers of <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) than CD8(+) T cells and were more effective at controlling VEEV within the CNS. Overall, these results suggest that T cells, especially CD4(+) T cells, can successfully control VEEV infection within the CNS and facilitate recovery from a severe viral encephalomyelitis.",M2
20177910,"Toxoplasma gondii microneme protein 8 (MIC8) is a potential vaccine candidate against toxoplasmosis.Microneme protein 8 (MIC8) is considered a new essential invasion factor in Toxoplasma gondii. In the present study, a deoxyribonucleic acid vaccine expressing MIC8 of T. gondii was constructed and the immune response it induced in Kunming mice was evaluated. The gene sequence encoding MIC8 was inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pVAX I, and the pVAX-MIC8 expression plasmid was constructed, and the plasmid diluted with PBS to 100 mg/100 microl was injected into the Kunming mice muscularly. Levels of IgG antibody, <e>gamma-interferon</e> (IFN-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4, and interleukin-10 were detected. The mice were challenged with tachyzoites of the virulent T. gondii RH strain at the 14th day after the last immunization to observe the survival time. The high level of IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IgG antibody indicated that mice vaccinated with recombinant pVAX-MIC8 plasmid could elicit strong cellular and humoral immune responses and showed a significantly increased survival time (10.3 +/- 0.9 days) compared with control mice which died within 5 days of challenge infection. These data demonstrate that the T. gondii MIC8 is a potential vaccine candidate against toxoplasmosis.",M2
20176901,"Immunotherapy markedly increases the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy for treatment of Burkholderia pseudomallei infection.Burkholderia pseudomallei is a soil bacterium that is endemic in southeast Asia and northern Australia and that can cause both acutely lethal pneumonia and chronic systemic infections in humans. The effective treatment of infection with B. pseudomallei requires rapid diagnosis and prolonged treatment with high doses of antimicrobials, and even with appropriate antibiotic therapy, patient relapses are common. Thus, new approaches to the treatment of B. pseudomallei infections are needed. In the present study, we asked whether active immunotherapy with <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma), a key cytokine regulating the intracellular replication of B. pseudomallei, could increase the effectiveness of conventional antimicrobial therapy for B. pseudomallei infection. Macrophage infection assays and in vivo pulmonary challenge models were used to assess the inhibitory effects of combined treatment with IFN-gamma and ceftazidime on B. pseudomallei infection. We found that treatment with even very low doses of IFN-gamma and ceftazidime elicited strong synergistic inhibition of B. pseudomallei growth within infected macrophages. In vivo, active immunotherapy markedly potentiated the effectiveness of low-dose ceftazidime therapy for the treatment of infected mice in a pulmonary challenge model of B. pseudomallei. Combined treatment was associated with a significant reduction in the bacterial burden and a significant lessening of bacterial dissemination. We concluded, therefore, that immunotherapy with either endogenous or exogenous IFN-gamma could significantly increase the effectiveness of conventional antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute B. pseudomallei infection.",M2
20164252,"A DNA vaccine-encoded nucleoprotein of influenza virus fails to induce cellular immune responses in a diabetic mouse model.Influenza virus infections cause yearly epidemics and are a major cause of lower respiratory tract illnesses in humans worldwide. Influenza virus has long been recognized to be associated with higher morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Vaccination is an effective tool to prevent influenza virus infection in this group of patients. Vaccines employing recombinant-DNA technologies are an alternative to inactivated virus and live attenuated virus vaccines. Internal highly conserved viral nucleoprotein (NP) can be delivered as a DNA vaccine to provide heterosubtypic immunity, offering resistance against various influenza virus strains. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of an NP DNA vaccine for induction of cell-mediated immune responses and protection against influenza virus infection in a mouse model of diabetes. Healthy and diabetic BALB/c mice were immunized on days 0, 14, and 28 by injection of NP DNA vaccine. Two weeks after the last immunization, the cellular immune response was evaluated by <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma), lymphocyte proliferation, and cytotoxicity assays. The mice were challenged with influenza virus, and the viral titers in the lungs were measured on day 4. Diabetic mice showed significantly smaller amounts of IFN-gamma production, lymphocyte proliferation, and cytotoxicity responses than nondiabetic mice. Furthermore, higher titers of the influenza virus were detected after challenge in the lungs of the diabetic mice. The present data suggest that the NP DNA vaccine with the protocol of immunization described here is not able to induce efficient cellular immune responses against influenza virus infection in diabetic mice.",M2
20164222,"T-cell correlates of vaccine efficacy after a heterologous simian immunodeficiency virus challenge.Determining the  correlates of protection  is one of the challenges in human immunodeficiency virus vaccine design. To date, T-cell-based AIDS vaccines have been evaluated with validated techniques that measure the number of CD8(+) T cells in the blood that secrete cytokines, mainly <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma), in response to synthetic peptides. Despite providing accurate and reproducible measurements of immunogenicity, these methods do not directly assess antiviral function and thus may not identify protective CD8(+) T-cell responses. To better understand the correlates of vaccine efficacy, we analyzed the immune responses elicited by a successful T-cell-based vaccine against a heterologous simian immunodeficiency virus challenge. We searched for correlates of protection using a viral suppression assay (VSA) and an IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay. While the VSA measured in vitro suppression, it did not predict the outcome of the vaccine trial. However, we found several aspects of the vaccine-induced T-cell response that were associated with improved outcome after challenge. Of note, broad vaccine-induced prechallenge T-cell responses directed against Gag and Vif correlated with lower viral loads and higher CD4(+) lymphocyte counts. These results may be relevant for the development of T-cell-based AIDS vaccines since they indicate that broad epitope-specific repertoires elicited by vaccination might serve as a correlate of vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, the present study demonstrates that certain viral proteins may be more effective than others as vaccine immunogens.",M2
20136961,"Preventive effects of Schistosoma japonicum ova on trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis and bacterial translocation in mice.AIMS: To evaluate the preventive effects of Schistosoma japonicum ova on trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis and bacterial translocation in mice. METHODS: BALB/c mice were randomly divided into three groups: control group; TNBS(+)Ova(-) group; and TNBS(+)Ova(+) group. Mice of the TNBS(+)Ova(+) group were exposed to 10 000 freeze-killed S. japonicum ova by i.p. injection on day 1 and day 11. On day 15, mice were challenged with TNBS to induce colitis. The following variables were assessed: colon pathological changes; serum expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), <e>gamma-interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-10 (IL-10); expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in colon; IFN-gamma, IL-10 and TLR4 mRNA expression in colon; and the bacterial translocation rate. RESULTS: Compared to TNBS(+)Ova(-) group, the colonic inflammation in the TNBS(+)Ova(+) group were relieved. A highly significant elevation of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were observed in the TNBS-induced colitis group. After exposure to the eggs, IFN-gamma was significantly decreased, while TNF-alpha was similar to that of the TNBS(+)ova(-) group. No obvious variation was seen in IL-10 expression in TNBS-induced colitis, compared to the controls. Exposure to the eggs led to a significant upregulation of IL-10 expression. TLR4 expression was elevated after injected with TNBS and was downregulated in the eggs group. Less intestinal bacterial translocation frequency was observed when exposed to eggs. CONCLUSION: S. japonicum ova can prevent the TNBS-induced colitis and reduce the bacterial translocation frequency in mice. The mechanisms were supposed to be due to the regulation of T-helper cell 1/2 balance and TLR4 expression.",M2
20130691,"Aeromonas caviae strain induces Th1 cytokine response in mouse intestinal tract.Aeromonas caviae has been associated with human gastrointestinal disease. Strains of this species typically lack virulence factors (VFs) such as enterotoxins and hemolysins that are produced by other human pathogens of the Aeromonas genus. Microarray profiling of murine small intestinal extracts, 24 h after oral infection with an A. caviae strain, provides evidence of a Th1 type immune response. A large number of <e>gamma-interferon</e> (gamma-IFN) induced genes are up-regulated as well as several tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) transcripts. Aeromonas caviae has always been considered an opportunistic pathogen because it lacks obvious virulence factors. This current effort suggests that an A. caviae strain can colonize the murine intestinal tract and cause what has been described by others as a dysregulatory cytokine response. This response could explain why a number of diarrheal waterborne disease cases have been attributed to A. caviae even though it lacks obvious enteropathogenic properties.",M2
20130128,"Comparative measurement of cell-mediated immune responses of swine to the M and N proteins of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.The principal objectives of this study were to develop autologous antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and to characterize the antigen-specific T-cell responses to the M and N proteins of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) by using those APCs in outbred pigs. The orf6 and orf7 genes fused with porcine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were cloned into the mammalian expression vector to generate two plasmid DNAs, namely, pcDNA3.1-GM-CSF-PRRSV-M and pcDNA3.1-GM-CSF-PRRSV-N. Three of six pigs in two groups were repeatedly immunized with either plasmid DNA construct, and four pigs were used as controls. The recombinant M and N proteins fused with the protein transduction domain (PTD) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transactivator of transcription protein were employed to generate major histocompatibility complex-matched autologous APCs from each pig. The levels of T-cell proliferation and <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) synthesis were compared between pigs immunized with the two plasmid DNAs after stimulation of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of each pig with the autologous antigen-presenting dendritic cells and PBMCs. Higher levels of T-cell proliferation and IFN-gamma synthesis were identified in PBMCs isolated from the pigs immunized with pcDNA3.1-GM-CSF-PRRSV-M than in those isolated from the pigs immunized with pcDNA3.1-GM-CSF-PRRSV-N. By way of contrast, serum antibodies were detected only in pigs immunized with pcDNA3.1-GM-CSF-PRRSV-N. However, no T-cell response or antibody production was detected in the control pigs. These results suggest that the M protein of PRRSV is a more potent T cell-stimulating antigen than the N protein. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that the N protein substantially induces both cellular and humoral immune responses. The newly developed protocol for generating self APCs may prove effective in further efforts to characterize additional PRRSV proteins involved in the induction of cell-mediated immunity.",M2
20130066,"A chimeric alphavirus replicon particle vaccine expressing the hemagglutinin and fusion proteins protects juvenile and infant rhesus macaques from measles.Measles remains a major cause of child mortality, in part due to an inability to vaccinate young infants with the current live attenuated virus vaccine (LAV). To explore new approaches to infant vaccination, chimeric Venezuelan equine encephalitis/Sindbis virus (VEE/SIN) replicon particles were used to express the hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins of measles virus (MV). Juvenile rhesus macaques vaccinated intradermally with a single dose of VEE/SIN expressing H or H and F proteins (VEE/SIN-H or VEE/SIN-H+F, respectively) developed high titers of MV-specific neutralizing antibody and <e>gamma-interferon</e> (IFN-gamma)-producing T cells. Infant macaques vaccinated with two doses of VEE/SIN-H+F also developed neutralizing antibody and IFN-gamma-producing T cells. Control animals were vaccinated with LAV or with a formalin-inactivated measles vaccine (FIMV). Neutralizing antibody remained above the protective level for more than 1 year after vaccination with VEE/SIN-H, VEE/SIN-H+F, or LAV. When challenged with wild-type MV 12 to 17 months after vaccination, all vaccinated juvenile and infant monkeys vaccinated with VEE/SIN-H, VEE/SIN-H+F, and LAV were protected from rash and viremia, while FIMV-vaccinated monkeys were not. Antibody was boosted by challenge in all groups. T-cell responses to challenge were biphasic, with peaks at 7 to 25 days and at 90 to 110 days in all groups, except for the LAV group. Recrudescent T-cell activity coincided with the presence of MV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We conclude that VEE/SIN expressing H or H and F induces durable immune responses that protect from measles and offers a promising new approach for measles vaccination. The viral and immunological factors associated with long-term control of MV replication require further investigation.",M2
20130059,"Proliferation capacity and cytotoxic activity are mediated by functionally and phenotypically distinct virus-specific CD8 T cells defined by interleukin-7R{alpha} (CD127) and perforin expression.Cytotoxicity and proliferation capacity are key functions of antiviral CD8 T cells. In the present study, we investigated a series of markers to define these functions in virus-specific CD8 T cells. We provide evidence that there is a lack of coexpression of perforin and CD127 in human CD8 T cells. CD127 expression on virus-specific CD8 T cells correlated positively with proliferation capacity and negatively with perforin expression and cytotoxicity. Influenza virus-, cytomegalovirus-, and Epstein-Barr virus/human immunodeficiency virus type 1-specific CD8 T cells were predominantly composed of CD127(+) perforin(-)/CD127(-) perforin(+), and CD127(-)/perforin(-) CD8 T cells, respectively. CD127(-)/perforin(-) and CD127(-)/perforin(+) cells expressed significantly more PD-1 and CD57, respectively. Consistently, intracellular cytokine (<e>gamma interferon</e>, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-2 [IL-2]) responses combined to perforin detection confirmed that virus-specific CD8 T cells were mostly composed of either perforin(+)/IL-2(-) or perforin(-)/IL-2(+) cells. In addition, perforin expression and IL-2 secretion were negatively correlated in virus-specific CD8 T cells (P &lt; 0.01). As previously shown for perforin, changes in antigen exposure modulated also CD127 expression. Based on the above results, proliferating (CD127(+)/IL-2-secreting) and cytotoxic (perforin(+)) CD8 T cells were contained within phenotypically distinct T-cell populations at different stages of activation or differentiation and showed different levels of exhaustion and senescence. Furthermore, the composition of proliferating and cytotoxic CD8 T cells for a given antiviral CD8 T-cell population appeared to be influenced by antigen exposure. These results advance our understanding of the relationship between cytotoxicity, proliferation capacity, the levels of senescence and exhaustion, and antigen exposure of antiviral memory CD8 T cells.",M2
20123968,"<e>Gamma interferon</e>-dependent transcriptional memory via relocalization of a gene locus to PML nuclear bodies.Memory of past cellular responses is an essential adaptation to repeating environmental stimuli. We addressed the question of whether gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-inducible transcription generates memory that sensitizes cells to a second stimulus. We have found that the major histocompatibility complex class II gene DRA is relocated to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies upon induction with IFN-gamma, and this topology is maintained long after transcription shut off. Concurrent interaction of PML protein with mixed-lineage leukemia generates a prolonged permissive chromatin state on the DRA gene characterized by high promoter histone H3 K4 dimethylation that facilitates rapid expression upon restimulation. We propose that the primary signal-induced transcription generates spatial and epigenetic memory that is maintained through several cell generations and endows the cell with increased responsiveness to future activation signals.",M2
20123718,"Acute immune response to Mycobacterium massiliense in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice.Mycobacterium massiliense is an environmental opportunistic pathogen that has been associated with soft tissue infection after minor surgery. We studied the acute immune response of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice infected intravenously with 10(6) CFU of an M. massiliense strain isolated from a nosocomial infection in Brazil. The results presented here show that M. massiliense is virulent and pathogenic to both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, inducing a granulomatous inflammatory reaction that involves the activation of macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells induced by <e>gamma interferon</e> and interleukin-17 (IL-17) in C57BL/6 mice and by IL-12 in BALB/c mice.",M2
20123710,"Contribution of each of four Superantigens to Streptococcus equi-induced mitogenicity, <e>gamma interferon</e> synthesis, and immunity.Streptococcus equi is the causative agent of strangles, the most frequently diagnosed infectious disease of horses worldwide. The disease is characterized by abscessation and swelling of the lymph nodes of the head and neck, which can literally strangle the horse to death. S. equi produces four recently acquired phage-associated bacterial superantigens (sAgs; SeeH, SeeI, SeeL, and SeeM) that share homology with the mitogenic toxins of Streptococcus pyogenes. The aim of this study was to characterize the contribution of each of these S. equi sAgs to mitogenic activity in vitro and quantify the sAg-neutralizing capacity of sera from naturally infected horses in order to better understand their role in pathogenicity. Each of the sAgs was successfully cloned, and soluble proteins were produced in Escherichia coli. SeeI, SeeL, and SeeM induced a dose-dependent proliferative response in equine CD4 T lymphocytes and synthesis of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). SeeH did not stimulate equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) but induced proliferation of asinine PBMC. Allelic replacement mutants of S. equi strain 4047 with sequential deletion of the superantigen genes were generated. Deletion of seeI, seeL, and seeM completely abrogated the mitogenic activity and synthesis of IFN-gamma, in equine PBMC, of the strain 4047 culture supernatant. Sera from naturally infected convalescent horses had only limited sAg-neutralizing activities. We propose that S. equi sAgs play an important role in S. equi pathogenicity by stimulating an overzealous and inappropriate Th1 response that may interfere with the development of an effective immune response.",M2
20107020,"Virological footprint of CD4+ T-cell responses during chronic hepatitis C virus infection.Human and animal model evidence suggests that CD4+ T cells play a critical role in the control of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, despite their importance, the mechanism behind the failure of such populations in chronic disease is not understood and the contribution of viral mutation is not known. To address this, this study defined the specificity and virological footprint of CD4+ T cells in chronic infection. CD8+ T-cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 61 HCV genotype 1-infected patients were analysed against a panel of peptides covering the HCV genotype 1 core--a region where CD4+ T-cell responses may be reproducibly obtained. In parallel, the core region and E2 protein were sequenced. <e>Gamma interferon</e>-secreting CD4+ T-cell responses directed against multiple epitopes were detected in 53% of individuals, targeting between one and four peptides in the HCV core. Viral sequence evaluation revealed that these CD4+ T-cell responses were associated with mutants in 2/21 individuals. In these two cases, the circulating sequence variant was poorly recognized by host CD4+ T cells. Bioinformatics analyses revealed no overall evidence of selection in the target epitopes and no differences between the groups with and without detectable CD4+ T-cell responses. It was concluded that sustained core peptide-specific CD4+ T-cell responses may be reproducibly measured during chronic HCV infection and that immune escape may occur in specific instances. However, overall the virological impact of such responses is limited and other causes for CD4+ T-cell failure in HCV must be sought.",M2
20093762,"Comparative study of <e>gamma interferon</e> production in mice immunized with outer membrane proteins and whole bacteria of Brucella abortus.Brucella abortus is the intracellular bacterium that causes bovine brucellosis and a chronic human disease known as undulant fever. Interferon (IFN)-gamma plays critical roles in defending against intracellular bacterial infection. In this experiment, we demonstrated the difference in IFN-gamma production between the splenocytes of mice inoculated with outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of B. abortus and whole live bacteria. Our results showed that the OMP-inoculated group showed more IFN-gamma production than did the bacteria-infected group, suggesting that OMPs are candidates for the induction of immune response.",M2
20089651,"Extralymphoid CD8+ T cells resident in tissue from simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239{Delta}nef-vaccinated macaques suppress SIVmac239 replication ex vivo.Live-attenuated vaccination with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) SIVmac239Deltanef is the most successful vaccine product tested to date in macaques. However, the mechanisms that explain the efficacy of this vaccine remain largely unknown. We utilized an ex vivo viral suppression assay to assess the quality of the immune response in SIVmac239Deltanef-immunized animals. Using major histocompatibility complex-matched Mauritian cynomolgus macaques, we did not detect SIV-specific functional immune responses in the blood by <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunospot assay at select time points; however, we found that lung CD8(+) T cells, unlike blood CD8(+) T cells, effectively suppress virus replication by up to 80%. These results suggest that SIVmac239Deltanef may be an effective vaccine because it elicits functional immunity at mucosal sites. Moreover, these results underscore the limitations of relying on immunological measurements from peripheral blood lymphocytes in studies of protective immunity to HIV/SIV.",M2
20086091,"Role for parasite genetic diversity in differential host responses to Trypanosoma brucei infection.The postgenomic era has revolutionized approaches to defining host-pathogen interactions and the investigation of the influence of genetic variation in either protagonist upon infection outcome. We analyzed pathology induced by infection with two genetically distinct Trypanosoma brucei strains and found that pathogenesis is partly strain specific, involving distinct host mechanisms. Infections of BALB/c mice with one strain (927) resulted in more severe anemia and greater erythropoietin production compared to infections with the second strain (247), which, contrastingly, produced greater splenomegaly and reticulocytosis. Plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) and <e>gamma interferon</e> levels were significantly higher in strain 927-infected mice, whereas IL-12 was higher in strain 247-infected mice. To define mechanisms underlying these differences, expression microarray analysis of host genes in the spleen at day 10 postinfection was undertaken. Rank product analysis (RPA) showed that 40% of the significantly differentially expressed genes were specific to infection with one or the other trypanosome strain. RPA and pathway analysis identified LXR/RXR signaling, IL-10 signaling, and alternative macrophage activation as the most significantly differentially activated host processes. These data suggest that innate immune response modulation is a key determinant in trypanosome infections, the pattern of which can vary, dependent upon the trypanosome strain. This strongly suggests that a parasite genetic component is responsible for causing disease in the host. Our understanding of trypanosome infections is largely based on studies involving single parasite strains, and our results suggest that an integrated host-parasite approach is required for future studies on trypanosome pathogenesis. Furthermore, it is necessary to incorporate parasite variation into both experimental systems and models of pathogenesis.",M2
20086089,"Screening of predicted secreted antigens from Mycobacterium bovis reveals the immunodominance of the ESAT-6 protein family.Results of previous studies utilizing bioinformatic approaches in antigen-mining experiments revealed that secreted proteins are among the most frequently recognized antigens from Mycobacterium bovis. Thus, we hypothesized that the analysis of secreted proteins is likely to reveal additional immunogenic antigens that can be used to increase the specificity of diagnostic tests or be suitable vaccination candidates for mycobacterial infections. To test this hypothesis, 382 pools of overlapping peptides spanning 119 M. bovis secreted and potentially secreted proteins were screened for the ability to stimulate a <e>gamma interferon</e> response in vitro using whole blood from tuberculin-positive reactor (TB reactor) cattle. Of the 119 proteins screened, 70 (59%) induced positive responses in the TB reactor animals to various degrees. Strikingly, all but one of the 15 ESAT-6 proteins tested were recognized by at least 30% of the TB reactor animals, with 12 of the 22 most commonly recognized antigens belonging to this protein family. Further analysis of these data demonstrated that there was no significant difference in immunogenicity between the ESAT-6 proteins that were components of potentially intact ESX secretory systems and those corresponding to additional partial esx loci. Importantly for vaccine design, antigenic epitopes in some highly conserved regions shared by numerous ESAT-6 proteins were identified. However, despite this considerable homology, peptide-mapping experiments also revealed that immunodominant peptides were located in regions of amino acid variability.",M2
20086085,"Assessment of the duration of protection in Campylobacter jejuni experimental infection in humans.A human Campylobacter jejuni infection model provided controlled exposure to assess vaccine efficacy and investigate protective immunity for this important diarrheal pathogen. A well-characterized outbreak strain, C. jejuni 81-176, was investigated using a volunteer experimental infection model to evaluate the dose range and duration of protection. Healthy Campylobacter-seronegative adults received C. jejuni strain 81-176 via oral inoculation of 10(5), 10(7), or 10(9) CFU (5 adults/dose), which was followed by clinical and immunological monitoring. Based on dose range clinical outcomes, the 10(9)-CFU dose (n = 31) was used to assess homologous protection at 28 to 49 days (short-term veterans [STV]; n = 8) or 1 year (long-term veterans [LTV]; n = 7) after primary infection. An illness dose effect was observed for naïve subjects (with lower doses, 40 to 60% of the subjects were ill; with the 10(9)-CFU dose, 92% of the subjects were ill) along with complete protection for the STV group and attenuated illness for the LTV group (57%). Partial resistance to colonization was seen in STV (25% of the subjects were not infected; 3-log-lower maximum excretion level). Systemic and mucosal immune responses were robust in naïve subjects irrespective of the dose or the severity of illness. In contrast, in STV there was a lack of circulating antibody-secreting cells (ASC), reflecting the local mucosal effector responses. LTV exhibited comparable ASC responses to primary infection, and anamnestic fecal IgA responses likely contributed to self-resolving illness prior to antibiotic treatment. Campylobacter antigen-dependent production of <e>gamma interferon</e> by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was strongly associated with protection from illness, supporting the hypothesis that TH1 polarization has a primary role in acquired immunity to C. jejuni. This study revealed a C. jejuni dose-related increase in campylobacteriosis rates, evidence of complete short-term protection that waned with time, and immune response patterns associated with protection.",M2
20071569,"Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 has evolved <e>gamma interferon</e> and stat1-repressible promoters for the lytic switch gene 50.Cytokines regulate viral gene expression with important consequences for viral replication and pathogenesis. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is a key regulator of chronic murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (gammaHV68) infection and a potent inhibitor of gammaHV68 reactivation from latency. Macrophages are the cell type that is responsive to the IFN-gamma-mediated control of gammaHV68 reactivation; however, the molecular mechanism of this IFN-gamma action is undefined. Here we report that IFN-gamma inhibits lytic replication of gammaHV68 in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages and decreases transcript levels for the essential lytic switch gene 50. Interestingly, IFN-gamma suppresses the activity of the two known gene 50 promoters, demonstrating that an inflammatory cytokine can directly regulate the promoters for the gammaHV68 lytic switch gene. Stat1, but not IFN-alpha/beta signaling, is required for IFN-gamma action. Moreover, Stat1 deficiency increases basal gammaHV68 replication, gene 50 expression, and promoter activity. Together, these data identify IFN-gamma and Stat1 as being negative regulators of the gammaHV68 lytic cycle and raise the possibility that gammaHV68 maintains IFN-gamma/Stat1-responsive gene 50 promoters to facilitate cell-extrinsic control over the interchange between the lytic and latent cycles.",M2
20053743,"Characterization of a single-cycle rabies virus-based vaccine vector.Recombinant rabies virus (RV)-based vectors have demonstrated their efficacy in generating long-term, antigen-specific immune responses in murine and monkey models. However, replication-competent viral vectors pose significant safety concerns due to vector pathogenicity. RV pathogenicity is largely attributed to its glycoprotein (RV-G), which facilitates the attachment and entry of RV into host cells. We have developed a live, single-cycle RV by deletion of the G gene from an RV vaccine vector expressing HIV-1 Gag (SPBN-DeltaG-Gag). Passage of SPBN-DeltaG-Gag on cells stably expressing RV-G allowed efficient propagation of the G-deleted RV. The in vivo immunogenicity data comparing single-cycle RV to a replication-competent control (BNSP-Gag) showed lower RV-specific antibodies; however, the overall isotype profiles (IgG2a/IgG1) were similar for the two vaccine vectors. Despite this difference, mice immunized with SPBN-DeltaG-Gag and BNSP-Gag mounted similar levels of Gag-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses as measured by major histocompatibility complex class I Gag-tetramer staining, <e>gamma interferon</e>-enzyme-linked immunospot assay, and cytotoxic T-cell assay. Moreover, these cellular responses were maintained equally at immunization titers as low as 10(3) focus-forming units for both RV vaccine vectors. CD8(+) T-cell responses were significantly enhanced by a boost with a single-cycle RV complemented with a heterologous vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. These findings demonstrate that single-cycle RV is an effective alternative to replication-competent RV vectors for future development of vaccines for HIV-1 and other infectious diseases.",M2
20042510,"<e>Gamma interferon</e> signaling in oligodendrocytes is critical for protection from neurotropic coronavirus infection.Neurotropic coronavirus induces acute encephalomyelitis and demyelination in mice. Infection of BALB/c (H-2(d)) mice expressing a dominant negative gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) receptor specifically in oligodendrocytes was examined to determine the influence of IFN-gamma signaling on pathogenesis. Inhibition of IFN-gamma signaling in oligodendrocytes increased viral load, infection of oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, and axonal damage resulting in increased mortality. IFN-gamma levels and the inflammatory response were not altered, although the level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA was increased. These data indicate that IFN-gamma signaling by oligodendroglia reduces viral replication but affects both demyelination and tissue destruction in a host-specific manner.",M2
20036752,"Protection of BALB/c mice against Brucella melitensis 16 M infection induced by vaccination with live Escherchia coli expression Brucella P39 protein.The periplasmic binding protein (P39) antigen of Brucella melitensis 16 M was previously identified as Th1 dominant antigens. In this study, the potential for this antigen to function as vaccine against B. melitensis 16 M infection in BALB/c mice has been analyzed, and the humoral and cellular immune responses induced have been also characterized. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with live Escherichia coli alone or with that which express Brucella P39, two times at 4 weeks intervals. The live E. coli BL21 (DE3) pEt15b-p39 vaccine elicited a T-cell-proliferative response and also induced a <e>gamma interferon</e> production upon re-stimulation with either the bacterial extract or P39 as a specific antigen. Also the live E. coli BL21 (DE3) pEt15b-p39 vaccine has been found to induce a strong humoral response (IgG1 and IgG2a). Compared to the saline-inoculated control, vaccination of mice with E. coli BL21pEt15b-p39 at 3 weeks prior to the challenge infection, significantly reduced the number of strain 16 M bacteria in spleens at 4 and 8 weeks post-challenge infection in all vaccinated mice (p&lt;0.001).",M2
20032217,"Immunologic indicators of clinical progression during canine Leishmania infantum infection.In both dogs and humans Leishmania infantum infection is more prevalent than disease, as infection often does not equate with clinical disease. Previous studies additively indicate that advanced clinical visceral leishmaniasis is characterized by increased production of anti-Leishmania antibodies, Leishmania-specific lymphoproliferative unresponsiveness, and decreased production of <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) with a concomitant increase of interleukin-10 (IL-10). In order to differentiate infection versus progressive disease for better disease prognostication, we temporally evaluated humoral and cellular immunologic parameters of naturally infected dogs. The work presented here describes for the first time the temporal immune response to natural autochthonous L. infantum infection in foxhounds within the United States. Several key changes in immunological parameters should be considered when differentiating infection versus clinical disease, including a dramatic rise in IgG production, progressive increases in antigen-specific peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation, and IFN-gamma production. Polysymptomatic disease is precluded by increased IL-10 production and consistent detection of parasite kinetoplast DNA in whole blood. This clinical presentation and the immuno-dysregulation mirror those observed in human patients, indicating that this animal model will be very useful for testing immunomodulatory anti-IL-10 and other therapies.",M2
20032177,"Multi-low-dose mucosal simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239 challenge of cynomolgus macaques immunized with  hyperattenuated  SIV constructs.Hyperattenuated simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239-derived constructs Delta5-CMV and Delta6-CCI are an effort to render SIV incapable of, in practical terms, both reversion and recombination while maintaining the immune features of SIV as a retrovirus. Primary inoculation of cynomolgus macaques with 10(8) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID(50)) of Delta5-CMV or Delta6-CCI induced low-level humoral and cellular responses detectable in the absence of measureable in vivo replication. The first of three DNA boosts resulted in elevated <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) responses to Gag, Pol, and Env in the Delta5-CMV vaccine group compared to the Delta6-CCI vaccine group (P = 0.001). Weekly intrarectal challenge with a low dose of SIVmac239 followed by a dose escalation was conducted until all animals became infected. The mean peak viral load of the Delta5-CMV-vaccinated animals (3.7 x 10(5) copies/ml) was approximately 1 log unit lower than that of the control animals. More dramatically, the viral load set point of these animals was decreased by 3 log units compared to that of the controls (&lt;50 versus 1.64 x 10(4) copies/ml; P &lt; 0.0001). Seventy-five percent (6/8) of vaccine recipients controlled virus below 1,000 copies/ml for at least 6 months, with a subset controlling virus and maintaining substantial CD4 T-cell counts for close to 2 years of follow-up. The correlates of protection from SIV disease progression may lie in the rapidity and protective value of immune responses that occur early in primary SIV infection. Prior immunization with hyperattenuated SIVmac239, even if sterilizing immunity is not achieved, may allow a more advantageous host response.",M2
20026449,"Oral immunization with a novel lipid-based adjuvant protects against genital Chlamydia infection.Oral immunization is attractive as a delivery route because it is needle-free and useful for rapid mass vaccination programs to target pandemics or bioterrorism. This potential has not been realized for human vaccination, due to the requirement of large antigen doses and toxic (to humans) adjuvants to overcome the induction of oral tolerance and potential degradation of antigens in the stomach. To date, only oral vaccines based on live attenuated organisms have been approved for human use. In this study we describe the use of a lipid-based delivery system/adjuvant, Lipid C, for oral immunization to protect mice against genital tract chlamydial infection. Lipid C is formulated from food-grade purified and fractionated triglycerides. Bacterial shedding following vaginal challenge with Chlamydia muridarum was reduced by 50% in female mice orally immunized with the chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP) formulated in Lipid C, protection equivalent to that seen in animals immunized with MOMP admixed with both cholera toxin (CT) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN). Protection was further enhanced when MOMP, CT and CpG were all combined in the Lipid C matrix. Protection correlated with production of <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN) by splenic T cells, a serum MOMP-specific IgG response and low but detectable levels of MOMP-specific IgA in vaginal lavage.",M2
20016043,"Francisella tularensis T-cell antigen identification using humanized HLA-DR4 transgenic mice.There is no licensed vaccine against the intracellular pathogen Francisella tularensis. The use of conventional mouse strains to screen protective vaccine antigens may be problematic, given the differences in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding properties between murine and human antigen-presenting cells. We used engineered humanized mice that lack endogenous MHC class II alleles but that express a human HLA allele (HLA-DR4 transgenic [tg] mice) to identify potential subunit vaccine candidates. Specifically, we applied a biochemical and immunological screening approach with bioinformatics to select putative F. tularensis subsp. novicida T-cell-reactive antigens using humanized HLA-DR4 tg mice. Cell wall- and membrane-associated proteins were extracted with Triton X-114 detergent and were separated by fractionation with a Rotofor apparatus and whole-gel elution. A series of proteins were identified from fractions that stimulated antigen-specific <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) production, and these were further downselected by the use of bioinformatics and HLA-DR4 binding algorithms. We further examined the validity of this combinatorial approach with one of the identified proteins, a 19-kDa Francisella tularensis outer membrane protein (designated Francisella outer membrane protein B [FopB]; FTN_0119). FopB was shown to be a T-cell antigen by a specific IFN-gamma recall assay with purified CD4(+) T cells from F. tularensis subsp. novicida DeltaiglC-primed HLA-DR4 tg mice and cells of a human B-cell line expressing HLA-DR4 (DRB1*0401) functioning as antigen-presenting cells. Intranasal immunization of HLA-DR4 tg mice with the single antigen FopB conferred significant protection against lethal pulmonary challenge with an F. tularensis subsp. holarctica live vaccine strain. These results demonstrate the value of combining functional biochemical and immunological screening with humanized HLA-DR4 tg mice to map HLA-DR4-restricted Francisella CD4(+) T-cell epitopes.",M2
20016042,"Cellular immune responses of preterm infants after vaccination with whole-cell or acellular pertussis vaccines.Based on studies reporting specific antibody titers, it is recommended to vaccinate preterm infants against Bordetella pertussis according to their chronological age. However, as specific T-cell responses also are involved in the protection against B. pertussis, we have determined whether highly preterm infants (&lt;31 weeks) are able to mount these immune responses during vaccination. Forty-eight premature infants were vaccinated at 2, 3, and 4 months of their chronological age with an acellular (Pa; n = 24) or a whole-cell (Pw; n = 24) tetravalent diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-polio vaccine, and blood samples were collected at 2, 3, and 6 months of age. Most of the Pa- and Pw-vaccinated infants developed at 3 or 6 months of age a <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) response to the B. pertussis antigens, accompanied by an interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13 secretion for the Pa-vaccinated infants. No association was found between a very low infant birth weight, the occurrence of severe infections, and corticosteroid treatment or the administration of gammaglobulins with a low level of antigen-induced IFN-gamma secretion. We conclude that like full-term infants, most preterm infants are able to mount a specific cellular immune response to the administration of the first doses of an acellular or a whole-cell pertussis vaccine.",M2
20007361,"Immune responses in cattle inoculated with Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or Mycobacterium kansasii.Cattle were inoculated with Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or Mycobacterium kansasii to compare the antigen-specific immune responses to various patterns of mycobacterial disease. Disease expression ranged from colonization with associated pathology (M. bovis infection) and colonization without pathology (M. tuberculosis infection) to no colonization or pathology (M. kansasii infection). Delayed-type hypersensitivity and <e>gamma interferon</e> responses were elicited by each mycobacterial inoculation; however, the responses by the M. bovis- and M. tuberculosis-inoculated animals exceeded those of the M. kansasii-inoculated animals. Specific antibody responses were detected in all M. tuberculosis- and M. bovis-inoculated cattle 3 weeks after inoculation. From 6 to 16 weeks after M. tuberculosis inoculation, the antibody responses waned, whereas the responses persisted with M. bovis infection. With M. kansasii inoculation, initial early antibody responses waned by 10 weeks after inoculation and then increased 2 weeks after the injection of purified protein derivative for the skin test at 18 weeks after challenge. These findings indicate that antibody responses are associated with the antigen burden rather than the pathology, cellular immune responses to tuberculin correlate with infection but not necessarily with the pathology or bacterial burden, and exposure to mycobacterial antigens may elicit an antibody response in a presensitized animal.",M2
20007270,"Heterotypic humoral and cellular immune responses following Norwalk virus infection.Norovirus immunity is poorly understood as the limited data available on protection after infection are often contradictory. In contrast to the more prominent GII noroviruses, GI norovirus infections are less frequent in outbreaks. The GI noroviruses display very complex patterns of heterotypic immune responses following infection, and many individuals are highly susceptible to reinfection. To study the immune responses and mechanisms of GI.1 persistence, we built structural models and recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) of five GI strains: GI.1-1968, GI.1-2001, GI.2-1999, GI.3-1999, and GI.4-2000. Structural models of four GI genotype capsid P domain dimers suggested that intragenotype structural variation is limited, that the GI binding pocket is mostly preserved between genotypes, and that a conserved, surface-exposed epitope may allow for highly cross-reactive immune responses. GI VLPs bound to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) including fucose, Lewis, and A antigens. Volunteers infected with GI.1-1968 (n = 10) had significant increases between prechallenge and convalescent reactive IgG for all five GI VLPs measured by enzyme immunoassay. Potential cross-neutralization of GI VLPs was demonstrated by convalescent-phase serum cross-blockade of GI VLP-HBGA interaction. Although group responses were significant for all GI VLPs, each individual volunteer demonstrated a unique VLP blockade pattern. Further, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with each of the VLPs, and secretion of <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) was measured. As seen with blockade responses, IFN-gamma secretion responses differed by individual. Sixty percent responded to at least one GI VLP, with only two volunteers responding to GI.1 VLP. Importantly, four of five individuals with sufficient PBMCs for cross-reactivity studies responded more robustly to other GI VLPs. These data suggest that preexposure history and deceptive imprinting may complicate PBMC and B-cell immune responses in some GI.1-1968-challenged individuals and highlight a potential complication in the design of efficacious norovirus vaccines.",M2
19954364,"Role of caspase 8 as a determinant in trail sensitivity of neuroblastoma cell lines.OBJECTIVE: Resistance of neuroblastoma (NB) cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis is thought to be caused by loss of caspase 8 expression. The aim of this study is to investigate if induction of caspase 8 by <e>gamma-interferon</e> (IFN gamma) renders NB cells sensitive to TRAIL. METHODS: Caspase 8 expression was monitored by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The effects of IFN gamma, TRAIL, IFN gamma + TRAIL, and caspase 8 inhibitor + TRAIL on the growth and apoptosis of NB cells were detected with the methods of reduction rate of Alamar blue assay and flow cytometry. The relative caspase 8 activity was measured with colorimetric assay. RESULTS: An increased expression of caspase 8 mRNA and protein was found after treatment with IFN gamma. IFN gamma in combination with TRAIL decreased proliferation of NB cell line SH-SY5Y cells. The killing effect of TRAIL on NB cells expressing caspase 8 was depressed by caspase 8 inhibitor. The relative caspase 8 activity of NB cells expressing caspase 8 increased with the prolongation of TRAIL action time. CONCLUSIONS: TRAIL induced apoptosis in NB cells expressing caspase 8.",M2
19947939,"Treatment with IFN-gamma prevents insulin-dependent PKB, p70S6k phosphorylation and protein synthesis in mouse C2C12 myogenic cells.The purpose of the present study was to examine the potential effect of IFN-gamma (<e>interferon-gamma</e>) on the cellular content and phosphorylation of PKB (protein kinase B), p70S6k (p70 S6 kinase) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), and on the ability of insulin to stimulate the glucose uptake and protein synthesis in mouse C2C12 myotubes. Insulin (100 nmol/l) stimulated glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes by 203.4%. Glucose uptake in cells differentiated in the presence of IFN-gamma (10 ng/ml) was increased by 165.8% and was not further significantly modified by the addition of insulin (183.4% of control value). Insulin increased the rate of protein synthesis by 198.8%. The basal rate of protein synthesis was not affected by IFN-gamma; however, this cytokine abolished the insulin effect. Cellular levels of PKB, p70S6k, p42MAPK and p44MAPK were not modified by IFN-gamma. Insulin caused the phosphorylation of PKB and the activation of p70S6k, but not p42MAPK and p44MAPK. In cells differentiated in the presence of IFN-gamma, the insulin-mediated PKB phosphorylation was significantly diminished, whereas the phosphorylation of p70S6k was completely prevented. Pretreatment of C2C12 myogenic cells with IFN-gamma led to the marked increase in p42MAPK phosphorylation. Exposure of C2C12 myoblasts to IFN-gamma impaired MyoD and myogenin expression and decreased the fusion index on the fifth day of differentiation. In conclusion, (i) IFN-gamma present in the extracellular environment during C2C12 myoblast differentiation prevents the stimulatory action of insulin on protein synthesis; (ii) IFN-gamma-induced insulin resistance of protein synthesis in myogenic cells can be associated with the decreased phosphorylation of PKB and p70S6k, as well as with the augmented basal phosphorylation of p42MAPK; (iii) this cytokine effect can be partly explained by alterations in the differentiation process.",M2
19944759,"Intracellular IFNgamma production in CD3 negative cells exposed to allo-antigens is an indicator of prior sensitization.BACKGROUND: Sensitization to HLA antigens (Ags) is a significant obstacle to kidney transplantation and risk factor for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). Current screening methods to assess HLA Ag exposure include various antibody assays. However, tools to accurately measure cell-mediated immunity to allo-Ags in a clinical setting are lacking. Here we report on an intracellular cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) assay that detects intracellular <e>gamma-interferon</e> (IFNgamma) production in non-T cell populations (CD3-) that appears to assess sensitization from previous allo-Ag exposure. METHODS: Blood from 106 highly-HLA sensitized (HS) patients (pre-, post-IVIG-treatment [Rx] and/or post-transplant) and 14 3(rd) party normal controls (3(rd)N) were incubated with donor or 3(rd)N peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and IFNgamma+/CD3- cells were enumerated. RESULTS: The percentage of IFNgamma+ cells in CD3- cells without stimulation in pre-IVIG-Rx HS patients was similar to normals, but significantly increased with incubation with donor and/or 3(rd)N PBMCs. Reactivity in normals was minimal. Reactivity was higher in HS females than HS males. Normal females with previous pregnancy (PG) showed significantly higher response than females without PG or non-sensitized normal males. Donor-specific reactivity in the CFC assay better correlated with donor-specific B cell crossmatch than total anti-HLA antibody levels or PRA. HS patients who developed AMR post-transplant showed significantly higher reactivity than those without AMR. CONCLUSIONS: The CFC assay measures IFNgamma production in CD3- cells that may indicate a memory response to allo-Ags. This response is limited to HS patients and normal females with previous PG. Patients undergoing AMR show significantly higher reactivity. This assay may represent a novel approach to measurement of allo-sensitization with clinical utility in predicting those at risk for AMR.",M2
19932674,"Augmented humoral and cellular immune response of hepatitis B virus DNA vaccine by micro-needle vaccination using Flt3L as an adjuvant.The purpose of this work was to assess the immune response against plasmid DNA encoding hepatitis B virus (HBV) HBsAg in C57BL/6 mice inoculated by micro-needle. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), a hematopoietic growth factor, was used as an adjuvant. Immune response was determined by analysis of cytokine production. In addition, cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) activity was measured 7 days after in vitro addition of tumor cells (CT26/S) stabling expressing HBsAg. The efficacy of immunoprotection against CT26/S was determined by antibody response to this challenge. A strong antibody response was induced by inoculation with the DNA vaccine via micro-needles assisted with Flt3L, Administration of the vaccine to splenocytes induced significantly higher levels of interleukin-12 and <e>gamma interferon</e>. CTL response to the vaccine was stronger than that stimulated by intramuscular or micro-needle injections alone. Our study suggests useful strategies for improving the efficacy of vaccines against HBV and other pathogens.",M2
19928918,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, an immunomodulatory protein, is suppressed by (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate via blocking of <e>gamma-interferon</e>-induced JAK-PKC-delta-STAT1 signaling in human oral cancer cells.Immune escape is a characteristic of cancer progression, but its underlying molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. An immunomodulatory protein, indoleamide 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), is induced by gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) in several immune cells; those cells are observed in cancer cell microenvironment and can enhance immune escape. Previous studies show that IDO is expressed in the process of tumor formation and associated with cancer cell immune tolerance. By locally degrading tryptophan, IDO inhibits the proliferation of T lymphocytes and induces T cell apoptosis, leading to suppression of T cell response. In this study, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major constituent of green tea, is found to significantly inhibit the expression of IDO in human oral cancer cell lines. EGCG suppresses the induction of IDO at transcriptional level. Activation of STAT1 is discovered to play an important role in regulating IDO expression by IFN-gamma. The study results demonstrate that EGCG can inhibit translocation of STAT1 into nucleus in IFN-gamma-stimulated human oral cancer cells. In addition, both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 are revealed to be suppressed by EGCG. Moreover, phosphorylation of PKC-delta, JAK-1, and JAK-2, which are the upstream event for the activation of STAT1, are also inhibited by EGCG in IFN-gamma-stimulated human oral cancer cells. These data show that EGCG inhibited IDO expression by blocking the IFN-gamma-induced JAK-PKC-delta-STAT1 signaling pathway. This study indicates that EGCG is a potential drug for immune and target therapy to enhance cancer therapy by increasing antitumor immunity.",M2
19923572,"Recrudescent Campylobacter jejuni infection in an immunocompetent adult following experimental infection with a well-characterized organism.The recrudescence of infection with Campylobacter jejuni after appropriate antibiotic treatment has not been previously reported in an immunocompetent adult. We present the complete clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic evaluation of a closely monitored healthy male with recrudescent C. jejuni infection occurring in the absence of immunodeficiency following experimental infection with a well-characterized strain. After antibiotic treatment, the initial infection was clinically cleared and microbiologically undetectable. Subsequently, two episodes of recrudescence occurred, with no change in in vitro antibiotic sensitivity being detected. The immune responses of the individual were compared to those of other participants in the experimental infection study: innate immune responses, including fecal cytokines and C-reactive protein, were intact; however, measures of Campylobacter-specific adaptive immune responses were absent, including serum antibodies, antibody-secreting cells, and in vitro <e>gamma interferon</e> responses. No primary or secondary immunodeficiency was identified. Recrudescent Campylobacter infections after treatment may be more common than has previously been appreciated. This work adds to our understanding of the human immune response to natural Campylobacter infection and reiterates the importance of pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses to this globally important pathogen.",M2
19923568,"Identification of immune parameters to differentiate disease states among sheep infected with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis.Johne's disease, a chronic enteritis of ruminants, is caused by infection with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Three distinct forms have been observed in sheep: paucibacillary disease (PB), multibacillary disease (MB), and asymptomatic infection (AS). In this study, immune parameters for animals naturally infected with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and identified postmortem as having PB, MB, or AS were compared to provide a further understanding of the immunological reactivity contributing to or resulting from these different disease states in sheep. PB was associated with strong ex vivo M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis antigen-stimulated <e>gamma interferon</e> responses, pronounced increases in CD25(+) T-cell frequencies in circulation, antibody production, and a B-cell population that expanded significantly upon ex vivo antigenic stimulation. The MB group featured the highest antibody levels and a lack of cellular immune responsiveness to the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis antigen. The AS group expressed an immunological phenotype intermediate between that for noninfected control animals and that for the PB group. The relationship between immune responses and disease severity within the PB group was investigated more closely; significant positive correlations were observed between disease severity and both the CD8(+) population in the circulating blood and the expression of interleukin-4 mRNA in antigen-stimulated blood samples ex vivo. Together, these data point toward distinct immune profiles in sheep that correspond to different Johne's disease states, which can be determined from circulating blood and/or from localized intestinal tract tissue samples.",M2
19923492,"Diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis by using a whole-blood <e>gamma interferon</e> release assay.Congenital toxoplasmosis in newborns is generally subclinical, but infected infants are at risk of developing ocular lesions. Diagnosis at birth relies mainly on serological tests. Cell-mediated immunity plays the major role in resistance to infection but is not routinely investigated for diagnostic purposes. Here, we describe a simple test based on the gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) response after stimulation of whole blood by crude parasitic antigens. One milliliter of heparinized blood was centrifuged; plasma was kept for routine serological tests, and pellets were resuspended in culture medium. After 24 h of culture in the presence of crude Toxoplasma gondii antigen, the cells were centrifuged and the supernatant was assayed for IFN-gamma. For 62 infants under 1 year of age born to mothers who were infected during pregnancy, the sensitivity and specificity of the test were 94% (with positive results for 16 of 17 infected infants) and 98% (with negative results for 44 of 45 uninfected infants), respectively. The false-negative result was for a treated baby who gave positive results after the withdrawal of treatment. The false positive was obtained for a 3-month-old baby. For a cohort of 124 congenitally infected patients between 1 and 30 years of age, the sensitivity of the assay was 100%. We present a simple test based on IFN-gamma secretion to assess cell-mediated immunity in toxoplasmosis. As only 1 ml of blood is required to investigate humoral and cellular immunity, our assay is well adapted for the study of congenital toxoplasmosis in infants. Using purified antigens or recombinant peptides may improve the test performance.",M2
19923181,"Characterization of T-cell responses in macaques immunized with a single dose of HIV DNA vaccine.The optimization of immune responses (IR) induced by HIV DNA vaccines in humans is one of the great challenges in the development of an effective vaccine against AIDS. Ideally, this vaccine should be delivered in a single dose to immunize humans. We recently demonstrated that the immunization of mice with a single dose of a DNA vaccine derived from pathogenic SHIV(KU2) (Delta4SHIV(KU2)) induced long-lasting, potent, and polyfunctional HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses (G. Arrode, R. Hegde, A. Mani, Y. Jin, Y. Chebloune, and O. Narayan, J. Immunol. 178:2318-2327, 2007). In the present work, we expanded the characterization of the IR induced by this DNA immunization protocol to rhesus macaques. Animals immunized with a single high dose of Delta4SHIV(KU2) DNA vaccine were monitored longitudinally for vaccine-induced IR using multiparametric flow cytometry-based assays. Interestingly, all five immunized macaques developed broad and polyfunctional HIV-specific T-cell IR that persisted for months, with an unusual reemergence in the blood following an initial decline but in the absence of antibody responses. The majority of vaccine-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells lacked <e>gamma interferon</e> production but showed high antigen-specific proliferation capacities. Proliferative CD8(+) T cells expressed the lytic molecule granzyme B. No integrated viral vector could be detected in mononuclear cells from immunized animals, and this high dose of DNA did not induce any detectable autoimmune responses against DNA. Taken together, our comprehensive analysis demonstrated for the first time the capacity of a single high dose of HIV DNA vaccine alone to induce long-lasting and polyfunctional T-cell responses in the nonhuman primate model, bringing new insights for the design of future HIV vaccines.",M2

19906941,"Beta interferon plus <e>gamma interferon</e> efficiently reduces acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus infection in mice in a T-cell-independent manner.Acyclovir (ACV)-resistant herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) causes severe diseases in immunocompromised patients, so identification of new therapies is needed. Interferons (IFNs) are used to treat several other viral infections in the clinic, and IFN-beta and IFN-gamma are known to cooperatively reduce wild-type HSV-1 replication in the corneas of immunocompetent mice. Because IFN-gamma has been shown to exert an antiviral effect mostly through T cells, whether combined IFN treatment can still inhibit ACV-resistant HSV-1 replication, especially in immunocompromised hosts, is unknown. The present study evaluated the efficacy of combined IFN treatment on ACV-resistant HSV-1 mutants. In vitro results showed that IFN-beta acted synergistically with IFN-gamma to inhibit HSV-1 replication in both human and mouse cell lines. Some ACV-resistant mutants were actually hypersensitive to combined IFN treatment. In vivo results showed that topical treatment with a low dose of IFN-beta plus IFN-gamma (200 U each) on mouse corneas efficiently reduced the viral loads by up to 4, 4 and 3 logs, respectively, in the eyes, trigeminal ganglia and brainstems of wild-type and also immunocompromised nude mice infected or co-infected with ACV-resistant HSV-1 in a manner independent of T cells. A highly efficient reduction in HSV acute replication by combined IFN treatment led to a dramatic decrease in subsequent virus reactivation from neural tissues, trigeminal ganglia, brainstems and spinal cords of latently infected mice. Thus, a combination of IFN-beta and IFN-gamma could be a potential treatment for ACV-resistant HSV-1 in immunocompromised patients.",M2
19875977,"<e>Gamma interferon</e>-mediated superinduction of B7-H1 in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma: a paradoxical mechanism of immune evasion.B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1) is a recently discovered immunoresistance protein that is regulated posttranscriptionally after PTEN loss in malignant glioma, a deadly form of brain tumor. Here, the impact of gamma-interferon-mediated activation of B7-H1 was investigated in glioblastoma patients with PTEN loss. Lymphocytes and T cells were selected for apoptosis assays after 1 : 1 coculture with autologous glioma cells. Gamma interferon treatment of PTEN-deficient tumors resulted in superinduction of B7-H1 protein that correlated with increased T-cell apoptosis, an effect dependent upon activation of the PI3-kinase pathway. The combination of PTEN loss and gamma-interferon exposure in glioblastoma patients results in an exceptionally immunoresistant phenotype that may negate adaptive immunity through induction of T-cell apoptosis.",M2
19864487,"Intranasal immunization of mice with a bovine respiratory syncytial virus vaccine induces superior immunity and protection compared to those by subcutaneous delivery or combinations of intranasal and subcutaneous prime-boost strategies.Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infects cells of the respiratory mucosa, so it is desirable to develop a vaccination strategy that induces mucosal immunity. To achieve this, various delivery routes were compared for formalin-inactivated (FI) BRSV formulated with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and polyphosphazene (PP). Intranasal delivery of the FI-BRSV formulation was superior to subcutaneous delivery in terms of antibody, cell-mediated, and mucosal immune responses, as well as reduction in virus replication after BRSV challenge. Although intranasal delivery of FI-BRSV also induced higher serum and lung antibody titers and <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) production in the lungs than intranasal-subcutaneous and/or subcutaneous-intranasal prime-boost strategies, no significant differences were observed in cell-mediated immune responses or virus replication in the lungs of challenged mice. Interleukin 5 (IL-5), eotaxin, and eosinophilia were enhanced after BRSV challenge in the lungs of subcutaneously immunized mice compared to unvaccinated mice, but not in the lungs of mice immunized intranasally or through combinations of the intranasal and subcutaneous routes. These results suggest that two intranasal immunizations with FI-BRSV formulated with CpG ODN and PP are effective and safe as an approach to induce systemic and mucosal responses, as well to reduce virus replication after BRSV challenge. Furthermore, intranasal-subcutaneous and subcutaneous-intranasal prime-boost strategies were also safe and almost as efficacious. In addition to the implications for the development of a protective BRSV vaccine for cattle, formulation with CpG ODN and PP could also prove important in the development of a mucosal vaccine that induces protective immunity against human RSV.",M2
19858302,"Impairment of <e>gamma interferon</e> signaling in human neutrophils infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum.Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agent of tick-borne human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), is an intracellular bacterium which survives and multiplies inside polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMN). Increased bacterial burden in gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-deficient mice suggested a major role of IFN-gamma in the control of A. phagocytophilum. Here we investigated whether infection of human PMN with A. phagocytophilum impairs IFN-gamma signaling thus facilitating intracellular survival of the bacterium. The secretion of the IFN-gamma-inducible chemokines IP-10/CXCL10 and MIG/CXCL9 was markedly inhibited in infected neutrophils. Molecular analyses revealed that, compared to uninfected PMN, A. phagocytophilum decreased the expression of the IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain CD119, diminished the IFN-gamma-induced phosphorylation of STAT1, and enhanced the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in PMN. Since IFN-gamma activates various antibacterial effector mechanisms of PMN, the impaired IFN-gamma signaling in infected cells likely contributes to the survival of A. phagocytophilum inside PMN and to HGA disease development.",M2
19846681,"Monocyte-derived interleukin-10 depresses the Bordetella pertussis- specific <e>gamma interferon</e> response in vaccinated infants.Antigen-specific gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) has been demonstrated to participate in protection against Bordetella pertussis infection. Circulating mononuclear cells from B. pertussis-infected and from pertussis-vaccinated infants secrete high amounts of IFN-gamma after in vitro stimulation by B. pertussis antigens, but with a large variation in the secreted IFN-gamma levels between individuals. We show here that the inhibition of the specific IFN-gamma response can be at least partially attributed to IL-10 secretion by monocytes. This IL-10 secretion was not associated with polymorphisms at positions -1082, -819, and -592 of the IL-10 gene promoter, suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors affect IL-10 expression and secretion.",M2

19845536,"Immune hierarchy among HIV-1 CD8+ T cell epitopes delivered by dendritic cells depends on MHC-I binding irrespective of mode of loading and immunization in HLA-A*0201 mice.Recent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccination strategies aim at targeting a broad range of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes from different HIV-1 proteins by immunization with multiple CTL epitopes simultaneously. However, this may establish an immune hierarchical response, where the immune system responds to only a small number of the epitopes administered. To evaluate the feasibility of such vaccine strategies, we used the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201 transgenic (tg) HHD murine in vivo model and immunized with dendritic cells pulsed with seven HIV-1-derived HLA-A*0201 binding CTL epitopes. The seven peptides were simultaneously presented on the same dendritic cell (DC) or on separate DCs before immunization to one or different lymphoid compartments. Data from this study showed that the T-cell response, as measured by cytolytic activity and <e>gamma-interferon</e> (IFN-gamma)-producing CD8(+) T cells, mainly focused on two of seven administered epitopes. The magnitude of individual T-cell responses induced by immunization with multiple peptides correlated with their individual immunogenicity that depended on major histocompatibility class I binding and was not influenced by mode of loading or mode of immunization. These findings may have implications for the design of vaccines based on DCs when using multiple epitopes simultaneously.",M2
19837843,"Bacterial polyester inclusions engineered to display vaccine candidate antigens for use as a novel class of safe and efficient vaccine delivery agents.Bioengineered bacterial polyester inclusions have the potential to be used as a vaccine delivery system. The biopolyester beads were engineered to display a fusion protein of the polyester synthase PhaC and the two key antigens involved in immune response to the infectious agent that causes tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, notably antigen 85A (Ag85A) and the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Polyester beads displaying the respective fusion protein at a high density were successfully produced (henceforth called Ag85A-ESAT-6 beads) by recombinant Escherichia coli. The ability of the Ag85A-ESAT-6 beads to enhance mouse immunity to the displayed antigens was investigated. The beads were not toxic to the animals, as determined by weight gain and absence of lesions at the inoculation site in immunized animals. In vivo injection of the Ag85A-ESAT-6 beads in mice induced significant humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to both Ag85A and ESAT-6. Vaccination with Ag85A-ESAT-6 beads was efficient at stimulating immunity on their own, and this ability was enhanced by administration of the beads in an oil-in-water emulsion. In addition, vaccination with the Ag85A-ESAT-6 beads induced significantly stronger humoral and cell-mediated immune responses than vaccination with an equivalent dose of the fusion protein Ag85A-ESAT-6 alone. The immune response induced by the beads was of a mixed Th1/Th2 nature, as assessed from the induction of the cytokine <e>gamma interferon</e> (Th1 immune response) and increased levels of immunoglobulin G1 (Th2 immune response). Hence, engineered biopolyester beads displaying foreign antigens represent a new class of versatile, safe, and biocompatible vaccines.",M2
19822654,"12/15-lipoxygenase-dependent myeloid production of interleukin-12 is essential for resistance to chronic toxoplasmosis.Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is critical for resistance to Toxoplasma gondii during both the acute and chronic stages of infection. However, the cellular and molecular pathways that regulate IL-12 production during chronic toxoplasmosis are incompletely defined. We recently discovered that 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX), which oxidizes unsaturated lipids in macrophages, is a novel and selective regulator of IL-12 production. We now demonstrate the essential role of this enzyme in the chronic phase of toxoplasmosis. Although 12/15-LOX-deficient mice were resistant to acute T. gondii infection, 80% of 12/15-LOX-deficient mice died during chronic toxoplasmosis, compared to no deaths in wild-type controls. The morbidity of chronically infected 12/15-LOX mice was associated with an increase in brain inflammation and parasite burden. These data suggest that the evolution of the immune response to T. gondii is accompanied by an increasing requirement for 12/15-LOX-mediated signaling. Consistent with this conclusion, 12/15-LOX activity was enhanced during chronic, but not acute, toxoplasmosis. Furthermore, the enhanced susceptibility of 12/15-LOX-deficient mice to chronic toxoplasmosis was associated with reduced production of IL-12 and <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) that was not evident during acute infection. Importantly, ex vivo IFN-gamma production by 12/15-LOX-deficient splenocytes could be rescued by the addition of recombinant IL-12. These data establish that 12/15-LOX is a critical mediator of the chronic type 1 inflammatory response and that immune mediators can be subject to distinct cellular and/or molecular mechanisms of regulation at different stages of inflammation.",M2
19819213,"The use of a <e>Gamma-Interferon</e> assay to confirm a diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in Brazil.Control of bovine tuberculosis (TB) is currently based on slaughter of cattle deemed positive on the basis of tuberculin testing; although the test has been broadly used for several years, there are some disadvantages such as the need for holding animals for 72 h. Besides it, test can lack both sensitivity and specificity depending on the interpretation and the site of the PPD inoculation. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the use of the Gamma-Interferon (IFN) assay as a confirmatory test in Brazil. A Comparative Intradermal Tuberculin Test (CITT) was performed in 50 cows from a dairy herd known to be infected with TB. Blood samples for IFN testing were collected concurrent with the CITT, as well as seven and 21 days later. At 30 days after the CITT, all cattle deemed reactive to this test were slaughtered and samples were processed by both bacteriological culture and PCR. The sensitivity of IFN as a diagnostic tool was 91.4%, whereas specificity was 86.7%. When applied seven or 21 days after injection of PPD, sensitivity was 74.3 and 71.4%, respectively, whereas specificity was 86.7 and 80%. There was no significant difference between the reliability of the IFN assay and the other standards, on all three days of sampling. Therefore, we concluded that the IFN assay could be effectively used as a confirmatory test seven or 21 days after injection of PPD.",M2
19812258,"DNA vaccination by electroporation and boosting with recombinant proteins enhances the efficacy of DNA vaccines for Schistosomiasis japonica.Schistosomiasis japonica is an endemic, zoonotic disease of major public health importance in China. Control programs combining chemotherapy and snail killing have not been able to block transmission of infection in lakes and marsh regions. Vaccination is needed as a complementary approach to the ongoing control programs. In the present study, we wanted to determine if the efficacies of DNA vaccines encoding the 23-kDa tetraspanin membrane protein (SjC23), triose phosphate isomerase (SjCTPI), and sixfold-repeated genes of the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) in the H chain of NP30 could be enhanced by boosting via electroporation in vivo and/or with cocktail protein vaccines. Mice vaccinated with cocktail DNA vaccines showed a significant worm reduction of 32.88% (P &lt; 0.01) and egg reduction of 36.20% (P &lt; 0.01). Vaccine efficacy was enhanced when animals were boosted with cocktail protein vaccines; adult worm and liver egg burdens were reduced 45.35% and 48.54%, respectively. Nearly identical results were obtained in mice boosted by electroporation in vivo, with adult worm and egg burdens reduced by 45.00% and 50.88%, respectively. The addition of a protein vaccine boost to this regimen further elevated efficacy to approximately 60% for adult worm burden and greater than 60% for liver egg reduction. The levels of interleukin-2, <e>gamma interferon</e>, and the ratios of immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a)/IgG1 clearly showed that cocktail DNA vaccines induced CD4(+) Th1-type responses. Boosting via either electroporation or with recombinant proteins significantly increased associated immune responses over those seen in mice vaccinated solely with DNA vaccines. Thus, schistosome DNA vaccine efficacy was significantly enhanced via boosting by electroporation in vivo and/or cocktail protein vaccines.",M2
19805616,"Functionally distinct subsets of human NK cells and monocyte/DC-like cells identified by coexpression of CD56, CD7, and CD4.The lack of natural killer (NK) cell-specific markers, as well as the overlap among several common surface antigens and functional properties, has obscured the delineation between NK cells and dendritic cells. Here, novel subsets of peripheral blood CD3/14/19(neg) NK cells and monocyte/dendritic cell (DC)-like cells were identified on the basis of CD7 and CD4 expression. Coexpression of CD7 and CD56 differentiates NK cells from CD56+ monocyte/DC-like cells, which lack CD7. In contrast to CD7+CD56+ NK cells, CD7(neg)CD56+ cells lack expression of NK cell-associated markers, but share commonalities in their expression of various monocyte/DC-associated markers. Using CD7, we observed approximately 60% of CD4+CD56+ cells were CD7(neg) cells, indicating the actual frequency of activated CD4+ NK cells is much lower in the blood than previously recognized. Functionally, only CD7+ NK cells secrete <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFNgamma) and degranulate after interleukin-12 (IL-12) plus IL-18 or K562 target cell stimulation. Furthermore, using CD7 to separate CD56+ NK cells and CD56+ myeloid cells, we demonstrate that unlike resting CD7+CD56+ NK cells, the CD7(neg)CD56+ myeloid cells stimulate a potent allogeneic response. Our data indicate that CD7 and CD56 coexpression discriminates NK cells from CD7(neg)CD56+ monocyte/DC-like cells, thereby improving our ability to study the intricacies of NK-cell subset phenotypes and functions in vivo.",M2
19805532,"Persistent infection contributes to heterologous protective immunity against fatal ehrlichiosis.Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME), an emerging and often life-threatening tick-transmitted disease, is caused by the obligately intracellular bacterium Ehrlichia chaffeensis. HME is modeled in C57BL/6 mice using Ehrlichia muris, which causes persistent infection, and Ixodes ovatus Ehrlichia (IOE), which is either acutely lethal or sublethal depending on the dose and route of inoculation. A persistent primary E. muris infection, but not a sublethal IOE infection, protects mice against an ordinarily lethal secondary IOE challenge. In the present study, we determined the role of persistent infection in maintenance of protective memory immune responses. E. muris-infected mice were treated with doxycycline or left untreated and then challenged with an ordinarily lethal dose of IOE. Compared to E. muris-primed mice treated with doxycycline, untreated mice persistently infected with E. muris had significantly greater numbers of antigen-specific <e>gamma interferon</e>-producing splenic memory T cells, significant expansion of CD4(+) CD25(+) T regulatory cells, and production of transforming growth factor beta1 in the spleen. Importantly, E. muris-primed mice treated with doxycycline showed significantly greater susceptibility to challenge infection with IOE compared to untreated mice persistently infected with E. muris. The study indicated that persistent ehrlichial infection contributes to heterologous protection by stimulating the maintenance of memory T-cell responses.",M2
19800441,"Transcutaneous immunization with novel lipid-based adjuvants induces protection against gastric Helicobacter pylori infection.The development of vaccines to combat pathogens that infect across mucosal surfaces has been a major goal of vaccine research. Successful mucosal vaccination requires the co-administration of adjuvants that can overcome the state of immune tolerance normally associated with mucosal application of proteins. In the case of oral immunization, delivery systems are also required to protect vaccine antigens against destruction by gastric pH and digestive enzymes. Furthermore, adjuvants used for mucosal delivery must be free of neurotoxic effects like those induced by the commonly used experimental mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin. Maintenance of the  cold chain  is also essential for the effectiveness of any vaccine and adjuvants/delivery systems that enhance the stability of a vaccine would offer a significant advantage. Needle-free methods of vaccination that induce protective immunity at multiple mucosal surfaces are also desirable for rapid vaccination of large populations. In the present study we show that transcutaneous immunization (TCI) using Lipid C, a novel lipid-based matrix originally developed for oral immunization, containing soluble Helicobacter sonicate significantly reduces the gastric bacterial burden in mice following gastric challenge with live Helicobacter pylori. Protection is associated with the production of splenic <e>gamma interferon</e> and gastric IgA and was achieved without the co-administration of potent and potentially toxic adjuvants, although protection was further enhanced by inclusion of CpG-ODN and cholera toxin in the lipid delivery system.",M2
19786561,"Vaccination with the ML0276 antigen reduces local inflammation but not bacterial burden during experimental Mycobacterium leprae infection.Leprosy elimination has been a goal of the WHO for the past 15 years. Widespread BCG vaccination and multidrug therapy have dramatically reduced worldwide leprosy prevalence, but new case detection rates have remained relatively constant. These data suggest that additional control strategies, such as a subunit vaccine, are required to block transmission and to improve leprosy control. We recently identified several Mycobacterium leprae antigens that stimulate <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) secretion upon incubation with blood from paucibacillary leprosy patients, a group who limit M. leprae growth and dissemination. In this study, we demonstrate that M. leprae-specific mouse T-cell lines recognize several of these antigens, with the ML0276 protein stimulating the most IFN-gamma secretion. We then examined if the ML0276 protein could be used in a subunit vaccine to provide protection against experimental M. leprae infection. Our data demonstrate that combining ML0276 with either a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (EM005), TLR7 (imiquimod), or TLR9 (CpG DNA) agonist during immunization induces Th1 responses that limit local inflammation upon experimental M. leprae infection. Our data indicate that only the ML0276/EM005 regimen is able to elicit a response that is transferable to recipient mice. Despite the potent Th1 response induced by this regimen, it could not provide protection in terms of limiting bacterial growth. We conclude that EM005 is the most potent adjuvant for stimulating a Th1 response and indicate that while a subunit vaccine containing the ML0276 protein may be useful for the prevention of immune pathology during leprosy, it will not control bacterial burden and is therefore unlikely to interrupt disease transmission.",M2
19781659,"Survival of secondary lethal systemic Francisella LVS challenge depends largely on interferon gamma.Although survival of primary infection with the live vaccine strain (LVS) of Francisella tularensis depends on interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), the relative importance of IFN-gamma to secondary protective immunity in vivo has not been clearly established. Here we examine the role of IFN-gamma in T cell priming and expression of vaccine-induced protection against lethal intraperitoneal challenge of mice. Large amounts of IFN-gamma were detected between days 3 and 7 in the sera of LVS-immunized mice, while relatively small amounts were found transiently after secondary LVS challenge. Consistent with the production of this cytokine, mice lacking IFN-gamma (<e>gamma interferon</e> knockout, GKO, mice) could not be successfully vaccinated with LVS or an attenuated mglA mutant of F. novicida to withstand secondary Francisella LVS challenge. Further, splenocytes from such primed mice did not adoptively transfer protection to naive GKO recipient mice in vivo, nor control the intramacrophage growth of LVS in vitro. Finally, LVS-immune WT mice depleted of IFN-gamma prior to intraperitoneal challenge survived only the lowest doses of challenge. Thus successful priming of protective LVS-immune T cells, as well as complete expression of protection against Francisella during secondary challenge, depends heavily on IFN-gamma.",M2
19779068,"The role of <e>gamma interferon</e> in innate immunity in the zebrafish embryo.The zebrafish genome contains ten genes that encode class II cytokine-like peptides, of which the two that are related most closely to mammalian interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) were named IFN-gamma1 and IFN-gamma2. Although the zebrafish has become a popular model system to study immune mechanisms, and although interferons are central regulators of immunity, which zebrafish cytokines correspond functionally to mammalian IFN-gamma has not been established. We used zebrafish embryos to assay the functions of IFN-gamma1 and IFN-gamma2, and have identified a subset of zebrafish homologs of the mammalian IFN-responsive genes as IFN-gamma targets in the zebrafish embryo: these genes are upregulated in response to raised levels of either IFN-gamma1 or IFN-gamma2. Infection studies using two different pathogens show that IFN-gamma signalling is required for resistance against bacterial infections in the young embryo and that the levels of IFN-gamma need to be regulated tightly: raising IFN-gamma levels sensitizes fish embryos against bacterial infection. Embryos injected with high doses of Escherichia coli are able to clear the bacteria within a day, and the gamma-interferons are necessary for this defence reaction. The protective response to Yersinia ruckeri, a natural fish pathogen that is lethal at low doses, also requires IFN-gamma. As in the induction of target genes, the two interferons act at least partly redundantly. Together with the previously demonstrated type III interferon response, these results show that the counterparts of the mammalian viral and bacterial interferon-dependent defence functions are in place in zebrafish embryos, and suggest that zebrafish IFN-gamma1 and IFN-gamma2 are functionally equivalent to mammalian IFN-gamma.",M2
19752037,"Frequencies of region of difference 1 antigen-specific but not purified protein derivative-specific <e>gamma interferon</e>-secreting T cells correlate with the presence of tuberculosis disease but do not distinguish recent from remote latent infections.The majority of individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis achieve lifelong immune containment of the bacillus. What constitutes this effective host immune response is poorly understood. We compared the frequencies of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-secreting T cells specific for five region of difference 1 (RD1)-encoded antigens and one DosR-encoded antigen in 205 individuals either with active disease (n = 167), whose immune responses had failed to contain the bacillus, or with remotely acquired latent infection (n = 38), who had successfully achieved immune control, and a further 149 individuals with recently acquired asymptomatic infection. When subjects with an IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay response to one or more RD1-encoded antigens were analyzed, T cells from subjects with active disease recognized more pools of peptides from these antigens than T cells from subjects with nonrecent latent infection (P = 0.002). The T-cell frequencies for peptide pools were greater for subjects with active infection than for subjects with nonrecent latent infection for summed RD1 peptide pools (P &lt;or= 0.006) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10) antigen (P = 0.029). Individuals with recently acquired (&lt;6 months) versus remotely acquired (&gt;6 months) latent infection did not differ in numbers of peptide pools recognized, proportions recognizing any individual antigen or peptide pool, or antigen-specific T-cell frequencies (P &gt;or= 0.11). The hierarchy of immunodominance for different antigens was purified protein derivative (PPD) &gt; CFP-10 &gt; early secretory antigenic target 6 &gt; Rv3879c &gt; Rv3878 &gt; Rv3873 &gt; Acr1, and the hierarchies were very similar for active and remotely acquired latent infections. Responses to the DosR antigen alpha-crystallin were not associated with latency (P = 0.373). In contrast to the RD1-specific responses, the responses to PPD were not associated with clinical status (P &gt; 0.17) but were strongly associated with positive tuberculin skin test results (&gt;or=15-mm induration; P &lt;or= 0.01). Our results suggest that RD1-specific IFN-gamma-secreting T-cell frequencies correlate with the presence of disease rather than with protective immunity in M. tuberculosis-infected individuals and do not distinguish recently acquired asymptomatic infection from remotely acquired latent infection.",M2
19752029,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins plus CpG Oligodeoxynucleotides confer protection to Mycobacterium bovis BCG-primed mice by inhibiting interleukin-4 secretion.Culture filtrate proteins (CFP) are potential targets for tuberculosis vaccine development. We previously showed that despite the high level of <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) production elicited by homologous immunization with CFP plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CFP/CpG), we did not observe protection when these mice were challenged with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In order to use the IFN-gamma-inducing ability of CFP antigens, in this study we evaluated a prime-boost heterologous immunization based on CFP/CpG to boost Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination in order to find an immunization schedule that could induce protection. Heterologous BCG-CFP/CpG immunization provided significant protection against experimental tuberculosis, and this protection was sustained during the late phase of infection and was even better than that conferred by a single BCG immunization. The protection was associated with high levels of antigen-specific IFN-gamma and interleukin-17 (IL-17) and low IL-4 production. The deleterious role of IL-4 was confirmed when IL-4 knockout mice vaccinated with CFP/CpG showed consistent protection similar to that elicited by BCG-CFP/CpG heterologous immunization. These findings show that a single dose of CFP/CpG can represent a new strategy to boost the protection conferred by BCG vaccination. Moreover, different immunological parameters, such as IFN-gamma and IL-17 and tightly regulated IL-4 secretion, seem to contribute to the efficacy of this tuberculosis vaccine.",M2
19740992,"Semliki forest virus expressing interleukin-12 induces antiviral and antitumoral responses in woodchucks with chronic viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.A vector based on Semliki Forest virus (SFV) expressing high levels of interleukin-12 (SFV-enhIL-12) has previously demonstrated potent antitumoral efficacy in small rodents with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) induced by transplantation of tumor cells. In the present study, the infectivity and antitumoral/antiviral effects of SFV vectors were evaluated in the clinically more relevant woodchuck model, in which primary HCC is induced by chronic infection with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). Intratumoral injection of SFV vectors expressing luciferase or IL-12 resulted in high reporter gene activity within tumors and cytokine secretion into serum, respectively, demonstrating that SFV vectors infect woodchuck tumor cells. For evaluating antitumoral efficacy, woodchuck tumors were injected with increasing doses of SFV-enhIL-12, and tumor size was measured by ultrasonography following treatment. In five (83%) of six woodchucks, a dose-dependent, partial tumor remission was observed, with reductions in tumor volume of up to 80%, but tumor growth was restored thereafter. Intratumoral treatment further produced transient changes in WHV viremia and antigenemia, with &gt;or=1.5-log(10) reductions in serum WHV DNA in half of the woodchucks. Antitumoral and antiviral effects were associated with T-cell responses to tumor and WHV antigens and with expression of CD4 and CD8 markers, <e>gamma interferon</e>, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that immune responses against WHV and HCC had been induced. These experimental observations suggest that intratumoral administration of SFV-enhIL-12 may represent a strategy for treatment of chronic HBV infection and associated HCC in humans but indicate that this approach could benefit from further improvements.",M2
19740988,"Expansion, reexpansion, and recall-like expansion of Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells in smallpox vaccination and monkeypox virus infection.Little is known about the in vivo kinetics of T-cell responses in smallpox/monkeypox. We showed that macaque Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells underwent 3-week-long expansion after smallpox vaccine immunization and displayed simple reexpansion in association with sterile anti-monkeypox virus (anti-MPV) immunity after MPV challenge. Virus-activated Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells exhibited <e>gamma interferon</e>-producing effector function after phosphoantigen stimulation. Surprisingly, like alphabeta T cells, suboptimally primed Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells in vaccinia virus/cidofovir-covaccinated macaques mounted major recall-like expansion after MPV challenge. Finally, Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells localized in inflamed lung tissues for potential regulation. Our studies provide the first in vivo evidence that viruses, despite their inability to produce exogenous phosphoantigen, can induce expansion, reexpansion, and recall-like expansion of Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells and stimulate their antimicrobial cytokine response.",M2
19737909,"Cross-reactive immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis DosR regulon-encoded antigens in individuals infected with environmental, nontuberculous mycobacteria.Mycobacterium tuberculosis DosR regulon-encoded antigens are highly immunogenic in M. tuberculosis-infected humans and are associated with latent tuberculosis infection. We have investigated the hypothesis that infection with or exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can induce cross-reactive immunity to M. tuberculosis DosR regulon-encoded antigens since responsiveness has been observed in non-M. tuberculosis-exposed but purified protein derivative-responsive individuals. M. tuberculosis DosR regulon-encoded antigen-specific T-cell responses were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of NTM-infected/exposed individuals. BLASTP was used to determine the presence of M. tuberculosis DosR regulon-encoded protein orthologs among environmental mycobacteria and nonmycobacteria. Significant <e>gamma interferon</e> production was observed in PBMCs from NTM-infected/exposed individuals in response to M. tuberculosis DosR regulon-encoded antigens. DosR regulon-encoded protein orthologs were prominently present in tuberculous and environmental mycobacteria and surprisingly also in nonmycobacteria. The ubiquitous presence of the highly conserved DosR master regulator protein Rv3133c suggests that this is a general adaptive bacterial response regulator. We report a first series of M. tuberculosis antigens to which cross-reactive immunity is induced by NTM infection/exposure. The high conservation of M. tuberculosis DosR regulon-encoded antigens most likely enables them to induce cross-reactive T-cell responses.",M2
19737903,"Codependent and independent effects of nitric oxide-mediated suppression of PhoPQ and Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 on intracellular Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium survival.Here we show that the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium PhoQ sensor kinase lessens the cytotoxicity of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the innate response of mononuclear phagocytic cells. This observation is consistent with the expression patterns of PhoP-activated genes during moderate nitrosative stress in the innate host response. In contrast, RNS synthesized during high-NO fluxes of <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma)-activated macrophages repress PhoP-activated lpxO, pagP, and phoP gene transcription. Because PhoP-regulated Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) genes are also repressed by high-order RNS (39), we investigated whether the NO-mediated inhibition of PhoPQ underlies the repression of SPI2. Our studies indicate that a third of the expression of the SPI2 spiC gene recorded in nonactivated macrophages depends on PhoQ. Transcription of spiC is repressed in IFN-gamma-primed macrophages in an iNOS-dependent manner, irrespective of the phoQ status of the bacteria. Transcription of spiC is restored in IFN-gamma-treated, iNOS-deficient macrophages to levels sustained by a phoQ mutant in nonactivated phagocytes, suggesting that most NO-dependent repression of spiC is due to the inhibition of PhoPQ-independent targets. Comparison of the intracellular fitness of spiC, phoQ, and spiC phoQ mutants revealed that PhoPQ and SPI2 have codependent and independent effects on S. Typhimurium survival during innate nitrosative stress. However, the intracellular survival of most S. Typhimurium bacteria is conferred by the PhoPQ two-component regulator, and the SPI2 type III secretion system is repressed by high-order RNS of IFN-gamma-activated macrophages.",M2
19729876,"Recombinant murine interleukin 4 protein therapy for psoriasis in a transgenic VEGF mouse model.BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a typical autoimmune disease caused by a deregulation of the Th1/Th2 balance, and immunotherapy for psoriasis has been shown to be clinically efficacious. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent mediator of angiogenesis. Evidence suggests that the chronic delivery of VEGF to the skin can result in a profound inflammatory condition with many of the cellular and molecular hallmarks of human psoriasis. In this study, we investigated whether the transgenic VEGF mouse is a suitable model for antipsoriatic studies. AIM: To determine the effect of a recombinant murine interleukin 4 (rmIL-4) in the transgenic VEGF mouse model. METHODS: Fifteen homozygous K14-VEGF transgenic mice were injected subcutaneously with rmIL-4 protein for 30 consecutive days with a prospective dose escalation of 0.5, 2 or 5 microg/kg. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed with ear samples. RESULTS: The rmIL-4 protein therapy was well tolerated. Tissue sections from treated skin showed improvements upon morphological and histological examinations: diminution of erythematous appearance and regression of epidermal thickness were observed, and T lymphocyte infiltration decreased significantly. The expressions of adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intracellular adhesion molecule 1, were found reduced. The level of IL-4 mRNA also increased while the level of <e>gamma-interferon</e> mRNA decreased, resulting in a 10-fold increase in the ratio of Th1/Th2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal that rmIL-4 has clinical efficacy for the treatment of K14-VEGF transgenic mice. Angiogenesis and inflammation were ameliorated by therapy with rmIL-4.",M2
19715782,"BCG vaccination reduces risk of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis as detected by <e>gamma interferon</e> release assay.AIMS: To investigate whether BCG vaccination, in addition to a reduction of active tuberculosis, leads to a reduction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection during an outbreak of tuberculosis. METHODS: Pupils (n=199) of a Junior School exposed to a pupil with active pulmonary tuberculosis were screened using a gamma interferon release assay for detection of M. tuberculosis infection (ex vivo ELISPOT assay). Relative risk of M. tuberculosis infection and pulmonary tuberculosis associated with BCG vaccination were calculated and adjusted for exposure risk. RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of children with previous BCG vaccination had a reactive gamma interferon release assay compared with 47% of unvaccinated children (unadjusted RR 0.61, 95%CI 0.39, 0.96). The protective effect of BCG vaccination persisted following adjustment for other risk factors for infection like ethnicity and proximity to the source case reflected in membership of class and activity groups (corrected relative risk 0.26, 95%CI 0.09, 0.69 and risk reduction of 74%, 95%CI 31%, 91%). A higher proportion of unvaccinated children (11%) were diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared with 5% of vaccinated children (RR 0.51 95%CI 0.15, 1.70). CONCLUSION: BCG vaccination was associated with a reduction of M. tuberculosis infection diagnosed by gamma interferon release assay testing in school children during a point source outbreak.",M2
19710295,"Yersinia pestis can bypass protective antibodies to LcrV and activation with <e>gamma interferon</e> to survive and induce apoptosis in murine macrophages.Yersinia pestis, the agent of plague, uses a type III secretion injectisome to deliver Yop proteins into macrophages to counteract phagocytosis and induce apoptosis. Additionally, internalized Y. pestis can survive in the phagosomes of naïve or gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-activated macrophages by blocking vacuole acidification. The Y. pestis LcrV protein is a target of protective antibodies. The binding of antibodies to LcrV at the injectisome tip results in neutralization of the apoptosis of Y. pestis-infected macrophages and is used as an in vitro correlate of protective immunity. The cytokines IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha can cooperate with anti-LcrV to promote protection against lethal Y. pestis infection in mice. It is not known if these phagocyte-activating cytokines cooperate with anti-LcrV to increase the killing of the pathogen and decrease apoptosis in macrophages. We investigated how anti-LcrV and IFN-gamma impact bacterial survival and apoptosis in cultured murine macrophages infected with Y. pestis KIM5. Y. pestis KIM5 opsonized with polyclonal or monoclonal anti-LcrV was used to infect macrophages treated with or without IFN-gamma. The phagocytosis and survival of KIM5 and the apoptosis of macrophages were measured at different time points postinfection. The results show that anti-LcrV reduced apoptosis at an early time point (5 h) but not at a later time point (24 h). Polyclonal anti-LcrV was unable to inhibit apoptosis at either time point in IFN-gamma-activated macrophages. Additionally, anti-LcrV was ineffective at promoting the killing of KIM5 in naïve or activated macrophages. We conclude that Y. pestis can bypass protective antibodies to LcrV and activation with IFN-gamma to survive and induce apoptosis in murine macrophages.",M2
19710134,"Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 infection of <e>gamma interferon</e>-deficient mice on a BALB/c background results in acute lethal pneumonia that is dependent on specific viral genes.Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is critical for the control of chronic infection with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (gammaHV68). Current data indicate that IFN-gamma has a lesser role in the control of acute replication of gammaHV68. Here, we show that IFN-gamma-deficient mice on the BALB/c genetic background poorly control acute viral replication and succumb to early death by acute pneumonia. Notably, this acute, lethal pneumonia was dependent not only on the viral dose, but also on specific viral genes including the viral cyclin gene, previously identified to be important in promoting optimal chronic infection and reactivation from latency.",M2
19703975,"Francisella tularensis induces ubiquitin-dependent major histocompatibility complex class II degradation in activated macrophages.The intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis survives and replicates within macrophages, ultimately killing the host cell. Resolution of infection requires the development of adaptive immunity through presentation of F. tularensis antigens to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We have previously established that F. tularensis induces macrophage prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, leading to skewed T-cell responses. PGE2 can also downregulate macrophage major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression, suggesting that F. tularensis-elicited PGE2 may further alter T-cell responses via inhibition of class II expression. To test this hypothesis, <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma)-activated reporter macrophages were exposed to supernatants from F. tularensis-infected macrophages, and the class II levels were measured. Exposure of macrophages to infection supernatants results in essentially complete clearance of surface class II and CD86, compromising the macrophage's ability to present antigens to CD4 T cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that infection supernatants elicit ubiquitin-dependent class II downregulation and degradation within intracellular acidic compartments. By comparison, exposure to PGE2 alone only leads to a minor decrease in macrophage class II expression, demonstrating that a factor distinct from PGE2 is eliciting the majority of class II degradation. However, production of this non-PGE2 factor is dependent on macrophage cyclooxygenase activity and is induced by PGE2. These results establish that F. tularensis induces the production of a PGE2-dependent factor that elicits MHC class II downregulation in IFN-gamma-activated macrophages through ubiquitin-mediated delivery of class II to lysosomes, establishing another mechanism for the modulation of macrophage antigen presentation during F. tularensis infection.",M2
19692626,"Multiple T-cell responses to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 are enhanced by dendritic cells.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific T-cell reactivity has been related to protection from disease progression. Optimal T-cell reactivity to HIV-1 presumably requires antigen processing and presentation by professional antigen-presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells (DC). Here we examined whether multiple HIV-1-specific T-cell functions are enhanced by stimulation with HIV-1 peptide-loaded DC derived from HIV-1-infected subjects on antiretroviral therapy. We first found that mature DC increased the number of <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma)-producing T cells detected by enzyme-linked immunospot assay to overlapping 15-mer peptides of HIV-1 Gag and Nef, compared to stimulation with peptide-loaded, immature DC or to peptides without DC. IFN-gamma production was lower in response to large pools of the Gag and Nef peptides, regardless of presentation by DC. We further observed that HIV-1 peptide-loaded, mature DC stimulated greater CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell proliferation than did the peptides without DC and that T-cell proliferation was lower in response to larger pools of the peptides. The lower T-cell IFN-gamma and proliferation responses to the larger peptide pools were related to lower T-cell viability. Finally, the number of polyfunctional CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells stimulated by HIV-1 peptide-loaded, mature DC, defined as positive by intracellular staining for more than one immune mediator (IFN-gamma, interleukin 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, macrophage inhibitory protein 1beta, or CD107a), was greater than that stimulated by the peptides alone. These results indicate that DC can enhance multiple types of HIV-1-specific T-cell functions.",M2
19692459,"Impaired plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC)-NK cell activity in viremic human immunodeficiency virus infection attributable to impairments in both PDC and NK cell function.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections impair plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC) and natural killer (NK) cell subset numbers and functions, though little is known about PDC-NK cell interactions during these infections. We evaluated PDC-dependent NK cell killing and <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) and granzyme B production, using peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based and purified cell assays of samples from HCV- and HIV-infected subjects. CpG-enhanced PBMC killing and IFN-gamma and granzyme B activity (dependent on PDC and NK cells) were impaired in viremic HIV infection. In purified PDC-NK cell culture experiments, CpG-enhanced, PDC-dependent NK cell activity was cell contact and IFN-alpha dependent, and this activity was impaired in viremic HIV infection but not in HCV infection. In heterologous PDC-NK cell assays, impaired PDC-NK cell killing activity was largely attributable to an NK cell defect, while impaired PDC-NK cell IFN-gamma-producing activity was attributable to both PDC and NK cell defects. Additionally, the response of NK cells to direct IFN-alpha stimulation was defective in viremic HIV infection, and this defect was not attributable to diminished IFN-alpha receptor expression, though IFN-alpha receptor and NKP30 expression was closely associated with killer activity in viremic HIV infection but not in healthy controls. These data indicate that during uncontrolled HIV infection, PDC-dependent NK cell function is impaired, which is in large part attributable to defective IFN-alpha-induced NK cell activity and not to altered IFN-alpha receptor, NKP30, NKP44, NKP46, or NKG2D expression.",M2
19687195,"Roles for NK cells and an NK cell-independent source of intestinal <e>gamma interferon</e> for innate immunity to Cryptosporidium parvum infection.A gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-dependent innate immune response operates against the intestinal parasite Cryptosporidium parvum in T- and B-cell-deficient SCID mice. Although NK cells are a major source of IFN-gamma in innate immunity, their protective role against C. parvum has been unclear. The role of NK cells in innate immunity was investigated using Rag2-/- mice, which lack T and B cells, and Rag2-/- gammac-/- mice, which, in addition, lack NK cells. Adult mice of both knockout lines developed progressive chronic infections; however, on most days the level of oocyst excretion was higher in Rag2-/- gammac-/- mice and these animals developed morbidity and died, whereas within the same period the Rag2-/- mice appeared healthy. Neonatal mice of both mouse lines survived a rapid onset of infection that reached a higher intensity in Rag2-/- gammac-/- mice. Significantly, similar levels of intestinal IFN-gamma mRNA were expressed in Rag2-/- and Rag2-/- gammac-/- mice. Also, infections in each mouse line were exacerbated by treatment with anti-IFN-gamma neutralizing antibodies. These results support a protective role for NK cells and IFN-gamma in innate immunity against C. parvum. In addition, the study implies that an intestinal cell type other than NK cells may be an important source of IFN-gamma during infection and that NK cells may have an IFN-gamma-independent protective role.",M2
19681171,"Regulation of activin A synthesis in microglial cells: pathophysiological implications for bacterial meningitis.Previous studies have shown that activin A, a neuroprotective cytokine and dimeric polypeptide composed of two betaA subunits, is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients suffering from bacterial meningitis. In this study, to elucidate further the functional significance and pathophysiological implications of these findings, we demonstrated that microglial cells are not only the source but also the target cells of activin A in the central nervous system: immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR revealed expression of activin subunit betaA mRNA as well as activin receptor type I and type II mRNA in rat microglia in vitro. Further studies showed that activin enhances microglial proliferation and decreases the <e>gamma-interferon</e>-induced synthesis of nitric oxide, one of several microglial mediators involved in the inflammatory response in microglia activation. Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA showed an inhibitory effect of activin on inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1beta gene and protein levels after lipopolysaccharide treatment. We suggest that the increased synthesis of activin A is directly involved, via influence on microglia cell functions, in the modulation of the inflammatory response in bacterial meningitis.",M2
19651871,"Perforin and <e>gamma interferon</e> expression are required for CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell-dependent protective immunity against a human parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, elicited by heterologous plasmid DNA prime-recombinant adenovirus 5 boost vaccination.A heterologous prime-boost strategy using plasmid DNA, followed by replication-defective recombinant adenovirus 5, is being proposed as a powerful way to elicit CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell-mediated protective immunity against intracellular pathogens. We confirmed this concept and furthered existing research by providing evidence that the heterologous prime-boost regimen using the gene encoding amastigote surface protein 2 elicited CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell-mediated protective immunity (reduction of acute parasitemia and prolonged survival) against experimental infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. Protective immunity correlated with the presence of in vivo antigen-specific cytotoxic activity prior to challenge. Based on this, our second goal was to determine the outcome of infection after heterologous prime-boost immunization of perforin-deficient mice. These mice were highly susceptible to infection. A detailed analysis of the cell-mediated immune responses in immunized perforin-deficient mice showed an impaired gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) secretion by immune spleen cells upon restimulation in vitro with soluble recombinant antigen. In spite of a normal numeric expansion, specific CD8(+) T cells presented several functional defects detected in vivo (cytotoxicity) and in vitro (simultaneous expression of CD107a/IFN-gamma or IFN-gamma/tumor necrosis factor alpha) paralleled by a decreased expression of CD44 and KLRG-1. Our final goal was to determine the importance of IFN-gamma in the presence of highly cytotoxic T cells. Vaccinated IFN-gamma-deficient mice developed highly cytotoxic cells but failed to develop any protective immunity. Our study thus demonstrated a role for perforin and IFN-gamma in a number of T-cell-mediated effector functions and in the antiparasitic immunity generated by a heterologous plasmid DNA prime-adenovirus boost vaccination strategy.",M2
19651125,"Natural killer cell IFN-gamma-activity is associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy.The ability of natural killer (NK) cells to produce <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) after ex vivo stimulation with crude schizont lysate of Plasmodium falciparum was studied in uninfected and P. falciparum-infected pregnant Gabonese women segregated according to the gravidity at the time of delivery. This activity was measured in purified NK cells as well as in whole blood from the periphery and cord. Crude schizont lysate-stimulated NK cells from primiparous women produced significantly more IFN-gamma than those from multiparous women (P&lt;0.001). Women with malaria infection produced more IFN-gamma than negative women in peripheral blood (P&lt;0.001) indicating that immunological determinants regulating the susceptibility to malaria in pregnant women are parasite-specific. These findings reveal that NK cells are major source of IFN-gamma when exposed to P. falciparum antigens in vitro in absence of any other co-stimulant.",M2
19647514,"Two-site phosphorylation of EPRS coordinates multimodal regulation of noncanonical translational control activity.Glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) is a component of the heterotetrameric <e>gamma-interferon</e>-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex that binds 3'UTR GAIT elements in multiple interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible mRNAs and suppresses their translation. Here, we elucidate the specific EPRS phosphorylation events that regulate GAIT-mediated gene silencing. IFN-gamma induces sequential phosphorylation of Ser(886) and Ser(999) in the noncatalytic linker connecting the synthetase cores. Phosphorylation of both sites is essential for EPRS release from the parent tRNA multisynthetase complex. Ser(886) phosphorylation is required for the interaction of NSAP1, which blocks EPRS binding to target mRNAs. The same phosphorylation event induces subsequent binding of ribosomal protein L13a and GAPDH and restores mRNA binding. Finally, Ser(999) phosphorylation directs the formation of a functional GAIT complex that binds initiation factor eIF4G and represses translation. Thus, two-site phosphorylation provides structural and functional pliability to EPRS and choreographs the repertoire of activities that regulates inflammatory gene expression.",M2
19641100,"Identification of novel Mycobacterium bovis antigens by dissection of crude protein fractions.Culture filtrate and cell extracts from Mycobacterium bovis cultures contain molecules which could promote protective immunity to tuberculosis in animals. Different protein fractions of M. bovis cultures were obtained by elution electrophoresis and were tested in experimentally infected cattle. The fractions that elicited <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma) responses were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and individual proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The open reading frames were cloned, expressed as their recombinant forms, and retested with naturally and experimentally infected animals. Eleven protein fractions were highly reactive, from which the Rv1636, HspX, Rv0138, Rv2524, EsxI, and Rv3740 recombinant proteins were obtained. EsxI and HspX were the antigens most recognized by the IFN-gamma release assay. In summary, a proteomic approach allowed the identification of novel antigens useful for the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis.",M2
19667047,"Cytotoxicity and secretion of <e>gamma interferon</e> are carried out by distinct CD8 T cells during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.The host immune response is generally sufficient to contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. It does not, however, efficiently prevent subsequent infection with M. tuberculosis or provide sterilizing immunity. While the understanding of the immune response generated against this pathogen is incomplete, improvements have been achieved due to advances in immunological tools. In this study, we analyzed the multifunctional nature of primary and memory CD8 T-cell responses generated during murine M. tuberculosis infection. We generated a recombinant M. tuberculosis strain expressing ovalbumin (OVA) epitopes in order to expand the peptides for the detection of CD8 T cells during M. tuberculosis infection and enable us to use OVA-specific reagents. Our results indicate that the majority of M. tuberculosis-specific CD8 T cells are limited to either cytotoxicity or the secretion of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), with cytotoxicity being far more prevalent than IFN-gamma secretion. Memory CD8 T cells responded earlier and reached higher levels in the lungs than naïve CD8 T cells, as was expected. They were, however, less cytotoxic and secreted less IFN-gamma than newly primed CD8 T cells, suggesting that one factor contributing to bacterial persistence and lack of sterilizing immunity may be the low quality of memory cells that are generated.",M2
19651872,"Plasmodium falciparum-specific cellular immune responses after immunization with the RTS,S/AS02D candidate malaria vaccine in infants living in an area of high endemicity in Mozambique.Results from clinical trials in areas where malaria is endemic have shown that immunization with RTS,S/AS02A malaria vaccine candidate induces partial protection in adults and children and cellular effector and memory responses in adults. For the first time in a malaria vaccine trial, we sought to assess the cell-mediated immune responses to RTS,S antigen components in infants under 1 year of age participating in a clinical phase I/IIb trial of RTS,S/AS02D in Mozambique. Circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific responses were detected in approximately half of RTS,S-immunized infants and included <e>gamma interferon</e> (IFN-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and combined IL-2/IL-4 responses. The median stimulation indices of cytokine-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells were very low but significantly higher in RTS,S-immunized infants than in infants that received the comparator vaccine. Protection against subsequent malarial infection tended to be associated with a higher percentage of individuals with CSP-specific IL-2 in the supernatant (P = 0.053) and with higher CSP-specific IFN-gamma-producing CD8(+) T-cell responses (P = 0.07). These results report for the first time the detection of malaria-specific cellular immune responses after vaccination of infants less than 1 year of age and pave the way for future field studies of cellular immunity to malaria vaccine candidates.",M2
