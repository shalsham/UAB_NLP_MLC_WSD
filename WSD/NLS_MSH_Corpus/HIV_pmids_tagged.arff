20609987,"Antiretroviral therapy and management of <e>HIV</e> infection.Antiretroviral therapy of HIV infection has changed a uniformly fatal into a potentially chronic disease. There are now 17 drugs in common use for HIV treatment. Patients who can access and adhere to combination therapy should be able to achieve durable, potentially lifelong suppression of HIV replication. Despite the unquestioned success of antiretroviral therapy, limitations persist. Treatment success needs strict lifelong drug adherence. Although the widely used drugs are generally well tolerated, most have some short-term toxic effects and all have the potential for both known and unknown long-term toxic effects. Drug and administration costs limit treatment in resource-poor regions, and are a growing concern even in resource rich settings. Finally, complete or near complete control of viral replication does not fully restore health. Long-term treated patients who are on an otherwise effective regimen often show persistent immune dysfunction and have higher than expected risk for various non-AIDS-related complications, including heart, bone, liver, kidney, and neurocognitive diseases.",M1

20595255,"Survival and cessation in injecting drug users: prospective observational study of outcomes and effect of opiate substitution treatment.OBJECTIVES: To examine survival and long term cessation of injecting in a cohort of drug users and to assess the influence of opiate substitution treatment on these outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective open cohort study. SETTING: A single primary care facility in Edinburgh. PARTICIPANTS: 794 patients with a history of injecting drug use presenting between 1980 and 2007; 655 (82%) were followed up by interview or linkage to primary care records and mortality register, or both, and contributed 10,390 person years at risk; 557 (85%) had received opiate substitution treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Duration of injecting: years from first injection to long term cessation, defined as last injection before period of five years of non-injecting; mortality before cessation; overall survival. RESULTS: In the entire cohort 277 participants achieved long term cessation of injecting, and 228 died. Half of the survivors had poor health related quality of life. Median duration from first injection to death was 24 years for participants with <e>HIV</e> and 41 years for those without HIV. For each additional year of opiate substitution treatment the hazard of death before long term cessation fell 13% (95% confidence interval 17% to 9%) after adjustment for HIV, sex, calendar period, age at first injection, and history of prison and overdose. Conversely exposure to opiate substitution treatment was inversely related to the chances of achieving long term cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Opiate substitution treatment in injecting drug users in primary care reduces this risk of mortality, with survival benefits increasing with cumulative exposure to treatment. Treatment does not reduce the overall duration of injecting.",M1
20592367,"Anal cytology as a screening tool for early detection of anal dysplasia in <e>HIV</e>-infected women.BACKGROUND AND AIM: HIV-infected patients show a high rate of anal dysplasia and anal carcinoma but there is no gold standard for early detection. Therefore, the objectives of this prospective study were: a) evaluation of an anal screening using anal/perianal cytology; b) in case of a positive result to investigate its relation to immune status, clinical symptoms of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In every HIV-infected woman visiting our gynaecological outpatient clinic, an anal and perianal swab for anal cytology was taken. One experienced cytologist examined all specimens. Relevant details of the HIV-related history such as CDC classification, CD4 count, viral load, actual antiretroviral therapy etc. were documented. RESULTS: Altogether, 104 HIV-infected women were enrolled on this study. The results of 13 (13.5%) anal cytologies were classified as suspicious for low-grade or high-grade anal dysplasia and 6 of these were confirmed in an anal biopsy. A total of 9 out of 13 also had a cervical dysplasia and 12 were positive for high-risk HPV at the cervix. Ten of these women had already experienced clinical symptoms of their HIV infection and 8 showed a nadir of the CD4 count below 200 cells/microl. All but one took a highly active antiretroviral therapy. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, anal screening using anal cytology showed 13.5% suspected anal dysplasia in HIV-infected women. All performed biopsies revealed the presence of a high-grade anal lesion. The majority of these women already had an advanced disease and/or immune defect related to their HIV infection. In summary, we found anal cytology to be a useful tool to early detect anal dysplasia of high-risk patients such as HIV-infected women. How far this screening method contributes to the prevention of anal cancer has to be evaluated in further investigations.",M1

20571425,"Community engagement and investment in biomedical <e>HIV</e> prevention research for youth: rationale, challenges, and approaches.There has been a growing awareness of the importance of engaging communities in the development, testing, and eventual dissemination of biomedical strategies. Community engagement offers many benefits but comes with many challenges. This article will discuss these benefits and challenges and describe two examples of community engagement, Connect to Protect in the United States, and the South African Studies on HIV in Adolescents Project in South Africa, that represent investment in community engagement as preparation for biomedical HIV prevention clinical trials for youth.",M1
20571423,"Epidemiology of <e>HIV</e> infection and risk in adolescents and youth.Adolescents and youth aged 15-24 are one of the populations most impacted by the global HIV epidemic with an estimated 50% of new infections occurring in this age group. They are thus one of the prime populations for targeting behavioral and biomedical preventions. However, the dynamics of the HIV epidemic in youth vary widely by geographic region and risk behavior profiles. There are also biological and neurodevelopmental considerations that must be considered in the development, testing, and ultimate dissemination of HIV prevention interventions. These concepts are broadly discussed here.",M1
20571422,"Involving vulnerable populations of youth in <e>HIV</e> prevention clinical research.Adolescents continue to be at high risk for HIV infection, with young men who have sex with men and youth with drug abuse and/or mental health problems at particularly high risk. Multiple factors may interact to confer risk for these youth. Engaging vulnerable youth in HIV prevention research can present unique challenges in the areas of enrollment, retention, and trial adherence. Examples of successful engagement with vulnerable youth offer encouraging evidence for the feasibility of including these youth in clinical trials. Ethical challenges must be taken into consideration before embarking on biomedical HIV prevention studies with vulnerable youth, especially in the global context. Given the many individual and contextual factors that contribute to their high-risk status, it is essential that vulnerable youth populations be included in HIV prevention clinical research studies.",M1
20571421,"Youth-specific considerations in the development of preexposure prophylaxis, microbicide, and vaccine research trials.Preventing <e>HIV</e> infection in adolescents and young adults will require a multimodal targeted approach, including individual-directed behavioral risk reduction, community-level structural change, and biomedical interventions to prevent sexual transmission. Trials testing biomedical interventions to prevent HIV transmission will require special attention in this population due to the unique psychosocial and physiologic characteristics that differentiate them from older populations. For example, microbicide research will need to consider acceptability, dosing requirements, and coinfection rates that are unique to this population. Preexposure prophylaxis studies also will need to consider potential unique psychosocial issues such as sexual disinhibition and acceptability as well as unique pharmacokinetic parameters of antiretroviral agents. Vaccine trials also face unique issues with this population, including attitudes toward vaccines, risks related to false-positive HIV tests related to vaccine, and different immune responses based on more robust immunity. In this article, we will discuss issues around implementing each of these biomedical prevention modalities in trials among adolescents and young adults to help to guide future successful research targeting this population.",M1
20571420,"Behavioral considerations for engaging youth in <e>HIV</e> clinical research.From both scientific and ethical perspectives, it is important that youth be enrolled in biomedical HIV prevention clinical trials. At the same time, adolescents, as minors, are considered a vulnerable population requiring particular attention to the reduction of potential harm associated with participation in such trials. In this article, we review the evidence supporting enrollment of youth in HIV clinical trials, including data on HIV infection rates, sexual behavior, and cognitive, psychosocial, and neurophysiological development. Next, we address the potential risks associated with clinical trial participation, with a focus on the concept of preventive misconception, the tendencies to (1) overestimate the probability of assignment to the experimental condition, as opposed to the placebo, and (2) assume that the experimental intervention is efficacious. Finally, we discuss targeted interventions to reduce preventive misconception and the importance of developing and testing adolescent-friendly risk-reduction interventions that are tailored to the structure and time frame of a biomedical HIV prevention clinical trial. The very issues that make inclusion of youth in HIV prevention clinical trials necessary also demand that particularly intensive efforts be made to protect participating minors from the harm that could accrue from a clinical trial.",M1
20571419,"Ethical and regulatory considerations for the inclusion of adolescents in <e>HIV</e> biomedical prevention research.Adolescents should be enrolled in ethically appropriate and scientifically rigorous HIV biomedical prevention research involving vaccines, pre-exposure prophylaxis, or microbicides. There is general agreement that children should only be enrolled in a clinical trial if the scientific objectives cannot be met either through enrolling adult subjects who can provide informed consent personally or through conducting research using animal models. In addition, the risks to which children are exposed in a clinical trial without the possibility of direct therapeutic benefit must be low. Children also should not be placed at a disadvantage after being enrolled in a clinical trial by, for example, being exposed to an unnecessarily risky intervention or by failing to receive a comparable treatment that would prevent significant morbidity or mortality. In light of this shared framework, we discuss the timing of enrolling adolescents in HIV prevention trials; some general study design considerations that may be necessary for adequate labeling of products for an adolescent indication; the use of data obtained from international studies for licensure applications in the United States; the role of parental permission and adolescent assent to research participation; and the inclusion of pregnant adolescents in HIV biomedical prevention research.",M1
20571418,"Barriers to adolescents' participation in <e>HIV</e> biomedical prevention research.OBJECTIVES: The inclusion of adolescents in HIV prevention clinical research has the potential to improve the current understanding of the safety and efficacy of biomedical prevention technologies in younger populations that are at increasing risk of HIV infection. However, there are significant individual, operational, and community-level barriers to engaging adolescents in clinical prevention trials. METHODS: This paper identifies and addresses individual, operational, and community-level barriers to adolescents' participation in HIV biomedical prevention research. RESULTS: Barriers identified and addressed in this paper include: (1) insufficient understanding of clinic prevention research, (2) self-presentation bias, (3) issues surrounding parental consent, (4) access to clinical trials, (5) mistrust of research, and (6) stigma associated with participation in clinical trials. Examples of programs where adolescents have been successfully engaged in prevention research are highlighted and the lessons learned from these programs indicate that establishing collaborations with key stakeholders in the community are essential for conducting biomedical research with vulnerable populations, including adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Given the importance of understanding adolescents' reactions, acceptability, and utilization of new biomedical prevention technologies it is imperative that researchers acknowledge and address these barriers to enhance adolescents' participation and retention in HIV biomedical prevention research.",M1
20571417,"Introduction: Paving the way for biomedical <e>HIV</e> prevention interventions in youth.The HIV epidemic among youth continues to grow at alarming proportions throughout the world. Efficacious and comprehensive biomedical prevention interventions are desperately needed for this vulnerable population if a reduction in global HIV incidence is to be achieved. To succeed at enrolling youth in studies of such modalities, communities whose youth will be participating must be highly engaged throughout the spectrum of research concept development to implementation and later translation into programs. In this process, there are numerous challenges, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the youth themselves. Intrinsic ones include developmental considerations in physiology, pharmacology, and behavior; extrinsic considerations are those in the community, ethical, legal, and regulatory arenas and those in designing clinical trials for youth to feasibly participate. We convened a consultative meeting to deliberate over these considerations among a variety of experts representing youth and their community, advocacy groups, academia, industry, regulators, and others in the federal government. Broad recommendations aimed at many stakeholders in the adolescent HIV prevention research agenda were made and were to improve the timely inclusion of youth in this research to ensure that prevention agents can be used safely by youth as soon as they become available to adults.",M1

Groups included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive infants with CD4(+) cell percentages &gt; or =25% who initiated immediate antiretroviral treatment (the HIV+/ART+ group) or whose antiretroviral treatment was deferred until clinically or immunologically indicated (the HIV+/ART- group). Immune responses were also evaluated in HIV-noninfected infants born to HIV-seronegative (M-/I-) or HIV-positive mothers (M+/I-). Antibody concentrations were similar between HIV+/ART+ and HIV+/ART- infants. However, antibody concentrations were lower in M-/I- infants than in M+/I- infants. Nevertheless, M-/I- infants had superior OPA responses, compared with those in HIV+/ART+ infants, who in turn had better OPA responses, compared with those in HIV+/ART- infants.",M1
20578674,"Safety issues in didactic anatomical dissection in regions of high <e>HIV</e> prevalence.Ruggiero et al. (2009) have recently reviewed the importance of dissection in the training of physicians, the role played by students' fears of infection, and the evidence that those sometimes extreme fears are unwarranted even respecting HIV and AIDS, whose dangers continue to be featured prominently in popular media as though everyone were at constant risk. It is not especially surprising that the risk of accidental infection by HIV is negligibly low in random dissections in Italy where, as in Europe generally, the prevalence of HIV is only a fraction of a percent. The question arises, however, what the risk might be in regions where the prevalence of HIV is considerably higher. South Africa is an obvious candidate for investigating this issue since the prevalence of HIV there is among the highest reported by UNAIDS and other official bodies. Furthermore, its recordkeeping system is more reliable than that of most other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the global region that is universally regarded as the epicenter of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In addition, South Africa has a globally recognized reputation in the teaching of human anatomy. Perhaps surprisingly, the risks in South Africa also seem to be much less than might be anticipated on the basis of the conventional wisdom. One reason for this counter-intuitive conclusion is that estimates of HIV prevalence and of AIDS deaths issued by international bodies are significantly overblown, with some estimates being 20 times or more greater than locally recorded numbers. A second basis for the unexpected conclusion is that the possibility of false-positive HIV tests has been ignored despite the considerable range of evidence that false-positives can be a significant part, perhaps even a major part, of positive tests in certain groups or certain regions, saliently among people of African ancestry.",M1
20578559,"Knowledge and views regarding condom use among female garment factory workers in Cambodia.Cambodia is experiencing a generalized <e>HIV</e> epidemic; there is evidence some populations within Cambodia are particularly vulnerable to infection. A mixed methods study was conducted in 2006 on the vulnerability to contract HIV of rural-to-urban migrant Cambodian garment factory workers. This paper reports the views of these female migrant workers regarding the use of condoms in their sexual relationships. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 20 workers about their knowledge and experiences regarding condom use. Both married and single women were knowledgeable about HIV transmission, but there was a spectrum of perspectives about condom use with their current or future partners. Some women insisted partners use condoms, while others did not expect partner compliance, and a third group avoided discussing condom use with their partners. HIV prevention programs should include male partners. For many of these migrant women, interventions focussing on education about HIV transmission and condom negotiation skills are insufficient since implementation requires male cooperation.",M1

The spouse was still negative for HIV with a history of having regular unprotected sex with the index case which highlights the inefficient transmissibility of HIV-2. Continued surveillance is needed in screening of HIV-2 infection, especially in cases with a high index of suspicion and risk factors for HIV-2, as these patients develop AIDS related symptoms quite late due to delayed progression.",M1
20578502,"Psychosocial burden of abnormal pap smears among <e>HIV</e>-infected women at Chon Buri hospital, Thailand.This retrospective case-control study assessed the psychological burden of abnormal Pap smears, and their prevalence and characteristics among HIV-infected women attending an HIV clinic. Women with positive (n = 73) and negative Pap-smear results (n = 317) were assessed for psychosocial burden using 4 questionnaires: Psycho-Social Impact of Abnormal Pap Smears (PEAPS-Q), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Work Productivity and Impairment (WPAI) and the EURO-Qol Thermometer. The prevalence of pre-cervical cancer lesions in HIV infected woman was 17.5% (ASCUS 2.9%, LSIL 3.8%, HSIL 7.4%, SCC 1.7%, and atypical glandular cells including adenocarcinoma 1.7%). HIV infected women with abnormal Pap smears showed higher anxiety levels on the HADS questionnaire (p = 0.015); this had a significant effect on regular daily activities (p = 0.009) per the WPAI questionnaire compared to HIV positive women with normal Pap smear. Ever married HIV infected woman with an abnormal Pap smear had a significantly lower psychosocial burden using the PEAPS-Q questionnaire (p &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for age and duration since last Pap smear, the education level of the patient was a strong predictor for anxiety. Patients, with a college education had significantly lower anxiety (p = 0.001, 95% CI -5.74 to -1.37) than those with lower or higher education. Women with HSIL were more anxious (p = 0.014, 95% CI 0.49 -4.39) than those with low grade or normal lesions.",M1
20578494,"Access to <e>HIV</e> testing for sex workers in Bangkok, Thailand: a high prevalence of HIV among street-based sex workers.We offered voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV and syphilis to women attending three public sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics in Bangkok, Thailand from May 2004 to June 2006. The testing was performed at either one of three STI clinics in Bangkok or at mobile VCT in the same area as the outreach activity. Six-hundred eighty-four women were tested. The HIV prevalences among the street-based sex workers, brothel-based sex workers and other women in these areas not reporting sex work who tested in the clinics were 45.8% (38/83), 4.2% (10/236) and 9.9% (28/284), respectively. The prevalences of syphilis in these groups were 13.3%, 2.1%, and 2.6%, respectively. Street-based sex work and longer duration of sex work were independent risk factors for HIV in-fection (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively). HIV and syphilis prevalences were 21.0% and 3.7% among 81 street-based sex workers accepting mobile VCT, The street-based sex workers in Bangkok had substantially higher HIV and syphilis prevalences than other sex workers. Street-based sex workers should be sampled during routine surveillance to obtain systematic information on disease preva-lence and risk behaviors in this group.",M1
20578493,"ZAP-70 positive cells in treated and untreated <e>HIV</e>-1 infected patients.ZAP-70 is a critical protein tyrosine kinase in T-cell activation and proliferation processes. Defective recruitment of ZAP-70 molecules results in termination of the T-cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction pathway. Impairment of this pathway is one of the early markers of disease progression in HIV-1 infected individuals. T-cell dysfunction in HIV infected patients may be connected to a defect in the proximal TCR signaling cascade. To evaluate this presumption, the numbers and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of ZAP-70 positive cells in patients with treated and untreated HIV-1 infection and healthy controls were analyzed by flow cytometry. A correlation between the MFI in ZAP 70 molecules and the viral load was evaluated. A total of 41 HIV-1 infected patients, 30 patients on HAART and 11 untreated patients, and 11 healthy controls were enrolled. The data show ZAP-70+/CD4+ cells in treated and untreated HIV-1 infected individuals had a greater MFI of ZAP-70 molecules than those from healthy controls (p &lt; 0.001). The inverse correlation between the percentage of CD4+cells and the MFI of ZAP-70+/CD4+ T-cells was significant (r = -0.5; p &lt; 0.01). A stronger correlation between the percentage of CD4+/CD25+ cells and the MFI of ZAP-70+/CD4+ cells was observed (r =-0.6; p &lt; 0.01). However, no significant correlation was seen between the MFI of the ZAP-70+/CD4+cells and the viral load in patients with untreated HIV-1 infection (r = -0.4, p = 0.16). For HIV-1 treated patients, the viral loads were too low to detect so it was not possible to calculate the correlation. Elevated MFI levels of ZAP-70 molecules in CD4+ cells in HIV infected patients may be associated with an inability to further activate T-cells.",M1
20578492,"Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in adult human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients in Thailand.Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an important adverse event among human immunodeficiency virus (<e>HIV</e>)-infected patients taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The epidemiology of IRIS in Thailand has not been well examined, especially among adult HIV-infected patients. In the present study, we reviewed the medical records of 174 HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naive patients older than 15 years (the median CD4 count at commencement of HAART was 37 cells/mm3) and compared characteristics of patients with and without IRIS. During a 12-month follow-up period after commencement of HAART, 11 cases (6.3%) of IRIS were identified (4.2/100 patient-years HAART). The cases included nine cases with mycobacterial infection, one with cytomegalovirus retinitis and one with cryptococcal meningitis. The patients with IRIS were significantly younger than those without IRIS (29 vs 36 on medians, p = 0.022). The median interval between commencement of HAART and the onset of IRIS was 22 days. Although all patients with IRIS improved with or without corticosteroids, they were more frequently hospitalized during a 12-month follow-up period while taking HAART (1 vs 0 on medians, p &lt; 0.001). The incidence of IRIS in advanced adult HIV-infected patients in Thailand was lower than that reported from Europe and the United States, which may be attributable to deferment of HAART after diagnosing opportunistic infections.",M1

From August 2004 to March 2006, 26 children were enrolled and started on a first-line HAART regimen, which was continued for 18 months. The study included a directly observed therapy phase (months 1-3) and a medication self-administration phase (months 4-18). CD4 percentage (CD4%) and HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load (PVL) were measured at baseline and at months 6, 12, and 18. At baseline, the median age was 5.5 years (range: 13 months-12 years), the median CD4% was 4, and the median PVL was 7.5x10(5) copies/ml. At 18 months, 23 (88%) children were alive and participating in the study. Of these children, 20 (87%) had a PVL &lt;400 copies/ml and 12 (52%) had PVL &lt; 50 copies/ml. The median CD4% increased to 23, while the median change in height-for-weight z-score was 0.64. Genotypic resistance typing in 2 children with PVL &gt; 400 copies/ml at 18 months demonstrated mutations associated with resistance to lamivudine (M184V) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Y181C and G190A). The virologic and immunologic outcomes achieved in this study compare favorably with those reported by other pediatric HIV treatment programs worldwide. The study results suggest that MDOT may be effective for HAART administration in limited-resource settings like Cambodia.",M1

Most HIV-1 vaccine development has focused on inducing immunity to conserved regions of the HIV-1 envelope. However, new studies of the sequence-variable regions of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein have shown that there are conserved immunological and structural features in these regions. Recombinant immunogens that include these features may provide the means to address the antigenic diversity of HIV-1 and induce protective antibodies that can prevent infection with HIV-1.",M1
20577155,"Routine jail-based <e>HIV</e> testing - Rhode Island, 2000-2007.The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among incarcerated persons in the United States (1.5%) is approximately four times greater than the prevalence among persons in community settings (0.4%). In 2006, CDC recommended HIV testing in correctional facilities and elsewhere as part of routine medical evaluation. However, jail-based testing can be difficult logistically because of rapid turnover among detainees. In 2009, the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) reviewed its HIV testing program to assess HIV case identification, characterize HIV risk factors, and estimate the proportion of detainees who might not have been tested if testing had been delayed. RIDOC reviewed records of HIV testing of jail detainees during 2000-2007. During this period, 102,229 HIV tests were administered (representing an estimated 40,000-60,000 unique jail detainees), and HIV infection was newly diagnosed in 169 detainees, including 80 (48%) with unknown HIV risk factors. HIV testing was completed within 24 hours of jail admission. If HIV testing had been delayed for 7 days, 72 detainees (43%) would have been released before they could be tested, resulting in a delay in their HIV diagnosis and care, and continued risk for HIV transmission. To maximize case identification, all detainees should be offered voluntary HIV testing early in their incarceration as part of the first clinical evaluation, regardless of reported risk factors.",M1
20577154,"Expanded <e>HIV</e> testing and trends in diagnoses of HIV infection - District of Columbia, 2004-2008.In the District of Columbia (DC), the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) case rate is nearly 10 times the U.S. rate and higher than comparable U.S. cities, such as Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, Detroit, and Chicago. In June 2006, the DC Department of Health (DCDOH) began implementing CDC's 2006 recommendations for routine, voluntary HIV screening in health-care settings. To describe recent trends in HIV disease and testing, CDC and DCDOH analyzed DC HIV case surveillance data, HIV testing data, and data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that the rate of newly diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases decreased consistently, from 164 cases per 100,000 in 2004 to 137 in 2007 and 107 in 2008. Among newly diagnosed AIDS cases, the number and rate were higher among blacks/African Americans compared with whites and Hispanics/Latinos. During 2005-2007, BRFSS results showed a significant increase in the proportion of the population that had been tested for HIV within the past 12 months, from 15% to 19%. Although the causes of the improvement in these indicators are unknown and cannot be linked to any specific intervention, they suggest improvements in the delivery of HIV testing and linkage to care services in DC. To address continuing racial disparities, DCDOH has increased HIV education and prevention efforts through enhanced collaborations, working with DC residents as spokespersons for local marketing campaigns and creating toolkits for health-care providers to expand HIV testing and linkage to care.",M1
20575314,"Factors related to attrition in a cohort study of <e>HIV</e> in Malawi.BACKGROUND: Longitudinal studies face power reduction due to loss to follow up (LTFU). Bias may also arise because of differences between those who stay in the study and those who are LTFU. We studied factors associated with LTFU in a cohort of HIV seronegative and sera-positive mothers in urban Malawi. OBJECTIVE: To bridge the existing gaps by examining the factors associated with attrition. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) and the Kamuzu Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. SUBJECTS: One thousand three hundred and fifty three women who attended the prenatal clinic, between October 1989 and October 1990 were recruited as part of a study to determine rates and risk factors of sero-prevalence and sera-conversion of HIV-1 among this cohort. RESULTS: In this cohort study, 1353 women were enrolled at delivery and 1188 (88%) returned for the first follow-up visit at three months post-partum. Of those who returned, 177 (15%) were subsequently lost during the remaining months of follow-up. The main predictors of LTFU were younger maternal age, lower educational level of the father, HIV infection of the mother, lower birth weight of the index child and mother not being married.

SUBJECTS: HIV-infected children below age of 15 years seen in a network of 18 clinics in Western Kenya. INTERVENTIONS: Paediatric HIV diagnosis and care including treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections and provision of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis, clinical stage and immune status at enrollment and follow-up; hospitalisation and death. Descriptive statistical analyses and chi square tests were performed. RESULTS: Four thousand and seventeen HIV-infected children seen between June 2002 and April 2008. Median age at enrollment was four years (0-14.2 years), 51% girls, 25% paternal orphans, 10% total orphans and 13% maternal orphans. At enrollment, 25% had weight-for-Age Z scores (WAZ) &gt; or = -1 and 21% had WAZ scores &lt; or = 3. Orphaned children had worse WAZ scores (p=0.0001). Twenty five per cent of children were classified as WHO clinical stage 3 and 4, 56% were WHO clinical stages 1 and 2 with 19% missing clinical staging at enrollment. Cough (25%), gastroenteritis (21%), fever (15%), pneumonia (10%) were the commonest presenting features. Twenty six per cent had been diagnosed with tuberculosis and only 25% started on cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT). Median CD4% at enrollment was 16% (0-64%); latest recorded values were 22% (0-64). Sixty four per cent were on cART (cART+), median age at start was 5.4 (014.4 years). The median initial CD4% among cART+ was 13 (0-62) compared to 24 (0-64) for those not on ART (cART-). Median CD4% for cART+ improved to 22% (0-59); whereas cART- was 23% (0-64) at last appointment. During the period of follow-up, one fifth (19%) of children on cART were lost to follow-up compared to slightly over one third (37%) for those not on cART. Thirty four percent were hospitalised; 41% diagnosed with pneumonia. Six per cent of 4017 were confirmed dead. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected children were enrolled in care early in childhood. Orphanhood was prevalent in these children as were gastroenteritis, fever, pneumonia and advanced immuno-suppression. Orphans were more likely to be severely malnourished. Only a quarter of children were put on cotrimoxazole preventive therapy. Children commenced on cART late but responded well to treatment. Loss to follow-up was less prevalent among those on cART.",M1
20575215,"Race and <e>HIV</e> clinical trial participation.PURPOSE: This study was designed to examine at the role race/ethnicity plays in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinical trial enrollment. BACKGROUND: HIV clinical trials are vitally important for improving knowledge about medications and their impact on the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS. African Americans are disproportionately underrepresented in HIV clinical trials. METHODS: A 49-item survey was administered to 145 patients at an urban HIV clinic to explore race and HIV clinical trial participation. RESULTS: Study participants were 56% Caucasian, 19% other, 16% African American, and 13% Hispanic. Fewer African Americans had been asked to participate in a trial compared to other groups (8% vs. 24%) (p &lt; .05). African Americans were less likely to volunteer for a trial compared to Hispanics and Caucasians, but African Americans did not differ significantly in their willingness participate in clinical trials vs. other racial groups. In a regression model age, past trial participation, monetary gain, and comfort with the clinical setting predicted willingness to participate in a trial across racial groups (p &lt; .05). DISCUSSION: There is a strong need to identify strategies to increase African American enrollment in trials. Such strategies need to begin with trial recruiters actively seeking out African Americans for clinical trial enrollment.",M1
20572597,"Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in a patient with peritoneal mesothelioma and <e>HIV</e> infection.BACKGROUND: High rates of septic complications have been associated with cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, which has been suggested as the treatment of choice for isolated peritoneal malignancies. Patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are still considered at a high operative risk. METHOD: A 58-year-old man with HIV infection and diffuse peritoneal mesothelioma underwent optimal cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. RESULTS: The patient experienced a complete clinical response to therapy with no adverse effect on disease course or markers for HIV (CD4 count, beta2-microglobulin, neopterin, p24 antigen, and viral load). CONCLUSION: This report suggests that this innovative approach can be successfully performed also in this clinical setting. In selected patients who respond to all criteria, surgery is possible and is a safe and effective therapeutic option.",M1

METHODS: We describe clinical, pathological, immunological, and therapeutic long-term follow-up of a cohort of 25 individuals with leprosy and HIV infection from Manaus, Amazonas. RESULTS: Careful description of our cohort indicates a higher prevalence of leprosy in an HIV-positive population than that in the general population. We also observed upgrading shifting of leprosy clinical forms after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy and multidrug therapy and an impact of HIV infection on leprosy granuloma formation, among other features. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these new insights allow the proposition of a classification system that includes (1) leprosy and HIV true coinfection, (2) opportunistic leprosy disease, and (3) leprosy related to highly active antiretroviral therapy.",M1

Unfortunately, HIV-infected subjects show a low rate of response to standard HBV vaccination (23%-56%), in contrast to rates &gt;90% found in the general population, and the underlying causes (particularly cellular and molecular causes) are still unknown. We hypothesized that an increased frequency of regulatory T (T(reg)) cells could be involved in the low rate of seroconversion in HIV-infected subjects. Forty HIV-infected subjects were enrolled in the Assistance Vaccination Program against HBV of the Infectious Diseases Service from the Virgen del Rocío University Hospital, Seville, Spain. Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from baseline were immunophenotyped for T(reg) cells, CD4, and CD8 T cells in both naive and memory subpopulations and activation degree, as well as recent thymic emigrants. Baseline T(reg) cell frequency was found independently associated with the final nonresponse to HBV vaccine in HIV-infected subjects. Furthermore, a negative correlation between baseline frequency of T(reg) cells and antibody titers in the final response was found. These findings suggest an active role played by T(reg) cells on the immunization antigen-specific T and/or B cell responses with the final consequence of a B cell anti-HBs lower production.",M1

Yet temporal sequence and causality have been questioned, and few HIV prevention programmes address these issues. We assessed whether intimate partner violence and relationship power inequity increase risk of incident HIV infection in South African women. METHODS: We did a longitudinal analysis of data from a previously published cluster-randomised controlled trial undertaken in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa in 2002-06. 1099 women aged 15-26 years who were HIV negative at baseline and had at least one additional HIV test over 2 years of follow-up were included in the analysis. Gender power equity and intimate partner violence were measured by a sexual relationship power scale and the WHO violence against women instrument, respectively. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of HIV acquisition at 2 years were derived from Poisson models, adjusted for study design and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection, and used to calculate population attributable fractions. FINDINGS: 128 women acquired HIV during 2076 person-years of follow-up (incidence 6.2 per 100 person-years). 51 of 325 women with low relationship power equity at baseline acquired HIV (8.5 per 100 person-years) compared with 73 of 704 women with medium or high relationship power equity (5.5 per 100 person-years); adjusted multivariable Poisson model IRR 1.51, 95% CI 1.05-2.17, p=0.027. 45 of 253 women who reported more than one episode of intimate partner violence at baseline acquired HIV (9.6 per 100 person-years) compared with 83 of 846 who reported one or no episodes (5.2 per 100 person-years); adjusted multivariable Poisson model IRR 1.51, 1.04-2.21, p=0.032. The population attributable fractions were 13.9% (95% CI 2.0-22.2) for relationship power equity and 11.9% (1.4-19.3) for intimate partner violence. INTERPRETATION: Relationship power inequity and intimate partner violence increase risk of incident HIV infection in young South African women. Policy, interventions, and programmes for HIV prevention must address both of these risk factors and allocate appropriate resources.

20557927,"Nurse versus doctor management of <e>HIV</e>-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (CIPRA-SA): a randomised non-inferiority trial.BACKGROUND: Expanded access to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-poor settings is dependent on task shifting from doctors to other health-care providers. We compared outcomes of nurse versus doctor management of ART care for HIV-infected patients. METHODS: This randomised non-inferiority trial was undertaken at two South African primary-care clinics. HIV-positive individuals with a CD4 cell count of less than 350 cells per microL or WHO stage 3 or 4 disease were randomly assigned to nurse-monitored or doctor-monitored ART care. Patients were randomly assigned by stratified permuted block randomisation, and neither the patients nor those analysing the data were masked to assignment. The primary objective was a composite endpoint of treatment-limiting events, incorporating mortality, viral failure, treatment-limiting toxic effects, and adherence to visit schedule. Analysis was by intention to treat. Non-inferiority of the nurse versus doctor group for cumulative treatment failure was prespecified as an upper 95% CI for the hazard ratio that was less than 1.40. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00255840. FINDINGS: 408 patients were assigned to doctor-monitored ART care and 404 to nurse-monitored ART care; all participants were analysed. 371 (46%) patients reached an endpoint of treatment failure: 192 (48%) in the nurse group and 179 (44%) in the doctor group. The hazard ratio for composite failure was 1.09 (95% CI 0.89-1.33), which was within the limits for non-inferiority. After a median follow-up of 120 weeks (IQR 60-144), deaths (ten vs 11), virological failures (44 vs 39), toxicity failures (68 vs 66), and programme losses (70 vs 63) were similar in nurse and doctor groups, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Nurse-monitored ART is non-inferior to doctor-monitored therapy. Findings from this study lend support to task shifting to appropriately trained nurses for monitoring of ART.

Controls were matched to cases on the basis of the time from birth when the breast milk sample was collected. The risk of MTCT was inversely related to breast milk erythropoietin concentration (adjusted odds ratio for highest vs lowest erythropoietin concentration tertile, 0.34 [95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.82]; [Formula: see text]).

20557194,"Seroepidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii infection in patients with vision and hearing impairments, cancer, <e>HIV</e>, or undergoing hemodialysis in Durango, Mexico.Toxoplasma gondii infection may cause a variety of symptoms involving virtually all organs. Little is known of the epidemiology of T. gondii infection in different patient groups in Mexico. We sought to determine the prevalence of T. gondii infection and associated epidemiological characteristics in 472 patients in Durango, Mexico. Participants were tested for T. gondii IgG and IgM antibodies. In addition, sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics from each participant were obtained. Seroprevalences of T. gondii IgG antibodies were found in 7 (8.2%) of 85 patients with hearing impairment, 5 (10.0%) of 50 patients with hemodialysis, 28 (12.0%) of 234 patients with visual impairment, and 7 (6.8%) of 103 at risk of immunosuppression. In total, 47 (10%) of 472 subjects had IgG T. gondii antibodies; 6 (1.3%) of them also had IgM anti- T. gondii antibodies. Patients born in Durango State had a significantly lower prevalence of T. gondii infection than patients born in other Mexican states (9.0% vs. 21.4%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that T. gondii infection was significantly associated with consumption of undercooked meat (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-7.35) or raw cow's milk (adjusted OR = 2.52; 95% CI: 1.28-4.96), presence of cats at home (adjusted OR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.06-3.78), raising animals (adjusted OR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.06-5.63), or eating away from home (adjusted OR = 2.70; 95% CI: 1.03-7.11). In the group of patients with visual impairment, those with reflex impairment had a significantly higher frequency of T. gondii infection than those with normal reflexes (19% vs. 9.4%, respectively: P = 0.04).

20556924,"Nutritional treatment for ambulatory patients with acquired immunodeficiency virus infection and previous weight loss using a formula enriched with n3 fatty acids: a randomized prospective trial.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dietary counseling and oral supplementation have unclear results in preventing the progressive weight loss in human deficiency virus (<e>HIV</e>)-infection. The aim of the study was to compare the progression of nutritional indicators with or without a formula enriched with n-3 fatty acids. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 30 HIV patients were enrolled. 15 were randomized to group I (standard formula) and 15 were randomized to group II (formula enriched with n-3 fatty acids). A nutritional evaluation was realized at basal time and at 3 months. RESULTS: An increase in protein and calories intakes was detected in both. There was a significant increase in n3 fatty acid intake from baseline in group II, without statistical changes in group I. Treatment with both supplements resulted in a significant and sustained increase in weight (4.5% in group I and 5.4%, in group II). This increase was mostly due to fat free mass in group I. In group II it was due to an increase in fat free mass and fat mass. CONCLUSIONS: Oral nutritional supplements for a 3-months period were well tolerated and resulted in body weight gain in HIV-infected patients with previous weight loss.",M1

METHODS: We randomly assigned 560 HIV-1-infected pregnant women (CD4+ count, &gt; or = 200 cells per cubic millimeter) to receive coformulated abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine (the nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor [NRTI] group) or lopinavir-ritonavir plus zidovudine-lamivudine (the protease-inhibitor group) from 26 to 34 weeks' gestation through planned weaning by 6 months post partum. A total of 170 women with CD4+ counts of less than 200 cells per cubic millimeter received nevirapine plus zidovudine-lamivudine (the observational group). Infants received single-dose nevirapine and 4 weeks of zidovudine. RESULTS: The rate of virologic suppression to less than 400 copies per milliliter was high and did not differ significantly among the three groups at delivery (96% in the NRTI group, 93% in the protease-inhibitor group, and 94% in the observational group) or throughout the breast-feeding period (92% in the NRTI group, 93% in the protease-inhibitor group, and 95% in the observational group). By 6 months of age, 8 of 709 live-born infants (1.1%) were infected (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5 to 2.2): 6 were infected in utero (4 in the NRTI group, 1 in the protease-inhibitor group, and 1 in the observational group), and 2 were infected during the breast-feeding period (in the NRTI group). Treatment-limiting adverse events occurred in 2% of women in the NRTI group, 2% of women in the protease-inhibitor group, and 11% of women in the observational group. CONCLUSIONS: All regimens of HAART from pregnancy through 6 months post partum resulted in high rates of virologic suppression, with an overall rate of mother-to-child transmission of 1.1%.

20554982,"Maternal or infant antiretroviral drugs to reduce <e>HIV</e>-1 transmission.BACKGROUND: We evaluated the efficacy of a maternal triple-drug antiretroviral regimen or infant nevirapine prophylaxis for 28 weeks during breast-feeding to reduce postnatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in Malawi. METHODS: We randomly assigned 2369 HIV-1-positive, breast-feeding mothers with a CD4+ lymphocyte count of at least 250 cells per cubic millimeter and their infants to receive a maternal antiretroviral regimen, infant nevirapine, or no extended postnatal antiretroviral regimen (control group). All mothers and infants received perinatal prophylaxis with single-dose nevirapine and 1 week of zidovudine plus lamivudine. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the cumulative risk of HIV-1 transmission or death by 28 weeks among infants who were HIV-1-negative 2 weeks after birth. Rates were compared with the use of the log-rank test. RESULTS: Among mother-infant pairs, 5.0% of infants were HIV-1-positive at 2 weeks of life. The estimated risk of HIV-1 transmission between 2 and 28 weeks was higher in the control group (5.7%) than in either the maternal-regimen group (2.9%, P=0.009) or the infant-regimen group (1.7%, P&lt;0.001). The estimated risk of infant HIV-1 infection or death between 2 and 28 weeks was 7.0% in the control group, 4.1% in the maternal-regimen group (P=0.02), and 2.6% in the infant-regimen group (P&lt;0.001). The proportion of women with neutropenia was higher among those receiving the antiretroviral regimen (6.2%) than among those in either the nevirapine group (2.6%) or the control group (2.3%). Among infants receiving nevirapine, 1.9% had a hypersensitivity reaction. CONCLUSIONS: The use of either a maternal antiretroviral regimen or infant nevirapine for 28 weeks was effective in reducing HIV-1 transmission during breast-feeding.

20554660,"AIDS and declining support for dependent elderly people in Africa: retrospective analysis using demographic and health surveys.OBJECTIVES: To determine the relation between the <e>HIV</e>/AIDS epidemic and support for dependent elderly people in Africa. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis using data from Demographic and Health Surveys. SETTING: 22 African countries between 1991 and 2006. PARTICIPANTS: 123,176 individuals over the age of 60. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We investigated how three measures of the living arrangements of older people have been affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic: the number of older individuals living alone (that is, the number of unattended elderly people); the number of older individuals living with only dependent children under the age of 10 (that is, in missing generation households); and the number of adults age 18-59 (that is, prime age adults) per household where an older person lives. RESULTS: An increase in annual AIDS mortality of one death per 1000 people was associated with a 1.5% increase in the proportion of older individuals living alone (95% CI 1.2% to 1.9%) and a 0.4% increase in the number of older individuals living in missing generation households (95% CI 0.3% to 0.6%). Increases in AIDS mortality were also associated with fewer prime age adults in households with at least one older person and at least one prime age adult (P&lt;0.001). These findings suggest that in our study countries, which encompass 70% of the sub-Saharan population, the HIV/AIDS epidemic could be responsible for 582,200-917,000 older individuals living alone without prime age adults and 141,000-323,100 older individuals being the sole caregivers for young children. CONCLUSIONS: Africa's HIV/AIDS epidemic might be responsible for a large number of older people losing their support and having to care for young children. This population has previously been under-recognised. Efforts to reduce HIV/AIDS deaths could have large  spillover  benefits for elderly people in Africa.",M1
20552760,"A conceptual model exploring the relationship between <e>HIV</e> stigma and implementing HIV clinical trials in rural communities of North Carolina.BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects minority groups in the United States, especially in the rural southeastern states. Poverty and lack of access to HIV care, including clinical trials, are prevalent in these areas and contribute to HIV stigma. This is the first study to develop a conceptual model exploring the relationship between HIV stigma and the implementation of HIV clinical trials in rural contexts to help improve participation in those trials. METHODS: We conducted focus groups with HIV service providers and community leaders, and individual interviews with people living with HIV/AIDS in six counties in rural North Carolina. Themes related to stigma were elicited. We classified the themes into theoretical constructs and developed a conceptual model. RESULTS: HIV stigma themes were classified under the existing theoretical constructs of perceived, experienced, vicarious, and felt normative stigma. Two additional constructs emerged: causes of HIV stigma (e.g., low HIV knowledge and denial in the community) and consequences of HIV stigma (e.g., confidentiality concerns in clinical trials). The conceptual model illustrates that the causes of HIV stigma can give rise to perceived, experienced, and vicarious HIV stigma, and these types of stigma could lead to the consequences of HIV stigma that include felt normative stigma. LIMITATIONS: Understanding HIV stigma in rural counties of North Carolina may not be generalizeable to other rural US southeastern states. CONCLUSION: The conceptual model emphasizes that HIV stigma--in its many forms--is a critical barrier to HIV clinical trial implementation in rural North Carolina.",M1

The organization of drug selling varied among the communities on a number of dimensions including: whether drug sales were open or closed systems; the type of drug-selling site; and the participation of drug users in drug-distribution roles. Drug-use sites also varied according to whether crack was used in private, semiprivate, or public spaces, and whether individuals used drugs alone or with other drug users. Three patterns of drug use and selling were identified based on the dimensions outlined above. Structural factors that influenced these patterns included the geographic location of the communities, their physical layout, gang involvement in drug sales, and police surveillance. Implications for HIV risk and prevention are explored for each pattern.",M1
20550075,"A model of cognitive decline and suicidal ideation in adults aging with <e>HIV</e>.The number of older adults with HIV continues to grow primarily because of the effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Despite this welcomed benefit from pharmaceutical advances, aging with this disease presents an entirely new set of problems. The combination of aging and HIV can create a variety of stressors that may weaken one's resolve and further debilitate already compromised cognitive systems, which may increase rates of depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide. Studies indicate that older adults with HIV experience higher levels of depression and suicidal ideation than other older adults do or than younger adults with HIV do. Cognitive declines associated with both HIV and aging may provide insight into this phenomenon. A model of cognitive decline and suicidal ideation in adults aging with HIV is provided. Implications for nursing practice and research are discussed.",M1
20550034,"Active tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus co-infection in Israel: a retrospective study.BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is the most common opportunistic infection among people infected with human immunodeficiency virus and its first cause of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the characteristics of a population in Israel with both tuberculosis disease and <e>HIV</e> infection in order to identify factors that contribute to outcome. METHODS: The study group comprised patients hospitalized in the Pulmonary and Tuberculosis Department of Shmuel Harofeh Hospital during the period January 2000 to December 2006. They were located by a computer search of the hospital registry and the pertinent data were collected. RESULTS: During the study period 1059 cases of active tuberculosis disease were hospitalized; 93 of them were co-infected with HIV. Most of them came from endemic countries (61.2% from Ethiopia and 20.4% from the former Soviet Union; none of them was born in Israel). Ten percent of the cases were multiple-drug resistant and 32% showed extrapulmonary involvement. The response rate to the treatment was good, and the median hospitalization time was 70 days. The mortality rate was 3.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of pulmonary disease in our group, the short-term outcome was good and the Mycobacterium was highly sensitive to first-line drugs. These encouraging results can be attributed to the fact that tuberculosis patients in Israel are identified early and treated continuously and strictly, with early initiation of antiretroviral therapy, which together ensure that the development of drug resistance is low.",M1

OBJECTIVE: To determine how many HIV cases can be identified with NAT and how many persons can be contacted, to identify predictors of acute and early HIV infection cases, and to test reporting of negative results by automated Internet and voicemail systems. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: San Diego County, California. PARTICIPANTS: Persons seeking HIV testing. MEASUREMENTS: Rates and predictors of HIV infection by stage, notification of positive NAT results, use of automated Internet or voicemail systems to access negative NAT results, and estimated HIV infections prevented. RESULTS: Of 3151 persons tested, 79 had newly diagnosed cases of HIV: 64 had positive results from rapid HIV test, and 15 had positive results only by NAT (that is, NAT increased the HIV detection yield by 23%). Of all HIV infections, 44% (in 35 persons) were in the acute and early stages. Most participants (56%) and persons with HIV (91%) were men who have sex with men (MSM). All persons with NAT-positive results were notified within 1 week. Of all 3070 uninfected patients, 2105 (69%) retrieved their negative NAT results, with 1358 using the Internet system. After adjustment for covariates, persons reporting MSM behavior, higher incomes, younger ages, no testing at substance abuse rehabilitation centers, no recent syphilis, and no methamphetamine use were more likely to access negative NAT results by either Internet or voicemail systems. LIMITATION: Findings may not be generalizable to other populations and testing programs. CONCLUSION: Nucleic acid testing programs that include automated systems for result reporting can increase case yield, especially in settings that cater to MSM.",M1

20547574,"Generalizing evidence from randomized clinical trials to target populations: The ACTG 320 trial.Properly planned and conducted randomized clinical trials remain susceptible to a lack of external validity. The authors illustrate a model-based method to standardize observed trial results to a specified target population using a seminal human immunodeficiency virus (<e>HIV</e>) treatment trial, and they provide Monte Carlo simulation evidence supporting the method. The example trial enrolled 1,156 HIV-infected adult men and women in the United States in 1996, randomly assigned 577 to a highly active antiretroviral therapy and 579 to a largely ineffective combination therapy, and followed participants for 52 weeks. The target population was US people infected with HIV in 2006, as estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results from the trial apply, albeit muted by 12%, to the target population, under the assumption that the authors have measured and correctly modeled the determinants of selection that reflect heterogeneity in the treatment effect. In simulations with a heterogeneous treatment effect, a conventional intent-to-treat estimate was biased with poor confidence limit coverage, but the proposed estimate was largely unbiased with appropriate confidence limit coverage. The proposed method standardizes observed trial results to a specified target population and thereby provides information regarding the generalizability of trial results.",M1

Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces plasma HIV-1 concentrations. We aimed to assess the effect of ART use by patients infected with HIV-1 on risk of transmission to their uninfected partners. METHODS: Participants in our prospective cohort analysis were from a randomised placebo-controlled trial that enrolled heterosexual African adults who were seropositive for both HIV-1 and herpes simplex virus type 2, and their HIV-1 seronegative partners. At enrolment, HIV-1 infected participants had CD4 counts of 250 cells per microL or greater and did not meet national guidelines for ART initiation; during 24 months of follow-up, CD4 counts were measured every 6 months and ART was initiated in accordance with national guidelines. Uninfected partners were tested for HIV-1 every 3 months. The primary outcome was genetically-linked HIV-1 transmission within the study partnership. We assessed rates of HIV-1 transmission by ART status of infected participants. FINDINGS: 3381 couples were eligible for analysis. 349 (10%) participants with HIV-1 initiated ART during the study, at a median CD4 cell count of 198 (IQR 161-265) cells per microL. Only one of 103 genetically-linked HIV-1 transmissions was from an infected participant who had started ART, corresponding to transmission rates of 0.37 (95% CI 0.09-2.04) per 100 person-years in those who had initiated treatment and 2.24 (1.84-2.72) per 100 person-years in those who had not-a 92% reduction (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.08, 95% CI 0.00-0.57, p=0.004). In participants not on ART, the highest HIV-1 transmission rate (8.79 per 100 person-years) was from those with CD4 cell counts lower than 200 cells per microL. In couples in whom the untreated HIV-1 infected partner had a CD4 cell count greater than 200 cells per microL, 66 (70%) of 94 transmissions occurred when plasma HIV-1 concentrations exceeded 50 000 copies per mL. INTERPRETATION: Low CD4 cell counts and high plasma HIV-1 concentrations might guide use of ART to achieve an HIV-1 prevention benefit. Provision of ART to HIV-1 infected patients could be an effective strategy to achieve population-level reductions in HIV-1 transmission.

20533872,"Possible mitochondrial dysfunction and its association with antiretroviral therapy use in children perinatally infected with <e>HIV</e>.BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and exposure to antiretroviral therapy. Mitochondrial dysfunction has not been widely studied in HIV-infected children. We estimated the incidence of clinically defined mitochondrial dysfunction among children with perinatal HIV infection. METHODS: Children with perinatal HIV infection enrolled in a prospective cohort study (Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocols 219 and 219C) from 1993 through 2004 were included. Two clinical case definitions of mitochondrial dysfunction, the Enquête Périnatale Française criteria and the Mitochondrial Disease Classification criteria, were used to classify signs and symptoms that were consistent with possible mitochondrial dysfunction. Adjusted odds ratios of the associations between single and dual nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor use and possible mitochondrial dysfunction were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 982 (33.5%) of 2931 children met 1 or both case definitions of possible mitochondrial dysfunction. Mortality was highest among the 96 children who met both case definitions (20%). After adjusting for confounders, there was a higher risk of possible mitochondrial dysfunction among children who received stavudine regardless of exposure to other medications (odds ratio, 3.44 [95% confidence interval, 1.91-6.20]) or who received stavudine-didanosine combination therapy (odds ratio, 2.23 [95% confidence interval, 1.19-4.21]). Exposure to lamivudine and to lamivudine-stavudine were also associated with an increased risk of mitochondrial dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, especially stavudine and lamivudine, was associated with possible mitochondrial dysfunction in children with perinatal HIV infection. Further studies are warranted to elucidate potential mechanisms of nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor toxicities.",M1

Little is known about the HCV knowledge of PLWHA. METHODS: One hundred seventy-nine patients at an infectious disease clinic were interviewed on HCV knowledge and alcohol use. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of participants indicated that HCV is transmitted through blood; 53% indicated that persons with HIV-HCV co-infection can benefit from HCV treatment; and 79% and 74%, respectively, indicated that safer sex and safer injection techniques can prevent HCV transmission. Among PLWHA with self-reported HCV, 97% indicated that persons with HCV should not drink alcohol, but 32% reported using alcohol in the past 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Health education is needed to prevent HCV infections and increase HCV treatment-seeking. Higher education levels were related to more accurate HCV knowledge, indicating the need for health promotion for PLWHA of lower education levels.",M1

OBJECTIVES: To determine the adherence level of people living with <e>HIV</e>/AIDS (PLWHA) to HAART and identify associated factors. Methodology: A semistructured questionnaire was administered to PLWHA, who were accessing treatment. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, HIV medical, and drug history were obtained from them. Adherence was self-reported. Good adherence was taking of 95% of the prescribed doses of HAART over the preceding 30 days before consultation. RESULTS: Study participants were 253; majority, 58.5%, were females. About 70.8% of them had good adherence. Older age and male sex correlated better with adherence. CONCLUSION: People living with HIV/AIDS were quite adherent to HAART. Male sex and older age were positive predictors of adherence. Adherence among the young age and females needs strengthening.",M1
20530473,"Role of CD4 count in immunity development after hepatitis A and B vaccination among <e>HIV</e>-infected patients: Kentucky, 2002-2007.PURPOSE: To determine whether lower prevaccination CD4 counts decrease odds of immune development against hepatitis A virus/hepatitis B virus (HAV/HBV) among patients who receive the vaccine and examine the relationship between vaccine response and sex, race/ethnicity, health insurance status, tobacco use, substance abuse, or comorbidities. METHODS: This study was performed among patients who received the standard dose for HAV and/or HBV vaccine. RESULTS: Among 76 HIV-infected patients, immunity development to HAV or HBV increased as CD4 counts increased. In addition, males had greater vaccine response than females. Whites were observed to have higher rates of immunity than other races/ethnicities. Patients with private insurance had greater vaccine response than those with Medicaid, Medicare, or no insurance. Patients not experiencing hypertension and hyperlipidemia developed immunity more often than patients with these comorbidities. Substance abuse and tobacco use were also associated with lower vaccine response. CONCLUSIONS: Higher CD4 counts improved likelihood of patients developing an antibody response after vaccination.",M1

DESIGN: Body weight and composition, the latter determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and by anthropometry, were compared in 620 HIV-positive and 211 HIV-negative participants. Associations of HIV with body composition were assessed, and t tests compared the groups. RESULTS: HIV-positive women were younger (-7.0 years, P &lt; .001) and shorter (-2.1 cm, P &lt; .001). Mean body weight, body mass index (BMI), total body fat, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were similar. Mean fat-free mass was 2.5% greater in HIV-negative participants, and 19% of HIV-positive group had BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m(2) versus 26% of the HIV-negative group (P &lt; .05). CD4 counts and body composition were not associated. CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition was common in this cohort of Rwandan women. However, HIV infection was not associated with nutritional status. Factors other than malnutrition may influence quality-of-life outcomes in HIV-infected Rwandan women. Initiatives to improve nutritional status should be population-wide and not restricted to the HIV-infected population.",M1

The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) was completed by 234 individuals with HIV in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, and 284 in Eldoret, Kenya. The US-based sample expressed markedly higher levels of psychological distress symptoms on the anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsive, and psychoticism dimensions, as well as the overall global severity index. Substantial proportions of both the US and Kenya cohorts expressed higher levels of somatization and paranoid ideation that suggested further psychological evaluation.

METHODS: The geriatrics screening evaluated functional capabilities, depression, cognitive dysfunction, nutrition, mobility, medicines used, and interactions. RESULTS: As of July 2009, 57 patients were screened (average age 62.6, 39 males and 18 females). A total of 17 patients (9 males and 8 females) were referred to the geriatrics/HIV program because of identified problems in multiple domains: 10 with cognitive dysfunction, 8 with problems in basic or instrumental activities of daily living, 6 with nutritional issues, 5 with depression, 5 with mobility problems, 4 with visual issues, and 2 with hearing difficulties. The average age was 62.9. Median CD4 count and viral load were 285 (15-714) cells/mm(3) and 30 505 copies/mL (0-407 697), respectively.

METHODOLOGY: After signing an informed consent form, participants answered a sociodemographic and risk factor questionnaire. Fecal specimens from patients with HIV-infected and uninfected patients were screened for intestinal helminthiasis (IHLs) using coprological methods. RESULTS: A total of 146 patients were recruited, of those 66 were HIV-negative while 80 were HIV-negative patients. Thirty-five patients (12 HIV/AIDS and 23 non-HIV/AIDS) had helminthic infections. Hookworms were the most frequently detected helminths among patients living with HIV/AIDS (13.6%) and HIV-negative patients (17.5%), followed by schistosomiasis (9%) detected among HIV-negative individuals only. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of helminthiases (HLs) was observed to be relatively lower among HIV-infected than uninfected patients, which is ascribable to prophylactic measures adopted for patients with HIV/AIDS. Thus, it is recommended that routine screening for HLs and prophylactic measures should be adopted for the improvement of patients' health status.",M1

METHOD: A total of 180 healthy individuals and 150 <e>HIV</e>-positive patients were recruited. All individuals were genotyped for CCR5 polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and CCR2 and SDF1 polymorphism using PCR restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLPs). RESULTS: No CCR5-Delta32 mutation was found. CCR2-64I frequency was 24.7% in the healthy group and 20.3% in the HIV-positive group, and SDF1-3'A was 30.6% and 29.3% in the 2 groups, respectively. There were no significances in the frequencies of CCR2-64I (chi(2) = 1.795, P = .180) and SDF1-3'A (chi(2) = 0.116, P = .733) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The protective CCR5-Delta32 mutation is absent in the Zhuang population, but CCR2-64I and SDF1-3'A are relatively common and seem not to confer protection against HIV-1 infection. The results suggest that the Zhuang people may have a similar genetic susceptibility to HIV-1 infection with most other Chinese ethnic groups.",M1

Sociodemographics, injection practices, beliefs about and experiences with pharmacy use, and medical/social service utilization were compared among 29 IDUs purchasing syringes from intervention pharmacies and 66 IDUs purchasing syringes from control pharmacies using chi-square tests. Intervention IDUs reported more positive experiences in pharmacies than controls; both groups were receptive to a greater public health pharmacist role. These data provide evidence that community-based participatory research aided in the implementation of a pilot structural intervention to promote understanding of drug use and HIV prevention among pharmacy staff, and facilitated expansion of pharmacy services beyond syringe sales in marginalized drug-using communities.",M1

20484498,"Structural basis for the inhibition of RNase H activity of <e>HIV</e>-1 reverse transcriptase by RNase H active site-directed inhibitors.HIV/AIDS continues to be a menace to public health. Several drugs currently on the market have successfully improved the ability to manage the viral burden in infected patients. However, new drugs are needed to combat the rapid emergence of mutated forms of the virus that are resistant to existing therapies. Currently, approved drugs target three of the four major enzyme activities encoded by the virus that are critical to the HIV life cycle. Although a number of inhibitors of HIV RNase H activity have been reported, few inhibit by directly engaging the RNase H active site. Here, we describe structures of naphthyridinone-containing inhibitors bound to the RNase H active site. This class of compounds binds to the active site via two metal ions that are coordinated by catalytic site residues, D443, E478, D498, and D549. The directionality of the naphthyridinone pharmacophore is restricted by the ordering of D549 and H539 in the RNase H domain. In addition, one of the naphthyridinone-based compounds was found to bind at a second site close to the polymerase active site and non-nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitor sites in a metal-independent manner. Further characterization, using fluorescence-based thermal denaturation and a crystal structure of the isolated RNase H domain reveals that this compound can also bind the RNase H site and retains the metal-dependent binding mode of this class of molecules. These structures provide a means for structurally guided design of novel RNase H inhibitors.",M2
20473303,"Rational design of small-molecule inhibitors of the LEDGF/p75-integrase interaction and <e>HIV</e> replication.Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) is a cellular cofactor of HIV-1 integrase that promotes viral integration by tethering the preintegration complex to the chromatin. By virtue of its crucial role in the early steps of HIV replication, the interaction between LEDGF/p75 and integrase represents an attractive target for antiviral therapy. We have rationally designed a series of 2-(quinolin-3-yl)acetic acid derivatives (LEDGINs) that act as potent inhibitors of the LEDGF/p75-integrase interaction and HIV-1 replication at submicromolar concentration by blocking the integration step. A 1.84-A resolution crystal structure corroborates the binding of the inhibitor in the LEDGF/p75-binding pocket of integrase. Together with the lack of cross-resistance with two clinical integrase inhibitors, these findings define the 2-(quinolin-3-yl)acetic acid derivatives as the first genuine allosteric HIV-1 integrase inhibitors. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of rational design of small molecules inhibiting the protein-protein interaction between a viral protein and a cellular host factor.",M2
20459757,"Diametrically opposed effects of hypoxia and oxidative stress on two viral transactivators.BACKGROUND: Many pathogens exist in multiple physiological niches within the host. Differences between aerobic and anaerobic conditions are known to alter the expression of bacterial virulence factors, typically through the conditional activity of transactivators that modulate their expression. More recently, changes in physiological niches have been shown to affect the expression of viral genes. For many viruses, differences in oxygen tension between hypoxia and normoxia alter gene expression or function. Oxygen tension also affects many mammalian transactivators including AP-1, NFkB, and p53 by affecting the reduced state of critical cysteines in these proteins. We have recently determined that an essential cys-x-x-cys motif in the EBNA1 transactivator of Epstein-Barr virus is redox-regulated, such that transactivation is favoured under reducing conditions. The crucial Tat transactivator of human immunodeficiency virus (<e>HIV</e>) has an essential cysteine-rich region, and is also regulated by redox. Contrary to EBNA1, it is reported that Tat's activity is increased by oxidative stress. Here we have compared the effects of hypoxia, oxidative stress, and cellular redox modulators on EBNA1 and Tat. RESULTS: Our results indicate that unlike EBNA1, Tat is less active during hypoxia. Agents that generate hydroxyl and superoxide radicals reduce EBNA1's activity but increase transactivation by Tat. The cellular redox modulator, APE1/Ref-1, increases EBNA1's activity, without any effect on Tat. Conversely, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TRR1) reduces Tat's function without any effect on EBNA1. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that oxygen partial pressure and oxidative stress affects the functions of EBNA1 and Tat in a dramatically opposed fashion. Tat is more active during oxidative stress, whereas EBNA1's activity is compromised under these conditions. The two proteins respond to differing cellular redox modulators, suggesting that the oxidized cysteine adduct is a disulfide bond(s) in Tat, but sulfenic acid in EBNA1. The effect of oxygen partial pressure on transactivator function suggests that changes in redox may underlie differences in virus-infected cells dependent upon the physiological niches they traffic to.",M2

Primary CD4(+) T cells were isolated from peripheral blood and amplified by antibodies to the T-cell receptor (TCR). The cells were then infected by lentiviral vectors carrying fluorescent reporters and either the wild-type Tat gene or the attenuated H13L Tat gene. After sorting for the positive cells and reamplification, the infected cells were allowed to spontaneously enter latency by long-term cultivation on the H80 feeder cell line in the absence of TCR stimulation. By 6 weeks almost all of the cells lost fluorescent protein marker expression; however, more than 95% of these latently infected cells could be reactivated after stimulation of the TCR by alpha-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that, analogously to Jurkat T cells, latent proviruses in primary CD4(+) T cells are enriched in heterochromatic markers, including high levels of CBF-1, histone deacetylases, and methylated histones. Upon TCR activation, there was recruitment of NF-kappaB to the promoter and conversion of heterochromatin structures present on the latent provirus to active euchromatin structures containing acetylated histones. Surprisingly, latently infected primary cells cannot be induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha because of a restriction in P-TEFb levels, which can be overcome by activation of the TCR. Thus, a combination of restrictive chromatin structures at the HIV long terminal repeat and limiting P-TEFb levels contribute to transcriptional silencing leading to latency in primary CD4(+) T cells.",M2
20380700,"Limelight on two <e>HIV</e>/SIV accessory proteins in macrophage infection: is Vpx overshadowing Vpr?HIV viruses encode a set of accessory proteins, which are important determinants of virulence due to their ability to manipulate the host cell physiology for the benefit of the virus. Although these viral proteins are dispensable for viral growth in many in vitro cell culture systems, they influence the efficiency of viral replication in certain cell types. Macrophages are early targets of HIV infection which play a major role in viral dissemination and persistence in the organism. This review focuses on two HIV accessory proteins whose functions might be more specifically related to macrophage infection: Vpr, which is conserved across primate lentiviruses including HIV-1 and HIV-2, and Vpx, a protein genetically related to Vpr, which is unique to HIV-2 and a subset of simian lentiviruses. Recent studies suggest that both Vpr and Vpx exploit the host ubiquitination machinery in order to inactivate specific cellular proteins. We review here why it remains difficult to decipher the role of Vpr in macrophage infection by HIV-1 and how recent data underscore the ability of Vpx to antagonize a restriction factor which counteracts synthesis of viral DNA in monocytic cells.",M2

20368329,"Combinatorial signals from CD28 differentially regulate human immunodeficiency virus transcription in T cells.Activation through the T-cell receptor and the costimulatory receptor CD28 supports efficient <e>HIV</e> transcription as well as reactivation of latent provirus. To characterize critical signals associated with CD28 that regulate HIV-1 transcription, we generated a library of chimeric CD28 receptors that harbored different combinations of key tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail, Tyr-173, Tyr-188, Tyr-191, and Tyr-200. We found that Tyr-191 and Tyr-200 induce HIV-1 transcription via the activation of NF-kappaB and its recruitment to the HIV-long terminal repeat. Tyr-188 modifies positive and negative signals associated with CD28. Importantly, signaling through Tyr-188, Tyr-191, and Tyr-200 is required to overcome the inhibition posed by Tyr-173. CD28 also regulates P-TEFb activity, which is necessary for HIV-1 transcription processivity, by limiting the release of P-TEFb from the HEXIM1-7SK inhibitory complex in response to T-cell receptor signaling. Our studies reveal that CD28 regulates HIV-1 provirus transcription through a complex interplay of positive and negative signals that may be manipulated to control HIV-1 transcription and replication.",M2

20361047,"Drug-class specific impact of antivirals on the reproductive capacity of <e>HIV</e>.Predictive markers linking drug efficacy to clinical outcome are a key component in the drug discovery and development process. In HIV infection, two different measures, viral load decay and phenotypic assays, are used to assess drug efficacy in vivo and in vitro. For the newly introduced class of integrase inhibitors, a huge discrepancy between these two measures of efficacy was observed. Hence, a thorough understanding of the relation between these two measures of drug efficacy is imperative for guiding future drug discovery and development activities in HIV. In this article, we developed a novel viral dynamics model, which allows for a mechanistic integration of the mode of action of all approved drugs and drugs in late clinical trials. Subsequently, we established a link between in vivo and in vitro measures of drug efficacy, and extract important determinants of drug efficacy in vivo. The analysis is based on a new quantity-the reproductive capacity-that represents in mathematical terms the in vivo analog of the read-out of a phenotypic assay. Our results suggest a drug-class specific impact of antivirals on the total amount of viral replication. Moreover, we showed that the (drug-)target half life, dominated by immune-system related clearance processes, is a key characteristic that affects both the emergence of resistance as well as the in vitro-in vivo correlation of efficacy measures in HIV treatment. We found that protease- and maturation inhibitors, due to their target half-life, decrease the total amount of viral replication and the emergence of resistance most efficiently.",M2

METHODOLOGY: Conducted between August 2007 and February 2008 in Roumieh Prison, Lebanon, the study included a total of 580 male prisoners aged 16 and above who were randomly selected from four prison blocks. Peripheral blood was collected by a finger prick, blotted onto high-quality filter paper, dried and later eluted to be tested for markers of HIV, HBV and HCV infections. RESULTS: A significantly higher seroprevalence of HBV (2.4%) and HCV (3.4%) was found among prisoners compared to the seroprevalence of these virus infections reported in the general Lebanese population (&lt; 1% for HBV and HCV). Only one of the 580 prisoners tested (0.17%) was confirmed as anti-HIV-positive. The majority (89%) of anti-HCV-positive prisoners had a history of previous imprisonment and were injecting drug users (IDUs). Tattooing was also associated with HCV transmission: all nine anti-HCV-positive prisoners had tattoos compared to only 60% who were anti-HCV-negative. Only HCV genotypes 1 and 3 were detected. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence for an outbreak of HCV and HBV occurring in Roumieh prison. In addition to vaccinating prisoners against HBV, collaborations should develop between the prison's administration, academic institutions, and community-based organizations to provide HCV prevention services within the prisons.",M2
20335932,"Detection of <e>HIV</e> cDNA point mutations with rolling-circle amplification arrays.In this paper we describe an isothermal rolling-circle amplification (RCA) protocol to detect gene point mutations on chips. The method is based on an allele-specific oligonucleotide circularization mediated by a special DNA ligase. The probe is circularized when perfect complementary sequences between the probe oligonucleotide and HIV cDNA gene. Mismatches around the ligation site can prevent probe circularization. The circularized probe (C-probe) can be amplified by rolling circle amplification to generate multimeric singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) under isothermal conditions. There are four sequence regions to bind respectively with fluorescent probe, RCA primer, solid probe and HIV cDNA template in the C-probe which we designed. These ssDNA products are hybridized with fluorescent probes and solid probes which are immobilized on a glass slide composing a regular microarray pattern. The fluorescence signals can be monitored by a scanner in the presence of HIV cDNA templates, whereas the probes cannot be circularized and signal of fluorescence cannot be found. The RCA array has capability of high-throughput detection of the point mutation and the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).The development of C-probe-based technologies offers a promising prospect for situ detection, microarray, molecular diagnosis, single nucleotide polymorphism, and whole genome amplification.",M2
20333245,"Estimating the stoichiometry of <e>HIV</e> neutralization.HIV-1 virions infect target cells by first establishing contact between envelope glycoprotein trimers on the virion's surface and CD4 receptors on a target cell, recruiting co-receptors, fusing with the cell membrane and finally releasing the genetic material into the target cell. Specific experimental setups allow the study of the number of trimer-receptor-interactions needed for infection, i.e., the stoichiometry of entry and also the number of antibodies needed to prevent one trimer from engaging successfully in the entry process, i.e., the stoichiometry of (trimer) neutralization. Mathematical models are required to infer the stoichiometric parameters from these experimental data. Recently, we developed mathematical models for the estimations of the stoichiometry of entry [1]. In this article, we show how our models can be extended to investigate the stoichiometry of trimer neutralization. We study how various biological parameters affect the estimate of the stoichiometry of neutralization. We find that the distribution of trimer numbers-which is also an important determinant of the stoichiometry of entry-influences the estimated value of the stoichiometry of neutralization. In contrast, other parameters, which characterize the experimental system, diminish the information we can extract from the data about the stoichiometry of neutralization, and thus reduce our confidence in the estimate. We illustrate the use of our models by re-analyzing previously published data on the neutralization sensitivity [2], which contains measurements of neutralization sensitivity of viruses with different envelope proteins to antibodies with various specificities. Our mathematical framework represents the formal basis for the estimation of the stoichiometry of neutralization. Together with the stoichiometry of entry, the stoichiometry of trimer neutralization will allow one to calculate how many antibodies are required to neutralize a virion or even an entire population of virions.",M2
20298574,"Anti-infective activity of apolipoprotein domain derived peptides in vitro: identification of novel antimicrobial peptides related to apolipoprotein B with anti-<e>HIV</e> activity.BACKGROUND: Previous reports have shown that peptides derived from the apolipoprotein E receptor binding region and the amphipathic alpha-helical domains of apolipoprotein AI have broad anti-infective activity and antiviral activity respectively. Lipoproteins and viruses share a similar cell biological niche, being of overlapping size and displaying similar interactions with mammalian cells and receptors, which may have led to other antiviral sequences arising within apolipoproteins, in addition to those previously reported. We therefore designed a series of peptides based around either apolipoprotein receptor binding regions, or amphipathic alpha-helical domains, and tested these for antiviral and antibacterial activity. RESULTS: Of the nineteen new peptides tested, seven showed some anti-infective activity, with two of these being derived from two apolipoproteins not previously used to derive anti-infective sequences. Apolipoprotein J (151-170) - based on a predicted amphipathic alpha-helical domain from apolipoprotein J - had measurable anti-HSV1 activity, as did apolipoprotein B (3359-3367) dp (apoBdp), the latter being derived from the LDL receptor binding domain B of apolipoprotein B. The more active peptide - apoBdp - showed similarity to the previously reported apoE derived anti-infective peptide, and further modification of the apoBdp sequence to align the charge distribution more closely to that of apoEdp or to introduce aromatic residues resulted in increased breadth and potency of activity. The most active peptide of this type showed similar potent anti-HIV activity, comparable to that we previously reported for the apoE derived peptide apoEdpL-W. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that further antimicrobial peptides may be obtained using human apolipoprotein sequences, selecting regions with either amphipathic alpha-helical structure, or those linked to receptor-binding regions. The finding that an amphipathic alpha-helical region of apolipoprotein J has antiviral activity comparable with that for the previously reported apolipoprotein AI derived peptide 18A, suggests that full-length apolipoprotein J may also have such activity, as has been reported for full-length apolipoprotein AI. Although the strength of the anti-infective activity of the sequences identified was limited, this could be increased substantially by developing related mutant peptides. Indeed the apolipoprotein B-derived peptide mutants uncovered by the present study may have utility as HIV therapeutics or microbicides.",M2

However, the entry mechanisms of these viruses into cells are not fully understood. Until recently, entry of HIV-1 into CD4/CR expressing cells was believed to occur by fusion of viral envelope to the target cellular membrane at lipid rafts in a pH-independent manner.

The viruses show similarities and differences in biological and pathogenic features. The basic retroviral genomic organization is complicated by the presence of a variable number of accessory genes in both viruses, though the structure is more complex in HIV. Both are mucosal pathogens, and infect cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. The main difference in cell tropism is that, unlike HIV, SRLV do not infect lymphocytes. A major feature of both pathogens is restricted replication and virus latency, which are partly responsible for the establishment of chronic infection usually lasting for life. The pathologies observed are similar in the early stages of both infections, and possibly following highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). While the pathogenesis of HIV-induced disease during symptomatic stages is mainly due to secondary infections and neoplastic conditions, the early and post-HAART stages are associated with chronic inflammatory changes that resemble those found in SRLV diseases which are thought to be mediated by anti-virus immune responses.",M2

The development of efficient and low-cost microbicides to prevent sexual transmission of HIV should be given high priority because there is no vaccine available yet. Cyanovirin-N (CVN) is an entry inhibitor of HIV and many other viruses, and it represents a new generation of microbicide that has specific and potent activity, a different mechanism of action, and unusual chemicophysical stability. In vitro and in vivo antiviral tests suggested that the anti-HIV effect of CVN is stronger than a well-known gp120-targeted antibody (2G12) and another microbicide candidate, PRO2000. CVN is a cyanobacteria-derived protein that has special structural features, making the artificial production of this protein very difficult. In order to develop an efficient and relatively low-cost approach for large-scale production of recombinant CVN to satisfy medical use, this protein has been expressed in many systems by trial and error.

20149939,"Host genes associated with <e>HIV</e>/AIDS: advances in gene discovery.Twenty-five years after the discovery of HIV as the cause of AIDS there is still no effective vaccine and no cure for this disease. HIV susceptibility shows a substantial degree of individual heterogeneity, much of which can be conferred by host genetic variation. In an effort to discover host factors required for HIV replication, identify crucial pathogenic pathways, and reveal the full armament of host defenses, there has been a shift from candidate-gene studies to unbiased genome-wide genetic and functional studies. However, the number of securely identified host factors involved in HIV disease remains small, explaining only approximately 15-20% of the observed heterogeneity - most of which is attributable to human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) variants.

Weight, body mass index (BMI), arm muscle area (AMA), arm fat area (AFA) and the serum concentration of the acute-phase protein alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin (serum ACT) were evaluated for each of 532 cases of PTB and 150 'non-TB' controls. On average, the female cases of PTB not only weighed 7.8 kg less but also had BMI that were 3.1-kg/m(2) lower, AMA that were 14.8-cm(2) lower, and AFA that were 7.6-cm(2) lower than those seen in the female subjects without TB. Similarly, on average, the male cases of PTB weighed 7.1 kg less and had BMI that were 2.5-kg/m(2) lower, AMA that were 18.8-cm(2) lower and AFA that were 1.6-cm(2) lower than those seen in the male subjects without TB. Although HIV infection was associated with a 1.7-kg lower weight and a 0.6-kg/m(2) lower BMI (with deficits in both AMA and AFA) among males, it was not associated with any such deficits among the female subjects.

Overall, 34.0% of the 374 participants (36.1% of the females and 28.1% of the males) were found seropositive for E. histolytica.

Magnetofection, the process of magnetizing HIV by coupling it to ferrous nanoparticles and coordinating infection using a magnetic field, synchronizes the viral replication cycle at attachment while recapitulating the events of natural infection. Although spinoculation also concentrates virus onto target cells to increase infection, it does not synchronize infection. The synchronization of HIV infection in vitro facilitates the study of events in the viral replication cycle and the antiviral immune response on timelines previously impossible. Furthermore, by infecting a high percentage of cells in a short time frame, magnetofection increases the throughput of in vitro assays.

Patients received a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 cycles with 1 cycle beyond stable radiographic and FDG-PET scans. Overall, 79% of patients received 3 cycles. Combination antiretroviral therapy was suspended before and resumed after therapy. Thirty-three enrolled patients had a median age of 42 years (range, 9-61 years), and 76% had a high-intermediate or high age-adjusted international prognostic index. At 5 years median follow-up, progression-free and overall survival were 84% and 68%, respectively. There were no treatment-related deaths or new opportunistic infections during treatment, and patients had sustained CD4 cell count recovery and HIV viral control after treatment. FDG-PET after 2 cycles had an excellent negative but poor positive predictive value. Tumor histogenesis was the only characteristic associated with lymphoma-specific outcome with 95% of germinal center B-cell (GCB) versus 44% of non-GCB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) progression-free at 5 years. SC-EPOCH-RR is highly effective and less immunosuppressive with shorter duration therapy compared with standard strategies.

20130221,"<e>HIV</e> DNA in circulating monocytes as a mechanism to dementia and other HIV complications.It is broadly accepted that HIV DNA in lymphoid and myeloid cells persists despite combination antiretroviral therapy. Recognized as the Achilles heel to HIV eradication, the role of these peripheral reservoirs in HIV morbidity is less well developed. The burden of HIV DNA in peripheral mononuclear cells is linked to HIV disease outcomes such as time to AIDS diagnosis, survival, and CD4 T-lymphocyte counts. Monocytes are a minor HIV DNA reservoir, and the burden of HIV DNA in these cells appears to be linked to dementia, suggesting that residual infection in this subset is linked to tissue-related HIV complications. Since monocytes are likely involved in trafficking virus to the brain, there is a strong mechanistic link underlying this discovery. Herein, we summarize our current understanding of monocyte HIV DNA and central nervous system dysfunction in humans. We present a model to understand these relationships and suggest possible treatment approaches to be tested.",M2
20126615,"Sequence alignment reveals possible MAPK docking motifs on <e>HIV</e> proteins.Over the course of HIV infection, virus replication is facilitated by the phosphorylation of HIV proteins by human ERK1 and ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). MAPKs are known to phosphorylate their substrates by first binding with them at a docking site. Docking site interactions could be viable drug targets because the sequences guiding them are more specific than phosphorylation consensus sites. In this study we use multiple bioinformatics tools to discover candidate MAPK docking site motifs on HIV proteins known to be phosphorylated by MAPKs, and we discuss the possibility of targeting docking sites with drugs. Using sequence alignments of HIV proteins of different subtypes, we show that MAPK docking patterns previously described for human proteins appear on the HIV matrix, Tat, and Vif proteins in a strain dependent manner, but are absent from HIV Rev and appear on all HIV Nef strains. We revise the regular expressions of previously annotated MAPK docking patterns in order to provide a subtype independent motif that annotates all HIV proteins. One revision is based on a documented human variant of one of the substrate docking motifs, and the other reduces the number of required basic amino acids in the standard docking motifs from two to one. The proposed patterns are shown to be consistent with in silico docking between ERK1 and the HIV matrix protein. The motif usage on HIV proteins is sufficiently different from human proteins in amino acid sequence similarity to allow for HIV specific targeting using small-molecule drugs.",M2
20113183,"Effects of nadir CD4 count and duration of human immunodeficiency virus infection on brain volumes in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era.Cerebral atrophy is a well-described, but poorly understood complication of human immunodeficiency virus (<e>HIV</e>) infection. Despite reduced prevalence of HIV-associated dementia in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, HIV continues to affect the brains of patients with chronic infection. In this study we examine patterns of brain volume loss in HIV-infected patients on HAART, and demographic and clinical factors contributing to brain volume loss. We hypothesized that nadir CD4+ lymphocyte count, duration of HIV infection, and age would be associated with reduced cortical volumes. Volumes of cortical and subcortical regions in 69 HIV-infected neuroasymptomatic (NA) individuals and 13 with at least mild acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex (ADC) were measured using voxel-based morphometry. Demographic and clinical factors (age, plasma HIV RNA level, current and nadir CD4 counts, duration of infection, central nervous system [CNS] penetration of antiretroviral regimen) along with their interactions were entered into a regression model selection algorithm to determine the final models that best described regional brain volumes. Relative to NA, individuals with ADC exhibited decreased total gray matter and parietal cortex volumes and increased total ventricular volumes. Final regression models showed overall cerebral volume, including gray and white matter volume and volumes of the parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes and the hippocampus, were most strongly associated with disease history factors (nadir CD4 and duration of infection). In contrast, basal ganglia volumes were related most strongly to current disease factors, most notably plasma HIV RNA. These findings indicate that individuals with a history of chronic HIV infection with previous episodes of severely impaired immune function, as reflected by reduced nadir CD4+ lymphocyte count, may be at greatest risk for cerebral atrophy. The pattern of HIV-associated brain loss may be changing from a subcortical to a cortical disease among patients who are largely asymptomatic on HAART.",M2

Caucasian survivors were less likely to harbor A68 (P = 0.01), whereas African American survivors less frequently displayed Cw4 (P = .01). However, none of these differences reached statistical significance after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.

20080706,"Aromatic residues at the edge of the antibody combining site facilitate viral glycoprotein recognition through membrane interactions.The broadly neutralizing anti-<e>HIV</e> antibody 4E10 recognizes an epitope very close to the virus membrane on the glycoprotein gp41. It was previously shown that epitope recognition improves in a membrane context and that 4E10 binds directly, albeit weakly, to lipids. Furthermore, a crystal structure of Fab 4E10 complexed to an epitope peptide revealed that the centrally placed, protruding H3 loop of the antibody heavy chain does not form peptide contacts. To investigate the hypothesis that the H3 loop apex might interact with the viral membrane, two Trp residues in this region were substituted separately or in combination with either Ala or Asp by site-directed mutagenesis. The resultant IgG variants exhibited similar affinities for an epitope peptide as WT 4E10 but lower apparent affinities for both viral membrane mimetic liposomes and Env(-) virus. Variants also exhibited lower apparent affinities for Env(+) virions and failed to significantly neutralize a number of 4E10-sensitive viruses. For the extremely sensitive HXB2 virus, variants did neutralize, but at 37- to &gt;250-fold lower titers than WT 4E10, with Asp substitutions exerting a greater effect on neutralization potency than Ala substitutions. Because reductions in lipid binding reflect trends in neutralization potency, we conclude that Trp residues in the antibody H3 loop enable membrane proximal epitope recognition through favorable lipid interactions. The requirement for lipophilic residues such as Trp adjacent to the antigen binding site may explain difficulties in eliciting 4E10-like neutralizing antibody responses by immunization and helps define a unique motif for antibody recognition of membrane proximal antigens.",M2

This electrochemical setup was constructed initially by electrogeneration of poly(11-pyrrol-1-yl-undecanoic acid N(alpha'),N(alpha)-bis(carboxymethyl)-L-lysine amide) (poly(pyrrole-NTA)) film. The latter was then modified by the coordination of Cu(2+) ions onto the chelating NTA centers followed by the immobilization of the ssHIV-DNA previously modified by a polyhistidine tag by affinity binding. The immobilization of the DNA probe and hybridization with the complementary target ssHIV-DNA were investigated using fluorescence microscopy and quantified with quartz crystal microbalance experiments leading to DNA probe and duplex coverage of 1.7 x 10(-11) and 7.7 x 10(-12) mol cm(-2), respectively. The duplex formation was corroborated by amperometric measurements through the duplex labeling by a glucose oxidase. In the presence of hydroquinone as redox indicator, the DNA sensor was applied to the impedimetric detection of target DNA without a labeling step. A linear quantification of the <e>HIV</e> DNA target was carried out in the range 10(-15) to 10(-8) mol L(-1).",M2

20031301,"Neurological complications of miliary tuberculosis.INTRODUCTION: The symptomatic central nervous system involvement is often seen in patients with miliary tuberculosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we evaluated 60 consecutive miliary tuberculosis patients, who presented with some neurological manifestations. Evaluation included neurological examination, a battery of blood tests, <e>HIV</e> serology, sputum examination, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination along with imaging of the brain and spinal cord. The patients were followed up after completion of 6 months of antituberculous treatment. RESULTS: Patients ranged between 14 and 53 years in age. Three patients tested HIV positive. Forty-eight (80%) patients had tuberculous meningitis. In 12 (20%) patients, the CSF examination was normal. In 27 patients with tuberculous meningitis, neuroimaging revealed intracerebral tuberculoma. Fourteen patients showed multiple tuberculomas, while 7 had a solitary tuberculoma. In six patients, the tuberculomas were small and numerous. In two patients, neuroimaging revealed a spinal tuberculoma. For three patients with tuberculous brain masses, the CSF was normal. Nine (15%) patients presented with myelopathy. Three patients exhibited Pott's paraplegia. Three patients had transverse myelitis (with normal neuroimaging). In three patients, the spinal MRI revealed an intramedullary tuberculoma. On follow-up, 15 (25%) patients expired. Thirty-one (52%) patients showed significant improvement. Eight patients (13%) showed nil or partial recovery. Six of the patients with no improvement developed vision loss. Six (10%) patients were lost to follow up. CONCLUSION: A variety of neurological complications were noted in military tuberculosis patients, tuberculous meningitis and cerebral tuberculomas being the most frequent complications. However, a majority of patients improved following antituberculous treatment.",M2

We evaluated the seroprevalence of these viruses in selected individuals from a clinic of infectology, who were referred to the University Regional Hospital of the West Region of state of São Paulo, Brazil. Among a total of 7,021 individuals seen in the clinic following receipt of preliminary ELISA results or having the suggested clinical signs of viral hepatitis or HIV, 1,228 were systematically screened. Isolated or associated HBsAg, HCV and HIV antibodies were found in 44.9% of the subjects. Anti-HIV antibodies were found in 24.7% of the patients, 20.3% of whom had an HIV monoinfection and 4.4% of whom were co-infected with hepatitis viruses (HCV: 4%; HBV: 0.4%). Anti-HCV antibodies were found in 14% of the patients and 5.9% had anti-HBsAg antibodies. HCV infection affected males more than females (p &lt; 0.05) and individuals &gt; 50-years old had an increased prevalence of anti-HCV compared to HIV (p = 0.0001) or HBV (p = 0.0063). HCV-RNA was detected in 73.5% of the samples with a predominance of genotype 1 (72.5%). A significant percentage (44.9%) of the selected individuals was positive for antibodies against HBV, HCV and/or HIV; these patients would otherwise have remained undiagnosed.",M2
20023215,"Rituximab plus concurrent infusional EPOCH chemotherapy is highly effective in <e>HIV</e>-associated B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Rituximab plus intravenous bolus chemotherapy is a standard treatment for immunocompetent patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Some studies have suggested that rituximab is associated with excessive toxicity in HIV-associated NHL, and that infusional chemotherapy may be more effective. We performed a randomized phase 2 trial of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) given either concurrently before each infusional etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (EPOCH) chemotherapy cycle or sequentially (weekly for 6 weeks) after completion of all chemotherapy in HIV-associated NHL. EPOCH consisted of a 96-hour intravenous infusion of etoposide, doxorubicin, and vincristine plus oral prednisone followed by intravenous bolus cyclophosphamide given every 21 days for 4 to 6 cycles. In the concurrent arm, 35 of 48 evaluable patients (73%; 95% confidence interval, 58%-85%) had a complete response. In the sequential arm, 29 of 53 evaluable patients (55%; 95% confidence interval, 41%-68%) had a complete response. The primary efficacy endpoint was met for the concurrent arm only. Toxicity was comparable in the 2 arms, although patients with a baseline CD4 count less than 50/microL had a high infectious death rate in the concurrent arm. We conclude that concurrent rituximab plus infusional EPOCH is an effective regimen for HIV-associated lymphoma.",M2
19997617,"Engineering antigen-specific T cells from genetically modified human hematopoietic stem cells in immunodeficient mice.There is a desperate need for effective therapies to fight chronic viral infections. The immune response is normally fastidious at controlling the majority of viral infections and a therapeutic strategy aimed at reestablishing immune control represents a potentially powerful approach towards treating persistent viral infections. We examined the potential of genetically programming human hematopoietic stem cells to generate mature CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes that express a molecularly cloned,  transgenic  human anti-<e>HIV</e> T cell receptor (TCR). Anti-HIV TCR transduction of human hematopoietic stem cells directed the maturation of a large population of polyfunctional, HIV-specific CD8+ cells capable of recognizing and killing viral antigen-presenting cells. Thus, through this proof-of-concept we propose that genetic engineering of human hematopoietic stem cells will allow the tailoring of effector T cell responses to fight HIV infection or other diseases that are characterized by the loss of immune control.",M2
19927991,"[Accessory proteins of <e>HIV</e> and innate anti-retroviral factors]The HIV genome encodes several accessory proteins (Vif, Vpr, Vpx, Vpu, and Nef) unique to primate lentiviruses, in addition to the structural (Gag, Pol, and Env) and regulatory (Tat and Rev) proteins. Early studies showed that deletion of accessory proteins has a small or no effect on virus replication in cell cultures. However, recent studies have clearly demonstrated that these proteins are essential for efficient viral replication, dissemination, pathogenicity, and disease progression. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of HIV accessory proteins and their cellular targets, and discuss the functional roles of these biologically unique and important viral proteins for virus replication in vitro and in vivo.",M2

Combining the specificity of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope, the cell-penetrating property of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV)-Tat peptide, and the adjuvanticity of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) may elicit strong immune responses and therapeutic effects in HBV infection. We synthesized a fusion peptide containing HBcAg18-27 CTL epitope and HIV-Tat(49-57) peptide. The fusion peptide was intramuscularly injected to HBV transgenic mice with CpG ODN as adjuvant at 2-week intervals three times. The percentages of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells in spleen lymphocytes and the levels of circulating interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-2 were determined for the evaluation of immune responses and the levels of serum HBV DNA and the expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBcAg in liver tissue were determined for the assessment of therapeutic effects. Our results showed that the synthesized fusion peptide adjuvanted with CpG ODN could induce significant increase of the percentages of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells and the levels of IFN-gamma and IL-2, indicating the strong immune responses, and reduced HBV DNA levels and decreased expression of HBsAg and HBcAg in liver tissue, suggesting the therapeutic effects. Collectively, our study supports that HBcAg18-27 CTL epitope fused to HIV-Tat(49-57) peptide adjuvanted with CpG ODN may be a promising strategy for immunotherapy of chronic HBV infection.",M2
19860923,"Comparative functional analysis of Jembrana disease virus Tat protein on lentivirus long terminal repeat promoters: evidence for flexibility at its N-terminus.BACKGROUND: Jembrana disease virus (JDV) encodes a potent regulatory protein Tat that strongly stimulates viral expression by transactivating the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. JDV Tat (jTat) promotes the transcription from its own LTR as well as non-cognate LTRs, by recruiting host transcription factors and facilitating transcriptional elongation. Here, we compared the sequence requirements of jTat for transactivation of JDV, bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (<e>HIV</e>) LTRs. RESULTS: In this study, we identified the minimal protein sequence for LTR activation using jTat truncation mutants. We found that jTat N-terminal residues were indispensable for transactivating the HIV LTR. In contrast, transactivation of BIV and JDV LTRs depended largely on an arginine-rich motif and some flanking residues. Competitive inhibition assay and knockdown analysis showed that P-TEFb was required for jTat-mediated LTR transactivation, and a mammalian two-hybrid assay revealed the robust interaction of jTat with cyclin T1. In addition, HIV LTR transactivation was largely affected by fusion protein at the jTat N-terminus despite the fact that the cyclin T1-binding affinity was not altered. Furthermore, the jTat N-terminal sequence enabled HIV Tat to transactivate BIV and JDV LTRs, suggesting the flexibility at the jTat N-terminus. CONCLUSION: This study showed the distinct sequence requirements of jTat for HIV, BIV and JDV LTR activation. Residues responsible for interaction with cyclin T1 and transactivation response element are the key determinants for transactivation of its cognate LTR. N-terminal residues in jTat may compensate for transactivation of the HIV LTR, based on the flexibility.",M2
19860707,"RNA interference-based gene expression strategies aimed at sustained therapeutic inhibition of <e>HIV</e>.The naturally-occurring RNA interference (RNAi) pathway represents a powerful tool for the sequence-specific post-transcriptional silencing of gene expression. By exploiting the endogenous mammalian RNAi pathway, several expression-based strategies have been developed to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gene expression and replication. This approach potentially has utility as a protective 'therapeutic vaccine' of virus-susceptible lymphocytes. In this review we discuss new developments aimed at improving efficacy and delivery of novel RNAi-based gene expression antiviral strategies. Particular attention is given to advances in combinatorial gene expression systems that prevent the emergence of RNAi-resistant virus by simultaneously targeting multiple HIV targets. Potential usefulness of silencing host factors that are required for viral replication is also discussed. These approaches form the basis for a number of promising ongoing and future clinical trials aimed at providing an effective, safe and prolonged single-intervention therapy for HIV/AIDS.",M2
19859066,"Monkeying around with <e>HIV</e> vaccines: using rhesus macaques to define 'gatekeepers' for clinical trials.Rhesus macaques are an important animal model for the study of human disease and the development of vaccines against HIV and AIDS. HIV vaccines have been benchmarked in rhesus macaque preclinical challenge studies using chimeric viruses made up of parts of HIV and simian immunodeficiency viruses. However, the lack of efficacy in a recent clinical trial calls for a re-evaluation of the scientific assumptions regarding the predictive value of using data generated from rhesus macaques as a 'gatekeeper' for the advancement of candidate vaccines into the clinic. In this context, there is significant consensus among HIV vaccinologists that next-generation HIV vaccines must generate 'better' immunity in rhesus macaques than clinically unsuccessful vaccines generated using validated assays. Defining better immunity is the core challenge of HIV vaccine development in this system and is the focus of this Review.",M2

So far, HIV Env-derived immunogens have not been able to elicit broad neutralizing antibody responses against primary isolates. Identifying conditions that will permit the efficient production of different soluble HIV Env proteins will facilitate a high throughput comparative analysis of the immunogenicity of diverse Env constructs, potentially identifying Env forms that are more conducive to the elicitation of anti-HIV NAbs. Here we compared different cell types, transfection reagents, transfection conditions and different DNA expression vectors on soluble HIV Envelope expression levels. We identified optimal expression conditions and developed a protocol to streamline and maximize production of diverse HIV Env constructs. Using this optimized platform, milligram quantities of purified soluble HIV Env trimer can be routinely achieved in a rapid and cost-effective manner.",M2
19849995,"Induction of mucosal and systemic antibody responses against the <e>HIV</e> coreceptor CCR5 upon intramuscular immunization and aerosol delivery of a virus-like particle based vaccine.Virus-like particles (VLPs) can be exploited as platforms to increase the immunogenicity of poorly immunogenic antigens, including self-proteins. We have developed VLP-based vaccines that target two domains of the HIV coreceptor CCR5 that are involved in HIV binding. These vaccines induce anti-CCR5 antibodies that bind to native CCR5 and inhibit SIV infection in vitro. Given the role of mucosal surfaces in HIV transmission and replication, we also asked whether an aerosolized, VLP-based pulmonary vaccine targeting CCR5 could induce a robust mucosal response in addition to a systemic response. In rats, both intramuscular and pulmonary immunization induced high-titer IgG and IgA against the vaccine in the serum, but only aerosol vaccination induced IgA antibodies at local mucosal sites. An intramuscular prime followed by an aerosol boost resulted in strong serum and mucosal antibody responses. These results show that VLP-based vaccines targeting CCR5 induce high-titer systemic antibodies, and can elicit both local and systemic mucosal response when administered via an aerosol. Vaccination against a self-molecule that is critically involved during HIV transmission and pathogenesis is an alternative to targeting the virus itself. More generally, our results provide a general method for inducing broad systemic and mucosal antibody responses using VLP-based immunogens.",M2
19839582,"An antibody-recruiting small molecule that targets <e>HIV</e> gp120.HIV/AIDS is a global pandemic for which new treatment strategies are desperately needed. We have designed a novel small molecule, designated as ARM-H, that has the potential to interfere with HIV survival through two mechanisms: (1) by recruiting antibodies to gp120-expressing virus particles and infected human cells, thus enhancing their uptake and destruction by the human immune system, and (2) by binding the viral glycoprotein gp120, inhibiting its interaction with the human protein CD4 and preventing virus entry. Here we demonstrate that ARM-H is capable of simultaneously binding gp120, a component of the Env surface viral glycoprotein (found on the surface of both HIV and virus-infected cells) and anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl antibodies (already present in the human bloodstream). The ternary complex formed between the antibody, ARM-H, and gp120 is immunologically active and leads to the complement-mediated destruction of Env-expressing cells. Furthermore, ARM-H prevents virus entry into human T-cells and should therefore be capable of inhibiting virus replication through two mutually reinforcing mechanisms (inhibition of virus entry and antibody-mediated killing). These studies demonstrate the viable anti-HIV activity of antibody-recruiting small molecules and have the potential to initiate novel paradigms in HIV treatment.",M2
19830741,"<e>HIV</e> gag protein is efficiently cross-presented when targeted with an antibody towards the DEC-205 receptor in Flt3 ligand-mobilized murine DC.DC present exogenous proteins to MHC class I-restricted CD8+ T cells. This function does not require endogenous antigen synthesis within DC, providing the potential to elicit CD8+ T-cell responses to immune complexes, inactivated microbes, dying cells, and proteins such as OVA. In mice, the CD8+ or DEC-205+ DC are specialized for cross-presentation, and this subset can be increased 10-fold in numbers following Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) treatment in vivo. Therefore, we studied cross-presentation by abundant Flt3L DC using HIV gag protein. When enriched by positive selection with anti-CD11c beads, cells from Flt3L mice are not only more abundant but are also more highly enriched in CD11chigh DC, particularly the DEC-205+ subset. DC cross-present HIV gag to primed CD8+ T cells, but when the antigen is delivered within an antibody to DEC-205 receptor, cross-presentation becomes 100-fold more efficient than non-targeted antigen. This finding requires gag to be engineered into anti-DEC antibody, not just mixed with antibody. Flt3L DC are a valuable tool to study cross-presentation, since their use overcomes the obstacle posed by the low number of cross-presenting DC in the steady state. These findings support future experiments to use Flt3L to enhance presentation of DC-targeted vaccines.",M2

19762060,"Select resistance-associated mutations in blood are associated with lower CSF viral loads and better neuropsychological performance.BACKGROUND: When antiretroviral therapy does not fully suppress <e>HIV</e> replication, suboptimal levels of antiretrovirals can select for antiretroviral resistant variants of HIV. These variants may exhibit reduced replication capacity and result in lower viral loads in blood. Our study evaluated whether antiretroviral resistance was associated with viral loads in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and better neuropsychological (NP) performance. METHODS: We enrolled 94 participants and each participant underwent a comprehensive neuromedical evaluation that used structured clinical assessments of medical history, ART and other medication use, comprehensive NP testing, and neurological and general physical signs of disease. Blood was collected by venipuncture, and all participants were offered lumbar puncture. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods were used to analyze the relationship between antiretroviral resistance, blood and CSF HIV RNA levels, substance use, and NP performance. RESULTS: Antiretroviral resistance, detected in blood, was associated with lower CSF viral loads (p&lt;0.01) and better NP performance (p=0.04) in multivariate analyses, independent of past and current ARV use and blood viral loads (model: p&lt;0.01). However, HIV RNA levels in CSF did not independently correlate with NP performance. Low viral loads in the CSF limited our ability to investigate the relationship between antiretroviral resistance detected in CSF and NP performance. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the absence of ART, antiretroviral resistance-associated mutations correlate with better NP performance possibly because these mutations reflect reduced neurovirulence compared with wild-type HIV.",M2
19750561,"Maturation of the <e>HIV</e> reverse transcription complex: putting the jigsaw together.Upon HIV attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell cytoplasm, the viral core undergoes rearrangement to become the mature reverse transcription complex (RTC). Reduced infectivity of viral deletion mutants of the core proteins, capsid and negative factor (Nef), can be complemented by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyping suggesting a role for these viral proteins in a common event immediately post-entry. This event may be necessary for correct trafficking of the early complex. Enzymatic activation of the complex occurs either before or during RTC maturation, and may be dependent on the presence of deoxynucleotides in the host cell. The RTC initially becomes enlarged immediately after entry, which is followed by a decrease in its sedimentation rate consistent with core uncoating. Several HIV proteins associated with the RTC and recently identified host-cell proteins are important for reverse transcription while genome-wide siRNA knockdown studies have identified additional host cell factors that may be required for reverse transcription. Determining precisely how these proteins assist the RTC function needs to be addressed.",M2
19749365,"An isostructural G-G to A-A substitution within the <e>HIV</e> RRE RNA switches the specificity towards arginine-rich peptides.The HIV Rev protein utilizes a short alpha-helical arginine-rich RNA-binding domain to bind deeply within the major groove of an internal loop region of the Rev-response element (RRE) RNA. A G48-G71 base-pair which covaries to an isostructural A48-A71 base pair has been shown to play an important structure role in Rev-RRE binding. On the other hand, a high affinity RRE-binding peptide aptamer, the K1 peptide, was shown to have low binding affinity towards the RRE A48-A71 mutant, suggesting that the K1 peptide was recognizing the G48-G71 base-pair. In this study, in an attempt to understand the basis for the recognition of the G48-G71 base-pair by the K1 peptide, the selection of peptides that bind to the RRE A48A71 (RREAA) mutant was carried out. As a result, a peptide specific for the mutant, the LDN1 peptide, was identified. The LDN1 peptide was found to bind to the internal loop region of the RREAA, as in the case of the K1-RRE interaction. However, amino acids important for LDN1-binding to RREAA, were found to be distinct from those important for K1-binding to the RRE. These results demonstrate how subtle changes in RNA structure can dramatically alter the peptide-binding specificity of an RNA.",M2

Basing on parallel CT, GT and antiparallel GT triplex-forming 16-mer oligonucleotides targeted to polypurine tract of HIV proviral DNA, we synthesized eleven different oligonucleotides with 2-4 TINA insertions in different positions. Studies of their interaction with target duplex by gel shift, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism and thermal denaturation demonstrated that antiparallel GT oligonucleotides form more stable triplexes than parallel TC or TG ones. Two best candidates were selected for the further studies.

In addition, astrocyte infection frequency correlated with the severity of neuropathological changes and proximity to perivascular macrophages. Our data indicate that astrocytes can be extensively infected with HIV, and suggest an important role for HIV-infected astrocytes in HIV neuropathogenesis.",M2
19705036,"<e>HIV</e>-envelope-dependent cell-cell fusion: quantitative studies.Interaction in vitro between cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and surrounding, uninfected, target cells often leads to cell fusion and the formation of multinucleated cells, called syncytia. The presence in HIV-infected individuals of virus strains able to induce syncytia in cultures of T cells is associated with disease progression and AIDS. Even in the asymptomatic stage of infection, multinucleated cells have been observed in different organs, indicating that fused cells may be generated and remain viable in the tissues of patients. We used lymphocytic cells transfected for the expression of the HIV-envelope (Env) glycoproteins to develop a method for the direct quantification of fusion events by flow cytometry (Huerta et al., 2006, J. Virol. Methods 138, 17-23; López-Balderas et al., 2007, Virus Res. 123, 138-146). The method involves the staining of fusion partners with lipophilic probes and the use of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to distinguish between fused and aggregated cells. We have shown that such a flow-cytometry assay is appropriate for the screening of compounds that have the potential to modulate HIV-Env-mediated cell fusion. Even those syncytia that are small or few in numbers can be detected. Quantitative analysis of the fusion products was performed with this technique; the results indicated that the time of reaction and initial proportion of fusion partners determine the number, relative size, and average cellular composition of syncytia. Heterogeneity of syncytia generated by HIV-Env-mediated cell-cell fusion may result in a variety of possible outcomes that, in turn, may influence the biological properties of the syncytia and surrounding cells, as well as replication of virus. Given the myriad immune abnormalities leading to AIDS, the full understanding of the extent, diverse composition, and role of fused cells in the pathogenesis of, and immune response to, HIV infection is an important, pending issue.",M2
19692125,"Zinc finger proteins as templates for metal ion exchange: Substitution effects on the C-finger of <e>HIV</e> nucleocapsid NCp7 using M(chelate) species (M=Pt, Pd, Au).The interactions of monofunctional [MCl(chelate)] compounds (M=Pt(II), Pd(II) or Au(III) and chelate=diethylenetriamine, dien or 2,2',2''-terpyridine, terpy) with the C-terminal finger of the HIV nucleocapsid NCp7 zinc finger (ZF) were studied by mass spectrometry and circular dichroism spectroscopy. In the case of [M(dien)] species, Pt(II) and Pd(II) behaved in a similar fashion with evidence of adducts caused by displacement of Pt-Cl or Pd-Cl by zinc-bound thiolate. Labilization, presumably under the influence of the strong trans influence of thiolate, resulted in loss of ligand (dien) as well as zinc ejection and formation of species with only Pd(II) or Pt(II) bound to the finger. For both Au(III) compounds the reactions were very fast and only  gold fingers  with no ancillary ligands were observed. For all terpyridine compounds ligand scrambling and metal exchange occurred with formation of [Zn(terpy)](2+). The results conform well to those proposed from the study of model Zn compounds such as N,N'-bis(2-mercapto-ethyl)-1,4-diazacycloheptanezinc(II), [Zn(bme-dach)](2). The possible structures of the adducts formed are discussed and, for Pt(II) and Pd(II), the evidence for possible expansion of the zinc coordination sphere from four- to five-coordinate is discussed. This observation reinforces the possibility of change in geometry for zinc in biology, even in common  structural  sites in metalloenzymes. The results further show that the extent and rate of zinc displacement by inorganic compounds can be modulated by the nature (metal, ligands) of the reacting compound.",M2
19654853,"Role of interleukin-18 in the development and pathogenesis of AIDS.Interleukin-18 is a proinflammatory, proapoptotic, and proatherogenic cytokine belonging to the interleukin-1 family of cytokines. The cytokine exerts many unique immunologic and biological effects. It is produced as a biologically inactive and leaderless precursor protein, which must be cleaved into its mature form by caspase-1. The caspase-1 also exists in an inactive precursor in the cytosol and needs proteolytic auto-cleavage, which is catalyzed by the assembly of a multi-protein complex called inflammasome. Inside the circulation, interleukin-18 is bound to its naturally occurring antagonist called interleukin-18 binding protein. The antagonist is induced as a negative feedback to increased interleukin-18 production. It protects body cells and tissues from the potentially destructive and harmful proinflammatory effects of the cytokine. Several researchers have reported that the concentrations and biological activities of the cytokine are increased in the circulation of <e>HIV</e>-infected patients. Unlike interleukin-18, the concentrations of its antagonist, interleukin-18 binding protein, are decreased in these persons. The cytokine may play a major role in the development and pathogenesis of AIDS in HIV-infected persons. Insufficient/lack of interleukin-12 and related cytokines may compromise the ability of interleukin-18 to induce interferon-gamma production from natural killer and T-cells. By inducing production of T-helper 2-type cytokines like interleukin-4, -5, -9, and -13 from basophils and mast cells, interleukin-18 promotes the development and differentiation of CD4+ naive T-cells into T-helper 2-type effector cells, which blunt anti-HIV immunity. The effect may be more pronounced in HIV-infected persons with compromised production of interleukin-12. Interleukin-18 also directly enhances viral replication. Because of its proapoptotic effects, the cytokine decreases survivability and promotes the death of various immune and nonimmune cells. It has also been documented to play a role in the depletion and wasting of subcutaneous fat from the limbs and face. The wasting is a characteristic feature of HIV-associated lipodystrophy. The cytokine is also likely to be involved in the higher incidence of atherosclerotic plaques and systemic insulin resistance in these patients. Finally, increased production of the cytokine in the brain may lead to motor and cognitive dysfunctions, leading to the development of HIV-associated dementia. In conclusion, increased interleukin-18 concentrations in HIV-infected persons are likely to play an important role in the development and progression of the infection toward AIDS and associated clinical conditions. Therefore, its neutralization may represent an appropriate and useful immunotherapeutic strategy in these patients. It may delay AIDS progression and improve the immune status of infected persons. The best way to achieve this goal may be using exogenous interleukin-18 binding protein.",M2
19650904,"Enhancement of the priming efficacy of DNA vaccines encoding dendritic cell-targeted antigens by synergistic toll-like receptor ligands.BACKGROUND: Targeting of protein antigens to dendritic cells (DC) via the DEC205 receptor enhances presentation of antigen-derived peptides on MHC-I and MHC-II molecules and, in the presence of costimulatory signals, antigen-specific immune responses. The immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA vaccination can also be enhanced by fusing the encoded antigen to single chain antibodies directed against DEC205. To further improve this strategy, we evaluated different toll-like receptor ligands (TLR) and CD40 ligands (CD40L) as adjuvants for DNA vaccines encoding a DEC205-single-chain antibody fused to the ovalbumin model antigen or <e>HIV</e>-1 Gag and assessed the priming efficacy of DNA in a DNA prime adenoviral vector boost immunization regimen. RESULTS: Mice were primed with the adjuvanted DEC-205 targeted DNA vaccines and boosted with adenoviral vectors encoding the same antigens. CD8+ T cell responses were determined after the adenoviral booster immunization, to determine how well the different DNA immunization regimens prime for the adenoviral boost. In the absence of adjuvants, targeting of DNA-encoded ovalbumin to DCs suppressed CD8+ T-cell responses after the adenoviral booster immunization. CD8+ T-cell responses to the DEC205 targeted DNA vaccines increased only slightly by adding either the TLR-9 ligand CpG, the TLR-3 ligand Poly I:C, or CD40 ligand expression plasmids. However, the combination of both TLR-ligands led to a strong enhancement of CD8+ T-cell responses compared to a non-targeted DNA vaccine. This finding was confirmed using HIV Gag as antigen. CONCLUSION: Although DNA prime adenoviral vector boost immunizations belong to the strongest inducers of cytotoxic T cell responses in different animal models and humans, the CD8+ T cell responses can be further improved by targeting the DNA encoded antigen to DEC205 in the presence of synergistic TLR ligands CpG and Poly I:C.",M2

19627416,"Postmortem detection of hepatitis B, C, and human immunodeficiency virus genomes in blood samples from drug-related deaths in Denmark*.Blood-borne viral infections are widespread among injecting drug users; however, it is difficult to include these patients in serological surveys. Therefore, we developed a national surveillance program based on postmortem testing of persons whose deaths were drug related. Blood collected at autopsy was tested for anti-HBc, anti-HBs, anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV), or anti-human immunodeficiency virus (<e>HIV</e>) antibodies using commercial kits. Subsets of seropositive samples were screened for viral genomes using sensitive in-house and commercial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was detected in 20% (3/15) of anti-HBc-positive/anti-HBs-negative samples, HCV RNA was found in 64% (16/25) of anti-HCV-positive samples, and HIV RNA was detected in 40% (6/15) of anti-HIV-positive samples. The postmortem and antemortem prevalences of HBV DNA and HCV RNA were similar. Postmortem HIV RNA testing was less sensitive than antemortem testing. Thus, postmortem PCR analysis for HBV and HBC infection is feasible and relevant for demonstrating ongoing infections at death or for transmission analysis during outbreaks.",M2

A 68-year-old woman was hospitalized with generalized weakness in June 2006. Echocardiogram revealed the presence of pericardial effusion and she had the signs of cardiac tamponade. Urgent pericardial drainage relieved her symptoms. Chest computed tomography showed bilateral pleural effusions along with pericardial effusion. Cytologic findings of both effusions were suggestive of malignancies, including malignant lymphoma. Immunocytochemical studies with a panel of antibodies, including CD20 and CD79a, could not provide a definite diagnosis. Flow cytometric analysis of pleural effusion revealed that tumor cells were positive for CD10 and CD19, but negative for CD20, CD23, surface immunoglobulin, and T-cell associated antigens. Clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene was detected by Southern blot analysis. Polymerase chain reaction proved to be negative for HHV-8. The serology test for HIV was negative. After a diagnosis of HHV-8-negative PEL-like lymphoma, she was treated with CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). However, she died of progressive lymphoma 7 months after the diagnosis. PEL-like lymphomas are of B-cell origin. In some cases of PEL-like lymphoma, tumor cells may be negative for representative markers of B-cell phenotype such as CD20 and CD79a.",M2
19616505,"Nuclear magnetic resonance evidence for retention of a lamellar membrane phase with curvature in the presence of large quantities of the <e>HIV</e> fusion peptide.The HIV fusion peptide (HFP) is a biologically relevant model system to understand virus/host cell fusion. (2)H and (31)P NMR spectroscopies were applied to probe the structure and motion of membranes with bound HFP and with a lipid headgroup and cholesterol composition comparable to that of membranes of host cells of HIV. The lamellar phase was retained for a variety of highly fusogenic HFP constructs as well as a non-fusogenic HFP construct and for the influenza virus fusion peptide. The lamellar phase is therefore a reasonable structure for modeling the location of HFP in lipid/cholesterol dispersions. Relative to no HFP, membrane dispersions with HFP had faster (31)P transverse relaxation and faster transverse relaxation of acyl chain (2)H nuclei closest to the lipid headgroups. Relative to no HFP, mechanically aligned membrane samples with HFP had broader (31)P signals with a larger fraction of unoriented membrane. The relaxation and aligned sample data are consistent with bilayer curvature induced by the HFP which may be related to its fusion catalytic function. In some contrast to the subtle effects of HFP on a host-cell-like membrane composition, an isotropic phase was observed in dispersions rich in phosphatidylethanolamine lipids and with bound HFP.",M2
19616029,"Molecular basis of human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance: an update.Antiretroviral therapy has led to a significant decrease in human immunodeficiency virus (<e>HIV</e>)-related mortality. Approved antiretroviral drugs target different steps of the viral life cycle including viral entry (coreceptor antagonists and fusion inhibitors), reverse transcription (nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors of the viral reverse transcriptase), integration (integrase inhibitors) and viral maturation (protease inhibitors). Despite the success of combination therapies, the emergence of drug resistance is still a major factor contributing to therapy failure. Viral resistance is caused by mutations in the HIV genome coding for structural changes in the target proteins that can affect the binding or activity of the antiretroviral drugs. This review provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms involved in the acquisition of resistance to currently used and promising investigational drugs, emphasizing the structural role of drug resistance mutations. The optimization of current antiretroviral drug regimens and the development of new drugs are still challenging issues in HIV chemotherapy.

19602283,"Pathogenic infection of Macaca nemestrina with a CCR5-tropic subtype-C simian-human immunodeficiency virus.BACKGROUND: Although pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) have been used in AIDS research for years, less is known about the early immunopathogenic events in this species, as compared to rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Similarly, the events in early infection are well-characterized for simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV), but less so for chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV), although the latter have been widely used in <e>HIV</e> vaccine studies. Here, we report the consequences of intrarectal infection with a CCR5-tropic clade C SHIV-1157ipd3N4 in pig-tailed macaques. RESULTS: Plasma and cell-associated virus was detectable in peripheral blood and intestinal tissues of all four pig-tailed macaques following intrarectal inoculation with SHIV-1157ipd3N4. We also observed a rapid and irreversible loss of CD4+ T cells at multiple mucosal sites, resulting in a marked decrease of CD4:CD8 T cell ratios 0.5-4 weeks after inoculation. This depletion targeted subsets of CD4+ T cells expressing the CCR5 coreceptor and having a CD28-CD95+ effector memory phenotype, consistent with the R5-tropism of SHIV-1157ipd3N4. All three animals that were studied beyond the acute phase seroconverted as early as week 4, with two developing cross-clade neutralizing antibody responses by week 24. These two animals also demonstrated persistent plasma viremia for &gt;48 weeks. One of these animals developed AIDS, as shown by peripheral blood CD4+ T-cell depletion starting at 20 weeks post inoculation. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that SHIV-1157ipd3N4-induced pathogenesis in pig-tailed macaques followed a similar course as SIV-infected rhesus macaques. Thus, R5 SHIV-C-infection of pig-tailed macaques could provide a useful and relevant model for AIDS vaccine and pathogenesis research.",M2
19601773,"Molecular phenotype of CXCL12beta 3'UTR G801A polymorphism (rs1801157) associated to <e>HIV</e>-1 disease progression.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular phenotype of the AIDS-onset delaying polymorphism in CXCL12beta 3'UTR (rs1801157). METHODS: The 3 UTRs of the CXCL12beta isoform containing the A or G polymorphic variants were cloned downstream of the Luciferase gene under the control of the CXCL12 promoter. The plasmids were transfected in U373 and LC5 cells and the polymorphism phenotype was evaluated in terms of Luciferase activity and mRNA stability. RESULTS: The 3'A genotype compared to 3'G leads to an increased luciferase activity in unstimulated and PMA+Ionomycin treated cells both in astrocytes (p = 0,0002, p = 0,02) and fibroblasts (p = 0,002, p = 0,03). The mRNA containing the 3'A variant have two-fold longer half-life compared to the 3'G variant (p = 6,99E(-7)). CONCLUSIONS: CXCL12beta 3'A polymorphism, previously associated with resistance to AIDS progression and other diseases, leads to increased levels of CXCL12 mRNA, the results presented here demonstrate that this effect is a consequence of an enhanced mRNA stability. Our data contribute to characterize the CXCL12 as a potential pharmacological target in AIDS, autoimmune diseases and cancer.",M2
19591597,"Risk of developing specific AIDS-defining illnesses in patients coinfected with <e>HIV</e> and hepatitis C virus with or without liver cirrhosis.BACKGROUND: There are few data concerning the risk of specific opportunistic diseases in patients with and without hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We evaluated the correlation between the occurrence of different AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) and chronic HCV infection or HCV-related liver cirrhosis in a large Italian cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects. METHODS: Subjects were stratified into 2 groups: patients without HCV coinfection and with persistently normal aminotransferase levels and patients with HCV coinfection. The patients with HCV coinfection were stratified according to the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. The incidences of new ADIs were calculated as the number of events per 1000 person-years of follow-up. The rates in the 2 groups were compared using a Poisson regression model adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: We observed a total of 496 ADIs among 5397 patients with 25,105 person-years of follow-up (50% tested positive for HCV). HCV coinfection was associated with increased risk of developing an ADI (adjusted relative rate [ARR], 2.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.88-3.61), specifically bacterial infection (ARR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.76-5.67), HIV-related disease (ARR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.03-6.97), and mycotic disease (ARR, 3.87; 95% CI, 2.28-6.59) but not non-Hodgkin lymphoma (ARR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.22-3.48). The rate of mycotic infection, bacterial infection, toxoplasmosis, and HIV-related ADI among patients with cirrhosis were significantly higher than that among HIV-monoinfected patients, and the risk was greater than that estimated for HCV antibody-positive patients without cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-related bacterial and mycotic infections are strongly associated with positive HCV serostatus and HCV-related cirrhosis. Clinicians should take into account these data when making decisions on initiation of antiretroviral therapy for HCV-coinfected individuals.",M2
19586414,"Disruption of tight junctions by cellulose sulfate facilitates <e>HIV</e> infection: model of microbicide safety.BACKGROUND: The lack of biomarkers that are predictive of safety is a critical gap in the development of microbicides. The present experiments were designed to evaluate the predictive value of in vitro models of microbicide safety. METHODS: Changes in the epithelial barrier were evaluated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) after exposure of human epithelial cells to candidate microbicides in a dual-chamber system. The significance of observed changes was addressed by challenging cultures with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and measuring the ability of virus to cross the epithelium and infect target T cells cultured in the lower chamber. RESULTS: Exposure to nonoxynol-9 (N-9) or cellulose sulfate (CS), but not 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (also referred to as tenofovir) or PRO2000, resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in TER and a marked increase in HIV infection of T cells cultured in the lower chamber. Moreover, CS triggered nuclear factor kappaB activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increased HIV replication in chronically infected U1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Epithelial barrier disruption and enhanced viral replication may have contributed to the increased risk of HIV acquisition observed in phase 3 trials of N-9 and CS. Expansion of in vitro safety testing to include these models would provide a more stringent preclinical assessment of microbicide safety and may prove to be more predictive of clinical outcomes.",M2

19582753,"Immunisation route-dependent expression of IL-4/IL-13 can modulate <e>HIV</e>-specific CD8(+) CTL avidity.All HIV-1 'systemic vaccine trials' in humans have yielded poor outcomes. Thus, it is important to understand whether the route of delivery influences the quality of protective CTL immunity. Using heterologous poxvirus immunisation we have shown that systemically (i.m./i.m.) immunised CD8(+) T cells generated higher levels of IL-4/IL-13 compared to mucosal delivery and expression also correlated with i.m./i.m. immunised mice eliciting CTL of lower avidity. Studies using IL-4(-/-) and IL-13(-/-) KO mice have shown that the capacity to express IFN-gamma, IL-4 and/or IL-13 by K(d)Gag(197-205)-specific CTL differed between these groups and was inversely correlated with CTL avidity (IL-13(-/-)&gt;IL-4(-/-)&gt;BALB/c), although no significant differences in the magnitude of CTL responses were observed between IL-13(-/-) and wild type mice. When IL-13 was reconstituted in IL-13(-/-) splenocytes in vitro, their ability to bind tetramers also decreased significantly. Our data reveal that total absence of IL-13 can greatly enhance CTL avidity. In contrast, extracellular IL-4 appears to be important in maintaining long-term Th1/Th2 balance in CTL, even though expression of IL-4 by CTL markedly reduced avidity. STAT6(-/-) mice also showed memory CTL of higher avidity. Furthermore, CCL5 expression in K(d)Gag(197-205)-specific CTL was also regulated by IL-4/IL-13.",M2

In this article, we explore the potential of transplastomic plants to produce human immunodeficiency virus (<e>HIV</e>) antigens as potential components of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) vaccine. It is shown that the HIV antigens p24 (the major target of T-cell-mediated immune responses in HIV-positive individuals) and Nef can be expressed to high levels in plastids of tobacco, a non-food crop, and tomato, a food crop with an edible fruit. Optimized p24-Nef fusion gene cassettes trigger antigen protein accumulation to up to approximately 40% of the plant's total protein, demonstrating the great potential of transgenic plastids to produce AIDS vaccine components at low cost and high yield.",M2

In the present report, we describe the discovery of a novel series of potent HIV entry inhibitors in which the indole or azaindole ring of previous inhibitors is replaced by a heterobiaryl group. Several of these analogues exhibited IC(50) values of less than 5 nM in a pseudotyped antiviral assay, and compound 13k was demonstrated to exhibit potency and selectivity similar to those of 1 against a panel of clinical viral isolates. Moreover, current structure-activity relationship studies of these novel biaryl gp120 inhibitors revealed that around the biaryl, a fine crevice might exist in the gp120 binding site. Taken in sum, these data reveal a hitherto unsuspected flexibility in the structure-activity relationships for these inhibitors and suggest new avenues for exploration and gp120 inhibitor design.",M2
19525965,"Effective, low-titer antibody protection against low-dose repeated mucosal SHIV challenge in macaques.Neutralizing antibodies are thought to be crucial for <e>HIV</e> vaccine protection, but studies in animal models suggest that high antibody concentrations are required. This is a major potential hurdle for vaccine design. However, these studies typically apply a large virus inoculum to ensure infection in control animals in single-challenge experiments. In contrast, most human infection via sexual encounter probably involves repeated exposures to much lower doses of virus. Therefore, animal studies may have provided an overestimate of the levels of antibodies required for protection in humans. We investigated whether plasma concentrations of antibody corresponding to relatively modest neutralization titers in vitro could protect macaques from repeated intravaginal exposure to low doses of a simian immunodeficiency virus-HIV chimera (SHIV) that uses the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) co-receptor. An effector function-deficient variant of the neutralizing antibody was also included. The results show that a substantially larger number of challenges is required to infect macaques treated with neutralizing antibody than control antibody-treated macaques, and support the notion that effector function may contribute to antibody protection. Overall, the results imply that lower amounts of antibody than previously considered protective may provide benefit in the context of typical human exposure to HIV-1.",M2

Besides elucidating SAR characteristics, we performed molecular modelling studies on both d4U and ddU in order to probe the first phosphorylation step required for the activation of these two nucleoside analogues. Overall, the application of the phosphoramidate approach turned the inactive ddU to a moderately active anti-HIV agent, while this was not the case with d4U. Enzymatic assays investigating the metabolism of d4U phosphoramidates revealed an efficient cleavage of the phosphoramidate motif to release the d4U monophosphate. Thus, a poor second and/or third phosphorylation step may be the most likely reason for the virtual lack of anti-HIV activity in this case.",M2

19470798,"Design, expression, and characterization of a multivalent, combination <e>HIV</e> microbicide.Many promising microbicide candidates are proteins or peptides, including neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Here, the expression of the HIV-neutralizing mAb b12 in transgenic plants is described. The plant-derived mAb b12 was shown to have gp120 binding activity and HIV-neutralizing activity in vitro. However, it is likely that a protein-based microbicide will need to comprise a combination of two or more products, in order to provide long-lasting and cross-clade protection. Building on the expression of mAb b12 and to address the need for a combinational agent, the expression of a fusion protein of mAb b12 with cyanovirin-N, another protein microbicide, has been explored. This fusion protein molecule is predicted to have four binding sites for HIV gp120 with two different specificities. The fusion protein was assembled and expressed in planta, and functionality was confirmed by gp120 binding and HIV neutralization in vitro. Each moiety of the fusion protein retained its binding ability to gp120. In addition, this fusion protein demonstrated increased anti-HIV potency compared to b12 or CV-N alone. This fusion protein addresses the requirement to combine microbicide products, and the production in plants is a step toward resolving the issues of manufacturing scalability and cost for developing countries.",M2

Among the main etiologies of diarrhea in this group of patients are infectious agents that span the array of viruses, bacteria, protozoa, parasites, and fungal organisms. In many instances, highly active antiretroviral therapy remains the cornerstone of therapy for both AIDS and AIDS-related diarrhea, but other targeted therapies have been developed as new pathogens are identified; however, some infections remain treatment challenges. Once identifiable infections as well as other causes of diarrhea are investigated and excluded, a unique entity known as AIDS enteropathy can be diagnosed. Known as an idiopathic, pathogen-negative diarrhea, this disease has been investigated extensively. Atypical viral pathogens, including HIV itself, as well as inflammatory and immunologic responses are potential leading causes of it. Although AIDS enteropathy can pose a diagnostic challenge so too does the treatment of it. Highly active antiretroviral therapy, nutritional supplementation, electrolyte replacements, targeted therapy for infection if indicated, and medications for symptom control all are key elements in the treatment regimen.

No data are available on the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (<e>HIV</e>) among MWHs in Libya. During a one-year period (January to December 2004) blood samples from 300 (59 females) MWHs employed by a local contractor in Tripoli and 300 blood samples from non-medical waste handlers (NMWHs) who had no direct or indirect contact with medical waste were examined for HBV, HCV and HIV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. HBV was detected in 7 (2.3%) and 1 (0.3%) and HCV in 8 (2.7%) and 0 (0.0%) of MWHs and NMWHs, respectively. Significant differences were observed in the detection rates of HBV (OR: 7.14; P&lt;0.04) and HCV (OR: undefined; P&lt;0.005) in MWHs when compared with NMWHs. HIV was not detected in both groups. Of the MWHs studied, 21% were immunised against HBV and 7% were trained to handle medical waste. In addition, 99.7% wore overalls, 57.7% thick disposable gloves, 55% boots and 17.7% masks while handling medical waste. In conclusion, prevalence rates of HBV and HCV were significantly higher in MWHs than those in NMWHs examined.

Vaginal ring devices are at the forefront of this formulation strategy. METHODS: Non-medicated silicone elastomer vaginal rings were prepared having a range of appropriate dimensions for testing vaginal fit in pig-tailed and Chinese rhesus macaques. Cervicovaginal proinflammatory markers were evaluated. Compression testing was performed to compare the relative flexibility of various macaque and commercial human rings. RESULTS: All rings remained in place during the study period and no tissue irritation or significant induction of cervicovaginal proinflammatory markers or signs of physical discomfort were observed during the 8-week study period. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative evaluation suggests that the 25 x 5-mm ring provided optimal fit in both macaque species. Based on the results presented here, low-consistency silicone elastomers do not cause irritation in macaques and are proposed as suitable materials for the manufacture of microbicide-loaded vaginal rings.",M2
