20572396,"[Analysis of the changes in the cellular populations of the pancreatic pseudocyst in an experiment]The purpose of the research was to study, using the quantitative methods, the cellular populations of neutrophilic granulocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and lymphocytes in the connective tissue of the wall of the pancreatic pseudocyst. Local <e>cold</e> application to the pancreas of albino rat with the help of KCH 3A/B cryosurgical complex was used for the modeling of the pseudocyst. General decrease in the cell content in wall of the pseudocyst was detected together with the changes of predominant cell populations during the study. At days 14-21 of the experiment, the neutrophilic granulocytes were found to dominate, by day 30 the dominating cells were the macrophages, which were substituted by fibroblasts at day 45. The progressive increase of the number of lymphocytes was found throughout the the experiment.",M1
20568385,"Efficacy and tolerability of second- and third-generation antihistamines in the treatment of acquired <e>cold</e> urticaria: a meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Acquired cold urticaria (ACU) is a form of physical urticaria that has been treated with first-generation antihistamines; there is a paucity of data regarding second- and third-generation antihistamines for the treatment of ACU. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of the literature to determine the efficacy of second- and third-generation antihistamines in the treatment of ACU. METHODS: Data were extracted via a MEDLINE search of the literature between 1950 and May 2009. We included double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies comparing the treatment of patients with ACU with second- and third-generation antihistamine medications vs placebo. RESULTS: Overall, 98 patients were identified from 4 included studies. Two trials indicated that second- and third-generation antihistamines significantly eliminated the presence of wheals after treatment vs placebo (odds ratio [OR], 8.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.35 to 18.13). Two trials demonstrated a reduction in wheal area after treatment with a second- or third-generation antihistamine compared with placebo (mean difference, -347.99 mm2; 95% CI, -489.43 to -206.54 mm2). Two trials demonstrated significant elimination of pruritus with second- or third-generation antihistamine treatment vs placebo (OR, 10.44; 95% CI, 4.39 to 24.84). All 4 studies assessed the tolerability of a second- or third-generation antihistamine vs placebo and found an increased rate of adverse events (OR, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.53 to 6.06), although the complaints were mild. CONCLUSIONS: The newer, less-sedating antihistamines seem to be effective in the treatment of ACU in terms of their ability to significantly reduce the presence of wheals and pruritus after cold exposure. These medications are usually well tolerated, with only mild adverse effects.",M1
20527297,"Changes in landing mechanics after <e>cold</e>-water immersion.The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of cold-water immersion on kinematics and kinetics during a drop-landing task. On four separate occasions, 9 men performed drop-landings from a 0.6-m platform to a force platform following 30-min immersion to the hip-joint in thermoneutral water (control; 34 degrees C) and in cold water (20 degrees C) to the ankle (low level), knee (medium level), and hip (high level) joints. Sagittal plane kinematics and kinetics were determined. One-way repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. Compared to the control, the low-level condition had similar joint mechanics, the medium level showed 26% less ankle mechanical work (p = .003), and the high level showed 9% less vertical ground reaction force (p = .025) and 23% less ankle mechanical work (p = .023) with 18% greater trunk flexion (p = .024). In summary, the low-level cold-water immersion had no effect on landing mechanics. The medium- and high-level cold-water immersion resulted in a reduction in impact absorption at the ankle joint during landing. The increased trunk flexion after high-level immersion helped dissipate landing impact.",M1
20524441,"A randomized controlled trial for perioperative morbidity in microdebrider versus <e>cold</e> instrument dissection tonsillectomy.BACKGROUND: Tonsillectomy is a common procedure in children. It could produce moderate to severe post operative pain and morbidity. Preserving tonsillar capsule attached to pharyngeal constrictor muscle by microdebrider technique may reduce pain when compared to conventional cold dissection technique. OBJECTIVE: To compare the postoperative pain, perioperative, and postoperative morbidity between the microdebrider-assisted intracapsular tonsillectomy (MT) and cold instrument dissection tonsillectomy (CT). MATERIAL AND METHOD: Forty children with ages between 3-14 years old in Songklanagarind Hospital with tonsillar hypertrophy were randomly assigned to have MT and CT in each group. Data of perioperative morbidity, time to start taking food, LOS, treatment satisfaction, post operative pain, and amount of analgesia were recorded for 7 days. Post operative complication was also followed-up. RESULTS: There were no statistical significantly differences between groups in operation time, time to start taking food, LOS, and amount of postoperative analgesia and treatment satisfaction score. The MT had significantly more blood loss during operation (54.3 +/- 35.45 mL) than the CT (14.78 +/- 18.71 mL) (p &lt; 0.001). The MT had significantly less post operative pain score on postoperative day 2 (2.50 +/- 1.15 and 1.05 +/- 0.83) and 3 (1.70 +/- 0.80 and 1.05 +/- 0.76) (p &lt; 0.05) but no difference on day 0, 1, 4, 5, 6. Pain score after analgesia was significantly better in the MT on day 0 (2.45 +/- 0.94 and 3.40 +/- 1.47) (p = 0.024) but no difference on day 1-6. There were no significant differences in fentanyl use for break through pain, immediate and delayed complications between the groups. CONCLUSION: MT is an effective alternative procedure for children with tonsillar hypertrophy and results in improved postoperative pain but have more intraoperative blood loss.",M1
20526617,"Identification and fine mapping of a major quantitative trait locus originating from wild rice, controlling <e>cold</e> tolerance at the seedling stage.Cold tolerance at the seedling stage (CTSS) is an important trait affecting stable rice production in temperate climates and areas of high elevation. In this study, 331 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were developed and used along with phenotypic evaluation to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with CTSS from a mapping population of 184 F(2) plants derived from a cold tolerant wild rice, W1943 (Oryza rufipogon), and a sensitive indica cultivar, Guang-lu-ai 4 (GLA4). Three QTLs were detected on chromosomes 3, 10 and 11. A major locus, qCtss11 (QTL for cold tolerance at seedling stage), was located on the long arm of chromosome 11 explaining about 40% of the phenotypic variation. Introduction of the W1943 allele of qCtss11 to the GLA4 genetic background increased CTSS. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic assessment of advanced backcross progenies, qCtss11 was dissected as a single Mendelian factor. A high-resolution genetic map was constructed using 23 markers across the qCtss11 locus. As a result, qCtss11 was fine mapped to a 60-kb candidate region defined by marker AK24 and GP0030 on chromosome 11, in which six genes were annotated. Expression and resequence analyses of the six candidates supported the hypothesis that Os11g0615600 and/or Os11g0615900 are causal gene(s) of the CTSS.",M1
20519530,"Grueneberg ganglion neurons are finely tuned <e>cold</e> sensors.The Grueneberg ganglion is a newly appreciated nasal subsystem with neural connections to the olfactory forebrain, but its functional role has not been well defined. Here, we assess whether Grueneberg ganglion neurons (GGNs) function as thermosensors. By investigating the effect of acute temperature changes on the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration of genetically labeled mouse GGNs (either gender), we demonstrate that GGNs are thermosensory neurons specialized to detect a temperature decline within a given temperature window. Furthermore, GGNs comprise a relatively homogeneous cell population with respect to temperature sensitivity. GGNs do not respond to ligands of the temperature-sensitive TRP channels TRPM8 and TRPA1, suggesting a novel mechanism for temperature sensing. One possibility is a cGMP-mediated mechanism, as GGNs express the receptor guanylyl cyclase GC-G, the cGMP-sensitive phosphodiesterase PDE2 and the cGMP-sensitive channel CNGA3. Surprisingly, Cnga3-null mice show normal cooling-induced Ca(2+) responses although cGMP-dependent Ca(2+) increases are absent in these mice. Rather, the cooling-induced Ca(2+) response of GGNs depends critically on the activity of a tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel whereas the cGMP-dependent Ca(2+) signal does not. These findings establish the Grueneberg ganglion as a sensory organ mediating cold-evoked neural responses, possibly in conjunction with the sensing of other stress- or fear-related chemical social cues.",M1
20518169,"[Frozen shoulder due to <e>cold</e> damp treated with acupuncture and moxibustion on tender points]OBJECTIVE: To search for a better method for frozen shoulder due to cold damp. METHODS: Sixty cases of frozen shoulder were randomly divided into an acupuncture-moxibustion group (32 cases) and an acupuncture group (28 cases). Acupuncture was applied mainly at Jianyu (LI 15), Jianliao (TE 14) and Jianzhen (SI 9) in either group. In acupuncture-moxibustion group, moxibustion on tender points was supplemented. RESULTS: In acupuncture-moxibustion group, 7 cases were cured, 15 cases markedly effective, 9 cases improved and 1 case failed. The cured and markedly effective rate was 68.8% and the effective rate was 96.9%. In acupuncture group, 2 cases were cured, 9 cases markedly effective, 13 cases improved and 4 cases failed. The cured and markedly effective rate was 39.3% and the effective rate was 85.7%. The cured and markedly effective rate in acupuncture-moxibustion group was superior to that in acupuncture group (P &lt; 0.05) and there was no significant difference in the effective rate statistically between two groups (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy of acupuncture combined with moxibustion on tender points is superior to that of simple acupuncture on frozen shoulder due to cold damp.",M1
20516198,"Break-induced replication requires all essential DNA replication factors except those specific for pre-RC assembly.Break-induced replication (BIR) is an efficient homologous recombination (HR) pathway employed to repair a DNA double-strand break (DSB) when homology is restricted to one end. All three major replicative DNA polymerases are required for BIR, including the otherwise nonessential Pol32 subunit. Here we show that BIR requires the replicative DNA helicase (Cdc45, the GINS, and Mcm2-7 proteins) as well as Cdt1. In contrast, both subunits of origin recognition complex (ORC) and Cdc6, which are required to create a prereplication complex (pre-RC), are dispensable. The Cdc7 kinase, required for both initiation of DNA replication and post-replication repair (PRR), is also required for BIR. Ubiquitination and sumoylation of the DNA processivity clamp PCNA play modest roles; in contrast, PCNA alleles that suppress pol32Delta's <e>cold</e> sensitivity fail to suppress its role in BIR, and are by themselves dominant inhibitors of BIR. These results suggest that origin-independent BIR involves cross-talk between normal DNA replication factors and PRR.",M1
20501441,"Bifidobacterium bifidum improves intestinal integrity in a rat model of necrotizing enterocolitis.Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. Oral administration of probiotics has been suggested as a promising strategy for prevention of NEC. However, little is known about the mechanism(s) of probiotic-mediated protection against NEC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Bifidobacterium bifidum treatment on development of NEC, cytokine regulation, and intestinal integrity in a rat model of NEC. Premature rats were divided into three groups: dam fed (DF), hand fed with formula (NEC), or hand fed with formula supplemented with 5 x 10(6) CFU B. bifidum per day (B. bifidum). All groups were exposed to asphyxia and <e>cold</e> stress to develop NEC. Intestinal injury, mucin and trefoil factor 3 (Tff3) production, cytokine levels, and composition of tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ) proteins were evaluated in the terminal ileum. B. bifidum decreased the incidence of NEC from 57 to 17%. Increased levels of IL-6, mucin-3, and Tff3 in the ileum of NEC rats was normalized in B. bifidum treated rats. Reduced mucin-2 production in the NEC rats was not affected by B. bifidum. Administration of B. bifidum normalized the expression and localization of TJ and AJ proteins in the ileum compared with animals with NEC. In conclusion, administration of B. bifidum protects against NEC in the neonatal rat model. This protective effect is associated with reduction of inflammatory reaction in the ileum, regulation of main components of mucus layer, and improvement of intestinal integrity.",M1
20501041,"Contemporary formulation and distribution practices for <e>cold</e>-filled acid products: Australian industry survey and modeling of published pathogen inactivation data.A survey of 12 Australian manufacturers indicated that mild-tasting acids and preservatives are used to partially replace acetic acid in cold-filled acid dressings and sauces. In contrast to traditional ambient temperature distribution practices, some manufacturers indicated that they supply the food service sector with cold-filled acid products prechilled for incorporation into ready-to-eat foods. The Comité des Industries des Mayonnaises et Sauces Condimentaires de la Communauté Economique Européenne (CIMSCEE) Code, a formulation guideline used by the industry to predict the safety of cold-filled acid formulations with respect to Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli, does not extend to the use of acids and preservatives other than acetic acid nor does it consider the effects of chill distribution. We found insufficient data in the published literature to comprehensively model the response of S. enterica and E. coli to all of the predictor variables (i.e., pH, acetic acid, NaCl, sugars, other acids, preservatives, and storage temperature) of relevance for contemporary cold-filled acid products in Australia. In particular, we noted a lack of inactivation data for S. enterica at aqueous-phase NaCl concentrations of &gt;3% (wt/wt). However, our simple models clearly identified pH and 1/absolute temperature of storage as the most important variables generally determining inactivation. To develop robust models to predict the effect of contemporary formulation and storage variables on product safety, additional empirical data are required. Until such models are available, our results support challenge testing of cold-filled acid products to ascertain their safety, as suggested by the CIMSCEE, but suggest consideration of challenging with both E. coli and S. enterica at incubation temperatures relevant to intended product distribution temperatures.",M1
20496861,"Effects of dietary energy intake and <e>cold</e> exposure on kinetics of plasma phenylalanine, tyrosine and protein synthesis in sheep.An isotope dilution method of [2H5]phenylalanine (Phe) and [2H2]tyrosine (Tyr) was used to determine the effects of metabolisable energy (ME) intake and cold exposure on plasma Phe and Tyr turnover rates in sheep. Whole body protein synthesis (WBPS) was calculated with the [2H5]Phe model. Eight adult sheep were assigned to two dietary treatments receiving the same amount of crude protein and either 515 or 828 kJ x kg BW(-0.75) x d(-1) of ME (Me-ME diet and Hi-ME diet, respectively) with a crossover design for two 28 d periods. The sheep were exposed from a thermoneutral environment (23 +/- 1 degrees C) to a cold environment (2 +/- 1 to 4 +/- 1 degrees C) for 6 d for each dietary treatment. The primed-continuous infusion method of isotope dilution was conducted in both environmental temperatures. Plasma Phe turnover rate (PheTR) tended to be greater and plasma Tyr turnover rate (TyrTR) was greater (p = 0.03) for the Hi-ME diet compared with the Me-ME diet. Plasma PheTR increased (p = 0.04) and plasma TyrTR tended to increase during cold exposure. Whole body protein synthesis tended to be greater for the Hi-ME diet compared with the Me-ME diet and increased (p = 0.03) during cold exposure compared to the thermoneutral environment, but no interaction was detected. It was concluded that in sheep, plasma PheTR and WBPS (as determined by the [2H5]Phe model) tended to be influenced by and plasma TyrTR was influenced by ME intake. Further, plasma PheTR and WBPS increased and plasma TyrTR tended to increase during cold exposure.",M1

20463235,"Functional characterization of alpha9-containing cholinergic nicotinic receptors in the rat adrenal medulla: implication in stress-induced functional plasticity.An increase in circulating adrenal catecholamine levels constitutes one of the mechanisms whereby organisms cope with stress. Accordingly, stimulus-secretion coupling within the stressed adrenal medullary tissue undergoes persistent remodeling. In particular, cholinergic synaptic neurotransmission between splanchnic nerve terminals and chromaffin cells is upregulated in stressed rats. Since synaptic transmission is mainly supported by activation of postsynaptic neuronal acetylcholine nicotinic receptors (nAChRs), we focused our study on the role of alpha9-containing nAChRs, which have been recently described in chromaffin cells. Taking advantage of their specific blockade by the alpha-conotoxin RgIA (alpha-RgIA), we unveil novel functional roles for these receptors in the stimulus-secretion coupling of the medulla. First, we show that in rat acute adrenal slices, alpha9-containing nAChRs codistribute with synaptophysin and significantly contribute to EPSCs. Second, we show that these receptors are involved in the tonic inhibitory control exerted by cholinergic activity on gap junctional coupling between chromaffin cells, as evidenced by an increased Lucifer yellow diffusion within the medulla in alpha-RgIA-treated slices. Third, we unexpectedly found that alpha9-containing nAChRs dominantly (&gt;70%) contribute to acetylcholine-induced current in <e>cold</e>-stressed rats, whereas alpha3 nAChRs are the main contributing channels in unstressed animals. Consistently, expression levels of alpha9 nAChR transcript and protein are overexpressed in cold-stressed rats. As a functional relevance, we propose that upregulation of alpha9-containing nAChR channels and ensuing dominant contribution in cholinergic signaling may be one of the mechanisms whereby adrenal medullary tissue appropriately adapts to increased splanchnic nerve electrical discharges occurring in stressful situations.",M1
20462418,"Self-reported <e>cold</e> sensitivity in normal subjects and in patients with traumatic hand injuries or hand-arm vibration syndrome.BACKGROUND: Cold sensitivity is a common and disabling complaint following hand injuries. The main purpose of this study was to describe self-reported consequences of cold sensitivity and the association with disability and health-related quality of life in patients with hand injuries or hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) and in normal subjects. METHODS: Responses to the Cold Intolerance Symptom Severity (CISS) questionnaire, Potential Work Exposure Scale (PWES), Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Short-Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36) were investigated in normal subjects (n = 94), hand injured patients (amputation and nerve injuries, n = 88) and patients with HAVS (n = 30). The results are presented as median (range), percent and mean deviation from norms. The Kruskal Wallis Test or Mann-Whitney U-Test were used to identify significant differences between multiple groups or subgroups. The Spearman rank correlation was used to study the relationship between cold sensitivity and disability. RESULTS: Abnormal cold sensitivity (CISS score &gt; 50) was seen in 75% and 45% of patients with HAVS and a traumatic hand injury, respectively. Patients were significantly more exposed to cold in their work environment than the normal population, with a consequently negative effect on work ability due to cold sensitivity. Patients with abnormal cold sensitivity were more seriously disabled and had a poorer health-related quality of life than patients with normal cold sensitivity [higher DASH scores and e.g. significantly larger mean deviation from norms in the subscales Role Physical and Bodily Pain (SF-36)]. CONCLUSION: Severe and abnormal cold sensitivity may have a profound impact on work capacity, leisure, disability and health-related quality of life. It is frequently seen in patients with traumatic hand injuries and particularly apparent in patients with HAVS.",M1
20453914,"Comparison of effectiveness of wood decay fungi maintained by annual subculture on agar and stored in sterile water for 18 years.Fourteen isolates of basidiomycete decay fungi (12 species) were maintained for 18 years on agar slants transferred annually and also stored as mycelium-agar cores under <e>cold</e> sterile water without subculture. Isolates stored by each method were evaluated for decay effectiveness using a standard laboratory accelerated soil-block decay test. Effectiveness was measured by mean percent mass loss of wood blocks. There was no significant difference (p &lt; or = 0.05) in decay effectiveness between storage methods for 12 of the fungus isolates tested. For the 2 fungi that showed a significant difference in the amount of decay with respect to storage method, 1 fungus (Fomitopsis lilacinogilva) produced more decay by the strain maintained as an agar slant, while the other fungus (Trametes versicolor) produced more decay by the strain stored in sterile water. Results suggested that storage under sterile water is an easy and effective method to store isolates of decay fungi for long periods, but as with any microbial storage method, careful monitoring of isolates upon revival is necessary.",M1

Given the breadth of their potential application, simple methods that increase ZFN activity, thus ensuring genome modification, are highly attractive. Here we show that transient hypothermia generally and robustly increased the level of stable, ZFN-induced gene disruption, thereby providing a simple technique to enhance the experimental efficacy of ZFNs.",M1
20436470,"Substitutions in woolly mammoth hemoglobin confer biochemical properties adaptive for <e>cold</e> tolerance.We have genetically retrieved, resurrected and performed detailed structure-function analyses on authentic woolly mammoth hemoglobin to reveal for the first time both the evolutionary origins and the structural underpinnings of a key adaptive physiochemical trait in an extinct species. Hemoglobin binds and carries O(2); however, its ability to offload O(2) to respiring cells is hampered at low temperatures, as heme deoxygenation is inherently endothermic (that is, hemoglobin-O(2) affinity increases as temperature decreases). We identify amino acid substitutions with large phenotypic effect on the chimeric beta/delta-globin subunit of mammoth hemoglobin that provide a unique solution to this problem and thereby minimize energetically costly heat loss. This biochemical specialization may have been involved in the exploitation of high-latitude environments by this African-derived elephantid lineage during the Pleistocene period. This powerful new approach to directly analyze the genetic and structural basis of physiological adaptations in an extinct species adds an important new dimension to the study of natural selection.",M1
20427717,"The molecular basis of aerobic metabolic remodeling differs between oxidative muscle and liver of threespine sticklebacks in response to <e>cold</e> acclimation.We sought to determine the molecular basis of elevations in aerobic metabolic capacity in the oxidative muscle and liver of Gasterosteus aculeatus in response to cold acclimation. Fishes were cold- or warm-acclimated for 9 wk and harvested on days 1, 2, and 3 and weeks 1, 4, and 9 of cold acclimation at 8 degrees C, and on day 1 and week 9 of warm acclimation at 20 degrees C. Mitochondrial volume density was quantified using transmission electron microscopy and stereological techniques in warm- and cold-acclimated fishes harvested after 9 wk at 20 or 8 degrees C. Changes in aerobic metabolic capacity were assessed by measuring the maximal activity of citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) in fishes harvested throughout the acclimation period. Transcript levels of the aerobic metabolic genes CS, COXIII, and COXIV, and known regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivators-1alpha and -1beta (PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta), nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), and mitochondrial transcription factor-A were measured in fishes harvested throughout the acclimation period using quantitative real-time PCR. The maximal activities of CS and COX increased in response to cold acclimation in both tissues, but mitochondrial volume density only increased in oxidative muscle (P &lt; 0.05). The time course for changes in aerobic metabolic capacity differed between liver and muscle. The expression of CS increased within 1 wk of cold acclimation in liver and was correlated with an increase in mRNA levels of NRF-1 and PGC-1beta. Transcript levels of aerobic metabolic genes increased later in oxidative muscle, between weeks 4 and 9 of cold acclimation and were correlated with an increase in mRNA levels of NRF-1 and PGC-1alpha. These results show that aerobic metabolic remodeling differs between liver and muscle in response to cold acclimation and may be triggered by different stimuli.",M1
20417398,"Synthesis of cyclopropane fatty acids in Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and their cellular fatty acids changes following short term acid and <e>cold</e> stresses.An implemented GC method to separate and quantify the cell cyclopropane fatty acids lactobacillic (C19cyc11) and dehydrosterculic (C19cyc9) was used to study the adaptive response to sublethal acid and cold stresses in Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. The comparison of the composition of cellular fatty acids of the two strains and their changes after 2 h of stress exposure under micro-aerobic and anaerobic conditions indicated that the aerobic biosynthetic pathway for unsaturated fatty acids is prevalent in L. sanfranciscensis, while the anaerobic pathway is prevalent in L. helveticus. Indeed in the latter strain, in the presence of a source of oleic acid and under micro-aerobic conditions, C18:1n11 and its post-synthetic derivative C19cyc11 accounted for overall proportion ranging from 52 to 28% of the total FAs. On the other hand L. sanfranciscensis synthesizes by aerobic pathway C18:1n9 and transforms it to C19cyc9. However in this species the cumulative level of these two FAs did not exceed 30%. The relevant proportion of dodecanoic acid in the latter species suggests that carbon chain shortening is the principal strategy of L. sanfranciscensis to modulate fluidity or chemico-physical properties of the membranes.",M1
20410663,"Profiling of mitochondrial transcriptome in germinating wheat embryos and seedlings subjected to <e>cold</e>, salinity and osmotic stresses.Mitochondrial functions are potential targets of abiotic stresses that are major environmental factors limiting plant development and productivity. To evaluate mitochondrial responses to abiotic stresses we studied mitochondrial transcriptome profiles at the early stages of wheat development after imbibition under normal and induced stress conditions. Three stresses given were low temperature (4 degrees C), high salinity (0.2 M NaCl) and high osmotic potential (0.3 M mannitol). All these stresses greatly reduced growth but dramatically increased respiration both via the cytochrome and alternative pathways. Macroarray analysis of the mitochondrial transcriptome revealed that most of the changes in transcript levels were stress specific but groups of genes responded commonly to different stresses. Under 3-days continuous stresses, 13 genes showed low temperature specific responses with either up- or down-regulation, while 14 and 23 genes showed responses specific to high salinity and high osmotic potential, respectively. On the other hand, 13 genes showed common responses, among which cob and ccmFn increased their transcript levels while transcripts of the other genes including nad6, atp4 and atp9 decreased. The differential profiles of mitochondrial transcriptome revealed by the macroarray analysis were verified by the quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis. Taken together, three among five nuclear-encoded mitochondria-targeted genes included in the array showed decreases under the stresses, while MnSOD and AOX increased their transcript amounts. Our results indicated the existence of common and different regulatory mechanisms that can sense different abiotic stresses and modulate both nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression in germinating wheat embryos and seedlings.",M1
20410479,"Inhibition of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis by neurons in the ventrolateral medulla and in the nucleus tractus solitarius.Neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) and in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) play important roles in the regulation of cardiovascular and other autonomic functions. In the present study, we demonstrate an inhibition of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis evoked by activation of neurons in the VLM, as well as by neurons in the intermediate NTS, of chloralose/urethane-anesthetized, artificially ventilated rats. Activation of neurons in either rostral VLM or caudal VLM with N-methyl-d-aspartate (12 nmol) reversed the <e>cold</e>-evoked increase in BAT sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), BAT temperature, and end-expired CO(2). Disinhibition of neurons in either VLM or NTS with the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline (30 pmol), reversed the increases in BAT SNA, BAT temperature, and end-expired CO(2) that were elicited 1) by cold defense; 2) during the febrile model of nanoinjection of prostaglandin E(2) into the medial preoptic area; 3) by activation of neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus or in the rostral raphe pallidus (rRPa); or 4) by the micro-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl. Combined, but not separate, inhibitions of neurons in the VLM and in the NTS, with the GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol (120 pmol/site), produced increases in BAT SNA, BAT temperature, and expired CO(2), which were reversed by nanoinjection of glycine (30 nmol) into the rRPa. These findings suggest that VLM and NTS contain neurons whose activation inhibits BAT thermogenesis, that these neurons receive GABAergic inputs that are active under these experimental conditions, and that neurons in both sites contribute to the tonic inhibition of sympathetic premotor neuronal activity in the rRPa that maintains a low level of BAT thermogenesis in normothermic conditions.",M1

20393269,"Acute pressure block of the sciatic nerve relieves clinical pain but not <e>cold</e> pressor pain.OBJECTIVES: Acute pressure applied to the sciatic nerve has been recently reported to offer immediate short-term pain relief in patients with various diseases. This study examined the analgesic effect of this novel method on cold pressor pain compared with clinical pain. METHODS: We conducted 2 randomized, parallel, group studies. The cold pressor study involved 152 undergraduate students and the clinical study included 22 cancer patients. Acute pressure of 11 to 20 kg was simultaneously applied to the sciatic nerves at the back of both thighs for 2 minutes. The placebo intervention was pressure applied to parallel regions on the fronts of the thighs. Next, patients rated pain attributable to their diseases and the students evaluated pain after their hands were submerged in cold water. RESULTS: Acute pressure applied to the sciatic nerve produced immediate clinical pain relief, but did not alleviate cold pressor pain. DISCUSSION: Our study indicated that cold pressor pain and clinical pain responded differently to acute pressure blockade of the sciatic nerve. Our findings indicate that caution should be exercised when attempting to extrapolate cold pressor pain findings to clinical pain.",M1
20388280,"Impact of host tree on forest tent caterpillar performance and offspring overwintering mortality.One of the most damaging insect pests in deciduous forests of North America is the forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria Hübner. It can feed on a variety of plants, but trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux) is its preferred host and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall) serves as a secondary one in the northern part of its distribution. Because host plant characteristics influence insect performance and survival, we evaluated the impact of trembling aspen and sugar maple foliage on M. disstria performance. Host effects on insect <e>cold</e> hardiness and overwintering survival of offspring were also studied. Forest tent caterpillar reared on aspen leaves had a shorter development time, higher pupal weights and fecundity, and superior egg parameters (length and weight) compared with those reared on sugar maple leaves. Larvae from the two food treatments had low glucose levels during diapause, whereas glycerol content of insects reared on maple was significantly higher during diapause than larvae fed on aspen. Lower glycerol content may explain the higher overwinter mortality of pharate larvae from aspen-reared parents even though their supercooling points were as low as -36 degrees C. This study shows the influence of host plant on insect life history and the need to consider overwintering success and offspring performance in studies to understand and predict population growth and cycling.",M1

20387039,"Gene regulation during <e>cold</e> stress acclimation in plants.Cold stress adversely affects plant growth and development and thus limits crop productivity. Diverse plant species tolerate cold stress to a varying degree, which depends on reprogramming gene expression to modify their physiology, metabolism, and growth. Cold signal in plants is transmitted to activate CBF-dependent (C-repeat/drought-responsive element binding factor-dependent) and CBF-independent transcriptional pathway, of which CBF-dependent pathway activates CBF regulon. CBF transcription factor genes are induced by the constitutively expressed ICE1 (inducer of CBF expression 1) by binding to the CBF promoter. ICE1-CBF cold response pathway is conserved in diverse plant species. Transgenic analysis in different plant species revealed that cold tolerance can be significantly enhanced by genetic engineering CBF pathway. Posttranscriptional regulation at pre-mRNA processing and export from nucleus plays a role in cold acclimation. Small noncoding RNAs, namely micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are emerging as key players of posttranscriptional gene silencing. Cold stress-regulated miRNAs have been identified in Arabidopsis and rice. In this chapter, recent advances on cold stress signaling and tolerance are highlighted.",M1
20385973,"Ribonucleic acid interference knockdown of interleukin 6 attenuates <e>cold</e>-induced hypertension.The purpose of this study was to determine the role of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 in cold-induced hypertension. Four groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were used (6 rats per group). After blood pressure was stabilized, 3 groups received intravenous delivery of adenoassociated virus carrying IL-6 small hairpin RNA (shRNA), adenoassociated virus carrying scrambled shRNA, and PBS, respectively, before exposure to a cold environment (5 degrees C). The last group received PBS and was kept at room temperature (25 degrees C, warm) as a control. Adenoassociated virus delivery of IL-6 shRNA significantly attenuated cold-induced elevation of systolic blood pressure and kept it at the control level for &lt; or =7 weeks (length of the study). Chronic exposure to cold upregulated IL-6 expression in aorta, heart, and kidneys and increased macrophage and T-cell infiltration in kidneys, suggesting that cold exposure increases inflammation. IL-6 shRNA delivery abolished the cold-induced upregulation of IL-6, indicating effective silence of IL-6. Interestingly, RNA interference knockdown of IL-6 prevented cold-induced inflammation, as evidenced by a complete inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression and leukocyte infiltration by IL-6 shRNA. RNA interference knockdown of IL-6 significantly decreased the cold-induced increase in vascular superoxide production. It is noted that IL-6 shRNA abolished the cold-induced increase in collagen deposition in the heart, suggesting that inflammation is involved in cold-induced cardiac remodeling. Cold exposure caused glomerular collapses, which could be prevented by knockdown of IL-6, suggesting an important role of inflammation in cold-induced renal damage. In conclusion, cold exposure increased IL-6 expression and inflammation, which play critical roles in the pathogenesis of cold-induced hypertension and cardiac and renal damage.",M1
20385075,"Effectiveness of a  <e>cold</e> dessert , with or without the addition of a mixture of digestive herbs, in subjects with  functional dyspepsia . Functional dyspepsia  represents a clinical condition of pain and/or persistent or recurrent discomfort that concerns a large portion of the healthy population. It has already been shown that some herbs (Melissa Officinalis, Cynara scolymus) can have favorable effects on digestion. The principal aim of this study is to determine whether the ingestion of  Gran Soleil  dessert, with or without herbs, after meals can be beneficial to health in subjects suffering from functional dyspepsia. For this purpose, thirty subjects with functional dyspepsia were enrolled and were asked to consume  Gran Soleil  with or without herbs; these subjects reported the course of their symptoms on VAS scale, during the basal period and after the ingestion  Gran Soleil  with and without herbs. It has been shown that the ingestion of  Gran Soleil  without herbs can induce a reduction both in the number of events connected to a dyspeptic syndrome and in their intensity; moreover the assumption of  Gran Soleil  with the addition of herbs helped to intensify this effect.",M1
20375268,"Effect of aging on cardiac function during <e>cold</e> stress in humans.To determine whether skin surface cooling increases left ventricular preload and contractility to a greater extent in older compared with young adults we studied 11 young (28 +/- 2 yr; means +/- SE) and 11 older (64 +/- 3 yr) adults during normothermia (35 degrees C water perfused through a tube-lined suit) and cooling (15 degrees C water perfused for 20 min) using standard and tissue Doppler echocardiography. Cooling significantly decreased skin surface temperature in young (Delta2.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C) and older (Delta3.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C) adults and increased rate-pressure product, an index of myocardial oxygen demand, in older (6,932 +/- 445 to 7,622 +/- 499 mmHg x beats/min for normothermia and cooling, respectively), but not young (7,085 +/- 438 to 7,297 +/- 438 mmHg x beats/min) adults. Increases in blood pressure (systolic and mean blood pressure) during cooling were greater (P &lt; 0.05) in older than in young adults. Cooling increased preload in older (left ventricular end-diastolic volume from 106 +/- 7 to 126 +/- 9 ml and left ventricular internal diameter in diastole from 4.69 +/- 0.12 to 4.95 +/- 0.14 cm; both P &lt; 0.01), but not young adults (left ventricular end-diastolic volume from 107 +/- 7 to 111 +/- 7 ml and left ventricular internal diameter in diastole from 4.70 +/- 0.10 to 4.78 +/- 0.10 cm). Indices of left ventricular contractility (ejection fraction, myocardial acceleration during isovolumic contraction, and peak systolic mitral annulus velocity) were unchanged during cooling in both young and older adults. Collectively, these data indicate that cooling increases left ventricular preload, without affecting left ventricular contractility in older but not young adults. Greater increases in preload and afterload during cooling in older adults contribute to greater increases in indices of myocardial oxygen demand and may help explain the increased risk of cardiovascular events in cold weather.",M1
20374886,"Evaluation of sodium alginate and glucono-delta-lactone levels on the <e>cold</e>-set gelation of porcine myofibrillar proteins at different salt concentrations.This study investigated the effects of sodium alginate (SA) and glucono-delta-lactone (GdL) levels on the cold-set gelation of porcine myofibrillar protein (MP) at different salt concentrations. The addition of GdL at 0.1M salt concentration had no effects on cold-set MP gelation, and GdL level higher than 1% was necessary at 0.3M salt concentration to form a MP gel. The SA system with 0.5% GdL showed an effect on MP gelation at 0.1M salt, while SA with 1.5% GdL could be form a cold-set MP gel at 0.3M salt level. The endothermic peaks were reduced or completely disappeared by the addition of GdL more than 1%. These results indicated that the SA was favorable in forming a cold-set MP gel under low salt concentrations (&lt;0.1M), and that the SA could be applicable at higher salt concentrations by combining with the GdL level more than 1% (&gt;1%).",M1
20371814,"Spinal processing of noxious and innocuous <e>cold</e> information: differential modulation by the periaqueductal gray.In addition to cold being an important behavioral drive, altered cold sensation frequently accompanies pathological pain states. However, in contrast to peripheral mechanisms, central processing of cold sensory input has received relatively little attention. The present study characterized spinal responses to noxious and innocuous intensities of cold stimulation in vivo and established the extent to which they are modulated by descending control originating from the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a major determinant of acute and chronic pain. In lightly anesthetized rats, hindpaw cooling with ethyl chloride, but not acetone, was sufficiently noxious to evoke withdrawal reflexes, which were powerfully inhibited by ventrolateral (VL)-PAG stimulation. In a second series of experiments, subsets of spinal dorsal horn neurons were found to respond to innocuous and/or noxious cold. Descending control from the VL-PAG distinguished between activity in nociceptive versus non-nociceptive spinal circuits in that innocuous cold information transmitted by non-nociceptive class 1 and wide-dynamic-range class 2 neurons remained unaltered. In contrast, noxious cold information transmitted by class 2 neurons and all cold-evoked activity in nociceptive-specific class 3 neurons was significantly depressed. We therefore demonstrate that spinal responses to cold can be powerfully modulated by descending control systems originating in the PAG, and that this control selectively modulates transmission of noxious versus innocuous information. This has important implications for central processing of cold somatosensation and, given that chronic pain states are dependent on dynamic alterations in descending control, will help elucidate mechanisms underlying aberrant cold sensations that accompany pathological pain states.",M1
20364990,"Growth and melting of droplets in <e>cold</e> vapors.A model has been developed to investigate the growth of droplets in a supersaturated cold vapor taking into account their possible solid-liquid phase transition. It is shown that the solid-liquid phase transition is nontrivially coupled, through the energy released in attachment, to the nucleation process. The model is based on the one developed by J. Feder, K. C. Russell, J. Lothe, and G. M. Pound [Adv. Phys. 15, 111 (1966)], where the nucleation process is described as a thermal diffusion motion in a two-dimensional field of force given by the derivatives of a free-energy surface. The additional dimension accounts for droplets internal energy. The solid-liquid phase transition is introduced through a bimodal internal energy distribution in a Gaussian approximation derived from small clusters physics. The coupling between nucleation and melting results in specific nonequilibrium thermodynamical properties, exemplified in the case of water droplets. Analyzing the free-energy landscapes gives an insight into the nucleation dynamics. This landscape can be complex but generally exhibits two paths: the first one can generally be ascribed to the solid state, while the other to the liquid state. Especially at high supersaturation, the growth in the liquid state is often favored, which is not unexpected since in a supersaturated vapor the droplets can stand higher internal energy than at equilibrium. From a given critical temperature that is noticeably lower than the bulk melting temperature, nucleation may end in very large liquid droplets. These features can be qualitatively generalized to systems other than water.",M1

20354155,"The emergence of <e>cold</e>-induced brown adipocytes in mouse white fat depots is determined predominantly by white to brown adipocyte transdifferentiation.The origin of brown adipocytes arising in white adipose tissue (WAT) after cold acclimatization is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that several UCP1-immunoreactive brown adipocytes occurring in WAT after cold acclimatization have a mixed morphology (paucilocular adipocytes). These cells also had a mixed mitochondrioma with classic  brown  and  white  mitochondria, suggesting intermediate steps in the process of direct transformation of white into brown adipocytes (transdifferentiation). Quantitative electron microscopy disclosed that cold exposure (6 degrees C for 10 days) did not induce an increase in WAT preadipocytes. beta(3)-adrenoceptor-knockout mice had a blunted brown adipocyte occurrence upon cold acclimatization. Administration of the beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist CL316,243 induced the occurrence of brown adipocytes, with the typical morphological features found after cold acclimatization. In contrast, administration of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist xamoterol increased only the number of preadipocytes. These findings indicate that transdifferentiation depends on beta(3)-adrenoceptor activation, whereas preadipocyte recruitment is mediated by beta(1)-adrenoceptor. RT-qPCR experiments disclosed that cold exposure induced enhanced expression of the thermogenic genes and of genes expressed selectively in brown adipose tissue (iBAT) and in both interscapular BAT and WAT. beta(3)-adrenoceptor suppression blunted their expression only in WAT. Furthermore, cold acclimatization induced an increased WAT expression of the gene coding for C/EBPalpha (an antimitotic protein), whereas Ccna1 expression (related to cell proliferation) was unchanged. Overall, our data strongly suggest that the cold-induced emergence of brown adipocytes in WAT predominantly reflects beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated transdifferentiation.",M1
20354064,"Applications of <e>cold</e> temperature stress to age fractionate Caenorhabditis elegans: a simple inexpensive technique.The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans's (CE) successful use in studies of aging is well documented. Cold temperature stress of mixed populations of CE provides a rapid inexpensive means of obtaining three life stage-specific cohorts. Cohorts are obtained in quantities that allow acquisition of replicate metabolite profiles of changes associated with development, aging, and senescence. The fractionation technique is effective with monoxenic and axenic CE cultures. Cohort Y contains 100% young worms, and Cohort A contains 75% adult worms. Cohort M, prereproductive and reproductive, contains some A and Y due to continuous egg laying and hatch. Principal component analysis of normalized data from metabolite profiles obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography electrochemical analysis clearly separates Cohort Y from Cohort A and monoxenic from axenic cultured worms. Access to replicate quantities of age-defined worms will aid studies of alterations in homeostatic controls associated with aging and senescence.",M1
20350593,"Profiling of <e>cold</e>-stress-responsive miRNAs in rice by microarrays.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small single-stranded RNAs with a length of about 21 nt; these non-coding RNAs regulate developmental and stress responses in plants by cleaving mRNAs. Cold stress is one of the most severe abiotic stresses and adversely affects rice yields by restraining sowing time, causing tissue damage, and stunting growth. Although many miRNAs have been identified in rice, little is known about the role of miRNAs in the response to cold stress. In this study, we identified 18 cold-responsive rice miRNAs using microarrays. Most were down-regulated. Members of the miR-167 and miR-319 families showed similar profiles. Intriguingly, members of miR-171 family showed diverse expression patterns. Three miRNAs derived from transposable element sequence were clustered within an intron and proved to be co-transcribed with the host gene only under cold stress. The existence of hormone-responsive elements in the upstream regions of the cold-responsive miRNAs indicates the importance of hormones in this defense system mediated by miRNAs. Two miRNA target pairs validated by 5' RACE showed opposite expression profiles under cold stress. Finally, the predicted stress-related targets of these miRNAs provided further evidence supporting our results. These findings confirm the role of miRNAs as ubiquitous regulators in rice.",M1
20340040,"Low temperatures impact dormancy status, flowering competence, and transcript profiles in crown buds of leafy spurge.Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) is an herbaceous perennial weed that produces vegetatively from an abundance of underground adventitious buds. In this study, we report the effects of different environmental conditions on vegetative production and flowering competence, and determine molecular mechanisms associated with dormancy transitions under controlled conditions. Reduction in temperature (27-10 degrees C) and photoperiod (16-8 h) over a 3-month period induced a para- to endo-dormant transition in crown buds. An additional 11 weeks of <e>cold</e> (5-7 degrees C) and short-photoperiod resulted in accelerated shoot growth from crown buds, and 99% floral competence when plants were returned to growth-promoting conditions. Exposure of paradormant plants to short-photoperiod and prolonged cold treatment alone had minimal affect on growth potential and resulted in ~1% flowering. Likewise, endodormant crown buds without prolonged cold treatment displayed delayed shoot growth and ~2% flowering when returned to growth-promoting conditions. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 373 and 260 genes were differentially expressed (P &lt; 0.005) during para- to endo-dormant and endo- to eco-dormant transitions, respectively. Transcripts from flower competent vs. non-flower competent crown buds identified 607 differentially expressed genes. Further, sub-network analysis identified expression targets and binding partners associated with circadian clock, dehydration/cold signaling, phosphorylation cascades, and response to abscisic acid, ethylene, gibberellic acid, and jasmonic acid, suggesting these central regulators affect well-defined phases of dormancy and flowering. Potential genetic pathways associated with these dormancy transitions and flowering were used to develop a proposed conceptual model.",M1

20335373,"Expression of heat shock proteins in anoxic crucian carp (Carassius carassius): support for <e>cold</e> as a preparatory cue for anoxia.The crucian carp (Carassius carassius) tolerates anoxia for days to months depending on temperature. During episodes of stress, heat shock proteins (HSPs) are important for limiting cellular damage, mainly by ensuring protein function. Accordingly, we hypothesized that anoxia would change the expression of HSPs and that this response would be temperature dependent. Real-time RT-PCR was used to investigate the effects of 1 and 7 days anoxia (A1 and A7) on the expression of HSP70a, HSP70b, HSC70, HSP90, and HSP30 in the brain and heart of 8 degrees C- and 13 degrees C-acclimated crucian carp. In general, the expression of all HSPs changed in response to anoxia, although varying in size and direction, and with organ and temperature. HSP70a expression increased drastically (approximately 10-fold) in A7 brains and hearts at 13 degrees C but not at 8 degrees C. HSC70 and HSP90 expression decreased in A7 brains (by 60-70%), but not in A7 hearts. HSC70 expression increased in A1 brains and hearts at both temperatures (by 60-160%), and HSP30 expression decreased in A7 brains and hearts at both temperatures (by 50-80%). Notably, normoxic fish showed 7- and 11-fold higher HSP70a expression in the brain and heart at 8 degrees C compared with 13 degrees C. This difference disappeared during anoxia, suggesting that cold may function as a cue for preconditioning the crucian carp's HSP70a expression to the approaching anoxic winter period.",M1
20308403,"Early feeding affects resistance against <e>cold</e> exposure in young broiler chickens.In field conditions, a fasting period of 24 to 72 h after hatch is common, which is associated with delayed gastrointestinal development and yolk utilization and retarded subsequent performance. Hardly any information is available about the influence of diet composition in the first days on later life and additionally, effects of early feeding on thermoregulatory development are also not known. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of diet composition in early fed broiler chickens on their (thermoregulatory) development. Shortly after hatch, 200 Hybro chickens (initial BW of 43.6 g) were assigned to 1 of 5 feed treatments: control, dextrose, albumen, prestarter, or prestarter plus fat. Water was available ad libitum. Measurements were done in 10 replicates of 4 chickens per treatment. At d 2 or 3, half of the chickens were exposed to 20 degrees C for 30 min to determine resistance against cold exposure and rectal temperature was determined just before, immediately after, and 30 min after the end of this cold exposure. Thereafter, all chickens were killed to investigate body development. Chickens in both prestarter groups developed faster than in the other 3 groups, expressed by a higher BW, yolk-free body mass, heart and liver weight, and higher chick and intestine length. Between d 2 and 3, differences in these variables among chickens from both prestarter groups and other groups increased. Rectal temperature before cold exposure was higher in chickens from both prestarter groups (40.6 and 40.7 degrees C, respectively) and decreased less (0.6 and 0.7 degrees C, respectively) during cold exposure than in chickens from the control (39.5 and 1.2 degrees C, respectively) and albumen group (39.8 and 2.1 degrees C, respectively), whereas chickens from the dextrose group were in between (40.4 and 1.2 degrees C, respectively). We conclude that early fed diet composition in broiler chickens is (besides general development) important for development of both body temperature and resistance against cold exposure, probably as a reflection of a changed metabolic rate.",M1
20306286,"Proteomic approach to analyze dormancy breaking of tree seeds.In forest broadleaves from the temperate zone, a large number of species exhibit seed dormancy phenomena. Tree seeds show some of the most pronounced and complicated forms of dormancy in the plant kingdom. Many seeds are deeply physiologically dormant whatever their moisture level and age. However, dormancy can usually be overcome by a <e>cold</e> or warm stratification for several months. The transition from seed dormancy to germination is a multi-step process. In combination with the availability of genome sequence data, proteomics has opened up enormous possibilities for identifying the total set of expressed proteins as well as expression changes during dormancy breaking. The proteomic approach used for analysis of dormancy breaking of tree seeds offers new data allowing better understanding of the mechanism of deep physiological dormancy. The results of proteomic studies on dormancy breaking and the presence of abscisic and gibberellic acids in tree seeds (beech Fagus sylvatica L., Norway maple Acer platanoides L. and sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus L.), help to explain this process better. Most of the changes in protein expression were observed at the end of stratification and in the germinated seeds. This is the most active period of dormancy breaking when seeds pass from the quiescent state to germination. The analysis of the proteins' function showed that the mechanism of seed dormancy breaking involves many processes. Energy metabolism, proteasome, transcription, protein synthesis, signal transduction and methionine metabolism proteins have a special importance.",M1
20303273,"The association between personality, pain threshold and a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs3813034) in the 3'-untranslated region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4).In 181 healthy Japanese volunteers we examined the relationship between personality, sensitivity to pain and a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs3813034) in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene (SLC6A4). Pain sensitivity was assessed by using <e>cold</e> and pressure thresholds. Personality was assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Males without the T allele (G/G) showed a significantly higher spiritual acceptance (ST3) score than those who had the T allele (T/T and T/G). Females with the T allele (T/T and T/G) showed significantly higher transpersonal identification (ST2) and self-transcendence (ST) scores than those without the T allele (G/G). As for pain sensitivity and its relationship with TCI, we found a low negative correlation between cold water stimulation, disorderliness (NS4) and novelty seeking (NS) in males, whereas in females we found a low positive correlation between cold water stimulation, self-acceptance (SD4) and pure-hearted principles (C5), as well as pressure stimulation and SD4. It is possible that the 5-HTT 3' UTR gene polymorphism affects the character dimensions of Cloniger's theory, and that there might be a low correlation between pain and a part of the personality.",M1
20302399,"Measurement of coronary flow response to <e>cold</e> pressor stress in asymptomatic women with cardiovascular risk factors using spiral velocity-encoded cine MRI at 3 Tesla.Background: Coronary sinus (CS) flow in response to a provocative stress has been used as a surrogate measure of coronary flow reserve, and velocity-encoded cine (VEC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an established technique for measuring CS flow. In this study, the cold pressor test (CPT) was used to measure CS flow response because it elicits an endothelium-dependent coronary vasodilation that may afford greater sensitivity for detecting early changes in coronary endothelial function. Purpose: To investigate the feasibility and reproducibility of CS flow reactivity (CSFR) to CPT using spiral VEC MRI at 3 Tesla in a sample of asymptomatic women with cardiovascular risk factors. Material and Methods: Fourteen asymptomatic women (age 38 years +/- 10) with cardiovascular risk factors were studied using 3D spiral VEC MRI of the CS at 3 T. The CPT was utilized as a provocative stress to measure changes in CS flow. CSFR to CPT was calculated from the ratio of CS flow during peak stress to baseline CS flow. Results: CPT induced a significant hemodynamic response as measured by a 45% increase in rate-pressure product (P&lt;0.01). A significant increase in CS volume flow was also observed (baseline, 116 +/- 26 ml/min; peak stress, 152 +/- 34 ml/min, P=0.01). CSFR to CPT was 1.31 +/- 0.20. Test-retest variability of CS volume flow was 5% at baseline and 6% during peak stress. Conclusion: Spiral CS VEC MRI at 3 T is a feasible and reproducible technique for measuring CS flow in asymptomatic women at risk for cardiovascular disease. Significant changes in CSFR to CPT are detectable, without demanding pharmacologic stress.",M1
20238096,"Role of Ucp1 enhancer methylation and chromatin remodelling in the control of Ucp1 expression in murine adipose tissue.AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Increasing the expression of the brown adipose tissue-specific gene uncoupling protein-1 (Ucp1) is a potential target for treating obesity. We investigated the role of DNA methylation and histone modification in Ucp1 expression in adipose cell lines and ex vivo murine adipose tissues. METHODS: Methylation state of the Ucp1 enhancer was studied using bisulphite mapping in murine adipose cell lines, and tissue taken from <e>cold</e>-stressed mice, coupled with functional assays of the effects of methylation and demethylation of the Ucp1 promoter on gene expression and nuclear protein binding. RESULTS: We show that demethylation of the Ucp1 promoter by 5-aza-deoxycytidine increases Ucp1 expression while methylation of Ucp1 promoter-reporter constructs decreases expression. Brown adipose tissue-specific Ucp1 expression is associated with decreased CpG dinucleotide methylation of the Ucp1 enhancer. The lowest CpG dinucleotide methylation state was found in two cyclic AMP response elements (CRE3, CRE2) in the Ucp1 promoter and methylation of the CpG in CRE2, but not CRE3 decreased nuclear protein binding. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed the presence of the silencing DiMethH3K9 modification on the Ucp1 enhancer in white adipose tissue and the appearance of the active TriMethH3K4 mark at the Ucp1 promoter in brown adipose tissue in response to a cold environment. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The results demonstrate that CpG dinucleotide methylation of the Ucp1 enhancer exhibits tissue-specific patterns in murine tissue and cell lines and suggest that adipose tissue-specific Ucp1 expression involves demethylation of CpG dinucleotides found in regulatory CREs in the Ucp1 enhancer, as well as modification of histone tails.",M1

20231441,"AtBAG7, an Arabidopsis Bcl-2-associated athanogene, resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the unfolded protein response.The Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG) family is an evolutionarily conserved, multifunctional group of cochaperones that perform diverse cellular functions ranging from proliferation to growth arrest and cell death in yeast, in mammals, and, as recently observed, in plants. The Arabidopsis genome contains seven homologs of the BAG family, including four with domain organization similar to animal BAGs. In the present study we show that an Arabidopsis BAG, AtBAG7, is a uniquely localized endoplasmic reticulum (ER) BAG that is necessary for the proper maintenance of the unfolded protein response (UPR). AtBAG7 was shown to interact directly in vivo with the molecular chaperone, AtBiP2, by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, and the interaction was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assay. Treatment with an inducer of UPR, tunicamycin, resulted in accelerated cell death of AtBAG7-null mutants. Furthermore, AtBAG7 knockouts were sensitive to known ER stress stimuli, heat and <e>cold</e>. In these knockouts heat sensitivity was reverted successfully to the wild-type phenotype with the addition of the chemical chaperone, tauroursodexycholic acid (TUDCA). Real-time PCR of ER stress proteins indicated that the expression of the heat-shock protein, AtBiP3, is selectively up-regulated in AtBAG7-null mutants upon heat and cold stress. Our results reveal an unexpected diversity of the plant's BAG gene family and suggest that AtBAG7 is an essential component of the UPR during heat and cold tolerance, thus confirming the cytoprotective role of plant BAGs.",M1
20230648,"The Arabidopsis EAR-motif-containing protein RAP2.1 functions as an active transcriptional repressor to keep stress responses under tight control.BACKGROUND: Plants respond to abiotic stress through complex regulation of transcription, including both transcriptional activation and repression. Dehydration-responsive-element binding protein (DREB)-type transcription factors are well known to play important roles in adaptation to abiotic stress. The mechanisms by which DREB-type transcription factors activate stress-induced gene expression have been relatively well studied. However, little is known about how DREB-type transcriptional repressors modulate plant stress responses. In this study, we report the functional analysis of RAP2.1, a DREB-type transcriptional repressor. RESULTS: RAP2.1 possesses an APETALA2 (AP2) domain that binds to dehydration-responsive elements (DREs) and an ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, as the repression domain located at the C-terminus of the protein. Expression of RAP2.1 is strongly induced by drought and <e>cold</e> stress via an ABA-independent pathway. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing RAP2.1 show enhanced sensitivity to cold and drought stresses, while rap2.1-1 and rap2.1-2 T-DNA insertion alleles result in reduced sensitivity to these stresses. The reduced stress sensitivity of the plant containing the rap2.1 allele can be genetically complemented by the expression of RAP2.1, but not by the expression of EAR-motif-mutated RAP2.1. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis has identified Responsive to desiccation/Cold-regulated (RD/COR) genes as downstream targets of RAP2.1 in vivo. Stress-induced expression of the RD/COR genes is repressed by overexpression of RAP2.1 and is increased in plants expressing the rap2.1 allele. In addition, RAP2.1 can negatively regulate its own expression by binding to DREs present in its own promoter. Our data suggest that RAP2.1 acts as a negative transcriptional regulator in defence responses to cold and drought stress in Arabidopsis. CONCLUSIONS: A hypothetical model for the role of RAP2.1 in modulating plant responses to cold and drought is proposed in this study. It appears that RAP2.1 acts as a negative  subregulon  of DREB-type activators and is involved in the precise regulation of expression of stress-related genes, acting to keep stress responses under tight control.",M1
20228577,"Cloning of a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase gene and the responses of Caragana korshinskii to a variety of abiotic stresses.Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates plant adaptive responses to various environmental stresses. Oxidative cleavage of cis-epoxycarotenoids catalyzed by 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) is the main regulatory step in the biosynthesis of ABA in higher plants. Using RACE technology, a full-length cDNA-encoding NCED gene was isolated and characterized from the leaves of Caragana korshinskii (Peashrub). The 2442-bp full-length CkNCED1 had a 1818-bp ORF, which encodes a peptide of 605 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of CkNCED1 protein shared high identity with other NCEDs. Southern blot analysis revealed that the gene CkNCED1 was a single copy in the genome of C. korshinskii. When C. korshinskii plants were exposed to a water deficit, ABA accumulation was followed by large increases in CkNCED1 mRNA in leaves and stems, but only a moderate increase in the roots. Conversely, rehydration of stressed leaves caused a rapid decrease in CkNCED1 mRNA and ABA levels. RT-PCR and Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that salt stress rapidly induced the strong expression of CkNCED1 in leaves and roots of C. korshinskii, as well as ABA accumulation. The expression of CkNCED1 and ABA accumulation was also induced by <e>cold</e> stress and the application of exogenous ABA. Taken together, these results suggest that CkNCED1 likely plays a primary role in the biosynthesis of ABA in C. korshinskii.",M1
20225821,"The <e>cold</e> denatured state of the C-terminal domain of protein L9 is compact and contains both native and non-native structure.Cold denaturation is a general property of globular proteins, and the process provides insight into the origins of the cooperativity of protein folding and the nature of partially folded states. Unfortunately, studies of protein cold denaturation have been hindered by the fact that the cold denatured state is normally difficult to access experimentally. Special conditions such as addition of high concentrations of denaturant, encapsulation into reverse micelles, the formation of emulsified solutions, high pressure, or extremes of pH have been applied, but these can perturb the unfolded state of proteins. The cold denatured state of the C-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 can be populated under native-like conditions by taking advantage of a destabilizing point mutation which leads to cold denaturation at temperatures above 0 degrees C. This state is in slow exchange with the native state on the NMR time scale. Virtually complete backbone (15)N, (13)C, and (1)H as well as side-chain (13)C(beta) and (1)H(beta) chemical shift assignments were obtained for the cold denatured state at pH 5.7, 12 degrees C. Chemical shift analysis, backbone N-H residual dipolar couplings, amide proton NOEs, and R(2) relaxation rates all indicate that the cold denatured state of CTL9 (the C-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9) not only contains significant native-like secondary structure but also non-native structure. The regions corresponding to the two native alpha-helices show a strong tendency to populate helical Phi and Psi angles. The segment which connects alpha-helix 2 and beta-strand 2 (residues 107-124) in the native state exhibits a significant preference to form non-native helical structure in the cold denatured state. The structure observed in the cold denatured state of the I98A mutant is similar to that observed in the pH 3.8 unfolded state of wild type CTL9 at 25 degrees C, suggesting that it is a robust feature of the denatured state ensemble of this protein. The implications for protein folding and for studies of cold denatured states are discussed.",M1
20219630,"Behavioral evidence of thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia induced by intradermal cinnamaldehyde in rats.TRPA1 agonists cinnamaldehyde (CA) and mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate=AITC) induce heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in human skin, and sensitize responses of spinal and trigeminal dorsal horn neurons to noxious skin heating in rats. TRPA1 is also implicated in <e>cold</e> nociception. We presently used behavioral methods to investigate if CA affects sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli in rats. Unilateral intraplantar injection of CA (5-20%) induced a significant, concentration-dependent reduction in latency for ipsilateral paw withdrawal from a noxious heat stimulus, peaking (61.7% of pre-injection baseline) by 30 min with partial recovery at 120 min. The highest dose of CA also significantly reduced the contralateral paw withdrawal latency. CA significantly reduced mechanical withdrawal thresholds of the injected paw that peaked sooner (3 min) and was more profound (44.4% of baseline), with no effect contralaterally. Bilateral intraplantar injections of CA resulted in a significant cold hyperalgesia (cold plate test) and a weak enhancement of innocuous cold avoidance (thermal preference test). The data are consistent with roles for TRPA1 in thermal (hot and cold) hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia.",M1
20217440,"A <e>cold</e>-adapted esterase of a novel marine isolate, Pseudoalteromonas arctica: gene cloning, enzyme purification and characterization.A gene encoding an esterase (estO) was identified and sequenced from a gene library screen of the psychrotolerant bacterium Pseudoalteromonas arctica. Analysis of the 1,203 bp coding region revealed that the deduced peptide sequence is composed of 400 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 44.1 kDa. EstO contains a N-terminal esterase domain and an additional OsmC domain at the C-terminus (osmotically induced family of proteins). The highly conserved five-residue motif typical for all alpha/beta hydrolases (G x S x G) was detected from position 104 to 108 together with a putative catalytic triad consisting of Ser(106), Asp(196), and His(225). Sequence comparison showed that EstO exhibits 90% amino acid identity with hypothetical proteins containing similar esterase and OsmC domains but only around 10% identity to the amino acid sequences of known esterases. EstO variants with and without the OsmC domain were produced and purified as His-tag fusion proteins in E. coli. EstO displayed an optimum pH of 7.5 and optimum temperature of 25 degrees C with more than 50% retained activity at the freezing point of water. The thermostability of EstO (50% activity after 5 h at 40 degrees C) dramatically increased in the truncated variant (50% activity after 2.5 h at 90 degrees C). Furthermore, the esterase displays broad substrate specificity for esters of short-chain fatty acids (C(2)-C(8)).",M1
20213333,"Light and temperature sensing and signaling in induction of bud dormancy in woody plants.In woody species cycling between growth and dormancy must be precisely synchronized with the seasonal climatic variations. Cessation of apical growth, resulting from exposure to short photoperiod (SD) and altered light quality, is gating the chain of events resulting in bud dormancy and <e>cold</e> hardiness. The relative importance of these light parameters, sensed by phytochromes and possibly a blue light receptor, varies with latitude. Early in SD, changes in expression of light signaling components dominate. In Populus active shoot elongation is linked to high expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) resulting from coincidence of high levels of CONSTANS and light at the end of days longer than a critical one. In Picea, PaFT4 expression increases substantially in response to SD. Thus, in contrast to Populus-FT, PaFT4 appears to function in inhibition of shoot elongation or promotion of growth cessation. Accordingly, different FT-genes appear to have opposite effects in photoperiodic control of shoot elongation. Reduction in gibberellin under SD is involved in control of growth cessation and bud formation, but not further dormancy development. Coinciding with formation of a closed bud, abscisic acid activity increases and cell-proliferation genes are down-regulated. When dormancy is established very few changes in gene expression occur. Thus, maintenance of dormancy is not dependent on comprehensive transcriptional regulation. In some species low temperature induces growth cessation and dormancy, in others temperature affects photoperiod requirement. The temperature under SD affects both the rate of growth cessation, bud formation and depth of dormancy. As yet, information on the molecular basis of these responses to temperature is scarce.",M1
20210619,"Aural canal, esophageal, and rectal temperatures during exertional heat stress and the subsequent recovery period.CONTEXT: The measurement of body temperature is crucial for the initial diagnosis of exertional heat injury and for monitoring purposes during a subsequent treatment strategy. However, little information is available about how different measurements of body temperature respond during and after exertional heat stress. OBJECTIVE: To present the temporal responses of aural canal (T(ac)), esophageal (T(es)), and rectal (T(re)) temperatures during 2 different scenarios (S1, S2) involving exertional heat stress and a subsequent recovery period. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: University research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers, with 12 (5 men, 7 women) participating in S1 and 12 (7 men, 5 women) participating in S2. Intervention(s): The participants exercised in the heat (42 degrees C, 30% relative humidity) until they reached a 39.5 degrees C cut-off criterion, which was determined by T(re) in S1 and by T(es) in S2. As such, participants attained different levels of hyperthermia (as determined by T(re)) at the end of exercise. Participants in S1 were subsequently immersed in <e>cold</e> water (2 degrees C) until T(re) reached 37.5 degrees C, and participants in S2 recovered in a temperate environment (30 degrees C, 30% relative humidity) for 60 minutes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We measured T(ac), T(es), and T(re) throughout both scenarios. RESULTS: The T(es) (S1 = 40.19 +/- 0.41 degrees C, S2 = 39.50 +/- 0.02 degrees C) was higher at the end of exercise compared with both T(ac) (S1 = 39.74 +/- 0.42 degrees C, S2 = 38.89 +/- 0.32 degrees C) and T(re) (S1 = 39.41 +/- 0.04 degrees C, S2 = 38.74 +/- 0.28 degrees C) (for both comparisons in each scenario, P &lt; .001). Conversely, T(es) (S1 = 36.26 +/- 0.74 degrees C, S2 = 37.36 +/- 0.34 degrees C) and T(ac) (S1 = 36.48 +/- 1.07 degrees C, S2 = 36.97 +/- 0.38 degrees C) were lower compared with T(re) (S1 = 37.54 +/- 0.04 degrees C, S2 = 37.78 +/- 0.31 degrees C) at the end of both scenarios (for both comparisons in each scenario, P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: We found that T(ac), T(es), and T(re) presented different temporal responses during and after both scenarios of exertional heat stress and a subsequent recovery period. Although these results may not have direct practical implications in the field monitoring and treatment of individuals with exertional heat injury, they do quantify the extent to which these body temperature measurements differ in such scenarios.",M1
20206599,"A novel <e>cold</e>-regulated gene from Camellia sinensis, CsCOR1, enhances salt- and dehydration-tolerance in tobacco.In present research, the full-length cDNA and the genomic sequence of a novel cold-regulated gene, CsCOR1, were isolated from Camellia sinensis L. The deduced protein CsCOR1 contains a hydrophobic N-terminus as a signal peptide and a hydrophilic C-terminal domain that is rich in glycine, arginine and proline. Two internal repetitive tridecapeptide fragments (HSVTAGRGGYNRG) exist in the middle of the C-terminal domain and the two nucleotide sequences encoding them are identical. CsCOR1 was localized in the cell walls of transgenic-tobaccos via CsCOR1::GFP fusion approach. The expression of CsCOR1 in tea leaves was enhanced dramatically by both cold- and dehydration-stress. And overexpression of CsCOR1 in transgenic-tobaccos improved obviously the tolerance to salinity and dehydration.",M1
20203611,"SIRT3 regulates mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation by reversible enzyme deacetylation.Sirtuins are NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases. They mediate adaptive responses to a variety of stresses, including calorie restriction and metabolic stress. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it regulates the acetylation levels of metabolic enzymes, including acetyl coenzyme A synthetase 2 (refs 1, 2). Mice lacking both Sirt3 alleles appear phenotypically normal under basal conditions, but show marked hyperacetylation of several mitochondrial proteins. Here we report that SIRT3 expression is upregulated during fasting in liver and brown adipose tissues. During fasting, livers from mice lacking SIRT3 had higher levels of fatty-acid oxidation intermediate products and triglycerides, associated with decreased levels of fatty-acid oxidation, compared to livers from wild-type mice. Mass spectrometry of mitochondrial proteins shows that long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD) is hyperacetylated at lysine 42 in the absence of SIRT3. LCAD is deacetylated in wild-type mice under fasted conditions and by SIRT3 in vitro and in vivo; and hyperacetylation of LCAD reduces its enzymatic activity. Mice lacking SIRT3 exhibit hallmarks of fatty-acid oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and intolerance to <e>cold</e> exposure. These findings identify acetylation as a novel regulatory mechanism for mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation and demonstrate that SIRT3 modulates mitochondrial intermediary metabolism and fatty-acid use during fasting.",M1
20197300,"Adding cocoa to sucrose: the effect on <e>cold</e> pain tolerance.The sweet taste of sucrose acts as an analgesic, whereas the taste of a bitter substance decreases pain tolerance. The present experiment explores the analgesic effect of a complex taste and asks how adding cocoa, a substance often associated with sweet foods but that has a bitter taste, to a sucrose solution affects cold pain tolerance. The 24 male participants were exposed to Cold Pressor Tests (CPTs) while holding 1 of 3 tastants in their mouths: water, sucrose, or sucrose with cocoa added. After each CPT, participants rated pain intensity and tastant qualities. Intraoral sucrose increased the amount of time that men were able to leave their hands in cold water, whereas the cocoa solution did not. Solutions did not differ in pleasantness or sweetness, but the cocoa solution was rated as more bitter. Bitterness ratings of cocoa exceeded the ratings of sucrose (corrected for water) by an average of 16.9% (P = 0.02), which, in turn, produced a 30% reduction in the duration of pain tolerance (P = 0.002). These results suggest that the addition of a bitter substance reduces cues to the nutritive value of sucrose that may drive its analgesic effect.",M1
20194142,"Thermal hypoaesthesia differentiates secondary restless legs syndrome associated with small fibre neuropathy from primary restless legs syndrome.This study aimed to assess thermal and mechanical perception and pain thresholds in primary idiopathic restless legs syndrome and secondary restless legs syndrome associated with small fibre neuropathy. Twenty-one patients (age: 53.4 + or - 8.4, n = 3, male) with primary restless legs syndrome and 13 patients (age: 63.0 + or - 8.2, n = 1, male) with secondary restless legs syndrome associated with small fibre neuropathy were compared with 20 healthy subjects (age: 58.0 + or - 7.0; n = 2, male). Differential diagnosis of secondary restless legs syndrome associated with small fibre neuropathy was based on clinical symptoms and confirmed with skin biopsies in all patients. A comprehensive quantitative sensory testing protocol encompassing thermal and mechanical detection and pain thresholds, as devised by the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain, was performed on the clinically more affected foot between 2 pm and 1 am when restless legs syndrome symptoms were present in all patients. Patients with primary restless legs syndrome showed hyperalgesia to blunt pressure (P &lt; 0.001), pinprick (P &lt; 0.001) and vibratory hyperaesthesia (P &lt; 0.001). Patients with secondary restless legs syndrome associated with small fibre neuropathy showed thermal hypoaesthesia to <e>cold</e> (Adelta-fibre mediated) and warm (C-fibre mediated) (all P &lt; 0.001) and hyperalgesia to pinprick (P &lt; 0.001). Static mechanical hyperalgesia in primary and secondary restless legs syndrome is consistent with the concept of central disinhibition of nociceptive pathways, which might be induced by conditioning afferent input from damaged small fibre neurons in secondary restless legs syndrome.",M1
20193128,"Response and transcriptional regulation of rice SUMOylation system during development and stress conditions.Modification of proteins by the reversible covalent addition of the small ubiquitin like modifier (SUMO) protein has important consequences affecting target protein stability, sub-cellular localization, and protein-protein interactions. SUMOylation involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions, which resembles the process of ubiquitination. In this study, we characterized the SUMOylation system from an important crop plant, rice, and show that it responds to <e>cold</e>, salt and ABA stress conditions on a protein level via the accumulation of SUMOylated proteins. We also characterized the transcriptional regulation of individual SUMOylation cascade components during stress and development. During stress conditions, majority of the SUMO cascade components are transcriptionally down regulated. SUMO conjugate proteins and SUMO cascade component transcripts accumulated differentially in various tissues during plant development with highest levels in reproductive tissues. Taken together, these data suggest a role for SUMOylation in rice development and stress responses.",M1
20191264,"Inactivation of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus plantarum in relation to membrane permeabilization due to rapid chilling followed by <e>cold</e> storage.The relationship between membrane permeabilization and loss of viability by chilling depending on the chilling rate was investigated in two bacterial models: one Gram-positive bacterium, Lactobacillus plantarum, and one Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli. Cells were cold shocked slowly (2 degrees C/min) or rapidly (2,000 degrees C/min) from physiological temperature to 0 degrees C and maintained at this temperature for up to 1 week. Loss of membrane integrity was assessed by the uptake of the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI). Cell death was found to be strongly dependent on the rate of temperature downshift to 0 degrees C. Prolonged incubation of cells after the chilling emphasized the effect of treatment on the cells, as the amount of cell death increased with the length of exposure to low temperature, particularly when cells were rapidly chilled. More than 5 and 3-log reductions in cell population were obtained with L. plantarum and E. coli after the rapid cold shock followed by 7-day storage, respectively. A correlation between cell inactivation and membrane permeabilization was demonstrated with both bacterial strains. Thus, loss of membrane integrity due to the chilling treatments was directly involved in the inactivation of vegetative bacterial cells.",M1
20190083,"Identification of Bacillus cereus genes specifically expressed during growth at low temperatures.The mechanisms involved in the ability of Bacillus cereus to multiply at low temperatures were investigated. It was assumed that many genes involved in <e>cold</e> acclimation would be upregulated at low temperatures. Recombinase-based in vivo expression technology (IVET) was adapted to the detection of the transient activation of B. cereus promoters during growth at 10 degrees C. Four independent screenings of a promoter library from type strain ATCC 14579 were performed, and 17 clones were isolated. They corresponded to 17 promoter regions that displayed reproducibly elevated expression at 10 degrees C relative to expression at 30 degrees C. This analysis revealed several genes that may be important for B. cereus to grow successfully under the restrictive conditions of cold habitats. Among them, a locus corresponding to open reading frames BC5402 to BC5398, harboring a lipase-encoding gene and a putative transcriptional regulator, was identified three times. While a mutation in the putative regulator-encoding gene did not cause any particular phenotype, a mutant deficient in the lipase-encoding gene showed reduced growth abilities at low temperatures compared with the parental strain. The mutant did not change its fatty acid profiles in the same way as the wild type when grown at 12 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a promoter trap strategy for identifying cold-induced genes. It outlines a first picture of the different processes involved in B. cereus cold acclimation.",M1
20188031,"The spermatozoa of the dasyurid marsupial, Sminthopsis crassicaudata, are highly susceptible to <e>cold</e> shock.Since the late 1970s research has suggested that marsupial spermatozoa did not suffer cold shock. We have re-examined cold shock to investigate problems with freezing of spermatozoa from a dasyurid marsupial, the fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata). Epididymal spermatozoa were rapidly cooled to 0.5 degrees C in a pre-cooled tube held in an iced-water slurry. Upon re-warming all spermatozoa were immotile and the addition of 10% or 20% egg yolk to the sperm medium had no beneficial effect. Spermatozoa that were rapidly cooled to 4 degrees C maintained only 2% motility when re-warmed but the addition of at least 10% egg yolk was beneficial and upon re-warming greater than 65% of the initial motility was maintained. In order to achieve motile spermatozoa at 0 degrees C, controlled-rate cooling at 0.5 degrees C min(-1) was examined. In the absence of egg yolk there was a significant decline in the percentage of motile spermatozoa below 4 degrees C. However, the inclusion of at least 10% egg yolk resulted in no loss of motility in spermatozoa cooled to 0 degrees C. This is the first experimental study indicating that spermatozoa from a marsupial are highly susceptible to cold shock and that the impact of rapid chilling can be mitigated by the addition of 10% egg yolk. The ability to successfully cool the spermatozoa of S. crassicaudata to 0 degrees C may have an important role in future studies examining dasyurid sperm cryopreservation.",M1
20186812,"<e>Cold</e>-induced sweating syndrome with neonatal features of Crisponi syndrome: longitudinal observation of a patient homozygous for a CRLF1 mutation.Cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in CRLF1 (cytokine receptor-like factor 1), characterized by profuse sweating in cold environmental temperature and craniofacial and skeletal features. Mutations in CRLF1 also cause Crisponi syndrome (CS), characterized by neonatal-onset paroxysmal muscular contractions as well as craniofacial and skeletal manifestations and abnormal functions of the autonomic nerve system. To date, it is an unresolved problem whether the two conditions are distinct clinical entities or a single clinical entity with variable expressions or with different presentations depending on the patients' age at diagnosis. We report on a 30-year-old Japanese woman with CISS and homozygous out-of-frame 23-base deletion of CRLF1. In infancy, she did not show paroxysmal muscular contractions, but showed feeding difficulty, hyperthermia, and facial characteristics including thick and arched eyebrows, a short nose with anteverted nostrils, full cheeks, an inverted upper lip, and a small mouth, resembling those observed in CS. Profuse sweating was noticed at 3 years of age. Cold-induced sweating was recognized in her elementary school days. In adolescence to adulthood, she showed a Marfanoid habitus with progressive kyphoscoliosis and craniofacial characteristics including dolichocephaly, a slender face with poor expression, a distinctive nose with hypoplastic nares, malar hypoplasia, prognathism, and a small mouth. This is the first report of detailed longitudinal observation of a patient with CRLF1 abnormalities, compatible with the notion that CISS and CS may be a single clinical entity.",M1
20185615,"Motor and sensory nerve conduction are affected differently by ice pack, ice massage, and <e>cold</e> water immersion.BACKGROUND: It is well known that reducing tissue temperature changes sensory and motor nerve conduction. However, few studies have compared the effect of different cold modalities on nerve conduction parameters. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ice pack, ice massage, and cold water immersion on the conduction parameters of the sural (sensorial) and tibial motor nerves. DESIGN: An experimental study was conducted in which the participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups (n=12 per group). Independent variables were cold modality and pre- and post-cooling measurement time. Dependent variables were skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters. METHODS: Thirty-six people who were healthy, with a mean (SD) age of 20.5 (1.9) years, participated in the study. Each group received 1 of the 3 cold modalities, applied to the right calf region for 15 minutes. Skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters were measured before and immediately after cooling. RESULTS: All 3 modalities reduced skin temperature (mean=18.2 degrees C). There also was a reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency and duration of the compound action potential. Ice massage, ice pack, and cold water immersion reduced sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) by 20.4, 16.7, and 22.6 m/s and motor NCV by 2.5, 2.1, and 8.3 m/s, respectively. Cold water immersion was the most effective modality in changing nerve conduction parameters. LIMITATIONS: The cooling area of the ice massage and ice pack was smaller than that of the cold water immersion. The examiner was not blinded to the treatment group. The population included only participants who were healthy and young. CONCLUSIONS: All 3 modalities were effective in reducing skin temperature and changing sensory conduction at a physiological level that is sufficient to induce a hypoalgesic effect. The results suggest that cold water immersion, as applied in this study, is the most indicated modality for inducing therapeutic effects associated with the reduction of motor nerve conduction.",M1
20185542,"RNase R is a highly unstable protein regulated by growth phase and stress.RNase R is an important exoribonuclease that participates in the degradation of structured RNAs in Escherichia coli. In earlier work, it was shown that RNase R levels increase dramatically under certain stress conditions, particularly during <e>cold</e> shock and stationary phase. However, the regulatory processes that lead to this elevation are not well understood. We show here that the increase in RNase R in stationary phase is unaffected by the global regulators, RpoS and (p)ppGpp, and that it occurs despite a major reduction in rnr message. Rather, we find that RNase R is a highly unstable protein in exponential phase, with a half-life of approximately 10 min, and that the protein is stabilized in stationary phase, leading to its relative increase. RNase R is also stabilized during cold shock and by growth in minimal medium, two other conditions that lead to its elevation. These data demonstrate that RNase R is subject to regulation by a novel, posttranslational mechanism that may have important implications for our complete understanding of RNA metabolism.",M1
20183542,"Generating physical symptoms from visual cues: An experimental study.This experimental study explored whether the physical symptoms of <e>cold</e>, pain and itchiness could be generated by visual cues, whether they varied in the ease with which they could be generated and whether they were related to negative affect. Participants were randomly allocated by group to watch one of three videos relating to cold (e.g. ice, snow, wind), pain (e.g. sporting injuries, tattoos) or itchiness (e.g. head lice, scratching). They then rated their self-reported symptoms of cold, pain and itchiness as well as their negative affect (depression and anxiety). The researcher recorded their observed behaviour relating to these symptoms. The results showed that the interventions were successful and that all three symptoms could be generated by the visual cues in terms of both self-report and observed behaviour. In addition, the pain video generated higher levels of anxiety and depression than the other two videos. Further, the degree of itchiness was related to the degree of anxiety. This symptom onset process also showed variability between symptoms with self-reported cold symptoms being greater than either pain or itchy symptoms. The results show that physical symptoms can be generated by visual cues indicating that psychological factors are not only involved in symptom perception but also in symptom onset.",M1

20179969,"Regulation of gene expression by chromosome 5A during <e>cold</e> hardening in wheat.Cold hardening is necessary to achieve the genetically determined maximum freezing tolerance and to reduce yield losses in winter cereals. The aim of the present study was to determine a set of genes with an important role in this process, by comparing of chromosome 5A substitution lines with different levels of freezing tolerance, since chromosome 5A is a major regulator of this trait. During 21 days of treatment at 2 degrees C, 303 genes were up-regulated, while 222 were down-regulated at most sampling points, and 156 at around half of them (out of the 10,297 unigenes studied). The freezing-tolerant substitution line exhibited 1.5 times as many differentially expressed genes than the sensitive one. The transcription of 78 genes (39 up-regulated) proved to be chromosome 5A-dependent. These genes encoded proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, defence processes and carbohydrate metabolism. Three of the chromosome 5A-related genes, coding for a cold-responsive, a Ca-binding and an embryo and meristem-related protein, were genetically mapped and characterized in further detail. The present experimental system was appropriate for the selection of chromosome 5A-related genes involved in short- and long-term cold acclimation in wheat. By modifying the expression of these genes it may be possible to improve freezing tolerance.",M1

Psychromonas artica KOPRI 22215 has an optimal growth temperature of 10 degrees C and a maximum growth temperature of 25 degrees C, suggesting this bacterium is a psychrophile. Cold shock proteins (Csps) are induced upon temperature downshift by more than 10 degrees C. Functional studies have researched mostly Csps of a mesophilic bacterium Escherichia coli, but not on those of psychrophilic bacteria. In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms of psychrophilic bacteria that allow it withstand freezing environments, we cloned a gene encoding a cold shock protein from P. artica KOPRI 22215 (CspA(Pa)) using the conserved sequences in csp genes. The 204 bp-long ORF encoded a protein of 68 amino acids, sharing 56% homology to previously reported E. coli CspA protein. When CspA(Pa) was overexpressed in E. coli, it caused cell growth-retardation and morphological elongation. Interestingly, overexpression of CspA(Pa) drastically increased the host's cold-resistance by more than ten times, suggesting the protein aids survival in polar environments.",M1

DEAD-box proteins constitute a ubiquitous family of RNA-dependent ATPases that can often unwind short RNA duplexes in vitro (helicase activity), hence the belief that one of their major (though not exclusive) roles in vivo is to assist in RNA rearrangements. Here, we compare two Escherichia coli DEAD-box proteins and their orthologs from the psychrophilic bacteria Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis and Colwellia psychrerythraea from the point of view of enzymatic properties. One of these proteins (SrmB) is involved in ribosome assembly, whereas the other (RhlE) presumably participates in both mRNA degradation and ribosome assembly; in vitro, RhlE is far more active as a helicase than SrmB. The activation energy associated with the ATPase activity of the psychrophilic SrmB is lower than for its mesophilic counterpart, making it more active at low temperatures. In contrast, in the case of psychrophilic RhlE, it is the RNA unwinding activity, not the ATPase activity, that has a reduced activation energy and is therefore cold-adapted. We argue that these different modes of cold adaptation reflect the likely function of these proteins in vivo: RNA helicase for RhlE and ATP-dependent RNA binding for SrmB. The cold adaptation of helicases like RhlE presumably facilitates RNA metabolism in psychrophilic bacteria.",M1
20166408,"The use of warm air stream for solvent evaporation: effects on the durability of resin-dentin bonds.This study evaluated the effect of a warm (W) or <e>cold</e> (C) air-dry stream for solvent evaporation on the immediate (IM) and six-month (6M) resin-dentin bond strength (microTBS) and silver nitrate uptake pattern (SNU) of two-step etch-and-rinse adhesive system (Adper Single Bond [SB] and Prime &amp; Bond 2.1 [PB]). The adhesives were applied on demineralized dentin surfaces and a warm or cold air-dry stream (10 seconds) was applied followed by light-activation (10 seconds). After 24-hours of water storage, the specimens were serially sectioned in the  x  and  y  directions to obtain bonded sticks around 0.8 mm2 to be tested immediately or after six months of water storage. The specimens at each period were immersed in a 50% solution of silver nitrate, photodeveloped and analyzed by SEM for SNU. Higher IM microTBS values were observed for SB under W conditions. Both adhesives showed reductions in microTBS after 6M in both air temperatures. Regarding SEM, a low silver nitrate uptake was observed in the W groups either in IM or 6M for both adhesives.",M1
20163625,"Effects of boning method and postmortem aging on meat quality characteristics of pork loin.This work investigated the effects of boning method and postmortem aging on pork loin color, shearing value and sensory attributes. Two experiments were assigned. In Experiment I, 30 Chinese native black pigs were slaughtered and their carcasses were divided into three groups: (i) hot-boning: carcasses were fabricated within 45 min postmortem just after dressing; (ii) <e>cold</e> boning at 24 h: carcasses were fabricated after chilling at 0 degrees C for 24 h; (iii) cold boning at 36 h: carcasses were fabricated after chilling at 0 degrees C for 36 h. In Experiment II, right sides of the second group in Experiment I were used and primal cuts were vacuum packed and aged for 1 day, 8 days and 16 days. Pork loins (Longissimus lumborum) were used for color measurement, shearing test, and sensory evaluation. Among three boning methods, cold-boning at 36 h postmortem had the advantages of giving muscles a better color, the lowest cooking loss and cooked shearing value, and the highest sensory tenderness, juiciness, flavor and overall liking. Postmortem aging could improve pork quality characteristics, but it is not the fact that the longer aging time is, the better pork quality would be. Eight days may be enough to obtain an acceptable sensory attribute. These results are meaningful for pork processing and pork consumption.",M1
20163266,"Pharmacological strategies against <e>cold</e> ischemia reperfusion injury.IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Good organ preservation is a determinant of graft outcome after revascularization. The necessity of increasing the quality of organ preservation, as well as of extending cold storage time, has made it necessary to consider the use of pharmacological additives. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The complex physiopathology of cold-ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury--and in particular cell death, mitochondrial injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress--are reviewed. Basic principles of the formulation of the different preservation solutions are discussed. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Current strategies and new trends in static organ preservation using additives such as trimetazidine, polyethylene glycols, melatonin, trophic factors and endothelin antagonists in solution are presented and discussed. The benefits and mechanisms responsible for enhancing organ protection against I/R injury are also discussed. Graft preservation was substantially improved when additives were added to the preservation solutions. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Enrichment of preservation solutions by additives is clinically useful only for short periods. For longer periods of cold ischemia, the use of such additives becomes insufficient because graft function deteriorates as a result of ischemia. In such conditions, the preservation strategy should be changed by the use of machine perfusion in normothermic conditions.",M1
20160405,"Subjective musculoskeletal symptoms in winter and summer among indoor working construction electricians.To evaluate the effects of <e>cold</e> exposure on the musculoskeletal system, two surveys on the subjective musculoskeletal symptoms among male electricians working in the buildings under construction were performed in winter (N=74) and summer seasons (N=83). A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on age, occupational career, working habit, present illness, and subjective musculoskeletal symptoms. Mean age, occupational career and daily smoking of the supervisors were significantly higher than those of the other subjects. In general, prevalence rates of stiffness, numbness, pain and Raynaud's phenomenon in the fingers, finger cold sensation, dull movement of the fingers, pain in the wrist, knee joint pain, pain and numbness in the foot and foot cold sensation in winter were significantly higher than those in summer. These results were marked especially in the workers except supervisors. In winter, there were no significant differences in the prevalence rates of subjective musculoskeletal complaints between the supervisors and the other workers. On the other hand, in summer, prevalence of stiffness and pain in the shoulder, stiffness and pain in the neck, dullness and pain in the arm, finger cold sensation, low back dullness and low back pain in the supervisors were significantly higher than those in the other workers. These results suggest that effects of cold on the musculoskeletal symptoms markedly appeared in the workers except supervisors.",M1
20157578,"Surviving in the <e>cold</e>: yeast mutants with extended hibernating lifespan are oxidant sensitive.Metabolic activity generates oxidizing molecules throughout life, but it is still debated if the resulting damage of macromolecules is a causality, or consequence, of the aging process. This problem demands for studying growth- and longevity phenotypes separately. Here, we assayed a complete collection of haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae knock-out strains for their capacity to endure long periods at low metabolic rates. Deletion of 93 genes, predominantly factors of primary metabolism, allowed yeast to survive for more than 58 months in the cold. The majority of these deletion strains were not resistant against oxidants or reductants, but many were hypersensitive. Hence, survival at low metabolic rates has limiting genetic components, and correlates with stress resistance inversely. Indeed, maintaining the energy consuming anti-oxidative machinery seems to be disadvantageous under coldroom conditions.",M1
20156199,"Proteolytic processing of an Arabidopsis membrane-bound NAC transcription factor is triggered by <e>cold</e>-induced changes in membrane fluidity.Changes in membrane fluidity are the earliest cellular events that occur in plant cells upon exposure to cold. This subsequently triggers physiological processes, such as calcium influx and reorganization of actin cytoskeletons, and induces expression of cold-responsive genes. The plasma-membrane-anchored NAC (NAM/ATAF/CUC) transcription factor NTL6 is of particular interest. Cold triggers proteolytic activation of the dormant NTL6 protein, which in turn elicits pathogen-resistance responses by inducing a small group of cold-inducible PR (pathogenesis-related) genes in Arabidopsis. In the present study, we show that proteolytic processing of NTL6 is regulated by cold-induced remodelling of membrane fluidity. NTL6 processing was stimulated rapidly by cold. The protein stability of NTL6 was also enhanced by cold. The effects of cold on NTL6 processing and protein stability were significantly reduced in cold-acclimatized plants, supporting the regulation of NTL6 processing by membrane fluidity. Consistent with this, although NTL6 processing was stimulated by pharmacological agents that reduce membrane fluidity and thus mimic cold, it was inhibited when plants were treated with a 18:3 unsaturated fatty acid, linolenic acid. In addition, the pattern of NTL6 processing was changed in Arabidopsis mutants with altered membrane lipid compositions. Assays employing chemicals that inhibit activities of the proteasome and proteases showed that NTL6 processing occurs via the regulated intramembrane proteolysis mechanism. Interestingly, a metalloprotease inhibitor blocked the NTL6 processing. These observations indicate that a metalloprotease activity is responsible for NTL6 processing in response to cold-induced changes in membrane fluidity.",M1
20154352,"Synapsin is selectively required for anesthesia-sensitive memory.Odor-shock memory in Drosophila melanogaster consists of heterogeneous components each with different dynamics. We report that a null mutant for the evolutionarily conserved synaptic protein Synapsin entails a memory deficit selectively in early memory, leaving later memory as well as sensory motor function unaffected. Notably, a consolidated memory component remaining after <e>cold</e>-anesthesia is not impaired, suggesting that only anesthesia-sensitive memory [ASM] depends on Synapsin. The lack of Synapsin does not further impair the memory deficit of mutants for the rutabaga gene encoding the type I adenylyl cyclase. This suggests that cAMP signaling, through a Synapsin-dependent mechanism, may underlie the formation of a labile memory component.",M1
20154260,"Increased muscle sympathetic nerve activity acutely alters conduit artery shear rate patterns.Escalating evidence indicates that disturbed flow patterns, characterized by the presence of retrograde and oscillatory shear stress, induce a proatherogenic endothelial cell phenotype; however, the mechanisms underlying oscillatory shear profiles in peripheral conduit arteries are not fully understood. We tested the hypothesis that acute elevations in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) are accompanied by increases in conduit artery retrograde and oscillatory shear. Fourteen healthy men (25 +/- 1 yr) performed three sympathoexcitatory maneuvers: graded lower body negative pressure (LBNP) from 0 to -40 Torr, <e>cold</e> pressor test (CPT), and 35% maximal voluntary contraction handgrip followed by postexercise ischemia (PEI). MSNA (microneurography; peroneal nerve), arterial blood pressure (finger photoplethysmography), and brachial artery velocity and diameter (duplex Doppler ultrasound) in the contralateral arm were recorded continuously. All maneuvers elicited significant increases in MSNA total activity from baseline (P &lt; 0.05). Retrograde shear (-3.96 +/- 1.2 baseline vs. -8.15 +/- 1.8 s(-1), -40 LBNP, P &lt; 0.05) and oscillatory shear index (0.09 +/- 0.02 baseline vs. 0.20 +/- 0.02 arbitrary units, -40 LBNP, P &lt; 0.05) were progressively augmented during graded LBNP. In contrast, during CPT and PEI, in which MSNA and blood pressure were concomitantly increased (P &lt; 0.05), minimal or no changes in retrograde and oscillatory shear were noted. These data suggest that acute elevations in MSNA are associated with an increase in conduit artery retrograde and oscillatory shear, an effect that may be influenced by concurrent increases in arterial blood pressure. Future studies should examine the complex interaction between MSNA, arterial blood pressure, and other potential modulatory factors of shear rate patterns.",M1
20154119,"The genome sequence of Psychrobacter arcticus 273-4, a psychroactive Siberian permafrost bacterium, reveals mechanisms for adaptation to low-temperature growth.Psychrobacter arcticus strain 273-4, which grows at temperatures as low as -10 degrees C, is the first <e>cold</e>-adapted bacterium from a terrestrial environment whose genome was sequenced. Analysis of the 2.65-Mb genome suggested that some of the strategies employed by P. arcticus 273-4 for survival under cold and stress conditions are changes in membrane composition, synthesis of cold shock proteins, and the use of acetate as an energy source. Comparative genome analysis indicated that in a significant portion of the P. arcticus proteome there is reduced use of the acidic amino acids and proline and arginine, which is consistent with increased protein flexibility at low temperatures. Differential amino acid usage occurred in all gene categories, but it was more common in gene categories essential for cell growth and reproduction, suggesting that P. arcticus evolved to grow at low temperatures. Amino acid adaptations and the gene content likely evolved in response to the long-term freezing temperatures (-10 degrees C to -12 degrees C) of the Kolyma (Siberia) permafrost soil from which this strain was isolated. Intracellular water likely does not freeze at these in situ temperatures, which allows P. arcticus to live at subzero temperatures.",M1
20151817,"The relationship of metabolic performance and distribution in black-capped and Carolina chickadees.In endotherms, metabolic performance is associated with a wide array of ecological traits, including species distribution. Researchers have suggested that the northern boundaries of North American passerines are limited by their ability to sustain the high metabolic rates required for thermoregulation. Black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus; BC) are year-round residents in most of Canada and the northern half of the United States, whereas Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis; CA) are found exclusively in the southeastern United States. These species hybridize along a narrow contact zone that has been moving northward at a rate of about 1.6 km per decade, coincident with warming temperatures in Ohio. The location of the chickadee hybrid zone in Ohio closely matches air temperature isotherms, further suggesting that metabolic rate may correlate with distribution in these species. We tested the hypothesis that distribution patterns of chickadees are linked with their rate of metabolism. For populations of BC and CA chickadees, we measured basal metabolic rates (BMRs) and <e>cold</e>-induced peak metabolic rates from areas that differ in winter temperatures and supplemented this information with data from other studies. Although our findings suggest a general relationship between lower air temperatures and higher metabolic rate among black-capped chickadee populations, this trend was not robust across all locations. There was no significant relationship between lower air temperatures and metabolism in Carolina chickadees. Within Ohio, hybrids had a significantly higher mass-corrected BMR than either parental species. We suggest that the mtDNA-nDNA mismatch of hybrids may produce less efficient mitochondrial protein complexes, which in turn affects the efficiency of ATP production, thereby increasing rate of oxygen consumption to meet ATP demands.",M1
20151600,"[Comparative evaluation of heat state in workers exposed to heating microclimate during <e>cold</e> and warm seasons]The authors demonstrated differences in heat state among workers exposed to heating microclimate during cold and warm seasons. Same external thermal load in cold season induces more humidity loss, lower weighted average skin temperature, higher pulse rate, increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure. With that, heat discomfort was more in cold season, than in warm one, this necessitates decrease of thermal load in cold season vs. the warm one.",M1
20151059,"Exposure to extreme <e>cold</e> lowers the ischemic threshold in coronary artery disease patients.BACKGROUND: Cold temperature is known to commonly precipitate angina pectoris in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). It was previously shown that the ischemic threshold was lower during exercise testing at -8 degrees C than at +20 degrees C in patients with a history of cold-induced angina, whereas it was unchanged in patients without cold-induced angina. Few data exist on the impact of more severe cold exposure on myocardial ischemia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of extreme cold exposure (-20 degrees C) on the ischemic threshold among CAD patients. METHODS: Thirteen men with CAD and documented exercise-induced ischemia performed two treadmill exercise tests, one at +20 degrees C and one at -20 degrees C, in random order. Electrocardiograms were recorded every 30 s and analyzed separately in random order by two experienced readers blinded to temperature. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) time to ischemic electrical threshold was 53+/-60 s lower at -20 degrees C than at +20 degrees C (P=0.008), corresponding to a relative change of -8.0+/-10.5%. All other exercise parameters, including total exercise time and rate-pressure product, were unchanged during exposure to extreme cold. CONCLUSION: Exposure to extreme cold (-20 degrees C) lowers the ischemic threshold during exercise testing in patients with CAD, even if asymptomatic or without a history of cold-induced angina. Patients with CAD and evidence of exertional angina or myocardial ischemia wishing to perform exercise at extremely low temperatures should discuss this matter with their physicians.",M1

20144187,"Spatial variability of climate effects on ischemic heart disease hospitalization rates for the period 1989-2006 in Quebec, Canada.BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested an association between climate variables and circulatory diseases. The short-term effect of climate conditions on the incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) over the 1989-2006 period was examined for Quebec's 18 health regions. METHODS: Analyses were carried out for two age groups. A GAM statistical model, that blends the properties of generalized linear models with additive models, was used to fit the standardized daily hospitalization rates for IHD and their relationship with climatic conditions up to two weeks prior to the day of admission, controlling for time trends, day of the season and gender. RESULTS: Results show that, in most of Quebec's regions, <e>cold</e> temperatures during winter months and hot episodes during the summer months are associated with an increase of up to 12% in the daily hospital admission rate for IHD but also show decreased risks in some areas. The risk of hospitalization is higher for men and women of 45-64 years and varies spatially. In most regions, exposure to a continuous period of cold or hot temperature was more harmful than just one isolated day of extreme weather. Men aged 45-64 years showed higher risk levels of IHD than women of the same age group. In most regions, the annual maximum of daily IHD admissions for 65 years old was reached earlier in the season for both genders and both seasons compared to younger age groups. The effects of meteorological variables on the daily IHD admissions rate were more pronounced in regions with high smoking prevalence and high deprivation index. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the differential effects of cold and hot periods on IHD in Quebec health regions depending on age, sex, and other factors such as smoking, behaviour and deprivation levels.",M1
20143651,"Rupatadine and its effects on symptom control, stimulation time, and temperature thresholds in patients with acquired <e>cold</e> urticaria.BACKGROUND: Patients with acquired cold urticaria (ACU) show itchy wheals during cold exposure. This disturbing condition involves histamine and platelet-activating factor in its pathogenesis. Rupatadine is a dual antagonist of both histamine and platelet-activating factor. OBJECTIVE: To assess rupatadine efficacy in preventing reactions to cold challenge in patients with ACU. METHODS: A crossover, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 21 patients with ACU received rupatadine, 20 mg/d, or placebo for 1 week each is presented. The main outcome was the critical stimulation time threshold (CSTT) determined by ice cube challenge. Secondary outcomes included CSTT and the critical temperature threshold assessed by a cold provocation device (TempTest 3.0), as well as scores for wheal reactions, pruritus, burning sensations, and subjective complaints after cold challenge. RESULTS: After rupatadine treatment, 11 (52%) of 21 patients exhibited a complete response (ie, no urticaria lesions after ice cube provocation). A significant improvement in CSTT compared with placebo was observed after ice cube and TempTest 3.0 challenge (P = .03 and P = .004, respectively). A significant reduction of critical temperature threshold (P &lt; .001) and reduced scores for cold provocation-induced wheal reactions (P = .01), pruritus (P = .005), burning sensation (P = .03), and subjective complaints (P = .03) after rupatadine treatment were also found. Mild fatigue (n = 4), somnolence (n = 1), and moderate headache (n = 1) were reported during active treatment. CONCLUSION: Rupatadine, 20 mg/d, shows high efficacy and is well tolerated in the treatment of ACU symptoms.",M1
20143130,"Gene expression of DAM5 and DAM6 is suppressed by chilling temperatures and inversely correlated with bud break rate.We previously identified a cluster of d ormancy-a ssociated M ADS-box transcription factors (DAM genes) in peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] as potential candidates for control of the non-dormant phenotype observed in the evg mutant. Of these genes, DAM3, DAM5 and DAM6 were winter expressed, suggesting a role for these genes during endodormancy. We used peach cultivars with contrasting chilling requirements (CR) for bud break to observe the expression of DAM3, DAM5 and DAM6 in response to chilling accumulation in the field and controlled environments. Vegetative terminal and floral buds were sampled weekly from field grown 'Contender' (1050 h CR), 'Rubyprince' (850 h CR) and 'Springprince' (650 h CR) peach cultivars through winter 2008-2009. Flower and vegetative terminal bud break potential was evaluated at each sampling by forcing cuttings in a growth-permissive environment. We also measured vegetative terminal bud break and DAM gene expression in potted 'Contender' and 'Peen-To' (450 h CR) trees under controlled-environment <e>cold</e> exposure. DAM3, DAM5 and DAM6 are all suppressed by exposure to chilling temperatures in the field and in controlled conditions. Expression of DAM5 and DAM6 are higher in high chill cultivars prior to chilling accumulation and their expression level reaches a minimum in each cultivar coincident with acquisition of bud break competence. Expression levels of DAM5 and DAM6 in vegetative tips in controlled environment conditions were negatively correlated with the time required for bud break in forcing conditions. The expression patterns of DAM5 and DAM6 are consistent with a role as quantitative repressors of bud break.",M1
20141231,"The purple digit: an algorithmic approach to diagnosis.The acute onset of purple digits is a concerning manifestation and may represent underlying, potentially life-threatening disease. Correctly identifying the etiology of purple digits is essential to proper management, and can aid in the diagnosis of systemic disease. Multiple causes of purple digits and significant overlap in clinical presentation can make diagnosis difficult. Despite the various causes of acute purple digits in the published literature, an algorithmic approach to the evaluation and management of the most common and alarming etiologies has yet to be established. The initial step in evaluating a patient with purple digits is to determine if the cause is associated with hypoxemia or trauma. If the patient is in a stable condition, the dermatologist needs to determine if the process could be related to <e>cold</e> exposure such as Raynaud phenomenon, acrocyanosis, pernio, cryoglobulinemia or frostbite. If the disease occurs independent of temperature, physical examination and histological evaluation of the skin is recommended. The lack of peripheral pulses are concerning for acute arterial thrombosis from peripheral vascular disease or arterial embolism. Non-blanching skin changes on the digit that lack inflammation and microthrombosis most likely represent a bleeding or platelet abnormality; however, if microthrombi are identified a more life-threatening processes such as purpura fulminans or embolic phenomenon may be occurring. Evidence of blood vessel inflammation suggests a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient with a purple blanching digit and normal pulses requires an extensive historical review to help determine the cause. This review presents an algorithmic approach to assist in the evaluation and management of the purple digit.",M1

Orexin-containing neurons are located in structures 28, 29, 31 levels of brain slices and have the different degree of immunereactivity that indicates functional heterogeneity of a population of hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons. Structures and zones of hypothalamus involved in development of complex brain responses to restraint or cold stress applications were identified. Changes of immunereactivity of orexin-containing neurons located in the areas involved in system of regulation ofthermogenesis (DMH, PH and some zones LHA) suggest a possibility of orexin-containing neurons participation in thermoregulation.",M1

The efficiency of replication depends on a <e>cold</e> treatment of Drosophila embryos before the extract preparation and a formation of nuclei facilitated by the addition of membrane fractions to the extracts. In vitro DNA replication is ORC and CDC6 dependent, as a removal of these proteins from the extracts abolishes DNA replication. The N-terminal part of Orc1 protein, which is important for non-replicative functions of ORC, is dispensable for the replication in vitro. We also show that the conserved ATP ase motif of CDC6 is crucial for the replication. Our studies indicate that a Drosophila cell free system proves to be an extremely useful tool for a functional dissection of the processes and factors involved in DNA replication in metazoans.",M1
20138970,"Absence of morphine analgesia and its underlying descending serotonergic activation in an experimental mouse model of fibromyalgia.Mice exposed to intermittent <e>cold</e> stress (ICS), but not constant cold stress (CCS) showed sustained thermal hyperalgesia for up to 12 days. Systemic or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of morphine caused no significant analgesia in ICS mice, but induced dose-dependent analgesia in control mice. However, significant analgesic effects were achieved by intrathecal or intraplantar injection of morphine. The i.c.v. injection of morphine significantly increased the turnover ratio (5-HIAA/5-HT) in the dorsal half of the spinal cord of control mice, but not in ICS mice. Collectively, these results indicate that the loss of descending serotonergic activation seems to be a key mechanism underlying the absence of morphine-induced analgesia.",M1
20138846,"Spinal GABA receptors mediate the suppressive effect of electroacupuncture on <e>cold</e> allodynia in rats.This study was performed to determine whether spinal GABAergic systems mediate the relieving effects of low frequency electroacupuncture (EA) on cold allodynia in a rat tail model of neuropathic pain. For neuropathic surgery, the right superior caudal trunk was resected at the level between the S1 and S2 spinal nerves innervating the tail. Two weeks after the nerve injury, the intrathecal catheter was implanted. Five days after the catheterization, rats were intrathecally injected with gabazine (GABA(A) receptor antagonist, 0.0003, 0.001 or 0.003mug), or saclofen (GABA(B) receptor antagonist, 3, 10 or 30mug). Ten minutes after the injection, EA (2Hz) was applied to the ST36 acupoint for 30min. The cold allodynia was assessed by the tail immersion test (i.e. immersing the tail in cold (4 degrees C) water and measuring the latency of an abrupt tail movement) before and after the EA treatment. EA stimulation at ST36 significantly inhibited the cold allodynia sign, whereas EA at non-acupoint and plain acupuncture at ST36 (without electrical stimulation) did not show antiallodynic effects. Intrathecal administration of gabazine or saclofen blocked the relieving effects of ST36 EA stimulation on cold allodynia. These results suggest that spinal GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors mediate the suppressive effect of low frequency EA on cold allodynia in the tail neuropathic rats.",M1
20137820,"Molecular analysis of bacterial population structure and dynamics during <e>cold</e> storage of untreated and treated milk.Spoilage bacteria in milk are controlled by treatments such as thermization, microfiltration and addition of carbon dioxide. However, little information is known about the changes in microbial communities during subsequent cold storage of treated milk. Culture-dependent methods and a direct molecular approach combining 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) were applied to obtain a better overview of the structure and the dynamics of milk microbiota. Raw milk samples were treated by the addition of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), thermization (TH) or microfiltration (MF) and stored at 4 degrees C or 8 degrees C up to 7d. Untreated milk (UT) was used as a control. Psychrotrophic and staphylococci bacteria were enumerated in the milk samples by culture methods. For the molecular approach, DNA was extracted from milk samples and 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR with universal primers prior to cloning. The Q-PCR method was used to evaluate the dynamics of dominant bacterial species revealed by clone library analysis of 16S rRNA gene. Comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the two most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTU), determined at 97% identity, belonged to the class Gammaproteobacteria (40.3% of the 1415 sequences) and Bacilli (40%). Dominant bacterial species in UT, CO(2) and TH milk samples at day 3 were affiliated with Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Clostridia, Aerococcus, Facklamia, Corynebacterium, Acinetobacter and Trichococcus. Dominant bacterial species detected in MF milk were Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas and Delftia, while Pseudomonas species dominated the bacterial population of UT, CO(2) and MF milk samples at day 7. Staphylococcus and Delftia were the dominant bacterial species in thermized milk. Q-PCR results showed that populations of S. aureus, A. viridans, A. calcoaceticus, C. variabile and S. uberis were stable during 7d of storage at 4 degrees C. Populations of P. fluorescens, S. uberis and total bacteria increased in UT and CO(2) milk samples during 7d of storage at 8 degrees C and were noticeable from day 3. This study shows new microbial species which can develop during cold storage after milk treatment and contributes to identifying causes of reduced shelf life and deterioration of technological properties of milk during storage.",M1
20132866,"Dorsal root ganglion neurons respond with prolonged extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation following noxious heat and <e>cold</e> stimulation.In the present study the time course of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation (pERK1/2 appearance) in lumbar sensory dorsal root ganglia (DRG) was determined following a 5-min noxious heat or a noxious cold stimulus to the hind paw of the rat. The thermal stimuli were chosen to activate transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, but not to induce tissue damage. A quantitative analysis of phospho-ERK1/2 was performed by protein extraction and Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis showed that following the heat stimulus, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 increased 2-3-fold between 10 and 30min in the DRG on the ipsilateral side. High levels were maintained from 30min up to 16h. Following the cold stimulus to the paw, pERK1/2 immediately increased 2-fold within 2min in the DRG on the ipsilateral side, it declined within 2h and reached a second peak at 4h. In the DRGs on the contralateral side of the paw's heat or cold immersion the pERK1/2 remained low at all time points investigated. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry of the DRG following the thermal stimuli revealed an increased cytoplasmic staining for pERK1/2 in neurons. The present results show that following a 5-min nociceptive thermal stimulus sensory neurons respond with a characteristic long-lasting phosphorylation of ERK1/2.",M1
20132855,"Adrenomedullin in sinusoidal endothelial cells play protective roles against <e>cold</e> injury of liver.Donor organ damage caused by cold preservation is a major problem affecting liver transplantation. Cold preservation most easily damages liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and information about the molecules modulating LSECs function can provide the basis for new therapeutic strategies. Adrenomedullin (AM) is a peptide known to possess anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties. AM is abundant in vascular endothelial cells, but levels are comparatively low in liver, and little is known about its function there. In this study, we demonstrated both AM and its receptors are expressed in LSECs. AM treatment reduced LSECs loss and apoptosis under cold treatment. AM also downregulated cold-induced expression of TNFalpha, IL1beta, IL6, ICAM1 and VCAM1. AM reduced apoptosis and expression of ICAM1 and VCAM1 in an in vivo liver model subjected to cold storage. Conversely, apoptosis was exacerbated in livers from AM and RAMP2 (AM receptor activity-modifying protein) knockout mice. These results suggest that AM expressed in LSECs exerts a protective effect against cold-organ damage through modulation of apoptosis and inflammation.",M1
20132728,"Comparison of structure, function and regulation of plant <e>cold</e> shock domain proteins to bacterial and animal cold shock domain proteins.The cold shock domain (CSD) is among the most ancient and well conserved nucleic acid binding domains from bacteria to higher animals and plants. The CSD facilitates binding to RNA, ssDNA and dsDNA and most functions attributed to cold shock domain proteins are mediated by this nucleic acid binding activity. In prokaryotes, cold shock domain proteins only contain a single CSD and are termed cold shock proteins (Csps). In animal model systems, various auxiliary domains are present in addition to the CSD and are commonly named Y-box proteins. Similar to animal CSPs, plant CSPs contain auxiliary C-terminal domains in addition to their N-terminal CSD. Cold shock domain proteins have been shown to play important roles in development and stress adaptation in wide variety of organisms. In this review, the structure, function and regulation of plant CSPs are compared and contrasted to the characteristics of bacterial and animal CSPs. [BMB reports 2010; 43(1): 1-8].",M1
20131652,"Reliability of the measurement of stroke volume using impedance cardiography during acute <e>cold</e> exposure.INTRODUCTION: It is well documented that cardiovascular alterations occur during acute cold exposure (ACE). Interindividual variability is present, due mainly to body size differences, gender, and age. However, no study has evaluated stroke volume in the same individual twice in the same ambient conditions (i.e., test-retest reliability). Impedance cardiography (ICG) has become a popular method to acquire hemodynamic data in both clinical and applied physiology settings. Further, ICG does not interfere with other dependent variables such as oxygen consumption. Therefore, based on the uniqueness of the methodology, we sought to test reliability in this technology at 5 degrees C for 65 min on two separate occasions. METHODS: Nine young men underwent two 65-min trials of resting ACE, separated by at least 72 h. Volunteers were clothed in approximately one layer of clothing. Core and skin temperatures, oxygen consumption, and central hemodynamics were measured. RESULTS: As expected, core and skin temperature decreased while oxygen consumption showed a modest increase over time. In both trials, stroke volume significantly increased over time as heart rate decreased. There was similarity within subjects and between trials for all variables, as assessed via bivariate correlations. CONCLUSION: Cold increased stroke volume and decreased heart rate when subjects were pooled together, but each subject retained his individuality (minimal interindividual differences). Results suggest that impedance cardiography may be a reliable technique to use during acute cold exposure.",M1
20131326,"Gilthead sea bream liver proteome altered at low temperatures by oxidative stress.Gilthead sea bream exposed to the <e>cold</e> show multiple physiological alterations, particularly in liver. A typical cold-stress response was reproduced in gilthead sea bream acclimated to 20 degrees C (Warm group) when the water temperature was lowered to 8 degrees C (Cold group). After 10 days, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in the liver had increased by 50%, and nitric oxide had increased twofold. This indicates that lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress had occurred. Protein profiles of liver from fish in warm and cold environments were obtained by 2-DE. Quantification of differential expression by matching spots showed that a total of 57 proteins were altered significantly. Many proteins were downregulated following cold exposure, including actin, the most abundant protein in the proteome; enzymes of amino acid metabolism; and enzymes with antioxidant capacity, such as betaine-homocysteine-methyl transferase, glutathione-S-transferase and catalase. Some proteins associated with protective action were upregulated at low temperatures, including peroxiredoxin, thioredoxin and lysozyme; as well as enzymes such as aldehyde dehydrogenase and adenosin-methionine synthetase. However, the upregulation of proteases, proteasome activator protein and trypsinogen-like protein indicated an increase in proteolysis. Increases in elongation factor-1alpha, the GAPDH oxidative form, tubulin and Raf-kinase inhibitor protein indicated oxidative stress and the induction of apoptosis. These data indicate that cold exposure induced oxidative damage in hepatocytes.",M1

AIM: To assess the reproducibility of EBC pH for two commercially available devices (portable RTube and non-portable ECoScreen) in healthy controls, patients with asthma or COPD, and subjects suffering from an acute <e>cold</e> with lower-airway symptoms. In addition, we assessed the repeatability in healthy controls. METHODS: EBC was collected from 40 subjects (n = 10 in each of the above groups) using RTube and ECoScreen. EBC was collected from controls on two separate occasions within 5 days. pH in EBC was assessed after degasification with argon for 20 min. RESULTS: In controls, pH-measurements in EBC collected by RTube or ECoScreen showed no significant difference between devices (p = 0.754) or between days (repeatability coefficient RTube: 0.47; ECoScreen: 0.42) of collection. A comparison between EBC pH collected by the two devices in asthma, COPD and cold patients also showed good reproducibility. No differences in pH values were observed between controls (mean pH 8.27; RTube) and patients with COPD (pH 7.97) or asthma (pH 8.20), but lower values were found using both devices in patients with a cold (pH 7.56; RTube, p &lt; 0.01; ECoScreen, p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that pH measurements in EBC collected by RTube and ECoScreen are repeatable and reproducible in healthy controls, and are reproducible and comparable in healthy controls, COPD and asthma patients, and subjects with a common cold.",M2
19419546,"ICE <e>COLD</e> ERIC--International collaborative effort on chronic obstructive lung disease: exacerbation risk index cohorts--study protocol for an international COPD cohort study.BACKGROUND: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a systemic disease; morbidity and mortality due to COPD are on the increase, and it has great impact on patients' lives. Most COPD patients are managed by general practitioners (GP). Too often, GPs base their initial assessment of patient's disease severity mainly on lung function. However, lung function correlates poorly with COPD-specific health-related quality of life and exacerbation frequency. A validated COPD disease risk index that better represents the clinical manifestations of COPD and is feasible in primary care seems to be useful. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a practical COPD disease risk index that predicts the clinical course of COPD in primary care patients with GOLD stages 2-4. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct 2 linked prospective cohort studies with COPD patients from GPs in Switzerland and the Netherlands. We will perform a baseline assessment including detailed patient history, questionnaires, lung function, history of exacerbations, measurement of exercise capacity and blood sampling. During the follow-up of at least 2 years, we will update the patients' profile by registering exacerbations, health-related quality of life and any changes in the use of medication. The primary outcome will be health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes will be exacerbation frequency and mortality. Using multivariable regression analysis, we will identify the best combination of variables predicting these outcomes over one and two years and, depending on funding, even more years. DISCUSSION: Despite the diversity of clinical manifestations and available treatments, assessment and management today do not reflect the multifaceted character of the disease. This is in contrast to preventive cardiology where, nowadays, the treatment in primary care is based on patient-specific and fairly refined cardiovascular risk profile corresponding to differences in prognosis. After completion of this study, we will have a practical COPD-disease risk index that predicts the clinical course of COPD in primary care patients with GOLD stages 2-4. In a second step we will incorporate evidence-based treatment effects into this model, such that the instrument may guide physicians in selecting treatment based on the individual patients' prognosis.

19328957,"Dramatic improvement in survival after lung transplantation over time: a single center experience.Lung transplantation (LT) is a recognized procedure for selected patients with end-stage respiratory failure. We performed 123 LT, including 32 single lung, 84 double lung, and 7 heart-lung transplantations in 48 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 13 patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH), 33 with cystic fibrosis (CF), and 29 with interstitial lung disease (ILD) between July 1990 and January 2008. Survival was compared for periods before and after December 2001. The mean age of patients was 44.4 years (range 16-66.5 years); 84 (69%) were men. Before LT, 1 second forced expiratory volume was 28.7% +/- 18.1% and PaCO(2) = 6.3 kPa. Fifty-five patients were on noninvasive ventilation. <e>Cold</e> ischemia time was 320 +/- 91 minutes. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was used in 77 patients (64%). There were 18 early surgical reinterventions, 8 extracorporeal membrane oxygenations, and 38 bronchial stent insertions among 206 at-risk bronchial sutures. Crude survivals were 69%, 58%, 41%, and 18% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Comparing before (n = 70 with 15 CF) vs after December 2001 (n = 53 with 17 CF), survivals were 63% vs 78%, 51% vs 71%, and 33% vs 60% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively (P = .01) and for CF patients, 52% vs 100%, 52% vs 94%, and 25% vs 94% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively (P = .005). There was significant improvement in survival before and after 2001 in 123 LT and particularly among CF patients. Improvement in survival after LT may be related to the sum of numerous changes in our practice since December 2001, including the use of pulmonary rehabilitation pre-LT, extracellular pneumoplegia, statins, macrolides for chronic rejection, monitoring of Epstein-Barr blood load, changes in maintenance immunosuppressants, as well as position movement up the coordinator nurse and learning curve.",M2
19307387,"Evaluation of a method for converting venous values of acid-base and oxygenation status to arterial values.OBJECTIVE: This paper evaluates a method in which arterial values of pH, carbon dioxide tension (Pco(2)) and oxygen tension (Po(2)) calculated from venous values and pulse oximetry are compared with simultaneously measured arterial values. METHODS: 103 adult patients from three departments (pulmonary medicine, thoracic intensive care and multidisciplinary intensive care) were studied. The patients belonged to three groups: (1) 31 haemodynamically stable patients with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive lung disease (<e>COLD</e>); (2) 49 haemodynamically stable patients without COLD; and (3) 23 haemodynamically unstable patients without COLD. Arterial and venous (peripheral and, where possible, central and mixed) blood samples were taken simultaneously and anaerobically. Peripheral arterial oxygen saturation was measured with a pulse oximeter. The principle of the method is to simulate the transport of venous blood back through the tissues using the respiratory quotient (adding oxygen and removing carbon dioxide) until simulated arterial oxygenation matches that measured by pulse oximetry. RESULTS: Calculated values of arterial pH and Pco(2) had very small bias and standard deviations regardless of the venous sampling site. In all cases these errors were within those considered acceptable for the performance of laboratory equipment, and well within the limits of error acceptable in clinical practice. In addition, the standard deviation (SD) of calculated values of pH and Pco(2) was similar to the variability between consecutive arterial samples. For peripheral oxygen saturation values &lt; or =96%, the method can calculate Po(2) with an SD of 0.93, which may be useful in clinical practice. Calculations made from peripheral venous blood were significantly more accurate than those from central venous blood. CONCLUSION: Arterial pH and Pco(2) can be calculated precisely from peripheral venous blood in a broad patient population. The method has potential for use as a screening tool in emergency medical departments and in medical and surgical wards to assess a patient's acid-base and oxygenation status prior to sampling arterial blood or to help in the decision to refer the patient to the ICU. In departments where arterial blood gas values are used to monitor patients (eg, pulmonary medicine), the method might reduce the number of arterial samples taken by replacing them with peripheral venous blood samples, thus reducing the need for painful arterial punctures.",M2

COLD was diagnosed in 346 patients (group 1), COLD and CHD in 402 (group 2), CHD in 211 (group 3). The methods included X-ray studies (survey and excretory urography), functional diagnostics (ECG, Doppler cardiography, assessment of external respiration, abdominal, renal, and bladder ultrasound, measurements of residual urine, transrectal and transabdominal examination of prostate). The glomerular filtration rate was estimated using Cockcrofft-Gault and MDRD formulas and Rerberg- Tareev method, renal hemodynamics by duplex scanning of renal arteries. Inflammatory urogenital diseases were most frequently diagnosed in group 2 (chronic cystitis 83.8%, chronic pyelonephritis 73.9%). Diabetic nephropathy common in this group (25.4%) was related to the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in these patients (37.8%) compared with 26.3 and 29.9% in groups 1 and 3 respectively. Ischemic renal disease occurred in every tenth patient of group 2 or much more frequently than in groups 1 and 3. This suggests additive COLD and CHD effect on the atherosclerotic process. The combination of these diseases was responsible for a large fraction of patients with chronic renal insufficiency in group 2 (45%). It is concluded that concomitant urogenital pathology in patients with COLD results in mutual aggravation of the clinical course of the two diseases and requires additional examination and obligatory medicamentous correction.",M2
19020202,"Identification and management of severe respiratory syncytial virus.PURPOSE: Identifying children at risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) so that the most appropriate management strategies can be implemented, thereby reducing the morbidity associated with this disease, is discussed. SUMMARY: RSV infection is associated with a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild <e>cold</e>-like symptoms to more severe disease. The majority of infants infected with RSV develop mild upper respiratory tract disease during their initial RSV infection. However, more severe RSV disease can occur when the lower respiratory tract becomes involved, with symptoms escalating to include significant wheezing and chest-wall retractions, as well as cyanosis and tachypnea in the most severe cases. Extrapulmonary manifestations of RSV disease also have been observed, such as sepsis-like syndrome and arrhythmias. Factors that increase the risk of acquiring RSV infection have been identified, along with factors that increase the risk of severe RSV disease. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that clinicians assess risk factors for severe disease when making decisions regarding evaluation and management of children with bronchiolitis. There is currently no curative treatment for RSV infection, and management primarily involves the treatment of specific symptoms. The AAP developed clinical practice guidelines to provide an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis in children aged one month to two years, with detailed recommendations on which therapies are appropriate for children with more severe RSV disease. CONCLUSION: The AAP developed specific guidelines for the management of RSV bronchiolitis; however, treatment is primarily supportive and has been shown to be suboptimal in many patients. Because of the limitations associated with the management of RSV disease, prevention remains of paramount importance, especially in patients at high risk for severe disease.",M2

18331572,"Specific nasal symptoms and symptom-provoking factors may predict increased risk of developing COPD.In a 1992 questionnaire study, we found that certain nasal symptoms and symptom-provoking factors were associated with prevalence of self-reported chronic bronchitis/emphysema (CBE). In this follow-up study, we examined whether any nasal features could predict an increased incidence of self-reported physician's diagnosis of CBE/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In 2000, a survey was performed similar to the one in 1992. Of a paired follow-up group of 4933 participants aged 28-67 years, 4280 (86.8%) returned the questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) for cumulative incidence (between 1992 and 2000) of self-reported physician-diagnosed CBE/COPD and asthma, respectively, were calculated by logistic regression with adjustment for age, gender and smoking habits. Reports of thick, yellow nasal discharge and nasal blockage in 1992 predicted incidence of CBE/COPD: OR 2.3 (1.2-4.2) and 1.8 (1.1-2.8) respectively. Moreover, nasal symptoms provoked by exposure to damp/<e>cold</e> air and tobacco smoke predicted CBE/COPD: OR 3.4 (1.9-6.0) and 2.5 (1.4-4.2). Nasal itching and nasal symptoms provoked by exposure to grass pollen and furred animals predicted incidence of asthma. These results suggest that certain nasal symptoms and nasal symptom-provoking exposures, different from those commonly associated with asthma, may predict increased risk of developing CBE/COPD. This supports the possibility of nasal co-morbidity in COPD.",M2
18303415,"Viral infections in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is increasing evidence that implicates viral infections as a major risk factor for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recent studies have attempted to better characterize the epidemiology of viral infections in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, identify unique clinical manifestations of virus-associated exacerbations, and develop new diagnostic tools and treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: Rhinovirus, the organism most often responsible for causing the common <e>cold</e>, is also the most common infectious cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. Coronavirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and metapneumovirus are other important viral causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. These exacerbations can be severe with prolonged recovery times. Although PCR technology has dramatically increased the detection rate of viruses in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it does not differentiate infection from colonization. The use of biomarkers represents an exciting new potential diagnostic tool that may lend new insights into the pathogenesis of viral infections in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. SUMMARY: Despite strong epidemiologic evidence linking respiratory virus infection to exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, many of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which viruses cause exacerbations remain undetermined. Future research efforts to understand these mechanisms would aid the development of novel therapeutics to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this disease.",M2

METHODS: COPD model was established by modified method of combining fumigation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intra-tracheal dripping. Model rats were treated respectively for succesive 14 days according to their syndrome, that is, Xiaoqinglong Decoction to the rats of <e>cold</e>-phlegm accumulation in Fei, Maxing Shigan Decoction to those of heat-phlegm accumulation in Fei, Yupingfeng Decoction to those of Fei-qi deficiency, Liujunzi Decoction to those of Pi-qi deficiency, Renshen Gejie Decoction to those of Shen qi-deficiency. Besides, model rats in the model control group received 2mL normal saline daily, and no intervention was applied in the normal control group. The expression of gamma-GCS and NF-kappaB was detected by immunochemistry before and after treatment. RESULTS: Compared with that in the normal rats, the expressions of gamma-GCS and NF-kappaB in bronchial and alveolar epithelium of COPD rats before treatment were significantly higher, but the positive expression rates were lowered after treatment significantly (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: TCM treatment according to syndrome differentiation could rectify imbalance of oxidation/anti-oxidation and alleviate inflammatory reaction in COPD rats, thus to treat COPD effectively.",M2
17515249,"<e>Cold</e> air-provoked respiratory symptoms: the mechanisms and management.OBJECTIVES: To describe the mechanisms and management of cold air-provoked respiratory symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A literature review. METHODS: The review includes human epidemiological studies, human and animal experimental studies, as well as human studies about management of the cold air-provoked respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: Cold air is unlikely to be a causal factor initiating respiratory diseases but a symptom trigger. In the present review, the airway responses beyond these symptoms were divided into three types. The short-term responses are those that develop within minutes in response to sudden cooling of the airways. Subjects with asthma or rhinitis are especially prone to these responses. The long-term responses are those that develop in response to repeated and long-standing cooling and drying of the airways, usually in endurance athletes. Finally, there are the physiological, reflex-mediated lower-airway responses to cooling of the skin or upper airways. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanisms beyond cold air-provoked respiratory symptoms vary considerably and mainly depend on the individual's susceptibility and the ventilation level during the cold exposure. An understanding of these mechanisms is essential for successful management of the symptoms.",M2

The studies point to the development of significant mucociliary insufficiency that deteriorates the signs of bronchial obstruction in patients with COLD with pesticide accumulation. With the longer release of an inhaled indicator (MCT time &gt; 48 hours), peak forced expiratory flow rates (PFEFR) were found to considerably decrease in this category of patients than in patients without impaired MCT (PEFR 1.8 +/- 0.6 l/sec versus 5.9 +/- 0.3 l/sec.

17311838,"Temporal relationship between air pollutants and hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Hong Kong.AIMS: To assess any relationship between the levels of ambient air pollutants and hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Hong Kong. METHODS: A retrospective ecological study was undertaken. Data of daily emergency hospital admissions to 15 major hospitals in Hong Kong for COPD and indices of air pollutants (sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)), particulates with an aerodynamic diameter of &lt;10 microm (PM(10)) and 2.5 microm (PM(2.5))) and meteorological variables from January 2000 to December 2004 were obtained from several government departments. Analysis was performed using generalised additive models with Poisson distribution, adjusted for the effects of time trend, season, other cyclical factors, temperature and humidity. Autocorrelation and overdispersion were corrected. RESULTS: Significant associations were found between hospital admissions for COPD with all five air pollutants. Relative risks for admission for every 10 microg/m(3) increase in SO(2), NO(2), O(3), PM(10) and PM(2.5) were 1.007, 1.026, 1.034, 1.024 and 1.031, respectively, at a lag day ranging from lag 0 to cumulative lag 0-5. In a multipollutant model, O(3), SO(2) and PM(2.5) were significantly associated with increased admissions for COPD. SO(2), NO(2) and O(3) had a greater effect on COPD admissions in the <e>cold</e> season (December to March) than during the warm season. CONCLUSION: Ambient concentrations of air pollutants have an adverse effect on hospital admissions for COPD in Hong Kong, especially during the winter season. This might be due to indoor exposure to outdoor pollution through open windows as central heating is not required in the mild winter. Measures to improve air quality are urgently needed.",M2
17306748,"Health needs of patients with chronic diseases who lived through the great Hanshin earthquake.OBJECTIVE: To identify the health needs of patients with chronic diseases who lived through the great Hanshin earthquake of 1995. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with rheumatism, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease were enrolled in the study. Semi-structured interviews were performed by the authors in 2004. RESULTS: Priorities for patients with all three diseases were securing medications and ensuring that they were able to take their medications. Rheumatism patients required methods of preventing their bodies from becoming <e>cold</e>, fatigued, and stressed in order to prevent aggravation of their disease; they also wanted relief workers to understand the physical limitations they experience. The health needs of diabetic patients included receiving an appropriate diet and developing ways to cope with the stress caused by the change in living environment. Patients with chronic respiratory diseases reported that their health needs included developing methods to prevent their bodies from becoming cold, fatigued, and stressed in order to prevent aggravation of their disease, access to respiratory masks to minimize dust and cold air exposure, and guidance in methods to alleviate respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The emergency preparedness planning and care priorities for individuals with chronic health problems, such as rheumatism, diabetes, and pulmonary disease, should include attention to medication availability, stress management, support for activities of daily living, appropriate food, and availability of support devices necessary to minimize exacerbation of symptoms.",M2
17128793,"[The clinical and functional features of chronic obstructive lung disease in patients with organic chlorine pesticides in blood]Impact of pollutant human aggression is of great importance for the development of bronchopulmonary diseases.

Eighty-two patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (<e>COLD</e>) were studied in relation to the presence of blood chlorine- and phosphorus-containing pesticides. The latter were tested for their effect on the course of COLD. There was evidence that the higher blood levels of pesticides were, the more severe the clinical symptoms of the process and the more pronounced changes in the functional status of the bronchopulmonary apparatus were. The findings suggest that the blood content of organic chlorine pesticides affects the course of COLD. These compounds cause more significant clinical and functional impairments with the severe manifestations of mucous membrane morphofunctional rearrangement and with disruption of the body's adaptive potentials. These patients poorly respond to therapy, which required dose adjustment and longer drug use.",M2
17059998,"Risks and outcomes of acute kidney injury requiring dialysis after cardiac transplantation.BACKGROUND: Risk factors for postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) are well described in nontransplantation settings. Data regarding risks and consequences of AKI after cardiac transplantation are unclear. METHODS: We analyzed 756 cardiac transplant recipients between 1993 and 2004. The primary outcome is postoperative AKI requiring dialysis therapy. Secondary outcomes are hospital mortality and postoperative morbidities, including cardiac, neurological, and serious infection. Wilcoxon rank-sum, chi-square, or Fisher exact tests were used for univariable comparison. A bootstrap-bagging procedure (1,000 repetitions) and multivariable logistic analysis with multiple imputation were used for the final model. RESULTS: AKI frequency was 5.8% (44 of 756 patients). By means of univariable analysis, preoperative risk factors for AKI were diabetes, prior cardiac surgery, intra-aortic balloon pump use, albumin level, creatinine level, clinical severity score, and <e>cold</e> ischemia time. Intraoperative risk factors were cardiopulmonary bypass time and transfusion requirement. By means of multivariate analysis, serum creatinine level (odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6 to 4.6), serum albumin level (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.54), insulin-requiring diabetes (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 9.0), and cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.64) were independent predictors of postoperative AKI. The overall postoperative mortality rate was 4.2%; it was 50% in patients with AKI compared with 1.4% in patients without AKI. AKI was associated with greater frequencies of cardiac, neurological, and serious infection morbidities (43.2%, 18.2%, and 54.6% versus 5.5%, 2.3%, and 7.2%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001).

Predictors of AKI can be used to risk-stratify patients to ameliorate further kidney injury and offer a survival benefit.",M2
17036089,"Perspectives that influence action plans for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.BACKGROUND: Prompt treatment of acute exacerbations (AEs) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) improves quality of life and reduces the use of health care resources. Although patient self-management through an individualized action plan (AP) can help with early initiation of therapy, its use is critically dependent on the patient recognizing the features of an exacerbation. OBJECTIVE: To describe COPD patients' experiences with AEs, as well as health care professionals' (HCPs') attitudes toward the provision of an AP as part of self-management education. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with moderate to severe COPD who recently experienced at least one AE, and 22 HCPs with experience in the management of COPD, were interviewed. RESULTS: The most common symptoms and signs associated with an AE were difficulty breathing (84%), fatigue (81%), <e>cold</e> symptoms (59%), changes in sputum colour (53%) or amount (47%), and cough (44%). The main precipitants identified were environmental triggers (47%), infective agents (31%), excessive activities (25%), emotional factors (16%) and changes in medications (9%). Strategies for dyspnea relief included increasing medications (72%), resting (56%), avoiding exposure to environmental triggers (41%) and performing breathing exercises (31%). Patients supported the use of an AP and recommended that it be individualized for symptoms and triggers, and that it should also include strategies for addressing anxiety and depression. HCPs also supported the use of an individualized AP and recommended that it be regularly revisited, depending on the patient's disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' experiences with AEs do not always conform to a standard medical definition. Therefore, an understanding of their experience is of value in the design of an individualized AP. HCPs support the use of an AP that emphasizes self-management of exacerbations as well as general COPD management.",M2
17035445,"Impact of a winter respiratory virus season on patients with COPD and association with influenza vaccination.BACKGROUND: We assessed the effects of an influenza season on patients with COPD. Data from 2,215 veterans in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind influenza vaccine efficacy study were analyzed for changes in spirometric and functional status, comparing patients with laboratory-documented influenza (LDI)-caused illness, non-LDI-caused respiratory illness, or no illness, and for association with influenza vaccination. METHODS: Patients received either IM trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (TIV) plus intranasal trivalent, live attenuated, <e>cold</e>-adapted influenza virus vaccine (TC) or TIV plus intranasal placebo (TP). We performed spirometry, measured the chronic lung disease severity index (CLDSI) score to assess functional status and well-being, and tested for influenza virus infection. RESULTS: Worsening in FEV(1), percentage of predicted FEV(1), and CLDSI score (p &lt; 0.001) was associated with acute respiratory illness in 585 illnesses including 94 LDI-caused illnesses. LDI-caused illness was more likely to be associated with worsening in FEV(1) and CLDSI score acutely than non-LDI-caused illness (p &lt; 0.01). Logistic regression showed acute respiratory illness (odds ratio [OR], 1.78; 95% confidence limit [CL], 1.40 to 2.26) to be associated with worsening in CLDSI score, and receipt of TC (OR, 1.39; 95% CL, 1.10 to 1.74) and no illness (OR, 0.70; 95% CL, 0.53 to 0.91 for acute respiratory illness) to be associated with better CLDSI score at the end of the study. Hospitalization was more frequent in patients with acute respiratory illness (p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Acute respiratory illness was associated with increased health-care utilization and obstruction to airflow, and worse functional status and well-being. At the end of the study, receipt of TC was associated with improvement and acute respiratory illness was associated with worsening in functional status and well-being.",M2

Comparison of the clinical efficacy of Clerimed with beta-lactams and respiratory fluoroquinolones has indicated the equal clinical efficacy of the compared groups of drugs. A functional and laboratory monitoring of patients with an exacerbation of COLD treated with Clerimed has established that the most pronounced changes (improvement) occur within the first week of antibiotic therapy, which is typical of control patients. The side effects of Clerimed have been found to occur not more frequently than those of other antibiotics and they are considered to be slight. Clarythromycin may be recommended for the starting therapy of exacerbations of COLD in everyday practice.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients aged 40 to 56 years (mean 45.0 +/- 2.0 years) who had COLD and CCP were examined. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded by M- and B-mode and Doppler echocardiographies. RESULTS: Addition of perindopil to course therapy in patients with COLD and CCP ameliorated pulmonary hypertension, positively affected central and peripheral hemodynanic parameters, and failed to have a negative impact on external respiratory function and renal and hepatic function. The long-term use of perindopril in individually adjusted doses in the outpatient setting showed pronounced beneficial clinical effects and considerably improved the morphofunctional parameters of the right cardiac cavities and patients' life quality. CONCLUSION: It is advisable to include the ACE inhibitor perindopril into complex therapy in patients with CCP in order to correct pulmonary and central hemodynamic disorders.",M2
16636095,"Prevention of exacerbations: how are we doing and can we do better?Prevention of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can involve removing the cause or reducing the patient's vulnerability to the cause. This article addresses the following issues: What is the problem during an exacerbation, what are the causes of an exacerbation, what can prevent exacerbations, and who are we? The difference between a patient with COPD during an exacerbation and after recovery is small. It is unlikely that patients with early COPD experience less exposure to exacerbation causes than those with severe disease; it is just that the consequences are more severe for those with severe disease. Interventions that produce small absolute benefits can therefore have a disproportionately large effect on exacerbation reduction. Recognized causes include season, <e>cold</e> weather, pollution events, bacterial infection, viral infection, and treatment withdrawal. Countries with warmer climates have much larger mortality in cold weather than those with colder climates. Reducing exacerbations in more temperate climates may be altered as much by changes in clothing and bedroom heating as by changes in treatment. Taking more exercise in cold weather may be the underlying reason for the reduction of exacerbations after pulmonary rehabilitation. Influenza vaccination reduces influenza severity and reduces transmission from health care workers to patients. There are a number of pharmacologic interventions shown to reduce (the effect of) exacerbations, including inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, long-acting anticholinergics, mucolytics, and perhaps antibiotics that reduce Haemophilus carriage. The effect of the bronchodilators is additive to inhaled corticosteroids; how far the other interventions are complementary is unclear. So far, we have had a very medical response to COPD exacerbations. Altering social and behavioral aspects is likely to be complementary.",M2
16610311,"[Evaluation of the course of chronic obstructive lung diseases according to the classifications of the European Respiratory Society and the Global Initiative on Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease]In 91 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (<e>COLD</e>), the severity of this disease according to the Classifications of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the Global Initiative on Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) was compared with that of pulmonary dysfunction according to the data of a comprehensive study, involving the determination of bronchial patency, lung volumes, capacities, and gas-exchange function. This follows that the ERS and GOLD classifications are to be positively appraised as they provide an eligible group of patients for clinical practice in terms of the severity of pulmonary dysfunction and that of COLD. However, the concomitant clinical use of both classifications cannot be regarded as justifiable due to that there are differences in the number of detectable grades (stages) of COLD and borderline (COLD differentiating grades (stages) values of EFV1). In this connection, both classifications have approximately equally significant merits and shortcomings and it is practically impossible to give preference to one of them as the best one. The optimal way out of the established situation is to develop a new (improved) classification of the severity of COLD on the bases of these two existing classifications.",M2
16463247,"[Airway sensory nerve and tachykinins in asthma and COPD]The airway nerve has gained importance in the field of respiratory research as it is known to have the capacity to release numerous mediators which can cause pulmonary effects in the airways. Meanwhile, a broad range of stimuli including capsaicin, bradykinin, hyperosmolar saline, tobacco smoke, allergens, ozone, inflammatory mediators and <e>cold</e> dry air have been shown to activate sensory nerve fibres to release neuropeptides such as the tachykinins substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA) to mediate neurogenic inflammation. SP is synthesized in cell bodies of airway neurons of the trigeminal, jugulare and nodose ganglia. Following their release, tachykinins are degraded by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme. Tachykinins have been proposed to play an important role in human respiratory diseases such as bronchial asthma und chronic obstructive diseases (COPD) as they have been shown to have potent effects on the tone of airway smooth muscle, airway secretions, bronchial circulation and on inflammatory and immune cells by activation of the neurokinin-1 (NK-1) and neurokinin-2 (NK-2) receptors. Recently, new tachykinins such as virokinin and hemokinin were identified and characterised. Different aspects of the neurogenic inflammation have been well studied in animal models of allergic airway inflammation, but only little is known about the role of neurogenic airway inflammation in human diseases. To address the precise role of tachykinins and airway sensory nerves in human asthma und COPD, experiments on sensory nerve sensitisation and neuro-immune interaction have to be carried out in future studies.",M2
16330875,"Symptom-based questionnaire for identifying COPD in smokers.BACKGROUND: Symptom-based questionnaires may enhance chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) screening in primary care. OBJECTIVES: We prospectively tested questions to help identify COPD among smokers without prior history of lung disease. METHODS: Subjects were recruited via random mailing to primary care practices in Aberdeen, UK, and Denver, Colo., USA. Current and former smokers aged 40 or older with no prior respiratory diagnosis and no respiratory medications in the past year were enrolled. Participants answered questions covering demographics and symptoms and then underwent spirometry with reversibility testing. A study diagnosis of COPD was defined as fixed airway obstruction as measured by post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC &lt;0.70. We examined the ability of individual questions in a multivariate framework to correctly discriminate between persons with and without COPD. RESULTS: 818 subjects completed all investigations and proceeded to analysis. The list of 54 questions yielded 52 items for analysis, which was reduced to 17 items for entry into multivariate regression. Eight items had significant relationships with the study diagnosis of COPD, including age, pack-years, body mass index, weather-affected cough, phlegm without a <e>cold</e>, morning phlegm, wheeze frequency, and history of any allergies. Individual items yielded odds ratios ranging from 0.23 to 12. This questionnaire demonstrated a sensitivity of 80.4 and specificity of 72.0.

Symptom-based questionnaires could identify persons likely to need spirometry. OBJECTIVES: We prospectively tested questions derived from a comprehensive literature review and an international Delphi panel to help identify chronic OLD (COPD) in persons with prior evidence of OLD. METHODS: Subjects were recruited via random mailing to primary-care practices in Aberdeen, Scotland, and Denver, Colorado. Persons aged 40 and older reporting any prior diagnosis of OLD or any respiratory medications in the past year were enrolled. Participants answered 54 questions covering demographics and symptoms and underwent spirometry with reversibility testing. A study diagnosis of COPD was defined by fixed airway obstruction as measured by post-bronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC &lt;0.70.

16319329,"Effects of exacerbations and seasonality on exhaled nitric oxide in COPD.Exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) appears to be associated with airway inflammation seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The present authors studied the effects of exacerbation, season, temperature and pollution on eNO. eNO was measured seasonally and at exacerbations in 79 outpatients suffering from COPD (mean forced expiratory volume in one second=42%). The effects of exacerbation symptoms, physiological and environmental parameters were analysed. Stable eNO levels were correlated positively with arterial oxygen tension. Median levels were found to be lower in smokers (5.3 ppb) than in ex- or nonsmokers (6.8 ppb). Levels were higher during October to December (6.9 ppb) than in April to June (4.6 ppb). Levels were also higher during 68 exacerbations in 38 patients (7.4 ppb) than in stable conditions (5.4 ppb), independent of the effects of smoking. The rise in eNO was greater in exacerbations that were associated with <e>colds</e>, a sore throat or dyspnoea combined with a cold. In conclusion, exhaled nitric oxide levels were higher in colder weather and in the autumn, perhaps related to the increased prevalence of viral infection at this time of year. The levels were lower in more severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Exhaled nitric oxide levels were raised at the onset of exacerbation, particularly in the presence of a cold.",M2

Before and after tests using salbutamol, phenoterol, ipratropium bromide and a fixed combination of phenoterol and ipratropium bromide, the forced expiratory flow-volume curve was recorded in the patients on each visit (1008 and 1398 visits of patients with BA and COLD, respectively). The study was controlled open-labeled, and prospective. All the bronchodilators were found to be effective in both BA and COLD. However, in asthmatic patients without (less than 4%) and with (more than 5%) eosinophilia, the increase in forced expiratory volume per second (FEV1) was 23.7+/-22.1% and 16.0+/-14.6% of the baseline values, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Among these patients with ESR of less than 100 mm/hour, the increase in FEV1 was significantly higher--21.7+/-19.7% than in those who had ERS more than 15 mm/hour and this was 13.8+/-17.9% of the baseline values (p &lt; 0.05). Among asthmatic patients, more than 15% increases in FEV1 after administration of bronchodilators were noted in 48% of the patients untreated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and in 61% of the ICS-treated patients (chi2 = 6.55; d.f. = 1; p = 0.01). Among ICS-treated and untreated patients with BA, the mean increase in FEV1 was 24.4+/-22.5% and 19.6+/-22.0% of the baseline values, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). In COLD patients, these differences were absent.

The two stages of the study included 3-weak treatment during exacerbation periods and a 3-month outpatient follow-up during clinical remission periods. Erespal was administered twice a day in a total dose of 160 mg/day. The study included evaluation of clinical symptoms, respiratory function, bronchoscopic data, laboratory indices of inflammation, antioxydative status, life quality (LQ), as well as cytological and cytochemical analysis of induced sputum (IS). During exacerbation periods of COLD the researchers observed early and noticeable antitussive and mucolytic action of erespal, which were associated with lessening of bronchial obstruction and inflammation, significant fall of C-reactive protein level, cytosis in IS, proportion of neutrophiles (p &lt; 0.01), elevation of lysosomal cation proteins in neutrophiles (p &lt; 0.01), increase of total oxidant serum level (in 46.2% of the patients vs. 26.3% of the patients in the conventional therapy group). Long term (3 months) treatment with erespal led to further positive dynamics of clinical and laboratory indices of inflammation, and improved the results of cytological and cytochemical study of IS. The results of the study demonstrate that inclusion of erespal in complex therapy of COLD increases efficacy of treatment, due to its anti-inflammatory action during the periods of exacerbation and relative remission, prevents augmenting of bronchial obstruction, and improves patients' LQ.",M2

The GOLD guide lines of the medical therapy of the COPD are showed. The spa therapy of COPD is based on the inhalation use of mineral water, mainly sulphurous and salsojodic. Sulphurous mineral waters have vasodilating activity on vessels of bronchial mucose, improving its trophic state, and increase the production of secretory IgA and muco-ciliary clearance; they have fluidificant activity on bronchial secretion. Clinical trials showed improvement of cough, sputum and functional indexes as FEV1 and CV. Salsojodic mineral waters increase the fluidity of the bronchial mucus, muco-ciliary clearance and the trophism of the bronchial mucose.

Certain data suggest that COLD increase the risk of the development of cardiovascular pathology 2 to 3 times. The purpose of the study was to establish coronary heart disease (CHD) rate among patients with COLD, and to determine the peculiarities of CHD in this category of patients. The subjects were 116 patients with COLD (mean age 53.5 +/- 1.13 years). The authors also analyzed lethality in the Pulmonary division of the clinic, where 41 patients had died in 1998-2003. CHD was diagnosed in 31 (26.7%) patients. The results show that CHD rate in COLD patients older than 60 is 1.5 times higher than that in those younger than 60, and 2.3 times higher than that in those younger than 50. The patients with and without CHD demonstrate significant difference in the severity of COLD and obstructive syndrome. The leading cause of death in COLD patients was respiratory and circulatory failure; also noticed was high myocardial infarction rate among those patients. Autopsies revealed signs of coronary artery atherosclerosis in 7 out of 9 patients. The obtained data suggest that CHD development is a regular phenomenon in COLD patients, especially in those exposed to other CHD risk factors. The risk group consists of patients with severe COLD; their examination requires special attention paid to possible CHD symptoms and painless myocardial ischemia, for early diagnostics and beginning of antianginal therapy.",M2

METHODS: Retrospective study, including 659 patients with primary SP and SP associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), conservatively treated in a 5-year period. In the analyzed period, 548 days with SP were compared both with 3 days preceding the onset of SP and with days without pneumothorax. The comparison was made depending on weather phases and on different aspects of AP and T. RESULTS: Seasons of the year did not significantly influence the occurrence of SP. No significant difference was found between SP and non-SP days depending on different aspects of AP and T changes. Most patients were admitted in  clusters  with not more than 2, 3, or 4 days between two successive admissions. The occurrence of SP was significantly correlated with weather phases 2ts (anticyclonic situation with warm and dry weather) and 5 hv (passing of the <e>cold</e> front).

However, the effect of pulmonary hypertension (PH) on LA mechanical function in chronic obstructive lung disease (<e>COLD</e>) has not been studied, yet. METHODS: 49 patients with COLD and 25 controls were included in this study. Patients were divided into two subgroups: patients without PH (group 1, n=21) and with PH (group 2, n=28). LA volumes were determined at mitral valve opening (Vmax), at onset of atrial systole (Vp) and at mitral valve closure (Vmin) according to biplane area-length method. The following LA parameters were calculated: passive emptying volume (PEV=Vmax-Vp), conduit volume [CV=LV stroke volume-(Vmax-Vmin)], passive emptying fraction (PEF=PEV/Vmax), active emptying volume (AEV=Vp-Vmin), active emptying fraction (AEF=AEV/Vp), total emptying volume (TEV=Vmax-Vmin), percent contribution of PEV, CV and AEV to LV stroke volume. RESULTS: Vmax (p&lt;0.01), PEV (p&lt;0.001) and TEV (p&lt;0.05) were lower in group 2 than in the controls, and the differences between group 1 and control group were insignificant (p&gt;0.05). Vp, Vmin, CV and AEV did not differ among three groups. Percent contribution to LV filling of the PEV was decreased in group 2 when compared to group 1 (p&lt;0.05) and the controls (p&lt;0.01). Percent contribution to LV filling of the AEV was increased in group 2 when compared to the controls (p&lt;0.05). There were inverse correlations between pulmonary artery pressure and the following parameters: LV stroke volume (r=-0.43, p&lt;0.01), mitral E/A (r=-54, p&lt;0.001), Vmax (r=-0.35, p&lt;0.05), PEV (r=-40, p&lt;0.01) and PEF (r=-0.43, p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: This study shows that the alterations of LA mechanical functions in patients with COLD are closely correlated to PH levels.

Although bacterial and/or viral infections are considered as the major precipitating factor, the antibiotic strategy in this setting is unclear. The potential benefit of routine antibiotic therapy in the absence of evidence of overt infection remains controversial, and has not been adequately studied in patients admitted to the ICU. To assess the benefit (or lack thereof) of routine early systemic antibiotic therapy in patients with COLD admitted to the ICU. METHODS: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled trial, comparing amoxicillin-clavulanic acid administered for 7 days to a placebo. Patients included are those with documented or suspected COLD, exclusive of other bronchial or lung disease, and admitted for acute exacerbation, in the absence of overt sepsis or broncho-pneumonia, and having no other organ failure. Patients recently hospitalized, having received antibiotics for &gt; 24 h, or on long-term steroids will not be included. Co-interventions (bronchodilators, steroids) are controlled for. Patients will be administered the antibiotic or placebo within 24 hours of admission. EXPECTED RESULTS: A 20% reduction of the duration of clinical symptoms of exacerbation is expected. To this end, 520 patients are planned to be included in 15 centers in a 2-year period. Secondary end-points are the incidence of documented infection (lower respiratory tract or other sites), antibiotic use, the proportion of patients having infection with resistant bacteria, the incidence of endotracheal intubation, the duration of stay and mortality in the ICU and the hospital.",M2

Study of their immunity to influenza virus may help design better strategies to stimulate protective immune responses. METHODS: Immunogenicity of influenza vaccines and immune protection from natural influenza were assessed in older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as part of a vaccine efficacy trial. Subjects received either trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (TVV) intramuscularly and trivalent live <e>cold</e>-adapted influenza virus vaccine (CAIV-T; n=1107) intranasally (inl) or TVV and placebo inl (P; n=1108). RESULTS: In the subsets of study subjects assessed, serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and nasal-wash antihemagglutinin (HA) immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG antibody levels and anti-influenza virus CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity increased after immunization. Mean postimmunization nasal-wash IgA antibody levels to influenza A H3/HA and B HA were statistically higher in the TVV+CAIV-T group (n=957) than in the TVV+P group (n=951). Postimmunization serum HAI and nasal-wash IgA antibodies to influenza A/H3N2 and B viruses were associated with a reduced relative risk for natural influenza infection.

15171038,"[Vascular endothelial dysfunction in patients with chronic obstructive lung diseases]At present data on endothelial dysfunction in chronic obstructive lung diseases (<e>COLD</e>) are lacking while in these diseases, favorable conditions are being established to develop endothelial dysfunction, namely: hypoxia, metabolic dysfunction of the lung endothelium, elevated levels of different biologically active substances, including cytokines, leukotrienes, etc. Sixty males with COLD, whose mean age was 51.16 +/- 1.13 years, were examined. A control group comprised 35 apparently healthy volunteers. Reactive hyperemia and nitroglycerin tests were performed to study endothelial function. The blood levels of desquamated endotheliocytes were determined by the method described by J. Hladovec (1978). According to the findings, the count of circulating endothelial cells was greater in patients with COLD than that in healthy individuals. In patients with severe COLD, the signs of endothelial lesion were most pronounced than in those with mild and moderate COLD. Patients with COLD showed a significantly lower level of current-dependent dilatation than did the controls. At the same time, patients with severe COLD exhibited a more marked decrease in endothelium-dependent dilatation than did those with mild and moderate COLD. Thus, patients with COLD have been found to have signs of endothelial lesion and impairments of the vasoregulatory activity of the vascular wall, which require further studies. These changes manifest themselves just in patients with mild and moderate COLD and they are most marked in patients with severe COLD.",M2
15146384,"[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease--acute bacterial exacerbations]COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) belongs to leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide and results in substantial and everincreasing medical, social and economic burden. The same applies to the Czech Republic as well. To combat the disease the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has been founded in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO). GOLD guideline was published in April 2001 and its Czech version appeared in November 2001. The prevention and management of acute exacerbations of COPD forms one of the basic chapters of the document. A COPD exacerbation is defined as sustained worsening of the patient's condition compared to the stable state and beyond normal day-to-day variations that is acute in onset and may warrant additional treatment in a patient with known COPD. COPD exacerbations can be triggered by both an acute infection (viral or bacterial) and noninfectious cause (air pollution events, <e>cold</e> weather, interruption of regular treatment). Accurate diagnosis and assessment of the severity of COPD exacrbation, adequate therapy including rational application of antibiotics, accurate indication for hospitalization and timely admission to an intensive care unit decrease the COPD -associated mortality.",M2
14720639,"Using risk analysis in Health Impact Assessment: the impact of different relative risks for men and women in different socio-economic groups.The aim of this study is to contribute to the emerging field of quantification of Health Impact Assessment (HIA), by analysing how different relative risks affect the burden of disease for various socio-economic groups (SES). Risk analysis, utilising attributable and impact fraction, raises several methodological considerations. The present study illustrates this by measuring the impact of changed distribution levels of smoking on lung cancer, ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive lung disorder (<e>COLD</e>) and stroke for the highest and lowest socio-economic groups measured in disability adjusted life years (DALY). The material is based on relative risks obtained from various international studies, smoking prevalence (SP) data and the number of DALY based on data available for Sweden. The results show that if smoking would have been eliminated (attributable fraction, AF), the inequality between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups may decrease by 75% or increase by 21% depending on the size of the relative risk. Assuming the same smoking prevalence for the lowest socio-economic group as for the highest (impact fraction), then the inequality may decrease by 7-26%. Consequently, the size of the relative risk used may have a significant impact, leading to substantial biases and therefore should be taken into serious consideration in HIA.",M2
14651761,"Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause morbidity, hospital admissions, and mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality of life. Some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations, which are associated with considerable physiologic deterioration and increased airway inflammation. About half of COPD exacerbations are caused or triggered primarily by bacterial and viral infections (<e>colds</e>, especially from rhinovirus), but air pollution can contribute to the beginning of an exacerbation. Type 1 exacerbations involve increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence; Type 2 exacerbations involve any two of the latter symptoms, and Type 3 exacerbations involve one of those symptoms combined with cough, wheeze, or symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. Exacerbations are more common than previously believed (2.5-3 exacerbations per year); many exacerbations are treated in the community and not associated with hospital admission. We found that about half of exacerbations were unreported by the patients, despite considerable encouragement to do so, and, instead, were only diagnosed from patients' diary cards. COPD patients are accustomed to frequent symptom changes, and this may explain their tendency to underreport exacerbations. COPD patients tend to be anxious and depressed about the disease and some might not seek treatment. At the beginning of an exacerbation physiologic changes such as decreases in peak flow and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)) are usually small and therefore are not useful in predicting exacerbations, but larger decreases in peak flow are associated with dyspnea and the presence of symptomatic upper-respiratory viral infection. More pronounced physiologic changes during exacerbation are related to longer exacerbation recovery time. Dyspnea, common colds, sore throat, and cough increase significantly during prodrome, indicating that respiratory viruses are important exacerbation triggers. However, the prodrome is relatively short and not useful in predicting onset. As colds are associated with longer and more severe exacerbations, a COPD patient who develops a cold should be considered for early therapy. Physiologic recovery after an exacerbation is often incomplete, which decreases health-related quality of life and resistance to future exacerbations, so it is important to identify COPD patients who suffer frequent exacerbations and to convince them to take precautions to minimize the risk of colds and other exacerbation triggers. Exacerbation frequency may vary with the severity of the COPD. Exacerbation frequency may or may not increase with the severity of the COPD. As the COPD progresses, exacerbations tend to have more symptoms and take longer to recover from. Twenty-five to fifty percent of COPD patients suffer lower airway bacteria colonization, which is related to the severity of COPD and cigarette smoking and which begins a cycle of epithelial cell damage, impaired mucociliary clearance, mucus hypersecretion, increased submucosal vascular leakage, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Elevated sputum interleukin-8 levels are associated with higher bacterial load and faster FEV(1) decline; the bacteria increase airway inflammation in the stable patient, which may accelerate disease progression. A 2-week course of oral corticosteroids is as beneficial as an 8-week course, with fewer adverse effects, and might extend the time until the next exacerbation. Antibiotics have some efficacy in treating exacerbations. Exacerbation frequency increases with progressive airflow obstruction; so patients with chronic respiratory failure are particularly susceptible to exacerbation.",M2
14621104,"Pulmonary vascular involvement in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Chronic obstructive lung disease affects the entire lung, not just the airways. Although pulmonary hypertension (PH) has long been recognised in a subset of patients with <e>COLD</e>, the important pathophysiological questions remain unanswered. Oxygen supplementation, however, has been shown to blunt the exercise-induced PH in these patients. Hypercoagulability has also been described in patients with COLD. This may, in part, be due to the inflammatory aspects of COLD exacerbation events. In addition to perivascular inflammation, the pathology of vessels in COLD includes intimal thickening, muscularisation of arterioles, in situ thrombosis, loss of capillaries and precapillary arterioles, and vascular congestion and stasis. Recent work describes apoptosis of septal endothelial cells and decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and one of its receptors, VEGFRII, in lungs from patients with emphysema. Based on this work, a rat model was developed that shows chronic blockade of VEGF receptors leads to septal cell apoptosis and results in emphysema and PH. This animal model has led to prevention trials using 1) a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, 2) a superoxide dismutase mimetic, and 3) alpha1-antitrypsin. These findings highlight the importance of vascular endothelial growth factor, apoptosis, oxidative stress and protease activity in the pathogenesis of emphysema. They also underscore the importance of the vasculature in what is traditionally thought of as an airways disease. Future treatment strategies need to address the vascular components of chronic obstructive lung disease.",M2
14524273,"[Bronchial asthma infectious exacerbations]Bronchial asthma and asthma-like form of COPD often undergo exacerbations with symptoms of infection. Currently, there is a general agreement, that most of these infections that exacerbate asthma especially in children are caused by viruses. Several  common <e>cold</e>  viruses are known to cause these exacerbations (RSV, parainfluenza virus, rhinoviruses). To date, there is no certainty, if viruses exacerbate asthma alone or in combination with allergen. It is also unknown, whether they can induce primary asthma symptoms. There is a growing support for the opinion, that in infectious exacerbations of asthma also bacteria can play an important role. These include both typical as well as atypical bacterial strains (Chlamydia pneumoniae). The effectiveness of antibiotics and bacterial immunotherapy with vaccines seems to support the role of bacteria in asthma exacerbations. Another very important problem is related to the role of infectious agents in prevention of atopy. Many facts have been gathered supporting the so called  hygienic theory .",M2

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An open randomized control trial included COLD patients divided into two groups. Group 1 patients have undergone three-stage rehabilitation: outpatient clinic-hospital-sanatorium, group 2 controls have undergone rehabilitation only in outpatient clinic. The condition of the patients was assessed by physical performance (bicycle exercise, 6-min walk test), external respiration function (spirography), tolerance to dyspnea (questionnaire) at the trial start and in 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months. Three-stage rehabilitation continued for 9 months. RESULTS: Positive changes in physical performance and dyspnea tolerance were more pronounced in three-stage rehabilitation. This trend persisted for 9 months and than positive results got worse. CONCLUSION: Three-stage rehabilitation of COLD patients is highly effective and should be an essential part of COLD treatment policy.",M2

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty nine patients with pneumonia and 77 with COLD were examined. The activity of ACE in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and the effects of leukocytic elastase and concentrations of zinc, endogenous inhibitors, and activators were studied. RESULTS: The patients with pneumonia in the acute phase of the disease have been found to have low ACE activity in both blood and BAL. As the inflammatory process comes to an end, ACE activity normalizes. In the patients with COLD, the activity of ACE is primarily decreased at remission. When COLD aggravates, the activity of ACE in blood and BAL increases. In pneumonia and COLD, the changes in ACE activity are more profound in BAL than in blood. CONCLUSION: The only cause of the altered activity of ACE in patients with COLD and pneumonia is a change in the concentration of the enzyme.",M2

Subjects (N=2215) were randomly assigned to receive either TVV intramuscularly (IM) and CAIV-T intranasally (TC), or TVV and placebo (TP). The vaccines were well-tolerated. Efficacy of TC compared to TP was not statistically significant and was 0.16 for any influenza virus strain (95% confidence limit (CL): -0.22, 0.43), 0.26 for A (H3N2) virus (95% CL: -0.17, 0.53), and -0.05 for type B virus (95% CL: -1.13, 0.48).

Of 585 evaluable first occurrences of acute respiratory illnesses, 94 (16%) were LDI. Respiratory symptoms of cough, sputum production, and dyspnea occurred in &gt;90% of patients with LDI; 68% had documented or subjective fever, and 81% had myalgias. Stepwise logistic regression identified only fever and myalgia as being statistically associated with LDI. During the influenza outbreak period, the positive predictive value of fever and myalgia was 41%. Clinical criteria were poor predictors of LDI in these older, vaccinated patients with chronic lung disease. Additional studies are warranted to define optimal methods for the diagnosis of influenza among older persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",M2
12391710,"Respiratory and allergic diseases: from upper respiratory tract infections to asthma.Patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis may benefit from hydration and a diet low in sodium, omega-6 fatty acids, and transfatty acids, but high in omega-3 fatty acids (i.e., fish, almonds, walnuts, pumpkin, and flax seeds), onions, and fruits and vegetables (at least five servings a day). Physicians may need to be more cautious when prescribing antibiotics to children in their first year of life when they are born to families with a history of atopy. More research is needed to establish whether supplementation with probiotics (lactobacillus and bifidobacterium) during the first year of life or after antibiotic use decreases the risk of developing asthma and allergic rhinitis. Despite a theoretic basis for the use of vitamin C supplements in asthmatic patients, the evidence is still equivocal, and long-term studies are needed. The evidence is stronger for exercise-induced asthma, in which the use of vitamin C supplementation at a dosage of 1 to 2 g per day may be helpful. It is also possible that fish oil supplements, administered in a dosage of 1 to 1.2 g of EPA and DHA per day, also may be helpful to some patients with asthma. Long-term studies of fish oil and vitamin C are needed for more definite answers. For the patient interested in incorporating nutritional approaches, vitamin C and fish oils have a safe profile. However, aspirin-sensitive individuals should avoid fish oils, and red blood cell magnesium levels may help in making the decision whether to use additional magnesium supplements. Combination herbal formulas should be used in the treatment of asthma with medical supervision and in collaboration with an experienced herbalist or practitioner of TCM. Safe herbs, such as Boswellia and gingko, may be used singly as adjuncts to a comprehensive plan of care if the patient and practitioner have an interest in trying them while staying alert for drug-herb interactions. No data on the long-term use of these single herbs in asthma exist. For the motivated patient, mind-body interventions such as yoga, hypnosis, and biofeedback-assisted relaxation and breathing exercises are beneficial for stress reduction in general and may be helpful in further controlling asthma. Encouraging parents to learn how to massage their asthmatic children may appeal to some parents and provide benefits for parents and children alike. Acupuncture and chiropractic treatment cannot be recommended at this time, although some patients may derive benefit because of the placebo effect. For patients with allergic rhinitis, there are no good clinical research data on the use of quercetin and vitamin C. Similarly, freeze-dried stinging nettle leaves may be tried, but the applicable research evidence also is poor. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of these supplements and herbs. Homeopathic remedies based on extreme dilutions of the allergen may be beneficial in allergic rhinitis but require collaboration with an experienced homeopath. There are no research data on constitutional homeopathic approaches to asthma and allergic rhinitis. Patients with COPD are helped by exercise, pulmonary rehabilitation, and increased caloric protein and fat intake. Vitamin C and n-3 supplements are safe and reasonable; however, studies are needed to establish their efficacy in COPD. On the other hand, there are convincing data in favor of N-acetyl-cysteine supplementation for the patient with COPD at doses ranging between 400 and 1200 mg daily. Red blood cell magnesium levels may guide the use of magnesium replacement. The use of L-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 in patients with COPD needs further study. The addition of essential oils to the dietary regimen of patients with chronic bronchitis is worth exploring. Patients with upper respiratory tract infections can expect a shorter duration of symptoms by taking high doses of vitamin C (2 g) with zinc supplements, preferably the nasal zinc gel, at the onset of their symptoms. Adding an herb such as echinacea or Andrographis shortens the duration of the common <e>cold</e>. The one study on Elderberry's use for the flu was encouraging, and the data on the homeopathic remedy Oscillococcinum interesting, but more studies should be performed. Saline washes may be helpful to patients with allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis. Patients also may try the German combination (available in the United States) of elderberry, vervain, gentian, primrose, and sorrel that has been tested in randomized clinical trials. Bromelain is safe to try; the trials of bromelain supplementation were promising but were never repeated. The preceding suggestions need to be grounded in a program based on optimal medical management. Patients need to be well educated in the proper medical management of their disease and skilled at monitoring disease stability and progress. Asthmatic patients need to monitor their bronchodilator usage and peak flow meter measurements to step up their medical treatment in a timely manner, if needed. Patients welcome physician guidance when exploring the breadth of treatments available today. A true patient-physician partnership is always empowering to patients who are serious about regaining their function and health.",M2

DESIGN: Long-term cross-sectional study. METHOD: An analysis was carried out on data collected from the 'Monitoring of risk factors and health in the Netherlands' study (Dutch acronym: MORGEN) in the period 1993-1997. The study involved 9791 men and 11,712 (non-pregnant) women aged 20-59 years from three Dutch cities, Amsterdam, Doetinchem and Maastricht. A written questionnaire was used to collect data on items such as respiratory symptoms, age, educational level and smoking habits. The presence of asthma symptoms was defined as: wheezing without a <e>cold</e>, nocturnal attacks of breathlessness or 'had ever suffered from asthma'. The presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms was defined as: chronic cough, chronic phlegm or breathlessness when walking with people of the same age. Pulmonary function (FEV1) was measured only in 1994-1997 (n = 12,347). Bronchial obstruction was defined as FEV1 &lt; 80% of predicted. Age standardisation was performed using the age distribution of the Dutch population in 1995 as standard. Changes over time were studied using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The age-standardised prevalence of asthma symptoms (circa 14%), COPD symptoms (circa 14%) and obstruction (circa 8%) were comparable in men and women. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms and obstruction was clearly higher in subjects with a low versus a high educational level and this trend was also observed amongst those who had never smoked. After adjustment for age, education and city, the prevalence of respiratory symptoms increased during the study period in women (beta = 0.79% per year (95%-CI: 0.27-1.32)), but not in men. The strongest increase was observed in women aged 40-49 years and in those women with a low educational level. In both men and women no increase in the prevalence of bronchial obstruction was observed.",M2

The revealed invasion of microorganisms occurred against the background of pathology of superficial bronchial epithelium with a decrease of HLA-DR and CD23 lymphocytes and increase of CD1c lymphocytes in lamina propria of bronchial mucosa of the liquidators. Verification of microorganisms characteristic of the upper respiratory tracts and atypical presence of Escherichia coli were found in the contents of the lower parts of broncho-pulmonary system of the liquidators. The obtained results testify to the activation of automicroflora and appearance of pathogenic microorganisms were caused by deterioration of specific and non-specific immune protection in liquidators with COLD.",M2
20392488,"Weekly monitoring of children with asthma for infections and illness during common <e>cold</e> seasons.BACKGROUND: Exacerbations of childhood asthma and rhinovirus infections both peak during the spring and fall, suggesting that viral infections are major contributors to seasonal asthma morbidity. OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate rhinovirus infections during peak seasons in children with asthma and to analyze relationships between viral infection and illness severity. METHODS: Fifty-eight children aged 6 to 8 years with asthma provided 5 consecutive weekly nasal lavage samples during September and April; symptoms, medication use, and peak flow were recorded. Rhinoviruses were identified by using multiplex PCR and partial sequencing of viral genomes. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 36% to 50% of the specimens, and 72% to 99% of the viruses were rhinoviruses. There were 52 different strains (including 16 human rhinovirus C) among the 169 rhinovirus isolates; no strains were found in more than 2 collection periods, and all but 2 children had a respiratory tract infection. Virus-positive weeks were associated with greater cold and asthma symptom severity (P &lt; .0001 and P = .0002, respectively). Furthermore, virus-positive illnesses had increased duration and severity of cold and asthma symptoms and more frequent loss of asthma control (47% vs 22%, P = .008). Although allergen-sensitized versus nonsensitized children had the same number of viral infections, the former had 47% more symptomatic viral illnesses (1.19 vs 0.81 per month, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Rhinovirus infections are nearly universal in children with asthma during common cold seasons, likely because of a plethora of new strains appearing each season. Illnesses associated with viruses have greater duration and severity. Finally, atopic asthmatic children experienced more frequent and severe virus-induced illnesses.",M3

20238351,"Saline nasal irrigation for acute upper respiratory tract infections.BACKGROUND: Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), including the common <e>cold</e> and rhinosinusitis, are common afflictions that cause discomfort and debilitation, and contribute significantly to workplace absenteeism. Treatment is generally by antipyretic and mucolytic drugs, and often antibiotics, even though most infections are viral. Nasal irrigation with saline is often employed as an adjunct treatment for chronic or allergic sinusitis, but little is known about its effect on acute URTIs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of saline nasal irrigation in treating the symptoms of acute URTIs. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2009), EMBASE (1974 to May 2009), CINAHL (1982 to May 2009), AMED (1985 to 2009) and LILACS (May 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical nasal saline treatment to other interventions in adults and children with clinically diagnosed acute URTIs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (DK, GS) independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. All data were analysed using Cochrane Review Manager software. MAIN RESULTS: Three RCTs (618 participants) were included. Most results showed no difference between nasal saline treatment and control. However, there was limited evidence of benefit with nasal saline irrigation in adults. One study showed a mean difference of 0.3 day (out of eight days) for symptom resolution, but this was not significant. Nasal saline irrigation was associated with less time off work in one study. Minor discomfort was not uncommon and 40% of babies did not tolerate nasal saline drops. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Included trials were too small and had too high a risk of bias to be confident about the possible benefits of nasal saline irrigation in acute URTIs. Future trials should involve much larger numbers of participants and be rigorously designed and controlled.",M3
20180695,"Immunogenic yeast-based fermentate for <e>cold</e>/flu-like symptoms in nonvaccinated individuals.BACKGROUND: The common cold has a profound impact on employee attendance and productivity. Seasonal influenza is responsible for approximately 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. Over-the-counter medication efficacy has been questioned, and seasonal vaccination compliance issues abound. Our previously reported randomized trial of an oral fermentation product found an adjuvant benefit for vaccinated individuals in terms of a significantly reduced incidence and duration of cold and flu-like symptoms. METHODS: A concurrent 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 116 subjects with no recent history of seasonal influenza vaccination was conducted. Participants received once-daily supplementation with 500 mg of a dried modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae oral fermentate (EpiCor) or placebo. Clinical outcome measurements included periodic interval-based in-clinic examinations and serologic analysis at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Participants utilized a standardized self-report symptom diary. RESULTS: Subjects receiving the intervention experienced a statistically significant reduction in the incidence (p = 0.01), a nonsignificant reduction in duration (p = 0.10), and no impact on the severity (p = 0.90) of colds or flu-like symptoms, but a more favorable safety profile compared with subjects receiving placebo. CONCLUSIONS: This nutritional-based fermentate appeared to be safe and efficacious in a unique at-risk population and should receive more clinical research as a potential method to reduce the incidence of cold and flu-like symptoms, in individuals with and without a history of influenza vaccination.",M3
20172252,"Cough: a worldwide problem.Cough is a common and important respiratory symptom that can produce significant complications for patients and be a diagnostic challenge for physicians. An organized approach to evaluating cough begins with classifying it as acute, subacute, or chronic in duration. Acute cough lasting less than 3 weeks may indicate an acute underlying cardiorespiratory disorder but is most commonly caused by a self-limited viral upper respiratory tract infection (eg, common <e>cold</e>). Subacute cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks commonly has a postinfectious origin; among the causes, Bordetella pertussis infection should be included in the differential diagnosis. Chronic cough lasts longer than 8 weeks. When a patient is a nonsmoker, is not taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and has a normal or near-normal chest radiograph, chronic cough is most commonly caused by upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease alone or in combination.",M3

20151787,"Effects of intranasal xylometazoline, alone or in combination with ipratropium, in patients with common <e>cold</e>.BACKGROUND: Common cold is one of the most prevalent conditions that family doctors encounter. One of the first symptoms to occur is nasal congestion, which can have a negative impact on daily life and prompts many patients to seek treatment for relief. Xylometazoline nasal spray (Otrivin*) is a topical decongestant that has been used successfully for many years and is generally recognized as an effective and safe therapy. However, most studies have investigated its clinical efficacy in healthy patients and few have included patients with common cold. SCOPE: To review the published clinical efficacy and safety of xylometazoline alone and in combination in the management of nasal congestion in patients with common cold. Literature searches of PubMed and the Cochrane Library were conducted to obtain published open or blinded, randomized, placebo- or active-controlled studies on the use of xylometazoline hydrochloride for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion in patients with common cold. Searches included papers published in English only, up to September 2009. FINDINGS: Despite the small number of studies identified in common cold (n = 4), as per search criteria defined, intranasal xylometazoline quickly and effectively relieved nasal congestion. When used alone, xylometazoline had a clinically relevant decongestant effect that was significantly superior for up to 10 hours compared with placebo. The superior decongestant effect with xylometazoline led to high patient satisfaction with treatment. When used in combination with ipratropium bromide, nasal congestion and rhinorrhoea were treated simultaneously, leading to significantly higher patient general impression scores compared with either agent used alone. Xylometazoline was well tolerated, with generally mild to moderate nasal-related side effects (e.g. epistaxis in 3.4% of patients, and blood-tinged mucus in 10-26% of patients) that were easily resolved; the most frequently reported non-nasal AEs were headache (3.4%) and period pain (10.3%); no cases of sedation were reported. As expected, no rhinitis medicamentosa or rebound congestion was noted with short-term use (&lt;10 days). No clinically important differences in ciliary motility and mucociliary clearance were observed. Xylometazoline does not result in sympathomimetic systemic side effects seen with oral decongestants (e.g. pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine). CONCLUSIONS: The few studies available in common cold suggest that intranasal xylometazoline provides fast and effective relief of nasal congestion and is well tolerated. When xylometazoline is used in combination with ipratropium, patients with common cold experience the additive benefit of nasal congestion and rhinorrhoea being treated simultaneously.",M3
20127751,"Newly identified human rhinoviruses: molecular methods heat up the <e>cold</e> viruses.Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections cause at least 70% of virus-related wheezing exacerbations and cold and flu-like illnesses.

Since 1987, 100 officially recognised HRV serotypes reside in two genetically distinct species; HRV A and HRV B, within the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae.

Since 1999, many globally circulating, molecularly-defined 'strains', perhaps equivalent to novel serotypes, have been discovered but remain uncharacterised. Many of these currently unculturable strains have been assigned to a proposed new species, HRV C although confusion exists over the membership of the species. There has not been sufficient sampling to ensure the identification of all strains and no consensus criteria exist to define whether clinical HRV detections are best described as a distinct strain or a closely related variant of a previously identified strain (or serotype). We cannot yet robustly identify patterns in the circulation of newly identified HRVs (niHRVs) or the full range of associated illnesses and more data are required. Many questions arise from this new found diversity: what drives the development of so many distinct viruses compared to other species of RNA viruses? What role does recombination play in generating this diversity? Are there species- or strain-specific circulation patterns and clinical outcomes? Are divergent strains sensitive to existing capsid-binding antivirals? This update reviews the findings that trigger these and other questions arising during the current cycle of intense rhinovirus discovery.",M3
20088240,"Conventional and alternative medical advice for <e>cold</e> and flu prevention: what should be recommended and what should be avoided?H1N1, seasonal flu, and upper respiratory infection over-the-counter (OTC) prevention recommendations seem daunting, but in reality, only several diverse lifestyle changes, supplements, and prescriptions have adequate evidence that should be discussed with patients. In addition, numerous other recommendations contain little to no evidence. For example, most heart-healthy behavioral changes, such as reducing visceral adipose tissue, simultaneously improve immune health, and this needs to be emphasized. Ethyl alcohol hand gel and plain soap and water should be encouraged, and antimicrobial soaps should be discouraged. Gargling with water and using nasal saline spray are also cost effective and supported with clinical evidence. Vitamins C and D have the largest benefit-to-risk ratio for patients and may reduce the risk of pneumonia from a recent meta-analysis. Other supplements, such has echinacea, vitamin E, and zinc, have some clinical data, but also have potential long-term safety issues. High-calorie antioxidant beverages only encourage weight and waist gain, but a teaspoon or two of honey has antimicrobial activity and may suppress cough. Finally, vaccine compliance as early as possible should be promoted as a selfless act that reduces viral transmission that could cause morbidity and mortality in the most immune vulnerable individuals, and simply promotes herd immunity, rather than a self-centered act whose individual result and response (n = 1) currently and unfortunately seems to mirror the perceived personal effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of the vaccine.",M3
20005468,"Combined inhalational and oral supplementation of ascorbic acid may prevent influenza pandemic emergency: a hypothesis.Occurrence of influenza pandemics is a worldwide phenomenon and a significant cause of mortality and morbidity throughout the globe. It is due to mutations in the influenza virus genetic material creating antigenic drift of pathogenic viral proteins resulting in emergence of new influenza virus strains. Therefore, the vaccines available for prevention of influenza offer no protection against influenza pandemics caused by new virus strains. Moreover, the existing drugs used to combat influenza may be ineffective to treat influenza pandemics due to the emergence of drug resistance in the pandemic virus strain. Therefore, a working strategy must be developed to combat influenza pandemics. In this review we have addressed this problem and reviewed the published studies on ascorbic acid in the common <e>cold</e> and influenza and laboratory studies on the effect of ascorbic acid on influenza virus. We have also correlated the clinical and laboratory studies and developed a hypothesis to prevent influenza pandemics.",M3

OBJECTIVES: To gather data in a non-prescription setting regarding the safety, pattern of use, patients' general assessment of treatment and suitability of making available without medical prescription of this topical combination nasal spray. Design: Post-marketing, non-interventional, non-controlled study reflecting normal over-the-counter (OTC) use of the spray in adults with common cold (n = 1,019). Main outcome measures included pattern of use (patient-reported effectiveness, compliance with treatment) and safety (adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports). RESULTS: Over 92% of patients used the product for the intended indication, 81.4% used it 2 - 3 times/day and the median duration of treatment was 6 days. In total, 39.7% of patients reported 585 ADRs (mean 1.45 ADR/patient) while 60.3% reported no ADRs. Most common side effects were nasal dryness (12.4%), blood tinged mucus (9.3%), nasal discomfort (6.2%), epistaxis (4.2%), generally harmless and of mild severity. Patients who used the product outside the approved indication did not seem to have a higher risk of ADRs. Mean general impression score was 3.4, with 79% of patients rating treatment as  good  to  excellent . CONCLUSIONS: The topical combination nasal spray (xylometazoline plus ipratropium) for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea in adults with common cold has a good safety profile and results in high patient satisfaction in an OTC setting. No reasons could be found to oppose the assertion that the combination spray is suitable for classification as a product not subject to medical prescription.",M3
19926559,"Cough and <e>cold</e> medication use in young children: Pharmacist reaction to changes in Canada.OBJECTIVE: To gauge how community pharmacists will approach questions from the public after Canada begins requiring product labels to state that cough and cold medications should not be used in children younger than 6 years of age. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Province of Saskatchewan, Canada, in February 2009. PARTICIPANTS: 143 community pharmacists. INTERVENTION: Questionnaire was faxed to target group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimates of product use in children aged 2 years to younger than 6 years, pharmacist satisfaction with the new guidelines, and potential plans when the new labels reach the market.Results: 143 pharmacists returned a completed questionnaire by fax. Pharmacists currently recommend products for head colds for children aged 2 years to younger than 6 years more often than antitussives for coughs. More pharmacists were dissatisfied with the new ruling compared with those who were satisfied, with a main concern being that it went too far. Respondents indicated that when the new labels are implemented, they would be more likely to recommend use of the products among close family members than among the public.Conclusion: These results suggest some support for product efficacy but possible concern over potential liability. Pharmacists are also concerned that removing dosing guidelines from packaging may not fully deter parental use of such products.",M3

19906491,"Zinc lozenges as cure for the common <e>cold</e>--a review and hypothesis.A 7-day reduction in duration of common colds was shown by Eby et al. in 1984 using 23mg zinc gluconate throat lozenges. Over the following 25years, 14 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials produced widely differing results with about one-half showing success and the remainder showing failure. Positively charged, ionic zinc (iZn), but not bound zinc, is strongly astringent, antirhinoviral, increases interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) 10-fold, inhibits intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and inhibits the release of vasoactive ingredients from mast cell granules. Solution equilibrium chemistry analytical techniques showed lozenge iZn fraction varying from 0% to 100% of total lozenge zinc between trials, with zinc acetate (ZA) releasing 100% iZn, zinc gluconate (ZG) releasing 72% iZn and other zinc compounds releasing much less or none at physiologic pH 7.4. Since only iZn has in vitro benefits, iZn variations are hypothesized to have produced the widely varying clinical results. In support of the iZn hypothesis, lozenge iZn and total daily iZn in trials were found highly correlated with reductions in common cold durations with statistical significance for mean duration (P&lt;0.001) and median duration (P&lt;0.004), while total zinc (iZn plus bound) showed no correlation with changes in duration. Duration reductions (mean 0 days, median 0.43 days) for multi-ligand ZG and ZA lozenges differed significantly from duration reductions (mean 3.37 days, median 2.9 days) for single ligand ZA and ZG lozenges (P&lt;0.001) showing that additive ligands as flavor-masks damaged or eliminated efficacy. Five of 6 trials with lozenges whose zinc compositions had a first stability constant of 1.7 or less succeeded, while only 2 of 9 trials of lozenges with higher stability succeeded (P&lt;0.02). From the strong, multiple statistical relationships found, it is inferred that iZn is the active ingredient in zinc lozenges for colds, as it is in vitro against rhinoviruses, and that solution chemistry analytical techniques used at physiological pH are correct means for lozenge iZn analysis. Zinc lozenges slowly dissolving in the mouth over a 20-30 min period releasing adequate iZn (18 mg) used each 2h are hypothesized to shorten common colds by 6-7 days, which is a cure for the common cold. Due to inadequate lozenge iZn very few of more than 40 different brands of zinc lozenges on the US market are expected to have any effect on the duration or severity of common colds.",M3

19821274,"WITHDRAWN: Antihistamines for the common <e>cold</e>.BACKGROUND: Although antihistamines are prescribed in large quantities for the common cold, there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective. OBJECTIVES: To assess in patients with a common cold the effects of antihistamines in alleviating nasal symptoms, or the shortening the duration of illness. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2002, issue 4), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specilaized Register; MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003); and EMBASE (1987 to December 2002). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, placebo-controlled trials on treatment of common cold with antihistamines, used either singly or in combination, in adults or children. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors extracted data and trial authors were contacted for further data. Trials were subdivided into monotherapy and combination therapy. Data on general recovery, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and side-effects were extracted and summarized. MAIN RESULTS: We included 32 papers describing 35 comparisons; 22 trials studied monotherapy, 13 trials a combination of antihistamines with other medication. A total of 8930 people suffering from the common cold were included. There were large differences in study designs, participants, interventions, and outcomes. There was no evidence of any clinically significant effect - in children or in adults - on general recovery of antihistamines in monotherapy. First generation - but not non-sedating - antihistamines have a small effect on rhinorrhea and sneezing. In trials with first generation antihistamines the incidence of side effects (especially sedation) is significantly higher with active treatment. Two trials, studying a combination of antihistamines with decongestives in small children, both failed to show any effect. Of the 11 trials on older children and adults, the majority show an effect on general recovery and on nasal symptom severity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antihistamines in monotherapy - in children as well as in adults - do not alleviate to a clinical extent nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, or subjective improvement of the common cold. First generation antihistamines also cause more side-effects than placebo, in particular they increase sedation in cold sufferers.Combinations of antihistamines with decongestives are not effective in small children. In older children and adults most trials show a beneficial effect on general recovery as well as on nasal symptoms. However, it is not clear whether these effects are clinically significant.",M3
19819775,"Physician and parent response to the FDA advisory about use of over-the-counter cough and <e>cold</e> medications.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the likely impact of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory not to use over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold products for children aged &lt;2 years on care provided by pediatricians and parents. METHODS: A mailed survey was completed by 105 community pediatricians (53% response rate), and 1265 parents with children aged &lt;12 years completed a self-administered survey while waiting for an office visit. RESULTS: All physicians were aware of the advisory; 75% agreed with it. Fifty-nine percent did not recommend OTC cough and cold products for children aged &lt;2 years before the advisory, and 35% were less likely to do so afterward. Seventy-three percent of parents were aware of the advisory, 70% believed these products relieved symptoms, 68% did not believe they were dangerous, and 74% had them at home. After the advisory, 21% of parents were more likely to request an antibiotic from the doctor. Among the parents, 225 only had children aged &lt;2 years and 695 only had children aged 2 to 11 years; of these parental groups, 53% and 10% of parents, respectively, did not use these products before the advisory, an additional 33% and 28%, respectively, were less likely to do so afterward, and 15% and 61%, respectively, would continue use them. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians must be prepared for requests from parents for antibiotics and other remedies for symptom relief for their children with colds.

Estimated yearly savings in treatment costs for common cold, for a centre with internal QI, were euro 12,193.83 and it would be euro 1,817 004.65 for the 30 centres in the Region. CONCLUSIONS: Internally assumed QI activities were significantly more effective than external feedback.

19674476,"Validation of a short form Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-21).BACKGROUND: The Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS) is an illness-specific health-related quality-of-life questionnaire outcomes instrument. OBJECTIVES: Research questions were: 1) How well does the WURSS-21 assess the symptoms and functional impairments associated with common <e>cold</e>? 2) How well can this instrument measure change over time (responsiveness)? 3) What is the minimal important difference (MID) that can be detected by the WURSS-21? 4) What are the descriptive statistics for area under the time severity curve (AUC)? 5) What sample sizes would trials require to detect MID or AUC criteria? 6) What does factor analysis tell us about the underlying dimensional structure of the common cold? 7) How reliable are items, domains, and summary scores represented in WURSS? 8) For each of these considerations, how well does the WURSS-21 compare to the WURSS-44, Jackson, and SF-8? STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: People with Jackson-defined colds were recruited from the community in and around Madison, Wisconsin. Participants were enrolled within 48 hours of first cold symptom and monitored for up to 14 days of illness. Half the sample filled out the WURSS-21 in the morning and the WURSS-44 in the evening, with the other half reversing the daily order. External comparators were the SF-8, a 24-hour recall general health measure yielding separate physical and mental health scores, and the eight-item Jackson cold index, which assesses symptoms, but not functional impairment or quality of life. RESULTS: In all, 230 participants were monitored for 2,457 person-days. Participants were aged 14 to 83 years (mean 34.1, SD 13.6), majority female (66.5%), mostly white (86.0%), and represented substantive education and income diversity. WURSS-21 items demonstrated similar performance when embedded within the WURSS-44 or in the stand-alone WURSS-21. Minimal important difference (MID) and Guyatt's responsiveness index were 10.3, 0.71 for the WURSS-21 and 18.5, 0.75 for the WURSS-44. Factorial analysis suggested an eight dimension structure for the WURSS-44 and a three dimension structure for the WURSS-21, with composite reliability coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.97, and Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.76 to 0.96. Both WURSS versions correlated significantly with the Jackson scale (W-21 R=0.85; W-44 R=0.88), with the SF-8 physical health (W-21 R=-0.79; W-44 R=-0.80) and SF-8 mental health (W-21 R=-0.55; W-44 R=-0.60). CONCLUSION: The WURSS-44 and WURSS-21 perform well as illness-specific quality-of-life evaluative outcome instruments. Construct validity is supported by the data presented here. While the WURSS-44 covers more symptoms, the WURSS-21 exhibits similar performance in terms of reliability, responsiveness, importance-to-patients, and convergence with other measures.",M3

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of objectively observed moisture damage and visible mold in the homes on early-life respiratory morbidity and atopic sensitization in a birth cohort. METHODS: Building inspection was performed by building engineers in the homes of 396 children, and the children were followed up with questionnaires from birth to the age of 18 months. Specific immunoglobulin E levels were measured at the age of 1 year. RESULTS: Doctor-diagnosed wheezing was associated with the severity of moisture damage in the kitchen and with visible mold in the main living area and especially in the bedroom of the child. The risk for parent-reported wheezing apart from <e>cold</e> increased with the severity of moisture damage in the kitchen. Moisture damage in the bathrooms or other interior spaces had no significant association with wheezing. No significant associations were observed for other end points, such as cough, or respiratory infections. There was a suggestion for an increased risk for sensitization to cat dander linked with moisture and mold exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This birth-cohort study supports previous observations that moisture mold problems in the kitchen and in the main living area increase the risk for wheezing in early childhood. The results underline the importance of assessing separately the health effects of moisture and mold problems in different areas of the home.",M3

METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 326 eligible children (3-5 years of age) were assigned randomly to receive placebo (N = 104), Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (N = 110), or L acidophilus NCFM in combination with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis Bi-07 (N = 112). Children were treated twice daily for 6 months. RESULTS: Relative to the placebo group, single and combination probiotics reduced fever incidence by 53.0% (P = .0085) and 72.7% (P = .0009), coughing incidence by 41.4% (P = .027) and 62.1% (P = .005), and rhinorrhea incidence by 28.2% (P = .68) and 58.8% (P = .03), respectively. Fever, coughing, and rhinorrhea duration was decreased significantly, relative to placebo, by 32% (single strain; P = .0023) and 48% (strain combination; P &lt; .001). Antibiotic use incidence was reduced, relative to placebo, by 68.4% (single strain; P = .0002) and 84.2% (strain combination; P &lt; .0001). Subjects receiving probiotic products had significant reductions in days absent from group child care, by 31.8% (single strain; P = .002) and 27.7% (strain combination; P &lt; .001), compared with subjects receiving placebo treatment. CONCLUSION: Daily dietary probiotic supplementation for 6 months was a safe effective way to reduce fever, rhinorrhea, and cough incidence and duration and antibiotic prescription incidence, as well as the number of missed school days attributable to illness, for children 3 to 5 years of age.",M3

The goal was to focus on cases that are usually managed out of hospitals and may not be recognized by the traditional adverse events surveillance and reporting programs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of electronic records on ADRs reported to the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System (NJPIES) through the National Poison Data System. Analyses included ADRs involving a single OTC cough and cold product. The number and proportion of reported ADRs to OTC cough and cold medicines were examined and compared by severity level between children &lt;2 years of age, and children from 2 through 11 years of age. RESULTS: A total of 91 pediatric ADRs to OTC cough and cold products were reported to the NJPIES from 2000 through 2007. Of these, 61 cases (67%) were of minor severity. A larger proportion of the children 2-11 years of age (21.2%), compared with children &lt;2 years of age (8.0%), experienced a reaction of moderate to major severity. CONCLUSIONS: While we found fewer ADR cases of moderate to major severity in younger children, our results call for a further review of the safety of OTC cough and cold medicines in children 2 years of age and older.",M3

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to test whether subjects with and without allergic asthma have different responses to infection and to identify baseline patient risk factors that predict cold outcomes. METHODS: Twenty subjects with mild persistent allergic asthma and 18 healthy subjects were experimentally inoculated with rhinovirus-16. Subjects were evaluated at baseline, during the acute infection, and during recovery for asthma and cold symptoms by using a validated questionnaire. Sputum and nasal lavage fluid were evaluated for viral shedding, cytokines, and cellular inflammation. RESULTS: There were no group-specific significant differences in peak cold symptom scores (10.0 +/- 5.8 vs 11.1 +/- 6.2, asthmatic vs healthy subjects), peak nasal viral titers (log(10) 4.3 +/- 0.8 vs 3.7 +/- 1.4 50% tissue culture infective dose/mL, respectively), or changes in peak flow during the study (10% +/- 10% vs 8% +/- 6%, respectively). Rhinovirus-16 infection increased peak asthma index values in the asthmatic group (median, 6 --&gt; 13; P = .003) but only marginally in the healthy group (median, 4 --&gt; 7; P = .09). More asthmatic subjects had detectable eosinophils in nasal lavage and sputum samples at baseline and during infection, but otherwise, cellular and cytokine responses were similar. Baseline sputum eosinophilia and CXCL8 (IL-8) levels were positively associated with cold symptoms, whereas CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1) levels were inversely associated with nasal viral shedding. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that subjects with mild allergic asthma and healthy subjects have similar cold symptoms and inflammatory and antiviral responses. In addition, eosinophilia and other selective baseline measures of airway inflammation in subjects with or without asthma might predict respiratory outcomes with rhinovirus infection.",M3

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of NSAIDs versus placebo and other treatments on the signs and symptoms of the common cold. To determine any adverse effects of NSAIDs in patients treated with NSAIDs for the common cold. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 1) which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialized Register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2009); EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2009); CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2009); ProQuest Digital Dissertations (January 1938 to March 2009); KoreaMed (January 1958 to March 2009) and KMbase (January 1949 to March 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying treatment of the common cold with NSAIDs in adults or children. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four review authors extracted data (SYK, YSM, YJC, YWH). We subdivided trials into placebo-controlled RCTs and NSAIDs versus NSAIDs RCTs. We extracted and summarized data on global efficacies: analgesic effects such as reduction of headache and myalgia; non-analgesic effects such as reduction of nasal symptoms, cough, sputum and sneezing; and side effects. MAIN RESULTS: This review includes nine RCTs, describing 37 comparisons: six were NSAIDs versus placebo, and three were NSAIDs versus NSAIDs. A total of 1064 patients with the common cold were included. In a pooled analysis, NSAIDs did not significantly reduce the total symptom score, or duration of colds.However, for outcomes related to the analgesic effects of NSAIDs (headache, ear pain, and muscle and joint pain) NSAIDs produced significant benefits, and malaise showed a borderline benefit, although throat irritation was not improved. Chills showed mixed results. For respiratory symptoms, cough and nasal discharge scores were not improved, but the sneezing score significantly improved. We found no evidence of increased frequency of adverse effects in the NSAID treatment groups.

Further research is needed to investigate the effect of NSAIDs in relieving respiratory symptoms such as cough and nasal discharge.",M3
19588383,"Garlic for the common <e>cold</e>.BACKGROUND: Garlic is alleged to have antimicrobial and antiviral properties that relieve the common cold, among other beneficial effects. There is widespread usage of garlic supplements. The common cold is associated with significant morbidity and economic consequences. On average, children have six to eight colds per year, and adults have two to four. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether garlic (allium sativum) is effective for either the prevention or treatment of the common cold, when compared to placebo, no treatment or other treatments. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 1), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register; OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March Week 3, 2009); EMBASE (1974 to March 2009); and AMED (1985 to March 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of common cold prevention and treatment comparing garlic with placebo, no treatment or standard treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently reviewed and selected trials from searches, assessed and rated study quality, and extracted relevant data. MAIN RESULTS: Of the five trials identified as potentially relevant from our searches, only one trial met the inclusion criteria. This trial randomly assigned 146 volunteer participants to either a garlic supplement (with 180 mg of allicin content) or a placebo (once daily) for 12 weeks. The trial reported 65 occurrences of the common cold in the placebo group compared with 24 in the garlic intervention group (P &lt; 0.001). The number of days of illness was lower in the garlic group compared with the placebo group (111 versus 366). The number of days to recovery was similar in both groups (4.63 versus 5.63). Because only one trial met the inclusion criteria, limited conclusions can be drawn. The trial relied on self-reported episodes of the common cold, but was of reasonable quality in terms of randomisation and allocation concealment. Adverse effects included rash and odour. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient clinical trial evidence regarding the effects of garlic in preventing or treating the common cold. A single trial suggested that garlic may prevent occurrences of the common cold, but more studies are needed to validate this finding. Claims of effectiveness appear to rely largely on poor quality evidence.",M3
19582635,"Practitioner empathy and the duration of the common <e>cold</e>.OBJECTIVE: This study's objective was to assess the relationship of empathy in medical office visits to subsequent outcomes of the common cold. METHODS: A total of 350 subjects ? 12 years of age received either a standard or enhanced physician visit as part of a randomized controlled trial. Enhanced visits emphasized empathy on the part of the physician. The patient-scored Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) questionnaire assessed practitioner-patient interaction, especially empathy. Cold severity and duration were assessed from twice-daily symptom reports. Nasal wash was performed to measure the immune cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). RESULTS: Eighty-four individuals reported perfect (score of 50) CARE scores. They tended to be older with less education but reported similar health status, quality of life, and levels of optimism. In those with perfect CARE scores, cold duration was shorter (mean 7.10 days versus 8.01 days), and there was a trend toward reduced severity (mean area under receiver-operator characteristics curve 240.40 versus 284.49). After accounting for possible confounding variables, cold severity and duration were significantly lower in those reporting perfect CARE scores. In these models, a perfect score also correlated with a larger increase in IL-8 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Clinician empathy, as perceived by patients with the common cold, significantly predicts subsequent duration and severity of illness and is associated with immune system changes.",M3
19559066,"Comments on serious anaphylaxis caused by nine Chinese herbal injections used to treat common <e>colds</e> and upper respiratory tract infections.Reports describing severe allergic shock and fatality following treatment of a common cold or upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) with a Chinese herbal injection were collected. Our analysis of the risks associated with this treatment suggested that the potential risk of serious, or even lethal, anaphylaxis should preclude its use in treating common colds and URTIs. In light of our findings herein, we propose the following five suggestions for improving the clinical safety of delivering Chinese herbal injections as medical treatments. First, Chinese herbal injections should not be delivered in the clinic to treat patients in accordance with Bian zheng lun zhi (broad-spectrum application based on holistic Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory and methodology), but rather they should be administered to target specific indicated disease processes. Second, Chinese herbal injection indications should be based on the results of double-blind randomized controlled clinical trials. Third, Chinese herbal injections should be used only in cases involving severe disease or to rescue patients in critical condition; they should not be used to treat mild, relatively innocuous diseases, such as common colds and upper respiratory tract infections, given the risk of doing harm. Fourth, Chinese herbal injection formulas should include materials from only a single or a small number of plant sources in known quantities. Fifth, more studies examining the toxicology and allergenic potential of Chinese herbal injections are needed.",M3
19534650,"Compliance towards dispensed medication labelling standards: a cross-sectional study in the state of Penang, Malaysia.Good medicine labelling practice is vital to ensure safe use of medicines. Non-compliance to labelling standards is a potential source of medication errors. This study was intended to evaluate and compare compliance towards labelling standard for dispensed medications between community pharmacists and general practitioners in Penang, Malaysia. A total of 128 community pharmacies and 26 general practitioners' clinics were visited. Using 'Simulated Client Method' (SCM), data were collected on the medications dispensed upon presentation of hypothetical common <e>cold</e> symptoms. The medications dispensed were evaluated for labelling adequacy. Result revealed that majority of the dispensed medications obtained were not labelled according to regulatory requirements. However, general practitioners complied better than community pharmacists in terms of labelling for: name of patient (p&lt;0.001), details of supplier (p&lt;0.001), dosage of medication (p=0.023), frequency to take medication (p=0.023), patient's reference number (p&lt;0.001), date of supply (p&lt;0.001), special instructions for medication (p=0.008), storage requirements (p=0.002), and indication for medication (p&lt;0.001). Conversely, community pharmacists labelled dispensed medications with the words  Controlled Medicine  more often than did general practitioners (p&lt;0.001). Although laws for labelling dispensed medicines are in place, most community pharmacists and general practitioners did not comply accordingly, thereby putting patients' safety at risks of medication errors.",M3
19482755,"Parental misinterpretations of over-the-counter pediatric cough and <e>cold</e> medication labels.OBJECTIVE: Concerns about the safety and efficacy of over-the-counter cold medications have led to a recent US Food and Drug Administration public health advisory against their use in children &lt;2 years of age. Our goal was to examine caregiver understanding of the age indication of over-the-counter cold medication labels and identify factors, associated with caregiver understanding. METHODS: Caregivers of infant children (&lt; or =1 year old) were recruited from clinics at 3 institutions. Questions were administered regarding the use of 4 previously common  infant  over-the-counter cold and cough medicines labeled to consult a physician if used in children &lt;2 years of age. Literacy and numeracy skills were assessed with validated instruments. RESULTS: A total of 182 caregivers were recruited; 87% were the infants' mothers. Mean education level was 12.5 years, and 99% had adequate literacy skills, but only 17% had &gt;9th-grade numeracy skills. When examining the front of the product label, 86% of the time parents thought these products were appropriate for use in children &lt;2 years of age. More than 50% of the time, parents stated they would give these over-the-counter products to a 13-month-old child with cold symptoms. Common factors that influenced parental decisions included label saying  infant,  graphics (eg, infants, teddy bears, droppers), and dosing directions. Caregivers were influenced by the dosing directions only 47% of the time. Caregivers with lower numeracy skills were more likely to provide inappropriate reasons for giving an over-the-counter medication. CONCLUSIONS: Misunderstanding of over-the-counter cold products is common and could result in harm if medications are given inappropriately. Label language and graphics seem to influence inappropriate interpretation of over-the-counter product age indications. Poorer parental numeracy skills may increase the misinterpretation of these products. Opportunities exist for the Food and Drug Administration and manufacturers to revise existing labels to improve parental comprehension and enhance child safety.",M3

19432914,"Examining the evidence for the use of vitamin C in the prophylaxis and treatment of the common <e>cold</e>.PURPOSE: To present a critical evaluation of the current evidence concerning the therapeutic value of vitamin C for the prophylaxis and treatment of the common cold. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane, PubMed, Natural Standard, and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine databases were searched to identify and acquire primary research reports, literature reviews, and secondary analyses related to the clinical objective. Published clinical trials, literature reviews, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews were evaluated for evidence-based practice implications. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C is frequently used for the treatment and prophylaxis of the common cold; however, no published recommendations were found in a review of the nurse practitioner literature that specifically address the efficacy of vitamin C for the common cold. Our literature review revealed that vitamin C is not effective at preventing the common cold in the general adult population; however, it is effective at preventing colds when consumed regularly by athletes training in subarctic conditions. We also found that regular vitamin C consumption may reduce the duration of cold symptoms in both adults and children, but it does not decrease the severity of cold symptoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: NPs should counsel their patients that regular vitamin C consumption may decrease the duration of cold symptoms, but does not affect symptom severity or act as a prophylaxis.",M3

METHODS: A rapid test for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was administered by 16 general pediatricians from May 2002 to April 2005 in infants undergoing medical checkups for the common <e>cold</e>, all of whom were 100 days old or younger and had birthweights of more than 2500 g without underlying disease. Infants were divided into three groups: the Full breastfeeding group, the Partial group, and the Token group. RSV-positive cases were followed up for 10 days after the initial diagnosis and the following three points were investigated: (i) the incidence of hospitalization; (ii) the duration of hospitalization; and (iii) the incidence of requiring oxygen therapy. RESULTS: RSV antigen was detected in 203 of the total of 892 cases, and these were diagnosed as cases of RSV infectious disease. Although there were no significant differences in the hospitalization rate among the three groups, there were significant differences in the duration of hospitalization and the rate of requiring oxygen therapy. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the requirement of oxygen therapy was significantly lower in the Full breastfeeding group (P= 0.032; odds ratio, 0.256; 95% confidence interval, 0.074-0.892).

19389422,"Echinacea for prevention of the common <e>cold</e>: an illustrative overview of how information from different systematic reviews is summarised on the internet.OBJECTIVES: Three systematic reviews of echinacea for the prevention of colds have somewhat different conclusions. Our study objectives were to illustrate how selection criteria for trials in each of the reviews could lead to different conclusions, and to classify the ways in which webpage authors use the reviews to construct advice about echinacea. METHODS: A funnel plot was constructed of all treatment comparisons in the primary trials included in the reviews. A World Wide Web search was undertaken using five major search engines in order to locate webpages that referred to the efficacy of echinacea in cold prevention and also referred to each of the reviews. RESULTS: Twelve webpages were located. Three webpages presented findings from all three reviews; five presented findings from one or two; four used all three reviews as general supporting references. Views about efficacy differed. There were few comments about the sources of heterogeneity between reviews. CONCLUSIONS: Given the residual uncertainty and the gaps between the evidence and the ways that this is summarised on webpages, it may prove difficult for consumers to assimilate the evidence. As well as undertaking high-quality trials in complementary medicine, we also need to ensure precision in the reporting of uncertainty.",M3

19370573,"WITHDRAWN: Nasal decongestants for the common <e>cold</e>.BACKGROUND: The common cold is a major and recurrent cause of morbidity, on average affecting children and adults two or more times each year. Nasal congestion is its commonest symptom and many therapies are marketed for its relief. There is no meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials on the effects of nasal decongestants in the common cold. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of nasal decongestants at reducing the symptom of nasal congestion in adults and children with the common cold and to identify possible adverse effects associated with their use. SEARCH STRATEGY: In this updated review in 2006, the following databases were searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2006, issue 3); MEDLINE (January 1996 to September 2006); OLDMEDLINE (1951 to 1965); EMBASE (1980 to Week 36, 2006). We contacted known principal investigators and pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, placebo controlled trials of single-active oral and topical nasal decongestants in adults and children suffering from common cold. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (DT, GJL) independently extracted data. All outcomes variables were continuous. Subjective outcomes were normalised to a common scale and a weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated. A standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated for the objective outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies in adults, but none in children, fitted all inclusion criteria. There was a small but statistically significant 6% decrease in subjective symptoms after a single dose of decongestant compared with placebo. This was supported by a significant decrease in nasal airways resistance. With repeated doses, nasal decongestants produce a very small statistical benefit of 4% over three to five days, again supported by a decrease in nasal airways resistance. Two studies provided safety data for this meta-analysis, showing a relatively small number of adverse events and only a small increased risk of insomnia with pseudoephedrine compared to placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A single oral dose of nasal decongestant in the common cold is modestly effective for the short term relief of congestion in adults, and these drugs also provide benefit in some individuals after regular use over three to five days. Adverse events in adults are rare and mild. There is insufficient data on the use of these medications in children and therefore they are not recommended for use in children younger than 12 years of age with the common cold.",M3

METHODS: This review assesses two widely used intranasal treatments for nasal congestion and rhinorrhea in the common cold: xylometazoline hydrochloride and ipratropium bromide. RESULTS: Xylometazoline quickly and effectively relieves nasal congestion, while ipratropium is effective at reducing rhinorrhea. When used in combination, a novel approach to treatment, nasal congestion and rhinorrhea are treated simultaneously, providing effective relief from two of the most troublesome symptoms of the common cold Both drugs are well tolerated, with only mild to moderate, nasal-related side effects.

19343556,"Probability error in diagnosis: the conjunction fallacy among beginning medical students.OBJECTIVE: Incorrectly concluding that the probability of a joint event (such as a combination of clinical findings) is greater than the probability of any one of these events alone is known as the conjunction fallacy. It is one type of cognitive error in estimation of probability to which physicians are known to be prone. The purpose of this study was to determine whether beginning medical students are also prone to the conjunction fallacy. METHODS: A total of 134 beginning medical students completed a written exercise in which they assigned percent probabilities to symptoms and combinations of symptoms based on a case vignette of a young woman with the common <e>cold</e>. Rates of violation of the conjunction rule were calculated for the entire sample and calculated and compared for the subsets of men, women, and those with different prior educational and statistics backgrounds. RESULTS: The conjunction rule was violated by 47.8% of the students. Rates of violation did not differ significantly between men and women, among students with different types of prior education, or between students who had and had not taken at least one statistics course. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of medical students were prone to the conjunction fallacy. This proportion, however, was lower than that reported previously for practicing physicians, who may rely more upon  representativeness  to make probability judgments. Teaching medical students about the conjunction fallacy has the potential to reduce the predisposition to this error that may develop during medical training.",M3
19320235,"Effects of dietary supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid on experimental human rhinovirus infection and illness.BACKGROUND: Because studies suggest that the dietary supplement conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has immunomodulatory activities that might benefit common <e>colds</e>, we performed two studies of CLA effects in experimental human rhinovirus (HRV) infection. METHODS: The first study explored whether CLA supplementation (Safflorin; Loders Croklaan, BV, Wormerveer, the Netherlands) altered the virological or clinical course of experimental HRV infection, and the second explored whether CLA affected the frequency and severity of HRV cold-associated sore throat and cough. The trials were randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled. In total, 50 healthy volunteers aged 18-45 years and susceptible to HRV type-39 (serum neutralizing antibody titre &lt; or = 1:2) participated in study 1 and 80 similar volunteers susceptible to Hank's HRV participated in study 2. Participants ingested CLA 2 g/day or placebo for 4 weeks before and 4 days following intranasal HRV inoculation. The primary endpoint for study 1 was the frequency of colds and for study 2 was the symptom severity scores for sore throat and cough. RESULTS: In study 1, 10/24 (42%) placebo compared with 7/21 (33%) CLA participants developed colds (P = 0.53). CLA was associated with significant reductions in mean scores for cough (0 CLA versus 0.9 placebo) and sore throat (0.8 CLA versus 2.9 placebo). In study 2, clinical colds developed in 19/33 (58%) placebo and 27/43 (63%) CLA participants. Symptom scores for cough (0.9 CLA versus 1.0 placebo) and sore throat (2.6 CLA versus 3.2 placebo) were not significantly different. Similarly no differences in nasal viral titres or serological responses were found. CONCLUSIONS: CLA dietary supplementation had no consistent effects on the virological or clinical course of experimental HRV colds. A larger study would be required to detect more subtle effects of CLA on HRV cold-associated symptoms.",M3
19216002,"Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common <e>cold</e> among health care workers in Japan: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Health care workers outside surgical suites in Asia use surgical-type face masks commonly. Prevention of upper respiratory infection is one reason given, although evidence of effectiveness is lacking. METHODS: Health care workers in a tertiary care hospital in Japan were randomized into 2 groups: 1 that wore face masks and 1 that did not. They provided information about demographics, health habits, and quality of life. Participants recorded symptoms daily for 77 consecutive days, starting in January 2008. Presence of a cold was determined based on a previously validated measure of self-reported symptoms. The number of colds between groups was compared, as were risk factors for experiencing cold symptoms. RESULTS: Thirty-two health care workers completed the study, resulting in 2464 subject days. There were 2 colds during this time period, 1 in each group. Of the 8 symptoms recorded daily, subjects in the mask group were significantly more likely to experience headache during the study period (P &lt; .05). Subjects living with children were more likely to have high cold severity scores over the course of the study. CONCLUSION: Face mask use in health care workers has not been demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.

Leventhal, J. Weinman, and L. A. Phillips' (1980) common sense model of illness. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that coping information is schematically encoded within the representations of a specific illness. DESIGN: A 2 (primed vs. control) x 2 (past user of coping strategy vs. nonuser of coping strategy) design was used in 2 experiments with independent samples. A subliminal prime was used to activate a common <e>cold</e> schema outside of conscious awareness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response latencies in milliseconds for correct responses to a target common cold remedy word on a grammatical decision task served as the dependent measure in each experiment. Target words were Lemsip in Experiment 1 and lozenge in Experiment 2. RESULTS: In each experiment, a significant interaction of Prime x Past Strategy Use was obtained. Participants in whom the  common cold  schema was activated and who also reported high past strategy use demonstrated attentional bias to the name of a popular common cold remedy. CONCLUSION: Activation of a schematic representation of illness may automatically activate information related to coping procedures encoded in memory with the illness.",M3
19201928,"Attenuated P2X7 pore function as a risk factor for virus-induced loss of asthma control.RATIONALE: Upper respiratory tract infection is a guideline accepted risk domain for the loss of asthma control. The ionotrophic nucleotide receptor P2X(7) regulates compartmentalized acute inflammation and the immune response to airway pathogens. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that variability in P2X(7) function contributes to neutrophilic airway inflammation during a <e>cold</e> and thereby is linked to acute asthma. METHODS: Research volunteers with asthma were enrolled at the onset of a naturally occurring cold and monitored through convalescence, assessing symptoms, lung function, and airway inflammation. P2X(7) pore activity in whole blood samples was measured using a genomically validated flow cytometric assay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-five participants with mild to moderate allergic asthma were enrolled and 31 completed all visits. P2X(7) pore function correlated with the change in nasal lavage neutrophil counts during the cold (R(s) = 0.514, P = 0.004) and was inversely related to the change in asthma symptoms (R(s) = -0.486, P = 0.009). The change in peak expiratory flow recordings, precold use of inhaled corticosteroids, and P2X(7) pore function were multivariate predictors of asthma symptoms (P = 0.001, &lt; 0.001 and = 0.003 respectively). Attenuated P2X(7) activity was associated with the risk of losing asthma control (crude odds ratio, 11.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-106.4) even after adjustment for inhaled corticosteroids and rhinovirus (odds ratio, 15.0). CONCLUSIONS: A whole blood P2X(7) pore assay robustly identifies participants with loss-of-function genotypes. Using this assay as an epidemiologic tool, attenuated P2X(7) pore activity may be a novel biomarker of virus-induced loss of asthma control.",M3

This study investigated the effects of a hot fruit drink on objective and subjective measures of nasal airflow, and on subjective scores for common cold/flu symptoms in 30 subjects suffering from common cold/flu. The results demonstrate that the hot drink had no effect on objective measurement of nasal airflow but it did cause a significant improvement in subjective measures of nasal airflow. The hot drink provided immediate and sustained relief from symptoms of runny nose, cough, sneezing, sore throat, chilliness and tiredness, whereas the same drink at room temperature only provided relief from symptoms of runny nose, cough and sneezing. The effects of the drinks are discussed in terms of a placebo effect and physiological effects on salivation and airway secretions. In conclusion the results support the folklore that a hot tasty drink is a beneficial treatment for relief of most symptoms of common cold and flu.",M3

This article examines whether sleep duration and efficiency in the weeks preceding viral exposure are associated with cold susceptibility. METHODS: A total of 153 healthy men and women (age range, 21-55 years) volunteered to participate in the study. For 14 consecutive days, they reported their sleep duration and sleep efficiency (percentage of time in bed actually asleep) for the previous night and whether they felt rested. Average scores for each sleep variable were calculated over the 14-day baseline. Subsequently, participants were quarantined, administered nasal drops containing a rhinovirus, and monitored for the development of a clinical cold (infection in the presence of objective signs of illness) on the day before and for 5 days after exposure. RESULTS: There was a graded association with average sleep duration: participants with less than 7 hours of sleep were 2.94 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-7.30) more likely to develop a cold than those with 8 hours or more of sleep. The association with sleep efficiency was also graded: participants with less than 92% efficiency were 5.50 times (95% CI, 2.08-14.48) more likely to develop a cold than those with 98% or more efficiency. These relationships could not be explained by differences in prechallenge virus-specific antibody titers, demographics, season of the year, body mass, socioeconomic status, psychological variables, or health practices. The percentage of days feeling rested was not associated with colds. CONCLUSION: Poorer sleep efficiency and shorter sleep duration in the weeks preceding exposure to a rhinovirus were associated with lower resistance to illness.",M3

However, few agents have been shown in properly conducted clinical trials to be effective for cough due to URI. The present study evaluated the effect of benzonatate 200mg (B), guaifenesin 600 mg (G), their combination (B+G), and placebo (P) on capsaicin-induced cough in 30 adult nonsmokers with acute URI. On 3 separate days within a 7-day period, 1h after ingesting randomly assigned study drug in a double-blind fashion, subjects underwent capsaicin cough challenge testing, which involved inhalation of incremental doubling concentrations of capsaicin until the concentration of capsaicin inducing 5 or more coughs (C(5)) was attained. Each subject received 3 of 4 possible study drugs. G (p=0.01) but not B (p=NS) inhibited cough-reflex sensitivity (log C(5)) relative to P. The combination of B+G suppressed capsaicin-induced cough to a greater degree than B alone (p&lt;0.001) or G alone (p=0.008). The mechanism by which the combination of B+G causes a potentiation of antitussive effect remains to be elucidated.

We evaluate the role of these medications in pediatric fatalities and identified factors that contributed to the death. METHODS: Fatalities that involved a child younger than 12 years and mentioned a cough and cold ingredient were obtained from 5 sources. An independent panel of 8 experts (pediatrics, pediatric critical care, pediatric toxicology, clinical toxicology, forensic toxicology, forensic pathology) used explicit definitions to assess the causal relationship between medication ingestion and death. Contributing factors were identified. RESULTS: Of 189 cases included, 118 were judged possibly, likely, or definitely related to a cough and cold ingredient. Of these 118 cases, 103 involved a nonprescription drug, whereas 15 cases involved a prescription medication alone. Of 103 cases associated with nonprescription drugs, the evidence indicated that 88 involved an overdosage. A dosage could not be assessed in the remaining 15 cases. Several contributing factors were identified: age younger than 2 years, use of the medication for sedation, use in a daycare setting, use of 2 medicines with the same ingredient, failure to use a measuring device, product misidentification, and use of a nonprescription product intended for adult use. All cases that occurred in a daycare setting involved a child younger than 2 years. CONCLUSION: In our sample, pediatric fatalities caused by nonprescription cough and cold medications were uncommon, involved overdose, and primarily affected children younger than 2 years.

19047249,"Pseudoephedrine use among US children, 1999-2006: results from the Slone survey.OBJECTIVE: Pseudoephedrine, a decongestant found in many cough-and-<e>cold</e> and allergy medications, has been associated with deaths and adverse events in young children; however, the absolute risks of pediatric pseudoephedrine use are difficult to assess because the number of children exposed on a population basis and typical patterns of use are unknown. In addition, use may be changing because of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, which limited pseudoephedrine availability. We sought to describe the prevalence and patterns of pseudoephedrine use among US children and to assess any change since the 2005 law took effect. METHODS: We analyzed data on pseudoephedrine use among 4267 children who were aged 0 to 17 years and enrolled from 1999 to 2006 in the Slone Survey, a national random-digit-dial telephone survey of medication use in the US population. RESULTS: Overall, 214 children took pseudoephedrine in a given week. Use was highest for children who were younger than 2 years. Sixteen children (7.5% of users) took &gt;1 pseudoephedrine-containing product within the same week, including 6 children who were younger than 2 years. Of the pseudoephedrine products used, most were multiple-ingredient liquids (58.9%) and multiple-ingredient tablets (24.7%). Fifty-two children (25.0% of users) took pseudoephedrine for &gt;1 week, including 7 children who were younger than 2 years. Use in 2006 (2.9%) was significantly lower than in 1999-2005 (5.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Pseudoephedrine exposure, mostly in the form of multiple-ingredient products, is common among US children, especially children who are younger than 2 years, who are at the highest risk for toxicity and for whom safe dosing recommendations are lacking. Concerning patterns of use include taking &gt;1 pseudoephedrine-containing product concurrently and using pseudoephedrine for extended periods. Pediatric pseudoephedrine use seems to be declining since the institution of the 2005 Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act.",M3

Because of rhinorrhea and frequent use of handkerchiefs, the skin around the nose feels uncomfortably dry and flaky. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: To evaluate the nasolabial skin barrier impairment, 14 female volunteers with a common cold were recruited. Visually assessed clinical scoring and/or biophysical measurements--including transepidermal water loss, stratum corneum hydration, skin colour, squamometry, skin pH, and a skin surface lipid profile analysis--were carried out at the start of the cold, a second time when the severity of the cold symptoms was maximal, and finally when the volunteers felt healthy again and stopped using handkerchiefs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Transepidermal water loss assessments showed significantly higher measurements on the maximum outcome of the nasal cold compared with the time-point when the symptoms of the cold had disappeared. This was in accordance with skin colour chroma a* measurements and the visually assessed skin erythema and scaliness scores, indicating that the superficial nasolabial skin barrier was inferior at the maximum of a nasal cold in comparison with the skin condition when volunteers were fully recovered.",M3

18842617,"Encounters for common illnesses in general practice increased in obese patients.BACKGROUND: Obese patients are known to have more chronic medical conditions. OBJECTIVE: To compare the frequency of encounter for episodes of the 10 most common illnesses in general practice between obese and non-overweight patients. METHODS: Data were derived from the Continuous Morbidity Registration, containing data from four general practices in and around Nijmegen (The Netherlands). In this research and registration network, a matched cohort study was performed. Each obese patient (body mass index &gt; or = 30 kg/m(2)), aged 20-75 years, was matched for age, gender, socio-economic status and general practice, to approximately two patients without the diagnosis 'overweight' or 'obesity'. Over a period of 5 years (January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2004), the frequency of encounter for episodes of the 10 most common illnesses was compared, taking chronic medical conditions into account. RESULTS: At the start, 550 patients with obesity could be identified and were matched to 954 controls. Obese patients presented more common illnesses than non-overweight patients (incidence rate ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.47), in particular common <e>cold</e> (without fever), myalgia of the upper girdle, dermatophytosis and bruise (contusion, haematoma). CONCLUSION: Obese patients present more common illnesses to their GP, such as common cold (without fever), myalgia of the upper girdle, dermatophytosis and bruise (contusion, haematoma).

High prevalence of rhinovirus in hospitalized children and adults has been documented recently. We screened children &gt; or =1 month of age, hospitalized for any infection, for the presence of rhinoviruses and recruited 24 families with &gt; or =2 children for a 3-week follow-up study. Rhinovirus was detected in 46 (28%) of 163 hospitalizations by study children. Most rhinovirus-positive children (85%) had respiratory symptoms. During the follow-up, rhinoviruses were detected in virtually all children and in one-half of adults in families with a rhinovirus-positive index child, but commonly also in families with a rhinovirus-negative index child. Melting temperature and sequence analysis revealed the transmission routes of the viruses and showed that several virus types could circulate in the families simultaneously. Our studies corroborate the major contribution of rhinovirus to hospitalization of children, most often because of wheezing. Young children with respiratory symptoms are major spreaders of rhinovirus in family setting.",M3

We showed that during localized respiratory infections the ratio of activated effector CD8(+) T cells to resting memory/naive CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood increased significantly. Furthermore, the number of effector/memory T cells specific for respiratory viruses declined in blood and increased in the airways, suggesting that these T cells redistributed from blood to airways. T cells specific for the infecting virus were present in the airways for longer periods at increased levels than nonspecifically recruited bystander T cells. After clearance of the infection, the ratio of resting memory and naive CD8(+) T cells normalized in peripheral blood and also memory T cell numbers specific for unrelated viruses that declined during the infection due to bystander recruitment were restored. Taken together, these results showed a significant systemic T cell response during relatively mild secondary infections and extensive dynamics of virus-specific and nonspecific Ag-experienced T cells.",M3

METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-five cases were randomly divided into a laser group (n = 130) and a medication group (n = 125). The laser group were treated with lower energy He-Ne laser radiation at Tiantu (CV 22), Renying (ST 9), Dazhui (CV 14), Fengmen (BL 12), etc. and the medication group were treated mainly with oral administration of Amantadine tablets. The therapeutic effect was assessed after treatment of 5 days. RESULTS: The laser group in alleviation of cough, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sputum sound were significantly better than the medication group (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.01); the cured rate was 68.5% in the laser group and 42.4% in the medication group, the former being better than the latter (P &lt; 0.001).

18817582,"Iota-Carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of rhinovirus infection.BACKGROUND: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the predominant cause of common <e>cold</e>. In addition, HRVs are implicated in the worsening of COPD and asthma, as well as the loss of lung transplants. Despite significant efforts, no anti-viral agent is approved for the prevention or treatment of HRV-infection. RESULTS: In this study we demonstrate that Iota-Carrageenan, a sulphated polysaccharide derived from red seaweed, is a potent anti-rhinoviral substance in-vitro. Iota-Carrageenan reduces HRV growth and inhibits the virus induced cythopathic effect of infected HeLa cells. In addition, Iota-Carrageenan effectively prevents the replication of HRV1A, HRV2, HRV8, HRV14, HRV16, HRV83 and HRV84 in primary human nasal epithelial cells in culture. The data suggest that Iota-Carrageenan acts primarily by preventing the binding or the entry of virions into the cells. CONCLUSION: Since HRV infections predominately occur in the nasal cavity and the upper respiratory tract, a targeted treatment with a product containing Iota-Carrageenan is conceivable. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether Iota-Carrageenan-based products are effective in the treatment or prophylaxis of HRV infections.",M3

In children aged &lt;5 years hospital admissions for asthma fell by 52% and primary care presentations in children under 14 years by over 40%. From 1994 to 2000, primary care consultations for acute respiratory infections in all age groups fell by 36%, and for the common cold by 46%. Isolates for respiratory syncytial virus notified to the Health Protection Agency voluntary reporting scheme fell by 56% between 1993 and 2003. Falls in UK birth rate and improvements in living conditions were reported by the Office of National Statistics over this time. The authors hypothesise that the fall in asthma reflects a fall in respiratory infections, the most important proximal trigger for asthma exacerbations, and that this in turn may be related to a fall in household members to a number too low for effective virus transmission. Future research into the prevalence of asthma must consider the effect of changing respiratory virus burden on populations.",M3
18768579,"Predicting worsening asthma control following the common <e>cold</e>.The asthmatic response to the common cold is highly variable, and early characteristics that predict worsening of asthma control following a cold have not been identified. In this prospective multicentric cohort study of 413 adult subjects with asthma, the mini-Asthma Control Questionnaire (mini-ACQ) was used to quantify changes in asthma control and the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21 (WURSS-21) to measure cold severity. Univariate and multivariable models were used to examine demographic, physiological, serological and cold-related characteristics for their relationship to changes in asthma control following a cold. Clinically significant worsening of asthma control was observed following a cold (mean+/-SD increase in mini-ACQ score of 0.69+/-0.93). Univariate analysis demonstrated that season, centre location, cold duration and cold severity measurements were all associated with a change in asthma control. Multivariable analysis of the covariates available within the first 2 days of cold onset revealed that the day 2 and cumulative sum of day 1 and 2 WURSS-21 scores were significant predictors of the subsequent changes in asthma control. In asthmatic subjects, cold severity within the first 2 days can be used to predict subsequent changes in asthma control. This information may help clinicians prevent deterioration in asthma control following a cold.",M3
18762979,"Prospective study on antibiotics misuse among infants with upper respiratory infections.BACKGROUND: The judicious prescription of antibiotics has become a central focus of professional and public health measures to combat the spread of resistant organisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A one-year multi-center prospective follow-up study of 1,320 healthy infants was conducted. The study aim was to determine the prevalence and identify the predictors of antibiotics misuse in viral respiratory illnesses among healthy infants in the first year of life. Infants born between August 2001 and February 2002 were recruited through the clinics and dispensaries of 117 pediatricians located in the Greater Beirut area of Lebanon. On each routine visit from birth until one year of life, pediatricians reported any episodes of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI; common <e>cold</e>) and bronchiolitis, as well as the treatment type, duration, and dose. Predictors that were considered included infant, maternal, and pediatrician characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 1,320 recruited infants, 770 (58.3%) had common cold or acute bronchiolitis on at least one occasion during the study period. Pediatricians prescribed antibiotics at least once in 21.4% of cases diagnosed as the common cold and 45.5% of cases of acute bronchiolitis. Logistic regression analysis revealed that antibiotics misuse was more common among infants born to mothers with lower educational levels (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-2.3). Furthermore, pediatricians tend to prescribe antibiotics in dispensaries more often than in private clinics (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0-2.3). CONCLUSION: This study shows a substantial quantity of antibiotics prescriptions for common cold and acute bronchiolitis in our population. Our findings suggest that lower maternal education and pediatricians working in dispensaries (versus private clinics) are associated with increased antibiotics misuse.",M3
18758144,"Descriptive study on the circumstances concerning confirmation of contraindications and careful administration upon purchasing over-the-counter <e>cold</e> medication and manifestation of after-use urinary disorders.Over-the-counter medications are primarily for self-medication, where the seller, such as a pharmacist, provides the necessary information and the consumer uses the medication at his or her own discretion based on the information provided. A Web survey was conducted from February 8 to 13, 2006, involving 500 men and women, ranging in age from 50 to 69 years, who had purchased over-the-counter medications for the common cold within the past 3 years. Upon consultation with and purchase of a cold medication from a pharmacist, 84.2% of respondents reported  being asked my symptoms,  and less frequently (12.3-21.3%) being asked about contraindications/careful administration. Most respondents (60.8%) when asked whether they confirmed  contraindications/careful administration  responded negatively, stating they  occasionally do not confirm  or  do not confirm.  In addition, among men aged 50-69 years, it became clear that 6.0% had experienced aggravation of prostatic hypertrophy symptoms after taking a cold medication. It is assumed that symptoms are usually confirmed upon the sale of over-the-counter medications, but the rate of confirming whether the consumer may need to consider contraindications/careful administration is low. Urinary retention is a preventable side effect because the confirmation prior to taking the medication can be made. Accordingly, some of those side effects can be avoided by ensuring the environment for confirming whether the individual corresponds to  contraindications/careful administration  before taking the medication.",M3

Data on explanatory models for the common cold were collected from physicians and laypeople in South Texas and Guadalajara, Mexico. Structured interview materials were developed on the basis of open-ended interviews with samples of lay informants at each locale. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information from each sample on causes, symptoms, and treatments for the common cold. Consensus analysis was used to estimate the cultural beliefs for each sample. Instead of systematic differences between samples based on nationality or level of professional training, all four samples largely shared a single-explanatory model of the common cold, with some differences on subthemes, such as the role of hot and cold forces in the etiology of the common cold. An evaluation of our findings indicates that, although there has been conjecture about whether cultural or lay-professional differences are of greater importance in understanding variation in explanatory models of disease and illness, systematic data collected on community and professional beliefs indicate that such differences may be a function of the specific illness. Further generalizations about lay-professional differences need to be based on detailed data for a variety of illnesses, to discern patterns that may be present. Finally, a systematic approach indicates that agreement across individual explanatory models is sufficient to allow for a community-level explanatory model of the common cold.",M3

18676518,"Cough and <e>cold</e> medication use by US children, 1999-2006: results from the slone survey.OBJECTIVE: Pediatric cough and cold medications are widely marketed in the United States, but the precise patterns of use among children are not known. Such information is especially important given recent reports suggesting that these medications are responsible for previously underappreciated serious adverse events and deaths among children. We sought to describe the prevalence and patterns of pediatric use of cough and cold medications, with particular attention to use among young children. METHODS: We analyzed data on the use of cough and cold medications, defined as any oral medication that contains &gt;or=1 antitussive, decongestant, expectorant, and/or first-generation antihistamine active ingredients, among 4267 US children who were younger than 18 years and enrolled during 1999-2006 in the Slone Survey, a national random-digit-dial telephone survey of medication use by the US population. RESULTS: In a given week, a cough and cold medication was used by 10.1% of US children. Exposure was highest to decongestants (6.3%; mostly pseudoephedrine) and first-generation antihistamines (6.3%; most common were chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, and brompheniramine), followed by antitussives (4.1%; mostly dextromethorphan) and expectorants (1.5%; almost exclusively guaifenesin). Multiple-ingredient products accounted for 64.2% of all cough and cold medications used. Exposure to antitussives, decongestants, and first-generation antihistamines was highest among 2- to 5-year-olds (7.0%, 9.9%, and 10.1%, respectively) followed by children who were younger than 2 years (5.9%, 9.4%, and 7.6%, respectively); expectorant use was low in all age groups. The use of cough and cold medications declined from 1999 through 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 1 in 10 US children uses a cough and cold medication in a given week. The especially high prevalence of use among children of young age is noteworthy, given concerns about potential adverse effects and the lack of data on the efficacy of cough and cold medications in this age group.",M3
18676517,"Unexpected infant deaths associated with use of cough and <e>cold</e> medications.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether caregivers had given infants who died unexpectedly over-the-counter cough and cold medications before the infant deaths to identify sociodemographic risk factors for their use. METHODS: The Arizona Child Fatality Review Program reviews the circumstances surrounding every child death that occurs in the state each year. By statute, the multidisciplinary review teams have access to all medical charts, autopsy reports, law enforcement reports, and other records for their review and use these data to determine the cause of death and its preventability. The data on all infants who died unexpectedly in 2006 and had an autopsy and postmortem toxicologic studies were reviewed for this analysis. RESULTS: Ten unexpected infant deaths that were associated with cold-medication use were identified. The infants ranged in age from 17 days to 10 months. Postmortem toxicology testing found evidence of recent administration of pseudoephedrine, antihistamine, dextromethorphan, and/or other cold-medication ingredients in these infants. The families who used these medications were poor and publicly insured, and 50% of them had limited English proficiency. Only 4 of these infants had received medical care for their current illness before their death. The over-the-counter cough and cold medication had been prescribed by a clinician for only 1 of these infants. CONCLUSIONS: Review of these infants' deaths raises concern about the role of the over-the-counter cough and cold medications in these deaths. These findings support the recommendation that such medications not be given to infants. In addition, these findings suggest that warnings on these medications  to consult a clinician  before use are not being followed by parents.

The purpose of this study was to characterize objectively and subjectively the decongestant and additional effects of xylometazoline in the common cold. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study was performed. Patients with a common cold (n = 61) were treated with xylometazoline 0.1% (n = 29) or placebo (saline solution; n = 32; 1 spray three times a day for up to 10 days). The primary objective was to determine the decongestant effect (nasal conductance); the secondary objectives were to determine the peak subjective effect (visual analog scale), duration of relief of nasal congestion, total and individual cold symptoms and general well-being (patients' daily diary), and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: The decongestant effect of xylometazoline was significantly greater than placebo, as shown by the nasal conductance at 1 hour (384.23 versus 226.42 cm(3)/s; p &lt;or= 0.0001) and peak subjective effect (VAS, 20.7 mm versus 31.5 mm; p = 0.0298). Nasal conductance was significantly superior for up to 10 hours (p = 0.0009) and there was a trend in favor of xylometazoline for up to 12 hours (not statistically significant). Xylometazoline significantly improved total and some individual common cold symptoms scores (p &lt; 0.05), leading to significantly greater patient general evaluation and satisfaction with treatment (p &lt; 0.05). Nineteen AEs were reported: 8 with xylometazoline (all mild-moderate) and 11 with placebo (1 severe). CONCLUSION: Xylometazoline is an effective and well-tolerated decongestant nasal spray that significantly relieved nasal congestion compared with placebo in the common cold and provided long-lasting relief with just 1 spray, helping patients to breathe more easily for a longer period of time.",M3

Nasopharyngeal secretion samples collected during cold-like illness and OM were assayed for upper respiratory viruses and buccal samples were assayed for TNFalpha (-308), IL-10(-1082, -819, -592), IL-6 (-174) and IFN-gamma (+874) polymorphisms. Logistic regression was used to identify genotypes that predict OM coincident with RSV and rhinovirus (RV) infection. Of the 157 children with RV detection (79 male; 132 White, 13 Black, 12 Other; aged 3.6+/-1.5 years), simple logistic regression identified age (B= -0.34, Z= -2.8, P&lt;0.01, OR=0.71), IL-6 (B= -0.76, Z= -3.3, P&lt;0.01, OR=0.47) and IL-10 (B=0.49, Z=2.0, P=0.05, OR=1.6) as significant predictors of OM coincidence. A more complex logistic regression model for RV detection that included selected OM risk factors identified these factors as well as the TNFalpha genotype, OM history, breastfeeding history and daily environment as significant predictors of OM coincidence. Of the 43 children with RSV detection (21 male; 35 White, 5 Black, 3 Other, aged 3.9+/-1.7 years), logistic regression identified IL-10 (B=1.05, Z=2.0, P=0.05, OR=2.9) as a significant predictor of OM coincidence. New OM episodes coincident with evidence of RSV and RV infection were significantly more frequent in children with high production IL-10 phenotypes. The low production IL-6 and high production TNFalpha phenotypes also contributed to OM risk during RV detection. Cytokine polymorphisms may be one of an expectedly large number of genetic factors contributing to the known heritability of OM.",M3

The risk of overdose, incorrect dosing and adverse events is increased in young children due to the greater number of colds they acquire each year. Lack of evidence to support the use of OTC medications in young children is well documented in the literature; however, people continue to use OTC medications with young children. The common cold is generally a mild, self-limited illness that usually improves with time. Recommended care and treatment for the common cold includes symptomatic treatment. This article presents and reviews the available evidence regarding the use of OTC cough and cold medications for pediatric healthcare providers. This review of the evidence will be helpful for healthcare providers to minimize risks to young children who intentionally or unintentionally ingest these medications and to educate child caregivers regarding proper use of OTC cough and cold medications with children.",M3
18513240,"Inflammatory markers in exhaled breath condensate from patients with asthma.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of airway inflammation is important for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a minimally invasive method for assessing inflammation and may be useful for monitoring airway inflammation in asthma. The aims of this study were to establish an EBC collection method, to assess biomarkers reflecting asthmatic airway inflammation, and to determine the relationship of these biomarkers with asthma severity and lung function. METHODS: Fifty-eight non-smoking healthy subjects, seven asymptomatic smokers, nine subjects with common <e>cold</e> and 55 asthmatics with disease severity ranging from mild intermittent to severe persistent were studied. The efficacy of a pipette method was compared with that of a commercial collecting device. pH, CRP, albumin, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and nitrite/nitrate levels were measured in EBC. RESULTS: Except for the quantity of EBC collected and albumin levels, there were no differences between the commercial method and the pipette method in levels of biomarkers measured. Levels of CRP, H(2)O(2) and nitrite/nitrate were significantly higher in the asthma group than that in the control group. In terms of asthma severity, pH and levels of CRP, H(2)O(2) and nitrate were significantly higher in the mild persistent group than that in the other groups. In addition, H(2)O(2) levels in EBC correlated significantly with the level of nitrite/nitrate. FEV(1) and PEF showed significant negative correlations with H(2)O(2) and nitrite/nitrate levels. CONCLUSION: Measurement of EBC biomarkers is a non-invasive and useful way to evaluate airway inflammation in patients with asthma.",M3
