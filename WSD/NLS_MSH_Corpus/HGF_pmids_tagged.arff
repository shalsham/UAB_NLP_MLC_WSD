19239705,"Expression profiling and Ingenuity biological function analyses of interleukin-6- versus nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells.BACKGROUND: The major goal of the study was to compare the genetic programs utilized by the neuropoietic cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the neurotrophin (NT) Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) for neuronal differentiation. RESULTS: The designer cytokine Hyper-IL-6 in which IL-6 is covalently linked to its soluble receptor s-IL-6R as well as NGF were used to stimulate PC12 cells for 24 hours. Changes in gene expression levels were monitored using Affymetrix GeneChip technology. We found different expression for 130 genes in IL-6- and 102 genes in NGF-treated PC12 cells as compared to unstimulated controls. The gene set shared by both stimuli comprises only 16 genes.A key step is upregulation of growth factors and functionally related external molecules known to play important roles in neuronal differentiation. In particular, IL-6 enhances gene expression of regenerating islet-derived 3 alpha (REG3A; 1084-fold), regenerating islet-derived 3 beta (REG3B/PAPI; 672-fold), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15; 80-fold), platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFA; 69-fold), growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH; 30-fold), adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP; 20-fold) and hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>; 5-fold). NGF recruits GDF15 (131-fold), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1; 101-fold) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 89-fold). Both stimuli activate growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) indicating that PC12 cells undergo substantial neuronal differentiation.Moreover, IL-6 activates the transcription factors retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA; 20-fold) and early growth response 1 (Egr1/Zif268; 3-fold) known to play key roles in neuronal differentiation.Ingenuity biological function analysis revealed that completely different repertoires of molecules are recruited to exert the same biological functions in neuronal differentiation. Major sub-categories include cellular growth and differentiation, cell migration, chemotaxis, cell adhesion, small molecule biochemistry aiming at changing intracellular concentrations of second messengers such as Ca2+ and cAMP as well as expression of enzymes involved in posttranslational modification of proteins. CONCLUSION: The current data provide novel candidate genes involved in neuronal differentiation, notably for the neuropoietic cytokine IL-6. Our findings may also have impact on the clinical treatment of peripheral nerve injury. Local application of a designer cytokine such as H-IL-6 with drastically enhanced bioactivity in combination with NTs may generate a potent reparative microenvironment.",M1
19084961,"[Effect of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide on induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines by different cell lines]OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines by different cell lines. METHODS: LPS of P. gingivalis strain ATCC33277 (Pg-LPS) was extracted with phenol-water method, and identified by Limulus test and infrared spectrum analysis. KB, <e>HGF</e>-1 and THP-1 cells were treated with Pg-LPS of different concentrations and time duration, a commercial LPS of E.coli strain O111:B4 (E-LPS) was used as the control. TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 levels in culture supernatants were measured by quantitative ELISA. RESULT: The minimal dosages of both Pg-LPS and E-LPS to solidify Limulus agents were 15 ng/ml and their infrared spectrums were similar. With the treatment of Pg-LPS or E-LPS, the TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels secreted by HGF-1 cells were remarkably increased with a single perk (P&lt;0.01) while a continuous enhancement of secretion by THP-1 cells was observed (P&lt;0.01). Either Pg-LPS or E-LPS stimulated HGF-1 or THP-1 cells to continuously increase the secretion of IL-6 (P&lt;0.01). Both Pg-LPS and E-LPS induced IL-8 secretion by THP-1 cells (P&lt;0.01), but only Pg-LPS showed the similar effect on HGF-1 cells (P&lt;0.01). Neither Pg-LPS nor E-LPS induced KB cells to secrete inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: Pg-LPS can promote target cells to increase their secretion of inflammatory cytokines. KB cells can not be used as the target cell to determine inflammation-causing effect of LPS.",M1
19084916,"Extent of liver resection modulates the activation of transcription factors and the production of cytokines involved in liver regeneration.AIM: To investigate the molecular events involved in liver regeneration following subtotal hepatectomy (SH) as previous studies have largely focused on partial hepatectomy (PH). METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to 70% PH or 90% SH, respectively, and sacrificed at different times after surgery. Untreated and sham-operated animals served as controls. Serum and liver samples were obtained to investigate liver function, apoptosis (TUNEL assay) and transcription factors (NF-kappaB, Stat3; ELISA) or cytokines (<e>HGF</e>, TNF-alpha, IL-6, TGF-alpha, TGF-beta; quantitative RT PCR) involved in liver regeneration. RESULTS: Serum levels of ALT and AST in animals with 70% PH differed significantly from sham-operated and control animals. We found that the peak concentration 12 h after surgery returned to control levels 7 d after surgery. LDH was increased only at 12 h after 70% PH compared to sham. Bilirubin showed no differences between the sham and 70% resection. After PH, early NF-kappaB activation was detected 12 h after surgery (313.21 +/- 17.22 ng/mL), while there was no activation after SH (125.22 +/- 44.36 ng/mL) compared to controls (111.43 +/- 32.68 ng/mL) at this time point. In SH, however, NF-kappaB activation was delayed until 24 h (475.56 +/- 144.29 ng/mL). Stat3 activation was similar in both groups. These findings correlated with suppressed and delayed induction of regenerative genes after SH (i.e. TNF-alpha 24 h postoperatively: 2375 +/- 1220 in 70% and 88 +/- 31 in 90%; IL-6 12 h postoperatively: 2547 +/- 441 in 70% and 173 +/- 82 in 90%). TUNEL staining revealed elevated apoptosis rates in SH (0.44% at 24 h; 0.63% at 7 d) compared to PH (0.27% at 24 h; 0.15% at 7 d). CONCLUSION: The molecular events involved in liver regeneration are significantly influenced by the extent of resection as SH leads to suppression and delay of liver regeneration compared to PH, which is associated with delayed activation of NF-kappaB and suppression of proregenerative cytokines.",M1
19039953,"Chlamydia pneumoniae induces interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 in human gingival fibroblasts.Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium with a unique biphasic developmental cycle that can cause persistent infections. In humans, Chlamydia causes airway infection and has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and atherosclerosis. In addition, recent studies demonstrated that patients with severe periodontitis can harbor C. pneumoniae, which can increase the risk for a host inflammatory response with weighty clinical sequelae. Previous studies have established that periodontal pathogenic bacteria (i.e. Gram-negative bacteria) can induce the synthesis and release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in human gingival fibroblasts. <e>HGF</e> are resident cells of the periodontium that respond to receptor stimulation by producing a variety of substances including cytokines and growth factors. Our results demonstrate that after 48 hr of incubation with viable C. pneumoniae HGF showed a proliferative response, as seen by both colorimetric MTT assay and direct cell count (30% and 35%, respectively). In addition, HGF incubated with viable or UV light-inactivated C. pneumoniae organisms showed an increase in the levels of IL-6 and IL-10, but not IL-4; on the contrary, HGF infected with heat-killed bacteria did not show a significant production of any of the cytokines considered. In conclusion, the present study suggests that C. pneumoniae may modulate the expression of IL-6 and IL-10 by human gingival fibroblasts. Further studies are warranted to clarify the molecular mechanisms of C. pneumoniae in the regulation of cytokine expression by host cells and to elaborate the relevant clinical implications.",M1
18425354,"Autocrine stimulation of human hepatocytes triggers late DNA synthesis and stabilizes long-term differentiation in vitro.Isolated human hepatocytes are of great value in investigating cell transplantation, liver physiology, pathology, and drug metabolism. Though hepatocytes possess a tremendous proliferative capacity in vivo, their ability to grow in culture is severely limited. We postulated that repeated medium change, common to most in vitro systems, may prevent long-term maintenance of hepato-specific functions and growth capacity. To verify our hypotheses we compared the DNA synthesis and differentiation status of isolated human hepatocytes, cultured in medium which was renewed every day or was not changed for 3 weeks ('autocrine' setting). Daily medium change led to rapid hepatocellular de-differentiation without any signs of DNA replication. In contrast, the autocrine setting allowed hepatocytes to become highly differentiated, demonstrated by an elevated ASGPr expression level, and increased albumin and fibrinogen synthesis and release. Cytokeratin 18 filaments were stably expressed, whereas cytokeratin 19 remained undetectable. Hepatocytes growing in an autocrine fashion were activated in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), evidenced by c-Met phosphorylation. However, HGF response was not achieved when the culture medium was renewed daily. Furthermore, the autocrine setting evoked a late but strong interleukin 6 release into the culture supernatant, reaching maximum values after a 10-day cultivation period, and intense BrdU incorporation after a further 5-day period. Our data suggest that preservation of the same medium creates environmental conditions which allow hepatocytes to control their differentiation status and DNA synthesis in an autocrine fashion. Further studies are necessary to identify the key mediators involved in autocrine communication and to design the optimal culture configuration for clinical application.",M1
17331441,"[Production of interleukin-11 and interleukin-6 in cultured human gingival fibroblasts with the stimulation of lipopolysaccharides]OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Escherichia coli (Ec) lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the production of IL-11 and IL-6 from healthy human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>), and the effects of endogenous prostaglandin on HGF IL-11 and IL-6 production stimulated with the above LPS. METHODS: HGF were stimulated with Pg-, Aa-, Ec-LPS of different concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L) for 24 h. And HGF were also stimulated with the combinations of 10 mg/L Pg-, Aa-, Ec-LPS and 10(-6) mol/L indomethacin respectively for 24 h. Levels of IL-11 and IL-6 in the supernatants were quantitated by ELISA. RESULTS: LPS from Aa, Ec, at the concentration of 10 mg/L and from Pg at the concentrations 1, 10 mg/L significantly augmented IL-11 production by HGF. IL-6 production was also significantly increased by stimulation with Aa-LPS at concentrations 1, 10 mg/L and with Ec-, Pg-LPS at concentrations 0.1, 1, 10 mg/L. In addition, IL-11 production was lower than IL-6 production by HGF stimulated with LPS. Indomethacin significantly inhibited IL-6 and IL-11 production in LPS-stimulated HGF. CONCLUSIONS: Aa-, Pg-, Ec-LPS may significantly increase IL-11 and IL-6 level in the supernatants of HGF, and endogenous prostaglandin may upregulate IL-11 and IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated HGF.",M1
17255532,"Membrane-type serine protease-1/matriptase induces interleukin-6 and -8 in endothelial cells by activation of protease-activated receptor-2: potential implications in atherosclerosis.OBJECTIVE: The serine protease MT-SP1/matriptase plays an important role in cell migration and matrix degradation. Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) have been identified as in vitro substrates of MT-SP1/matriptase. Because PAR-2 is expressed in endothelial cells and contributes to inflammatory processes, we sought to investigate the effects of MT-SP1/matriptase on endothelial cytokine expression and analyzed MT-SP1/matriptase expression in vascular cells and atherosclerotic lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: In endothelial cells, recombinant MT-SP1/matriptase dose-dependently induced interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6 mRNA and protein expression dependent on its proteolytic activity. MT-SP1/matriptase time-dependently induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK. Inhibitor experiments revealed that p38 MAPK and PKCalpha were necessary for IL-8 induction. PAR-2 downregulation abolished and PAR-2 overexpression augmented MT-SP1/matriptase-induced IL-8 expression as evidence for PAR-2 signaling. In human atherectomies, MT-SP1/matriptase was expressed in blood cells adherent to the endothelium. Concordantly, basal MT-SP1/matriptase expression was detected in isolated monocytes. Coincubation of monocytes and endothelial cells resulted in an increased IL-8 release, which was reduced after downregulation of endothelial PAR-2 and monocytic MT-SP1/matriptase. CONCLUSION: MT-SP1/matriptase induces release of proinflammatory cytokines in endothelial cells through activation of PAR-2. MT-SP1/matriptase is expressed in monocytes, thus, interaction of monocytic MT-SP1/matriptase with endothelial PAR-2 may contribute to atherosclerosis.",M1
17204543,"Iron chelation acutely stimulates fetal human intestinal cell production of IL-6 and VEGF while decreasing <e>HGF</e>: the roles of p38, ERK, and JNK MAPK signaling.Bacteria have developed mechanisms to sequester host iron via chelators such as deferoxamine (DFO). Interestingly, DFO has been shown to stimulate acute intestinal epithelial cell inflammatory cytokine production in the absence of bacteria; however, this mechanism has not been elucidated. Intestinal epithelial cell production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha is elevated in various gastrointestinal pathologies, including acute intestinal ischemia. Similarly, VEGF and HGF are essential to intestinal epithelial cell integrity. Therapeutic strategies that decrease IL-6 and TNF-alpha while increasing VEGF and HGF therefore have theoretical appeal. We hypothesized that 1) fetal human intestinal epithelial cells acutely produce increased IL-6, TNF-alpha, VEGF, and HGF during iron chelation and 2) the MAPK pathway mediates these effects. Fetal human intestinal epithelial cells were stimulated by iron chelation (1 mM DFO) with and without p38 MAPK, ERK, or JNK inhibition. Supernatants were harvested after 24 h of incubation, and IL-6, TNF-alpha, VEGF, and HGF levels were quantified by ELISA. Activation of MAPK pathways was confirmed by Western blot analysis. DFO stimulation resulted in a significant increase in epithelial cell IL-6 and VEGF production while yielding a decrease in HGF production (P&lt;0.05). Unexpectedly, TNF-alpha was not detectable. p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK inhibition significantly decreased IL-6, VEGF, and HGF production (P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, DFO acutely increases fetal human intestinal epithelial cell IL-6 and VEGF expression while causing an unexpected decrease in HGF expression and no detectable TNF-alpha production. Furthermore, chelator-induced intestinal epithelial cell cytokine expression depends on p38, ERK, and JNK MAPK pathways.",M1
17189976,"Study of interleukin-6 in the spread of colorectal cancer: the diagnostic significance of IL-6.We investigated the diagnostic significance of IL-6 for lymph node metastasis and/or hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer in 65 patients and evaluated the contributions of 8 factors (IL-6, <e>HGF</e>, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1, ELAM-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1) toward Dukes.s classification of 53 patients. We also examined IL-6 expression in tumor tissue. From the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, an optimal cutoff value of 5.8 pg/ml was determined to classify lymph node and/or hepatic metastasis, and that of 6.3 pg/ml was determined to classify hepatic metastasis. These values indicated sensitivities of 55.0% and 71.4%, and specifi cities of 100% and 88.6%, respectively. IL-6, HGF, and ELAM-1 were very useful for distinguishing among Dukes.s A/B group, C group, and D group. In all cases with high IL-6 values (more than 25.0 pg/ml), immunohistochemical staining was positive for IL-6 in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. IL-6 is strongly suspected to be involved in lymph node and/or hepatic metastasis by promoting it through HGF, and serum IL-6 value (pg/ml) would be useful diagnostically to estimate whether or not there is a high risk of lymph node and/or hepatic metastasis.",M1
16859116,"[Inhibitory effect of xipayi mouth rinse on the secretion of IL-6 from human gingival fibroblast induced by lipopolysaccharide]OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of xipayi mouth rinse of different concentrations on the activities of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from human gingival fibroblast (<e>HGF</e>) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: HGF was stimulated with LPS at 25 g/mL, and the radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to examine the effect of xipayi mouth rinse at 12.5 approximately 200 g/mL on the secretion of IL-6 in the supernatant of the cell culture. RESULTS: IL-6 secreted by human gingival fibroblast was significantly inhibited by xipayi mouth rinse in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Xipayi mouth rinse can inhibit the secretion of IL-6 from HGF induced by LPS, suggesting the anti-inflammatory effect of xipayi mouth rinse to treat and prevent periodontal diseases.",M1
16213902,"The effect of hepatocyte growth factor on gut mucosal apoptosis and proliferation, and cellular mediators after severe trauma.BACKGROUND: A severe burn injury is associated with an impairment of gut mucosal integrity and function, which is due to increases in small-bowel epithelial cell apoptosis and decreases in cell proliferation. Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) was shown to improve regeneration in the liver, mesentery, and skin. The purpose of this study was to determine whether HGF can improve small-bowel homeostasis after injury and the cellular mechanisms by which these changes occur. METHODS: Rats were pair-fed, underwent thermal trauma, and received saline (0.9% NaCl; n = 28) or HGF (200 microg/kg iv every 12 hours, n = 28). Small intestine and serum were taken at 1, 2, 5, and 7 days after injury. Measures were mucosal apoptosis, proliferation, villous morphology, and apoptotic and proliferative mediators, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7, Fas and Fas-ligand, Bcl-2, and Bax. In addition, serum cytokines were determined. RESULTS: Gut epithelial cell apoptosis was increased in the saline and HGF groups after the thermal injury. Despite an increase in serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta, HGF did not affect small-bowel cell apoptosis, but it improved proliferation at days 1 and 2 after injury, which was associated with increased villous height and cell per villous, compared with saline controls, P &lt; .05. Increased mucosal cell proliferation was associated with increased Bcl-2 in the HGF group, P &lt; .05. HGF had no effect on apoptotic mediators, such as Fas, Fas-L, or caspase-3 and caspase-7. CONCLUSIONS: HGF improves small-bowel morphology after a severe burn by increasing mucosal Bcl-2 and, concomitantly, small-bowel epithelial cell proliferation.",M1
16125646,"Leukemia inhibitory factor triggers activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, proliferation, invasiveness, and altered protease expression in choriocarcinoma cells.Extravillous trophoblast cells resemble cancer cells with regard to their intrinsic invasiveness. They invade decidual tissue, but, unlike tumor cells, shut down their invasive properties, when they become inappropriate. Stimuli involved in the modulation of invasion, as well as their underlying signaling mechanisms require further clarification. We were especially interested in discovering signals capable of stimulating invasion in otherwise low-invasive cells involved in reproduction. Using the choriocarcinoma cell line Jeg-3 as a model, we have addressed the potential role of cytokine/growth factor-driven activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in this process. Jeg-3 cells were treated with various factors known to induce trophoblast proliferation, differentiation, migration, or invasiveness (insulin-like-growth-factor-II (IGF-II), hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)). Only LIF elicited strong tyrosine phosphorylation and specific DNA-binding activity of STAT3. It induced a significant acceleration of cell proliferation and promoted the capability of Jeg-3 cells to invade into an artificial extracellular matrix. Moreover, LIF influenced the expression pattern of proteases and protease inhibitors with potential relevance for invasiveness (downregulation of mRNA for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) and upregulation of mRNA for caspase-4). In conjunction with earlier work, in which we found that STAT3 DNA-binding activity was increased in invasive cells (choriocarcinoma, first trimester trophoblasts) and absent in non-invasive cells (term trophoblasts), these findings suggest a connection between LIF-driven STAT3 activity and invasiveness of choriocarcinoma and trophoblast cells.",M1
15943769,"Effect of female sex hormones on Campylobacter rectus and human gingival fibroblasts.Recent studies have suggested a relationship between maternal Campylobacter rectus infections and preterm low birth weight. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of female sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone, on C. rectus and human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>). The growth of C. rectus was significantly enhanced by incorporating either estradiol or progesterone in the culture medium. The production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 by HGF increased following stimulation with estradiol or progesterone, at concentrations comparable to those present in the plasma of pregnant women. In addition, a significantly higher secretion of VEGF by HGF treated with the combination of C. rectus and estradiol was observed in comparison with a treatment with C. rectus alone. Stimulation of HGF with VEGF resulted in production of IL-6 and IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner. The capacity of female sex hormones to enhance both C. rectus growth and VEGF, IL-6, and IL-8 production by HGF has the potential to contribute to periodontal disease progression during pregnancy.",M1
15864720,"Clinical significance of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the spread of gastric cancer: role of IL-6 as a prognostic factor.BACKGROUND: It is becoming clear that various cytokines are associated with the spread of cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to compare interleukin (IL)-6 levels in patients with gastric cancer to elucidate the role of IL-6 in predicting the spread of tumors. METHODS: In 60 patients, we assessed the correlation of serum IL-6 (pg/ml) with stage, histological findings, hepatic metastasis, and related factors (hepatocyte growth factor [<e>HGF</e>], IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, and transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta1). We also investigated the diagnostic significance of the IL-6 level for advanced gastric cancer and lymph node metastasis, as well as the association between IL-6 elevation and outcome. Finally, we examined the expression of IL-6 in tumor tissue. RESULTS: Significant relationships were seen between serum IL-6 and stage, depth of tumor invasion (pT), lymphatic invasion (ly), venons invasion (v)*, lymph node metastasis (pN), hepatic metastasis (cH), and HGF (P &lt; 0.01; *P &lt; 0.05). With regard to the diagnostic significance of the IL-6 level for advanced gastric cancer and lymph node metastasis, when the cutoff value of IL-6 was set at 1.97 pg/ml, the sensitivity was 81.8% and 87.5%; specificity was 66.7% and 58.3%; and accuracy was 77.1% and 72.9%, respectively. The 1- and 3-year cumulative survival rates for patients with an IL-6 value of more than 1.97 pg/ml (69.0% and 43.4%, respectively) were significantly lower than those for patients with an IL-6 value of 1.97 pg/ml or less (94.4% and 87.2%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining was positive for IL-6 in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. CONCLUSION: We suspect that IL-6 is involved in cancer invasion and lymph node and/or hepatic metastasis. Our results indicate that IL-6 could be used as a prognostic factor for survival.",M1
15811054,"The potential role of interleukin-17 in the immunopathology of periodontal disease.BACKGROUND: Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is exclusively produced by activated T cells, and this cytokine can induce inflammatory responses, support immune responses (Th1), and stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption in combination with receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK) and RANK ligand (RANKL). These biological functions are relevant to the aetiopathogenesis of periodontitis, and thus we sought to investigate whether IL-17 is produced in periodontal lesions and to assess the relationship of gene expression between IL-17 and other cytokines, and to determine the effect of IL-17 on IL-6 production in human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>). MATERIALS AND METHODS: IL-17 was detected and measured in periodontal tissues obtained as biopsy samples during periodontal surgery and in the cell-free culture supernatants cultured ex vivo, by using Western immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. IL-17 and other cytokine gene expression were investigated by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The contribution of IL-17 to IL-6 production by HGF was studied. RESULTS: IL-17 protein was moderately detected in periodontal tissues. In contrast, IL-17 mRNA was expressed only in nine of 23 periodontitis tissue samples by RT-PCR. The IL-17 mRNA-positive samples simultaneously expressed mRNAs encoding interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-2, RANK, and RANKL, but not IL-4. IL-10 (Th2 cytokine) was detected more frequently in the samples than IFN-gamma and IL-2 (Th1 cytokine). Recombinant human IL-17 induced IL-6 production from HGF in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that IL-17 is produced in periodontal lesions, which may be involved in Th1 modulation and enhance inflammatory reactions via gingival fibroblast-derived mediators in periodontal disease. Thus, IL-17, together with other cytokines, has a potential role in the aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease.",M1
15582131,"Suppression of transforming growth factor-beta results in upregulation of transcription of regeneration factors after chronic liver injury.BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine the effects of dominant-negative TGF-beta receptor expression during liver regeneration in rats with dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced liver injury. METHODS: Rats were first treated with DMN for 3 weeks, and then intravenously injected once with AdTbeta-TR, AdLacZ, or saline. Serial changes in hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using anti-Ki67 antibody, and TUNEL staining, respectively. The mRNA expression of regeneration factors (<e>HGF</e>, TGF-alpha, EGF, and IGF-I) and IL-6 were evaluated by real-time PCR and northern blotting. RESULTS: Anti-TGF-beta molecular intervention up-regulated hepatocyte proliferation and inhibited apoptosis. In the AdTbeta-TR-treated rats, EGF and IGF-I mRNA expression levels were significantly increased at day 1 and remained high for 3 days after gene transfer; TGF-alpha mRNA expression levels were significantly increased at 2 to 5 days after gene transfer; HGF mRNA expression levels were significantly up-regulated at day 2 only after gene transfer; while IL-6 mRNA expression level tended to increase at day 1, but decreased thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: In rats with DMN-induced liver injury, anti-TGF-beta molecular intervention therapy stimulates proliferation and reduces apoptosis of hepatocytes, and also up-regulates the transcription of various growth factors.",M1

METHODS: By enzyme digestion, hPDAC were isolated from human placenta tissue and cultured, and their biological characteristics were studied. The hematopoietic growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) mRNA expression of hPDAC was assayed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: hPDAC was successfully isolated from human placenta tissue, which was further confirmed as mesenchymal stem cell-like cells. HGF including SCF, FL, G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF and IL-6 were expressed in hPDAC. CONCLUSION: hPDAC could be used as feeder layer for umbilical cord blood CD(34)(+) cells ex vivo expansion.",M1
12883476,"Massive liver growth in mice induced by systemic interleukin 6 administration.The multifunctional cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) is expressed in a wide variety of disease states and pathologic processes. Mice deficient in IL-6 display abnormal and delayed liver regeneration and repair. Currently, IL-6 is thought to influence liver growth indirectly by priming hepatocytes to respond to growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) by inducing expression of HGF and by inhibiting hepatocyte apoptosis, as distinct from the direct mitotic effects of IL-6 on myeloid and other cell types. Here, we show that systemic administration of IL-6 using CHO cell tumors in nude mice results in dramatic hepatomegaly and hepatocyte hyperplasia in the absence of liver injury. Liver mass and liver to body mass ratios increased to 2 to 3 times normal because of proliferation of hepatocytes. Liver growth was associated with high levels of serum IL-6 and with activation of the IL-6-signaling pathway, including increased expression of IL-6 receptor-alpha/gp80, activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK)-signaling pathways and induction of downstream target genes, including c-myc. HGF receptor and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha)/epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor activation were decreased in hypertrophied livers, suggesting that IL-6-induced liver growth was independent of these known hepatocyte mitotic pathways. In conclusion, we suggest that IL-6 may function as a direct hepatic mitogen in vivo and, furthermore, that IL-6 warrants closer examination as a potent liver growth factor with potential clinical utility for increasing liver mass following injury.",M1
12710748,"Effect of transforming growth factor-beta1, interleukin-6, and interferon-gamma on the expression of type I collagen, heat shock protein 47, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-2 by fibroblasts from normal gingiva and hereditary gingival fibromatosis.BACKGROUND: Increased collagen and extracellular matrix deposition within the gingiva is the main characteristic feature of hereditary gingival fibromatosis (<e>HGF</e>). To date, it is not well established if these events are a consequence of alterations in the collagen and other extracellular matrix molecules synthesis or disturbances in the homeostatic equilibrium between synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix molecules. Cytokines are important regulators of expression of the profibrogenic genes, including type I collagen and its molecular chaperone heat shock protein (Hsp)47 and proteolytic enzymes degrading extracellular matrix such as matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -2 (MMP-1 and MMP-2). METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the expression and production of type I collagen, Hsp47, MMP-1, and MMP-2 in normal gingiva (NG) and HGF fibroblasts, and investigated the effects of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on the expression of these genes by NG and HGF fibroblasts. RESULTS: Our results obtained from semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR), Western blots, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and enzymographies clearly demonstrated that the expression and production of type I collagen and Hsp47 were significantly higher in fibroblasts from HGF than from NG, whereas MMP-1 and MMP-2 expression and production were lower in fibroblasts from HGF patients. Addition of TGF-beta1 and IL-6, which are produced in greater amounts by HGF fibroblasts, promoted an increase in type I collagen and Hsp47 and a decrease in MMP-1 and MMP-2 expression. IFN-gamma reduced both type I collagen and Hsp47 expression, whereas it had a slight effect on the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-2. CONCLUSION: These patterns of expression and production suggest that enhanced TGF-beta1 and IL-6 production simultaneously increase the synthesis and reduce the proteolytic activities of fibroblasts from patients with HGF, which may favor the accumulation of extracellular matrix observed in patients with this condition.",M1
12608914,"Capsular polysaccharide from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibits IL-6 and IL-8 production in human gingival fibroblast.We previously reported that a capsular polysaccharide (CP) from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 induces bone resorption in a mouse organ culture system and osteoclast formation in mouse bone marrow cultures. However, the effects of A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 CP on human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>) are still unclear. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 CP alters the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 by HGF. When HGF were cultured with various concentrations of Y4 CP for 24 h, IL-6 and IL-8 production decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Y4 CP (100 microg/ml) suppressed the release of IL-6 from 9.09 +/- 0.08 ng/ml to 0.34 +/- 0.21 ng/ml (P &lt; 0.01) and IL-8 production decreased from 3.76 +/- 0.03 ng/ml to 0.09 +/- 0.01 ng/ml (P &lt; 0.01). Y4 CP suppressed 70-80% of the release of IL-6 and IL-8 from HGF stimulated with Y4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), too. Interestingly, anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 CP completely inhibited the effect of A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 CP on IL-6 and IL-8 production from HGF. These results indicate that Y4 CP inhibits the release of IL-6 and IL-8 from HGF, suggesting that A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 modulates the inflammatory response in periodontitis. Remarkably, this inhibitory effect was reversed by specific anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 CP suggesting an important relationship between the organism and the humoral host response.",M1
12540566,"DNA from periodontopathogenic bacteria is immunostimulatory for mouse and human immune cells.Although bacterial DNA (bDNA) containing unmethylated CpG motifs stimulates innate immune cells through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9), its precise role in the pathophysiology of diseases is still equivocal. Here we examined the immunostimulatory effects of DNA extracted from periodontopathogenic bacteria. A major role in the etiology of periodontal diseases has been attributed to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Peptostreptococcus micros. We therefore isolated DNA from these bacteria and stimulated murine macrophages and human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>) in vitro. Furthermore, HEK 293 cells transfected with human TLR-9 were also stimulated with these DNA preparations. We observed that DNA from these pathogens stimulates macrophages and gingival fibroblasts to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 in a dose-dependent manner. Methylation of the CpG motifs abolished the observed effects. Activation of HEK 293 cells expressing TLR-9 which were responsive to bDNA but not to lipopolysaccharide confirmed that immunostimulation was achieved by bDNA. In addition, the examined bDNA differed in the ability to stimulate murine macrophages, HGF, and TLR-9-transfected cells. DNA from A. actinomycetemcomitans elicited a potent cytokine response, while DNA from P. gingivalis and P. micros showed lower immunostimulatory activity. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that DNA from A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and P. micros possesses immunostimulatory properties in regard to cytokine secretion by macrophages and fibroblasts. These stimulatory effects are due to unmethylated CpG motifs within bDNA and differ between distinct periodontopathogenic bacteria strains. Hence, immunostimulation by DNA from A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and P. micros could contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.",M1
12030972,"Testosterone stimulates proliferation and inhibits interleukin-6 production of normal and hereditary gingival fibromatosis fibroblasts.Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (<e>HGF</e>) is a rare oral condition characterized by a slow and progressive enlargement of the gingiva, involving both the maxilla and mandible. In vitro, HGF fibroblasts demonstrate a proliferative index significantly higher than fibroblasts from normal gingiva (NG). The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dihydrotestosterone on the proliferation of gingival fibroblasts derived from patients with HGF (n = 4) and from four healthy individuals. Additionally, we analyzed the effect of dihydrotestosterone on interleukin-6 (IL-6) production and determined the expression levels of androgen receptors in NG and HGF fibroblasts. Gingival fibroblasts from NG and HGF were incubated with increasing concentrations of dihydrotestosterone with or without androgen blockers, and cultured for 24 h, and the proliferation index was determined by automated cell counter. IL-6 production, in this system, was quantified using a  capture  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to measure the mRNA expression of androgen receptors. The results indicated that dihydrotestosterone simultaneously downregulates the production of IL-6 and upregulates the cell proliferation. Finasteride and cyprosterone acetate, two anti-androgens, partially reversed these effects. Androgen receptor mRNA expression was identified in both NG and HGF fibroblasts; however, the levels in NG were higher than those observed in HGF. These results show that testosterone coordinates the proliferation and production of IL-6 of normal and HGF fibroblasts.",M1
11975936,"Immediate early genes and p21 regulation in liver of rats with acute hepatic failure.It has been observed that liver regeneration in acute hepatic failure (AHF) is suppressed [Eguchi et al. Hepatology 1996;24(6):1452-9]. The molecular mechanism regulating this inhibition is not known. We previously reported that in AHF rats, hepatocyte proliferation was significantly impaired with elevation in serum IL-6, TGF-beta1, and <e>HGF</e> [Kamohara et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2000;273(1):129-35]. Following either 70% partial hepatectomy (PH) or liver injury, quiescent mature hepatocytes are  primed  to re-enter the cell cycle. The process of  priming  appears to be triggered by extracellular cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and is characterized by expression of immediate early genes. Under the stimulation of growth factors such as HGF,  primed  hepatocytes exit the G1 phase of the cell cycle. G1-associated cyclins and their inhibitors play a pivotal role in G1/S cell cycle transition. Here, we demonstrate that immediate early gene (i.e. c-myc, c-fos) expression and AP-1 activity are preserved in AHF rat livers despite absence of hepatocyte proliferation. In contrast, p21 mRNA and protein are both over-expressed in AHF livers compared to livers from rats undergoing PH; this elevation leads to inhibition in Cdk2 activity, resulting in G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibition of regeneration.",M1
11842936,"Binary regulation of interleukin (IL)-6 production by EP1 and EP2/EP4 subtypes of PGE2 receptors in IL-1beta-stimulated human gingival fibroblasts.Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) exerts its biological actions via EP receptors, which are divided into four subtypes of EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4. In the present study, we investigated whether PGE2 regulated interleukin (IL)-6 production in human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>) stimulated with IL-1beta and if so, which subtype(s) of PGE2 receptors were involved. Indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, significantly enhanced IL-1beta-induced IL-6 production by HGF, although it completely inhibited IL-1beta-induced PGE2 production. Exogenous PGE2 suppressed the IL-1beta-induced IL-6 production. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that mRNA of EP1, EP2 and EP4, but not EP3 mRNA, was expressed in unstimulated and IL-1beta-stimulated HGF. 11-deoxy-PGE1, a selective EP2/EP3/EP4 agonist, and butaprost, a selective EP2 agonist, inhibited IL-1beta-induced IL-6 production, although butaprost was less potent than 11-deoxy-PGE1. 17-phenyl-omega-trinor PGE2, an EP1 agonist, enhanced IL-1beta-induced IL-6 production. Based on these data, we suggest that PGE2 can up- or downregulate IL-1beta-induced IL-6 production via EP1 receptors or via EP2/EP4 receptors in HGF, respectively. Expression and function of EP1, EP2 and EP4 receptors in HGF may play critical roles in controlling inflammatory periodontal conditions.",M1
11722592,"Constitutive activation of STAT transcription factors in acute myelogenous leukemia.Hematopoietic growth factors (<e>HGF</e>) are essential for proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic precursors and activate a distinct set of JAK-STAT (Janus kinases-signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins. Previous results from our group have shown a strong expression of JAK-STAT proteins in primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts and AML cell lines. Here, we asked whether a constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway might be involved in the pathogenesis of AML. We could demonstrate a constitutive activation of STAT1, 3 and 5 by immunoprecipitation of the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in different human AML cell lines. Three patterns of STAT activation were found: (I) activation of only STAT1, (II) activation of STAT1 in combination with STAT3, and (III) activation of STAT1, 3 and 5. Furthermore, STAT1 and 3 formed stable heterodimers only in cell lines with constitutive STAT3 activation. In all cell lines analyzed, tyrosine phosphorylation of the four known Janus kinases could not be detected, although JAK1 was stably associated with STAT3. To further analyze whether a constitutive activation of tyrosine kinases might contribute to the autonomous growth of AML blasts, inhibitor studies were performed. The tyrphostin AG490, an inhibitor of the JAK-STAT pathway, but not A1, an inactive tyrphostin induced a time- and dose-dependent growth arrest without overt morphological signs of differentiation in AML cell lines. Our results show that STAT transcription factors are constitutively activated in human AML cell lines and might contribute to the autonomous proliferation of AML blasts. Inhibition of this pathway might be of interest for the establishment of more specific antileukemic strategies.",M1
11717194,"Adenosine regulates the IL-1 beta-induced cellular functions of human gingival fibroblasts.In this study we examined the influence of adenosine on the cellular functions of human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>), such as the production of inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrices (ECM), and the expression and function of adhesion molecules. Concerning the expression of adenosine receptors, RT-PCR analysis revealed that HGF expressed adenosine receptor A1, A2a and A2b, but not A3 mRNA. Ligation of adenosine receptors by adenosine or its related analogue, 2-chloroadenosine (2-CADO), N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) or CGS21680 synergistically increased IL-1beta-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production. In terms of ECM expression, adenosine and the adenosine receptor agonists, 2-CADO and CPA, enhanced constitutive and IL-1beta-induced expression of hyaluronate synthase mRNA, but not the mRNA levels of other ECM, such as collagen type I, III and fibronectin. Moreover, the adherence of IL-1beta-stimulated HGF to activated lymphocytes was also inhibited by adenosine, which is in part explained by the fact that adenosine down-regulated the IL-1beta-induced expression of ICAM-1 on HGF. These results provide new evidence for the possible involvement of adenosine in the regulation of inflammatory responses in periodontal tissues.",M1
11525435,"Regulation of cytokine production in human gingival fibroblasts following treatment with nicotine and lipopolysaccharide.BACKGROUND: Patients who smoke are at increased risk for chronic periodontitis (CP). Most studies suggest that the microbial flora in these patients is similar to that found in non-smoking CP patients. Thus, the increased risk for development of CP is not dependent on an altered microbial profile, but rather to some change in the host response to these periopathogens. There is evidence that human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>) derived from diseased sites produce greater amounts of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in vitro than cells derived from healthy sites. This suggests that HGF subpopulations may be selected based upon the inflammatory milieu in which they reside. The hypothesis to be tested was that the combination of nicotine and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could regulate HGF inflammatory mediator production. METHODS: HGF cell cultures were established from explants derived from 10 patients with CP. HGF cell cultures were stimulated with 1 mM, 1 microM, or 1 nM nicotine +/- Escherichia coli or Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS. At 12, 24, or 48-hour time points, the cells were counted and the supernatant was collected for subsequent IL-6 and IL-8 determination in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: At the 24-hour time point, 1 nM nicotine stimulated IL-6 production compared to control (P=0.02). E. coli LPS alone caused a 3- to 4-fold increase in IL-6 and IL-8 production, whereas P gingivalis LPS did not augment IL-6 or IL-8. A synergistic effect upregulating IL-6 was observed with combined treatment of 1 mM nicotine and E. coli LPS or P gingivalis LPS at the 24-hour time point (P&lt;0.0005 and P=0.002, respectively). Similar effects were seen when IL-8 production was evaluated following HGF stimulation with high doses of nicotine and E. coli LPS or P gingivalis LPS. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that nicotine by itself can stimulate HGF IL-6 and IL-8 production. Moreover, the combination of high doses of nicotine and either E. coli or P gingivalis LPS can synergistically upregulate cytokine production. These findings support the hypothesis that a proinflammatory fibroblast phenotype may be elicited in an environment enriched with bacterial LPS and nicotine.",M1
11437212,"Impairment of gingival fibroblast adherence by IL-6/sIL-6R.Interleukin-6 (IL-6) binds to human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>) in the presence of a soluble form of IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). We investigated the effects of IL-6 on the functions of HGF in the presence of sIL-6R. HGF changed their morphology from spindle-shaped to round, and detached from the culture dish by stimulation with IL-6/sIL-6R. In this condition, a signal transducer gp130 and a transcription factor Stat3 were phosphorylated, resulting in activation of transcription factors Stat3 and C/EBPbeta. Cytoskeletal beta-actin and adhesion molecule integrin-alpha5, a subunit of alpha5beta1 integrin (VLA-5), were found to possess potential binding domains for these transcription factors in their promoters. Accumulation of beta-actin and integrin-alpha5 mRNA decreased, contrary to the expectation of the induction of gene transcription. Furthermore, the decrease in their mRNAs was associated with reduced expression of both actin and VLA-5 proteins. These results suggest that the expression of VLA-5 and actin was down-regulated in HGF through an IL-6 signaling pathway, resulting in impairment of HGF adherence.",M1
11327082,"Prostaglandin F2alpha upregulates interleukin-6 production in human gingival fibroblasts.Prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) is a bioactive lipid mediator which has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. However, the roles of PGF2alpha in periodontal lesions are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of PGF2alpha on interleukin (IL)-6 production in human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>). PGF2alpha stimulated IL-6 production in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), proinflammatory cytokines, induced IL-6 production in a time-dependent manner, and PGF2alpha synergistically enhanced IL-6 production induced by IL-1beta and TNFalpha. IL-6 mRNA was expressed in PGF2alpha-stimulated HGF, and PGF2alpha increased IL-6 mRNA levels induced by IL-1beta and TNFalpha. Fluprostenol, a selective FP receptor agonist, could mimic PGF2alpha-induced IL-6 production. Since FP receptors are coupled to elevation of intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), the mechanism of IL-6 production by PGF2alpha was investigated using TMB-8, an inhibitor of Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores, and calphostin C, an inhibitor of PKC. TMB-8 significantly suppressed PGF2alpha-induced IL-6 production, whereas calphostin C showed a stimulatory effect on PGF2alpha-induced IL-6 production. From these data, we suggest that PGF2alpha upregulates IL-6 production through FP receptors in HGF, that PGF2alpha synergistically enhances IL-6 production in IL-1beta- and TNFalpha-stimulated HGF, and that PGF2alpha-induced IL-6 production may be dependent on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and be downregulated by PKC activation. PGF2alpha may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease by enhancing IL-6 levels in periodontal lesions.",M1
11177576,"Interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor-beta 1 control expression of cathepsins B and L in human lung epithelial cells.Cathepsins B and L are commonly expressed cysteine proteinases that play a major role in lysosomal bulk proteolysis, protein processing, matrix degradation, and tissue remodeling. Cathepsins are also implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, tissue injury, and inflammation. Cells at sites of inflammation often show upregulation and secretion of cathepsins. The regulation of cathepsin expression by inflammatory mediators is not well understood. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-10, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), and hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) on expression of cathepsin B and cathepsin L mRNA (quantitative RT-PCR), on protein expression (ELISA, Western blot), and also on enzymatic activity of cathepsins B and L. Investigations were performed using the human lung epithelial cell line A-549. IL-6 was found to induce a concentration-dependent increase in mRNA expression, protein concentration, and enzymatic activity of cathepsin L. Cathepsin B mRNA and protein expression were not affected by IL-6. In contrast, TGF-beta 1 decreased the amount of cathepsin L mRNA and cathepsin B mRNA. At protein level, it was shown that TGF-beta 1 clearly reduced the concentration of cathepsin L but not cathepsin B. The cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-10, and HGF were found to exert no effect on cathepsin B and L expression. In conclusion, these results are the first to show that IL-6 and TGF-beta 1 have opposite effects on the regulation of expression of cathepsins B and L in A-549 human lung epithelial cells. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 induced an upregulation of cathepsin L, whereas TGF-beta 1 suppressed cathepsin B and L expression. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism that affects cathepsin B and L expression.",M1

Many IL-6 effects depend on a naturally occurring soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). Here, the chimeric protein hyper-IL-6, constructed from the human IL-6 protein fused to a truncated form of its receptor, was found to have superagonistic IL-6 properties, and as such, enhanced liver cell regeneration. Hyper-IL-6 reversed the state of hepatotoxicity and enhanced the survival rates of rats suffering from fulminant hepatic failure after D-galactosamine administration. The hyper-IL-6 protein has a significant potential for use in the treatment of severe human liver diseases.",M1
10863963,"Adenosine regulates the production of interleukin-6 by human gingival fibroblasts via cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway.Adenosine has been reported to alter a variety functions of the cells that participate in inflammatory responses. However, the effect(s) of adenosine on human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>), one of the immunomodulator cells in inflamed periodontal lesions, remains to be established. In this study, we examined the influence of adenosine on the production of interleukin (IL)-6 by HGF. Ligation of adenosine receptors with adenosine or its related analogue, 2-chloroadenosine (2-CADO), increased IL-6 production by HGF without any other stimuli. In addition, adenosine and 2-CADO enhanced the cyclic AMP (cAMP) level in HGF as did prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and forskolin. Interestingly, these cAMP-arising reagents and the permeable cAMP analogue, dibutyryl cAMP (dbtcAMP), also increased IL-6 production by HGF. These results suggest that cAMP is involved in adenosine-induced IL-6 production by HGF. Adenosine-induced IL-6 production was suppressed by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H89, indicating that cAMP/PKA pathway is involved in the induction. Moreover, the experiments using antagonists specific for adenosine receptor subtypes revealed that the adenosine-induced IL-6 production by HGF was, at least in part, mediated by the adenosine A2b receptor. These results provide new evidence for the possible effects of adenosine or its related analogue as an immunomodulator in inflammatory periodontal lesions.",M1
10520004,"Prognostic evaluation in multiple myeloma: an analysis of the impact of new prognostic factors.We have analysed the prognostic information for survival of presenting features in an unselected series of 394 myeloma patients. 15 variables with significant prognostic information were identified, among these were some not previously or only recently reported: serum levels of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of collagen I (ICTP) and soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R). In a multivariate Cox analysis six variables were significantly and independently associated with poor survival: high age, low W.H.O.-performance status (PS), high serum levels of calcium, beta-2-microglobulin (beta-2M), IL-6 and sIL-6R. A risk score formed to predict survival for each percentile of the patient population allowed an efficient separation of prognostic groups. The discriminating power of the model compared favourably with three other previously published staging systems applied to the study population. Exclusion of IL-6 and sIL-6R from the model only marginally decreased the efficacy of the separation. The predictive value of some variables (sIL-6R, beta-2M and W.H.O.-PS) decreased significantly over time. We conclude that formation of a risk score based on independent variables is an efficient way to separate prognostic groups, that the contribution of new and not easily available parameters should be thoroughly evaluated before inclusion in prognostic models for clinical use and that the predictive value of parameters may decrease over time.",M1
10473803,"The induction of distinct cytokine cascades correlates with different effects of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor on the lymphocyte compartment in the course of high-dose chemotherapy for breast cancer.The availability of the myeloid hemopoietic growth factors (<e>HGF</e>) granulocyte- and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF and GM-CSF) has enhanced the therapeutic index of high-dose chemotherapeutic antitumoral regimens (HDCT), as well as the rate of severe damage to immune competence. We investigated some immune functions before, during and after one course of HDCT for poor-risk breast cancer and compared the effects of G-CSF and GM-CSF on the immune recovery. They exerted different influences on the functions we examined and showed distinctive patterns of both qualitative and quantitative in vivo activities on the immune system. The main findings were that (a) granulocyte and lymphocyte recovery rates were faster in the patients receiving G-CSF; (b) looking at the lymphocyte compartment, this difference was restricted to the CD3(+)/CD8(+) and CD56(+) lymphocyte subsets; (c) the reconstitution rate of CD19(+) lymphocytes was slow in both groups; (d) at the end of follow-up HLA-DR expression by CD3(+) lymphocytes was higher in the GM-CSF group; (e) the lymphocyte proliferative capacity was restored at a faster rate in the GM-CSF group, whereas cytotoxic activities recovered better in the G-CSF group; (f) the early repopulating phase was characterized by higher interleukin-6 serum levels in the GM-CSF group. Overall, GM-CSF seemed to exert an earlier effect on all T lymphocyte subsets, preventing them from a complete drop during the long-lasting  nadir  of the cell count, whereas G-CSF appeared to boost them strongly, though a few days later, hastening their final recovery. The distinct pattern of the cytokine cascade induced by each factor, consistent with the different functional changes, seemed to account for the peculiarities of their immune modulations.",M1
10397515,"Androgens modulate interleukin-6 production by gingival fibroblasts in vitro.BACKGROUND: Pregnancy and puberty gingivitis have been attributed to increased concentrations of circulating sex hormones. This inflammatory gingival condition is accompanied by the local production of cytokines. The aims of this in vitro study were to assess, in the presence or absence of testosterone (T) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by human gingival fibroblasts (<e>hGF</e>), and to evaluate the effects of flutamide (a common anti-androgen) in this system. METHODS: The effects of the androgens, T and DHT, on IL-6 production were measured in vitro in serum-free, phenol red-free medium. Cells were incubated with or without androgens for 72 hours; the concentration of IL-6 secreted into the medium after an additional 24-hour challenge with IL-1beta plus hormones was estimated by radioimmunoassay. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to examine hGF and periodontal ligament cells (PDL) for the presence of androgen receptor. RESULTS: In serum-free medium, T and DHT at concentrations of 5 x 10(-8) to 10(-7)M significantly (P &lt;0.05) inhibited IL-6 production by hGF. Flutamide, up to concentrations of 2 x 10(-5)M, did not reverse this inhibition. The androgen receptor was identified in both hGF and PDL. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that elevated levels of androgens, specifically testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, could affect the stromal cell response to an inflammatory challenge by downregulation of IL-6 production. This in vitro study lends support to the hypothesis that increased hormones during pregnancy or puberty could modulate the development of localized inflammation.",M1
10225543,"Interleukin (IL)-1 and Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide stimulation of IL-6 production by fibroblasts derived from healthy or periodontally diseased human gingival tissue.BACKGROUND: Human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>) play a key role in tissue repair and destruction. These cells express low levels of interleukin (IL)-6 constitutively and increased levels after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the cytokines IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). However, little information is available on IL-6 production by fibroblasts derived from diseased tissue. The present study compared constitutive and induced IL-6 production by human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) derived from healthy and diseased periodontal tissue. We also evaluated whether IL-1 acted in a synergistic manner with LPS in inducing IL-6 production by HGF and whether LPS acted via CD14. METHODS: HGF derived from healthy and diseased tissue and foreskin fibroblasts were grown to confluency, photographed, and counted, and their constitutive IL-6 production was quantitated by ELISA. Healthy and diseased HGF were also pretreated with IL-1alpha, followed by incubation with Porphyromonas gingivalis or Escherichia coli LPS. Culture supernatants were assessed for IL-6 protein by ELISA and cell lysates for mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In order to determine if LPS stimulation was mediated through the LPS receptor, CD14, surface receptors on HGF were assessed by flow cytometry and the total RNA CD14 mRNA was assessed. RESULTS: Higher quantities of IL-6 were produced by the diseased HGF before and after stimulation than by the healthy HGF. Pretreatment with IL-1alpha followed by LPS stimulation of the healthy and diseased HGF cell lines resulted in an additive effect on IL-6 production. Pretreatment with IL-1alpha followed by a second incubation with the same stimulant produced higher amounts of IL-6 than cultures incubated with LPS alone or following IL-1alpha pretreatment. Similar amounts of IL-6 mRNA were present in unstimulated HGF from either diseased or healthy tissue and in those incubated with IL-1alpha only. After incubation with IL-1alpha and LPS, diseased HGF produced slightly more mRNA than healthy HGF. CD14 was not expressed by healthy or diseased HGF even after stimulation with either P. gingivalis or E. coli LPS. CD14 message was also undetectable. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate heterogeneity among gingival fibroblasts and an additive effect of IL-1 and P. gingivalis LPS on IL-6 production by HGF. Furthermore, the LPS effect on HGF was not mediated by CD14.",M1
10065948,"Direct interaction between gingival fibroblasts and lymphoid cells induces inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression in gingival fibroblasts.In inflamed periodontal lesions, dense infiltration of lymphocytes is usually observed in the extravascular periodontal connective tissue, adjacent to gingival fibroblasts. Our previous study revealed that activated lymphocytes can adhesively interact with gingival fibroblasts in vitro. In the present study, we investigated whether gingival fibroblasts are activated through direct interaction with lymphoid cells by monitoring the expression of inflammatory cytokine mRNA in human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>). Co-culture with various human lymphoid cells in vitro resulted in a marked increase in the expression of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 mRNA by the HGF. In addition, expression of the mRNA of the IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE), which is essential to produce the mature form of IL-1beta, was constitutively observed in the HGF, suggesting that mature IL-1beta is produced by these cells. When HGF were cultured with the culture supernatant of the lymphoid cells, the increase in the inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression was not observed. Similarly, when HGF and lymphoid cells were cultured in the same well but separated by a membrane which prevented direct contact between the cells, no increase in inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression was observed. These results strongly indicate that direct interaction between these heterotypic cell types transduces activation signals into HGF that induce an increase in inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression. Furthermore, IL-1beta mRNA expression in the HGF was synergistically increased when HGF directly interacted with lymphoid cells in the presence of exogeneous IL-1beta. The present study demonstrates that direct interaction between HGF and lymphoid cells stimulates HGF to increase inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression, and raises the possibility that heterotypic cell-cell interaction may facilitate local inflammatory reactions.",M1
9783822,"Involvement of CD14 on human gingival fibroblasts in Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-mediated interleukin-6 secretion.The lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Porphyromonas gingivalis are implicated in the initiation and development of periodontal diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying P. gingivalis LPS-mediated periodontal destruction are still unknown. Here, it was found that P. gingivalis LPS activates human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>) to release interleukin 6 (IL-6) via CD14. Flow-cytometric analysis showed that HGFs bind to fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled LPS, and express CD14 on their surfaces. The binding of FITC LPS was competitively suppressed by unlabelled synthetic lipid A as well as by LPS. LPS-induced IL-6 production was inhibited by anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody in a dose-dependent manner. The binding of FITC LPS to HGF was abrogated by anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody. Engagement of LPS initiated the protein tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and 2, and these events were suppressed by the anti-CD14 monoclonal. These results suggest that CD14 is a cell surface binding site for LPS and is involved in the LPS-mediated activation of HGF.",M1
9715039,"[Interleukin-6 production by human gingival fibroblasts following stimulation with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans]Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans(Aa), elaborating a multiplicity of virulence factor and tissue-damaging products, is considered an etiological agent in periodontal disease. Serotype b is the most frequently isolated serotype in localized juvenile periodontitis patients, suggesting a particularly high periodontopathic potential for serotype b strains. Interleukin-6(IL-6) plays an important role in the mediation of inflammatory and immune responses as well as in the osteoclastic bone resorption. However, there is little information regarding the effect of the different serotypes of Aa on IL-6 production by human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the ability of the three serotypes (a, b, and c) of Aa sonicates to induce the production of IL-6 by HGF. In fibroblast cultures, confluent monolayers of HGF were incubated with sonic extracts of Aa-511 (serotype a), Aa-Y4 (serotype b), and Aa-652 (serotype c) at various concentrations for 48 h at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and air. At the end of the culture period, supernatants were collected and analysed for IL-6 content by using EIA and bioassay. In order to compare the effects of non-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of Aa sonicates on IL-6 production by HGF, we added polymyxin B in cultures with Aa sonicates to bind LPS. The results were summarized as follows. (1) All three serotypes of Aa sonicates had similar dose-dependent stimulant effects on IL-6 production by HGF, and the biological activities of IL-6 correlated with their immunoreactivities. (2) The maximum releases of IL-6 by HGF were achieved at concentrations of 10 to 100 micrograms protein/mL of Aa sonicates, and the ability of Aa-Y4 to induce the release of IL-6 was higher than that of Aa-511 and Aa-652 at these concentrations. (3) Polymyxin B (50 micrograms/mL) effectively decreased the amounts of IL-6 produced by stimulation of the HGF with 10 micrograms protein/mL of Aa sonicates. However, the polymyxin B-treated Aa-Y4 sonicate showed a higher ability to induce the release of IL-6 than the other two strains. These results indicate that Aa-Y4 (serotype b) has a higher potency to induce HGF secretion of IL-6; thus contributing to a comparatively stronger efficacy to the destruction of periodontal tissue in periodontitis.",M1
9689616,"Protease-activated receptors and their role in IL-6 and NF-IL-6 expression in human gingival fibroblasts.The serine protease thrombin is formed at sites of coagulation and inflammation and has been shown to have important proinflammatory cellular effects relevant to the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. Thrombin acts via specific cell surface receptors termed protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and PAR-3, which have a distinctive method of activation. Proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain by thrombin reveals a hidden amino terminus which then acts as a  tethered ligand . A short synthetic peptide (SFLLRN) can also mimic the tethered ligand and activate PAR-1 but not PAR-3. Also, a trypsin-sensitive receptor termed PAR-2 has been described which is activated by the PAR-1 activating peptide SFLLRN. Here we show conclusively by flow cytometric and Northern blot analysis that human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>) express PAR-1 but not PAR-2. In functional studies we also show that thrombin and SFLLRN stimulated increased expression of mRNA encoding nuclear transcription factor NF-IL-6 and IL-6 in vitro. At optimal concentrations, thrombin (10(-7) M) induced 7.6 +/- 0.01 ng/ml immunoactive IL-6 and PAR-1 activating peptide (5 x 10(-5) M) induced 2.2 +/- 0.2 ng/ml (mean +/- standard error of mean). A proteolytically inactive recombinant thrombin (serine 195 to alanine) was without activity. These data show that HGF express PAR-1 and suggest that PAR-1 activation stimulates increased NF-IL-6 and IL-6 gene expression and IL-6 secretion by HGF in vitro. Whether HGF express PAR-3 is unknown, but the fact that SFLLRN was not a complete replacement for thrombin raises the possibility that HGF may express additional thrombin receptors. These findings add weight to the importance of the cytokine-like role played by thrombin and raise the possibility that protease-activated receptors may play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory periodontal disease.",M1
9453616,"Effect of lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokines on interleukin-6 production by healthy human gingival fibroblasts.Cytokines are hormone-like proteins which mediate and regulate inflammatory and immune responses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inflammatory cytokines on regulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>). The HGF cell lines used in this study, H-CL and F-CL, were established by the explant technique from healthy gingival tissue. Cultured cells were grown to confluency and incubated with various concentrations of LPS from Escherichia coli or Porphyromonas gingivalis or with the recombinant human cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1alpha, or IL-1beta. Culture supernatants were collected at various times and assessed for IL-6 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Total RNA was isolated from the harvested cells and used to assess levels of IL-6 mRNA by the RNase protection assay. Both LPS preparations induced IL-6 production (1 to 4 ng of IL-6 per ml) by both HGF cell lines. Although TNF-alpha stimulated IL-6 production by HGF, &gt; 10-fold-larger amounts were induced with IL-1alpha and IL-1beta. Furthermore, the addition of both IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha to cultured cells resulted in approximately 600- to 800-fold-higher levels of IL-6 than seen in control cultures, suggesting that these cytokines synergistically induced IL-6 production by HGF. IL-6 message in cultured cells was upregulated 20-fold by TNF-alpha, 1,000-fold by IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and 1,400-fold by IL-1alpha plus TNF-alpha. IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha alone upregulate IL-6 production in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The addition of IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha to cultured HGF cells resulted in a synergistic induction of IL-6 after 8 h of incubation and when greater than 10 pg of this combination per ml was used. Our studies show that inflammatory cytokines are hundreds of times more potent than LPS in stimulating IL-6 production by HGF.",M1
9385777,"Correlation of interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and periodontitis.In order to understand the role of IL-1 beta and IL-6 in the periodontal tissue destruction coincident to periodontitis, we assessed the levels of these two mediators in both the gingival tissue and the serum of patients with periodontal disease and of periodontally healthy subjects. In addition, production of IL-6 by six healthy human gingival fibroblast (<e>HGF</e>) strains in response to IL-1 beta was also investigated. The levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 in gingival tissues and in serum were examined by ELISA. Both mediators were observed to increase in diseased tissues of patients with adult periodontitis, and there was a positively significant relationship between both mediators and clinical assessments of periodontal destruction. Moreover, a significant correlation was also noted between levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 in gingival tissues of periodontitis patients (r = 0.4334, p &lt; 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the serum levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 between periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy controls. In fibroblast cultures, confluent monolayers of HGF were incubated with recombinant human IL-1 beta for 48 h at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and air. At the end of the culture period, supernatants were collected and assayed for IL-6 activity by inducing proliferation in the IL-6-dependent hybridoma cell line 7TD1. A dose-dependent stimulatory effect of IL-1 beta on IL-6 production by HGF was noted, wherein 3 strains exhibited higher IL-6 activity than the other 3. These data indicate that the levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 in gingival tissues are closely related to the severity of periodontal disease and that the IL-1 beta and IL-6 produced in gingival tissues may not reflect these two mediators levels in serum. Moreover, IL-1 beta responsiveness of HGF in IL-6 production depends on both the concentration of IL-1 beta and cells of individual subjects. Since HGF are present in periodontal lesion, it is possible that IL-6 secretion stimulated by exposure to inflammatory cell products such as IL-1 beta may participate in the destruction of periodontal tissue in periodontitis.",M1
9401927,"Interleukin-6 production in human fibroblasts derived from periodontal tissues is differentially regulated by cytokines and a glucocorticoid.Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is thought to be a major mediator of the host's defense against infection, and it regulates immune responses in inflamed tissue. In this study, we investigated the regulation of IL-6 production in human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>) and human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPLF). Pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha stimulated IL-6 production in HGF and HPLF in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, or TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 production was enhanced, but the cAMP accumulation they induced was inhibited by the addition of indomethacin. This result suggests that endogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) partially inhibits IL-1 or TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 production and that the enhancement of IL-6 production by IL-1 or TNF-alpha may not be caused through endogenous PGE2-induced cAMP-dependent pathway. Dexamethasone (DEX), a glucocorticoid which is a inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B activation, markedly inhibited IL-1 (alpha or beta) or TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 production; so this production may be partially mediated through NF-kappa B. IL-1 (alpha or beta) and TNF-alpha enhanced IL-6 production synergistically. IL-6 production in HGF or HPLF stimulated with IL-1 beta was augmented by the addition of interferon (IFN)-gamma, but was slightly suppressed by the addition of IL-4. Endogenous IL-6 enhanced IL-1 (alpha or beta)-induced IL-6 production in the presence of IL-6 soluble receptor (IL-6sR). Accordingly, in inflamed periodontal tissues, gingival fibroblasts and periodontal ligament fibroblasts stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 or TNF-alpha, may produce IL-6, and this production can be differentially modulated by endogenous PGE2, IL-6sR, T cell-derived cytokines such as IFN-gamma or IL-4, and glucocorticoids.",M1
8884644,"Gingival fibroblast cytokine profiles in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis.Within the in vivo environment human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>) may be challenged with bacteria or bacterial products. This interaction may result in the release of cytokines which are directly or indirectly involved in connective tissue and bone catabolism, such as interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8. Our investigation has tested the hypothesis that HGF from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa)-infected patients with rapidly destructive forms of periodontitis, such as localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP), respond to Aa challenge with an exaggerated secretion of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8. We have compared the in vitro profiles of these cytokines by Aa-challenged HGF obtained from 2 healthy subjects, 2 Aa-infected, slowly progressing adult periodontitis (AP) patients and 2 LJP patients. HGF were challenged throughout a 48-hour period with formalinized whole bacterial cells, and culture supernatants were analyzed for cytokine content using RIA. No differences were noted in the IL-1 beta secretion levels among the different HGF cultures. Although basal (unchallenged) IL-6 and IL-8 production was similar in all HGF cultures, HGF from the two LJP patients responded to Aa challenge with a more rapid IL-6 and a more pronounced IL-8 secretion than healthy or AP HGF. We also tested the ability of human serum antibodies against Aa to moderate the Aa-elicited HGF cytokine secretion by adding human serum, with normal or elevated antibody content. Both sera appeared to have an upregulating effect on IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. Depletion of 95% of the anti-Aa antibody from serum by absorption did not affect its activity. Based on the response of HGF from two LJP patients, we propose that Aa-induced pathology in LJP may be modulated by stimulation of rapid and/or exaggerated secretion of cytokines with potential catabolic effects, although studies with a larger group of LJP patients are needed to further test this hypothesis. Furthermore, serum antibodies against this microorganism do not appear to have a neutralizing effect in cytokine-eliciting HGF-Aa interactions.",M1
8853431,"Primary structure of rat <e>HGF</e> receptor and induced expression in glomerular mesangial cells.The c-met protooncogene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). It has been widely suggested that HGF and its receptor constitute a paracrine signaling system, in which mesenchymally derived cells produce ligand that binds to the receptor predominantly expressed on cells of epithelial origin. In this study, we have isolated and completely sequenced the entire coding region of c-met cDNA from the rat kidney. The nucleotide sequence of the rat c-met cDNA revealed that the HGF receptor is encoded within single open-reading frame as 190 kDa of a transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of 1,382 amino acids. Determination of c-met mRNA levels in various tissues revealed a widespread expression of c-met with the highest levels in kidney, lung, and liver. We found simultaneous induction of both HGF and its receptor gene expression by interleukin-6 (IL-6) in primary cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells. The expression of HGF and c-met was remarkably stimulated following incubation of rat mesangial cells with IL-6, in a time- and dose-dependent manner Our data suggest that autocrine action of HGF may be achieved in vivo through simultaneous induction of both HGF and its receptor expression in renal mesenchymal cells.",M1
8841895,"Prostaglandin E2 potentiates interleukin-1 beta induced interleukin-6 production by human gingival fibroblasts.Increased levels of cytokines and prostanoids have been detected in inflamed gingival tissue and may play an important role in periodontal pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that monocytic products, such as interleukin (IL)-1 beta, could stimulate IL-6 production by human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>). In this context, the production of local cytokines and inflammatory mediators could regulate the secretory capacity of resident gingival fibroblasts. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if PGE2 induced by IL-1 beta could potentiate the IL-6 response by HGF. Utilizing an ELISA, it was determined that maximal IL-6 occurred when HGF were stimulated with 0.10-10 nM IL-1 beta. These concentrations of IL-1 beta also induced a small, but significant increase in PGE2 production by HGF. Interestingly, the combination of IL gamma beta and PGE2 induced a synergistic rise in IL-6 production by HGF. Moreover, inclusion of indomethacin caused a 20% reduction in IL-6 production and totally eliminated PGE2 production. These findings provide additional rationale for the clinical use of NSAIDs in the management of periodontal disease due to their ability to attenuate production of both PGE2, and IL-6. These results suggest the endogenous PGE2 induced by IL-1 beta plays an important regulatory role in IL 6 production by HGF. Moreover, they support the concept that elevated PGE2induced during inflammation can regulate HGF secretory function.",M1
8735012,"Effect of in vitro passage of healthy human gingival fibroblasts on cellular morphology and cytokine expression.Cytokines have been implicated in the regulation of antibody and inflammatory responses, but their role in periodontal diseases has not been elucidated. In the present study, cytokine production by human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>) following in vitro passage was assessed in order to determine the basal levels of cytokine message and protein and to determine if the cellular morphology and the profile of cytokines produced differed with passage. The HGF cell line F-CL was established by explantation from non-inflamed gingival tissue, and cells from passages 1-10 were studied. The number of cells was determined in confluent cultures and cell morphology was examined by light microscopy. Fibroblasts from confluent cultures were examined for cytokine mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and culture supernatants were assessed for cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The morphology of F-CL fibroblasts in passages 1-4 was normal, while fibroblasts in passages 5-10 were larger. In general, the number of cells decreased from early to late passage. Fibroblasts from passages 1-10 contained message for interleukin-1 beta, -6 and -8, but not for interleukin-1 alpha or tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Interleukin-6 was detected in culture supernatants of F-CL fibroblasts by the enzyme immunoassay and its level decreased with increasing passage.",M1
8708945,"Production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines by human gingival fibroblasts following bacterial challenge.Bacteria can indirectly affect the course of periodontal diseases by activating host cells to produce and release inflammatory mediators and cytokines. These mediators and cytokines manifest potent proinflammatory and catabolic activity and may play key roles in local amplification of the immune response as well as in periodontal tissue breakdown. This study tested the effect of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and Campylobacter rectus (Cr) challenge on PGE2, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 production by human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>). Contact-inhibited HGF were prepared and formalin-killed bacterial cells (Aa JP2, ATCC 29523 &amp; 33384 and Cr ATCC 33238) at 10(6)-10(9) were added to the HGF. Culture supernatants were collected at varying time intervals and analyzed for cytokine and mediator content. All concentrations of Aa JP2 and Cr ATCC 33238 suppressed IL-1 beta production up to approximately 50% during the initial 3-12-h period. No bacterial concentration tested was able to increase IL-1 beta production above the maximum basal levels. Both bacterial species stimulated production of IL-6 and IL-8. Aa JP2 did not affect PGE2 levels significantly, whereas Cr ATCC 33238 was stimulatory only at the highest concentration tested (10(9)). There were no significant differences among the three Aa strains with respect to IL-1 beta production. However, Aa ATCC 29523 and ATCC 33384 were less capable of stimulating IL-6 secretion and more efficient in stimulating IL-8 production than Aa JP2. In general, Cr was the most potent enhancer of cytokine and mediator production by HGF. In conclusion, Aa and Cr are capable of amplifying the local immune response and promoting periodontal tissue inflammation by stimulating HGF to secrete mainly IL-6 and IL-8.",M1
11012221,"Hematopoietic differentiation of embryonic stem cells: an in vitro model to study gene regulation during megakaryocytopoiesis.We are interested in the regulation of the tissue specificity of the megakaryocyte-specific platelet glycoprotein IIb gene. The murine embryonic stem (ES) cells are able to differentiate into erythroid, mast and granulomonocytic cells in appropriate culture conditions. Our goal is to optimize the production of myeloid cells including megakaryocytes (MKs) by ES cells. We have found that coculture with MS-5 stromal cells and the presence of a cocktail of hematopoietic growth factors (<e>HGFs</e>) [stem cell factor, interleukin 3 (IL-3), IL-6, IL-11, G-CSF and erythropoietin] had a high synergistic activity on differentiation of ES cells into pure and MK-containing myeloid colonies from day 12 embryoid bodies. Thrombopoietin increased the number of MKs only when added to the HGF cocktail in the presence of MS-5 cells. Interestingly, many MKs exhibited a  hairy  appearance evocative of pseudopodial proplatelet formation. Expression of genes specific for the megakaryocytic lineage, GPIIb, PF4, mpl and GPIIIa, was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during differentiation of ES cells, and their relative time course was evaluated. This demonstrates that optimized culture conditions for the differentiation of ES cells into the MK lineage provide a useful tool for the study of the regulation of expression of genes during megakaryocytopoiesis.",M1
7782982,"Modulation by progesterone of interleukin-6 production by gingival fibroblasts.The gingivitis associated with pregnancy has been attributed to increased concentrations of circulating estrogen and/or progesterone. However, the mechanism by which these steroids increase gingival inflammation is not known. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine produced by many cell types including human gingival fibroblasts (<e>hGF</e>), is secreted in response to inflammatory challenges such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide and interleukin-1 (IL-1). This study tested the hypothesis that progesterone could modulate the local production of IL-6 by hGF. The effects of progesterone on IL-6 production were measured in vitro in serum-free, phenol red-free medium to eliminate possible effects of such medium additives. The concentration of IL-6 secreted into supernatant medium after a 24 hour challenge with IL-1 beta was estimated by radioimmunoassay. Total RNA from steroid-treated hGF was probed for IL-6 mRNA. In serum-free medium, progesterone dose-dependently and significantly (P &lt; 0.05) inhibited IL-6 production by hGF, as did the glucocorticoids hydrocortisone (HC) and dexamethasone. At progesterone concentrations common in late pregnancy, IL-6 production was reduced to levels 40 to 50% of control. In addition, mRNA was significantly down-regulated by progesterone and HC, at both basal levels and after IL-1 beta challenge. These results suggest that high levels of progesterone during pregnancy affect the development of localized inflammation by down-regulation of IL-6 production, rendering the gingiva less efficient at resisting the inflammatory challenges produced by bacteria.",M1
7535335,"The FLT3 ligand potently and directly stimulates the growth and expansion of primitive murine bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro: synergistic interactions with interleukin (IL) 11, IL-12, and other hematopoietic growth factors.The recently cloned murine flt3 ligand (FL) was studied for its ability to stimulate the growth of primitive (Lin-Sca-1+) and more committed (Lin-Sca-1-) murine bone marrow progenitor cells, alone and in combination with other hematopoietic growth factors (<e>HGFs</e>). Whereas FL was a weak proliferative stimulator alone, it potently synergized with a number of other HGFs, including all four colony-stimulating factor (CSF), interleukin (IL) 6, IL-11, IL-12, and stem cell factor (SCF), to promote the colony formation of Lin-Sca-1+, but not Lin-Sca-1- or erythroid progenitor cells. The synergistic activity of FL was concentration dependent, with maximum stimulation occurring at 250 ng/ml, and was observed when cells were plated at a concentration of one cell per culture, suggesting that its effects are directly mediated. 2 wk of treatment with FL in combination with IL-3 or SCF resulted in the production of a high proportion of mature myeloid cells (granulocytes and macrophages), whereas the combination of FL with G-CSF, IL-11, or IL-12 resulted predominantly in the formation of cells with an immature blast cell appearance. Accordingly, FL in combination with G-CSF or IL-11 expanded the number of progenitors more than 40-fold after 2 wk incubation. Thus, FL emerges as a potent synergistic HGF, that in combination with numerous other HGFs, can directly stimulate the proliferation, myeloid differentiation, and expansion of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells.",M1
7877083,"Prostaglandin E2 inhibits interleukin-6 release but not its transcription in human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with interleukin-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha.Inflammatory mediators produced by human gingival fibroblasts (<e>HGF</e>) have been implicated in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease. The purpose of this study was to examine whether prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is produced in abundance from HGF after stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), could regulate IL-6 production by HGF. HGF stimulated with either IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha showed a rapid and dose-dependent increase in IL-6 mRNA accumulation and IL-6 secretion, as demonstrated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and bioassay. IL-6 secretion from either IL-1 beta- or TNF-alpha-stimulated HGF was enhanced by the inhibition of PGE2 synthesis with indomethacin. Furthermore, the addition of PGE2 inhibited IL-6 secretion from these cells. In contrast, indomethacin or PGE2 did not affect the accumulation of IL-6 mRNA in IL-1 beta-stimulated HGF. These data indicate that IL-6 production by HGF is up-regulated by specific cytokines, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, and suggest that this production may be partially down-regulated by endogenous and exogenous PGE2 at the post-transcriptional level.",M1
7515232,"Rat contrapsins are the type II acute phase proteins: regulation by interleukin 6 on the mRNA level.Three highly homologous serine protease inhibitors, SPI-1, SPI-2 and SPI-3 (contrapsins), are synthesized in rat liver. Their expression is regulated differently in healthy and inflamed animals. We found that interleukin 6 (IL-6), a major acute phase cytokine, and to a lesser extent leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), both together with glucocorticoids, are responsible for the regulation of expression of the contrapsins in rat hepatocytes in primary culture. The effect of IL-6 is time- and dose-dependent. IL-1, TGF beta 1, <e>HGF</e>, PMA and IL-8 did not have any effect on contrapsin mRNA levels. We postulate that SPI-1, SPI-2 and SPI-3 belong to the class II acute phase proteins. Additionally, we show induction of SPI-3 mRNA in rat liver by in situ hybridization using a specific oligonucleotide probe.",M1
7515265,"Endogenous haemopoietic growth factors in neutropenia and infection.Haemopoietic growth factors (<e>HGFs</e>) are being administered to patients with neutropenic fever; however, little is known about the endogenous HGF response in these patients. Specific assays were used to study four HGFs, granulocyte (G-) CSF, granulocyte-macrophage (GM-) CSF, macrophage (M-) CSF and interleukin (IL-) 6 levels in the blood of patients with neutropenic fever (46 episodes). For comparison, levels were also measured in three control populations: normals (20), afebrile neutropenic (14), and bacteraemic but not neutropenic patients (20). In febrile patients, levels of G-CSF (median, range) (0.46, &lt; 0.10-142 ng/ml). IL-6 (0.054, 0.005-24.3 ng/ml) and M-CSF (18.5, 9.9-79.1 ng/ml) were elevated compared with afebrile subjects (&lt; 0.10, &lt; 0.10-1.62 ng/ml). (0.008, 0.002-0.024 ng/ml) and (6.45, &lt; 5.0-31.3 ng/ml) respectively. GM-CSF was not elevated (&lt; 0.02, &lt; 0.02-8.0 ng/ml) compared with afebrile subjects (0.021, &lt; 0.02-0.20 ng/ml). Variables significantly associated (P &lt; 0.05) with elevated cytokine levels were determined by multiple regression analyses. Factors associated with G-CSF elevation were fever, neutropenia, pathogen type and raised bilirubin and creatinine. In contrast, neutropenia was not associated with IL-6 elevation although there was an association between IL-6 elevation and fever, Gram-negative and fungal infections and raised creatinine and bilirubin. M-CSF elevation was associated with fever, renal impairment and known pathogen. Elevated G-CSF and IL-6 levels normalized rapidly (hours-days) with the resolution of infection, whereas M-CSF concentrations remained elevated for up to 10 d. Cytokine levels remained elevated in septic neutropenic patients who did not recover. In summary, G-CSF, IL-6 and M-CSF levels were significantly elevated in sepsis. In contrast, GM-CSF levels were not elevated. These studies should assist the development of therapeutic strategies using HGFs in the treatment of sepsis.",M1
7678814,"Hematopoietic growth factors and glucocorticoids synergize to mimic the effects of IL-1 on granulocyte differentiation and IL-1 receptor induction on bone marrow cells in vivo.The mechanisms by which interleukin-1 (IL-1) stimulates hematopoiesis are not clear. We have previously shown that in vivo administration of IL-1 indirectly increases IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) expression on both immature and mature bone marrow (BM) cells, partly due to IL-1-induced hematopoietic growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) production. Because IL-1 also stimulates the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis resulting in the production of glucocorticoids (GC), we assessed whether in vivo treatment with HGF and glucocorticoids upregulates IL-1R. Administration of IL-1 to adrenalectomized mice reduces by 53% IL-specific binding on light density bone marrow (LDBM) cells compared to sham-operated mice. The administration of dexamethasone (dex) alone induced only a slight increase in IL-1R expression but synergized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), IL-3 and IL-6 to upregulate IL-1R expression. Flow cytometry analysis using the RB6-8C5 antibody, which is differentially expressed on myeloid cells, indicated that combined G-CSF and dex treatment acts to promote increased numbers of differentiated myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow. Autoradiographic analysis confirmed that while G-CSF and dex increased IL-1R expression on all myeloid cells, it was particularly pronounced for myelocytes, promyelocytes and metamyelocytes. These results suggest that the ability of IL-1 to enhance granulocyte differentiation in vivo is partly due to its ability to induce a cascade of cytokines and steroids which in turn regulate IL-1 receptor expression.",M1
8431556,"The effects of hybridoma growth factor in conditioned media upon the growth, cloning, and antibody production of heterohybridoma cell lines.Interleukin 6 (IL-6)/hybridoma growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) has been shown to be the requirement for growth of murine hybridomas in vivo or in vitro. In this paper, two kinds of conditioned media (CM) from the culture supernatants of a human fibroblast cell line CRL1506 and a cloned Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed human lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) N23 were found to have IL-6 activity by strongly promoting the growth, antibody secretion (increase of one- to three-fold), and cloning efficiencies of heterohybridomas secreting human monoclonal anti-hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome virus antibodies and LCL. Since these CM contained no detectable IL-2, and IL-4 had no effects on the growth of the cell lines, IL-6 was considered to be the main active component of the CM responsible for promoting hybridoma growth. This effect was further confirmed by IL-6-dependent cell line 7TD1 bioassay (IL-6 activity in the CM ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 units/ml). Moreover, we successfully established four EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines at single-cell level by adding an equal volume of CRL1506-CM to 10% FCS-RPMI1640 in limiting dilution. Finally, it is worth noting that the sensitivity of the heterohybridomas to the two kinds of CM was not the same and was not consistent with that of their parental myeloma cell lines. Thus, it suggests that the CM might contain more than one factor, and the choice of proper conditioned media should be very useful for human monoclonal antibody production.",M1
1281784,"Retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer into primitive human hematopoietic progenitor cells: effects of mast cell growth factor (MGF) combined with other cytokines.Retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer into human hematopoietic stem cells may permit gene therapy of numerous genetic diseases. Stimulation of marrow with hematopoietic growth factors (<e>HGFs</e>) has been shown to increase the level of retroviral transduction. We have examined the effects of recombinant human mast cell growth factor (MGF), alone and in combination with other HGFs, on the efficiency of gene transfer into human hematopoietic progenitor cells. MGF acts in concert with interleukin 3 (IL-3) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) to increase the percentage of CD34+ progenitors transduced with a retroviral vector expressing the neo gene. The most potent combination of growth factors that we examined, interleukin 1 (IL-1)/IL-3/IL-6/MGF, resulted in the conferral of G418 resistance to 45% of progenitors and long-term culture-initiating cells. Extending the time of cocultivation of the marrow cells with the vector-producing cells did not further increase gene transfer frequency, suggesting that the amount of available vector is not limiting. To analyze the effects of the HGF on gene transfer into more primitive hematopoietic progenitors, CD34+ cells were isolated from marrow samples that were purged of committed progenitor cells by treatment with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC). Preculturing the CD34+ 4-HC-treated cells with the combination of four HGF (IL-1/IL-3/IL-6/MGF) permitted transduction of 20%-28% of the progenitors that formed colonies after 30 days in culture. These results demonstrate that MGF in combination with other HGFs enhances gene transduction of human hematopoietic progenitor cells.",M1

During active disease, but not during remission, serum IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in patients with polyarticular (p &lt; 0.0001 vs controls) and in patients with pauciarticular JCA (p &lt; 0.01 vs controls). In patients with active polyarticular disease (polyarticular and extended pauciarticular) serum IL-6 levels correlated with the extent and severity of joint involvement (p &lt; 0.05), with erythrocyte sedimentation rate values (p &lt; 0.005) and with C reactive protein concentrations (p &lt; 0.05). In patients with persistent pauciarticular JCA, serum IL-6 levels correlated with the joint swelling score (p &lt; 0.05). Synovial fluid IL-6 levels, measured in 5 patients with pauciarticular JCA, were markedly elevated (range 600-24,000 <e>HGF</e> U/ml). In conclusion, our data suggest that IL-6 is an important pathogenic mediator in polyarticular and pauciarticular JCA.",M1
1381237,"Bone marrow stromal fibroblasts secrete interleukin-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the absence of inflammatory stimulation: demonstration by serum-free bioassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.Bone marrow (BM) stromal fibroblasts produce hematopoietic growth factors (<e>HGFs</e>) in response to inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha). In the absence of such inflammatory stimuli, production of HGFs by BM stromal cells has been problematic and controversial. In vivo, however, basal hematopoiesis maintains blood counts within a normal homeostatic range even in the absence of inflammation, and HGFs are required for progenitor cell differentiation in vitro. To better ascertain the contribution of BM stromal fibroblasts to basal hematopoiesis, we therefore studied HGF production in quiescent BM stromal fibroblasts by three sensitive assays: serum-free bioassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Stromal fibroblasts were cultured in the presence or absence of normal human serum to determine if serum factor(s) present in the noninflammatory (basal) state induce secretion of HGFs. Human serum was found to induce or enhance transcription and secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and enhance secretion of constitutively expressed IL-6. In contrast, no secretion of either granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) or IL-3 was found. These data indicate that factors in normal human serum are active in enhancing GM-CSF and IL-6 production by stromal fibroblasts and suggest that these growth factors contribute to the maintainance of normal, basal hematopoiesis in vivo.",M1
1379087,"Induction of colony-stimulating factor receptor expression on hematopoietic progenitor cells: proposed mechanism for growth factor synergism.In many cells systems, the cellular interaction between two or more humoral factors leads to a synergistic response in terms of cellular growth and function. In particular, the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells involves numerous synergistic interactions between colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) that individually stimulate hematopoiesis (granulocyte-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, and interleukin-3 [IL-3]), as well as between these factors and other cytokines that individually have no proliferative effect on progenitor cell growth (IL-1 and IL-6). The present study investigated whether hematopoietic growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) synergy could be mediated by upregulation of CSF receptors. Synergistic effects on bone marrow (BM) progenitor cell colony formation, regardless of the combination of factors used, were consistently preceded by increased CSF receptor expression on highly enriched BM progenitor cells, but not on unfractionated BM cells. Induction of CSF receptors preceded detectable differentiation and did not require cell division because nocodazole, an inhibitor of mitosis, blocked CSF-mediated cell proliferation, but not receptor upregulation. Furthermore, combinations of cytokines that did not synergize also failed to affect the level of CSF receptors on BM progenitors. These results have led us to propose a model for HGF synergy whereby one mechanism of action the investigated synergistic cytokines might be the ability to induce increased expression of CSF receptors.",M1

Among them, 44 cases were in their early stage of disease, 66 in their intermediate stage, and 12 in their advanced stage. They were treated by basic therapy with hepatic cell growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) added to some of them. The patients were divided into two groups, one receiving treatment of blood-cooling and detoxifying Chinese herbs, the other receiving treatment of heat-clearing and detoxifying Chinese herbs. The treatment was effective for 52 cases, and ineffective in 70 cases. Values of serum bilirubin (SB) and prothrombin activity (PA) and the time of initial consultation had marked influence on their prognoses. No difference was found in total mortality between the two groups, also no difference was found in mortality between the former and latter group with or without the addition of HGF at the early stage of disease. The survival rate of the former group was significantly higher than that of the latter one with HGF added at their intermediate stage of disease, which were 60% and 14.7% respectively, P less than 0.01. The conclusion is that as diagnosis and treatment were based on the Syndrome Differentiation of patients at intermediate stage of disease, Chinese herbs will be effective in many ways such as lowering and eliminating jaundice, improving symptoms and signs, preventing and curing complications, curing coexisting diseases, and repairing pathological lesions.",M1
1879464,"Marked stimulation of growth and motility of human keratinocytes by hepatocyte growth factor.Effect of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) on normal human epidermal keratinocytes cultured under conditions of low Ca2+ (0.1 mM, growth-promoting condition) and physiological Ca2+ (1.8 mM, differentiation-promoting condition) was investigated. In low Ca2+, HGF markedly enhanced the migration of keratinocytes while it suppressed cell growth and DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, HGF enhanced the migration, cell growth, and DNA synthesis of keratinocytes cultured under conditions of physiological Ca2+. The maximal stimulation of DNA synthesis (2.4-fold stimulation) in physiological Ca2+ was seen at 2.5-5 ng/ml HGF and the stimulatory effect of HGF was suppressed by transforming growth factor-beta 1. Analysis of the HGF receptor using 125I-HGF as a ligand showed that human keratinocytes expressed a single class of specific, saturable receptor for HGF in both low and physiological Ca2+ conditions, exhibiting a Kd = 17.3 pM and approximately 690 binding sites/cell under physiological Ca2+. Thus, HGF is a potent factor which enhances growth and migration of normal human keratinocytes under conditions of physiological Ca2+. HGF may play an important role in epidermal tissue repair as it enhances both the migration and growth of keratinocytes.",M1

Mutant proteins were produced by in vitro transcription-translation or in Escherichia coli and tested for their biological activity using the hybridoma growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) assay or a transcriptional activation assay on human hepatoma cells. The folding of the mutants was also checked by immunoprecipitation with conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies.

All those deletion-carrying hIL-6 (delta hIL-6) proteins were then produced in Xenopus laevis oocytes and examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The results show that, at least in frog oocytes, the first potential N-glycosylation site (Asn45) is utilized exclusively. The IL-6 conformation of these deletion-carrying proteins has been studied by immunoprecipitation with two kinds of monoclonal antibodies (mAb's): mAb's that show preference towards denatured hIL-6, or conformation-specific mAb's. The binding pattern of these two series of mAb's indicated that the IL-6 conformation has been largely destroyed for four of our delta-proteins. Proteins delta 21-51 and delta 127-174 have kept a part of the IL-6 tertiary structure since they are still recognized by some conformation-specific mAb's. All of these delta hIL-6 proteins were inactive in the IL-6 hybridoma growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) assay and unable to inhibit the HGF activity of the recombinant human wild-type IL-6 (wt hIL-6). Moreover, the oocyte-synthesized delta hIL-6 (delta 21-51, delta 127-174, delta 97-184, delta 134-184) did not bind to the IL-6 receptor.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Poly A-U on IL-6 production by this cell type. After incubation for 48 h at 37 degrees C of confluent (1 week old) L 929 fibroblasts in the presence or in the absence of Poly A-U, IL-6-like activity in supernatants was measured by the proliferation assay of the IL-6-dependent B cell hybridoma cell line, 7TD1. Poly A-U increased IL-6 activity in supernatants in a dose-dependent manner at doses higher than 50 micrograms/ml, the maximum activity being observed at the highest concentration of Poly A-U used, i.e. 500 micrograms/ml. beta Interleukin-1 (beta IL-1) and poly-cytidylic-polyinosinic (Poly I-C) have been shown to be inducers of IL-6 in fibroblast culture and thus their effect was compared to that of Poly A-U. The IL-6 activity in supernatants induced by 500 micrograms/ml Poly I-C (58.4 +/- 16.4 U/ml; n = 4) was higher than that evoked by 100 U/ml beta IL-1 (5.7 +/- 0.4 U/ml) or 500 micrograms/ml Poly A-U (39.6 +/- 7.8 U/ml). The increased production of IL-6 by Poly A-U may explain part of its previously reported immunomodulatory effects.",M1
1793760,"IL-6 production by retrovirus packaging cells and cultured bone marrow cells.Retrovirus integration into the host cell genome occurs most efficiently in replicating cells. In agreement with this notion, it was observed that the efficiency with which hemopoietic stem cells (HSC) can be transduced is greatly enhanced when the hemopoietic growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) interleukin 3 (IL-3) is added to co-cultures of bone marrow cells with retrovirus-producing cells. The HGF IL-6, which enhances the IL-3-induced formation of blast cell colonies in vitro, is also believed to improve the transduction of HSC. Because IL-6 can be produced by a number of different cell types, we investigated whether IL-6 was present in the culture supernatant of retrovirus packaging cells and bone marrow cells. We found that the six retrovirus packaging cells tested produced large amounts of IL-6. Bone marrow cells cultured with IL-1 alpha and IL-3 also make IL-6, and, following co-cultivation of both cell types, the concentration of IL-6 in the medium is even up to 10-fold higher than the sum of the concentrations obtained when both are cultured separately. Considering that IL-6 is produced in large amounts during co-cultivations, we believe that its effect on the transduction of HSC cannot be measured by adding extra growth factor to the co-culture medium.",M1

2081193,"Comparison of the effects of growth factors on retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer and the proliferative status of human hematopoietic progenitor cells.We have examined the ability of the recombinant hematopoietic growth factors (<e>HGF</e>) interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to increase retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer into human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). The efficiency of neo gene transfer by the N2 vector into human HPC was enhanced by preculture with either GM-CSF or IL-3 (but not IL-6) and with each combination of the three factors. The combination of IL-3 plus IL-6 consistently produced significantly higher levels of G418-resistant colonies (50-60%) than any of the other combinations of HGF tested. Following preculture with HGF and transduction by N2, marrow was maintained in long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) for 2 months. The levels of G418-resistant HPC remained stable, and no apparent depletion of total HPC content resulted from the prior exposure to highly stimulatory doses of factors. The proliferative status of the HPC, following exposure to the HGF, was measured as the percentage of HPC that were inhibited from forming colonies by exposure to the S-phase-specific drug, hydroxyurea. The ability of the different HGF to increase the rate of gene transfer by N2 correlated significantly with the extent to which they stimulated HPC proliferation. These results suggest that the mechanism by which HGF increase rates of gene transfer into HPC is by stimulating cell proliferation. Techniques that produce high rates of gene transfer into long-lived human HPC will facilitate studies to quantitate expression of exogenous genes in hematopoietic cells and may be applicable to clinical gene therapy.",M1
2692563,"Marked increase of <e>HGF</e> mRNA in non-parenchymal liver cells of rats treated with hepatotoxins.When experimental hepatitis was induced by administrating rats with hepatotoxins such as CCl4 and D-galactosamine, HGF mRNA increased dramatically in the injured liver. The increase of HGF mRNA was time- and dose-dependent. At 5 hr after CCl4-treatment, HGF mRNA was remarkably increased; it reached the maximum level at 10 hr and maintained at this level for 40 hr. On the contrary, in D-galactosamine-induced hepatitis, HGF mRNA started to increase from 24 hr after a long lag time. Moreover, HGF mRNA was expressed transiently, decreasing rapidly to the basal level after reaching the maximum level at 36 hr. The degree of induction of HGF mRNA correlates well to the degree of liver damage. In the liver, HGF mRNA could be detected in only non-parenchymal cells, not in parenchymal hepatocytes. These findings suggest that liver is a main producing organ of HGF for liver regeneration after hepatic injury, and HGF is synthesized and secreted by non-parenchymal liver cells so that it stimulates the growth of parenchymal hepatocytes to repair liver tissue in paracrine fashion.",M1
2480384,"T cell derived IL-6 is differentially required for antigen-specific antibody secretion by primary and secondary B cells.IL-6 (formerly PCTGF, HP-1, BSF-2, <e>HGF</e>, IFN-beta 2, 26 kDa) is a recently defined lymphokine demonstrating activity on multiple cell types, including hepatocytes, thymocytes, T cells, plasmacytomas, and B cells. The biologic effects of IL-6 on lymphocytes, particularly B cells, suggest this factor may be involved in the regulation of normal immune responses. Accordingly, we have investigated the role of IL-6 in Ag-specific responses of B cells from both naive and Ag-primed mice. When Ag-primed splenic T cells were used as a source of help, naive (primary) B cell responses specific for the hemagglutinin molecule of the influenza A virus (PR8) were fully inhibited by the addition of an anti-IL-6 antiserum, and are thus IL-6 dependent. In contrast, secondary B cell responses were essentially IL-6 independent, being unaffected by this antiserum even at concentrations 10-fold higher than required to completely inhibit primary responses. This differential IL-6 requirement was further investigated by using a panel of hemagglutinin molecule-specific Th clones. Consistent with the above findings, a Th1 clone secreting biologically active IL-6 enables antibody secretion by both primary and secondary B cells, whereas Th1 clones that do not produce IL-6 support secondary responses, but fail to help primary B cell responses unless exogenous IL-6 is added. These results provide the first instance of differential lymphokine requirements among primary vs secondary B cell responses, and suggest T cell-derived IL-6 plays a critical role during the regulation of humoral immune responses. Moreover, functionally distinct Th1 clones were identified that differed in IL-6 secretion and their corresponding ability to induce Ig secretion by primary and secondary B cells.",M1

The proliferative response of this B3B1 clone was IL-6-specific, and could not be promoted by other cytokines including IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The anti-human B-cell stimulatory factor 2 (BSF-2)/IL-6 antiserum did not neutralize feline HGF/IL-6 activity in conditioned media prepared from feline con A-stimulated splenocytes and unstimulated alveolar macrophages, indicating antigenic differences between species. Feline HGF/IL-6 was eluted into the fractions corresponding to a molecular weight of 30,000-40,000 in gel filtration, and into the fractions at a salt concentration of 0.2-0.3 M NaCl in anion exchange chromatography.

2583859,"IL-1 and IL-6 release by tumor-associated macrophages from human ovarian carcinoma.Our study was designed to investigate the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) isolated from ascites (18 cases) or solid (7 cases) human ovarian carcinoma. These are pleiotropic monokines which, in addition to affecting proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes, act on various targets, including vascular cells and liver, and may therefore be involved in the pathogenesis of certain manifestations of malignancy. IL-1 was measured by the thymocyte co-stimulator assay, under conditions in which IL-6 was inactive, and, in 8 cases, by radioimmunoassay (RIA). IL-6 was measured as hybridoma growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) on the 7TD1 cell line. TAM did not release appreciable levels of IL-1 spontaneously and, upon LPS stimulation, were poor producers of this monokine compared to blood monocytes. In contrast, TAM supernatants contained a high level of HGF in the absence of deliberate stimulation, and exposure to LPS either did not affect or further augmented production of this monokine. HGF activity of TAM supernatants was completely blocked by anti-IL-6 antibodies. Ascites fluid from 8 ovarian-carcinoma patients contained high levels of HGF activity, blocked by anti-IL-6 antibodies. Thus, TAM exhibit a dissociation in their capacity to release the functionally related monokines IL-1 and IL-6. IL-6 produced by TAM may account for the elevation of liver-derived acute-phase proteins associated with malignancy.",M1

This protein was purified from bacterial extracts by chromatography on rabbit IgG-Sepharose columns. After six injections of the purified protein into mice, sera were tested for their binding titer in a solid phase radioimmunassay (sRIA) and for the specificity of binding by Western blots. In the sRIA, crude supernatants of CHO cells (harboring a plasmid containing the human IL-6 gene and expressing high levels of IL-6 but no protein-A or any bacterial antigen) were bound to a solid support, reacted with supernatants of the hybridomas and finally detected with [125I]-goat anti-mouse antibodies. Spleen cells derived from a mouse showing the highest binding titer were fused to mouse myeloma cells. The hybridomas were screened by the sRIA and several positive clones were isolated and characterized.

2681453,"[Growth and differentiation of neonatal rat hepatocytes in primary culture]Liver plays a central role in metabolism of the body and it regenerates actively after injury. Primary cultured hepatocytes are suitable for studies on its growth and complex functions, because these cells mimic many liver functions and respond well to various hormones just like hepatocytes in vivo. Adult hepatocytes in culture are quiescent, but they proliferate in the presence of appropriate mitogens. Rat platelets contain a hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) and growth inhibitors. This HGF was found to be a labile protein of 100 kDa consisting of subunits of 34 and 69 kDa. One inhibitory factor, identified as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, shown to be released from platelets in a latent form and to be activated by its dissociation from bound masking proteins. Interleukin (IL)-1 and -6 also inhibit growth of hepatocytes. Besides these humoral factors, we found that the cell density in culture is an important regulatory factor for hepatocyte growth; a high cell density suppresses cell growth and promotes expression of differentiated liver functions. The roles of these humoral and membranous factors in the mechanism of liver regeneration are discussed. In contrast, neonatal hepatocytes in culture can grow autonomously without an added mitogen and they secrete several growth factors into the medium. This autocrine growth ceases rapidly after birth and differentiated characters appear in neonatal hepatocytes in culture. This change from growth to differentiation of immature hepatocytes can be stimulated by contact of the cells with adult hepatocytes. Therefore, micro-architecture of surroundings of hepatocytes is very important for regulation of liver functions and growth of not only adult hepatocytes, but also neonatal hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1

Intravenous administration of human rhTNF-alpha, rhIL-1, rhIL-2, rhIFN-alpha A/D, and rmIFN-gamma were all capable of inducing circulating IL-6. rhTNF-alpha administration caused the greatest induction of IL-6. TB animals consistently produced more IL-6 in response to rhTNF-alpha than did normal mice (2 h after 4 micrograms rhTNF-alpha, TB = 24,100 <e>HGF</e> U/ml, non-TB = 3600 HGF U/ml of IL-6). A single daily i.v. dose of rhTNF-alpha (4 micrograms/mouse/day) for 5 days led to decreased IL-6 induction in TB animals by day 3 of treatment (peak levels of IL-6, day 1 = 72,800 HGF U/ml, day 3 = 23,400 HGF U/ml, day 5 = 26,400 HGF U/ml). rhIL-1 administration also resulted in considerable IL-6 production, although peak values were less than those resulting from administration of rhTNF-alpha. Administration of rhIL-1 induced similar IL-6 levels (TB = 10,025 and non-TB = 10,600 HGF U/ml) in TB and normal mice. Single high doses of rhIL-2, rhIFN-alpha A/D, and rmIFN-gamma induced lower but consistent levels of circulating IL-6 in mice with and without tumor. In addition, the sera of untreated TB mice contained levels of IL-6 which paralleled the extent of tumor burden (serum IL-6 in day 30 MCA 106 TB mice = 420 HGF U/ml). The detection of de novo IL-6 was also confirmed in animals bearing tumors of different histologies (the MCA 102 sarcoma, MCA 38 adenocarcinoma, and B16 melanoma). At no time was IL-6 measurable in the sera of untreated normal mice. The identification of IL-6 was verified by neutralization studies using specific antimurine IL-6 antibody.

We have compared in several fusion experiments the stimulatory effects of HGF both on the yield of hybridomas and on the number of antibody-secreting hybridomas. The results obtained clearly showed that while the stimulatory effect of HGF on the yield of growth-positive wells was variable and sometimes barely detectable, the proportion of growth-positive wells containing monoclonal antibodies was consistently much higher in the HGF-containing cultures. These results suggest that the majority of the antibody-secreting newly formed hybridomas are sensitive to HGF and indicate that HGF is a very useful culture supplement for the generation of a high number of antibody-producing hybridomas even if it may not increase significantly the yield of viable hybridomas.",M1

IL-6 was measured as hybridoma growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) on the 7TD1 cell line in the supernatants of human endothelial cells (HEC). HEC released appreciable levels of HGF activity in the absence of deliberate stimulation. In vitro exposure to recombinant IL-1 beta markedly increased (usually 10 to 15-fold) HGF production by HEC. Optimal stimulation was observed with 0.1 to 50 U/ml for 4 to 20 h of incubation. Human and murine rIL-1 alpha stimulated HGF production in HEC. Anti-IL-6 antibodies inhibited the HGF activity of the HEC supernatants, thus confirming, together with the cytokine specificity of the assay, the nature of HEC-produced cytokine. IL-1-treated HEC expressed high levels of IL-6 mRNA as detected by Northern blot analysis. Inasmuch as IL-1 elicits a complex series of changes in HEC, it was important to assess whether IL-6, produced after exposure to IL-1, modified HEC function. Natural or rIL-6 did not affect the functional status of HEC as assessed by proliferative capacity, production of procoagulant activity and prostacyclin, ability to induce adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The capacity to produce IL-6 may represent an important mechanism by which endothelial cells participate in inflammatory and immune reactions.",M1

In a prospective study the biological significance of IL-6, but also the relationship with the acute phase response (C-reactive protein [CRP], alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein) during flare-ups in 12 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients was investigated. Only 2 SLE patients showed sustained elevated IL-6 levels, and in one of these patients a clear correlation was found between the increases in IL-6 and the acute phase response. In the other SLE patients hardly any response or change in the levels of IL-6, CRP, and/or alpha 1-antitrypsin was found. In contrast to the profiles of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, in seven of the SLE patients a significant increase in the serum levels took place in the period preceding the exacerbation. This difference between the three acute phase proteins suggests that the regulatory mechanisms are different. Our results are in agreement with the findings that IL-6 might be responsible for the CRP response.",M1
3264498,"Appearance of hybridoma growth factor/interleukin-6 in the serum of mice bearing a methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma.Serum concentrations of hybridoma growth factor/interleukin-6 progressively increased in mice bearing a transplantable methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma with tumor growth. Elevated <e>HGF</e>/interleukin-6 concentrations were also positively correlated with increased serum concentrations of the hepatic acute phase reactant protein, amyloid P. Daily Indomethacin treatment of sarcoma-bearing mice prolonged survival and reduced the magnitude of the serum amyloid P response, but failed to attenuate either tumor growth or serum HGF/interleukin-6 responses. Since previous studies have demonstrated that neither interleukin-1 nor tumor necrosis factor-alpha can be detected in the serum of these sarcoma-bearing mice, and that HGF/interleukin-6 is a principal mediator of the hepatic acute phase response, we conclude that circulating HGF/interleukin-6 may contribute significantly to the host responses which accompany experimentally-introduced cancer. Furthermore, prostanoid inhibition does not appear to regulate the synthesis and release of HGF/interleukin-6 during tumor growth.",M1

3138137,"Interleukin 6, the third mediator of acute-phase reaction, modulates hepatic protein synthesis in human and mouse. Comparison with interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.Interleukin 6 (IL6) is the new definition of a group of cytokines previously named according to their biological activity, e.g. B cell stimulatory factor 2 (BSF-2), hybridoma plasmocytoma-growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), interferon-beta 2 (IFN-beta 2), hepatocyte stimulating factor (HSF). It has recently been suggested that IL6 may represent the major mediator of acute-phase protein response whereas IL1 beta and TNF-alpha could play a minor role. We compared the effect of the three cytokines on hepatic protein synthesis by performing in vitro as well as in vivo experiments. Human hepatoma cells (PLC/PRF5) were exposed to each cytokine separately for 20 h, and the effect was then studied at the protein and RNA level. All three cytokines reduced albumin and increased C3 and ceruloplasmin biosynthesis. The cytokines induced the same effect at the RNA level indicating that the modulation was pretranslational. The effect of the cytokines was specific since actin gene expression was not changed; furthermore the effect was blocked by specific antibodies against the cytokines. The effect of the single cytokines was dose and time dependent, and quantitatively comparable. None of the cytokines was able to alter alpha 1-anti-trypsin synthesis. In vivo experiments with mice showed that IL1 beta and TNF-alpha both induce serum amyloid A (SAA) mRNA in the mouse liver and increase factor B (Bf) gene expression. Human recombinant IL6 induced SAA gene expression and it also had a weak positive effect on Bf gene expression after i.p. injection. These data demonstrate that the three cytokines studied are quantitatively and qualitatively comparable, and that all three are probably involved in acute-phase protein response.",M1

Proteins derived from this gene mediate the plasma protein response to tissue injury (acute-phase response) and regulate the growth and differentiation of both B and T cells. By using the enzymes MspI, BstNI, and BglI, three polymorphic systems were detected with probes for the IFNB2 gene. The MspI and BglI polymorphisms are likely to be due to base pair substitutions; the BstNI polymorphism was revealed by nine other enzymes and is likely to be due to DNA insertions within 1 kb of the 3' flanking region of the gene. This region is rich in AT dinucleotides, and slippage at DNA replication may generate the insertions of between 0.07 and 0.23 kb that were observed. The polymorphic MspI site also lies within the vicinity of the fifth exon. The BglI polymorphic site is likely to lie in 5' flanking DNA. The three polymorphisms are separate, and a variety of haplotypes was observed. A low level of linkage disequilibrium exists between the MspI and the BglI alleles. MspI and BstNI polymorphisms were observed in Caucasoids, CAR Pygmies, Zaire Pygmies, Melanesians, and Chinese but at differing frequencies, and not all alleles were present in all populations. The BglI polymorphism was observed in Caucasoids and Africans only.

3279116,"Separation and comparison of two monokines with lymphocyte-activating factor activity: IL-1 beta and hybridoma growth factor (<e>HGF</e>). Identification of leukocyte-derived HGF as IL-6.Supernatants of mitogen-stimulated human leukocytes contain two biologically related cytokines, IL-1 and hybridoma growth factor (HGF). IL-1 beta is a potent inducer of HGF in fibroblasts but has little stimulating effect on monocytes that spontaneously produce HGF. Leukocyte-derived HGF and IL-1 were separated by the use of affinity chromatography on specific antibodies and discriminating assay systems for both cytokines. They had different Mr upon gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. In contrast to IL-1 beta, HGF showed heterogeneity on a cation-exchange column. IL-1 beta and HGF were purified to homogeneity by a sequence of four and five purification steps, respectively. Leukocyte-derived HGF was characterized by analysis of its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. This revealed complete homology with fibroblast-derived HGF, 26-kDa protein, IFN-beta 2, and B cell stimulatory factor 2, molecules which have collectively been designated as IL-6. IL-1 beta exerted an antiviral and growth-promoting effect of fibroblasts, whereas HGF/IL-6 did not. Both IL-1 and IL-6 possessed lymphocyte-activating factor activity, which could be neutralized only by an anti-serum against the corresponding cytokine.",M1

This factor, renamed interleukin-6 (IL-6), can be induced in fibroblasts by IL-1, while other cytokines are less active or inactive as inducers. The possible use of this IL-6 induction as an alternative indirect assay system for IL-1 is considered.

Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed that HGF is identical with interferon-beta 2, 26,000 protein, and B cell stimulatory factor-2. One of the active clones contained a cDNA that encoded a recombinant product lacking the 28-amino acid long signal peptide and the first 15 amino acids of the mature protein.

The purified HGF stimulated DNA synthesis of adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture at 1 ng/ml and was maximally effective at 5 ng/ml, being about twice as potent as EGF at this concentration. HGF did not stimulate DNA synthesis of Swiss 3T3 cells. It was found to be a heat- and acid-labile protein that was inactivated by reduction with dithiothreitol. The purified HGF had a molecular mass of 82 kDa, as estimated by SDS-PAGE, and was found to be a heterodimer which dissociated into a large subunit of 69 kDa and a small one of 34 kDa by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. These biological and chemical properties showed that HGF was not identical with any known growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).",M1

The availability of both a fast-growing and high-producer cell line (MG-63 osteosarcoma cells) and of a highly sensitive and specific assay system for this hybridoma growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) allowed us to obtain analytically pure preparations. Crude HGF from MG-63 cells was processed through a five-step concentration and purification schedule. Sequential adsorption to controlled pore glass (CPG) beads, antibody affinity chromatography and gel filtration resulted in a 10,000-fold purification to a specific activity of 10(9) units/mg HGF. Electrophoretically pure HGF was obtained after additional purification by cation-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC. The purification procedure revealed two distinct biologically active HGF components. The amino-terminal sequence of one of the two components was determined and found to correspond to that already predicted from cDNA clones of a protein alternatively called 26-kDa protein, interferon-beta 2 (IFN-beta 2) or B-cell stimulating factor-2 (BSF-2). The first two designations (26-kDa protein and IFN-beta 2) refer to a postulated fibroblast secretory protein with so far no unambiguously defined function; the latter designation (BSF-2) refers to a T-cell product possessing differentiation stimulatory effect on B-cell lines. The reported results firmly establish that the protein is secreted by fibroblasts and reveal that it possesses B-cell growth stimulatory activity.

Results obtained showed that the murine P388D1 cell-derived HGF has a m.w. of 29,000 and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.2 whereas the human monocyte-derived HGF has a m.w. of 34,000 and a pI of 4.9. The HGF activity was not mediated by interleukin 1 because the two activities could be completely separated by gel filtration. Results obtained in in vivo experiments showed that HGF-sensitive cells are tumorigenic in mice. The finding that the HGF biochemical parameters (m.w. and pI) are similar to the ones of a recently described plasmacytoma growth factor suggests that HGF and the plasmacytoma growth factor are similar and that the HGF sensitivity of SP 2/O myeloma cells is reactivated after fusion with normal B lymphocytes.",M1

HGF was clearly distinguishable from the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) by fast protein liquid chromatography. HGF was a heat- and acid-labile cationic protein that was inactivated by reduction with dithiothreitol. Its molecular mass was estimated to be 27 kDa by NaDodSO4/PAGE and its amino acid composition was very different from that of PDGF. The purified HGF stimulated DNA synthesis in adult rat hepatocytes at 2 ng/ml and was maximally effective at 20 ng/ml; its effect was additive or synergistic with those of insulin and EGF, depending on their combinations. HGF did not stimulate DNA synthesis of Swiss 3T3 cells, while PDGF did not stimulate that of hepatocytes. Thus, HGF showed clearly different cell specificity from PDGF in its growth-promoting activities. These findings indicate that HGF is a growth factor in platelets for mature hepatocytes.",M1

20461686,"Hepatocyte growth factor in exhaled breath and BAL fluid in sarcoidosis.INTRODUCTION: Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) is a strong mitogen stimulating lung epithelial cell growth. Elevated levels of HGF have been reported in various biological materials of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and in patients recovering from pneumonia or pneumonectomy. Sarcoidosis may be complicated by lung fibrosis. Consequently, HGF could be considered a new biomarker identifying patients with a higher risk of lung fibrosis. The aim of the study was to verify whether: 1. HGF is measurable in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC); 2. HGF in BALF or EBC is impaired in sarcoidosis; and 3. HGF correlates with chosen activity and prognostic markers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-four EBC and 30 BALF of sarcoid patients, and 15 and 9 of healthy controls, respectively, were collected for the measurement of HGF using an ELISA test. RESULTS: HGF was detectable in 62% of EBC samples (56% sarcoidosis and 87% of controls) and in all the BALF samples. EBC and BALF concentrations were not different in comparison to the controls. Moreover, no correlation was found between EBC/BALF concentrations and radiological stage, lung function tests, duration of disease, number of relapses, BALF lymphocytes, serum ACE, or serum and urine calcium concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: HGF is detectable in BAL and EBC. However, it does not distinguish sarcoidosis patients from healthy subjects. The above, as well as the lack of correlations with various parameters of disease activity and severity rule out EBC/ /BALF HGF as a biomarker for sarcoidosis monitoring.",M2

Accurate prediction would help physicians distinguish patients with poor renal prognosis in whom further therapy is likely to be futile from those who are likely to have good renal prognosis. Proper stratification of patients with AKI is also critical to design clinical trials to target patients with poor prognosis. Unfortunately, current general clinical severity scores (APACHE, SOFA, etc.) and AKI-specific severity scores (Mehta's score, Liano's score, Chertow's score, etc.) are not the good predictors of renal recovery. Recent progress on the pathophysiology of renal injury and recovery is encouraging. Repopulation of surviving renal tubular epithelial cell with the assistance of certain renal epithelial cell and specific growth factors such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), epidermal growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor-1, etc., play a major role in the recovery process.

20422876,"Effect of hepatocyte growth factor on progression of liver metastasis in colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and a strategy to assess and control liver metastasis will be critical to control patient prognosis. To evaluate therapeutic approaches, the biological responses associated with hepatectomy were studied with a focus on hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>). METHODOLOGY: In 54 patients with metastatic liver tumors due to CRC, c-Met expression was estimated by western blotting from resected tissue specimens. Serum HGF levels were measured by an ELISA method and compared with other liver function serum factors.RESULTS: The preoperative serum level of HGF was found to be related to ICGR15, ALP, CHE and AST, but after hepatectomy, the change was not correlated with other liver function factors. From an evaluation of pre-operative liver condition using ICGR15, an increasing rate (post/pre) of AST, ALT, ALP and HGF was observed to be higher in cases with positive outcomes. In cases with normal pre-operative levels of serum HGF, the increasing rate (post/pre) of HGF after surgery was higher than in cases with abnormally high pre operative values (3.07 +/- 0.87 and 2.38 +/- 0.74, respectively; p = 0.0102). In cases where tumors recurred within 6 months (early recurrence cases), the c-Met value in tumor tissue was higher than in cases with no recurrence, even in cases where there was no tendency for an increasing rate of HGF. In addition, multiplying data serum HGF increasing rate by c-Met value in tissue was significantly higher in early recurrence cases than in cases with no recurrence, (3.96 +/- 0.62 and 3.00 +/- 1.16 respectively; p = 0.0135). A similar finding was also detected following curative operations involving multiple tumor resection (3.93 +/- 0.64 vs. 2.84 +/- 1.24 for early and no recurrence, respectively; p = 0.0147). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that cancer with high c-Met expression and under high level of its ligand, HGF, led to recurrence soon after hepatectomy, leading to unfavorable patient prognosis. If pathological or biochemical factors from resected specimens could help identify patients with a high risk of relapse, innovative adjuvant chemotherapy protocols could be initiated.",M2

We assessed the genetic association of polymorphisms in the met proto-oncogene (MET) gene with CRS. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control genetic association study. SETTING: Tertiary-care university hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 206 unrelated Canadian patients with CRS and 196 control subjects were enrolled. Subjects were genotyped for 33 polymorphisms in the MET gene. RESULTS: The allelic association analysis showed eight single nucleotide polymorphisms in the MET gene (rs38850, rs38855, rs38857, rs2237717, rs2402118, rs193688, rs1621, rs42336) with a statistically significant association with CRS. The rs38850 T allele showed the strongest association and the highest risk for CRS (P = 0.004; odds ratio 1.65, 95% confidence interval 1.18-2.32); the association did not reach statistical significance after adjustment for genomic control (P = 0.06). The haplotype TGG constructed of markers rs38850, rs38855, and rs38857 represented a risk haplotype, resulting in a P value of 0.003 that remained significant after correction for multiple testing (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that polymorphisms in the MET gene may play a role in the susceptibility to develop CRS. Study findings apply to patients with severe CRS unresponsive to surgery.",M2

Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is thought to transmit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) store depletion signals to the plasma membrane (PM), causing the opening of SOCCs in the PM. However, the relationship between HGF and STIM1 in endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) proliferation remains uncharacterized. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential involvement of STIM1 in HGF-induced EPC proliferation. For this purpose, we used cultured rat bone marrow-derived EPCs and found that HGF-induced EPC proliferation at low concentrations. Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) was elevated in HGF-treated EPCs, and the SOCC inhibitors 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and BTP-2 inhibited the HGF-induced proliferation response. Moreover, STIM1 mRNA and protein expression levels were increased in response to HGF stimulation and knockdown of STMI1 decreased SOCE and prevented HGF-induced EPC proliferation. In conclusion, our data suggest that HGF-induced EPC proliferation is mediated partly via activation of STIM1.",M2
20404034,"Changes in islet microvasculature following streptozotocin-induced beta-cell loss and subsequent replacement in the neonatal rat.Neonatal rats undergo considerable beta-cell regeneration after depletion with streptozotocin (STZ). Since the intraislet vasculature is necessary for both beta-cell growth and function, we examined changes in vascular morphology following STZ. Neonatal Wistar rats (4 days) were injected with 70 mg/kg STZ, or buffer, and were examined between days 4 and 40 postinjection. Animals receiving STZ were relatively hyperglycemic for eight days, but became normoglycemic subsequent to a partial recovery of beta-cell mass. However, glucose tolerance remained impaired. The intraislet area occupied by capillaries was significantly reduced by approximately 20% following STZ, mainly within the beta-cell-rich islet core, but had recovered by day 40. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was localized to beta-cells, and pancreatic VEGF mRNA levels in control animals showed a progressive increase between days 4 and 20. This rise was delayed following STZ, but by day 20 VEGF mRNA abundance exceeded that in control pancreas. Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) was localized to intraislet endothelial cells. Levels of HGF mRNA increased until day 16 in control rats, but subsequently declined to low levels. Following STZ, HGF mRNA had declined prematurely after day 12. Type IV collagen was localized to the extracellular matrix around the intraislet vasculature. The islet area immunopositive for collagen was significantly reduced at all times following STZ. Results indicate that there is a relative loss of intraislet vasculature following STZ, which may limit subsequent beta-cell regeneration through both local growth factor and extracellular matrix interactions.",M2
20402766,"Hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFA): a serine protease that links tissue injury to activation of hepatocyte growth factor.Growth factors are a group of proteins that regulate a wide variety of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, motility, adhesion, and apoptosis of target cells. They play crucial roles in the formation and maintenance of tissue architecture in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. Because aberrations in growth factor signaling often result in pathological conditions, the activities of growth factors are tightly controlled by extracellular and intracellular regulators. Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) is a mesenchymal cell-derived growth factor that affects various target cells, including epithelial and endothelial cells. HGF is synthesized and secreted as a latent form, and is proteolytically activated in response to tissue injury, thus participating in tissue regeneration and repair. Interestingly, HGF has a unique structural feature: it is homologous to plasminogen, a key enzyme in the fibrinolytic system. Elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of HGF activity has revealed that a blood coagulation factor XII-like serine protease, hepatocyte growth factor activator, efficiently converts HGF from the latent form to the active form. Hepatocyte growth factor activator itself is activated downstream of the blood coagulation cascade, and links tissue injury to activation of HGF. HGF thus has structural as well as functional relevance to the blood coagulation/fibrinolytic system.",M2
20357818,"<e>HGF</e>-promoted motility in primary human melanocytes depends on CD44v6 regulated via NF-kappa B, Egr-1, and C/EBP-beta.The regulation of CD44v6, a variant of the CD44 family of glycosylated adhesion molecules, through hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has implications for motility in primary human melanocytes. We show that exposure of primary human melanocytes to HGF results in an increase of CD44v6 expression. Immunostaining of melanocytic lesions revealed low cytoplasmic positivity of CD44v6 in some nevi but high membranous expression in primary cutaneous melanomas, and cutaneous and lymph node metastases. HGF-dependent CD44v6 regulation in melanocytes is NF-kappaB dependent because BAY 11-7082, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation, but not interference with the mitogen-activated protein kinase or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase cascade, antagonized HGF-induced CD44v6 expression. NF-kappaB-mediated transcriptional regulation of CD44v6 involves the transcription factors Egr-1 and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-beta (C/EBP-beta). In gel shift assays, the initial binding of p100/p52 NF-kappaB, C/EBP-beta, and Egr-1 to the CD44 promoter experienced reshuffling toward increased affinity of C/EBP-beta after HGF stimulation. A blocking antibody to CD44v6 decreased HGF-induced c-Met phosphorylation as well as enhanced random- and site-directed migration. Our data show that HGF-induced motility in primary human melanocytes depends on c-Met-CD44v6 interaction, and that HGF-enhanced CD44v6 expression is required for motility and transcriptional upregulation of CD44v6, presumably mediated through a complex comprising NF-kappaB/C/EBP-beta and Egr-1.",M2

The effects on both parameters of alternate-day intermittent hemodialysis and short-daily hemodialysis and high and low flux membranes were investigated in 41 patients treated by hemodialysis. Sixteen (39%) patients were anti-HCV positive and 11 (69%) had HCV RNA. Twenty-six patients were on alternate-day intermittent and 15 on short-daily hemodialysis. High flux membranes were used for 29 patients and low flux membranes for 12 patients. A decrease in HCV RNA was observed at the end of hemodialysis (8.6 x 10(5) +/- 1.1 x 10(6) IU/ml vs. 4.4 x 10(5) +/- 7.3 x 10(5) IU/ml, P = 0.003). The proportion of HCV RNA decrease was similar in patients dialyzed with both schedules and with both types of membranes. The HGF levels increased from 2,605.9 +/- 1,428.7 to &gt;8,000 pg/ml at 15 min. At the end of the session, the HGF levels decreased to 5,106.7 +/- 2,533.9 pg/ml. The HGF levels at the start of the next session were similar to those at baseline (2,680.0 +/- 1,209.3 pg/ml). The increase and dynamics of the HGF levels were similar in patient's hemodialyzed with both schedules and with both types of membranes. These results suggest that changes in HCV RNA and HGF levels during hemodialysis are not influenced by the schedule or type of membrane used.",M2
20332205,"Hepatocyte growth factor inhibits CNS autoimmunity by inducing tolerogenic dendritic cells and CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.Immune-mediated diseases of the CNS, such as multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), are characterized by the activation of antigen-presenting cells and the infiltration of autoreactive lymphocytes within the CNS, leading to demyelination, axonal damage, and neurological deficits. Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) is a pleiotropic factor known for both neuronal and oligodendrocytic protective properties. Here, we assess the effect of a selective overexpression of HGF by neurons in the CNS of C57BL/6 mice carrying an HGF transgene (HGF-Tg mice). EAE induced either by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide or by adoptive transfer of T cells was inhibited in HGF-Tg mice. Notably, the level of inflammatory cells infiltrating the CNS decreased, except for CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (T(reg)) cells, which increased. A strong T-helper cell type 2 cytokine bias was observed: IFN-gamma and IL-12p70 decreased in the spinal cord of HGF-Tg mice, whereas IL-4 and IL-10 increased. Antigen-specific response assays showed that HGF is a potent immunomodulatory factor that inhibits dendritic cell (DC) function along with differentiation of IL-10-producing T(reg) cells, a decrease in IL-17-producing T cells, and down-regulation of surface markers of T-cell activation. These effects were reversed fully when DC were pretreated with anti-cMet (HGF receptor) antibodies. Our results suggest that, by combining both potentially neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects, HGF is a promising candidate for the development of new treatments for immune-mediated demyelinating diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as multiple sclerosis.",M2

20303741,"Targeting the <e>HGF</e>/Met signalling pathway in cancer.Under normal conditions, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced Met tyrosine kinase (TK) activation is tightly regulated by paracrine ligand delivery, ligand activation at the target cell surface, and ligand activated receptor internalisation and degradation. Despite these controls, HGF/Met signalling contributes to oncogenesis and tumour progression in several cancers and promotes aggressive cellular invasiveness that is strongly linked to tumour metastasis. The prevalence of HGF/Met pathway activation in human malignancies has driven rapid growth in cancer drug development programmes. Pathway inhibitors can be divided broadly into biologicals and low molecular weight synthetic TK inhibitors; of these, the latter now outnumber all other inhibitor types. We review here the basic properties of HGF/Met pathway antagonists now in preclinical and clinical development as well as the latest clinical trial results. The main challenges facing the effective use of HGF/Met-targeted antagonists for cancer treatment include optimal patient selection, diagnostic and pharmacodynamic biomarker development, and the identification and testing of optimal therapy combinations. The wealth of basic information, analytical reagents and model systems available concerning HGF/Met oncogenic signalling will continue to be invaluable in meeting these challenges and moving expeditiously toward more effective disease control.",M2
20233866,"Cyr61 mediates hepatocyte growth factor-dependent tumor cell growth, migration, and Akt activation.Certain tumor cell responses to the growth factor-inducible early response gene product CCN1/Cyr61 overlap with those induced by the hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>)/c-Met signaling pathway. In this study, we investigate if Cyr61 is a downstream effector of HGF/c-Met pathway activation in human glioma cells. A semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of 112 human glioma and normal brain specimens showed that levels of tumor-associated Cyr61 protein correlate with tumor grade (P &lt; 0.001) and with c-Met protein expression (r(2) = 0.4791, P &lt; 0.0001). Purified HGF rapidly upregulated Cyr61 mRNA (peak at 30 minutes) and protein expression (peak at 2 hours) in HGF(-)/c-Met(+) human glioma cell lines via a transcription- and translation-dependent mechanism. Conversely, HGF/c-Met pathway inhibitors reduced Cyr61 expression in HGF(+)/c-Met(+) human glioma cell lines in vitro and in HGF(+)/c-Met(+) glioma xenografts. Targeting Cyr61 expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited HGF-induced cell migration (P &lt; 0.01) and cell growth (P &lt; 0.001) in vitro. The effect of Cyr61 on HGF-induced Akt pathway activation was also examined. Cyr61 siRNA had no effect on the early phase of HGF-induced Akt phosphorylation (Ser(473)) 30 minutes after stimulation with HGF. Cyr61 siRNA inhibited a second phase of Akt phosphorylation measured 12 hours after cell stimulation with HGF and also inhibited HGF-induced phosphorylation of the Akt target glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha. We treated preestablished subcutaneous glioma xenografts with Cyr61 siRNA or control siRNA by direct intratumoral delivery. Cyr61 siRNA inhibited Cyr61 expression and glioma xenograft growth by up to 40% in a dose-dependent manner (P &lt; 0.05). These results identify a Cyr61-dependent pathway by which c-Met activation mediates cell growth, cell migration, and long-lasting signaling events in glioma cell lines and possibly astroglial malignancies.",M2
20227401,"Protective effect of C-phycocyanin against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatocyte damage in vitro and in vivo.This study focused on the hepatoprotective activity of C-phycocyanin (C-PC) against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatocyte damage in vitro and in vivo. In in vitro study, human hepatocyte cell line L02 was used. C-PC showed its capability to reverse CCl(4)-induced L02 cells viability loss, alanine transaminase (ALT) leakage and morphological changes. C-PC also showed the following positive effects: prevent the CCl(4)-induced overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA); prevent changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity; and reduce glutathione (GSH) level. In vivo, C-PC showed its capability to decrease serum ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels in CCl(4)-induced liver damage in mice. The histological observations supported the results obtained from serum enzymes assays. C-PC also showed the following effects in mice liver: prevent the CCl(4)-induced MDA formation and GSH depletion; prevent SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity; and prevent the elevation of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) mRNAs. Both the in vitro and in vivo results suggested that C-PC was useful in protecting against CCl(4)-induced hepatocyte damage. One of the mechanisms is believed to be through C-PCs scavenging ability to protect the hepatocytes from free radicals damage induced by CCl(4). In addition, C-PC may be able to block inflammatory infiltration through its anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting TGF-beta1 and HGF expression.",M2
20206988,"The effects of controlled <e>HGF</e> delivery from an affinity-binding alginate biomaterial on angiogenesis and blood perfusion in a hindlimb ischemia model.Enhancing tissue self-repair through the use of active acellular biomaterials is one of the main goals of regenerative medicine. We now describe the features of an injectable alginate biomaterial designed to affinity-bind heparin-binding proteins and release them at a rate reflected by their association constant to alginate-sulfate. The interactions of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) with alginate-sulfate resulted in factor protection from proteolysis, as shown by mass spectroscopy analysis after trypsin digestion. When the HGF/alginate-sulfate bioconjugate was incorporated into alginate hydrogel, HGF release was sustained by a factor of 3, as compared to the release rate from non-modified hydrogel. The released factor retained activity, as shown by its induction of ERK1/2 activation and affording cytoprotection in rat neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures. In vivo, an injectable form of the affinity-binding alginate system extended by 10-fold, as compared to a saline-treated group, retention of HGF in myocardial tissue when delivered immediately after myocardial infarction. In a severe murine hindlimb ischemia model, HGF delivery from the affinity-binding system improved tissue blood perfusion and induced mature blood vessel network formation. The therapeutic efficacy of the affinity-binding system, as well as its ease of delivery by injection, provides a proof-of-concept for the potential use of this bioactive biomaterial strategy in cardiovascular repair.",M2
20206174,"Thrombocytopenia exacerbates cholestasis-induced liver fibrosis in mice.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Circulating platelet counts gradually decrease in parallel with progression of chronic liver disease. Thrombocytopenia is a common complication of advanced liver fibrosis and is thought to be a consequence of the destruction of circulating platelets that occurs during secondary portal hypertension or hypersplenism. It is not clear whether thrombocytopenia itself affects liver fibrosis. METHODS: Thrombocytopenic mice were generated by disruption of Bcl-xL, which regulates platelet life span, specifically in thrombocytes. Liver fibrosis was examined in thrombocytopenic mice upon bile duct ligation. Effect of platelets on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was investigated in vitro. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenic mice developed exacerbated liver fibrosis, with increased expression of type I collagen alpha1 and alpha2, during cholestasis. In vitro experiments revealed that, upon exposure to HSCs, platelets became activated, released hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), and then inhibited HSC expression of the type I collagen genes in a Met signal-dependent manner. In contrast to the wild-type mice, the thrombocytopenic mice did not accumulate hepatic platelets or phosphorylate Met in the liver following bile duct ligation. Administration of recombinant HGF to thrombocytopenic mice reduced liver fibrosis to the levels observed in wild-type mice and attenuated hepatic expression of the type I collagen genes. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytopenia exacerbates liver fibrosis; platelets have a previously unrecognized, antifibrotic role in suppressing type I collagen expression via the HGF-Met signaling pathway.",M2
20203323,"Hepatocyte growth factor and the risk of ischemic stroke developing among postmenopausal women: results from the Women's Health Initiative.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) is a potent angiogenic factor and may play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions, the underlying mechanism of cardiovascular disease. However, there have been no prospective studies examining the relationship between HGF levels and risk of stroke. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study (972 incident stroke cases and 1:1 age-matched and race-matched controls) to prospectively evaluate the association between plasma HGF and risk of ischemic stroke within the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, a cohort of postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years. RESULTS: Baseline HGF levels were correlated positively with body mass index, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin resistance, and inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, and inversely with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P&lt;0.05). Baseline HGF levels were higher among cases than controls (geometric means, 601.8 vs 523.2 pg/mL; P=0.003). Furthermore, the risk of incident ischemic stroke was significantly greater among women in the highest vs lowest quartile of plasma HGF levels (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.12-1.91; P(trend)=0.003) in a conditional logistic regression model that adjusted for body mass index. These results were only slightly attenuated after further adjustment for additional stroke risk factors (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04-1.85; P(trend)=0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating levels of HGF are associated with an increased risk of incident ischemic stroke, independent of obesity and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, among postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years.",M2
20199188,"Heme oxygenase-1 modulates mesangial cell proliferation by p21 Waf1 upregulation.Mesangial cell (MC) proliferation is a hallmark of many progressive renal diseases. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been shown to have an anti-proliferative effect on vascular smooth muscle cells. In the present study, we evaluated the role of HO-1 on MC proliferation and the involved molecular mechanism. Both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) not only enhanced mesangial cell HO-1 expression but also stimulated proliferation of MCs. Interestingly, inhibition of HO-1 induction (by zinc protoporphyrin, ZnP) was associated with an accelerated mitogenic response to EGF and HGF in MCs. Induction of HO-1 was associated with enhanced mesangial cell p21 expression. On the other hand, hemoglobin and ZnP inhibited mesangial cell p21 expression. It appears that the effect of HO-1 on MC growth may be mediated through upregulation of p21 expression.",M2
20197308,"Proinsulin C-peptide antagonizes the profibrotic effects of TGF-beta1 via up-regulation of retinoic acid and <e>HGF</e>-related signaling pathways.Novel signaling roles for C-peptide have recently been discovered with evidence that it can ameliorate complications of type 1 diabetes. Here we sought to identify new pathways regulated by C-peptide of relevance to the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy. Microarray analysis was performed to identify genes regulated by either C-peptide and/or TGF-beta1 in a human proximal tubular cell line, HK-2. Expression of retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II (CRABPII), vimentin, E-cadherin, Snail, and beta-catenin was assessed by immunoblotting. The cellular localization of vimentin and beta-catenin was determined by immunocytochemistry. Changes in cell morphology were assessed by phase contrast microscopy. Gene expression profiling demonstrated differential expression of 953 and 1458 genes after C-peptide exposure for 18 h or 48 h, respectively. From these, members of the antifibrotic retinoic acid (RA)- and HGF-signaling pathways were selected. Immunoblotting demonstrated that C-peptide increased RARbeta, CRABPII, and HGF. We confirmed a role for RA in reversal of TGF-beta1-induced changes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, including expression changes in Snail, E-cadherin, vimetin, and redistribution of beta-catenin. Importantly, these TGF-beta1-induced changes were inhibited by C-peptide. Further, effects of TGF-beta1 on Snail and E-cadherin expression were blocked by HGF, and inhibitory effects of C-peptide were removed by blockade of HGF activity. This study identifies a novel role for HGF as an effector of C-peptide, possibly via an RA-signaling pathway, highlighting C-peptide as a potential therapy for diabetic nephropathy.",M2
20176723,"Novel proapoptotic effect of hepatocyte growth factor: synergy with palmitate to cause pancreatic {beta}-cell apoptosis.Increasing evidence suggests that elevation of plasma fatty acids that often accompanies insulin resistance contributes to beta-cell insufficiency in obesity-related type 2 diabetes. Circulating levels of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) are increased in humans with metabolic syndrome and obesity. HGF is known to protect beta-cells against streptozotocin and during islet engraftment. However, whether HGF is a beta-cell prosurvival factor in situations of excessive lipid supply has not been deciphered. Mice overexpressing HGF in the beta-cell [rat insulin type II promoter (RIP)-HGF transgenic mice] fed with standard chow display improved glucose homeostasis and increased beta-cell mass and proliferation compared with normal littermates. However, after 15 wk of high-fat feeding, glucose homeostasis and beta-cell expansion and proliferation are indistinguishable between normal and transgenic mice. Interestingly, RIP-HGF transgenic mouse beta-cells and normal beta-cells treated with HGF display increased sensitivity to palmitate-mediated apoptosis in vitro. Palmitate completely eliminates Akt and Bad phosphorylation in RIP-HGF transgenic mouse islets. HGF-overexpressing islets also show significantly decreased AMP-activated protein kinase-alpha and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase phosphorylation, diminished fatty acid oxidation, increased serine palmitoyltransferase expression, and enhanced ceramide formation compared with normal islets. Importantly, human islets overexpressing HGF also display increased beta-cell apoptosis in the presence of palmitate. Treatment of both mouse and human islet cells with the de novo ceramide synthesis inhibitors myriocin and fumonisin B1 abrogates beta-cell apoptosis induced by HGF and palmitate. Collectively, these studies indicate that HGF can be detrimental for beta-cell survival in an environment with excessive fatty acid supply.",M2
20172138,"Engraftment is optimal when myoblasts are transplanted early: the role of hepatocyte growth factor.BACKGROUND: In a recent clinical trial, skeletal myoblast (SKMB) transplantation performed late after myocardial infarction (MI) did not improve left ventricular function. We hypothesized that (1) delaying SKMB transplantation until a chronic infarct scar has developed reduces engraftment, and (2) hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), a main regulator of SKMBs, is present in acute but not chronic MI, potentially influencing engraftment. METHODS: Rats underwent coronary artery ligation followed by SKMB transplantation immediately (n = 12) or delayed by 5 weeks (n = 11). The volume of engrafted SKMBs was quantified 6 weeks later. Hepatocyte growth factor was evaluated by computerized analysis of immunohistochemical labeling of rat heart sections 48 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 5 weeks after coronary artery ligation. The impact of HGF on SKMB proliferation and its ability to protect against oxidative stress and hypoxia was evaluated in vitro. RESULTS: Skeletal myoblast transplantation immediately after MI resulted in an engraftment volume of 29.1 +/- 2.9 mm(3). However, delaying SKMB transplantation 5 weeks caused a 95% drop in engraftment (1.4 +/- 0.3 mm(3); p &lt; 0.001). Hepatocyte growth factor labeling in MIs 48 hours after coronary artery ligation was similar to control myocardium (18.0 +/- 2.0 versus 16.8 +/- 1.3 units). However, HGF declined progressively at 1, 2, and 5 weeks after MI (9.1 +/- 1.4, 4.2 +/- 0.4, and 3.1 +/- 0.6 units, respectively; p &lt; 0.05 versus 48 hours). Hepatocyte growth factor caused a dose-dependent increase in SKMB proliferation in vitro and protected against oxidative stress and hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that engraftment of SKMBs is impaired when transplantation is delayed until a chronic infarct has developed. Hepatocyte growth factor in MI declines with time and may enhance engraftment of SKMBs transplanted early after MI. Delivery of exogenous HGF to enhance SKMB engraftment in chronic infarcts warrants further investigation.",M2
20164843,"Plexin B1 suppresses c-Met in melanoma: a role for plexin B1 as a tumor-suppressor protein through regulation of c-Met.Melanoma arises through complex genetic and epigenetic changes, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation, invasion, and metastatic disease. Semaphorins regulate axon guidance through interaction with their receptors, plexins and neuropilins. Plexin B1, the semaphorin 4D receptor, activates oncogenic receptors c-Met and ErbB-2 in several cell types, suggesting it promotes tumor growth through stimulation of these receptors. A study by Argast et al. has shown that plexin B1 is a tumor-suppressor protein for melanoma metastasis in a mouse model. In this report, we show that plexin B1 is lost in metastatic and deeply invasive melanoma in patient samples in vivo. Unexpectedly, introduction of plexin B1 into human melanoma cell lines suppressed, rather than activated, the oncogenic receptor, c-Met, by its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>). Plexin B1 also activated Akt in melanoma. Plexin B1 significantly abrogated cell migration in response to HGF but rendered cells resistant to apoptosis by cisplatin. Plexin B1 is predicted to function as a classic tumor-suppressor protein in melanoma, in part through suppression of c-Met signaling and c-Met-dependent migration. However, because plexin B1 activates Akt, a multifunctional protein involved in tumor progression in several cancers, plexin B1 may function as a tumor promoter in melanomas not driven by c-Met activation.",M2
20160093,"Diacylglycerol kinase alpha mediates <e>HGF</e>-induced Rac activation and membrane ruffling by regulating atypical PKC and RhoGDI.Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) convert diacylglycerol (DAG) into phosphatidic acid (PA), acting as molecular switches between DAG- and PA-mediated signaling. We previously showed that Src-dependent activation and plasma membrane recruitment of DGKalpha are required for growth-factor-induced cell migration and ruffling, through the control of Rac small-GTPase activation and plasma membrane localization. Herein we unveil a signaling pathway through which DGKalpha coordinates the localization of Rac. We show that upon hepatocyte growth-factor stimulation, DGKalpha, by producing PA, provides a key signal to recruit atypical PKCzeta/iota (aPKCzeta/iota) in complex with RhoGDI and Rac at ruffling sites of colony-growing epithelial cells. Then, DGKalpha-dependent activation of aPKCzeta/iota mediates the release of Rac from the inhibitory complex with RhoGDI, allowing its activation and leading to formation of membrane ruffles, which constitute essential requirements for cell migration. These findings highlight DGKalpha as the central element of a lipid signaling pathway linking tyrosine kinase growth-factor receptors to regulation of aPKCs and RhoGDI, and providing a positional signal regulating Rac association to the plasma membrane.",M2
20152807,"Human adipose-derived stem cells enhance the glutamate uptake function of GLT1 in SOD1(G93A)-bearing astrocytes.Impaired glutamate uptake function of astrocytes associated with accumulation of extracellular glutamate is a well-documented feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Enhancing the uptake function of astrocytic glutamate transport 1 (GLT1) may be a potential treatment for this disease. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) are capable of secreting a large number of cytokines which exhibit diverse pharmacological effects. Therefore, we investigate the influence of the soluble factors released by hADSCs on the GLT1 in primary astrocytes cultured from SOD1(G93A) mice, a widely studied mutant human SOD1 transgenic model of ALS. Our data indicate that soluble factors from hADSCs significantly upregulate the expression of GLT1 in SOD1(G93A)-bearing astrocytes, which result in enhanced glutamate uptake function. The upregulation of GLT1 is accompanied by the inhibition of caspase-3 activation in mutant astrocytes. In addition, we find that hADSCs cocultured with SOD1(G93A)-bearing astrocytes produce more VEGF, <e>HGF</e> and IGF-1, which are reported to have neuroprotective effects. Our results suggest that hADSCs may be a potential candidate in cellular therapy for ALS.",M2
20143305,"Therapeutic effect of transplanting beta(2)m(-)/Thy1(+) bone marrow-derived hepatocyte stem cells transduced with lentiviral-mediated <e>HGF</e> gene into CCl(4)-injured rats.BACKGROUND: beta(2)m(-)/Thy1(+) bone marrow-derived hepatocyte stem cells (BDHSCs) isolated from the bone marrow of cholestatic rats by magnetic bead cell sorting consistently express characteristics of both stem and liver cells. These stem cells may be good vehicles for gene transfer. Administration of exogenous hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) may be potentially useful for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Because lentiviral vectors integrate stably into the host-cell genome of nondividing and dividing cells, it may efficiently transfect beta(2)m(-)/Thy1(+) BDHSCs in vitro and secrete high-level HGF consistently. Transplantation of beta(2)m(-)/Thy1(+) BDHSCs transduced with lentiviral vectors containing the HGF gene may reduce liver fibrosis in rats. METHODS: Lentiviral vectors expressing HGF were constructed and used to transduce beta(2)m(-)/Thy1(+) BDHSCs sorted from cholestatic rats in vitro. Transduction efficiency was evaluated and then these cells were transplanted into rats through the portal vein. Liver function as well as histological and immunohistochemical examinations were carried out to assess the therapeutic efficacy on liver fibrosis. RESULTS: We demonstrated that high-level exogenous HGF was detected in supernatants after beta(2)m(-)/Thy1(+) BDHSCs were transfected with lentiviral vectors expressing HGF. Transplantation of transduced beta(2)m(-)/Thy1(+) BDHSCs significantly enhanced liver function and attenuated liver fibrosis in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that transplantation of beta(2)m(-)/Thy1(+) BDHSCs overexpressing the HGF gene may offer a novel approach for promoting liver function and reverse liver fibrosis.",M2
20135719,"Involvement of PI3K and ERK1/2 pathways in hepatocyte growth factor-induced cholangiocarcinoma cell invasion.AIM: To investigate the role of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell invasiveness and the mechanisms underlying such cellular responses. METHODS: Effects of HGF on cell invasion and motility were investigated in two human CCA cell lines, HuCCA-1 and KKU-M213, using Transwell in vitro assay. Levels of proteins of interest and their phosphorylated forms were determined by Western blotting. Localization of E-cadherin was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and visualized under confocal microscope. Activities of matrix degrading enzymes were determined by zymography. RESULTS: Both CCA cell lines expressed higher Met levels than the H69 immortalized cholangiocyte cell line. HGF induced invasion and motility of the cell lines and altered E-cadherin from membrane to cytoplasm localization, but did not affect the levels of secreted matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and urokinase plasminogen activator, key matrix degrading enzymes involved in cell invasion. Concomitantly, HGF stimulated Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation but with slightly different kinetic profiles in the two cell lines. Inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway by the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, markedly suppressed HGF-stimulated invasion of both CCA cell lines, and inhibition of the ERK pathway by U0126 suppressed HGF-induced invasion of the KKU-M213 cell line but had a moderate effect on HuCCA-1 cells. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that HGF promotes CCA cell invasiveness through dys-localization of E-cadherin and induction of cell motility by distinct signaling pathways depending on cell line type.",M2
20129249,"Preexistence and clonal selection of MET amplification in EGFR mutant NSCLC.MET amplification activates ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling in EGFR mutant lung cancers and causes resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors. We demonstrate that MET activation by its ligand, <e>HGF</e>, also induces drug resistance, but through GAB1 signaling. Using high-throughput FISH analyses in both cell lines and in patients with lung cancer, we identify subpopulations of cells with MET amplification prior to drug exposure. Surprisingly, HGF accelerates the development of MET amplification both in vitro and in vivo. EGFR kinase inhibitor resistance, due to either MET amplification or autocrine HGF production, was cured in vivo by combined EGFR and MET inhibition. These findings highlight the potential to prospectively identify treatment naive, patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer who will benefit from initial combination therapy.",M2
20126471,"c-Met overexpression contributes to the acquired apoptotic resistance of nonadherent ovarian cancer cells through a cross talk mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2.Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic cancer mainly because of widespread peritoneal dissemination and malignant ascites. Key to this is the capacity of tumor cells to escape suspension-induced apoptosis (anoikis), which also underlies their resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we used a nonadherent cell culture model to investigate the molecular mechanisms of apoptotic resistance of ovarian cancer cells that may mimic the chemoresistance found in solid tumors. We found that ovarian cancer cells acquired a remarkable resistance to anoikis and apoptosis induced by exposure to clinically relevant doses of two front-line chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel when grown in three-dimensional than monolayer cultures. Inhibition of the hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) receptor c-Met, which is frequently overexpressed in ovarian cancer, by a specific inhibitor or small interfering RNA blocked the acquired anoikis resistance and restored chemosensitivity in three-dimensional not in two-dimensional cultures. These effects were found to be dependent on both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signaling pathways. Inhibitors of PI3K/Akt abrogated ERK1/2 activation and its associated anoikis resistance in response to HGF, suggesting a signaling relay between these two pathways. Furthermore, we identified a central role of Ras as a mechanism of this cross talk. Interestingly, Ras did not lie upstream of PI3K/Akt, whereas PI3K/Akt signaling to ERK1/2 involved Ras. These findings shed new light on the apoptotic resistance mechanism of nonadherent ovarian cancer ascites cells and may have important clinical implications.",M2
20122857,"A comparative study of carotid atherosclerotic plaque microvessel density and angiogenic growth factor expression in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients.OBJECTIVE: A challenge facing clinicians is identifying patients with asymptomatic carotid disease at risk of plaque instability. We hypothesise that locally released angiogenic growth factors contribute to plaque instability. METHODS: Carotid endarterectomy specimens from eight symptomatic and eight asymptomatic patients were interrogated for microvessel density and angiogenic growth factor expression histologically using immunofluorescence, and biochemically using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR). Bio-Plex suspension array was used to assess circulating biomarkers in venous blood from the same patients and six healthy age-matched controls. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence demonstrated significantly greater neovessel density in symptomatic plaques (P=0.010) with elevated expression of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) (P=0.001) and its receptor MET (P=0.011) than in asymptomatic plaques. The q-RT-PCR demonstrated up-regulation of Endoglin (CD105), HGF (P=0.001) and MET (P=0.011) in the plaques of symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients. Bio-Plex suspension array demonstrated elevated HGF (P=0.002) serum levels in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients and healthy controls, and decreased platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (P=0.036) serum levels in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSION: Plaque instability may be mediated by HGF-induced formation of new microvessels, and decreased vessel stability resulting from decreased PDGF. Suspension array technology has the potential to identify circulating biomarkers that correlate with plaque rupture risk.",M2
20122738,"Hepatocyte growth factor and retinal arteriolar diameter in Singapore Chinese.OBJECTIVE: To assess if natural genetic variation in hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) is associated with altered retinal vessel diameter. DESIGN: Two-stage cohort study. PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: Discovery set (set 1, n = 682 children) and confirmatory set (set 2, n = 1293 adults). METHODS: Children in the discovery set were genotyped for a panel of genetic markers within HGF. Markers that were found to be associated significantly with altered retinal vessel diameter then were genotyped in the confirmatory set. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Increased or decreased retinal vessel diameter. RESULTS: In the discovery set (n = 682 Chinese children aged 7 to 12 years), the variant allele of 4 HGF single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) demonstrated association with larger retinal arteriolar diameter. The effect of the variant allele seems to be strongest within a recessive model of inheritance (P(min) = 4.6x10(-3)) for all 4 SNPs. When these 4 SNPs were assessed in a confirmatory study comprising 1293 Chinese adults, successful replication was observed for one of them (HGF +63962; rs5745752); the variant allele was observed to correlate with significantly larger retinal arteriolar diameter, with its effect again strongest within a model of recessive inheritance (P = 0.049). Analyzed as a quantitative trait, recessive carriage at HGF +63962 resulted in on average a 3.5-microm increase in retinal arteriolar diameter among children and a 2.5-microm increase in adults (P = 7.0x10(-3), analysis of variance; P = 3.0x10(-3), Kruskal-Wallis test). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that natural variation within HGF is involved in the control of retinal arteriolar diameter and may be important in the pathogenesis of microvascular disease in individuals of Chinese descent.",M2
20117631,"Facilitated tendon-bone healing by local delivery of recombinant hepatocyte growth factor in rabbits.PURPOSE: This study was performed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) on tendon-bone healing in a rabbit model. METHODS: In adult rabbits the long digital extensor tendon was detached from the lateral femoral condyle, and the free end of the tendon was inserted into a tunnel drilled into the proximal tibial metaphysis. Cancellous bone obtained during drilling of the tibial hole was soaked in saline solution or solution containing 100-microg/mL human recombinant HGF and then transplanted into the bone tunnel. Junctional healing between the tendon and the bone was evaluated by histologic analysis and uniaxial load-to-failure testing at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: In the saline solution-treated control group, Sharpey-like fibers, which connected the tendon graft and the bone tissue, appeared 6 weeks after treatment. At 8 weeks after treatment, maturation of lamellar bone was seen, and at 12 weeks, the adhesion between tendon and bone appeared to be supported by indirect insertion of fibrocartilaginous tissue, wherein the border between the fibrocartilaginous tissue and tendon or bone was significant. In the HGF-treated group, the fibrous tissues were parallel to the load axis, and lamellar bone and Sharpey-like fibers appeared as early as 4 weeks after treatment. At 12 weeks, junctional tissue, characterized by a continuous 4-layer structure of bone, calcified cartilage, fibrocartilage, and tendon, was regenerated by a direct insertion. On biomechanical testing, the HGF-treated group had significantly better biomechanical properties than the control group at 2 and 4 weeks. The histologic improvement caused by HGF treatment was associated with the biomechanical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Local administration of recombinant HGF promotes the adhesive healing process at the tendon-bone junction, both histologically and mechanically, after ligament reconstruction in a rabbit model.

20099972,"The importance of serum levels of selected biological parameters in the diagnosis, staging and prognosis of multiple myeloma.The study aimed at evaluating the relation of 7 parameters associated with the internal biological properties of myeloma cells and the bone marrow microenvironment to multiple myeloma (MM) stages, distinguishing its initial/asymptomatic phase from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and assessing their relation to myeloma prognosis. In the studied group comprising 286 individuals (89 MGUS and 179 MM patients), statistically significant differences (Mann-Whitney test) between MGUS and MM at the time of diagnosis were found in the serum levels of <e>HGF</e> (hepatocyte growth factor), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), ICTP (intercellular - carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen), PINP (procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide), OPG (osteoprotegerin) and syndecan-1/CD138, but not in Fas. Multivariate analysis (logistic regression) revealed an unsatisfactory potential of all the 7 studied indicators to discriminate between MGUS and MM. A deeper analysis showed statistically significant differences between MGUS and the initial/asymptomatic phase of MM (stage 1 according to the International Staging System) only in the cases of syndecan-1 (p=0.001) and Fas (p=0.008). The assessment of initial values of HGF, VEGF, ICTP, PINP, OPG, syndecan-1 and Fas showed a statistically significant relation (log rank test) to the overall survival (OS) in a group of 132 patients treated with conventional chemotherapy only in the cases of syndecan-1 (p=0.0002) and Fas (p=0.018), but in none of the investigated parameters in a group of 74 patients treated with HDT/ASCT (high-dose therapy/autologous stem cell transplantation). The analysis showed that, despite significant differences in serum levels of 6 of the 7 studied parameters found between MGUS and MM, none of the markers may be included in the spectrum of indicators used to distinguish the two conditions. Despite the positive relation, especially of syndecan-1 and, to a lesser extent, of Fas to the OS in patients treated with conventional chemotherapy, these prognostic factors are not applicable to HDT/ASCT.",M2
20092935,"Effect of human seminal fluid on the growth of endometrial cells of women with endometriosis.OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect of human seminal fluid on the growth of endometrial cells derived from women with and without endometriosis. STUDY DESIGN: Seminal plasma (SP) was collected from 18 healthy fertile men. Serum, peritoneal fluid (PF) and tissue specimens of eutopic and ectopic endometrium were collected from 45 women with endometriosis and 20 women without endometriosis during laparoscopic surgery. Prostaglandin (PG) E2, hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), and estradiol (E2) levels in each sample of SP, serum and PF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The growth pattern of cells derived from eutopic and ectopic endometria in response to SP was examined by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. RESULTS: Seminal plasma was able to significantly stimulate the growth of epithelial cells and stromal cells derived from the eutopic and ectopic endometria of women with endometriosis (2-3-fold) when compared with control media. The SP-promoted proliferation of both gland cells and stromal cells derived from eutopic endometria was also remarkably higher in women with endometriosis than that of women without endometriosis. Although levels of PGE2, HGF and E2 in SP were variable when compared with other body fluids, the levels of PGE2 and HGF in SP were significantly higher than those in either peritoneal fluid or serum of women with or without endometriosis. Pretreatment of cells with individual anti-PGE2 antibody, anti-HGF antibody and two selective estrogen receptor modulators, tamoxifen and raloxifene was unable to suppress SP-mediated growth of endometrial cells. However, pretreatment of cells with combined anti-PGE2 antibody plus anti-HGF antibody or combined anti-PGE2 antibody plus anti-HGF antibody plus tamoxifen or raloxifene was able to significantly suppress SP-promoted growth of eutopic and ectopic endometrial cells. CONCLUSION: Human seminal fluid enriched with different macromolecules may promote the growth of endometrial cells derived from women with endometriosis. Our findings may suggest some detrimental effect of unprotected sexual intercourse in women with endometriosis.",M2
20086056,"The angiotensin IV analog Nle-Tyr-Leu-psi-(CH2-NH2)3-4-His-Pro-Phe (norleual) can act as a hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met inhibitor.The angiotensin (Ang) IV analog norleual [Nle-Tyr-Ile-psi-(CH2-NH2)(3-4)-His-Pro-Phe] exhibits structural homology with the hinge (linker) region of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) and is hypothesized to act as a hinge region mimic. Norleual competitively inhibited the binding of HGF to its receptor c-Met in mouse liver membranes, with an IC(50) value of 3 pM. Predictably, norleual was able to inhibit HGF-dependent signaling, proliferation, migration, and invasion in multiple cell types at concentrations in the picomolar range. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that norleual exhibited potent antiangiogenic activity, an attribute that would be predicted for a HGF/c-Met antagonist. Furthermore, norleual suppressed pulmonary colonization by B16-F10 murine melanoma cells, which are characterized by an overactive HGF/c-Met system. Together, these data suggest that AngIV analogs exert at least some of their biological activity through interference with the HGF/c-Met system and may have utility as therapeutic agents in disorders that are dependent on an intact HGF/c-Met system. Finally, the ability of norleual to induce marked biological responses in human embryonic kidney cells, which do not express insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP), coupled with the observed effects of norleual on the HGF/c-Met system, casts doubt on the physiological significance of AngIV-dependent inhibition of IRAP.",M2
20072648,"An orally available small-molecule inhibitor of c-Met, PF-2341066, reduces tumor burden and metastasis in a preclinical model of ovarian cancer metastasis.Deregulated expression of the hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) receptor, c-Met, in cancer contributes to tumor progression and metastasis. The objective of this study was to determine whether blocking c-Met with an orally available c-Met inhibitor, PF-2341066, reduces tumor burden and increases survival in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer metastasis. Treatment of mice injected interperitoneally with SKOV3ip1 cells showed reduced overall tumor burden. Tumor weight and the number of metastases were reduced by 55% (P &lt; .0005) and 62% (P &lt; .0001), respectively. Treatment also increased median survival from 45 to 62 days (P = .0003). In vitro, PF-2341066 reduced HGF-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Met in the tyrosine kinase domain as well as phosphorylation of the downstream signaling effectors, Akt and Erk. It was apparent that inhibition of the pathways was functionally important because HGF-induced branching morphogenesis was also inhibited. In addition, proliferation and adhesion to various extracellular matrices were inhibited by treatment with PF-2341066, and the activity of matrix metalloproteinases was decreased in tumor tissue from treated mice compared with those receiving vehicle. Overall, these data indicate that PF-2341066 effectively reduces tumor burden in an in vivo model of ovarian cancer metastasis and may be a good therapeutic candidate in the treatment of patients with ovarian cancer.",M2

20071014,"Urinary angiostatin levels are elevated in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.OBJECTIVE: The poor prognosis associated with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is due to the lack of overt early symptoms and the absence of reliable diagnostic screening methods. Since many tumors over express angiogenic regulators, the purpose of this study was to determine whether elevated levels of the angiogenic or angiostatic molecules vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), endostatin (ES), and angiostatin (AS) were elevated in plasma and urine from patients with EOC. METHODS: VEGF, HGF, ES and AS were assayed by ELISA in samples from pilot cohort consisting of healthy women (N=48; pre-menopausal N=23, post-menopausal N=25), women with benign gynecological disease (N=54), patients with primary peritoneal cancer (PP) (N=2) and EOC (N=35). Wherever possible, parallel serum samples were measured for CA125 levels by ELISA. RESULTS: AS was the angioregulator that independently discriminated EOC patients from healthy individuals. Levels of urinary AS (uAS) from healthy individuals or women with benign gynecological disease averaged 21.4 ng/mL+/-3.7 and 41.5 ng/mL+/-8.8, respectively. In contrast, uAS averaged 115 ng/mL+/-39.2 and 276 ng/mL+/-45.8 from women with Stage I (N=6) and late stage (N=31) EOC, respectively. Furthermore, uAS was elevated in EOC patients regardless of tumor grade, stage, size, histological subtype, creatinine levels, menopausal status, or patient age, but appeared to complement CA125 measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of AS are elevated in the urine of patients with EOC and may be of diagnostic and/or prognostic clinical importance. Further studies of uAS as a biomarker for EOC alone or in combination with other markers are warranted.",M2
20068147,"Identification of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor, as therapeutic targets in clear cell sarcoma.Clear cell sarcoma (CCS), a childhood tumor of the tendons and aponeuroses, is uniformly fatal once it has metastasized because of its profound therapeutic resistance. CCS is characterized by production of a chimeric transcription factor, EWS-ATF1, which is formed as the result of a disease-specific chromosomal translocation. EWS-ATF1 activates the melanocyte transcription factor MITF, which in turn activates transcription of c-Met, an oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase recently shown to be activated in CCS. Based on this connection, we hypothesized that c-Met inhibition may offer a strategy to treat CCS, as an indirect tactic to defeat a transforming pathway downstream of EWS-ATF1. Here, we show that primary CCS and CCS-derived cell lines express c-Met, which is activated in an autocrine fashion by its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>)/scatter factor in some CCS cell lines. c-Met expression is critical for CCS invasion, chemotaxis, and survival. Blocking c-Met activity with a small-molecule inhibitor (SU11274) or a neutralizing antibody to its ligand HGF (AMG 102) significantly reduced CCS cell growth in culture. Similarly, AMG 102 significantly suppressed in vivo tumor growth in an autocrine xenograft model of CCS. Collectively, these findings suggest the HGF:c-Met signaling axis as a candidate therapeutic target to improve clinical management of CCS.",M2
20068101,"Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AMG 102, a fully human hepatocyte growth factor-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, in a first-in-human study of patients with advanced solid tumors.PURPOSE: The aims were to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose, and antitumor activity of AMG 102, a fully human hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (<e>HGF</e>/SF)-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, in patients with solid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (N = 40) with refractory advanced solid tumors were enrolled into six sequential dose-escalation cohorts (0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg AMG 102 i.v. every 2 weeks) and a dose-expansion cohort (20 mg/kg AMG 102 every 2 weeks). Safety, anti-AMG 102 antibody formation, pharmacokinetics, tumor response, and exploratory biomarkers were assessed. RESULTS: AMG 102 was well tolerated up to the planned maximum dose of 20 mg/kg, and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Treatment-related adverse events were generally mild and included fatigue (13%), constipation (8%), nausea (8%), vomiting (5%), anorexia (5%), myalgia (5%), and hypertension (5%). Two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities: one patient (0.5 mg/kg cohort) experienced grade 3 hypoxia and grade 3 dyspnea and one patient (1 mg/kg cohort) experienced grade 3 upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. No anti-AMG 102 antibodies were detected, and AMG 102 had linear pharmacokinetics within the dose range investigated. Sixteen of 23 (70%) evaluable patients had a best response of stable disease with progression-free survival ranging from 7.9 to 40 weeks. Circulating levels of the biomarker HGF/SF (bound and unbound) increased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas soluble c-Met concentrations were generally similar across doses. CONCLUSIONS: AMG 102 is safe and well tolerated, has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, and will be further investigated as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents.",M2
20066900,"Kiss-1 suppresses MMP-9 expression by activating p38 MAP kinase in human stomach cancer.Kiss-1 has been identified as a putative metastasis suppressor gene in various human malignancies. However, there is little information about its possible role in gastric carcinoma. In this study, we determined whether the Kiss-1 gene negatively regulates MMP-9 expression. cDNA microarray technology was used to identify the genes associated with metastasis by hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) in the gastric cancer cell lines, NUGC-3 and MKN-28. The levels of Kiss-1 RNA and protein were confirmed to be upregulated in HGF-treated gastric cancer cells. HGF induced Kiss-1 and MMP-9 production in a dose-dependent manner. In order to investigate roles of HGF signaling in tumor progression and metastasis, we measured effects of a specific MEK1 inhibitor (PD 098059) and a p38 kinase inhibitor (SB 203580) on HGF-mediated cell proliferation and MMP-9. Pretreatment with PD 098059 reduced MMP-9 and HGF-mediated cell proliferation, but increased Kiss-I expression. In contrast, SB 203580 pretreatment enhanced MMP-9 and cell prolifera-tion, but decreased Kiss-1 expression. Cotreatment of PD098059 and SB203580 increased the p38 phosphorylation stimulated by HGF. These results suggest that the HGF-mediated Kiss-1 overexpression is regulated mainly by the p38 activation and, furthermore, the activation of ERK might affect HGF-mediated Kiss-1 expression indirectly by the regulation of p38 kinase. Consistent with this result, p38 phosphorylation was strongly repressed by the knock-down of Kiss-1. Downregulation of Kiss-1 using Kiss-1 shRNA also increased in vitro cell invasion. In conclusion, Kiss-1 suppresses MMP-9 expression by activating the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway.",M2
20061986,"Correlation of clinicopathological parameters with <e>HGF</e>, c-Met, EGFR, and IGF-1R expression in uveal melanoma.This study evaluated the expression profile of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), c-Met, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and vitreal and serum EGF, HGF, IGF-1 levels in patients with uveal melanoma and assessed their correlation with the clinicopathological parameters. Forty patients with uveal melanoma were included in the study. Clinicopathological parameters were evaluated with hematoxylin-eosin staining. HGF, c-Met, EGFR, and IGF-1R expressions were evaluated immunohistochemically. HGF, EGF, and IGF-1 levels were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in vitreous and serum specimens taken at enucleation and 6 months after the enucleation. HGF, c-Met, IGF-1R, and EGFR expressions were detected in 57.5, 20, 20, and 12.5% of cases, respectively. IGF-1R expression was significantly correlated with the degree of pigmentation, necrosis, and lymphocyte infiltration (P=0.013, 0.04, and 0.017). EGFR expression was significantly correlated with the mitosis rate (P=0.02). Vitreal EGF and serum IGF-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with scleral invasion (15.72+/-29.13, 199.01+/-154.01 pg/ml, respectively) when compared with the patients without invasion (0.56+/-1.05, 33.01+/-36.52 pg/ml) (P=0.03 and 0.015). When the preoperative and postoperative serum growth factor levels were compared, the serum EGF level was found to be lower (125.93+/-62.84, 100.02+/-31.19 pg/ml, P=0.007) and the serum IGF-1 level (165.81+/-153.6, 301.35+/-131.24 pg/ml, P&lt;0.001) was found to be higher in the postoperative 6-month specimens. Uveal melanomas express HGF, c-Met, EGFR, and IGF-1R. Vitreal growth factor levels and expression of EGFR and IGF-1R are correlated with some clinicopathological parameters. IGF-1 and EGF may have a role in the development and progression of uveal melanoma.",M2
20061137,"Recombinant kringle 5 from plasminogen antagonises hepatocyte growth factor-mediated signalling.The blood protein plasminogen is proteolytically cleaved to produce angiostatin and kringle 5 (K5), both of which are known angiogenesis inhibitors. A common structural element between K5, angiostatin and other endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors is the presence of the kringle protein-interacting domain. Another kringle domain-containing protein, hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), promotes angiogenesis by binding to and stimulating the tyrosine kinase receptor Met. HGF binding to Met is dependent on the kringle domains of HGF. Because both K5 and HGF contain kringle motifs and because these proteins have opposite effects on angiogenesis, we hypothesised that K5 can antagonise HGF-mediated signalling in a Met-dependent manner. We determined that K5 binding to H1299 cells is competed by HGF suggesting that these two proteins bind to the same protein. Purified K5 immunoprecipitates with Met and this interaction is abolished by increasing doses of HGF. Using proliferation, phosphorylation of Met and Akt as markers of HGF activity, we determined that K5 inhibits HGF-mediated signalling. Taken together, these data support a model by which K5 binds to Met and functions as a competitive antagonist of HGF signalling and presents a novel mechanism of action of K5.",M2
20059281,"Accelerated adhesion of grafted skin by laser-induced stress wave-based gene transfer of hepatocyte growth factor.Gene therapy using wound healing-associated growth factor gene has received much attention as a new strategy for improving the outcome of tissue transplantation. We delivered plasmid DNA coding for human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) to rat free skin grafts by the use of laser-induced stress waves (LISWs); autografting was performed with the grafts. Systematic analysis was conducted to evaluate the adhesion properties of the grafted tissue; angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and reepithelialization were assessed by immunohistochemistry, and reperfusion was measured by laser Doppler imaging as a function of time after grafting. Both the level of angiogenesis on day 3 after grafting and the increased ratio of blood flow on day 4 to that on day 3 were significantly higher than those in five control groups: grafting with hHGF gene injection alone, grafting with control plasmid vector injection alone, grafting with LISW application alone, grafting with LISW application after control plasmid vector injection, and normal grafting. Reepithelialization was almost completed on day 7 even at the center of the graft with LISW application after hHGF gene injection, while it was not for the grafts of the five control groups. These findings demonstrate the validity of our LISW-based <e>HGF</e> gene transfection to accelerate the adhesion of grafted skins.",M2
20053975,"Aqueous humor levels of hepatocyte growth factor in retinitis pigmentosa.PURPOSE: To determine the level of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) in the aqueous humor of patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). METHODS: This was a prospective, comparative control study. Aqueous humor samples were collected from the eyes of 15 RP patients. The level of HGF was determined with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay kit. The control group was composed of aqueous samples from 15 patients about to undergo cataract surgery with no other ocular or systemic diseases. RESULTS: The concentration of HGF was markedly higher in the aqueous humor of the patients with RP than in that of the control subjects (Mann-Whitney U test, P &lt; 0.001). The level of HGF was 958.75 +/- 271.52 (mean +/- SD) pg/mL in the eyes of the RP patients and 403.52 +/- 116.27 pg/mL in eyes of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of HGF in aqueous humor is higher among patients with RP than in non-RP subjects. This finding provides new evidence that should be taken in account when considering HGF as a neuroprotective treatment for patients with RP.",M2
20050812,"Targeting the angiopoietin (Ang)/Tie-2 pathway in the crosstalk between acute myeloid leukaemia and endothelial cells: studies of Tie-2 blocking antibodies, exogenous Ang-2 and inhibition of constitutive agonistic Ang-1 release.BACKGROUND: The Tie-2 receptor can bind its agonistic ligand Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and the potential antagonist Ang-2. Tie-2 can be expressed both by primary human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells and endothelial cells, and Tie-2-blocking antibodies are now being evaluated in clinical trials for cancer treatment. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of Tie-2-blocking antibodies, exogenous Ang-2 and pharmacological agents on AML cell proliferation and the release of angioregulatory mediators. RESULTS: Tie-2-blocking antibodies had a growth inhibitory effect on human AML cells co-cultured with microvascular endothelial cells, but this inhibition was not observed when leukaemic cells were co-cultured with fibroblasts or osteoblasts. AML cell viability in co-cultures was not altered by anti-Tie-2. Furthermore, anti-Tie-2 decreased hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) levels and increased CXCL8 levels in co-cultures, whereas the levels of endocan (a proteoglycan released by endothelial cells) were not altered. The only significant effects of exogenous Ang-2 were decreased levels of HGF and endocan. Constitutive AML cell release of agonistic Ang-1 was decreased by the proteasomal inhibitor bortezomib and the specific IkappaB-kinase/NFkappaB inhibitor BMS-345541. CONCLUSION: We conclude that various strategies for inhibition of Tie-2-mediated signalling should be considered in AML therapy, possibly in combination with other antiangiogenic strategies.",M2
20040596,"Appl1 is dispensable for mouse development, and loss of Appl1 has growth factor-selective effects on Akt signaling in murine embryonic fibroblasts.The adaptor protein APPL1 (adaptor protein containing pleckstrin homology (PH), phosphotyrosine binding (PTB), and leucine zipper motifs) was first identified as a binding protein of AKT2 by yeast two-hybrid screening. APPL1 was subsequently found to bind to several membrane-bound receptors and was implicated in their signal transduction through AKT and/or MAPK pathways. To determine the unambiguous role of Appl1 in vivo, we generated Appl1 knock-out mice. Here we report that Appl1 knock-out mice are viable and fertile. Appl1-null mice were born at expected Mendelian ratios, without obvious phenotypic abnormalities. Moreover, Akt activity in various fetal tissues was unchanged compared with that observed in wild-type littermates. Studies of isolated Appl1(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed that Akt activation by epidermal growth factor, insulin, or fetal bovine serum was similar to that observed in wild-type MEFs, although Akt activation by <e>HGF</e> was diminished in Appl1(-/-) MEFs. To rule out a possible redundant role played by the related Appl2, we used small interfering RNA to knock down Appl2 expression in Appl1(-/-) MEFs. Unexpectedly, cell survival was unaffected under normal culture conditions, and activation of Akt was unaltered following epidermal growth factor stimulation, although Akt activity did decrease further after HGF stimulation. Furthermore, we found that Appl proteins are required for HGF-induced cell survival and migration via activation of Akt. Our studies suggest that Appl1 is dispensable for development and only participate in Akt signaling under certain conditions.",M2
20021363,"Efficacy of <e>HGF</e> gene transfer for various nervous injuries and disorders.Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was originally identified as a molecule that could stimulate DNA synthesis in rat and human hepatocytes by autophosphorylation of the proto-oncogene c-met, which is a high-affinity receptor for HGF. Although it was at first considered that HGF could exert biological effects only on specific target cells, it has since been demonstrated that HGF mediates inflammatory responses to tissue injury and also regulates cell growth, cell motility, and morphogenesis in a wide variety of cell types, including cells within the nervous system. In the nervous system, HGF plays a role as a potent neurotrophic and angiogenetic factor. This factor promotes both the survival of neurons and the regeneration of injured nerves, and may also function as target-derived axonal chemoattractants, guiding axons to their target. These observations raised hopes that HGF protein might be useful for the clinical treatment of nervous system disorders. However, administration of HGF as a recombinant protein is still beset by a number of problems, such as a short serum half-life and poor access to the central nervous system by the systemic route because of the presence of the blood-brain barrier. These problems can be major obstacles to the clinical use of this factor in a recombinant protein form, and has highlighted the need to develop innovative therapeutic strategies for more efficient delivery into the nervous system. Gene transfer into the nervous system has enormous therapeutic potential for a wide variety of disorders. It appears to have advantages over the administration of single or multiple bolus doses of a recombinant protein because gene transfer can achieve an optimally high, local concentration within the nervous system. In this article, we demonstrate the efficacy of HGF gene transfer and provide an overview of ideal treatment regimes for various nervous injuries and disorders.",M2
20019837,"Co-overexpression of Met and hepatocyte growth factor promotes systemic metastasis in NCI-H460 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells.Complete resection of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is potentially curative, yet approximately 50% of patients are at risk for developing metastatic recurrence. Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) is a receptor tyrosine kinase with demonstrated roles in regulating cellular proliferation, motility, morphogenesis, and apoptosis. Met receptor and its ligand, HGF, are commonly overexpressed in NSCLC, and their overexpression has been associated with poor prognosis, which could potentially involve a paracrine and/or autocrine activation loop. However, there is as yet no direct evidence that HGF-Met signaling directly promotes metastasis in NSCLC cells. Using retroviral transduction, we overexpressed the human c-met and hgf complementary DNA, alone or in combination in the NCI-H460 human large cell carcinoma cell line. The HGF/Met co-overexpressing (H460-HGF/Met) cells demonstrated enhanced tumorigenicity in xenograft SCID mice. When these cells are implanted orthotopically into the lungs of nude rats, only the H460-HGF/Met cells showed higher spontaneous metastases to distant organs including bone, brain, and kidney. These results provide evidence that autocrine overactivation of the Met- HGF loop enhances systemic metastases in NSCLC. Targeted interference of this loop may potentially be an effective adjuvant therapy to improve survival of early-stage NSCLC patients.",M2
20017454,"Increase in the circulating level of hepatocyte growth factor in pancreatic cancer patients.OBJECTIVE: Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) has been reported the cause of many biological events, including cell proliferation, invasiveness, morphogenesis, and angiogenesis. Elevated HGF content in tumor tissue was reported to predict a more aggressive biology in breast and gastric cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty patients with invasive pancreatic cancer investigated. Venous blood samples were collected before the surgery. Sera were obtained by centrifugation and stored at -70 degrees C until assayed. The control group created from healthy individuals. Serum concentrations of soluble HGF were measured by the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. RESULTS: The mean value of serum soluble HGF in patients with invasive pancreatic cancer was 497.2 +/- 53.8 pg/ml and that of control group was 53.6 +/- 7.5 pg/ml and the difference was significant (p &lt; 0.001).

20015528,"Effect of heat-shock protein-90 (HSP90) inhibition on human hepatocytes and on liver regeneration in experimental models.BACKGROUND: Targeting heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has gained great interest for cancer therapy. However, in view of novel multimodality therapy approaches for treating hepatic metastases, concerns have raised regarding the impact of targeted therapies on liver regeneration and repair. In this study, we investigated the impact of HSP90 inhibition on liver regeneration in murine models. METHODS: Effects of HSP90 inhibition on the activation of signaling intermediates, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) were investigated in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) in vitro. Effects of HSP90 inhibition on liver regeneration and repair were determined in a murine hepatectomy model and in a model with acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced liver damage. RESULTS: Inhibition of HSP90 effectively diminished the constitutive phosphorylation of Akt, Erk, and STAT3 in PHHs. Conversely, inhibition of HSP90 significantly increased the expression of both VEGF and HGF mRNA, and induced HSP70 protein in PHH cultures in vitro. In vivo, HSP90 inhibition significantly upregulated constitutive VEGF mRNA and HSP70 in murine livers and did not impair liver re-growth after 70% hepatectomy. Furthermore, BrdUrd-staining and histological quantification of necrotic areas revealed that HSP90 inhibition did not impair liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy, or liver repair that occurs after toxic liver injury with CCl(4). CONCLUSION: Targeting HSP90 does not negatively affect the multifactorial process of liver regeneration and repair in vivo. Hence, the use of inhibitors to HSP90 appears to be a valid option for neoadjuvant therapy of liver metastases when subsequent surgery is intended.",M2
20015241,"Treatment response to bortezomib in multiple myeloma correlates with plasma hepatocyte growth factor concentration and bone marrow thrombospondin concentration.Multiple myeloma (MM) is associated with increased rate of bone marrow angiogenesis. Increased concentration of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) is associated with poor prognosis in patients treated with conventional chemotherapy or thalidomide. We have shown previously that decreased level of thrombospondin, an angiogenesis inhibitor, correlates with poor response to high-dose chemotherapy. The aim of our current study was to evaluate association between therapeutic response to bortezomib and thrombospondin and HGF levels. Peripheral blood plasma concentration of HGF and bone marrow plasma concentration of thrombospondin were measured in patients with MM prior to the initiation of bortezomib therapy. Overall, 58 patients were enrolled, 44/58 (76%) of them with relapsed disease. Treatment outcomes were analyzed for possible associations with pretreatment HGF and thrombospondin levels. Patients who achieved complete response had significantly higher pretreatment HGF levels and lower pretreatment thrombospondin levels than others. More than 70% of patients with low pretreatment HGF and high pretreatment thrombospondin concentrations achieved very good partial response or complete response, in contrast to only 20% of patients with high HGF and low thrombospondin levels. High pretreatment thrombospondin and low pretreatment HGF concentrations are associated with therapeutic response to bortezomib in patients with MM.",M2
20015050,"Pericellular activation of hepatocyte growth factor by the transmembrane serine proteases matriptase and hepsin, but not by the membrane-associated protease uPA.<e>HGF</e> (hepatocyte growth factor) is a pleiotropic cytokine homologous to the serine protease zymogen plasminogen that requires canonical proteolytic cleavage to gain functional activity. The activating proteases are key components of its regulation, but controversy surrounds their identity. Using quantitative analysis we found no evidence for activation by uPA (urokinase plasminogen activator), despite reports that this is a principal activator of pro-HGF. This was unaffected by a wide range of experimental conditions, including the use of various molecular forms of both HGF and uPA, and the presence of uPAR (uPA receptor) or heparin. In contrast the catalytic domains of the TTSPs (type-II transmembrane serine proteases) matriptase and hepsin were highly efficient activators (50% activation at 0.1 and 3.4 nM respectively), at least four orders of magnitude more efficient than uPA. PS-SCL (positional-scanning synthetic combinatorial peptide libraries) were used to identify consensus sequences for the TTSPs, which in the case of hepsin corresponded to the pro-HGF activation sequence, demonstrating a high specificity for this reaction. Both TTSPs were also found to be efficient activators at the cell surface. Activation of pro-HGF by PC3 prostate carcinoma cells was abolished by both protease inhibition and matriptase-targeting siRNA (small interfering RNA), and scattering of MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells in the presence of pro-HGF was abolished by inhibition of matriptase. Hepsin-transfected HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells also activated pro-HGF. These observations demonstrate that, in contrast with the uPA/uPAR system, the TTSPs matriptase and hepsin are direct pericellular activators of pro-HGF, and that together these proteins may form a pathway contributing to their involvement in pathological situations, including cancer.",M2
20015008,"Hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor signalling complex as targets in cancer therapy.Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) and it's receptor, cMET, have become the focus on intense scrutiny since its discovery in the late 1980s [1 2] as regards it role in cancer. HGF is now known to be a potent morphogen that can regulate tissue and organ regeneration and modulate cell morphology, it is a motogen that can stimulate cell motility and migration, and is a mitogen able to regulate cell growth and death and as an angiogenic factor [3]. HGF is can induce both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis [3a; 4]. That HGF and cMET have such a diversity of functions has led to intense interest in the clinical setting due to their potential in their prognostic aspect and therapeutic implications as imaging tools. This issue will focus on recent work that shows strong indications for the value of HGF and cMET in clinical settings.",M2
20015005,"Anti-cancer approach with NK4: Bivalent action and mechanisms.We identified NK4, the N-terminal and four kringle domains of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), as a specific inhibitor of HGF. NK4 binds to the Met/HGF receptor, but does not activate the Met receptor, thereby competitively inhibiting the HGF-Met pathway. Independent of its inhibition of HGF-Met, NK4 acts as an angiogenesis inhibitor. The angioinhibitory action of NK4 is mediated by perlecan, a multidomain proteoglycan involved in vascular basement membrane assembly. The extracellular binding of NK4 to perlecan inhibits cell-associated assembly of fibronectin, and the impaired fibronectin assembly suppresses integrin-dependent angiogenic responses, i.e., endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation. NK4 or an NK4-like fragment is generated by proteases expressed in inflammatory cells, suggesting regulation of physiological or pathological processes by NK4 or NK4-like fragments. In a variety of cancer models, NK4 exhibited anti-cancer effects due to its bifunctional characteristics, including inhibition of invasion and metastasis, inhibition of angiogenesis-dependent tumor growth, and promotion of survival. Several lines of strategies and different molecules that inhibit the HGF-Met pathway have been developed, including small molecular inhibiters of Met tyrosine kinase. The biological action of NK4 as an angiogenesis inhibitor has definite advantages over other molecules. In addition to the well-acknowledged role of HGF-Met in cancer invasion and metastasis, recent studies indicate that activation of the HGF-Met pathway makes tumor-initiating cells invasive and resistant to chemical and radiation therapy. Treatment with NK4 could offer a new therapeutic option for the inhibition of cancer metastasis and growth, and better outcomes for cancer patients.",M2
20015004,"Hepatocyte growth factor activation inhibitors - therapeutic potential in cancer.Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) plays a plethora of roles in the progression of many invasive and metastatic cancers. The interaction between tumour cells and their surrounding stromal environment remains a crucial factor governing tumour invasion and metastasis. HGF is primarily synthesised by stromal fibroblasts as an inactive precursor known as pro-HGF. A number of proteases have demonstrated the ability to convert pro-HGF into the biologically active form of HGF, although the two main factors responsible are HGF activator (HGFA) and matriptase. The HGF activation inhibitors (HAI-1 and HAI-2) are two novel Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors that regulate HGFA and matriptase activity to govern the influence of HGF within the body. Deregulation of HAI expression can lead to shift in the HGF activation/inhibition balance ratio in favour of enhanced HGF production. Therefore, these HGF activation inhibitors may have a direct bearing on cancer invasion and metastasis. This review examines the accumulating evidence on the emerging role and therapeutic potential of HAI-1 and HAI-2 in cancer.",M2
20015003,"Application of biological study for met expression to cancer therapy.Metastasization is an undesirable process in cancer development and may represent the most critical factor in deciding patient prognosis. Organ specificity of the metastasis process suggests the importance of the paracrine factors: one of the most potent paracrine regulators of tumor cell migration is hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (<e>HGF</e>/SF). Because the liver-specific growth factor is HGF, its receptor c-Met expression might play a critical role in metastasization to the liver. Activation of HGF/c-Met signaling has been shown to promote cancer cell invasiveness and trigger metastasis though direct involvement of the angiogenic pathway. Given the importance of aberrant HGF/c-Met signaling, several different therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting the pathway have been developed and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Among these agents, NK4 and AM102 were introduced as HGF inhibitors, and PHA-665752 and Su11274 as c-Met inhibitors and are under study in clinical trials. Further, clinical experience-based study to apply the accumulation of biological knowledge concerning HGF/c-Met to the surgical field is presented.",M2
20013848,"Modulation of vocal fold scar fibroblasts by adipose-derived stem/stromal cells.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To explore whether adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) have therapeutic potential for treating scarred superficial lamina propria through the effects of secreted hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) on scar fibroblasts. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro study using coculture system. METHODS: Scar fibroblasts (SFs) were isolated from ferret vocal folds electrocauterized 2 weeks previously. ASCs were isolated from ferret lipoaspirated subcutaneous abdominal fat. For coculture experiments, the two cell types were combined in Transwell plates for 6 days, followed by 1 or 3 days of monoculture after removing the upper chamber. Assays were then performed on cells and media from the bottom chamber. We measured: 1) the production of hyaluronic acid (HA), collagen and HGF via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, 2) the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), 3) cell proliferation, and 4) apoptosis of SFs (2, 3, and 4 via flow cytometry). Other experiments examined the effects of HGF on SFs and the effects of HGF neutralization in the coculture system. RESULTS: Coculture led to significant decreases in SF collagen production (P &lt; .05), cell proliferation (P &lt; .05), and alpha-SMA expression (P &lt; .05), whereas HA production increased (P &lt; .05). Coculture also increased HGF secretion from ASCs (P &lt; .05). Neutralization of HGF abolished the inhibitory effects of ASCs on SF collagen synthesis (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: ASCs influence SFs to adopt a less fibrotic profile. It appears that HGF is at least one of the soluble factors responsible for this effect. Implanted ASCs could potentially ameliorate vocal fold scar by acting as long-term, intrinsic sources of HGF.",M2
20008840,"Hepatocyte growth factor reduces susceptibility to an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor in EGFR-T790M mutant lung cancer.PURPOSE: The secondary T790M mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the most frequent cause of acquired resistance to the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), gefitinib and erlotinib, in lung cancer. Irreversible EGFR-TKIs are expected to overcome the reversible EGFR-TKI resistance of lung cancer harboring T790M mutation in EGFR. However, it is clear that resistance may also develop to this class of inhibitors. We showed previously that hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) induced gefitinib resistance of lung cancer harboring EGFR-activating mutations. Here, we investigated whether HGF induced resistance to the irreversible EGFR-TKI, CL-387,785, in lung cancer cells (H1975) harboring both L858R activating mutation and T790M secondary mutation in EGFR. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CL-387,785 sensitivity and signal transduction in H1975 cells were examined in the presence or absence of HGF or HGF-producing fibroblasts with or without HGF-MET inhibitors. RESULTS: HGF reduced susceptibility to CL-387,785 in H1975 cells. Western blotting and small interfering RNA analyses indicated that HGF-induced hyposensitivity was mediated by the MET/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway independent of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. Hyposensitivity of H1975 cells to CL-387,785 was also induced by coculture with high-level HGF-producing lung fibroblasts. The hyposensitivity was abrogated by treatment with anti-HGF neutralizing antibody, HGF antagonist NK4, or MET-TKI. CONCLUSIONS: We showed HGF-mediated hyposensitivity as a novel mechanism of resistance to irreversible EGFR-TKIs. It will be clinically valuable to investigate the involvement of HGF-MET-mediated signaling in de novo and acquired resistance to irreversible EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer harboring T790M mutation in EGFR.",M2
20007454,"High concentrations of <e>HGF</e> inhibit skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation in vitro by inducing expression of myostatin: a possible mechanism for reestablishing satellite cell quiescence in vivo.Skeletal muscle regeneration and work-induced hypertrophy rely on molecular events responsible for activation and quiescence of resident myogenic stem cells, satellite cells. Recent studies demonstrated that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) triggers activation and entry into the cell cycle in response to mechanical perturbation, and that subsequent expression of myostatin may signal a return to cell quiescence. However, mechanisms responsible for coordinating expression of myostatin after an appropriate time lag following activation and proliferation are not clear. Here we address the possible role of HGF in quiescence through its concentration-dependent negative-feedback mechanism following satellite cell activation and proliferation. When activated/proliferating satellite cell cultures were treated for 24 h beginning 48-h postplating with 10-500 ng/ml HGF, the percentage of bromodeoxyuridine-incorporating cells decreased down to a baseline level comparable to 24-h control cultures in a HGF dose-dependent manner. The high level HGF treatment did not impair the cell viability and differentiation levels, and cells could be reactivated by lowering HGF concentrations to 2.5 ng/ml, a concentration that has been shown to optimally stimulate activation of satellite cells in culture. Coaddition of antimyostatin neutralizing antibody could prevent deactivation and abolish upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21. Myostatin mRNA expression was upregulated with high concentrations of HGF, as demonstrated by RT-PCR, and enhanced myostatin protein expression and secretion were revealed by Western blots of the cell lysates and conditioned media. These results indicate that HGF could induce satellite cell quiescence by stimulating myostatin expression. The HGF concentration required (over 10-50 ng/ml), however, is much higher than that for activation, which is initiated by rapid release of HGF from its extracellular association. Considering that HGF is produced by satellite cells and spleen and liver cells in response to muscle damage, local concentrations of HGF bathing satellite cells may reach a threshold sufficient to induce myostatin expression. This time lag may delay action of the quiescence signaling program in proliferating satellite cells during initial phases of muscle regeneration followed by induction of quiescence in a subset of cells during later phases.",M2
20005573,"Role of the hepatocyte growth factor gene in refractive error.OBJECTIVE: Refractive errors such as myopia and hypermetropia are among the leading causes of visual impairment worldwide. Several genetic loci have been associated with myopia but none to date have been reported for hypermetropia. We investigated the hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) as a candidate gene influencing these 2 refractive error states. DESIGN: Case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 551 individuals (193 males, 358 females; mean age, 55.41+/-12.65 years) including 117 individuals with high myopia &lt;or= -6.00 diopters (D), 140 individuals with low/moderate myopia (-2.00 to -5.99 D), 148 emmetropic individuals (-0.50 to +0.75 D) and 146 hyperopic individuals (&gt;+2.00 D) were included in the analysis from 3 different Australian population cohorts (The Genes in Myopia Study, the Blue Mountains Eye Study, and the Melbourne Visual impairment project). METHODS: Genotyping of 9 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that encompassed the entire HGF gene and its associated sequences as well as 6 additional SNPs identified through DNA resequencing was undertaken. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genetic association with refraction. RESULTS: After correction for multiple testing, the SNPs rs12536657 (odds ratio [OR], 5.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-26.76) and rs5745718 (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.30-3.85) showed significant association with hypermetropia. Whereas the SNPs rs1743 (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.19-3.43; P = .009), rs4732402 (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.23-3.36; P = 0.005), rs12536657 (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.40-4.05; P = 0.001), rs10272030 (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.31-3.75; P = 0.003), and rs9642131 (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.43-4.14; P = 0.001) showed significant association with low/moderate myopia. CONCLUSIONS: These findings present the HGF gene as the first gene significantly associated with hypermetropia as well as providing evidence of significant association with myopia in a second ethnic population. In addition, it provides insights into the important biological mechanisms that regulate human ocular development (emmetropization), which are currently poorly understood.",M2
20001204,"Hepatocyte growth factor ameliorates progression of interstitial injuries in tubular epithelial cells.OBJECTIVE: Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) and its c-met receptor comprise a signalling system that has been reported to prevent injury in several models of renal disease; however, whether HGF can also retard progression of chronic kidney disease is not known. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of HGF on progression of chronic kidney disease in tubular epithelial cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Studies were performed in human tubular epithelial cells that underwent different glucose concentrations, and then receive HGF or vehicle. The cell apoptosis was tested by DAPI and TUNEL staining. The level of activity of HGF was examined at multiple time-points. The expression of HGF, transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and collagen IV were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: HGF administration was associated with a reduction in TGF-beta(1). The beneficial effects of HGF were associated with reductions in the expression of TGF-beta(1), and in the extent of epithelial cell apoptosis. HGF appeared to induce fibrinolytic pathways by reducing the expression of collagen IV and decreasing levels of PAI-1. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that HGF can retard progression of diabetic nephropathy, primarily by promoting matrix degradation, and that HGF is a potent antifibrogenic factor.",M2
19997800,"Effect of thrombopoietin on platelet counts and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in a rat model.PURPOSE: We investigated the effects of thrombopoietin (TPO) on platelet counts and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats. METHODS: We performed 70% partial hepatectomy on 60 rats given either TPO or a vehicle (controls). The rats were killed 6 h, 24 h, 72 h, or 168 h after the procedure, and we examined the platelet counts, weight of the regenerated liver, hepatocyte proliferation by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling index, and expression of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In the controls, the platelet counts were significantly lower than the basal levels, by about 20%, at 6, 24, and 72 h; then recovered to the basal level at 168 h. Conversely, in the TPO-treated rats, the platelet counts increased significantly by 17%, 35%, and 60%, at 24, 72, and 168 h, respectively. The regenerated liver regained 80% of the pre-hepatectomy weight by 72 h in the controls, whereas reconstitution of the liver was accomplished by 72 h in the TPO-treated rats. Thrombopoietin significantly enhanced the BrdU labeling index of hepatocytes and expression of HGF mRNA 24 h post hepatectomy in TPO-treated rats versus controls. CONCLUSION: Thrombopoietin increased platelet counts; thereby accelerating liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy with enhanced induction of HGF.",M2
19995237,"Regenerative capacity of normal and irradiated liver following partial hepatectomy in rats.PURPOSE: To investigate the regenerative capacity and proliferation related to cell cycle modulators in irradiated livers after partial hepatectomy (PH) in rats. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two experimental groups were given a single dose of either 4-Gy or 8-Gy photon radiation to the whole liver following PH. The control group underwent only PH, without irradiation. The liver specimens were analysed for apoptosis, proliferation and cell cycle related genes between 0.5 and 12 days. RESULTS: Mean change in weight of the remnant liver in the 8-Gy group was significantly lower than in the control and 4-Gy groups. The apex of proliferating cell nuclear antigen labelling and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation index in two irradiated groups were also apparently lower than that in control group. After PH, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta1), and the type II receptor of TGFbeta (TGFbetaR-II), anti-tumour protein 53(p53) and anti-tumour protein21(p21) protein expression in the irradiated livers was higher than in unirradiated ones. Significant apoptosis was noted in 8-Gy group. However, the maximal value of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) mRNA and protein expression in the irradiated group was suppressed and restoration of liver function was delayed. CONCLUSION: Whole liver lower dose irradiation can attenuate regenerative capacity following partial hepatectomy in rats.",M2
19961885,"Combined and sequential delivery of bioactive VEGF165 and <e>HGF</e> from poly(trimethylene carbonate) based photo-cross-linked elastomers.The ability of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) based elastomers to release bioactive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165)) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) separately and in combined and sequential fashions using an osmotic release mechanism was investigated. A TMC-based elastomer was chosen since TMC degrades without producing potentially harmful acidic degradation products, and its mechanical properties can be tailored by copolymerizing with D,L-lactide (DLLA) and epsilon-caprolactone (epsilon-CL) and by controlling the cross-link density. The bioactivities of released VEGF(165) and HGF were assessed using the proliferation of human aortic endothelial (HAEC) and CCL 208 monkey lung epithelial cell lines. VEGF(165) and HGF were lyophilized separately or together with trehalose, rat serum albumin (RSA) and NaCl. No significant elastomer degradation occurred over the initial 8 weeks, during which the bulk of the embedded growth factors were released. The presence of a low concentration of NaCl in the release media did not affect the viability of HAEC and CCL 208 cells. The TMC-based elastomer was able to provide a sustained release of highly bioactive VEGF(165) and HGF for more than 10 days. When released in combination from the same device, VEGF(165) and HGF were released at similar rates. By preparing a dual-layered cylinder, in which VEGF(165) was in the outer layer and HGF in the inner layer, a constant release of VEGF alone was first obtained, followed by overlapping and constant release of the two growth factors after a period of 4days. This study demonstrates the potential of TMC-based elastomers combined with an osmotic mechanism to release acid-sensitive growth factors in bioactive form alone and in combination, in controlled rates and sequences.",M2
19959635,"Effect of mitomycin C on IL-1R expression, IL-1-related hepatocyte growth factor secretion and corneal epithelial cell migration.PURPOSE: To investigate how mitomycin C (MMC) modulates hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) secretions in human corneal fibroblasts and regulates human corneal epithelial (HCE) cell migration. METHODS: Primary human corneal fibroblasts were treated with MMC (0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 mg/mL for 5 minutes) and were cultivated with or without interleukin (IL)-1beta. Transcript and secretion of HGF and KGF were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. The effect of MMC-treated fibroblasts on HCE cell migration was evaluated using a transwell migration assay. The influence of MMC on HGF expression/secretion and HCE cell migration was further confirmed by RNA interference. The number of IL-1 receptors (IL-1R) on the fibroblast surface was analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: MMC alone did not affect endogenous HGF expression, whereas IL-1beta alone significantly upregulated HGF transcripts and secretion. By modifying IL-1R numbers, MMC further upregulated IL-1beta-related HGF expression at a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL but to a lesser extent at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/mL. KGF transcripts and intracellular expression were suppressed by MMC dose dependently in the presence or absence of IL-1beta, whereas KGF secretion was not affected. Conditioned medium from MMC-treated fibroblasts exerted a similar concentration-dependent effect on HCE cell migration, enhancing migration most significantly at 0.05 mg/mL MMC in the presence of IL-1beta. The MMC dose-dependent modulation of HCE cell migration was abolished in HGF-silenced fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: MMC differentially modulated IL-1R expression at various concentrations and regulated HGF and KGF differently. MMC alone did not alter HGF expression. In the presence of IL-1beta, MMC-treated corneal fibroblasts modified HCE cell migration through IL-1beta-induced HGF secretion.",M2
19957370,"Mechanisms for increased expression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) in lactating rats.Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and the bile acid pool size are increased 2 to 3-fold in lactating postpartum rats. We investigated the interaction of nuclear receptors with the Cyp7a1 proximal promoter and the expression of regulatory signaling pathways in postpartum rats at day 10 (PPd10) versus female controls to identify the mechanisms of increased expression of Cyp7a1, which is maximal at 16 hours. Liver X receptor (LXRalpha) and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) recruitment to Cyp7a1 chromatin were increased 1.5- and 2.5-fold, respectively, at 16 hours on PPd10. Expression of nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR), LXRalpha, liver receptor homolog (LRH-1), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), and short heterodimer partner (SHP) messenger RNA (mRNA) and coactivator peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) mRNA was unchanged in PPd10 versus controls at 16 hours, whereas chicken ovalbumin upstream transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) was decreased 40% at 16 hours. Investigation of a repressive signaling pathway, the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in PPd10 versus controls, showed decreased mRNA expression of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>; decreased 60% at 16 hours) and tyrosine kinase receptor c-Met (decreased 44%-50% at 16 hours), but these were not accompanied by decreased expression of phosphorylated c-Jun. Importantly, expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) mRNA in the ileum was decreased 70% in PPd10 versus controls, whereas phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) protein expression in liver was decreased 88% at 16 hours. CONCLUSION: The increased recruitment of LXRalpha, a Cyp7a1 stimulatory pathway, and decreased expression of FGF15 and phosphorylated Erk1/2, a Cyp7a1 repressive pathway, combined to increase Cyp7a1 expression during lactation.",M2
19956874,"Co-elevated expression of hepatocyte growth factor and Interleukin-8 contributes to poor prognosis of patients with primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma.Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) related tumor angiogenesis and prognosis of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has not been identified. The expressions of HGF and IL-8, as well as microvessels density were evaluated in 127 NPC biopsies by immunohistochemical staining. The correlation between these parameters and patient's clinicopathological features was analyzed statistically. In vitro, IL-8 concentration was evaluated in exogenous HGF-treated NPC cell lines by ELISA assay. The presence of EBV was also detected in NPC cells by PCR for Bam HI-W fragment. Both 54.3% (69/127) cases of HGF high-expression in tumor cells and 80.3% (102/127) of HGF high-expression in stromal cells were significantly associated with increased microvessels density, advanced clinical stage, lymph node metastasis and high-expression of IL-8. Angiogenesis exhibited in relation to overall survival of NPC patients (P=0.001), and the patients with HGF and IL-8 dual high-expression tumors had a significantly worse prognosis than those with single protein high-expression and dual low expression tumors (P=0.011 and P=0.026, respectively). Exogenous HGF was observed to promote induction of IL-8 in NPC cells without EBV infection. Co-operating with IL-8, HGF might contribute to a poor prognosis of NPC by inducing angiogenesis through both autocrine and paracrine EBV-independent pathways.",M2
19954474,"Biological effect of anaphylatoxin C5a on the generation of anti-inflammatory substances in leukocyte adsorption.Anaphylatoxins, which are involved in both pro-inflammatory processes and a variety of anti-inflammatory effects, are produced during granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis. We noticed the anti-inflammatory effects of C5a, the strongest anaphylatoxin, in granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of C5a on interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) generation in granulocyte and monocyte adsorption. Peripheral blood containing nafamostat mesilate as an endogenous complement activation inhibitor was divided into four groups: (1) no recombinant C5a added, no contact with cellulose acetate (CA) beads (control group); (2) no C5a added, contact with CA beads; (3) C5a added, no contact with CA beads; and (4) C5a added, contact with CA beads. After incubation, IL-1ra and HGF in plasma were measured. IL-1ra was significantly higher in group 3, in which only C5a was added in the absence of CA beads, compared to groups 2 (P &lt; 0.01) and 4 (P &lt; 0.05). HGF was significantly higher only in group 4, in which C5a was added in the presence of CA beads (P &lt; 0.05), but did not increase in the absence of CA beads. C5a can directly induce IL-1ra generation without the granulocyte and monocyte adsorption stimuli to CA beads, but can synergistically induce HGF generation with the adsorption stimuli, indicating C5a has different effects on IL-1ra and HGF generation.",M2
19951545,"[Effects of insulin on the growth factor secreting function of adipose-derived stem cells]OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of insulin in different concentrations on secretion function of growth factors of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). METHODS: ADSCs were isolated from human abdominal adipose tissue and cultured. The immunophenotype and adipose induced-differentiation were identified, and the third generation cells were collected. The collected cells were assigned to 1 x 10(-8), 1 x 10(-7), 1 x 10(-6) mol/L insulin groups according to the concentration of added insulin. When cells grew into 70% confluence in conventional medium, ADSCs were cultured further in serum-free DMEM containing insulin in different concentrations for 3 days. ADSCs cultured in medium without insulin were used as control group. Secretion amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) of ADSCs were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of the supernatant fluid of ADSCs' nutrient solution on the proliferation and collagen synthesis of the cultured fibroblast were detected by MTT chromatometry and hydroxyproline chromatometry. RESULTS: The secretion amounts of VEGF and HGF of ADSCs in 1 x 10(-8) and 1 x 10(-7) mol/L insulin groups [(471 +/- 41, 762 +/- 66 ng/L), (643 +/- 64, 930 +/- 67 ng/L), respectively] were significantly higher as compared with those in control group (286 +/- 47, 577 +/- 84 ng/L) (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01). No change occurred in the secretion amount of VEGF and HGF of ADSCs in 1 x l0(-6) mol/L insulin group (P &gt; 0.05). The supernatant fluid of ADSCs' nutrient medium of 1 x 10(-8), 1 x 10(-7) mol/L insulin groups showed obvious stimulative effect on the proliferation and collagen synthesis of fibroblasts, and it was most obvious in the 1 x 10(-7) mol/L group (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Insulin in the concentrations of 1 x 10(-8) and 1 x 10(-7) mol/L can notably promote ADSCs' function of secreting VEGF and HGF.",M2
19950811,"Low-dose recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor enhances effect of hepatocyte transplantation in rats treated with retrorsine.BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to regenerate transplanted hepatocytes selectively in a recipient using retrorsine and recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (rhHGF). METHODOLOGY: Nagase analbuminemic rats (NARs) received pretreatment with retrosine and were divided into three experimental groups. Group1: Hepatocyte transplantation (HcTx) + 50 microg/kg/day rhHGF. Group2: HcTx + 250 microg/kg/day rhHGF. Group3: HcTx + normal saline. The serum levels of albumin and the albumin-positive hepatocytes in the liver were investigated. The rat endogenous <e>HGF</e> of the rats given only retrorsine was measured. RESULTS: The serum albumin levels of Group11 were higher than those of Group2, while there was no significant difference between Group2 and GroupS. Histological examination of Group1 and 3 showed the presence of a large number of albumin-positive hepatocytes, which frequently consisted of large clusters and occupied 53.90 +/- 2.31% and 31.25 +/- 5.36% of host liver, respectively. The liver sections of Group2 showed numerous albumin-positive hepatocyte, which were not seen as clusters. The rat endogenous HGF concentration was extremely high. CONCLUSION: Low-dose rhHGF enhances the effect of HcTx under the suppressive state of proliferation of host hepatocytes. Because of the high endogenous HGF, the administration of a high concentration of rhHGF suppressed the regenerative activity of the transplanted hepatocytes.",M2
19944686,"Protection of human corneal epithelial cells from hypoxia-induced disruption of barrier function by hepatocyte growth factor.The barrier function of the corneal epithelium maintains corneal homeostasis and is mediated by tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs). It is also susceptible to disruption by hypoxia. We have now examined the effects of hypoxia on TJs and AJs as well as on barrier function in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. Moreover, we investigated whether such effects of hypoxia might be modulated by hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>). The subcellular distribution of the TJ proteins ZO-1 and occludin, the AJ proteins E-cadherin and beta-catenin, and actin filaments was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The abundance of junctional proteins as well as of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) was determined by immunoblot analysis. Barrier function was evaluated by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Hypoxia-induced both the disappearance of ZO-1 from the borders of neighboring HCE cells as well as the down-regulation of ZO-1 expression without affecting the distribution or abundance of occludin, E-cadherin, or beta-catenin. It also induced the formation of actin stress fibers, the up-regulation of MLCK expression, and a reduction in the TER of HCE cells. All these effects of hypoxia were inhibited by HGF. Neither hypoxia nor HGF exhibited a mitogenic or cytotoxic effect on HCE cells. HGF thus protects HCE cells from hypoxia-induced disruption of barrier function by maintaining the expression and distribution of ZO-1. Inhibition of the effects of hypoxia on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton might also contribute to this protective action of HGF.",M2
19941340,"Expression of the <e>HGF</e> receptor c-met by macrophages in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic cytokine able to evoke a wide array of cellular responses including proliferation, migration, and survival through activation of its receptor c-met. Various types of leukocytes have been described to express c-met suggesting that HGF/c-met signaling may directly influence leukocyte responses in inflammation. We have investigated the HGF/c-met pathway in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a common mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), in which macrophages play a dual role, contributing directly to CNS damage at disease onset but promoting recovery during remission by removing myelin debris. Here we show that during EAE both HGF and c-met are expressed in the CNS and that c-met is activated. We subsequently demonstrate that c-met is primarily expressed in inflammatory lesions by macrophages and a small number of dendritic cells (DCs) and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) but not by microglia or T cells. Complementary in vitro experiments show that only LPS and TNFalpha, but not IL-6, IL-10, or IL-13, are able to induce c-met expression in macrophages. In addition, using TNF signaling deficient macrophages we demonstrate that LPS and TNFalpha induce c-met through distinct pathways. Furthermore, TNFalpha- and LPS-induced c-met is functional because treatment of macrophages with recombinant HGF results in rapid phosphorylation of c-met. Interestingly, HGF/c-met signaling does not modulate cytokine expression, phagocytosis, or antigen presentation but promotes proliferation of activated macrophages. Taken together, our data indicate a pro-inflammatory role for the HGF/c-met pathway in EAE rather than a role in the initiation of repair mechanisms.",M2
19939254,"PHA665752, a small-molecule inhibitor of c-Met, inhibits hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated migration and proliferation of c-Met-positive neuroblastoma cells.BACKGROUND: c-Met is a tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (<e>HGF</e>/SF), and both c-Met and its ligand are expressed in a variety of tissues. C-Met/HGF/SF signaling is essential for normal embryogenesis, organogenesis, and tissue regeneration. Abnormal c-Met/HGF/SF signaling has been demonstrated in different tumors and linked to aggressive and metastatic tumor phenotypes. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated inhibition of c-Met/HGF/SF signaling by the small-molecule inhibitor PHA665752. This study investigated c-Met and HGF expression in two neuroblastoma (NBL) cell lines and tumor tissue from patients with NBL, as well as the effects of PHA665752 on growth and motility of NBL cell lines. The effect of the tumor suppressor protein PTEN on migration and proliferation of tumor cells treated with PHA665752 was also evaluated. METHODS: Expression of c-Met and HGF in NBL cell lines SH-EP and SH-SY5Y and primary tumor tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR. The effect of PHA665752 on c-Met/HGF signaling involved in NBL cell proliferation and migration was evaluated in c-Met-positive cells and c-Met-transfected cells. The transwell chemotaxis assay and the MTT assay were used to measure migration and proliferation/cell-survival of tumor cells, respectively. The PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone was used to assess the effect of PTEN on PHA665752-induced inhibition of NBL cell proliferation/cell-survival and migration RESULTS: High c-Met expression was detected in SH-EP cells and primary tumors from patients with advanced-stage disease. C-Met/HGF signaling induced both migration and proliferation of SH-EP cells. Migration and proliferation/cell-survival were inhibited by PHA665752 in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that induced overexpression of PTEN following treatment with rosiglitazone significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of PHA665752 on NBL-cell migration and proliferation. CONCLUSION: c-Met is highly expressed in most tumors from patients with advanced-stage, metastatic NBL. Furthermore, using the NBL cell line SH-EP as a model, PHA665752 was shown to inhibit cMet/HGF/SF signaling in vitro, suggesting c-Met inhibitors may have efficacy for blocking local progression and/or metastatic spread of c-Met-positive NBL in vivo. These are novel findings for this disease and suggest that further studies of agents targeting the c-Met/HGF axis in NBL are warranted.",M2
19939200,"Hepatocyte growth factor--a new marker for prognosis in acute coronary syndrome.This study was designed to check the properties of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) as a new marker of myocardial necrosis. MATERIALS AND METHOD: In one hundred and four patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), plasma human HGF (hHGF) concentrations were assessed twice, i.e. just after admission to hospital and 24 h afterwards. The primary composite endpoint was assessed at three-month follow-up. RESULTS: The maximal concentration of hHGF (1902 pg/ml) was reached at the time of admission to hospital due to ACS with significant decrease 24 h after the first measurement (705 pg/ml p &lt; 0.0001). hHGF levels in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were higher than in non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and in patients who reached composite primary endpoint (33 patients-4211 pg/ml) vs. event-free 71 patients (1013 pg/ml p &lt; 0.01). The correlation between values of hHGF and N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin I was revealed. CONCLUSION: HGF is a very early, good marker of myocardial necrosis and a sensitive short- and long-term prognostic factor in ACS.",M2
19934371,"Delayed treatment with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 decoys reduces tubulointerstitial fibrosis.We examined the capacity of delayed inhibition of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) to reduce tubulointerstitial fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in mice. Small peptides mimicking parts of urokinase (uPA) and tissular plasminogen activator (tPA) and serving as decoy molecules for PAI-1 were administered daily during the late stages (3 to 8 days) of UUO. Treatment with PAI-1 decoys reduced interstitial deposition of fibronectin, collagen III and collagen IV without changes in macrophage and myofibroblast infiltration. Interestingly, while PAI-1 activity was reduced and the combined uPA and tPA activity was increased, the antifibrotic effect was obtained without modification of plasmin activity but with increased of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) expression. We show for the first time that treatment with small PAI-1 decoy peptides reduces established tubulointerstitial fibrosis. This protective effect probably resulted from increased degradation of the extracellular matrix by an HGF dependent mechanism.",M2
19931736,"Effects of adenovirus-mediated delivery of the human hepatocyte growth factor gene in experimental radiation-induced heart disease.PURPOSE: Irradiation to the heart may lead to late cardiovascular complications. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether adenovirus-mediated delivery of the human hepatocyte growth factor gene could reduce post-irradiation damage of the rat heart and improve heart function. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty rats received single-dose irradiation of 20 Gy gamma ray locally to the heart and were randomized into two groups. Two weeks after irradiation, these two groups of rats received Ad-<e>HGF</e> or mock adenovirus vector intramyocardial injection, respectively. Another 10 rats served as sham-irradiated controls. At post-irradiation Day 120, myocardial perfusion was tested by myocardial contrast echocardiography with contrast agent injected intravenously. At post-irradiation Day 180, cardiac function was assessed using the Langendorff technique with an isolated working heart model, after which heart samples were collected for histological evaluation. RESULTS: Myocardial blood flow was significantly improved in HGF-treated animals as measured by myocardial contrast echocardiography at post-irradiation Day 120 . At post-irradiation Day 180, cardiac function was significantly improved in the HGF group compared with mock vector group, as measured by left ventricular peak systolic pressure (58.80 +/- 9.01 vs. 41.94 +/- 6.65 mm Hg, p &lt; 0.05), the maximum dP/dt (5634 +/- 1303 vs. 1667 +/- 304 mm Hg/s, p &lt; 0.01), and the minimum dP/dt (3477 +/- 1084 vs. 1566 +/- 499 mm Hg/s, p &lt; 0.05). Picrosirius red staining analysis also revealed a significant reduction of fibrosis in the HGF group. CONCLUSION: Based on the study findings, hepatocyte growth factor gene transfer can attenuate radiation-induced cardiac injury and can preserve cardiac function.",M2
19929458,"Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in vitro: evaluation of an optimal expansion medium preserving stemness.BACKGROUND AIMS: The potential of cultured adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) in regenerative medicine and new cell therapeutic concepts has been shown recently by many investigations. However, while the method of isolation of ASC from liposuction aspirates depending on plastic adhesion is well established, a standard expansion medium optimally maintaining the undifferentiated state has not been described. METHODS: We cultured ASC in five commonly used culture media (two laboratory-made media and three commercially available media) and compared them with a standard medium. We analyzed the effects on cell morphology, proliferation, hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) expression, stem cell marker profile and differentiation potential. Proliferation was measured with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and a fluorescent assay. Release of HGF was assessed by an immunoassay. Expression of characteristic stem cell-related transcription factors and markers was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (Nanog, Sox-2, Rex-1, nestin and Oct-4) and flow cytometry (CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105 and CD166), and differentiation was shown by adipogenic medium. RESULTS: The morphology and expansion of ASC were significantly affected by the media used, whereas none of the media influenced the ASC potential to differentiate into adipocytes. Furthermore, two of the media induced an increase in expression of transcription factors, an increased secretion of HGF and a decrease in CD105 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Culture of ASC in one of these two media before using the cells in cell therapeutic approaches may have a benefit on their regenerative potential.",M2
19927628,"[Autologous mesenchymal stem cell implantation promotes myocardial expressions of growth factors and improves cardiac function in failing rat hearts]OBJECTIVE: To explore the underlying mechanism of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transfer induced cardiac function improvement in failing hearts. METHODS: Congestive heart failure (CHF) was induced in rats by cauterization of the heart wall. MSCs were cultured from autologous bone marrow and injected into the border zone and the remote myocardium 5 days after cauterization. RESULTS: Ten weeks later, cardiomyocyte nucleus mitotic index, capillary density and expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were significantly increased in the border zone and significantly reduced in the remote myocardium in CHF rats (all P&lt;0.05 vs. sham). Besides cardiac function improvement and left ventricular remodeling attenuation evidenced by hemodynamic and echocardiographic examinations, expressions of IGF-1, HGF and VEGF in the remote myocardium and in the border zone were also significantly upregulated (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01 vs. CHF), and cardiomyocyte nucleus mitotic index as well as capillary density were significantly increased in CHF rats with MSCs (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01 vs. CHF). Moreover, collagen area was significantly reduced and myocardial area was significantly increased in the border zone in these rats too. CONCLUSION: Autologous MSC implantation upregulated expressions of growth factors enhanced cardioangiogenesis which might be the underlying mechanisms for improved cardiac function and attenuated left ventricular remodeling induced by MSCs transplantation in failing rat myocardium.",M2
19925286,"Hepatocyte growth factor/activin A/follistatin system activation during hemodialysis with different low molecular weight heparins.Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), activin A (Act A), and follistatin (FS) compose an organotrophic system; interestingly it is modified by heparin. To understand if LMWHs (considered distinct drugs) have different clinical profiles regarding the above growth factors, we studied the effects of enoxaparin, nadroparin, and dalteparin on their plasma levels. Seventeen chronic HD patients completed this prospective, crossover trial. They were randomized into six groups: each patient was administered enoxaparin (effective dose of 0.75 mg/kg), nadroparin (70.4 IU/kg) and dalteparin (78.6 IU/kg) in three time periods of two months each. At the end of this period, the cytokine's plasma levels were measured by immunoassays at the start and at 10 min and 180 min of the HD procedure. At 10 min, we observed a striking increase in plasma HGF (32-fold), Act A (4-fold), and FS (53%), all p = 0.0003. The levels of HGF and Act A remained markedly elevated after 180 min (by 295% and 87%, respectively; both p &lt; 0.002), while those of FS returned to baseline. There were no differences in cytokine profile comparing both their peak concentrations and the areas under the curve. Enoxaparin, dalteparin, and nadroparin are seemingly not different considering the release of HGF/Act A/FS during HD procedures; this may reflect their similar profile in other aspects. Moreover, the concentrations of HGF/Act A/FS are close to therapeutic ones, which may partly explain the mechanisms underlying some of the emerging extra-anticoagulant effects of LMWHs.",M2
19921488,"Tissue factor mediates the <e>HGF</e>/Met-induced anti-apoptotic pathway in DAOY medulloblastoma cells.The classical treatment scheme for medulloblastoma (MB) is based on a tri-therapy approach consisting of surgical tumor resection, craniospinal axis radiation and chemotherapy. With current treatments relying mainly on non-specific cytotoxic therapy, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance to these treatments is important in order to improve their effectiveness. In this study, we report that stimulation of DAOY with HGF resulted in the protection of these cells against etoposide-induced apoptosis, this anti-apoptotic effect being correlated with an increase in the expression of tissue factor (TF), the initiator of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. HGF-mediated protection from apoptosis was abolished by a c-Met inhibitor as well as by siRNA-mediated reduction of TF levels, implying a central role of Met-dependent induction of TF expression in this process. Accordingly, stimulation of DAOY with FVIIa, the physiological ligand of TF, also resulted in a significant protection from etoposide-mediated cytotoxicity. Overall, our results suggest the participation of the haemostatic system to drug resistance in MB and may thus provide novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these tumors.",M2
19920187,"Fibroblast hepatocyte growth factor promotes invasion of human mammary ductal carcinoma in situ.Stromal-derived hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) acting through its specific proto-oncogene receptor c-Met has been suggested to play a paracrine role in the regulation of tumor cell migration and invasion. The transition from preinvasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive breast carcinoma is marked by infiltration of stromal fibroblasts and the loss of basement membrane. We hypothesized that HGF produced by the infiltrating fibroblasts may alter proteolytic pathways in DCIS cells, and, to study this hypothesis, established three-dimensional reconstituted basement membrane overlay cocultures with two human DCIS cell lines, MCF10.DCIS and SUM102. Both cell lines formed large dysplastic structures in three-dimensional cultures that resembled DCIS in vivo and occasionally developed invasive outgrowths. In coculture with HGF-secreting mammary fibroblasts, the percentage of DCIS structures with invasive outgrowths was increased. Activation of c-Met with conditioned medium from HGF-secreting fibroblasts or with recombinant HGF increased the percentage of DCIS structures with invasive outgrowths, their degradation of collagen IV, and their secretion of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor. In agreement with the in vitro findings, coinjection with HGF-secreting fibroblasts increased invasiveness of MCF10.DCIS xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Our study shows that paracrine HGF/c-Met signaling between fibroblasts and preinvasive DCIS cells enhances the transition to invasive carcinomas and suggests that three-dimensional cocultures are appropriate models for testing therapeutics that target tumor microenvironment-enhanced invasiveness.",M2
19920075,"The growth-promoting effect of KGF on limbal epithelial cells is mediated by upregulation of DeltaNp63alpha through the p38 pathway.Corneal epithelial stem cells are thought to reside in the limbus, the transition zoon between cornea and conjunctiva. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) are two paracrine factors that regulate the proliferation, migration and differentiation of the limbal epithelial cells; however, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In an ex vivo limbal explant culture, we found that KGF is a more potent growth stimulator for the epithelial outgrowth than HGF. Immunofluorescence studies of the epithelial outgrowth from cells treated with HGF or KGF showed similar expression patterns of keratin-3 and keratin-14. Interestingly, p63 was highly expressed in KGF-treated limbal epithelial sheets but not in those treated with HGF. Kinase inhibitor studies showed that induction of DeltaNp63alpha expression by KGF is mediated via the p38 pathway. The effect of KGF on limbal epithelial outgrowth was significantly reduced when endogenous DeltaNp63alpha was suppressed, suggesting that KGF-induced limbal epithelial outgrowth is dependent on the expression of DeltaNp63alpha. Our findings strongly suggest that limbal keratocytes regulate limbal epithelial cell growth and differentiation through a KGF paracrine loop, with DeltaNp63alpha expression as one of the downstream targets.",M2
19913294,"The effect of timing in the administration of hepatocyte growth factor to modulate BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation.Development of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling modulators may provide useful therapeutic options for the treatment of large bony defects in clinical settings. Controversy remains over whether hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) is a positive or negative modulator of BMP-induced osteogenesis. This study analyzed osteogenic properties of HGF, particularly during BMP-2-induced bone formation. Using a mouse model of ectopic bone formation, HGF-impregnated gelatin sponges displayed significantly reduced bone formation induced by BMP-2, both radiologically and histologically. Abrogation of endogenous HGF production by knockdown of HGF mRNA resulted in upregulation of BMP-2-induced ALP activity for C2C12 myoblasts in vitro. In contrast, addition of exogenous HGF inhibited BMP-2-induced ALP activity and osteocalcin production by mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) through HGF-c-Met interactions. Inhibition of ALP activity by HGF was rescued by U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, indicating that HGF suppresses the BMP-2-Smad axis via activation of ERK1/2. Importantly, treatment with HGF prior to administration of BMP-2 induced cellular proliferation of MEFs and did not influence subsequent osteoblast differentiation induced by BMP-2. The effects of HGF may differ according to the differentiation stage of mesenchymal stem cells, which would explain the inconsistencies seen in osteogenic properties of HGF in previous reports. The timing of HGF treatment is critical and should be carefully determined for successful induction of bone formation by BMPs.",M2
19910109,"Repeated hepatocyte growth factor neutralizing antibody treatment leads to <e>HGF</e>/SF unresponsiveness in human glioblastoma multiforme cells.The purpose of this work is to seek putative markers for multi-targeted therapeutic treatment of human glioblastoma. We previously developed an anti-HGF neutralizing antibody cocktail Amix that inhibits human glioblastoma growth in mouse xenograft models. When these treated tumors were re-injected into nude mice and treatment with the neutralizing antibody cocktail plus heparin was repeated, the growth of the twice-treated tumors became HGF-independent, suggesting a possible switch in dominant signaling pathways. Microarray of the tumor cells revealed a number of genes elevated in the twice-treated tumor cells relative to untreated control tumors, including BAI1, CASP8, IL8, IGF1, TGFB1 and TNF. Our analyses provide a series of putative markers for additional evaluation in treating glioblastoma. Multi-targeted therapeutic approach might be a better solution for treating this disease.",M2

19888551,"Hepatocyte growth factor-mediated attraction of mesenchymal stem cells for apoptotic neuronal and cardiomyocytic cells.Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) home to injured tissues and have regenerative capacity. In this study, we have investigated in vitro the influence of apoptotic and necrotic cell death, thus distinct types of tissue damage, on MSC migration. Concordant with an increased overall motility, MSC migrated towards apoptotic, but not vital or necrotic neuronal and cardiac cells. Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) was expressed by the apoptotic cells only. MSC, in contrast, revealed expression of the HGF-receptor, c-Met. Blocking HGF bioactivity resulted in significant reduction of MSC migration. Moreover, recombinant HGF attracted MSC in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, apoptosis initiates chemoattraction of MSC via the HGF/c-Met axis, thereby linking tissue damage to the recruitment of cells with regenerative potential.",M2
19880243,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer.Ovarian cancer is a highly metastatic disease and the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy. Hence, and understanding of the molecular changes associated with ovarian cancer metastasis could lead to the identification of targets for novel therapeutic interventions. The conversion of an epithelial cell to a mesenchymal cell plays a key role both in the embryonic development and cancer invasion and metastasis. Cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) lose their epithelial morphology, reorganize their cytoskeleton and acquire a motile phenotype through the up- and down-regulation of several molecules including tight and adherent junctions proteins and mesenchymal markers. EMT is believed to be governed by signals from the neoplastic microenvironment including a variety of cytokines and growth factors. In ovarian cancer EMT is induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) and endothelin-1 (ET-1). Alterations in these cellular pathways candidate them as useful target for ovarian cancer treatment.",M2
19877197,"Chronic vocal fold scar restoration with hepatocyte growth factor hydrogel.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Therapeutic challenges exist in the management of vocal fold scarring. We have previously demonstrated the therapeutic potential of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) in the management of acute phase vocal fold scarring using a novel hydrogel-based HGF drug delivery system (DDS). However, the effect of HGF on matured vocal fold scarring remains unclear. The current study aims to investigate the effect of HGF-DDS on chronic vocal fold scarring using a canine model. STUDY DESIGN: Animal model. METHODS: Vocal folds from eight beagles were unilaterally scarred by stripping the entire layer of the lamina propria; contralateral vocal folds were kept intact as normal controls. Six months after the procedures, hydrogels (0.5 mL) containing 1 microg of HGF were injected into the scarred vocal folds of four dogs (HGF-treated group). Hydrogels containing saline solution were injected into the other four dogs (sham group). Histological and vibratory examinations on excised larynges were completed for each group 9 months after the initial surgery. RESULTS: Experiments conducted on excised larynges demonstrated significantly better vibrations in the HGF-treated group in terms of mucosal wave amplitude. Although phonation threshold pressure was significantly lower in the HGF-treated group compared with the sham group, no significant differences were observed in the normalized glottal gap between HGF-treated and sham groups. Histological examinations of the HGF-treated vocal folds showed reduced collagen deposition and less tissue contraction with favorable restoration of hyaluronic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that administration of HGF may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic vocal fold scarring.",M2
19858036,"Hepatocyte growth factor suppresses transforming growth factor-beta-1 and type III collagen in human primary renal fibroblasts.Tubulointerstitial changes in the diabetic kidney correlate closely with renal fibrosis, and transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-beta1) is thought to play a key role in this process. In contrast, hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) has shown therapeutic effects on injured renal tubules in animal models. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the preventive effects of HGF may result from interventions in TGF-beta1-mediated signaling and collagen III secretion. We examined the expression of HGF/HGF receptor (c-Met) and TGF-beta1 in renal fibroblasts at multiple time points. The effects of recombinant human HGF on TGF-beta1 expression were studied by RT-PCR and Western blotting, and the levels of collagen III were measured by ELISA. In the high-glucose condition, the expression of HGF and c-Met in renal fibroblasts was detected as early as 6 hours following cell culture while the level of TGF-beta1 peaked at 96 hours. The addition of recombinant human HGF to the culture media dose-dependently inhibited TGF-beta1 mRNA expression and reduced collagen III secretion by 34%. These results indicate that, during hyperglycemia, HGF inhibits TGF-beta1 signaling and type III collagen activation in interstitial fibroblasts. Furthermore, we should recognize that changes in the balance between HGF and TGF-beta1 might be decisive in the pathogenesis of chronic renal fibrosis. Therefore, administration of HGF to restore this balance may offer a novel therapeutic intervention in managing renal fibrogenesis in diabetic nephropathy.",M2

METHODS: Forty Wistar rats were divided into five groups after the models of liver fibrosis were prepared: (1) HGF, ultrasound, and microbubbles (HGF+US/MB); (2) HGF and ultrasound (HGF+US); (3) HGF and microbubbles (HGF+MB); (4) HGF (HGF); and (5) model alone (MA). All rats were killed after being transfected for 14 days. Recovery of the liver was detect by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and pathological methods. Collagen I expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. Hepatocyte growth factor expression in the liver was detect by western blotting. RESULTS: The results of DWI and pathological examination showed the recovery of liver in HGF+US/MB group were better than those of other groups. In HGF+US/MB group, collagen I expression was less, and HGF protein was the highest among all the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction could deliver HGF into the fibrotic liver and produce an antifibrosis effect, which could provide a novel strategy for gene therapy of liver fibrosis.",M2
19856144,"Hepatocyte growth factor in cerebrospinal fluid is associated with mortality and recurrence of glioblastoma, and could be of prognostic value.Malignant gliomas--glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma--are among the most fatal forms of cancer in humans. It has been suggested that hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) is a reliable predictor of glioma malignancy; amounts of HGF are directly related to cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, low apoptotic rate, and poor prognosis (WHO III and IV). We measured the HGF content of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with malignant glioma glioblastoma multiforme (WHO IV; n = 14), anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO III; n = 4), and meningioma (WHO I; n = 9), and from control subjects (n = 25), and found a high concentration of HGF in patients with malignant glioma. However, CSF concentrations from glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma patients were not statistically significantly different (893 +/- 157 vs. 728 +/- 61, respectively; P &gt; 0.01). A negative correlation between HGF and survival was found at five years of follow-up (R = -0.922, R (2) = 0.850, P &lt; 0.001). Also, the HGF concentration in CSF was a reliable means of explaining the highly variable survival of patients with malignant glioma. CSF concentrations of HGF higher than 500 pg/ml were associated with increased mortality whereas values higher than 850 pg/ml were associated with a brief tumor-free period after surgery (9 +/- 0.6 vs. 6 +/- 0.6 months, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Our findings support the idea that measurement of HGF in CSF could be a useful tool for monitoring the biological activity of malignant glioma. The findings will ultimately need to be confirmed in a much larger study.",M2
19853659,"Matriptase/epithin participates in mammary epithelial cell growth and morphogenesis through <e>HGF</e> activation.The epithelial-derived, type II transmembrane serine protease matriptase, the mouse homologue of which is epithin, has been shown to be involved in epidermal differentiation, hair formation, and thymus function. We show in this study that epithin/matriptase (Epi/MTP) plays a significant role in mammary epithelial cell growth and morphogenesis. Epi/MTP is expressed at low level in the mouse mammary epithelium of young animals and it accumulates at the terminal end-bud of the growing ducts. The level of Epi/MTP is elevated in the mammary glands at stages when epithelial proliferation and modeling occur. It is primarily present in the luminal epithelial cells of mouse mammary ducts and lobules. Using an ex vivo three-dimensional culture system for mammary epithelial functional assays, we show that mammary epithelial growth and morphogenesis in the presence of the latent form hepatocyte growth factor (pro-HGF) are blocked either by an inhibitor of the Epi/MTP protease activity or by siRNA knockdown of the Epi/MTP expression. These studies demonstrate that Epi/MTP participates in mammary epithelial growth and modeling through activation of pro-HGF. Our findings reveal an important pathway in normal mammary epithelial morphogenesis which may participate in breast cancer progression.",M2

Hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>) and its tyrosine kinase receptor, MET, are expressed and temporally regulated during mammary development and differentiation. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands have also been implicated in mammary gland growth and morphogenesis. Since both cytokines seem to exert a morphogenic program in this tissue, we have investigated the possible concerted action of EGF and HGF on the HC11 cell line, a widely used model of nontumorigenic mammary cells. Western blot analysis indicated that HC11 expressed MET and EGFR, and showed ERK1/2 and AKT activation following HGF or EGF treatment. Analysis by real-time PCR and western blot showed that after an EGF but not HGF or insulin-like growth factor-I treatment, HC11 mammary cells exhibited an increase in MET expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, which was dependent on the AKT pathway. Simultaneous treatment with HGF and EGF increased proliferation, scatter, and invasion as assessed by cell count, cell cycle, scatter, and transwell assays. AKT inhibition did not influence the cooperation on proliferation or invasion after HGF+EGF treatment, while ERK1/2 inhibition abolished MET/EGFR cooperation on proliferation. HGF+EGF treatment increased the duration of ERK1/2 and AKT activation compared to HGF or EGF alone. All these data indicate that a crosstalk between the EGF and HGF pathways in mammary epithelial cells may modulate the development of the mammary gland.",M2
19846936,"Glutathione modulation reverses the growth-promoting effect of growth factors, improving the 5-fluorouracil antitumour response in WiDr colon cancer cells.BACKGROUND: A common cause of treatment failure in colorectal cancer is chemoresistance, which may be related to the redox state of cancer cells and the tumour microenvironment, where growth factors (GFs) play an important role. Glutathione (GSH), a key regulator of the redox balance, is involved in GF signalling systems and may also protect against drug-induced cellular injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of GSH modulation on 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) activity on the WiDr colon cancer cell line was studied. Cell proliferation and GSH content were assessed. Cells were exposed to the GSH modulators, L-buthionine-SR-sulfoximine (BSO) or L 2 oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTZ), before treatment with 5-FU in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or epidermal growth factor (EGF). RESULTS: Exposure to GFs significantly increased GSH levels and induced a pro-tumour effect. During the first 48 h of incubation, VEGF and EGF induced a near 30% reduction in 5-FU antitumour activity, while exposure to HGF abrogated the drug-induced growth inhibition. Treatment with OTZ and BSO abrogated the growth-promoting effects of GFs. Moreover, the addition of either of the GSH modulators to 5-FU produced an increase of nearly 40% in the 5-FU activity in the case of HGF or VEGF, and a 25% increase in the case of EGF. CONCLUSION: GSH manipulation could yield a therapeutic gain for chemotherapy with 5-FU in the presence of GFs.",M2
19846215,"An artificial extracellular matrix created by hepatocyte growth factor fused to IgG-Fc.The design of artificial extracellular matrices (ECM) has attracted much attention in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine as well as in molecular biology research. A recombinant hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>), fused to an immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc region (abbreviated as AeHGF-Fc) was constructed and confirmed by Western blot assay. Almost similar amounts of HepG2 cells adhered to AeHGF-Fc-coated surface compared to collagen-coated one with large morphological changes. Immobilized AeHGF-Fc continuously activated Akt in HepG2 cells whereas Akt activation induced by soluble HGF rapidly decreased with time, indicating that immobilized AeHGF-Fc follows different signal transduction pathways compared to soluble HGF.",M2
19843665,"Crosstalk to stromal fibroblasts induces resistance of lung cancer to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.PURPOSE: Lung cancers with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations show good clinical response to gefitinib and erlotinib, selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) to EGFR, but these tumors invariably develop drug resistance. Host stromal cells have been found to have a considerable effect on the behavior of cancer cells. Little is known, however, about the role of host cells on the sensitivity of cancer cells to receptor TKIs. We have therefore assessed the effect of crosstalk between stromal cells and lung cancer cells harboring EGFR mutations on susceptibility to EGFR-TKIs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the gefitinib sensitivity of lung cancer cells with EGFR-activating mutations, PC-9 and HCC827, when cocultured with fibroblasts and coinjected into severe combined immunodeficient mice. We also examined the effect of lung cancer cells to fibroblast recruitment. RESULTS: Both human fibroblast cell lines and primary cultured fibroblasts produced various levels of hepatocyte growth factor (<e>HGF</e>). Lung cancer cells markedly recruited fibroblasts. The lung cancer cells became resistant to EGFR-TKIs when cocultured in vitro with HGF-producing fibroblasts and coinjected into severe combined immunodeficient mice. Importantly, combined use of gefitinib plus anti-HGF antibody or the HGF antagonist, NK4, successfully overcame the fibroblast-induced EGFR-TKI resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Colocalization of fibroblasts and HGF was detected in both xenograft tumors in mouse model and lung cancer patient specimens. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that crosstalk to stromal fibroblasts plays a critical role in lung cancer resistance to EGFR-TKIs and may be an ideal therapeutic target in lung cancer with EGFR-activating mutations.",M2
