19904826,"Influence of pH on transungual passive and iontophoretic transport.The present study investigated the effects of pH on nail permeability and the transport of <e>ions</e> such as sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) ions endogenous to nail and hydronium and hydroxide ions present at low and high pH, which might compete with drug transport across hydrated nail plate during iontophoresis. Nail hydration and passive transport of water across the nail at pH 1-13 were assessed. Subsequently, passive and iontophoretic transport experiments were conducted using (22)Na and (36)Cl ions under various pH conditions. Nail hydration was independent of pH under moderate pH conditions and increased significantly under extreme pH conditions (pH &gt;11). Likewise, nail permeability for water was pH independent at pH 1-10 and an order of magnitude higher at pH 13. The results of passive and iontophoretic transport of Na and Cl ions are consistent with the permselective property of nail. Interestingly, extremely acidic conditions (e.g., pH 1) altered nail permselectivity with the effect lasting several days at the higher pH conditions. Hydronium and hydroxide ion competition in iontophoretic transport was generally negligible at pH 3-11 was significant at the extreme pH conditions studied.",M1
19759293,"Selective expression of ligand-gated <e>ion</e> channels in L5 pyramidal cell axons.NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent strengthening of neurotransmitter release has been widely observed, including in layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cells of the visual cortex, and is attributed to the axonal expression of NMDARs. However, we failed to detect NMDAR-mediated depolarizations or Ca(2+) entry in L5 pyramidal cell axons when focally stimulated with NMDAR agonists. This suggests that NMDARs are excluded from the axon. In contrast, local GABA(A) receptor activation alters axonal excitability, indicating that exclusion of ligand-gated ion channels from the axon is not absolute. Because NMDARs are restricted to the dendrite, NMDARs must signal to the axon by an indirect mechanism to alter release. Although subthreshold somatic depolarizations were found to spread electrotonically hundreds of micrometers through the axon, the resulting axonal potential was insufficient to open voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels. Therefore, if NMDAR-mediated facilitation of release is cell autonomous, it may depend on voltage signaling but apparently is independent of changes in basal Ca(2+). Alternatively, this facilitation may be even less direct, requiring a cascade of events that are merely triggered by NMDAR activation.",M1
19336905,"In vivo transdermal delivery of diclofenac by <e>ion</e>-exchange iontophoresis with geraniol.A novel iontophoretic system utilizing ion-exchange membranes is effective for selective transdermal delivery of ionized drugs. In the present study, we examined in vivo availability and safety of ion-exchange iontophoresis in the transdermal delivery of anionic diclofenac, a well known anti-inflammatory medication, to rat dorsal skin. While iontophoresis increased the plasma concentration of diclofenac sodium and skin injury was not observed, no anti-inflammatory effect was exerted. To enhance the efficiency of transdermal delivery of diclofenac sodium, iontophoresis was combined with topical application of one of three terpenes (menthol, nerolidol or geraniol) as chemical enhancers. By combining iontophoresis with geraniol, the plasma concentration of diclofenac sodium increased over 20-fold, and suppression of inflammation was achieved. Skin irritation was not seen even after 1.5 h iontophoresis. The enhancing effect of geraniol is attributed to increased penetration of the drug into the stratum corneum as well as enhanced transport across the anion-exchange membrane. Ion-exchange iontophoresis combined with geraniol is a highly effective transdermal delivery system.",M1
19267187,"Effects of ionic strength on passive and iontophoretic transport of cationic permeant across human nail.PURPOSE: Transport across the human nail under hydration can be modeled as hindered transport across aqueous pore pathways. As such, nail permselectivity to charged species can be manipulated by changing the ionic strength of the system in transungual delivery to treat nail diseases. The present study investigated the effects of ionic strength upon transungual passive and iontophoretic transport. METHODS: Transungual passive and anodal iontophoretic transport experiments of tetraethylammonium <e>ion</e> (TEA) were conducted under symmetric conditions in which the donor and receiver had the same ionic strength in vitro. Experiments under asymmetric conditions were performed to mimic the in vivo conditions. Prior to the transport studies, TEA uptake studies were performed to assess the partitioning of TEA into the nail. RESULTS: Permselectivity towards TEA was inversely related to ionic strength in both passive and iontophoretic transport. The permeability and transference number of TEA were higher at lower ionic strengths under the symmetric conditions due to increased partitioning of TEA into the nail. Transference numbers were smaller under the asymmetric conditions compared with their symmetric counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate significant ionic strength effects upon the partitioning and transport of a cationic permeant in transungual transport, which may be instrumental in the development of transungual delivery systems.",M1
19041698,"<e>Ion</e>-exchange membrane assisted transdermal iontophoretic delivery of salicylate and acyclovir.The presence of endogenous competing counterions is a main reason for the generally low efficiency of transdermal iontophoretic drug delivery. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the incorporation of an ion-exchange membrane (Ionac) in an iontophoresis system to hinder transdermal transport of these counterions can enhance iontophoretic delivery. The properties of Ionac were characterized in passive and iontophoretic transport experiments. Iontophoretic transport across human epidermal membrane (HEM) and across HEM in series with Ionac was then studied. To assess the effect of HEM electrical resistance upon Ionac-assisted iontophoresis, HEM resistance was reduced in the iontophoresis experiments with alternating current (AC). Salicylate (SA) was the negatively charged permeant first tested in this study. Mannitol was the model permeant to examine the effects of electroosmosis. At the completion of the SA study, experiments were performed with acyclovir (ACV), an antiviral drug with limited water solubility. When Ionac was used to enhance SA transdermal fluxes, higher SA fluxes were observed with HEM of lower resistances in Ionac-assisted iontophoresis. Up to a four-fold flux enhancement was achieved when the electrical resistance of HEM was reduced using an AC iontophoresis method. For ACV, two-fold flux enhancement was observed in Ionac-assisted iontophoresis compared with the conventional iontophoresis baseline. In all experiments, the contribution of electroosmosis to drug transport was less than 10%. The present study has demonstrated the potential of a new approach using a positively charged ion-exchange membrane to enhance transdermal iontophoretic transport of negatively charged drugs.",M1
18719003,"In vitro optimization of dexamethasone phosphate delivery by iontophoresis.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of competing <e>ions</e> and electroosmosis on the transdermal iontophoresis of dexamethasone phosphate (Dex-Phos) and to identify the optimal conditions for its delivery. METHODS: The experiments were performed using pig skin, in side-by-side diffusion cells (0.78 cm(2)), passing a constant current of 0.3 mA via Ag-AgCl electrodes. Dex-Phos transport was quantified for donor solutions (anodal and cathodal) containing different drug concentrations, with and without background electrolyte. Electrotransport of co-ion, citrate, and counterions Na(+) and K(+) also was quantified. The contribution of electroosmosis was evaluated by measuring the transport of the neutral marker (mannitol). RESULTS: Electromigration was the dominant mechanism of drug iontophoresis, and reduction in electroosmotic flow directed against the cathodic delivery of Dex-Phos did not improve drug delivery. The Dex-Phos flux from the cathode was found to be optimal (transport number of approximately 0.012) when background electrolyte was excluded from the formulation. In this case, transport of the drug is limited principally by the competition with counterions (mainly Na(+) with a transport number of approximately 0.8) and the mobility of the drug in the membrane. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Dex-Phos must be delivered from the cathode and formulated rationally, excluding mobile co-anions, to achieve optimal iontophoretic delivery.",M1
18321669,"Chemical method to enhance transungual transport and iontophoresis efficiency.Transungual transport is hindered by the inherent small effective pore size of the nail even when it is fully hydrated. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of chemical enhancers thioglycolic acid (TGA), glycolic acid (GA), and urea (UR) on transungual transport and iontophoresis efficiency. In vitro passive and iontophoretic transport experiments of model permeants mannitol (MA), UR, and tetraethylammonium (TEA) <e>ion</e> across the fully hydrated, enhancer-treated and untreated human nail plates were performed in phosphate-buffered saline. The transport experiments consisted of several stages, alternating between passive and anodal iontophoretic transport at 0.1mA. Nail water uptake experiments were conducted to determine the water content of the enhancer-treated nails. The effects of the enhancers on transungual electroosmosis were also evaluated. Nails treated with GA and UR did not show any transport enhancement. Treatment with TGA at 0.5M enhanced passive and iontophoretic transungual transport of MA, UR, and TEA. Increasing the TGA concentration to 1.8M did not further increase TEA iontophoresis efficiency. The effect of TGA on the nail plates was irreversible. The present study shows the possibility of using a chemical enhancer to reduce transport hindrance in the nail plate and thus enhance passive and iontophoretic transungual transport.",M1
18289555,"Hard modeling of <e>ion</e> chromatography separations on hydroxide-selective stationary phase.In the present paper the development and testing of the computer software for the simulation of the on-column ion chromatography separation processes are presented. The computer algorithm based exclusively on the selectivity coefficients of the tested analytes has been upgraded to cope with the 2:1 and 1:1 ratios of the analyte-to-eluent ion charge. The analytical solution of the cubic equation, which is needed for calculation of chromatograms for doubly charged analytes in the presence of singly charged eluent, is presented. The developed modeling approach was tested on the data sets produced by the system composed of hydroxide-selective stationary phase in combination with on-line electrolytically generated OH(-)-based eluents. Retention behavior of the selected anions on the AS15 (DIONEX, USA) stationary phase was investigated. The study of the dependence of the peak widths on the number of theoretical column segments considered in the calculated chromatograms enabled us to choose the optimal number of column segments. The average error in the retention time of the calculated chromatograms for the data set used in the study, i.e. seven different ions at eight different eluent concentrations was found to be 1.4%. A good match with the experimental chromatograms allows us to use the information of the intermediate states of calculations to get a detailed insight into the time-dependent on-column analyte distribution.",M1
18057755,"A study of the calcium complex of a glucosylceramide, soya-cerebroside II.In order to study calcium <e>ion</e> complex of soya-cerebroside II (1), an ionophoretic glucosylceramide isolated from soybean, C8-cerebroside (3) and 3,3'',6''-trideoxy-C8-cerebroside (4) are designed and synthesized. On the basis of extensive 1H-NMR studies in the presence of Ca2+ and a continuous variation method via (1)H-NMR, soya-cerebroside II is suggested to form a calcium complex with 1/Ca2+ ratio of 1 : 1. Soya-cerebroside II serves as a tridentate chelating ligand for Ca2+; the amide carbonyl, C2'-hydroxy, and C2''-hydroxy oxygens are responsible for the Ca2+ binding. Soya-cerebroside II is structurally analogous to a neural glucosylceramide. Thus, the accumulated neural glucosylceramide inside of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane may serve as an endogenous Ca2+-binding and -transport molecule (ionophore) that result in mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular calcium stores.",M1
18035848,"Elimination and exchange of trifluoroacetate counter-<e>ion</e> from cationic peptides: a critical evaluation of different approaches.Most synthesized peptides are nowadays produced using solid-phase procedures. Due to cleavage and purification conditions, they are mainly obtained in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and, for cationic peptides, as trifluoroacetate (TF-acetate) salts. However, TF-acetate interferes with physicochemical characterizations using infrared spectroscopy and might significantly affect the in vivo studies. Thus, TF-acetate exchange by another counter-ion is often required. Up to now, the classical procedure has consisted of freeze-drying the peptide several times in the presence of an excess of a stronger acid than TFA (pKa approximately 0): generally HCl (pKa = - 7). This approach means that working at pH &lt; 1 can induce peptide degradation. We therefore tested three different approaches to exchange the tightly bound TF-acetate counter-ion from the dicationic octapeptide lanreotide: (i) reverse-phase HPLC, (ii) ion-exchange resin, and (iii) deprotonation/reprotonation cycle of the amino groups. The first two approaches allow the partial to almost complete exchange of the TF-acetate counter-ion by another ion from an acid weaker than TFA, such as acetic acid (pKa = 4.5), and the third requires a basic solution that permits the complete removal of TF-acetate counter-ion. The efficiency of these three procedures was tested and compared by using different analytical techniques such as 19F-NMR, 1H-NMR and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR). We also show that ATR-IR can be used to monitor the TFA removal. The counter-ion exchange procedures described in this study are easy to carry out, fast, harmless and reproducible. Moreover, two of them offer the very interesting possibility of exchanging the initial TF-acetate by any other counter-ion.",M1
17990310,"Iontophoretic transport across a multiple membrane system.The objective of the present study was to investigate the iontophoretic transport behavior across multiple membranes of different barrier properties. Spectra/Por(R) (SP) and Ionac membranes were the synthetic membranes and sclera was the biomembrane in this model study. The barrier properties of SP membranes were determined individually in passive and iontophoresis transport experiments with tetraethylammonium <e>ion</e> (TEA), chloride ion (Cl), and mannitol as the model permeants. Passive and iontophoretic transport experiments were then conducted with an assembly of SP membranes. The contribution of electroosmosis to iontophoresis was assessed using the mannitol data. Model analysis was performed to study the contribution of diffusion and electromigration to electrotransport across the multiple membrane system. The effects of membrane barrier thickness upon ion-exchange membrane-enhanced iontophoresis were examined with Ionac, SP, and sclera. The present study shows that iontophoretic transport of TEA across the membrane system was related to the thicknesses and permeability coefficients of the membranes and the electromobilities of the permeant across the individual membranes in the assembly. Model analysis suggests significant contribution of diffusion within the membranes across the membrane system, and this mechanism is relatively independent of the current density applied across the system in iontophoresis dominant transport.",M1
17915587,"[Transcorneal and transscleral iontophoresis of the dexamethasone phosphate into the rabbit eye]PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficiency of the dexamethasone phosphate penetration into the rabbit eye after transcorneal and transscleral iontophoresis using a drug loaded hydrogel assembled on a portable iontophoretic Mini <e>Ion</e> device. METHODS: lontophoresis of dexamethasone phosphate was studied in healthy rabbits using drug-loaded disposable HEMA hydrogel sponges and portable iontophoretic device. Corneal iontophoretic administration was performed with electric current of 1 mAmp for 1, 2, and 4 min. In the control group, the dexamethasone was applied in drops into the conjunctival sac. Transconjunctival and transscleral iontophoresis were performed in the pars plana area, through the conjunctiva or directly on the sclera. Dexamethasone concentrations were assayed using HPLC method. To study the anatomical changes after iontophoresis application, histological examinations of corneas excised 5 minutes and 8 hours after the procedure were performed. RESULTS: Dexamethasone levels in the rabbits' corneas after a single transcorneal iontophoresis were up to 38 times higher compared to those obtained after topical eye drops instillation. High drug concentrations were obtained in the retina and sclera 4 hours after transscleral iontophoresis as well. There were no statistically significant differences in the drug concentration after transscleral and tranconjunctival iontophoresis. Histological examination of the corneas after the iontophoresis showed only discrete reversible changes of the epithelium and the stroma. CONCLUSION: A short, low-current, non-invasive iontophoretic treatment using the dexamethasone-loaded hydrogels has a potential clinical value in increasing the drug's penetration into the anterior and posterior segment of the eye.",M1
17879296,"Examination of barriers and barrier alteration in transscleral iontophoresis.The flux enhancing mechanisms of transscleral iontophoresis are not well understood. The objective of the present study was to investigate the ocular barrier and barrier alterations in transscleral iontophoretic delivery with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Experiments involving constant current transscleral iontophoresis of 2 mA (current density 10 mA/cm(2)) and subconjunctival injection were conducted with rabbits in vivo and postmortem and with excised sclera in side-by-side diffusion cells in vitro. The postmortem and in vitro experiments were expected to be helpful in clarifying the importance of vascular clearance and other transport barriers in transscleral iontophoresis. Manganese <e>ion</e> (Mn(2+)) and manganese ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid complex (MnEDTA(2-)) were the model permeants. The results show that pretreatment of the eye with an electric field by iontophoresis enhanced subconjunctival delivery of the permeants to the anterior segment of the eye in vivo. This suggests that electric field-induced barrier alterations can be an important absorption enhancing mechanism of ocular iontophoresis. Penetration enhancement was magnified in the postmortem experiments with larger amounts of the permeants delivered into the eye and to the back of the eye. The different results observed in the in vivo and postmortem studies can be attributed to ocular clearance in ocular delivery.",M1
17767200,"Comparison of the therapeutic efficacy of phonophoresis and iontophoresis using dexamethasone sodium phosphate in the management of patients with knee osteoarthritis.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Many treatment options, including non-pharmacological and pharmacological measures, have been recommended in the management of osteoarthritis (OA). Among the non-pharmacological approach is physiotherapy, which involves the use of physical modalities like, heat therapy, exercise therapy, electrical stimulation, therapeutic ultrasound, iontophoresis, and phonophoresis. This study was therefore designed to compare the effectiveness of 0.4% Dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DEX-P) phonophoresis (PH) with 0.4% DEX-P iontophoresis (<e>ION</e>) therapy in the management of patients with knee joint OA. METHODS: Fifty patients (19 males and 31 females) with a mean age of 53.6 +/- 8.9 years were randomly assigned to PH or ION groups with 25 patients in each group. Ultrasound waves of 1 MHz frequency was applied for 5 minutes to the target knee, so also was the direct current for 10 minutes for 10 sessions treatment period. Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, 20 meters ambulatory time, and knee range of motion (ROM) were evaluated before and after therapy as the outcome measures. RESULTS: At the end of two weeks, significant improvement in total WOMAC scores was observed in 15 (60%) and 16 (64%) patients in the PH and ION groups respectively, indicating no significant difference in the improvement rate. Twenty (20) metres ambulatory time and knee range of motion also improved significantly in both groups, yet these variables showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Both therapeutic modalities were found to be effective and generally well tolerated after 10 treatment sessions. DEX-P phonophoresis was not superior to DEX-P iontophoresis in the treatment of patients with OA of the knee.",M1
17707106,"Quantitative structure-permeation relationship for iontophoretic transport across the skin.The objective was to relate the efficiency of a charged drug to carry current across the skin during iontophoresis to its structural and/or physicochemical properties. The corollary was the establishment of a predictive relationship useful to predict the feasibility of iontophoretic drug delivery, and for the selection and optimization of drug candidates for this route of administration. A dataset of 16 cations, for which iontophoretic fluxes have been measured under identical conditions, with no competition from exogenous co-<e>ions</e>, was compiled. Maximum transport numbers correlated with ion mobilities and decreased with ionic size, the dependence indicating that the electromigration mechanism of iontophoresis would become negligible for drugs of hydrodynamic radius greater than about 8 A. Validation of the model was demonstrated by successfully predicting the transport numbers of three structurally distinct dipeptides, the iontophoretic data for which had been determined under distinctly different experimental conditions. Finally, for the  training  set of cations, a strong linear dependence between their transport numbers in skin and those in aqueous solution was demonstrated; the former were larger by approximately a factor of 1.4 consistent with skin's cation permselectivity. In conclusion, this research offers a practical contribution to the development of a predictive structure-transport model of iontophoresis.",M1
17683062,"Transungual iontophoretic transport of polar neutral and positively charged model permeants: effects of electrophoresis and electroosmosis.Transungual iontophoretic transport of model neutral permeants mannitol (MA), urea (UR), and positively charged permeant tetraethylammonium <e>ion</e> (TEA) across fully hydrated human nail plates at pH 7.4 were investigated in vitro. Four protocols were involved in the transport experiments with each protocol divided into stages including passive and iontophoresis transport of 0.1 and 0.3 mA. Water and permeant uptake experiments of nail clippings were also conducted to characterize the hydration and binding effects of the permeants to the nails. Iontophoresis enhanced the transport of MA and UR from anode to cathode, but this effect (electroosmosis) was marginal. The transport of TEA was significantly enhanced by anodal iontophoresis and the experimental enhancement factors were consistent with the Nernst-Planck theory predictions. Hindered transport was also observed and believed to be critical in transungual delivery. The barrier of the nail plates was stable over the time course of the study, and no significant electric field-induced alteration of the barrier was observed. The present results with hydrated nail plates are consistent with electrophoresis-dominant (the direct field effect) transungual iontophoretic transport of small ionic permeants with small contribution from electroosmosis.",M1
17510177,"Dendritic Ca2+ signalling due to activation of alpha 7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in rat hippocampal neurons.Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are in the superfamily of Cys-loop ligand-gated <e>ion</e> channels, which are widely expressed in the brain. Among the many different subtypes of nAChRs known to be expressed in the rat brain, the alpha 7-containing nAChRs are considered to be the most permeable to Ca2+. Utilizing highly localized and rapid iontophoretic agonist delivery, combined with patch-clamp electrophysiology and fura-2 fluorescence imaging techniques, we examined the alpha 7 nAChR-mediated currents and [Ca2+]i transients in the dendrites of rat hippocampal CA1 interneurons in the slice. We found that in the dendrites, whereas the amplitudes of the current responses were smaller and the decay kinetics faster than the responses in the soma, the amplitudes of the [Ca2+]i signals were significantly larger. Cultured hippocampal neurons were studied since the dendritic field lies in the same focal plane, which allowed for a broader investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of [Ca2+]i signalling. In cultured neurons, the [Ca2+]i signals in the dendrites were similar to those in slices. Interestingly in cultures, even though the amplitude of the alpha 7 nAChR-mediated currents dramatically decreased with distance from the soma (from approximately 20-250 microm), the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i signals did not correlate with distance. This indicates that the relative efficacy of alpha 7 nAChR activation to increase [Ca2+]i levels in dendrites increased severalfold with distance from the soma. These results may have implications for the role that alpha 7 nAChRs have in regulating various signal transduction cascades, synaptic plasticity, and memory processes, via significant changes in [Ca(2+)]i levels.",M1
17236728,"Examination of penetration routes and distribution of ionic permeants during and after transscleral iontophoresis with magnetic resonance imaging.Previously, transscleral and transcorneal iontophoretic delivery was studied and compared to passive delivery and intravitreal injection using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The objective of the present study was to employ MRI to further investigate the factors affecting transscleral iontophoretic delivery. In the present study, anodal and cathodal constant current transscleral iontophoresis were conducted with excised sclera in side-by-side diffusion cells in vitro and with rabbits in vivo. The total current and duration of application were 2 and 4mA (current density 10 and 20mA/cm(2)) and 20-60min, respectively. The delivery and distribution of the model permeants manganese <e>ion</e> (Mn(2+)) and manganese ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid complex (MnEDTA(2-)) into the eye during iontophoresis were determined with MRI and compared with the results obtained in previous studies of subconjunctival injection and passive delivery. Both anodal and cathodal iontophoresis provided significant enhancement in ocular delivery compared to passive transport in the in vitro and in vivo experiments. Transscleral iontophoretic delivery was related to the position and duration of the iontophoresis application in vivo. Permeants were observed to be delivered primarily into the anterior segment of the eye when the pars plana was the application site. Extending the duration of iontophoresis at this site allowed the permeants to be delivered into the vitreous more deeply and to a greater extent than when the application site was at the back of the eye near the fornix. The present results show that electrode placement was an important factor in transscleral iontophoresis, and the ciliary body (pars plana) was determined to be the pathway of least resistance for iontophoretic transport. These new findings continue to support the utility of MRI as a noninvasive technique in ocular drug delivery research and testing.",M1
17069752,"Role of membrane curvature in mechanoelectrical transduction: <e>ion</e> carriers nonactin and valinomycin sense changes in integral bending energy.We describe the phenomenon of mechanoelectrical transduction in macroscopic lipid bilayer membranes modified by two cation-selective ionophores, valinomycin and nonactin. We found that bulging these membranes, while maintaining the membrane tension constant, produced a marked supralinear increase in specific carrier-mediated conductance. Analyses of the mechanisms involved in mechanoelectrical transduction induced by the imposition of a hydrostatic pressure gradient or by an amphipathic compound chlorpromazine reveal similar changes in the charge carrier motility and carrier reaction rates at the interface(s). Furthermore, the relative change in membrane conductance was independent of membrane diameter, but was directly proportional to the square of membrane curvature, thus relating the observed phenomena to the bilayer bending energy. Extrapolated to biological membranes, these findings indicate that ion transport in cells can be influenced simply by changing shape of the membrane, without a change in membrane tension.",M1
16963208,"Release characteristics of anionic drug compounds from liquid crystalline gels III. Chemical and iontophoretic enhancement of delivery across non-rate-limiting membranes.This paper investigates the release and transport of a range of anionic drugs from liquid crystalline gels using chemical and physical enhancement techniques.

This paper investigates the behaviour of the system under iontophoretic conditions and also under those of combined physical and chemical enhancement. The data presented here are directly comparable to previous work by Nolan et al. [; Nolan, L.M.A., Corish, J., Corrigan, O.I., Fitzpatrick, D., 2006. Combined effects of iontophoretic and chemical enhancement on drug delivery. II. Transport across human and hairless murine skin. Int. J.

The iontophoretic release of diclofenac in the presence of model enhancers is thoroughly investigated. It is also shown that a range of anionic drug molecules undergo an electrochemical change during the course of the experiments which leads to their poor detection. This may be a factor in the under reporting of iontophoretic delivery of anionic drugs in the literature. However, it has been shown that the transport of the drugs is greatly enhanced by the application of an iontophoretic current. Results of combined enhancement studies provide a positive basis on which to proceed with in vitro studies of the system across human skin.",M1
16841198,"Enhanced transscleral lontophoretic transport with <e>ion</e>-exchange membrane.PURPOSE: Transscleral iontophoresis has been recently re-examined for drug delivery to the back of the eye. In conventional iontophoresis, due to the relatively high electromobility of the endogenous competing ions (counterions) relative to that of the drug ion in the tissue barrier, the efficiency of iontophoretic drug delivery is generally low. The objective of the present study was to examine ion-exchange membrane-enhanced transscleral iontophoretic transport in which the ion-exchange membrane in series with the sclera can hinder the transport of the competing counterions and selectively allow the transport of the permeant across the sclera. METHODS: The physical properties of the Ionac ion-exchange membrane and excised rabbit sclera were determined in equilibrium uptake experiments and in passive and iontophoretic transport experiments with salicylate, tetraethylammonium, urea, and mannitol. Transscleral experiments with the ion-exchange membrane were conducted with salicylate and excised rabbit sclera in vitro. The contribution of electroosmosis to electrotransport during transscleral iontophoresis was assessed with urea and mannitol. RESULTS: The ion-exchange membrane is highly positively charged and has a small effective pore size. The sclera is relatively porous with a large effective pore size and low pore tortuosity. The sclera is also net negatively charged but this does not significantly affect the transport of small ions. A three-fold steady-state transscleral flux enhancement of salicylate was observed in ion-exchange membrane-enhanced iontophoresis over conventional transscleral iontophoresis without the membrane. Such enhancement was relatively independent of the applied electric current density and the thickness of the studied ion-exchange membrane assembly. Although the ion-exchange membrane altered transscleral electroosmosis, the contribution of electroosmosis to electrotransport was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The present study has demonstrated the potential of ion-exchange membranes for enhancing iontophoretic transport and drug delivery.",M1
16758757,"[Delivery of gentamicin to the rabbit eye using hydrogel and iontophoresis]The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of solid hydrogel as a probe for the drug delivery to the rabbit eye upon application of low current iontophoresis. Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), cross-linked with ethylenglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) were prepared to form solid hydrogels. The concentrations of gentamicin sulfate in different segments of rabbit eye after transconjunctival and transscleral iontophoresis were also studied. For iontophoresis we used a portable Mini <e>Ion</e> device (designed at Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and applied a current from 0 mA to 1.5 mA for pre-set period from 30 to 120 seconds and after application the concentrations of gentamicin in cornea were assayed. The rabbits in control group were treated with fortified gentamicin eye-drops (concentration 1.4 %). The highest concentration of gentamicin sulfate was reached after iontophoresis with current intensity of 1.5 mA applied for 60 s. High gentamicin concentration were found in the retina and in the sclera four hours after transscleral iontophoresis, the lowest concentration was obtained in vitreous. The delivery of gentamicin to the eye via iontophoresis with solid HEMA/EGDMA hydrogels seems to be promising method achieving high concentrations of the drug in the eye tissue.",M1
16701973,"The delivery of ketoprofen from a system containing <e>ion</e>-exchange fibers.A postulated model for transdermal delivery using ion-exchange fibers as controlling device was designed, and the main objective of this study was to assess the rationality of the model. The release rates of ketoprofen from the carbopol-based gel vehicles containing ion-exchange fibers to which the ketoprofen had been bound have been determined across 0.22 microm microporous membrane. The fluctuation of the release rate of ketoprofen from the vehicles was much lower compared with that of simple gels, though the cumulative amount of ketoprofen delivery was less. Additional ions could increase the rate and extent of ketoprofen delivery. The iontophoretically assisted transport of ketoprofen across rat skin was also studied and found to be favorable to ketoprofen permeation. According to the tested model, the ion-layer could enhance the ketoprofen delivery and satisfactory results were achieved.",M1
16488047,"Prediction of iontophoretic transport across the skin.The objective of this work was to demonstrate that the efficiency of iontophoretic transport across the skin (which is measured in terms of an <e>ion</e>'s transport number), either for drug delivery or for therapeutic drug monitoring, depends implicitly on the molar fraction of the species of interest over a wide range of experimental conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Three sets of data from the literature were assessed to establish the direct relationship between transport number and mole fraction. Linear regression between these parameters yielded slopes which correlated with the charge-carrying efficiency of the ion considered. The latter, furthermore, was proportional to the corresponding aqueous mobility and to the transport number of the ion when it is the sole species available for migration from its electrode solution (the so-called  single-carrier  situation). Finally, the principles illustrated here were equally applicable to in vitro experiments and to in vivo data obtained in a clinically relevant study (specifically, the reverse iontophoretic monitoring of lithiemia in bipolar patients). Not only does this validate an in vitro model typically used in iontophoresis research, it also demonstrates the potential of this approach to predict the feasibility of iontophoretic transport across the skin.",M1
16443654,"Transport numbers in transdermal iontophoresis.Parameters determining ionic transport numbers in transdermal iontophoresis have been characterized. The transport number of an <e>ion</e> (its ability to carry charge) is key to its iontophoretic delivery or extraction across the skin. Using small inorganic ions, the roles of molar fraction and mobility of the co- and counterions present have been demonstrated. A direct, constant current was applied across mammalian skin in vitro. Cations were anodally delivered from either simple M(+)Cl(-) solutions (single-ion case, M(+) = sodium, lithium, ammonium, potassium), or binary and quaternary mixtures thereof. Transport numbers were deduced from ion fluxes. In the single-ion case, maximum cationic fluxes directly related to the corresponding ionic aqueous mobilities were found. Addition of co-ions decreased the transport numbers of all cations relative to the single-ion case, the degree of effect depending upon the molar fraction and mobility of the species involved. With chloride as the principal counterion competing to carry current across the skin (the in vivo situation), a maximum limit on the single or collective cation transport number was 0.6-0.8. Overall, these results demonstrate how current flowing across the skin during transdermal iontophoresis is distributed between competing ions, and establish simple rules with which to optimize transdermal iontophoretic transport.",M1

Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was utilized to probe initial BLM resistivity, the insertion of alamethicin pores, and mass transport across the membrane. Acquired SECM images show the spatial location of inserted pore bundles, the verification of voltage control over the pore conformational state (open/closed), and variations in passive mass transport corresponding to different topographical areas of the BLM. SECM images were also used to evaluate overall BLM integrity prior to insertion as well as transport (flux in open state) and leakage (flux in closed state) currents following insertion.",M1
16419050,"Electromigration of <e>ions</e> across the skin: determination and prediction of transport numbers.In iontophoresis, an electric field across the skin induces electromigration of exogenously applied and endogenously present ions. The approach can be used to improve dramatically drug delivery by elimination of competing co-ions in the externally applied formulation, as this maximizes the fraction of current carried by (i.e., the transport number of) the drug. In this study, the dependence of the transport number on the nature of the ions present at the anode and cathode was examined using 12 different combinations of ions (4 cations x 3 anions). Cationic transport numbers (t(C+) (o)) were a function of their inherent mobilities and depended upon those of the single anion at the cathode; however, t(C+) (o) was independent of the counter-ion concentration. The extensive data obtained agreed well, furthermore, with a theoretical framework previously developed for this so-called  single-ion  situation. In addition, there was a strong correlation between ionic transport numbers in the skin and those in aqueous solution, which are easily estimated from measurements of ionic mobility. It follows that it should be possible, from the framework developed here, to establish a predictive tool, combining theory with simple experiments, for the optimization of iontophoretic drug delivery.",M1
16289410,"Evaluation of constant current alternating current iontophoresis for transdermal drug delivery.Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that alternating current (AC) iontophoresis can significantly decrease skin electric resistance and enhance the transport of charged permeants across skin. Flux variability of neutral permeants during AC iontophoresis was also found to be less than that of conventional direct current (DC) iontophoresis. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate flux enhancement of constant current AC transdermal iontophoresis and compare the AC flux with that of constant current DC iontophoresis. Iontophoresis studies of AC amplitude of 1, 2, and 5 mA were conducted in side-by-side diffusion cells with donor solution of 0.015, 0.15, and 1.0 M tetraethylammonium (TEA) chloride and receiver solution of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) using human epidermal membrane (HEM). Conventional constant current DC iontophoresis of 0.2 mA was also performed under similar conditions. TEA and mannitol were the model permeants. The following are the major findings in the present study. The flux of TEA increased proportionally with the AC current for all three TEA chloride concentrations and at the AC frequency used in the present study. When the permeant and its counter <e>ion</e> were the only ionic species in the donor chamber, the fluxes during DC iontophoresis were weakly dependent of its donor concentration. The fluxes of TEA during constant current AC iontophoresis were moderately related to the donor concentration with the highest TEA flux observed under the 1.0 M TEA chloride condition although the relationship between flux and donor concentration was not linear. A trend of decreasing electroosmotic transport with increasing donor TEA chloride concentration was observed with significant sample-to-sample variability during DC iontophoresis. Mannitol permeability was also observed to decrease with increasing TEA chloride concentration in the donor under the AC conditions, but data variability under AC was significantly smaller than that under DC. The results in the present study indicate that constant current AC iontophoresis under conditions tolerable to human (2 and 5 mA) can provide predictable fluxes that were lower than but of comparable magnitude as those of conventional constant current DC iontophoresis (0.2 mA).",M1
16258195,"Regulation of S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) binding to tumor cells by zinc <e>ion</e> and its implication for apoptosis-inducing activity.S100A8/A9 (calprotectin), which is released by neutrophils under inflammatory conditions, has the capacity to induce apoptosis in various cells. We previously reported that S100A8/A9 induces apoptosis of EL-4 lymphoma cells via the uptake of extracellular zinc in a manner similar to DTPA, a membrane-impermeable zinc chelator. In this study, S100A8/A9-induced apoptosis was examined in several cell lines that are weakly sensitive to DTPA, suggesting S100A8/A9 is directly responsible for apoptosis in these cells. Since zinc inhibits apoptosis of MM46, one of these cells, the regulation by zinc of the capacity of S100A8/A9 to bind MM46 cells was studied. When MM46 cells were incubated with S100A8/A9 in standard or zinc-depleted medium, the amounts of S100A8/A9 bound to cells was markedly lower at 3 h than at 1 h. In contrast, when MM46 cells were incubated with S100A8/A9 in the presence of high levels of zinc, binding to cells was the same at 1 and 3 h. When the cells were permeabilized with saponin prior to analysis, a larger amount of cell-associated S100A8/A9 was detected at 3 h. The amount was further increased in cells treated with chloroquine, suggesting that S100A8/A9 was internalized and degraded in lysosomes. Although it has been reported that S100A8/A9 binds to heparan sulfate on cell membranes, the amount of S100A8/A9 bound to MM46 cells was not reduced by heparinase treatment, but was reduced by trypsin treatment. These results suggest that S100A8/A9 induces apoptosis by direct binding to MM46 cells, and that this activity is regulated by zinc.",M1
16170597,"Effect of charge and molecular weight on transdermal peptide delivery by iontophoresis.PURPOSE: The study was conducted to investigate the impact of charge and molecular weight (MW) on the iontophoretic delivery of a series of dipeptides. METHODS: Constant current iontophoresis of lysine and 10 variously charged lysine- and tyrosine-containing dipeptides was performed in vitro. RESULTS: Increasing MW was compensated by additional charge; for example, Lys (MW = 147 Da, +1) and H-Lys-Lys-OH (MW = 275 Da, +2) had equivalent steady-state fluxes of 225 +/- 48 and 218 +/- 40 nmol cm(-2) h(-1), respectively. For peptides with similar MW, e.g., H-Tyr-D-Arg-OH (MW = 337 Da, +1) and H-Tyr-D-Arg-NH(2) (MW = 336 Da, +2), the higher valence <e>ion</e> displayed greater flux (150 +/- 26 vs. 237 +/- 35 nmol cm(-2) h(-1)). Hydrolysis of dipeptides with unblocked N-terminal residues, after passage through the stratum corneum, suggested the involvement of aminopeptidases. The iontophoretic flux of zwitterionic dipeptides was less than that of acetaminophen and dependent on pH. CONCLUSIONS: For the series of dipeptides studied, flux is linearly correlated to the charge/MW ratio. Data for zwitterionic peptides indicate that they do not behave as neutral ( charge-less ) molecules, but that their iontophoretic transport is dependent on the relative extents of ionization of the constituent ionizable groups, which may also be affected by neighboring amino acids.",M1
16084043,"Release characteristics of anionic drug compounds from liquid crystalline gels I: Passive release across non-rate-limiting membranes.Liquid crystalline gels (LCG) offer the formulator dynamic and flexible vehicles, into which actives, enhancers and other adjuvants with a wide range of physicochemical properties can be incorporated. This is achievable because of the biphasic oil/water composition of the gel. In this paper, the suitability of an isotropic liquid crystalline gel is investigated for a range of anionic drug molecules, with particular emphasis on sodium diclofenac. Parameters, which have been investigated, include the mode of vehicle preparation, the effect of the concentration of the drug and how buffering the gel and/or the receptor medium affect the release profiles. Such profiles have been measured for the sodium salts of benzoate, salicylate and indomethacin. The passive release from the standard system was found to adhere to matrix-controlled diffusion. An increase in concentration leads to a non-linear increase in the cumulative release of sodium diclofenac from the gels. In direct contrast to the result reported for cationic salbutamol base, optimum release from the gel was achieved when neither the receptor medium nor the aqueous phase of the gel was buffered. The percentages released of the sodium salts of benzoate, salicylate and indomethacin, after 24 h, were determined to be 25, 26 and 19%, respectively, and these are significantly greater than the release of sodium diclofenac. This suggests that diclofenac undergoes <e>ion</e>-pairing or complexation within the gel, which inhibits its diffusion from the vehicle. Future papers will report on the incorporation of enhancers and the effects of iontophoresis on the release profiles of drugs from these gels, and ultimately on the transdermal transport of drugs from these vehicles across human and porcine skin.",M1
16023921,"Characterization of efferent projections of chemosensitive neurons in the caudal parapyramidal area of the rat brain.The caudal parapyramidal area of the rat brain contains a population of neurons that are highly sensitive to an increase in the extracellular hydrogen <e>ion</e> concentration ([H+]o). Some of them fire synchronously with respiration when [H+]o is increased. These chemosensitive neurons are located in the caudal ventrolateral medulla in a medial region, closest to the pyramidal tract, and a lateral region, beneath the lateral reticular nucleus. To assess the nature of medullary connections, biotinylated dextran amine injections were performed after recordings from the neurons had been completed. The injections were located within the areas containing serotonergic neurons of the caudal parapyramidal area. The injections within the medial and lateral parts of the caudal parapyramidal region revealed bilateral terminal fields of varicosities within the nucleus of the solitary tract and the ventral respiratory column. Efferent bilateral projections to the lateral paragigantocellular, lateral reticular, and inferior olive nuclei, as well as ipsilateral projections to medial and lateral caudal parapyramidal regions were also identified. Efferent projections towards the raphe obscurus from both medial and lateral caudal parapyramidal regions were found. Medial caudal parapyramidal regions also sent efferent projections towards the raphe pallidus, B1-B3 region, and to the dorsal and ventral parts of the medullary reticular nuclei. The detection of H(+)-sensitive neurons in the caudal parapyramidal area and their projections towards the nucleus of the solitary tract and to the ventral respiratory column, associated with respiratory regulation, indicate that this region could be an excellent candidate for central chemoreception.",M1
15939235,"Roles of the conjunctiva in ocular drug delivery: a review of conjunctival transport mechanisms and their regulation.Conjunctiva plays many roles including protection of ocular surface, production of tear film, and a conduit for drug clearance (depending on drug properties) into the systemic circulation or for drug transport to the deep tissues of the eye. The conjunctiva, which is a moderately tight epithelium, endowed with various transport processes for the homeostasis of <e>ions</e>, solutes, and water in the conjunctival surface and tear film. Modulation of ion transport in the conjunctiva leads to alterations in transconjunctival fluid flow that may become useful for treatment of dry-eye state in the eye. As a possible drug delivery route to the posterior portion of the eye, conjunctiva is an attractive route due to both larger surface area than that of cornea and expression of several key transport processes. Tear contains D-glucose and many amino acids, in addition to the usual ions in the body fluids. Several ion-coupled solute transport processes for absorption of amino acids, D-glucose, monocarboxylate, nucleosides, and dipeptides are expressed in the conjunctiva. Thanks to the rich endowment of these transport processes, drug transport across the conjunctiva into the intraocular tissues may become quite feasible. Subconjunctival injection of microparticles and matrix materials (which allows sustained release of drugs) is shown to maintain reasonable levels of various drugs in the vitreous, perhaps attesting to the fact that conjunctiva per se may contribute as a part of multiple transport barrier(s) in ocular drug delivery. In addition, several conjunctival approaches have been investigated to optimize treatment of dry-eye syndrome and intraocular diseases, and more can be accomplished in the coming years.",M1
15939232,"Transdermal iontophoresis: combination strategies to improve transdermal iontophoretic drug delivery.For several decades, there has been interest in using the skin as a port of entry into the body for the systemic delivery of therapeutic agents. However, the upper layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, poses a barrier to the entry of many therapeutic entities. Given a compound, passive delivery rate is often dependent on two major physicochemical properties: the partition coefficient and solubility. The use of chemical enhancers and modifications of the thermodynamic activity of the applied drug are two frequently employed strategies to improve transdermal permeation. Chemical enhancers are known to enhance drug permeation by several mechanisms which include disrupting the organized intercellular lipid structure of the stratum corneum , 'fluidizing' the stratum corneum lipids , altering cellular proteins, and in some cases, extracting intercellular lipids . However, the resulting increase in drug permeation using these techniques is rather modest especially for hydrophilic drugs. A number of other physical approaches such as iontophoresis, sonophoresis, ultrasound and the use of microneedles are now being studied to improve permeation of hydrophilic as well as lipophilic drugs. This article presents an overview of the use of iontophoresis alone and in conjunction with other approaches such as chemical enhancement, electroporation, sonophoresis, and use of microneedles and <e>ion</e>-exchange materials.",M1
15907603,"The effects of electrically assisted methods on transdermal delivery of nalbuphine benzoate and sebacoyl dinalbuphine ester from solutions and hydrogels.The aim of this study was to assess the effects of iontophoresis and electroporation on transdermal delivery of nalbuphine (NA) and its two novel prodrugs: nalbuphine benzoate (NAB) and sebacoyl dinalbuphine ester (SDN) from solutions as well as from hydrogels. Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were used in hydrogel formulations to evaluate their feasibility for delivery of NA and its prodrugs. Application of iontophoresis or electroporation significantly enhanced the in vitro permeation of NA and its prodrugs. The enhancement effect was more pronounced after applying iontophoresis. The combination of two electrically assisted methods enhanced the delivery of NA; however, no such enhancement was observed for the permeation of NAB and SDN. Hydrogels containing low concentration HPC did not affect the passive as well as electrically assisted permeation of NA and its prodrugs. The increase of hydrogel concentration as well as molecular weight significantly decreased the electrically assisted permeation of NA, whereas the permeation of NAB and SDN remained unchanged. For the electrically assisted permeation from CMC-based hydrogels, the reduced permeation from higher percentage of CMC hydrogels may be attributed the viscosity effect as well as the <e>ion</e> competition effect. The above results demonstrated that lipophilicity and molecular size, as well as hydrogel compositions had significant effects on skin permeation of NA, NAB and SDN via passive diffusion or under the electric field.",M1
15879004,"Effects of beta-phenylethylamine on dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area in the rat: a combined electrophysiological and microdialysis study.The effects of systemic administration of beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA) and microiontophoretically applied beta-PEA on the spontaneous discharge of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the anesthetized rat were examined. Intravenous administration of beta-PEA (1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg) and microiontophoretic applications of beta-PEA caused inhibitory responses in DA neurons. Systemic administration and microiontophoretic applications of beta-PEA induced dose- or current-dependent responses. The systemic beta-PEA-induced inhibitory responses were reversed by pretreatment with the DA D(2) receptor antagonists haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) and sulpiride (10 mg/kg i.p). Pretreatment with reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p. 24 h earlier) did not completely block the systemic administration of beta-PEA (2.5 mg/kg) inhibition. A microdialysis study of freely moving rats demonstrated that the extracellular DA level increased significantly in response to local application of beta-PEA (100 muM) in the VTA via a microdialysis probe, and local application of beta-PEA-stimulated somatodendritic DA release in the VTA. The beta-PEA-induced release of DA was calcium <e>ion</e>-independent and was enhanced by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. These findings indicate that beta-phenylethylamine inhibits DA neuron activity via DA D(2) autoreceptors in the rat VTA and that this inhibitory effect is mediated by the somatodendritic DA release.",M1

15763622,"Transdermal iontophoresis of the dopamine agonist 5-OH-DPAT in human skin in vitro.The feasibility of transdermal iontophoretic delivery of a potent dopamine agonist 5-OH-DPAT was studied in vitro in side by side diffusion cells across human stratum corneum (HSC) and dermatomed human skin (DHS) according to the following protocol: 6 h of passive diffusion, 9 h of iontophoresis and 5 h of passive diffusion. The influences of the following parameters on the flux were studied: donor solution pH, NaCl concentration, drug donor concentration, current density and skin type. A current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2) was used, except for one series of experiments to study the current density effect. Probably due to the influence of the skin perm-selectivity and the competition with H(+), increase in pH from 3 to 5 resulted in a significant increase in flux. Further increase in pH to 6 did not further increase the flux. The iontophoretic transport was found to increase linearly with concentration and current density, providing a convenient way to manage dose titration for Parkinson's disease therapy. Increase in concentration of NaCl dramatically reduced the flux of 5-OH-DPAT as a result of <e>ion</e> competition to the transport. When DHS was used, the iontophoretic transport was less. Also, with DHS the response in flux profile, by switching the current on and off, was shallower than that with HSC. With the optimum condition, a delivery of 104 microg of 5-OH-DPAT per cm(2) patch per hour is feasible, indicating that the therapeutic level could be achieved with a smaller patch size than required in case of rotigotine. Thus, based on this in vitro study, transdermal iontophoretic delivery of 5-OH-DPAT is very promising.",M1
15736190,"Influence of asymmetric donor-receiver <e>ion</e> concentration upon transscleral iontophoretic transport.Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested transscleral iontophoresis as a means for non-invasive drug delivery to the eye. However, there remains a lack of information of the iontophoretic transport behavior of the sclera. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of permeant concentration upon transscleral iontophoretic transport. Constant current direct current (DC) iontophoresis was conducted with rabbit sclera in vitro at permeant concentration ranging from 0.015 to 1.0 M in the donor chamber without background electrolyte at 0.4-4 mA (current density: 2-20 mA/cm2). PBS (0.15 M) was the receiver solution. Salicylate (SA) and tetraethylammonium (TEA) were the model ionic permeants, and mannitol was the neutral probe permeant. Conductivity experiments of SA and TEA solutions were performed to determine the effects of ion concentration upon SA and TEA electromobilities. Model simulations were carried out and compared with the experimental data. It was found that the fluxes of the ionic permeants increased linearly with the electric current but were relatively independent of their donor concentrations. Electric field-induced convective solvent flow (electroosmosis) in the sclera was observed to be from the anode to cathode, suggesting that the sclera is net negatively charge at neutral pH. For the studied permeants, electrophoresis was the main transport enhancing mechanism with electroosmosis as a secondary effect. No significant interaction between the permeants and sclera was observed that significantly altered electroosmosis in the membrane. Under the asymmetric donor and receiver conditions, the transference of the permeants could not be predicted by the concentrations of the ions in the donor and receiver chambers with the assumption of constant electric field in the membrane. The membrane ion concentrations were different from those in the chambers due to the requirement of charge neutrality in the membrane.",M1
15725558,"Effect of lactic acid and iontophoresis on drug permeation across rabbit ear skin.The aim of this paper was to explore the efficacy of lactic acid as permeation enhancer for drug molecules across the skin. Three model permeants were chosen: acetaminophen (non-ionized), buspirone hydrochloride (cationic drug) and ibuprofen lysine (anionic drug). We also explored the association of lactic acid and iontophoresis as a means of enhancing drug delivery. Permeation experiments were performed in vitro, using rabbit ear skin as barrier. The results obtained indicate that lactic acid has some effects on model drug permeation across the skin. The effect was more evident with the anionic drug ibuprofen. Cathodal intophoresis increased ibuprofen transport, but when lactic acid was associated with cathodal iontophoresis, a concentration-dependent reduction of ibuprofen iontophoretic flux was observed, probably for the competition by the co-<e>ion</e>. The application of electric current (anodal iontophoresis) to a solution of acetaminophen produced an increase in its transport, due to the presence of an electroosmotic contribution; however, the effect of the association of anodal iontophoresis and lactic acid produced no further enhancement.",M1
15637683,"Effects of electrophoresis and electroosmosis during alternating current iontophoresis across human epidermal membrane.Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that skin electrical resistance can be controlled by an alternating current (AC) electric field. By maintaining constant skin resistance, AC iontophoresis has been shown to reduce the iontophoretic flux variability of neutral permeants. Recently, it was found that symmetric square-wave AC could enhance iontophoretic transport of both neutral and ionic permeants by means of electrophoresis and/or electroosmosis in a synthetic membrane system, and a model was presented to describe the experimental results. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of AC voltage and frequency and direct current (DC) offset on the flux of neutral and ionic model permeants with human epidermal membrane (HEM). Experiments were conducted under two different conditions: constant AC voltage iontophoresis and iontophoresis using constant HEM resistance with DC offset voltage. The following are the main findings in these experiments. In the constant AC voltage study, when the permeability data were compared at the same HEM electrical resistance, it was demonstrated that AC even at high frequency (approximately 1 kHz) could enhance the transport of the ionic permeant (tetraethylammonium <e>ion</e>) across HEM, but no enhancement was observed for the neutral permeant (arabinose). For the ionic permeant flux enhancement, the higher the applied AC voltage, the greater the flux enhancement. There was little or no AC frequency dependence of the flux enhancement in the frequency range of 50-1000 Hz. In the constant HEM resistance study of AC with DC offset, approximately linear relationships were observed between flux enhancement and the DC offset voltage for both the neutral and ionic permeants, and these results were found to be consistent with predictions of the modified Nernst-Planck model for conventional constant voltage DC iontophoresis. When the DC offset voltage was increased, the AC component of the flux enhancement for the ionic permeant decreased, eventually appearing to contribute negligibly to the total flux enhancement at high DC offset voltages.",M1
15574747,"Acid-induced pain and its modulation in humans.Despite the discovery of <e>ion</e> channels that are activated by protons, we still know relatively little about the signaling of acid pain. We used a novel technique, iontophoresis of protons, to investigate acid-induced pain in human volunteers. We found that transdermal iontophoresis of protons consistently caused moderate pain that was dose-dependent. A marked desensitization occurred with persistent stimulation, with a time constant of approximately 3 min. Recovery from desensitization occurred slowly, over many hours. Acid-induced pain was significantly augmented in skin sensitized by acute topical application of capsaicin. However, skin desensitized by repeated capsaicin application showed no significant reduction in acid-induced pain, suggesting that both capsaicin-sensitive and insensitive sensory neurons contribute to acid pain. Furthermore, topical application of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) significantly attenuated acid-evoked pain but did not affect the heat pain threshold, suggesting a specific interaction between NSAIDs and peripheral acid sensors. Subcutaneous injection of amiloride (1 mm) also significantly inhibited the pain induced by iontophoresis of acid, suggesting an involvement of acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) receptors. Conversely, iontophoresis of acid over a wide range of skin temperatures from 4 to 40 degrees C produced only minor changes in the induced pain. Together these data suggest a prominent role for ASIC channels and only a minor role for transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 as mediators of cutaneous acid-induced pain.",M1
15357421,"Acute endolymphatic hydrops generated by exposure of the ear to nontraumatic low-frequency tones.Low-frequency sounds presented at high nontraumatizing levels induce temporary hyperacusis in humans and animals. One explanation of this finding is that the basilar membrane operating point may be disturbed by an endolymph volume change. This possibility was investigated using volume and flow markers iontophoresed into the endolymphatic space of guinea pigs. Marker concentrations were measured with <e>ion</e>-selective microelectrodes placed apically and basally to the iontophoresis site during exposure of the ear to low-frequency tones. Concentration changes were interpreted quantitatively using a finite-element model of the endolymphatic space that allowed changes of endolymph cross-sectional area and flow to be derived. Stimulation with a 200 Hz tone at 115 dB SPL for 3 min produced marker concentration changes consistent with the induction of transient endolymphatic hydrops and a basally directed displacement of endolymph. Endocochlear potentials were greater than normal after the exposure when hydrops was present. During identical tone exposures of animals without marker, we found that action potential (AP) threshold changes and endolymph potassium changes associated with the hydropic state were small. Marker concentration changes were compared with changes in endocochlear potential and AP thresholds for a range of exposure frequencies and levels. AP hypersensitivity occurred with 200 Hz exposure levels below those inducing endolymph volume disturbances. Endolymph volume changes are thought to be the result of, rather than the cause of, changes in operating point of the cochlear transducer. The observations that auditory threshold and endolymph potassium changes are minimal under conditions where substantial endolymphatic hydrops is present is relevant to our understanding of the hearing loss in patients with Meniere's disease.",M1
15277475,"Delivery of gentamicin to the rabbit eye by drug-loaded hydrogel iontophoresis.PURPOSE: To assess the corneal iontophoretic delivery of gentamicin by drug-loaded hydrogel probe, and to determine the resultant ocular disposition and elimination of the drug from the cornea and anterior chamber. METHODS: Corneal iontophoresis of gentamicin sulfate was studied in healthy white rabbits by using drug-loaded disposable hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) hydrogel disk probes and a portable mini-<e>ion</e> device designed in the authors' laboratory. The iontophoretic treatment was performed with a current intensity of 1 mA for 60 seconds only. Three control groups were used: mock iontophoresis (no current) for 60 seconds, topical eye drops of fortified gentamicin (1.4%) every 5 minutes for 1 hour, and subconjunctival injection of 0.25 mL of 40 mg/mL gentamicin solution. The animals in the iontophoretic experimental groups were killed at predetermined time points. The gentamicin concentrations in the cornea and aqueous humor were assayed with a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Analysis of the gentamicin eye pharmacokinetics was performed with a modeling approach. RESULTS: Peak gentamicin concentrations in the cornea (363.1 +/- 127.3 microg/g) and in the aqueous humor (29.4 +/- 17.4 microg/mL) were reached at 0 and 2 hours after the iontophoretic treatment, respectively. The peak gentamicin concentrations after a single iontophoresis treatment were 12 to 15 times higher than those obtained after gentamicin injection or after topical eye drop instillation, and much higher than in mock iontophoresis. The concentration versus time profile of gentamicin in the cornea and the anterior chamber after iontophoresis was appropriately described by applying a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. CONCLUSIONS: A short iontophoretic treatment using gentamicin-loaded hydrogels has potential clinical value in increasing drug penetration to the anterior segments of the eye and maintaining therapeutic drug levels in the cornea for more than 8 hours.",M1
15212880,"<e>Ion</e>-exchange fibers and drugs: a novel device for the screening of iontophoretic systems.The objective of this study was to theoretically model and experimentally measure the extent of drug release from ion-exchange fibers. The release was measured as a function of current density and NaCl concentration using a novel iontophoretic cell. The fibers tested contained weak carboxylate (-COOH) ion-exchange groups. The cationic model drugs tacrine and metoprolol were chosen on the basis of previous research, where tacrine had the lowest release rate and metoprolol the highest release rate. An in-house designed three compartment test cell was developed to test the suitability of drugs for iontophoretic drug delivery. In this cell, the anode and the drug containing ion-exchange fiber compartments were separated with a Nafion ion-selective membrane, while the fiber and the return electrode compartments were separated with a porous membrane. Tacrine proved to be a good drug candidate for this system as the release of the tacrine from the device was controllable with salt concentration and current density. Metoprolol release from the device was, however, not controllable.",M1
15192031,"Lithium monitoring by reverse iontophoresis in vivo.BACKGROUND: We investigated reverse transdermal iontophoresis as an alternative, noninvasive method for lithium monitoring in vivo. The objectives of such an approach would be to facilitate compliance with treatment and to improve the quality of life for bipolar patients. METHODS: We studied 23 bipolar or schizo-affective patients. Over a 2-h period, we extracted lithium and other cations across intact skin by application of an electric current (0.8 mA) and quantified the concentrations by <e>ion</e> chromatography. A blood sample provided comparative reference values for the drug and other electrolytes. RESULTS: Lithium, sodium, potassium, and calcium were efficiently extracted by iontophoresis. Lithium extraction fluxes were proportional to the corresponding serum concentrations, whereas sodium, potassium, and calcium extraction fluxes were relatively constant, consistent with their stable concentrations in blood. Normalization of the lithium extraction flux with that of sodium, which acted as an  internal standard , permitted calibration of the monitoring procedure without the need for a blood measurement. This conclusion was tested retrospectively by dividing the patients into two groups. The reverse iontophoretic extraction data from the first subset (a) established the proportionality between lithium iontophoresis (or the relative electrotransport of lithium and sodium) and (b) predicted lithium blood concentrations in the second subset of patients. The predictive ability was very good, with the internal standard concept providing substantial benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Reverse iontophoresis appears to offer a novel and accurate method for lithium monitoring.",M1
15186923,"Use of magnetic resonance to measure molecular diffusion within the brain extracellular space.<e>Ion</e>-selective microelectrode measurements of molecular diffusion have provided unique information about the structural characteristics of the extracellular compartment of brain tissue. Magnetic resonance (MR) techniques can also be used to perform diffusion measurements in living tissue in situ. In MR applications, the challenge to study a particular physiological compartment lies in achieving the appropriate specificity in the experimentally-observed MR signal, and many strategies have been used to provide measurements that reflect molecular diffusion within the extracellular space. This review describes how magnetic resonance and microelectrode diffusion measurements are performed, and applications using the MR technique are summarized. Comparisons of experimental results obtained from the two techniques indicate that their use in combination may further augment what is known about extracellular space structure.",M1
15155544,"Noninvasive glucose monitoring by reverse iontophoresis in vivo: application of the internal standard concept.BACKGROUND: The GlucoWatch Biographer uses reverse iontophoresis to extract glucose across the skin to monitor glycemia in diabetes. The invasive daily calibration with a conventional  fingerstick  has been perceived as a disadvantage. We used an  internal standard  to render the approach completely noninvasive. METHODS: The simultaneous extraction of glucose and sodium by reverse iontophoresis was performed on human volunteers over 5 h, and blood glucose was measured in the conventional manner at each collection interval. These data were used for each volunteer to calculate an extraction constant (K), which equals the ratio of the extracted fluxes (JGlucose/JNa+) normalized by the corresponding ratio of the concentrations in the blood ([Glucose]/[Na+]). The values of K were compared between and within volunteers. RESULTS: The iontophoretically extracted glucose flux reflected the glucose concentration profiles in the blood, and sodium extraction remained essentially constant, consistent with the fact that its systemic concentration does not vary significantly. A constant value of K was established for two thirds of the study population. However, the efficiency of glucose extraction varied seasonally, whereas the reverse iontophoresis of Na+ did not; i.e., variation in K became apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the sodium <e>ion</e> as an internal standard could refine the determination of glycemia by reverse iontophoresis without requiring calibration with a blood sample.",M1
15127625,"Effect of receptor solution specific conductivity on iontophoresis of tetracaine hydrochloride.AIM: To examine the quantitative relationship between solution specific conductivity and the permeability of tetracaine HCl, and to investigate the effect of receptor solution specific conductivity on the iontophoretic transport. METHODS: An in vitro study was carried out to determine the iontophoretic permeability of tetracaine hydrochloride through rat skin. Iontophoretic flux of tetracaine hydrochloride through excised rat skin was determined using Valia-Chien two-chamber diffusion cells with a constant d.c. current and Ag/AgCl electrodes. The specific conductivities of donor and receptor solution were also measured. RESULTS: Iontophoretic flux of tetracaine hydrochloride increased with a decrease of anion (chloride <e>ion</e>) concentration in receptor. And the iontophoretic permeability (ER, ER is the enhancement ratio, and ER = iontophoretic flux/passive flux) for tetracaine hydrochloride was directly related to the conductivity of receptor solution when other conditions were held constant. Linear regressions confirmed that ER was related to inverse of overall specific conductivity of donor and receptor solution [1/(ks.d + ks.r), ks.d and ks.r are the specific conductivity of donor and receptor solution]. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that specific conductivity of receptor solution may be a important factor for the iontophoretic permeability of a solute.",M1
15063038,"Transdermal iontophoresis of rotigotine: influence of concentration, temperature and current density in human skin in vitro.Iontophoretic transport of rotigotine across human stratum corneum (HSC) was studied in vitro in side by side diffusion cells according to the following protocol: 6 h of passive diffusion, 9 h of iontophoresis followed by 5 h of passive diffusion. A current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2) was applied. The parameters studied were the influence of the rotigotine concentration in donor phase and the influence of the molecular weight of the co-ions. To this end, Na(+) was replaced by tetra ethyl ammonium (TEA(+)) or tetra butyl ammonium (TBA(+)) (both at pH 5 and 6). In addition, the influence of the acceptor phase temperature (32 degrees C versus room temperature), the replacement of HSC by dermatomed human skin (DHS), and the relation between drug transport and current density were examined. The estimated steady-state flux (Flux(ss)) gradually increased with the drug concentration in the donor phase in a linear manner. The flux was also linearly correlated with the applied current density providing a convenient approach to individual dose titration. The use of TEA(+) as co-<e>ion</e> increased the rotigotine iontophoretic flux significantly, while TBA(+) did not. Replacing HSC by DHS reduced the iontophoretic rotigotine transport, while an increase in temperature to 32 degrees C increased the rotigotine flux. The maximum Flux(ss) achieved was around 80 nmol cm(-2) h(-1) indicating that by means of iontophoresis, a therapeutic level of rotigotine might be achieved with a reasonable patch size.",M1
15037591,"Magnetic resonance imaging study of current and <e>ion</e> delivery into the eye during transscleral and transcorneal iontophoresis.PURPOSE: The objectives were to determine by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the target sites of ion delivery in the eye during iontophoresis, compare transscleral and transcorneal ocular iontophoresis, and monitor the distribution of a probe ion in the anterior chamber and vitreous after iontophoretic delivery. METHODS: Thirty-minute 2-mA anodal constant current transscleral and transcorneal iontophoresis (current density, 10 mA/cm(2)) was performed on three New Zealand White rabbits in vivo. Intravitreal injection and passive delivery were the controls. Transscleral and transcorneal iontophoresis experiments were conducted with the electrode device placed in the superior cul-de-sac away from the limbus and on the cornea adjacent to the limbus, respectively. During iontophoresis, the current delivered into the eye was monitored using a probe ion (Mn(2+)) with MRI. The distributions of the ion in the aqueous and vitreous humor after iontophoresis, passive delivery, and intravitreal injection were also determined by MRI. RESULTS: With the short application time, passive diffusion did not deliver a significant amount of the ion into the eye. Whereas transscleral iontophoresis delivered the ion into the vitreous, transcorneal iontophoresis delivered the ion into the anterior chamber. The current pathways during iontophoresis were mainly from the electrode into the eye, perpendicular to the electrode-eye interface beneath the electrode. Electric current along the surface of the globe was relatively minimal. With the present transscleral iontophoresis protocol, the ion penetrated the sclera and traveled as far as 1.5 mm from the electrode-conjunctiva interface into the vitreous. For transcorneal iontophoresis, the ion penetrated the cornea and filled the entire anterior chamber. CONCLUSIONS: MRI can be a useful technique in the study of the penetration of probe compounds in the eye during and after iontophoresis, such as in iontophoresis protocol and device testing. Ocular pharmacokinetic studies using MRI are noninvasive and provide real-time data without perturbation and compound redistribution that can occur during dissection and assay in traditional pharmacokinetic studies. With MRI, it was shown that transscleral iontophoresis, transcorneal iontophoresis, and intravitreal injection deliver ions to different parts of the eye.",M1
15010125,"Mechanistic studies of flux variability of neutral and ionic permeants during constant current dc iontophoresis with human epidermal membrane.Although constant current iontophoresis is supposed to provide constant transdermal transport, significant flux variability and/or time-dependent flux drifts are observed during iontophoresis with human skin in vitro and human studies in vivo. The objectives of the present study were to determine (a) the causes of flux variability in constant current dc transdermal iontophoresis and (b) the relationships of flux variabilities among permeants of different physicochemical properties. Changes in the human epidermal membrane (HEM) effective pore size and/or electroosmosis during constant current dc iontophoresis were examined. Tetraethylammonium <e>ion</e> (TEA), urea, and mannitol were the model permeants. For the neutral permeants, the results in the present study showed a significant increase of fluxes with time in a given experiment and large HEM sample-to-sample variability. Although both effective pore size and pore charge density variations contributed to the time-dependent flux drifts observed in electroosmotic transport, the significant flux drifts observed were found to be primarily a result of the time-dependent increase in effective pore charge density. For the ionic permeant, the observed flux variability was smaller than that of the neutral permeants and was believed to be primarily due to effective pore size alteration in HEM during iontophoresis as suggested in a previous study. The different extents of flux variability observed between neutral and ionic permeants are consistent with the different iontophoretically enhanced transport mechanisms for the neutral and ionic permeants (i.e. electroosmosis and electrophoresis, respectively). The results of the present study also demonstrate that flux variability of two neutral permeants are inter-related, so the flux of one neutral permeant can be predicted if the permeability coefficient of the other neutral permeant is known.",M1
14753407,"Significant shrinkage of extracellular space during global cerebral ischemia: differences in gray and white matter ischemia.Brain extracellular space (ECS) provides an important microenvironment for neurons and glial cells. In the present study, we investigated differences in ischemic changes of ECS in gray and white matter during global ischemia in cats (n = 8). Diffusion capacity of tetramethylammonium <e>ion</e> (TMA+, 74.1Da) was evaluated by measuring extracellular TMA+ concentration applied via microdialysis. In both gray and white matter, TMA+ concentration significantly increased within 10 minutes after the induction of ischemia, and sustained during 120 min of ischemia. The increase, however, was slower and smaller in white matter than in gray matter. In other two animals, volume fraction and tortuosity of ECS were determined by iontophoresis during global ischemia. After 30 min of ischemia induction, volume fraction was decreased and tortuosity was increased in both gray and white matter. In white matter, decrease in volume fraction and increase in tortuosity were smaller than in gray matter. The present study demonstrates that cerebral ischemia induces not only significant shrinkage of ECS volume but also restricts molecular diffusion within. Smaller changes of diffusion capacity within white matter ECS during ischemia may be relevant for lower ischemic vulnerability of the region.",M1
12798670,"Physicochemical considerations in the iontophoretic delivery of a small peptide: in vitro studies using arginine vasopressin as a model peptide.Transdermal iontophoresis (TI) is a physical enhancement technique to facilitate the delivery of primarily charged molecules across the skin. TI of peptides is influenced by a complex interplay of several factors and one of the main issues in optimizing iontophoretic delivery of peptides is to improve the transport efficiency. From this perspective, this study investigates the effect of the physicochemical parameters on the TI of a peptide arginine vasopressin (AVP). The permeation of AVP showed a linear dependence on the concentration of drug in the donor medium. The iontophoretic flux of AVP was strongly influenced by the pH of the donor solution. Increasing the pH from 5.16 to 7.4 resulted in a decrease in the enhancement ratio by 4.5 times. When the ionic strength was increased by varying the amount of NaCl from 0.05 to 0.25 M the flux was found to decrease by 3.2 times. Replacing normal saline in the receptor compartment by HEPES buffer showed a resultant four times increase in drug permeation. The physiochemical parameters of the donor medium play a significant role in the efficiency of drug delivery by iontophoresis for a small peptide like AVP. Though electrorepulsion would be expected to be the main mechanism involved in the movement of charged molecules across the skin by iontophoresis, for peptides in the molecular weight range of AVP, other associated secondary effects like osmosis, electroosmosis and counter <e>ion</e> flow may also play a significant role in transport across the skin.",M1
12711160,"Iontophoretic and chemical enhancement of drug delivery. Part I: across artificial membranes.This paper reports on measurements of the release characteristics of the model drug salbutamol base from a liquid crystalline vehicle across a non-rate limiting synthetic membrane. The measured passive release rates were compared with analogous behaviour: (i) when a penetration enhancer such as oleic acid was incorporated into the vehicle; (ii) when the release was iontophoretically assisted; and (iii) when the penetration enhancer and iontophoretic assistance were used simultaneously. The effects of using isotonic phosphate buffer solution as the aqueous domain of the vehicle and in the receptor were also separately assessed. The passive release from the standard system was consistent with matrix diffusion control. The addition of oleic acid indicated association of the drug with the fatty acid so that its release into an aqueous medium was significantly retarded. With buffer <e>ions</e> present in the vehicle the release rate increased consistent with reduced association, and when phosphate buffer was used as a receptor medium the release rate exceeded that of the standard vehicle due to an ion exchange process. The delivery of salbutamol from the fatty acid containing systems was substantially enhanced by iontophoresis and the rates were shown to be approximately proportional to the assisting currents. The data clearly indicate the iontophoretic process to be significantly less efficient in the presence of buffer ions but with the iontophoretic delivery rates being enhanced by the presence of a fatty acid.",M1
12623203,"Transdermal iontophoresis of insulin. II. Physicochemical considerations.Transdermal iontophoresis is one of the potential enhancement strategies for the delivery of large and charged molecules. Insulin, a polypeptide of 6 kDa was used as a model for large peptides to understand the influence of peptide concentration, NaCl concentration, buffer type and its concentration on the transport efficiency of iontophoresis. Maximum enhancement was found at 3 mg/ml (75 IU/ml). The permeation of insulin was found to increase up to 0.05 M NaCl and decreased at higher concentrations of NaCl. The glucose permeation studies showed that permeation of insulin increased in the presence of NaCl due to <e>ion</e> induced convective flow. The flux enhancement of insulin in the presence of phthalate buffer was higher in comparison to citrate buffer, but the enhancement in these two buffers was the same in the presence of 0.05 M NaCl, which was also supported by a similar trend in conductivity values. However, the solution conductivity values did not reflect the influence of co-ions and counter ions on the transport of large peptides across the skin. Overall the findings revealed that the transport efficiency of large peptides like insulin may be improved by the optimisation of competing ions in solution.",M1
12535769,"Measurement of diffusion parameters using a sinusoidal iontophoretic source in rat cortex.A new method was developed to extract diffusion parameters in brain tissue using a sinusoidal iontophoretic point source of tetramethylammonium operated at different frequencies. The resulting steady state oscillating extracellular concentration of this probe molecule was continuously monitored using an <e>ion</e>-selective microelectrode located about 100 microm from the source. Because the probe molecules must diffuse through the extracellular space (ECS), the oscillating concentration at the recording location will develop a phase lag and an amplitude attenuation relative to the sinusoidal source. These two components of the signal can be analyzed to determine the tortuosity factor lambda and the ECS volume fraction alpha. The method also measures the nonspecific clearance rate constant kappa. In brain slices this reflects washout of diffusing molecules. Values of alpha (0.18+/-0.05) and lambda (1.67+/-0.08) obtained from this frequency method in rat cortical slices were similar to those obtained by the real-time iontophoretic method employing a square pulse source. The relative merits of the frequency method compared to the pulse method are discussed.",M1
12208457,"Improved stability and release control of levodopa and metaraminol using <e>ion</e>-exchange fibers and transdermal iontophoresis.Achievement of controlled drug delivery and stability of drugs during storage is a problem also in transdermal drug delivery. The objective of this study was to determine, whether an easily oxidized drug, levodopa, could be stabilized during storage using pH-adjustment and ion-exchange fibers. Controlled transdermal delivery of the zwitterionic levodopa was attempted by iontophoresis and ion-exchange fiber. Ion-exchange kinetics and transdermal permeation of a cationic (presumably more stable) model drug, metaraminol, were compared to the corresponding data of levodopa. Levodopa was rapidly oxidized in the presence of water, especially at basic pH-values. At acidic pH-values the stability was improved significantly. Ion-exchange group and the pH had a clear effect on the release of both the levodopa and metaraminol from the ion-exchange fiber. The adsorption/release kinetics of metaraminol were more easily controllable than the corresponding rate and extent of levodopa adsorption/release. Iontophoretic enhancement of drug permeation across the skin was clearly more significant with the positively charged metaraminol than with the zwitterionic levodopa. Ion-exchange fibers provide a promising alternative to control drug delivery and to store drugs that are degraded easily.",M1
12135333,"Ca-dependent regulation of the Na-K-pump by post-tetanic sensitization of extrasynaptic cholinoreceptors in common snail neurons.Studies were conducted on the role of the Na,K pump and intracellular calcium in the previously observed phenomenon of increased cholinosensitivity of the somatic membranes of neurons LPa3 and RPa3 in the common snail, induced by electrical tetanic stimulation (10.5 mA. 0.1 sec, 2 impulses/sec; 2 min) of the afferent input (the intestinal nerve). Recordings were made of integral transmembrane acetylcholine-evoked currents by two-electrode membrane voltage clamping. After intracellular administration of the Na,K pump inhibitor ouabain (70 microM), there was no post-tetanic increase in neuron cholinosensitivity. Intracellular injection of the calcium <e>ion</e> chelator BAPTA suppressed the sensitization of somatic cholinoreceptors after orthodromal tetanization.

12034936,"Transtympanic iontophoresis with a biocompatible paramagnetic solution at MR imaging: experimental feasibility study in rabbits.PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of transtympanic iontophoresis in experimental animals with a paramagnetic contrast agent at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Optimal MR sequence parameters and appropriate paramagnetic <e>ion</e> concentrations of a water and gadopentetate dimeglumine solution were initially assessed with phantoms. Iontophoresis was performed in left ears of five rabbits after the external auditory canals were filled with a solution of water and gadopentetate dimeglumine of optimal concentration, and right ears were used as controls. Signal-to-structural noise ratio (SSNR) and contrast-to-structural noise ratio (CSNR) were measured by using regions of interest, and the overall image quality was assessed subjectively. RESULTS: Spin-echo (SE) MR sequences were superior to gradient-echo (GRE) MR sequences in terms of SSNR, CSNR, and overall image quality. Highest SSNR and CSNR values were achieved with 2 mmol/L (2 mM) of gadopentetate dimeglumine solution with both SE (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 500/12; flip angle, 90 degrees ) and GRE (300/10; flip angle, 90 degrees ) sequences in both phantoms and animals. The high signal intensity of gadopentetate dimeglumine solution was recognized in middle ears, vestibules, and semicircular canals of all rabbit ears that had undergone iontophoresis and in none of the control ears. CONCLUSION: With the solution of water and gadopentetate dimeglumine, the maximum SSNR and CSNR with both SE and GRE MR imaging sequences were achieved. The solution can be transferred to the middle and inner ear cavities across an intact tympanic membrane by using transtympanic iontophoresis.",M1

METHODS: A series of in vitro transdermal iontophoretic experiments were instituted to study the effects of drug concentration, co-<e>ion</e> concentration, intensity of current, and application time on ropinirole flux. The convective contribution to ropinirole electrotransport was evaluated by following the transport of the electroosmotic marker mannitol. RESULTS: Ropinirole flux decreased dramatically in the presence of competing ions. This effect was observed even when the molar fraction of the two competing cations was kept constant. Anodal flux of mannitol decreased with drug concentration, indicating a possible alteration of the skin permselectivity. In the absence of competing co-ions, ropinirole transport number reached a maximum value (8-13%). In these conditions, the main factor controlling drug delivery was the intensity of current applied. CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal iontophoresis allowed the delivery of therapeutic doses of ropinirole. The dose administered and the input rate were controlled by the judicious choice of the key delivery factors here described.",M1
11777748,"Post-iontophoresis recovery of human skin impedance in vivo.The objective of this study was to better understand the recovery of human skin impedance following iontophoresis in vivo. Volunteers were subjected to a 15-min period of iontophoresis in the presence of aqueous solutions of either NaCl, KCl, CaCl(2) or MgCl(2) at 133 mM. Subsequently, the low-frequency impedance (at 1 Hz) recovery was followed for a further 30 min. Assuming direct proportionality between the reciprocal impedance and the <e>ion</e> concentration in the membrane, the experimental data were fitted to the appropriate solutions of Fick's second law of diffusion to derive characteristic diffusion parameters (D/L(2)), apparent diffusivities (D), diffusion pathlengths (L) and mobilities, and ion concentrations in the skin immediately post-iontophoresis. Ion fluxes out of the membrane after termination of current flow were also deduced. In general, recovery was relatively independent of the background electrolyte as previously reported, and the data were consistent with ion transport in predominantly aqueous pathways. Compared to its mobility in aqueous solution, however, the apparent Cl- mobility in the skin was smaller, presumably due to the fact that, under normal physiological conditions, the human skin barrier supports a net negative charge. In parallel, the initial  release  of Na+ and K+ from the skin post-iontophoresis was faster than that of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+), the latter cations of higher charge density being able to associate more strongly, it seems, with the negatively-charged skin. The simple physicochemical analysis of the data presented serves to emphasize that a decrease in skin impedance is not a manifestation of damage to the barrier--rather, it is a natural response to the relevant electrical potential and ion concentration gradients involved.",M1
11741239,"Recovery of human skin impedance in vivo after iontophoresis: effect of metal ions.The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the counter-<e>ion</e> (cation) on the recovery of human skin impedance after iontophoresis in vivo. A series of metal chloride aqueous solutions (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) was investigated: first at the same concentration (133 mmol/L) and then at the same ionic strength as a NaCl solution at 133 mmol/L. The influence of hydration alone was also examined as a control. The recovery of human skin impedance was followed in the frequency range 1-1,000 Hz, over a 30-minute period after iontophoresis during which 3 impedance spectra were recorded. The results revealed that at t = 30 minutes post-iontophoresis, skin impedance was approximately 3 times greater than the value immediately after the cessation of current passage. However, the results showed that the nature of the cation had no effect on recovery, regardless of whether the ions were at the same concentration or at an equivalent ionic strength. A simple parallel RC-equivalent circuit model for skin was used to determine the resistive (R) and capacitive (C) contributions to skin impedance. An analysis of variance on the calculated R and C values did not show any differences between the electrolytes used at the 2 different ionic strengths.",M1
11693479,"The Na,K pump regulates decreases in the cholinosensitivity of neurons in the common snail to a cellular analog of habituation: the role of cellular calcium.The effects of the Na,K pump inhibitor ouabain on the depth of depression of cholinosensitivity of defensive behavior command neurons LPa2, LPa3, RPa3, and RPa2 were studied in the common snail using a cellular analog of habituation; the role of intracellular Ca2+ in these effects was analyzed. Integral acetylcholine-evoked transmembrane currents (ACh currents) were recorded by two-electrode membrane voltage clamping. In one group of neurons, extracellular application of ouabain (0.1 mM) by addition to the bathing solution evoked increases in the depression of the ACh current evoked by rhythmic application of mediator (with interstimulus intervals of 1-3 min) while neurons of the other groups responded with decreases in depression. After spontaneous diffusion of the Ca2+ <e>ion</e> chelator BAPTA (1 mM) from the intracellular microelectrode for 60-150 min, ouabain only increased the level of depression of the ACh current. After intracellular injection of CaCl2 (100 mM), ouabain only decreased the level of depression of the ACh current. It was concluded that inhibition of the Na,K pump modifies depression of the cholinosensitivity of neurons in the cellular model of habituation.

11496938,"X-ray microanalysis of cryopreserved human skin to study the effect of iontophoresis on percutaneous <e>ion</e> transport.PURPOSE: To study at the ultrastructural level which part of the skin is associated with percutaneous iodide transport by passive diffusion and iontophoresis. METHODS: Following passive diffusion or iontophoresis of iodide, the morphology and the ion distribution of the skin was preserved by rapid freezing. The skin was kept frozen until and during examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray microanalysis (XRMA). The intrinsic electron absorbing characteristics of cryopreserved skin allow direct TEM examination without additional staining. XRMA can be used to obtain in a relatively nondestructive way in situ information on ion distributions across the skin. RESULTS: After passive diffusion, iodide was mainly found in the stratum corneum (SC), whereas there was little iodide in the viable epidermis. Iontophoresis up to 300 microA/cm2 did not significantly affect this distribution. With iontophoresis at 1,000 microA/cm2, the amount of iodide increased dramatically and was equally distributed over the SC and viable epidermis. The presence of iodide in the SC suggests that iodide is present inside corneocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Iontophoresis up to 300 microA/cm2 does not significantly perturb skin structures in contrast to iontophoresis at 1,000 microA/cm2. The presence of iodide inside corneocytes suggests the possibility of transcellular percutaneous iodide transport.",M1
11458340,"Quantification of pore induction in human epidermal membrane during iontophoresis: the importance of background electrolyte selection.It has been shown that significant pore induction (electroporation) occurs in human epidermal membrane (HEM) during iontophoresis even at moderate applied voltages (1-10 V). Recent efforts in our laboratory have been aimed at quantifying HEM electroporation by examining the proportionality between flux enhancement due to electroporation and electrical conductance changes during iontophoresis. The specific purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that by matching the background electrolyte <e>ion</e> sizes with the permeant ion sizes, the flux enhancement due to electroporation can be quantified by the change in HEM electrical conductance. In this study, radiolabeled tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)), methylammonium (MA(+)), and mannitol were the permeants. Potassium chloride (KCl), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB), tetraethylammonium pivalate (TEAP), and sodium fluoride (NaF) were the background electrolytes. Iontophoresis experiments were carried out over an applied voltage range of 1 to 3 V. The experimental flux enhancement results were compared with the theoretical predictions from the Nernst-Planck model after corrections were made: (a) for HEM pore induction during iontophoresis based on electrical conductance changes and (b) for electroosmosis employing mannitol as the neutral probe permeant. In experiments where the ion sizes of the background electrolyte and permeant were closely matched (e.g., TEA(+) as the permeant and TEAP as the background electrolyte), there was excellent agreement between experimental results and theoretical predictions of the modified Nernst-Planck model, with only modest data scatter. When the electrolyte and permeant sizes were quite different (e.g., TEA(+)/KCl and MA(+)/TEAP), the experimental flux data were inconsistent with model predictions and there were large variations in the experimental results. The results of the present study illustrate that permeant flux enhancement can be predicted by the modified Nernst-Planck model even during moderate voltage iontophoresis when electroporation is operative.",M1

11337058,"A mechanism of the high frequency AC iontophoresis.The efficiency and the voltage dependence of the AC iontophoresis were studied in vitro. Two cylindrical glass cells separated by a cellophane film were used, where the donor cell was filled with the solution of target electrolytes and the receptor cell with distilled water. The sinusoidal AC voltage with a frequency of 1 kHz was applied between the two platinum plates located at the opposite ends of two cells. The time variation of the <e>ion</e> concentration was evaluated by measuring the impedance of the solution in the receptor cell. The transportation velocity of the ions increased with the amplitude of the voltage applied between two platinum plate electrodes apart 20 mm up to approximately 15 V, and leveled off above approximately 15 V. A theoretical model is proposed on the AC iontophoresis, where each ion moves together with the surrounding water molecules when it is hydrated. The effective Stokes radius of an ion is assumed to be half of the whole size of the ion with hydrating water molecules. When the external alternating electric field strongly vibrates the ion, the ion-dipole interactions between the ion and water molecules are broken, resulting in the reduced effective Stokes radius, which leads to the increase of the diffusion efficiency.",M1
11263572,"Ionophoretic studies on mixed metal--nitrilotriacetate--penicillamine complexes.Paper ionophoresis is described for the study of equilibria in a mixed ligand complex system in solution. This method is based on the movement of a spot of metal <e>ion</e> in an electric field with the complexants added in the background electrolyte at pH 8.5. The concentration of the primary ligand (nitrilotriacetate) was kept constant, while that of the secondary ligand (penicillamine) was varied. The stability constants of the metal-nitrilotriacetate-penicillamine complexes have been found to be 6.26 +/- 0.09 and 6.68 +/- 0.13 (log K values) for Al3+ and Th4+ complexes, respectively, at 35 degrees C and ionic strength 0.1 M.",M1
11259844,"The role of electroosmotic flow in transdermal iontophoresis.Iontophoresis enhances transdermal drug delivery by three mechanisms: (a) the <e>ion</e>-electric field interaction provides an additional force which drives ions through the skin; (b) flow of electric current increases permeability of skin; and (c) electroosmosis produces bulk motion of the solvent itself that carries ions or neutral species, with the solvent 'stream'. The relative importance of electroosmotic flow is the subject of this review. Experimental observations and theoretical concepts are reviewed to clarify the nature of electroosmotic flow and to define the conditions under which electroosmotic flow is an important effect in transdermal iontophoresis. Electroosmotic flow is bulk fluid flow which occurs when a voltage difference is imposed across a charged membrane. Electroosmotic flow occurs in a wide variety of membranes, is always in the same direction as flow of counterions and may either assist or hinder drug transport. Since both human skin and hairless mouse skin are negatively charged above about pH 4, counterions are positive ions and electroosmotic flow occurs from anode to cathode. Thus, anodic delivery is assisted by electroosmosis, but cathodic delivery is retarded. Water carried by ions as 'hydration water' does not contribute significantly to electroosmotic flow. Rather electroosmotic flow is caused by an electrical volume force acting on the mobile counterions. The simple 'limiting law' theory commonly given in textbooks and some research articles is a very poor approximation for transdermal systems. However, several extensions of the limiting law are compatible with each other and with the available experimental data. One of these theories, the Manning theory, has been incorporated into a theory for the effect of electroosmotic flow on iontophoresis, the latter theory being in good agreement with experiment. Both theory and experimental data indicate that electroosmotic flow increases in importance as the size of the drug ion increases. The 'ionic' or Nernst-Planck effect is the largest contributor to flux enhancement for small ions. Increased skin permeability or the skin 'damage effect', is a significant factor for both large and small ions, particularly for experiments at high current density. For monovalent ions with Stokes radii larger than about 1 nm, electroosmotic flow is the dominant flow mechanism. Because of electroosmotic flow, transdermal delivery of a large anion (or negatively charged protein) from the anode compartment can be more effective than delivery from the cathode compartment.",M1
11152750,"Identified serotonergic neurons in the Tritonia swim CPG activate both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors.Although G-protein-coupled (metabotropic) receptors are known to modulate the production of motor patterns, evidence from the escape swim central pattern generator (CPG) of the nudibranch mollusk, Tritonia diomedea, suggests that they might also participate in the generation of the motor pattern itself. The dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs), identified serotonergic neurons intrinsic to the Tritonia swim CPG, evoke dual component synaptic potentials onto other CPG neurons and premotor interneurons. Both the fast and slow components were previously shown to be due to serotonin (5-HT) acting at distinct postsynaptic receptors. We find that blocking or facilitating metabotropic receptors in a postsynaptic premotor interneuron differentially affects the fast and slow synaptic responses to DSI stimulation. Blocking G-protein activation by iontophoretically injecting the GDP-analogue guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP-beta-S) did not significantly affect the DSI-evoked fast excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) but decreased the amplitude of the slow component more than 50%. Injection of the GTP analogues guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S) and 5'-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate, to prolong G-protein activation, had mixed effects on the fast component but increased the amplitude and duration of the slow component of the DSI-evoked response and, with repeated DSI stimulation, led to a persistent depolarization. These results indicate that the fast component of the biphasic synaptic potential evoked by a serotonergic CPG neuron onto premotor interneurons is mediated by ionotropic receptors (5-HT-gated <e>ion</e> channels), whereas the slow component is mediated by G-protein-coupled receptors. A similar synaptic activation of metabotropic receptors might also be found within the CPG itself, where it could exert a direct influence onto motor pattern generation.",M1

The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is usually established in early childhood but it is now being made in an increasing number of adults. Many of them present with mild or atypical cystic fibrosis clinical features, mostly lung disease. In addition, some adults with congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens or idiopathic chronic pancreatitis may be assigned a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adults should be based on the presence of one or more characteristic clinical features, a history of cystic fibrosis in a sibling, plus evidence of defective CFTR function as documented by elevated sweat chloride concentrations or abnormal <e>ion</e> transport across the nasal epithelium, or identification of mutations on both CFTR genes.",M1
10925124,"The electrostability and electrically assisted delivery of an organophosphate pretreatment (physostigmine) across human skin in vitro.Physostigmine is a tertiary carbamate that is utilised as a pretreatment against organophosphate intoxication. Oral delivery of physostigmine is not practical due to high first pass metabolism and short elimination half life. Transdermal administration of physostigmine may circumvent such problems. The aim of this study was to assess the electrostability of physostigmine and the feasibility of electrically assisted transdermal drug delivery of physostigmine through isolated human skin in vitro. Buffered solutions of physostigmine (free base, salicylate and sulphate) were electrostable under conditions of iontophoresis and electroporation as measured by HPLC, although instability of the chloridised silver electrodes was observed. Physostigmine sulphate was chosen for further study as it appeared to prevent degradation of the electrodes. Under conditions of iontophoresis (0.8 mA cm(-2), applied for 5- or 2.5-min durations for a maximum period of 45 min over 8 h), the total quantity of physostigmine sulphate that penetrated was 6.5+/-2.3% and 3.9+/-1.7% (pH 5.0 and pH 5.5) of the total applied dose (2 mg). Physostigmine did not penetrate the skin when electroporated at a frequency of 0.1 Hz or 10 Hz (100 V, 1 ms pulse width, duration 1 s, repetition 5-10 s), but significant amounts were delivered at a frequency of 100 Hz, being 11.3+/-2.9% and 5.8+/-2.5% of the applied dose (pH 5.0 and pH 5.5, respectively). These data indicate that iontophoretic and electroporative drug delivery of physostigmine sulphate was buffer-dependent, an effect tentatively attributed to a combination of co-<e>ion</e> competition, mono/di-cation ratio and applied charge effects.",M1
10867270,"On iontophoretic delivery enhancement: ionization and transport properties of lidocaine hydrochloride in aqueous propylene glycol.The ionization and transport properties of lidocaine hydrochloride (LidHCl) in aqueous propylene glycol (PG) containing 20% PG by weight was studied by means of electrical precision conductometry.

A two variable analysis of the experimental data yielded K(a)=1.5x10(-8) for the acid dissociation constant of LidH(+), i.e. pK(a)=7.82, and the limiting ionic conductivity, lambda(o)(LidH(+))=21.73 cm(2) S mol(-1).

10825552,"Controlled transdermal iontophoresis by <e>ion</e>-exchange fiber.The objective of this study was to assess the transdermal delivery of drugs using iontophoresis with cation- and anion-exchange fibers as controlled drug delivery vehicles. Complexation of charged model drugs with the ion-exchange fibers was studied as a method to achieve controlled transdermal drug delivery. Drug release from the cation-exchange fiber into a physiological saline was dependent on the lipophilicity of the drug. The release rates of lipophilic tacrine and propranolol were significantly slower than that of hydrophilic nadolol. Permeation of tacrine across the skin was directly related to the iontophoretic current density and drug concentration used. Anion-exchange fiber was tested with anionic sodium salicylate. The iontophoretic flux enhancement of sodium salicylate from the fiber was substantial. As the drug has to be released from the ion-exchange fiber before permeating across the skin, a clear reduction in the drug fluxes from the cationic and anionic fibers were observed compared to the respective fluxes of the drugs in solution. Overall, the ion-exchange fibers act as a drug reservoir, controlling the release and iontophoretic transdermal delivery of the drug.",M1
10664140,"Physiological elevations in cytoplasmic free calcium by cold or <e>ion</e> injection result in transient closure of higher plant plasmodesmata.The concentration of cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) required to close higher plant plasmodesmata was investigated using corn (Zea mays L. cv. Black Mexican Sweet) suspension-culture cells. Physiological elevations of [Ca(2+)](cyt) were applied by cold treatment, and ion injection was also used to increase [Ca(2+)](cyt), by diffusion (for small increases) or by iontophoresis (for larger increases). The impact of such treatments on [Ca(2+)](cyt) was measured by ratiometric ion imaging. Intercellular communication during treatments was monitored using our recently developed electrophysiological technique that allows the electrical resistance of plasmodesmata and the plasma membranes of a sister-cell pair to be measured. A 4-fold increase in the calculated resistance of single plasmodesmata was observed in response to cold treatment that caused a 2-fold increase in average [Ca(2+)](cyt) (from 107 to 210 nM). In response to iontophoresis of Ca(2+), plasmodesmata were observed to go from  open  (low resistance) to  shut  (high resistance) and then back  open  within 10 s. Our results thus indicate that higher plant plasmodesmata respond quickly to physiological changes in [Ca(2+)](cyt).",M1
10518630,"Mechanistic aspects of iontophoresis in human epidermal membrane.A large number of factors are involved in the movement of <e>ions</e> and molecules across human epidermal membrane (HEM) under the influence of an electric field. These factors and their interplay need to be understood if our knowledge of iontophoretic transport of drugs across HEM is to reach a point where physical models and strategies may be employed for useful quantitative predictions. In a typical in vitro experiment, the fully hydrated HEM is positioned between aqueous compartments of a two-chamber diffusion cell. When a low electric field is applied across the HEM under these conditions, the transport enhancement of ions in the pre-existing pores of the stratum corneum is the result of, (a) the direct interaction of the electric field with the charge of the ion in question, and (b) convective solvent flow (electroosmosis); in the case where the permeant is non-ionic under these circumstances, transport enhancement is by convective solvent flow only. At moderate-to-high voltage iontophoresis (&gt; or = around 1.0 V applied across a single HEM), in addition to the direct field effect and convective solvent flow in the pre-existing pores, there can generally be a significant (e.g. 10- to 100-fold enhancement) contribution to transport enhancement arising from new pore induction (electroporation). Much of the recent work in our laboratory has been devoted to defining and quantifying HEM electroporation, and an especially difficult aspect has been that of dealing with the large HEM membrane-to-membrane variabilities with regard to, (a) the extent of new pore induction, and (b) the characteristics of the newly induced pores. Recently we discovered that the extent of relevant (i.e. permeant accessible) pore induction may be correlated to the change in HEM electrical conductance (and quantifiable) if an appropriate matching background electrolyte can be selected having ion sizes comparable to that of the permeant. For example, employing tetraethylammonium (TEA) pivalate (PIV) for which the ion sizes are approximately 3.5 A, but not KCl (ion sizes approximately 1.9 A), as the background electrolyte for TEA (as the permeant) gave very good results; in this example, the sizable contribution of pore induction to iontophoresis was quantitatively factored out from the total iontophoretic enhancement. Experiments with a large number of HEM samples gave good agreement with the Nernst-Planck (N-P) predictions of the direct field effect when TEA-PIV was used as the background electrolyte for TEA transport, but large variations (up to 300%) between N-P predictions and experimental results were observed with KCl as the background electrolyte. Another area of recent effort has been HEM pore size determinations, both at low voltages (i.e. for pre-existing pores) and at voltages where the newly induced pores dominate HEM permeability. The sizes of pre-existing pores of HEM have been determined with the hindered diffusion theory (using experimental fluxes of several probe permeants of different known molecular sizes) to be generally in the range, 10-20 A, by a number of investigators in our laboratory for a large number HEM samples. Deducing pore sizes of electric field induced pores under steady electroporation conditions has been a more challenging task. We succeeded recently in developing a novel method for 'passively' determining pore sizes (i.e. by passive diffusion with hindered diffusion theory) under steady electroporation conditions: by using low frequency (12.5 Hz) a.c. at 2-5 V. We have been able to sustain electroporation at a nearly constant state of electroporation long enough to carry out a set of 'passive' diffusion experiments with relatively good precision to obtain the sizes of the newly induced pores. Studies to date have revealed that the sizes of pores induced with 2-5 V are of the same order of magnitude as those of the pre-existing pores (i.e. 10-20 A). Finally, another research question of interest has been that of pore charge",M1
10370166,"Transdermal iontophoretic delivery of enoxacin from various liposome-encapsulated formulations.The major purpose of this work was to study the effect of various liposome formulations on the iontophoretic transport of enoxacin through excised rat skin. The electrochemical stability of these liposomes was also evaluated. The encapsulation percentage of enoxacin was significantly enhanced after 6 h incubation in an electric field; whereas the fusion of liposomes was inhibited by application of electric current. The results of iontophoretic drug transport showed that the permeability of enoxacin released from liposomes was higher compared with that of free drug. The iontophoretic permeability of enoxacin released from liposomes increased with a decrease in the fatty acid chain length of the phospholipid, which may be due to the different phase transition temperatures of the phospholipids. Incorporation of charged phospholipid resulted in an alteration of the transdermal behavior of enoxacin: the iontophoretic permeation as well as the amount of enoxacin partitioned in skin was greatly reduced after incorporation of stearylamine in liposomes, which can be attributed to the competitive <e>ion</e> effect. The enoxacin released from stratum corneum-based liposomes showed the highest amount of enoxacin partitioned into skin depot. The results of employing cathodal iontophoresis on negative charged liposomes suggested that the liposomal vesicles or phospholipids may carry enoxacin into deeper skin strata via the follicular route.",M1
9794501,"Epidermal iontophoresis: II. Application of the ionic mobility-pore model to the transport of local anesthetics.PURPOSE: An in vitro study was carried out to determine the iontophoretic permeability of local anesthetics through human epidermis. The relationship between physicochemical structure and the permeability of these solutes was then examined using an ionic mobility-pore model developed to define quantitative relationships. METHODS: The iontophoretic permeability of both ester-type anesthetics (procaine, butacaine, tetracaine) and amide-type anesthetics (prilocaine, mepivacaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, etidocaine, cinchocaine) were determined through excised human epidermis over 2 hrs using a constant d.c. current and Ag/AgCl electrodes. Individual <e>ion</e> mobilities were determined from conductivity measurements in aqueous solutions. Multiple stepwise regression was applied to interrelate the iontophoretic permeability of the solutes with their physical properties to examine the appropriateness of the ionic mobility-pore model and to determine the best predictor of iontophoretic permeability of the local anesthetics. RESULTS: The logarithm of the iontophoretic permeability coefficient (log PC(j,iont)) for local anesthetics was directly related to the log ionic mobility and MW for the free volume form of the model when other conditions are held constant. Multiple linear regressions confirmed that log PC(j,iont) was best defined by ionic mobility (and its determinants: conductivity, pKa and MW) and MW. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that of the properties studied, the best predictors of iontophoretic transport of local anesthetics are ionic mobility (or pKa) and molecular size. These predictions are consistent with the ionic mobility pore model determined by the mobility of ions in the aqueous solution, the total current, epidermal permselectivity and other factors as defined by the model.",M1
9682877,"The kinetics of tracer movement through homologous gap junctions in the rabbit retina.Observation of the spread of biotinylated or fluorescent tracers following injection into a single cell has become one of the most common methods of demonstrating the presence of gap junctions. Nevertheless, many of the fundamental features of tracer movement through gap junctions are still poorly understood. These include the relative roles of diffusion and iontophoretic current, and under what conditions the size of the stained mosaic will increase, asymptote, or decline. Additionally, the effect of variations in amount of tracer introduced, as produced by variation in electrode resistance following cell penetration, is not obvious. To examine these questions, Neurobiotin was microinjected into the two types of horizontal cell of the rabbit retina and visualized with streptavidin-Cy3. Images were digitally captured using a confocal microscope. The spatial distribution of Neurobiotin across the patches of coupled cells was measured. Adequate fits to the data were obtained by fitting to a model with terms for diffusion and amount of tracer injected. Results indicated that passive diffusion is the major source of tracer movement through gap junctions, whereas iontophoretic current played no role over the range tested. Fluorescent visualization, although slightly less sensitive than peroxidase reactions, produced staining intensities with a more useful dynamic range. The rate constants for movement of Neurobiotin between A-type horizontal cells was about ten times greater than that for B-type horizontal cells. Although direct extrapolation to <e>ion</e> conductances cannot be assumed, tracer movement can be used to give an estimate of relative coupling rates across cell types, retinal location, or modulation conditions in intact tissue.",M1

It was compared with salbutamol sulphate and salbutamol:sulphate ion-pair. It was found that there exists an optimum duty cycle range (1:3-1:4) at which iontophoretic flux of the ion-pair was at a maximum because of partition-electric current synchronization. Addition of mannitol decreases the flux of the ion-pair showing the important role of electroosmosis in ion-pair transport. The extremes of pH decrease the flux rates.",M1
9165344,"Longitudinal endolymph flow associated with acute volume increase in the guinea pig cochlea.Endolymph volume disturbances were induced by microinjections of artificial endolymph into the second turn of the guinea pig cochlea at rates less than 60 nl/min. Induced longitudinal movements and area changes of endolymph were quantified in the basal turn using an ionic flow marker technique. Tetramethylammonium (TMA) was used as a flow marker by iontophoresing it into endolymph in micromolar amounts. TMA movements in the apical and basal directions were monitored by <e>ion</e>-selective electrodes. Changes in endolymph flow and cross-sectional area of scala media were derived using a mathematical model to interpret the recorded tracer time courses. The model was validated by performing comparable volume injections and flow measurements in fine-diameter plastic tubes. The rate of flow of endolymph measured prior to injection was close to zero, in agreement with prior studies. Based on the injection of different volumes into endolymph over a 15 min period, we found that injection of up to 80 nl of artificial endolymph into the second turn would not induce flow in the basal turn. However, above this amount, flow towards the base increased at a rate which correlated with the injected volume, with endolymph moving basally by a distance of 0.0067 mm/nl of artificial endolymph injected. Flow rates measured in the third turn, on the apical side of the injection were far lower and showed characteristics consistent with there being no outlet at the apex. These results suggest that small volume disturbances are corrected locally in the cochlea, but larger disturbances produce a longitudinal flow of endolymph out of the cochlea which represents a significant mechanism contributing to homeostasis. It can be concluded that structures outside the cochlea, such as the endolymphatic sac, do play a role in the correction of endolymph volume disturbances. Although the maintenance of endolymph composition is dominated by local ion transport mechanisms, the capacity of these local mechanisms to maintain normal endolymph volume appears to be limited.",M1
8865306,"The influence of an electric field on <e>ion</e> and water accessibility to stratum corneum lipid lamellae.PURPOSE: To study ion transport through stratum corneum (SC) lipid lamellae under passive and iontophoretic conditions. METHODS: Iodide ion transport was measured by fluorescence quenching. Since the process involves diffusion of an iodide ion to the fluorophore located within the SC lamellae, the accessibility of iodide ions was measured. Moreover, the use of anthroyloxy fatty acid probes, provided information as a function of depth within the lamellae. RESULTS: Fluorescence quenching by iodide ions increased with iontophoretic current density, suggesting increased ion accessibility within the SC lamellae. In addition, at constant current, quenching decreased as the fluorophore was located deeper within the lamellae. This gradient in ion accessibility suggests that more iodide is found near the head-group than near the core of the SC lipid lamellae. Results obtained in the absence of iodide also show increased water accessibility during iontophoresis. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that in the presence of an applied electric field the SC lipid lamellae interior becomes more accessible to water and ions. These results imply that during iontophoresis, ion and water transport through human skin is associated, at least in part, with the SC lipid lamellae.",M1
8804622,"Simultaneous measurements of intracellular pH in the leech giant glial cell using 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein and <e>ion</e>-sensitive microelectrodes.We have employed two independent techniques to measure the intracellular pH (pHi) in giant glial cells of the leech Hirudo medicinalis, using the fluorescent dye 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and double-barreled neutral-carrier, pH-sensitive microelectrodes, which also record the membrane potential. We have compared two procedures for calibrating the ratio of the BCECF signal, excited at 440 nm and 495 nm: 1) the cell membrane was H(+)-permeabilized with nigericin in high-K+ saline at different external pH (pHo) values, and 2) the pHi of intact cells was perturbed in CO2/HCO3(-) -buffered saline of different pH, and the BCECF ratio was calibrated according to a simultaneous microelectrode pH reading. As indicated by the microelectrode measurements, the pHi did not fully equilibrate to the pHo values in nigericin-containing, high-K+ saline, but deviated by -0.12 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SEM, n = 37) pH units. In intact cells, the microelectrode readings yielded up to 0.15 pH unit lower values than the calibrated BCECF signal. In addition, larger dye injections into the cells (&gt; 100 microM) caused an irreversible membrane potential loss indicative of some damage to the cells. The amplitude and kinetics of slow pHi changes were equally followed by both sensors, and the dye ratio recorded slightly higher amplitudes during faster pHi shifts as induced by the addition and removal of NH4+.",M1
8815198,"Relationship between intracellular calcium and its muffling measured by calcium iontophoresis in snail neurones.1. We have measured intracellular free calcium <e>ion</e> concentration ([Ca2+]i) with fura-2, and intracellular chloride with chloride-sensitive microelectrodes, in voltage-clamped snail neurones. By making iontophoretic injections of CaCl2 we have investigated calcium muffling, the sum of the processes which minimize the calcium transient, at different values of [Ca2+]i. 2. By injection of calcium into cell-sized droplets of buffer we measured the calcium transport index. It was stable over the range pCa 6-7.4 (0.48 +/- 0.06 measured at pCa 6.70 +/- 0.12, n = 5). 3. Measurement of intracellular chloride activity during a series of fura-2-KCl pressure injections revealed a nearly linear relationship between fura-2 Ca(2+)-insensitive fluorescence and the sum of the increments in intracellular chloride. This allowed us to calculate the intracellular fura-2 concentration ([fura-2]i). 4. The rate of recovery of [Ca2+]i following a depolarization-induced load was increased by low [fura-2]i (10-20 microM) but decreased by higher [fura-2]i (40-80 microM). These effects are consistent with the addition of a mobile buffer to the cytoplasm. 5. Iontophoresis of Ca2+ at various membrane potentials allowed us to calculate the intracellular calcium muffling power (the amount of calcium required to cause a transient tenfold increase in [Ca2+]i per unit volume) and calcium muffling ratio (number of Ca2+ ions injected divided by the maximum increase in [Ca2+]i per unit volume) at different values of [Ca2+]i. 6. Calcium muffling power at resting [Ca2+]i was approximately 40 microM Ca2+ (pCa unit)-1, (about 250 times less than for hydrogen ions). It increased linearly about fivefold with [Ca2+]i over the range 20-120 nM (10 cells, 153 measurements) and therefore exponentially with decreasing pCa. 7. The calcium muffling ratio appeared to be constant (361 +/- 14, n = 10 cells, 130 measurements) over the range 20-120 nM Ca2+. 8. In three experiments we modelled the additional calcium buffering power produced by multiple pressure injections of fura-2 into voltage-clamped snail neurones. Back-extrapolation of the increases in calcium buffering power allowed us to calculate the calcium muffling power of the neurones. 9. Small increases in [fura-2]i (approximately 10 microM) significantly increased intracellular calcium muffling power in individual experiments. However, the variability among neurones in intracellular calcium muffling power was large enough to obscure the additional buffering produced by fura-2 in pooled experiments.",M1
8884919,"Changes of extracellular space volume and tortuosity in the spinal cord of Lewis rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.Three diffusion parameters of nervous tissue, extracellular space (ECS) volume fraction (alpha), tortuosity (gamma) and non-specific uptake (k') of tetramethylammonium (TMA+), were studied in the spinal cord of rats during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The three parameters were determined in vivo from concentration-time profiles of TMA+ using <e>ion</e>-selective microelectrodes. EAE was induced by injection of guinea-pig myelin basic protein (MBP), which resulted in typical morphological changes in the CNS tissue, namely inflammatory reaction, astrogliosis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and paralysis. EAE was accompanied by a statistically significant increase of alpha (mean +/- S.E.M.) in the dorsal horn from 0.21 +/- 0.01 to 0.28 +/- 0.02, in the intermediate region from 0.22 +/- 0.01 to 0.33 +/- 0.02, in the ventral horn from 0.23 +/- 0.01 to 0.47 +/- 0.02 and in white matter from 0.18 +/- 0.03 to 0.30 +/- 0.03. There were significant decreases in tortuosity in the dorsal horn and in the intermediate region and decreases in non-specific uptake in the intermediate region and in the ventral horn. Although the inflammatory reaction and the astrogliosis preceded and greatly outlasted the neurological symptoms, the BBB damage had a similar time course. Moreover, there was a close correlation between the changes in extracellular space diffusion parameters and the manifestation of neurological signs. We suggest that the expansion of the extracellular space alters the diffusion properties in the spinal cord. This may affect synaptic as well as non-synaptic transmission, intercellular communication and recovery from acute EAE, and may contribute to the manifestation of neurological signs in EAE rats.",M1
8553388,"Effects of cerebral ischemia on N-methyl-D-aspartate and dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium currents. An electrophysiological study in the rat hippocampus in situ.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During cerebral ischemia, both promoting and limiting factors are present for activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor <e>ion</e> channel and the dihydropyridine (DHP)-sensitive Ca2+ channels. We investigated the activity of these channels during ischemia and reperfusion in the rat hippocampus in situ. METHODS: Reversible ischemia was induced by bilateral carotid artery ligation. NMDA and BAY K8644 were applied by iontophoresis or pneumatic ejection, and extracellular field potential and resistance changes were recorded from the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Resting membrane potentials of the CA1 neurons were also recorded. RESULTS: DC potential shifts produced by NMDA and BAY K8644 were reduced when ischemia depressed the evoked activity more than 50%. They disappeared on total failure of synaptic transmission and recovered during reperfusion. When the evoked activity was depressed less than 50%, DC shifts were greater than their preischemic values; however, BAY K8644-induced potentiation did not reach statistical significance. CA1 neurons were depolarized during ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that ischemia severe enough to cause transmission failure inactivates NMDA and DHP-sensitive Ca2+ currents. During less intense ischemia and reperfusion, NMDA and DHP-sensitive Ca2+ channels are functional, and their overactivation may lead to neurotoxicity.",M1

8592657,"The electrical characteristics of human skin in vivo.PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to investigate the impedance properties of human skin in vivo and to examine the effect of iontophoresis upon them. METHODS: Having established the intra- and inter-individual variation in basal values of skin impedance, the effect of varying iontophoretic current density, ionic strength and counter-<e>ion</e> on the rate of recovery of skin impedance after iontophoresis was investigated. RESULTS: Passage of an iontophoretic current caused a significant reduction in the magnitude of the skin impedance. Increasing the current density caused an even greater reduction in the value of the skin impedance and slowed the rate of recovery. Reduction of the ionic strength resulted in an increase in the rate of recovery following iontophoresis. A significant increase in the rate of recovery was observed when CaCl2 replaced NaCl as the electrolyte. Although visual inspection revealed the presence of greater erythema when CaCl2 was used, there was an absence of the mild sensation experienced by volunteers when using NaCl. The last part of the study established a correlation between transepidermal water loss and impedance analysis as complementary methods for probing skin barrier function in vivo. The data were fitted to an equivalent circuit consisting of a resistor in parallel with a constant-phase element and a mechanistic model proposed to explain the electrical properties of the skin. CONCLUSIONS: The first comprehensive investigation of the effect of iontophoresis on the electrical properties of human skin in vivo has been described. It would appear from the results, and from their interpretation, that impedance spectroscopy may be an effective method to quantify the impact of iontophoresis on the skin, and to determine the extent to which proposed drug delivery regimens will perturb skin barrier function.",M1
8587053,"Transdermal iontophoresis and solute penetration across excised human skin.The potential of transdermal iontophoresis to facilitate drug delivery was evaluated by studying the transport kinetics of model compounds salicylate (anion), phenylethylamine (cation), mannitol (polar neutral compound of low molecular weight), and inulin (polar neutral compound of high molecular weight) using an excised human skin model. The transport kinetics of solutes were determined across both intact and cellophane-tape-stripped dermatomed skin both in the presence and absence of applied current to probe the mechanisms of iontophoretic delivery. Iontophoresis effectively enhanced delivery of all compounds relative to passive transport. The skin is shown to be both <e>ion</e> selective and size selective. On the basis of results from present work and other studies, the  aqueous pathway  of iontophoretic transport is further reinforced.",M1
8974989,"Endolymph volume changes during osmotic dehydration measured by two marker techniques.The processes underlying endolymph volume regulation during osmotic disturbances were investigated in vivo using ionic volume markers. The markers utilized were tetramethylammonium (TMA+) or hexafluoroarsenate (AsF6-). Both <e>ions</e> were used in concentrations low enough not to be toxic, but readily detectable by ion-selective microelectrodes (typically &lt; 1 mM). Two marker techniques were developed. In one, termed the 'perfused volume marker' (PVM) method, the marker was loaded into endolymph throughout the cochlea by perfusion of the perilymphatic space. Concentration changes of the marker were measured with a double-barreled ion-selective microelectrode. These recordings were insensitive to longitudinal movements of endolymph. The second technique, termed the 'iontophoresed volume marker' (IVM) method, utilized a localized, iontophoretic injection of marker into endolymph. In this method, marker changes were recorded from two ion-selective electrodes, one placed basal and one placed apical to the injection site. These data were used to compute changes in cross-sectional area and longitudinal movements of endolymph. Changes in endolymph volume were induced by perfusion of the perilymphatic space with hypertonic media. The endolymph potassium increase produced by osmotic dehydration was of similar magnitude and time course to that of a volume marker loaded by the PVM method. Using the IVM method, it was shown that these concentration increases arose by two distinct processes. One component was the area decrease of scala media. A second component was a small apically directed movement of endolymph during dehydration, thereby concentrating the available electrolytes within a smaller volume. This latter component was estimated to contribute approximately one third of the electrolyte increase during dehydration. Both the present and previous studies show that in the undisturbed state, longitudinal endolymph movements are extremely small and cannot make a significant contribution to ionic homeostasis. However, when endolymph volume is disturbed, longitudinal movements contribute to the electrolyte changes and are part of the compensation process. This study provides the first direct evidence supporting the long-standing hypotheses that local, radial homeostasis and longitudinal volume corrections both occur in the mammalian cochlea.",M1
7472364,"Extracellular potassium, volume fraction, and tortuosity in rat hippocampal CA1, CA3, and cortical slices during ischemia.1. An in vitro slice model of ischemia was used to study changes in extracellular potassium concentration and diffusion properties in the stratum pyramidale of CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and in the cortex of the rat. Slices were submerged in artificial cerebrospinal fluid, and ischemia was induced by removing oxygen and glucose until anoxic depolarization occurred. 2. Extracellular potassium concentration was measured with a valinomycin-based <e>ion</e>-selective microelectrode. The bathing medium contained 5 mM potassium, and in vitro ischemia caused the potassium concentration to rise to 45 mM in CA1, 12 mM in CA3, and 32 mM in cortex. 3. Extracellular volume fraction and tortuosity were determined during normoxic conditions and in vitro ischemia by measuring the diffusion of tetramethylammonium. This cation was iontophoretically released into the extracellular space and its concentration as a function of time determined with an ion-selective microelectrode approximately 100 microns away from the source. 4. During normoxia the volume fraction was 0.14, 0.20, and 0.18, and tortuosity was 1.50, 1.57, and 1.62 in CA1, CA3, and cortex, respectively. These data confirm that the volume fraction of CA1 is smaller than in the two other regions. 5. During ischemia the volume fraction decreased to 0.05, 0.17, and 0.09 in CA1, CA3, and cortex, respectively. Only in CA3 did the tortuosity change significantly by increasing to 1.75. Because of limitations in the time resolution of the diffusion method, the changes in volume fraction and tortuosity during the anoxic depolarization phase of ischemia may have been underestimated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
7708218,"Failure of neuronal <e>ion</e> exchange, not potentiated excitation, causes excitotoxicity after inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation.Neuronal cell death during impaired energy metabolism is often attributed to increased activity at glutamate receptors, but this increase has not been directly demonstrated. We recorded responses to glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate in hippocampal slice CA1 neurons and glia while inhibiting mitochondrial complex II with 3-nitropropionic acid. As the period of inhibition increased, neuronal depolarization following bath application of glutamate (5 mM) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (50 microM) increased dramatically. However, depolarization upon iontophoresis of glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate decreased with time. A transient hyperpolarization, reflecting electrogenic sodium pump activity, was present immediately after responses to iontophoretic glutamate agonists. In the presence of the inhibitor, this hyperpolarization decreased and eventually disappeared. Even the repolarization seen upon washing of the iontophoretic or bath application of glutamate or N-methyl-D-aspartate was incomplete. Glial depolarization upon bath application of glutamate increased during inhibition, while glial depolarization upon application of N-methyl-D-aspartate decreased. Application of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists aminophosphonovaleric acid (100 microM) or MK-801 (20 microM) resulted in a delay of further depolarization when applied early during the terminal decay of membrane potential following metabolic inhibition. We conclude that during impaired oxidative phosphorylation the failure of repolarizing mechanisms, not potentiated neuronal depolarization by excitants, is the primary cause of the terminal depolarization. Large glial depolarization increases the demand for neuronal ion exchange which cannot be met in situations of reduced energy metabolism. Our results provide further evidence that acute and chronic blockade of energy metabolism have different effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1

Most of the PGCL neurons tested (18/20, 90%) showed an excitatory response to H+ and the response was dose dependent, but none was inhibited. The results suggested that there were H+ sensitive cells in PGCL and these cells may be involved in central chemoreception.",M1
7830250,"A linear theory of transdermal transport phenomena.A theory of charge, fluid-mass, and solute (including macromolecular) transport through porous media is applied to describe transport phenomena across the external layer of mammalian skin. Linear relationships are derived between transport fluxes and applied fields. These relationships introduce six effective transdermal transport coefficients. Formulas for each of these coefficients are provided. The practical relevance of these parameters is emphasized in the specific context of transdermal drug delivery. By employing typical physiological values for the various geometrical and physicochemical parameters that appear in the formulas for the transdermal transport coefficients, predictions are made for transport rates of charge, fluid mass, and solute species across a uniform-thickness skin sample contained within a diffusion-cell apparatus. These results are used to explore transdermal phenomena involving forced convection, current flow, electroosmosis, iontophoresis, and molecular diffusion (including convective dispersion). Comparisons with existing transdermal drug delivery data are made. On the basis of these comparisons, the theory suggests that transdermal transport in the presence of an electrical field may occur through corneocytes of the stratum corneum. The theory confirms the importance of a shunt route for small <e>ion</e> transport, as well as an intercellular route of transport for passive diffusion of noncharged substances. These latter conclusions, also based on comparisons with experimental data, are consistent with previous statements in the literature. A new form of solute transport enhancement, termed transdermal convective dispersion, is included in the theory, and methods for its measurement are described. Generalizations and future applications of the theory are discussed.",M1
8035222,"The regulation of chloride homeostasis in the small nonspiking visual interneurons of the fly compound eye.1. We have used intracellular recordings and ionophoretic injections in vivo to investigate the <e>ion</e> exchange mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of the ion gradients in the large monopolar cells (LMCs) of the first optic ganglion of the blowfly, Calliphora vicinia. 2. Ionophoretic chloride injections caused a rapid approximately 20-mV depolarization of the resting potential (Erp) and abolished or even reversed the light-ON response (OR), which is caused by histamine-gated chloride conductance, as the chloride equilibrium potential (ECl) was increased beyond the Erp, i.e., 50 mV upward. Ionophoretic sodium injections were found to mimic the action of the ionophoretic chloride injections and thus also to cause chloride accumulation inside the cell. 3. Ionophoretic injections of bicarbonate only had the effect of hyperpolarizing the Erp by 5-15 mV for 1-25 s, but chloride gradient, i.e., ECl remained unchanged. Intracellular proton load caused depolarization of the Erp by 15 +/- 5 mV (mean +/- SE) for 20-25 s and a slight 15 +/- 5-mV decrease of the peak OR. Ionophoretic injections of potassium, acetate, and furosemide failed to cause any physiological effect. 4. The time constant for the recovery of the peak OR after sodium load increased linearly as a function of injected charge whereby the time constant for the recovery after chloride accumulation increased slowly up to 50 nC of injected charge, after which it increased rapidly, possibly indicating substrate inhibition. The time constant for the recovery of peak OR after sodium load was from 5 to 65 nC greater than that of chloride.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
7518819,"Time course of endolymph volume increase in experimental hydrops measured in vivo with an ionic volume marker.A new method has been developed to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of scala media in the living cochlea. The method has some advantages over histological methods, in which tissues may shrink or move during processing. In the present study, scala media CSA was measured in the second turn of guinea-pig cochleas in which endolymphatic hydrops was induced surgically. The area measurement method used an iontophoretic injection of a volume marker into scala media, during which the concentration of marker in endolymph was monitored with an <e>ion</e>-selective microelectrode. The measured marker concentration was inversely proportional to the CSA of endolymph. The marker we used was the anion arsenic hexafluoride (AsF6-), which was almost ideal for the purpose as it was retained well in endolymph. Area was measured in normal animals and in hydropic animals at times from 4 days to 16 weeks after endolymphatic duct obstruction. The results showed that hydrops develops within days of ablation of the endolymphatic duct. The degree of hydrops was compared with electrophysiological measures of function, including the endocochlear potential, action potential thresholds and the amplitudes of the cochlear microphonic, summating potential and action potentials. In the initial stages of hydrops development, electrophysiological changes were small. In contrast, there were marked functional changes between 8 and 16 weeks, when endolymph volume was no longer increasing. If the same is true for dysfunction in the ears of patients with Ménière's Disease, then it may not be possible to restore normal function simply by alleviating the hydrops.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
8207679,"Role of conductivity in iontophoresis. 2. Anodal iontophoretic transport of phenylethylamine and sodium across excised human skin.The anodal iontophoretic transdermal delivery of a model cation, phenylethylamine (PEA), across excised human skin was investigated to define the role of conductivity in iontophoresis. The ratio of the specific conductance of PEA in deionized-distilled water to that of the solution applied in the donor compartment (buffer+PEA) was employed to assess the relationship between the flux of PEA and the conductivity. The flux of PEA was linearly related to the ratio of specific conductance at 5 and 20 mM PEA for a variety of experimental conditions. A curvilinear relationship was observed at 1 mM PEA concentration, particularly when the conductivity of the donor solution was low. It is therefore hypothesized that a threshold conductivity in solution exists above which a linear relationship between iontophoretic flux and specific conductance is observed. The present study confirms that conductivity of an <e>ion</e> in a solution provides a simple means of estimating the competitive transport between solute and other ions during transdermal iontophoresis.",M1
20534552,"Dynamic interactions between microbubbles in water.The interaction between moving bubbles, vapor voids in liquid, can arguably represent the simplest dynamical system in continuum mechanics as only a liquid and its vapor phase are involved. Surprisingly, and perhaps because of the ephemeral nature of bubbles, there has been no direct measurement of the time-dependent force between colliding bubbles which probes the effects of surface deformations and hydrodynamic flow on length scales down to nanometers. Using ultrasonically generated microbubbles (approximately 100 microm size) that have been accurately positioned in an atomic force microscope, we have made direct measurements of the force between two bubbles in water under controlled collision conditions that are similar to Brownian particles in solution. The experimental results together with detailed modeling reveal the nature of hydrodynamic boundary conditions at the air/water interface, the importance of the coupling of hydrodynamic flow, attractive van der Waals-Lifshitz forces, and bubble deformation in determining the conditions and mechanisms that lead to bubble coalescence. The observed behavior differs from intuitions gained from previous studies conducted using rigid particles. These direct force measurements reveal no specific <e>ion</e> effects at high ionic strengths or any special role of thermal fluctuations in film thickness in triggering the onset of bubble coalescence.",M2

20511678,"Free zinc <e>ions</e> outside a narrow concentration range are toxic to a variety of cells in vitro.The zinc(II) ion has recently been implicated in a number of novel functions and pathologies in loci as diverse as the brain, retina, small intestine, prostate, heart, pancreas, and immune system. Zinc ions are a required nutrient but elevated concentrations are known to kill cells in vitro. Paradoxical observations regarding zinc's effects have appeared frequently in the literature, and often their physiological relevance is unclear. We found that for PC-12, HeLa and HT-29 cell lines as well as primary cultures of cardiac myocytes and neurons in vitro in differing media, approximately 5 nmol/L free zinc (pZn = 8.3, where pZn is defined as--log(10) [free Zn(2+)]) produced apparently healthy cells, but 20-fold higher or (in one case) lower concentrations were usually harmful as judged by multiple criteria. These results indicate that (1) the free zinc ion levels of media should be controlled with a metal ion buffer; (2) adding zinc or strong zinc ligands to an insufficiently buffered medium may lead to unpredictably low or high free zinc levels that are often harmful to cells; and (3) it is generally desirable to measure free zinc ion levels due to the presence of contaminating zinc in many biochemicals and unknown buffering capacity of many media.",M2

The method involves extraction of a 10 g sample with 10 mL ethyl acetate, cleanup by dispersive SPE with primary-secondary amine (25 mg) sorbent, and estimation by GC/MS/MS large volume injection (LVI) through a programmed temperature vaporizer (PTV) injector. The PTV-LVI parameters of the gas chromatograph and the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) parameters of the ion trap mass spectrometer were optimized for each compound to achieve the highest SIN. For each analyte, the unique and most abundant MRM transition was used for quantification, along with the next most abundant MRM transition for confirmatory identification. The abundance ratio of the confirmatory to quantifier MRMs was used to ensure unambiguous residue monitoring in unknown samples within a 20% tolerance range at the 10 ng/g level. The analytes were separated on a TR-5MS capillary column within a 22 min run time. The method was selective and sensitive and ensured separation of the synthetic pyrethroids from high-boiling matrix components. The LOD and LOQ of the analytes ranged between 0.5 to 3.1 and 2.5 to 10 ng/g, respectively. Linearity of solvent and matrix-matched calibrations between 2.0 and 250 ng/g was established for each compound with r2 &gt; 0.99.

This membrane was previously used in a polymer supported ultrafiltration (PSU) process to recover copper, using partially ethoxylated polyethylenimine as the water-soluble polymer. The membrane was characterized in four different operational states: new, new and cleaned, fouled in a PSU stage and cleaned after a PSU process. The influence of the membrane state on pore opening size distribution and roughness was studied, finding a 16% decrease in the former and a 20% increase in the latter due to foulant deposition upon the membrane active layer. Phase angle distribution was also analyzed to indicate the foulant spreading on the membrane surface. These phase angle measurements can be related to pore opening size and roughness, concluding that the cleaning procedure is not totally effective and that foulant presence on the membrane active layer is not remarkable. Finally, AFM was used to measure the influence of pH on adhesion forces between a silica probe and the membrane active layer. These results can be related to the flux evolution vs pH in PSU experiments, finding both lowest adhesion and highest flux at pH 6.",M2
20445239,"Analysis of multiple crystal forms of Bacillus subtilis BacB suggests a role for a metal <e>ion</e> as a nucleant for crystallization.Bacillus subtilis BacB is an oxidase that is involved in the production of the antibiotic bacilysin. This protein contains two double-stranded beta-helix (cupin) domains fused in a compact arrangement. BacB crystallizes in three crystal forms under similar crystallization conditions. An interesting observation was that a slight perturbation of the crystallization droplet resulted in the nucleation of a different crystal form. An X-ray absorption scan of BacB suggested the presence of cobalt and iron in the crystal. Here, a comparative analysis of the different crystal forms of BacB is presented in an effort to identify the basis for the different lattices. It is noted that metal ions mediating interactions across the asymmetric unit dominate the different packing arrangements. Furthermore, a normalized B-factor analysis of all the crystal structures suggests that the solvent-exposed metal ions decrease the flexibility of a loop segment, perhaps influencing the choice of crystal form. The residues coordinating the surface metal ion are similar in the triclinic and monoclinic crystal forms. The coordinating ligands for the corresponding metal ion in the tetragonal crystal form are different, leading to a tighter packing arrangement. Although BacB is a monomer in solution, a dimer of BacB serves as a template on which higher order symmetrical arrangements are formed. The different crystal forms of BacB thus provide experimental evidence for metal-ion-mediated lattice formation and crystal packing.",M2
20443467,"Evaluation of an a-Si EPID in direct detection configuration as a water-equivalent dosimeter for transit dosimetry.PURPOSE: A major problem associated with amorphous silicon (a-Si) electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) for transit dosimetry is the presence of a phosphor layer, which can introduce large deviations from water-equivalent behavior due to energy-dependent response and visible light scattering. In this study, an amorphous silicon EPID was modified to a direct detection configuration by removing the phosphor layer, and the accuracy of using it for transit dosimetry measurements was investigated for 6 and 18 MV treatment beams by comparison to <e>ion</e>-chamber in water measurements. METHODS: Solid water and copper were both evaluated as buildup materials. Using the optimum buildup thickness in each case, effects of changes in radiation field size, source to detector distance, and patient/phantom thickness were investigated by comparison to reference measurements made by an ionization chamber on the central axis. The off-axis response of the imager was also investigated by comparison of EPID image profiles to dose profiles obtained by a scanning ionization chamber in a water tank with various thicknesses of slab phantoms, and an anthropomorphic phantom in the beam using Gamma evaluation (3%, 3 mm criteria). The imaging characteristics of the direct EPID were investigated by comparison to a commercial EPID using QC3V phantom, and by taking images of an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom containing fiducial gold markers. RESULTS: Either 30 mm of solid water or 3.3 mm of copper were found to be the most suitable buildup thicknesses with solid water providing more accurate results. Using solid water buildup, the EPID response compared to the reference dosimeter within 2% for all conditions except phantom thicknesses larger than 25 cm in 6 MV beams, which was up to 6.5%. Gamma evaluation results comparing EPID profiles and reference ionization chamber profiles showed that for 6 and 18 MV beams, at least 91.8% and 90.9% of points had a Gamma &lt;1 for all phantoms, respectively. But using copper buildup, the EPID response had more discrepancies from the ionization chamber reference measurements, including: More than 2% difference for small air gaps using 6 MV beams, up to 8% difference for phantom thicknesses larger than 25 cm in 6 MV beams, and large differences (up to 9.3%) for increasing phantom thicknesses in 18 MV beams. The percentage of points with Gamma &lt;1 with copper buildup were at least 96.6% and 99.8% in 6 and 18 MV beams, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The direct EPID performs as an ion-chamber detector for transit dosimetry applications in all geometries studied except for small discrepancies at 6 MV for thick phantoms. This can be ameliorated by the calibration of the EPID to dose at an intermediate phantom thickness. The major current limitation of the direct EPID is poor quality of images compared with the clinical configuration, which could be overcome by a method to interchange between imaging and dosimetry setups.",M2
20435998,"The potential role of metal <e>ion</e> release as a marker of loosening in patients with total knee replacement: a cohort study.We investigated the role of ion release in the assessment of fixation of the implant after total knee replacement and hypothesised that ion monitoring could be a useful parameter in the diagnosis of prosthetic loosening. We enrolled 59 patients with unilateral procedures and measured their serum aluminium, titanium, chromium and cobalt ion levels, blinded to the clinical and radiological outcome which was considered to be the reference standard. The cut-off levels for detection of the ions were obtained by measuring the levels in 41 healthy blood donors who had no implants. Based on the clinical and radiological evaluation the patients were divided into two groups with either stable (n = 24) or loosened (n = 35) implants. A significant increase in the mean level of Cr ions was seen in the group with failed implants (p = 0.001). The diagnostic accuracy was 71% providing strong evidence of failure when the level of Cr ions exceeded the cut-off value. The possibility of distinguishing loosening from other causes of failure was demonstrated by the higher diagnostic accuracy of 83%, when considering only patients with failure attributable to loosening. Measurement of the serum level of Cr ions may be of value for detecting failure due to loosening when the diagnosis is in doubt. The other metal ions studies did not have any diagnostic value.",M2

While human serum did not induce DXR-release, mouse serum significantly induced DXR-release in a temperature- and time-dependent manner. Release of DXR was clearly observed in ultrafiltrated mouse serum, indicating that low-molecular substances affect DXR-release. Therefore, the level of Na+, Cl(-), NH4+, and urea nitrogen in each type of serum was measured. Only the concentration of NH4+ in mouse serum was significantly higher than that in human serum. Furthermore, addition of ammonium acetate to human serum induced DXR release at the same level observed in mouse serum. These results indicate that the NH4+ concentration in serum might greatly affect the release of DXR from liposomes.",M2

Because of the high hydrophobicity of the compound, the interaction between clotrimazole and the <e>ion</e> pump occurs at the membrane domain in the apolar core of the membrane. The enzymatic activity was inhibited with a half-saturating concentration of 5.2 microM. Various partial reactions of the pump cycle were analyzed with the electrochromic styryl dye RH421 that has been widely used to study the transport mechanism of P-type ATPases. We discovered that the interaction of clotrimazole with the H,K-ATPase introduces a single  dead-end  branch added to the Post-Albers scheme in the E(1) state of the pump. In this inhibiting state, the ion binding sites have a significantly enhanced affinity for protons and bind up to two protons even at pH 8.5. Inhibition of the pump can be reversed by a decreased pH or increased K(+) concentrations. The mechanistic proposal that allows an explanation of all experiments presented is similar to that published for the Na,K-ATPase.",M2
20419213,"<e>Ion</e> mobility mass spectrometry of proteins and protein assemblies.Traditionally, mass spectrometry has been a powerful analytical method enabling the structural analysis of small molecules, and later on peptides and proteins. With the advent of native mass spectrometry, using a combination of electrospray ionisation and time of flight analysis, mass spectrometry could also be applied to the mass determination of large protein complexes such as ribosomes and whole viruses. More recently, ion mobility has been coupled to mass spectrometry providing a new dimension in the analysis of biomolecules, with ion mobility separating ions according to differences in size and shape. In the context of native mass spectrometry, ion mobility mass spectrometry opens up avenues for the detailed structural analysis of large and heterogeneous protein complexes, providing information on the stoichiometry, topology and cross section of these assemblies and their composite subunits. With these characteristics, ion mobility mass spectrometry offers a complementary tool in the context of structural biology. Here, we critically review the development, instrumentation, approaches and applications of ion mobility in combination with mass spectrometry, focusing on the analysis of larger proteins and protein assemblies (185 references).",M2
20415433,"Semisynthesis of NaK, a Na(+) and K(+) conducting <e>ion</e> channel.In this contribution, we describe the semisynthesis of NaK, a bacterial nonselective cation channel. In the semisynthesis, the NaK polypeptide is assembled from a recombinantly expressed thioester peptide and a chemically synthesized peptide using the native chemical ligation reaction. We describe a temporary tagging strategy for the purification of the hydrophobic synthetic peptide and demonstrate the efficient ligation of the synthetic peptide with the recombinant peptide thioester to form the semisynthetic NaK polypeptide. Following assembly, the NaK polypeptide is folded in vitro to the native state using lipid vesicles. Functional characterization of the folded semisynthetic NaK channels indicates that it is functionally similar to the wild-type protein. We used semisynthesis to substitute aspartate 66 in the selectivity filter region of the NaK channel with the unnatural amino acids homoserine and cysteine sulfonic acid. Functional analysis of these mutants suggests that the presence of a negatively charged residue in the vicinity of the ion binding sites is necessary for optimal flux of ions through the NaK channel.",M2
20406700,"Specificity and mutational analysis of the metal-dependent 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans.3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS) catalyzes the reaction between phosphoenol pyruvate and D-arabinose 5-phosphate to generate KDO8P. This reaction is part of the biosynthetic pathway to 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate, a component of the lipopolysaccharide of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall. Two distinct groups of KDO8PSs exist, differing by the absolute requirement of a divalent metal <e>ion</e>. In this study Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans KDO8PS has been expressed and purified and shown to require a divalent metal ion, with Mn2+, Co2+ and Cd2+ (in decreasing order) being able to restore activity to metal-free enzyme. Cd2+ significantly enhanced the stability of the enzyme, raising the Tm by 14 degrees C. D-glucose 6-phosphate and D-erythrose 4-phosphate were not substrates for A. ferrooxidans KDO8PS, whereas 2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate was a poor substrate and there was negligible activity with D-ribose 5-phosphate. The 243AspGlyPro245 motif is absolutely conserved in the metal-independent group of synthases, but the Gly and Pro sites are variable in the metal-dependent enzymes. Substitution of the putative metal-binding Asp243 to Ala in A. ferrooxidans KDO8PS gave inactive enzyme, whereas substitutions Asp243Glu or Pro245Ala produced active enzymes with altered metal-dependency profiles. Prior studies indicated that exchange of a metal-binding Cys for Asn converts metal-dependent KDO8P synthase into a metal-independent form. Unexpectedly, this mutation in A. ferrooxidans KDO8P synthase (Cys21Asn) gave inactive enzyme. This finding, together with modest activity towards 2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate suggests similarities between the A. ferrooxidans KDO8PS and the related metal-dependent 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate phosphate synthase, and highlights the importance of the AspGlyPro loop in positioning the substrate for effective catalysis in all KDO8P synthases.",M2

Genetic variation in the ability of roots to exclude Na(+) and Cl(-) from the transpiration stream flowing to the shoot has been associated with salinity tolerance in many species. The maintenance of a high uptake of K(+) is also essential, so measurements of Na(+), K(+) or Cl(-) are frequently used to screen for genetic variation in salinity tolerance. As these ions are not bound covalently to compounds in cells, they can be readily extracted with dilute acid. Na(+) and K(+) can be measured in a dilute nitric acid extract using a flame photometer, by atomic absorption spectrometry or by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-atomic emission spectrometry. Cl(-) can be measured in the same acid extract with a chloridometer or colorimetrically using a spectrophotometer.",M2
20387054,"Determination and detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and electrolyte leakage in plants.Reactive oxygen species or intermediates are formed by the incomplete reduction of oxygen. Organisms living in aerobic environment generate various kinds of reactive oxygen species (ROS) molecules, such as superoxide (*O(2)(-)), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), hydroxyl radical (OH(-)), singlet oxygen, and lipid hydroperoxides. ROS are highly reactive molecules and are extremely unstable, so detection of ROS relies on measuring the end products that are formed when they react with particular substances. The end products can be measured by changes in their fluorescence, color, or luminescence. ROS causes lipid peroxidation wherein the lipids in the cell membranes are damaged. Lipid peroxidation is usually quantified using a colorimetric assay. When ROS concentrations reach a certain threshold, it activates a programmed cell death response in the cells. This is quantified by measuring the amount of <e>ion</e> leakage. ROS such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide have been detected traditionally by staining techniques. Superoxide anion is detected with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and hydrogen peroxide by Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) staining. In this chapter, methods for determining total ROS and lipid peroxidation assay, histochemical staining techniques for superoxide and H(2)O(2) molecules are described.",M2
20385770,"SORLA/SORL1 functionally interacts with SPAK to control renal activation of Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter 2.Proper control of NaCl excretion in the kidney is central to bodily functions, yet many mechanisms that regulate reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the kidney remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify an important role played by the intracellular sorting receptor SORLA (sorting protein-related receptor with A-type repeats) in functional activation of renal <e>ion</e> transporters. We demonstrate that SORLA is expressed in epithelial cells of the thick ascending limb (TAL) of Henle's loop and that lack of receptor expression in this cell type in SORLA-deficient mice results in an inability to properly reabsorb sodium and chloride during osmotic stress. The underlying cellular defect was correlated with an inability of the TAL to phosphorylate Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter 2 (NKCC2), the major sodium transporter in the distal nephron. SORLA functionally interacts with Ste-20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK), an activator of NKCC2, and receptor deficiency is associated with missorting of SPAK. Our data suggest a novel regulatory pathway whereby intracellular trafficking of SPAK by the sorting receptor SORLA is crucial for proper NKCC2 activation and for maintenance of renal ion balance.",M2
20385552,"Unique bell-shaped voltage-dependent modulation of Na+ channel gating by novel insect-selective toxins from the spider Agelena orientalis.Spider venoms provide a highly valuable source of peptide toxins that act on a wide diversity of membrane-bound receptors and <e>ion</e> channels. In this work, we report isolation, biochemical analysis, and pharmacological characterization of a novel family of spider peptide toxins, designated beta/delta-agatoxins. These toxins consist of 36-38 amino acid residues and originate from the venom of the agelenid funnel-web spider Agelena orientalis. The presented toxins show considerable amino acid sequence similarity to other known toxins such as mu-agatoxins, curtatoxins, and delta-palutoxins-IT from the related spiders Agelenopsis aperta, Hololena curta, and Paracoelotes luctuosus. beta/delta-Agatoxins modulate the insect Na(V) channel (DmNa(V)1/tipE) in a unique manner, with both the activation and inactivation processes being affected. The voltage dependence of activation is shifted toward more hyperpolarized potentials (analogous to site 4 toxins) and a non-inactivating persistent Na(+) current is induced (site 3-like action). Interestingly, both effects take place in a voltage-dependent manner, producing a bell-shaped curve between -80 and 0 mV, and they are absent in mammalian Na(V) channels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed report of peptide toxins with such a peculiar pharmacological behavior, clearly indicating that traditional classification of toxins according to their binding sites may not be as exclusive as previously assumed.",M2
20384999,"Effect of negative air <e>ions</e> on the potential for bacterial contamination of plastic medical equipment.BACKGROUND: In recent years there has been renewed interest in the use of air ionizers to control the spread of infection in hospitals and a number of researchers have investigated the biocidal action of ions in both air and nitrogen. By comparison, the physical action of air ions on bacterial dissemination and deposition has largely been ignored. However, there is clinical evidence that air ions might play an important role in preventing the transmission of Acinetobacter infection. Although the reasons for this are unclear, it is hypothesized that a physical effect may be responsible: the production of air ions may negatively charge items of plastic medical equipment so that they repel, rather than attract, airborne bacteria. By negatively charging both particles in the air and items of plastic equipment, the ionizers minimize electrostatic deposition on these items. In so doing they may help to interrupt the transmission of Acinetobacter infection in certain healthcare settings such as intensive care units. METHODS: A study was undertaken in a mechanically ventilated room under ambient conditions to accurately measure changes in surface potential exhibited by items of plastic medical equipment in the presence of negative air ions. Plastic items were suspended on nylon threads, either in free space or in contact with a table surface, and exposed to negative ions produced by an air ionizer. The charge build-up on the specimens was measured using an electric field mill while the ion concentration in the room air was recorded using a portable ion counter. RESULTS: The results of the study demonstrated that common items of equipment such as ventilator tubes rapidly developed a large negative charge (i.e. generally &gt;-100V) in the presence of a negative air ionizer. While most items of equipment tested behaved in a similar manner to this, one item, a box from a urological collection and monitoring system (the only item made from styrene acrylonitrile), did however develop a positive charge in the presence of the ionizer. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study suggest that the action of negative air ionizers significantly alters the electrostatic landscape of the clinical environment, and that this has the potential to cause any Acinetobacter-bearing particles in the air to be strongly repelled from some plastic surfaces and attracted to others. In so doing, this may prevent critical items of equipment from becoming contaminated with the bacterium.",M2
20384288,"Hydration properties of the bromide aqua <e>ion</e>: the interplay of first principle and classical molecular dynamics, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.The hydration properties of the bromide aqua ion have been investigated using state of the art density functional theory (DFT) based molecular dynamics with dispersion-corrected atom-centered pseudopotentials for water and classical molecular dynamics simulations. The reliability of the theoretical results has been assessed by comparing the attained structural results with the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experimental data. The EXAFS technique is mainly sensitive to short distances around the bromine atom, and it is a direct probe of the local solvation structure. The comparison shows that the DFT simulation delivers a good description of the EXAFS experimental signal, while classical simulation performs poorly. The main reason behind this is the neglect of polarization effects in the classical ion-water interaction potentials. By taking advantage of the reliable information on the Br(-) local hydration structure it has been possible to highlight the contribution of hydrogen atoms to the EXAFS spectra of halide aqueous systems.",M2

Non ion implanted nickel-titanium wire (Neo Sentalloy) was used as control. The anodic corrosion behavior was examined by potentiodynamic polarization measurement. The surfaces of the specimens were examined with SEM. The elemental depth profiles were characterized by XPS. Neo Sentalloy Ionguard in artificial saliva and Butler F Mouthrinse (500 ppm) had a lower current density than Neo Sentalloy. In addition, breakdown potential of Neo Sentalloy Ionguard in Ora-Bliss (900 ppm) was much higher than that of Neo Sentalloy although both wires had similar corrosion potential in Ora-Bliss (450 and 900 ppm). The XPS results for Neo Sentalloy Ionguard suggested that the layers consisted of TiO(2) and TiN were present on the surface and the layers may improve the corrosion properties.",M2
20371992,"[Conformational regulation of amyloid beta-peptide by lipid membranes and metal <e>ions</e>]Conformational transition of monomeric amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) to a self-associated beta-sheet structure is considered to be an initial step in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Several lines of evidence suggest that physiologically abundant lipid membranes and metal ions are involved in this step. We have demonstrated that Abeta binds to the phosphatidylcholine membrane in the lamellar gel phase but not in the liquid crystalline phase by using fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The membrane-bound Abeta molecule takes alpha-helical or beta-sheet structure depending on the temperature. Tightly packed phosphatidylcholine membranes appear to serve as a platform for non-electrostatic binding and self-association of Abeta. We have also examined Zn(II) and Cu(II) binding modes of Abeta by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra demonstrate that three histidine residues in the N-terminal region of Abeta provide primary metal binding sites. Zn(II) binds to the N(tau) atom of histidine and the peptide aggregates through intermolecular His-Zn-His bridges. In contrast, Cu(II) ion is chelated by the N(pi) atom of histidine and deprotonated main-chain amide nitrogens to form a soluble complex. Our findings on the conformational regulation of Abeta may help in better understanding the molecular basis for the development of Alzheimer's disease.",M2

20369814,"Removal of sediment and bacteria from water using green chemistry.Although nearly all newly derived water purification methods have improved the water quality in developing countries, few have been accepted and maintained for long-term use. Field studies indicate that the most beneficial methods use indigenous resources, as they are both accessible and accepted by communities they help.

As diatomic <e>ions</e> are known to affect both mucilage and promote cell aggregation, CaCl(2) was studied in conjunction and compared with mucilage as a bacteria removal method. To evaluate performance, ion-rich waters that mimic natural water bodies were prepared.

Bacillus cereus tests displayed flocculation and improved settling times with mucilage concentrations lower than 5 ppm and removal rates between 97 and 98% were observed for high bacteria concentration tests (&gt;10(8) cells/ml).

For small applied electric field, the ion transport can be understood from simple analytic arguments, which are supported by Monte Carlo simulations.

20363740,"Structure of Shigella IpgB2 in complex with human RhoA: implications for the mechanism of bacterial guanine nucleotide exchange factor mimicry.A common theme in bacterial pathogenesis is the manipulation of eukaryotic cells by targeting the cytoskeleton. This is in most cases achieved either by modifying actin, or indirectly via activation of key regulators controlling actin dynamics such as Rho-GTPases. A novel group of bacterial virulence factors termed the WXXXE family has emerged as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for these GTPases. The precise mechanism of nucleotide exchange, however, has remained unclear. Here we report the structure of the WXXXE-protein IpgB2 from Shigella flexneri and its complex with human RhoA. We unambiguously identify IpgB2 as a bacterial RhoA-GEF and dissect the molecular mechanism of GDP release, an essential prerequisite for GTP binding. Our observations uncover that IpgB2 induces conformational changes on RhoA mimicking DbI- but not DOCK family GEFs. We also show that dissociation of the GDP.Mg(2+) complex is preceded by the displacement of the metal <e>ion</e> to the alpha-phosphate of the nucleotide, diminishing its affinity to the GTPase. These data refine our understanding of the mode of action not only of WXXXE GEFs but also of mammalian GEFs of the DH/PH family.",M2

The three-dimensional structure of mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase from Thermus thermophilus HB27 in its binary complex form, with GDP-alpha-D-mannose and Mg(2+), shows a second metal binding site, about 6 A away from the mannose moiety. Kinetic and mutagenesis studies have shown that this metal site plays a role in catalysis. Additionally, Asp(167) in the DXD motif is found within van der Waals contact distance of the C1' atom in the mannopyranose ring, suggesting its action as a catalytic nucleophile, either in the formation of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate according to the double-displacement S(N)2 reaction mechanism or in the stabilization of the oxocarbenium ion-like intermediate according to the D(N)*A(Nss) (S(N)i-like) reaction mechanism.

Up to 40% of cattle embryos die within 3 weeks of fertilisation while they are nutritionally dependent on oviduct and uterine fluids for their survival. Inadequate systemic progesterone is one of the factors contributing to this loss. We have characterised the effects of changes in systemic progesterone on amino acid, ion and energy substrate composition of oviduct and uterine fluids on Days 3 and 6, respectively, of the oestrus cycle in cattle. Oviduct and uterine fluids were collected in situ following infusion of progesterone. There was no effect of progesterone on oviduct fluid secretion rate; however, uterine fluid secretion rate was lowered. Progesterone increased uterine glucose, decreased oviduct sulfate and, to a lesser degree, oviduct sodium, but had no effect on any of the ions in the uterus. The most marked effect of progesterone was on oviducal amino acid concentrations, with a twofold increase in glycine, whereas in the uterus only valine was increased. These results provide novel information on the maternal environment of the early cattle embryo and provide further evidence of progesterone regulation of oviduct amino acid concentrations in cattle.",M2

20351246,"Elongated oligomers in beta2-microglobulin amyloid assembly revealed by <e>ion</e> mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry.The key to understanding amyloid disease is the characterization of oligomeric species formed during the early stages of fibril assembly. Here we have used electrospray ionisation-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry to identify and structurally characterize the oligomers formed during amyloid assembly from beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m). Beta(2)m oligomers are shown to have collision cross-sections consistent with monomeric units arranged in elongated assemblies prior to fibril formation. Direct observation, separation, and quantification of transient oligomeric species reveals that monomers to tetramers are populated through the lag phase with no evidence for the significant population of larger oligomeric species under the conditions employed. The dynamics of each oligomeric species were monitored directly within the ensemble at concentrations commensurate with amyloid formation by observing the subunit exchange of (14)N- and (15)N-labeled oligomers. Analysis of the data revealed a decrease in oligomer dynamics concomitant with increasing oligomer size and the copopulation of dynamic dimeric and trimeric species with more stable trimeric and tetrameric species. The results presented map the events occurring during the lag phase of fibril formation and give a clear insight into the structural characteristics and dynamic nature of the beta(2)m oligomers, demonstrating the existence of elongated assemblies arising from an intact amyloidogenic protein during fibril formation.",M2

20338840,"Sodium perchlorate effects on the helical stability of a mainly alanine peptide.Sodium perchlorate salt (NaClO(4)) is commonly used as an internal intensity standard in ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy experiments. It is well known that NaClO(4) can have profound effects on peptide stability. The impact of NaClO(4) on protein stability in UVRR experiments has not yet been fully investigated. It is well known from experiment that protein stability is strongly affected by the solution composition (water, salts, osmolytes, etc.). Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to understand the physical basis on which the presence of salts and osmolytes in the solution impact protein structure and stability. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of NaClO(4), on the helical stability of an alanine peptide in water. Based upon replica-exchange molecular dynamics data, it was found that NaClO(4) solution strongly stabilizes the helical state and that the number of pure helical conformations found at room temperature is greater than in pure water. A thorough investigation of the anion effects on the first and second solvation shells of the peptide, along with the Kirkwood-Buff theory for solutions, allows us to explain the physical mechanisms involved in the observed specific <e>ion</e> effects.

20308063,"<e>Ion</e>-dependent polymerization differences between mammalian beta- and gamma-nonmuscle actin isoforms.beta- and gamma-nonmuscle actins differ by 4 amino acids at or near the N terminus and distant from polymerization interfaces. beta-Actin contains an Asp(1)-Asp(2)-Asp(3) and Val(10) whereas gamma-actin has a Glu(1)-Glu(2)-Glu(3) and Ile(10). Despite these small changes, conserved across mammals, fish, and birds, their differential localization in the same cell suggests they may play different roles reflecting differences in their biochemical properties. To test this hypothesis, we established a baculovirus-driven expression system for producing these actins in isoform-pure populations although contaminated with 20-25% insect actin. Surprisingly, Ca-gamma-actin exhibits a slower monomeric nucleotide exchange rate, a much longer nucleation phase, and a somewhat slower elongation rate than beta-actin. In the Mg-form, this difference between the two is much smaller. Ca-gamma-actin depolymerizes half as fast as does beta-actin. Mixing experiments with Ca-actins reveal the two will readily co-polymerize. In the Ca-form, phosphate release from polymerizing beta-actin occurs much more rapidly and extensively than polymerization, whereas phosphate release lags behind polymerization with gamma-actin. Phosphate release during treadmilling is twice as fast with beta- as with gamma-actin. With Mg-actin in the initial stages, phosphate release for both actins correlates much more closely with polymerization. Calcium bound in the high affinity binding site of gamma-actin may cause a selective energy barrier relative to beta-actin that retards the equilibration between G- and F-monomer conformations resulting in a slower polymerizing actin with greater filament stability. This difference may be particularly important in sites such as the gamma-actin-rich cochlear hair cell stereocilium where local mm calcium concentrations may exist.",M2
20305644,"Direct seawater desalination by <e>ion</e> concentration polarization.A shortage of fresh water is one of the acute challenges facing the world today. An energy-efficient approach to converting sea water into fresh water could be of substantial benefit, but current desalination methods require high power consumption and operating costs or large-scale infrastructures, which make them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings or in disaster scenarios. Here, we report a process for converting sea water (salinity approximately 500 mM or approximately 30,000 mg l(-1)) to fresh water (salinity &lt;10 mM or &lt;600 mg l(-1)) in which a continuous stream of sea water is divided into desalted and concentrated streams by ion concentration polarization, a phenomenon that occurs when an ion current is passed through ion-selective membranes. During operation, both salts and larger particles (cells, viruses and microorganisms) are pushed away from the membrane (a nanochannel or nanoporous membrane), which significantly reduces the possibility of membrane fouling and salt accumulation, thus avoiding two problems that plague other membrane filtration methods. To implement this approach, a simple microfluidic device was fabricated and shown to be capable of continuous desalination of sea water (approximately 99% salt rejection at 50% recovery rate) at a power consumption of less than 3.5 Wh l(-1), which is comparable to current state-of-the-art systems. Rather than competing with larger desalination plants, the method could be used to make small- or medium-scale systems, with the possibility of battery-powered operation.",M2
20305342,"The healing effect of electrolytic-reduction <e>ion</e> water on burn wounds.We prepared a lotion using electrolytic-reduction ion water (ERI), and evaluated the healing effects of this lotion (ERI lotion) on burn wounds. Third degree burn wounds were induced in the mouse dorsal skin, and ERI lotion or physiological salt (PS) lotion was applied to the wounds from immediately after injury [ERI (+) group and ERI (-) group as a control group, respectively]. The burn wound area was measured, and its serial changes were evaluated. In addition, histological examination of the burn wound site (on day 3) was performed. Comparison of the ERI (+) and (-) groups showed a significant reduction in the burn wound area in the former. Histological examination confirmed many interstitial spaces, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels in the subcutaneous tissue in the ERI (-) compared with the ERI (+) group. These results suggest the promotion of burn wound healing by ERI lotion.",M2
20305337,"The treatment effect of the burn wound healing by electrolyticreduction <e>ion</e> water lotion.A 2-year-and-4-month-old girl suffered a burn to the neck due to boiling water. She was examined at another hospital, and recommended to undergo dermatoplasty. Thirteen days after injury, she consulted our hospital. A wide skin defect was observed around the neck, and a third-degree burn was diagnosed. Conservative treatment using electrolyticreduction ion water (ERI) lotion, antibiotics/steroid combination ointment, and vitamin A/E ointment was performed without dermatoplasty. Treatment of the burn was started with the application of ERI lotion, antibiotics/steroid combination ointment, and vitamin A/E ointment to the wound 3 times a day combined with wrap therapy. The lysis of necrotic tissue and granulation began 1 week after the beginning of treatment. After 2 weeks, the necrosed skin had completely lysed, satisfactory granulation tissue began to form and blood supply improved. Regeneration of the skin was noted at 1-3 months after the beginning of treatment. Complete epithelialization was observed after 4 months, but hypertrophic cicatrization and pigmentation began to occur. After 26 months, capillary growth was observed, cicatrix became inconspicuous, pigmentation disappeared, and the burn almost completely healed. In conclusion, in this patient, the process of tissue repair after burn injury progressed smoothly, and healing was achieved without leaving hypertrophic cicatrix, keloid scar, or pigmentation. Our experience suggested that even third-degree burns can be treated using only external therapy with ERI lotion, antibiotics/steroid combination ointment, and vitamin A/E ointment without dermatoplasty.",M2
20303859,"Gadolinium <e>ions</e> block mechanosensitive channels by altering the packing and lateral pressure of anionic lipids.Effects of polyvalent ions on the lateral packing of phospholipids have been known for decades, but the physiological consequences have not been systematically studied. Gd(3+) is a relatively nonspecific agent that blocks mechano-gated channels with a variable affinity. In this study, we show that the large mechanosensitive channel MscL of Escherichia coli is effectively blocked by Gd(3+) only when reconstituted with negatively charged phospholipids (e.g., PS). Taking this lead, we studied effects of Gd(3+) on monolayers and unilamellar vesicles made of natural brain PS, DMPS, and its mixtures with DMPC. In monolayer experiments, we found that muM Gd(3+) present in the subphase leads to approximately 8% lateral compaction of brain PS (at 35 mN/m). Gd(3+) more strongly shrinks and rigidifies DMPS films causing a spontaneous liquid expanded-to-compact transition to the limiting 40 A(2)/mol. Pressure-area isotherms of uncharged DMPC were unaffected by Gd(3+), and neutralization of DMPS surface by low pH did not produce strong compaction. Upshifts of surface potential isotherms of DMPS monolayers reflected changes in the diffuse double layer due to neutralization of headgroup charges by Gd(3+), whereas the increased packing density produced up to a 200 mV change in the interfacial dipole potential. The slopes of surface potential versus reciprocal area predicted that Gd(3+) induced a modest ( approximately 18%) increase in the magnitude of the individual lipid dipoles in DMPS. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that binding of Gd(3+) to DMPS liposomes in the gel state is endothermic, whereas binding to liquid crystalline liposomes produces heat consistent with the isothermal liquid-to-gel phase transition induced by the ion. Both titration curves suggested a K(b) of approximately 10(6) M(-1). We conclude that anionic phospholipids serve as high-affinity receptors for Gd(3+) ions, and the ion-induced compaction generates a lateral pressure increase estimated as tens of mN/m. This pressure can  squeeze  the channel and shift the equilibrium toward the closed state.",M2

The [H(x)Nb(10)O(28)]((6-x)-), [H(x)TiNb(9)O(28)]((7-x)-), and [H(x)Ti(2)Nb(8)O(28)]((8-x)-) ions are all isostructural yet have different Brønsted properties. Rates for sites within a particular molecule in the series differ by at least approximately 10(4), but the relative reactivities of the oxygen sites rank in nearly the same relative order for all ions in the series. Within a single ion, most structural oxygens exhibit rates of isotopic exchange that vary similarly with pH, indicating that each structure responds as a whole to changes in pH. Across the series of molecules, however, the pH dependencies for isotope exchanges and dissociation are distinctly different, reflecting different contributions from proton- or base-enhanced pathways. The proton-enhanced pathway for isotope exchange dominates at most pH conditions for the [H(x)Ti(2)Nb(8)O(28)]((8-x)-) ion, but the base-enhanced pathways are increasingly important for the [H(x)TiNb(9)O(28)]((7-x)-) and [H(x)Nb(10)O(28)]((6-x)-) structures at higher pH. The local effect of Ti(IV) substitution could be assessed by comparing rates for structurally similar oxygens on each side of the [H(x)TiNb(9)O(28)]((7-x)-) ion and is surprisingly small. Interestingly, these nanometer-size structures seem to manifest the same general averaged amphoteric chemistry that is familiar for other reactions affecting oxides in water, including interface dissolution by proton- and hydroxyl-enhanced pathways.",M2

Total ion yield is only weakly dependent on pulse width, and consistent with experimental estimates.

20232674,"Sewage sludge reduction and system optimization in a catalytic ozonation process.The main objective of this study was to suggest a feasible, effective process for the reduction of sewage sludge using ozone oxidation catalysed by metal <e>ion</e>. A series of lab-scale experiments was conducted to select a suitable catalyst and its proper dose to achieve optimum sludge reduction. Using a central composite design under response surface methodology (RSM), system optimization with respect to sludge reduction and cost-effectiveness was performed by varying the independent parameters: dosages of ozone and ions. Five metal ions, Mn2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, CU2+, and Al3+1, were tested, and the manganese ion showed the highest sludge reduction, as measured by a decrease in total suspended solids. The ozone/Mn combination achieved approximately twice as much sludge reduction as the ozonation alone. Furthermore, the Mn dose of 10 mg/g-TS (total solids) resulted in the highest sludge reduction efficiency among the different doses, which ranged from 0 to 20 mg-Mn/g-TS. The predicted efficiency of sewage sludge reduction using the RSM was found to agree well with the experimental results, and the statistical analyses predicted optimum ranges for the doses of ozone and Mn ions, taking into account the overall cost for sewage sludge treatment.",M2
20225229,"High-dose proton therapy and carbon-<e>ion</e> therapy for stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical outcome of particle therapy for stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: From April 2003 to April 2007, 80 patients with stage I NSCLC were treated with proton therapy or carbon-ion therapy (57 with proton therapy and 23 with carbon-ion therapy) using 3 treatment protocols. In the first protocol, 80 gray equivalents (GyE) of proton therapy was given in 20 fractions, and the second proton therapy protocol used 60 GyE in 10 fractions. For carbon-ion therapy, 52.8 GyE was given in 4 fractions. After achieving promising preliminary results for the first protocol, the authors started to use the second proton therapy protocol to shorten the overall treatment time. Carbon-ion therapy was started in 2005, and thereafter, both proton and carbon-ion therapy plans were made for each patient, and the 1 that appeared superior was adopted. Patient age ranged from 48 to 89 years (median, 76 years). Thirty-seven patients were medically inoperable, and 43 refused surgery. Forty-two patients had T1 tumors, and 38 had T2 tumors. RESULTS: The median follow-up period for living patients was 35.5 months. For all 80 patients, the 3-year overall survival, cause-specific survival, and local control rates were 75% (IA: 74%; IB: 76%), 86% (IA: 84%; IB: 88%), and 82% (IA: 87%; IB: 77%), respectively. There were no significant differences in treatment results among the 3 protocols. Grade 3 pulmonary toxicity was observed in only 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy and carbon-ion therapy are safe and effective for stage I NSCLC. Further investigation of particle therapy for stage I NSCLC is warranted.",M2
20222705,"Aziridinium <e>ion</e> ring formation from nitrogen mustards: mechanistic insights from ab initio dynamics.Explicit solvent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study the activation of the nitrogen mustards mechlorethamine and phosphoramide mustard into the aziridinium ion intermediates known to be involved in the alkylation of DNA. The simulations predict a concerted reaction occurring by way of neighboring-group participation with the nearby nucleophilic tertiary nitrogen, in agreement with previous theoretical studies. The calculated activation free energy of 20.4 kcal/mol for mechlorethamine agrees well with the value of 22.5 kcal/mol determined from available experimental data. Furthermore, these simulations indicate a dynamic transition state characterized by pronounced changes in the local water structure within the first hydration shell. Trajectories initiated from the transition-state region toward products reveal a reaction that proceeds directly to the solvent-separated ion pair. Failure to cross the transition state was observed in a small number of trajectories where the degree of coordination with the leaving group is less favorable for reaction. Direct vibrational excitation of mechlorethamine alone is not sufficient to induce reaction, even with energies far in excess of the activation energy. The simulations suggest that reactivity is strongly dependent on the degree of coordination and orientation of water molecules within the vicinity of the leaving group. The complete mechanism involving solvent reorganization, ionization of the C-Cl bond, and internal cyclization of the aziridinium ion ring was captured from elevated temperature simulations. Rate constants for aziridinium ion ring formation from both mechlorethamine and phosphoramide mustard (the alkylating moiety of cyclophosphamide) are calculated and compared with available pharmacokinetic data.",M2

Using this system, acetylcholine and choline ions, whose ion-transfer potentials are different by only 60 mV, could be separated and determined simultaneously.

20213766,"Pneumatically assisted desorption/ionization: 1. Some thoughts on the possible ionization mechanism(s).We have observed that spraying solvent droplets on a zopiclone tablet produced MH(+) <e>ions</e> also in the absence of any electrical field and without the addition of organic acids to the sprayed solvent. The choice of a drug tablet as test bench has been done for the signal stability, higher than that observed when the drug is directly placed on a stainless steel surface. This behavior indicates that the formation of MH(+) ions is mainly due to pneumatical effects and the results are discussed with respect to those obtained by other research groups. Different mechanisms contributing to MH(+) production under these conditions are proposed and discussed. The local heating of the solvent thin layer present on the surface has been calculated and the small temperature increase (and the consequent small decrease of pK(a) value) suggests that this effect can play only a minor role. However, different solvents have been employed for studying this aspect and, quite surprisingly, the best results have been obtained with acetonitrile (ACN). Experiments performed by spraying CD(3)CN showed again the formation of MH(+) and not MD(+), and this excludes the role of ACN as protonating medium. A further thought was stimulated by the behavior observed by varying the sheath gas (N(2)) flow, showing that the MH(+) ion intensity increases by increasing the flow. Side effects related to the highest kinetic energy of the spraying droplets can be considered, but an active role of N(2) in the MH(+) formation could be taken into account, by considering the possible ionization of N(2) by collisional phenomena. The N(2)(+*) ions could undergo a charge-exchange reaction with analyte molecules leading to a short-lived odd electron ion which behaves as protonating media for neutral molecules. The above-described mechanism does not require either the presence of electrical fields nor the addition of organic acid to the sprayer solvent and can give a rationale for what was observed when only pneumatical conditions are employed.",M2
20211423,"Investigation of correction factors for non-reference conditions in <e>ion</e> chamber photon dosimetry with Monte-Carlo simulations.Current dosimetry protocols require geometrical reference conditions for the determination of absorbed dose in external radiotherapy. Whenever these geometrical conditions cannot be maintained the application of additional corrections becomes necessary, in principle. The current DIN6800-2 protocol includes a corresponding factor k(NR), but numerical values are lacking and no definite information about the magnitude of this correction is available yet. This study presents Monte-Carlo based calculations within the 6 MV-X photon field of a linear accelerator for a common used ion chamber (PTW31010) employing the EGSnrc code system. The linear accelerator model was matched to measurements, showing good agreement and is used as a realistic source. The individual perturbation correction factors as well as the resulting correction factor k(NR) were calculated as a function of depth for three field sizes, as a function of central axis distance for the largest field and within the build-up region. The behaviour of the ion chamber was further investigated for an idealized hypothetical field boundary. Within the field of the linear accelerator where charged particle equilibrium is achieved the factor k(NR) was generally below approximately 0.5%. In the build-up region a depth dependent correction of up to 2% was calculated when positioning the chamber according to DIN6800-2. Minimizing the depth dependence of the corrections in the build-up region lead to a slightly different positioning of the ion chamber as currently recommended. In regions of the hypothetical field boundary with missing charged particle equilibrium and high dose gradients, the ion chamber response changed by up to approximately 40%, caused by the comparatively large volume (0.125 cm(3)) of the investigated chamber.",M2

PB equations present good results of ionic concentration profiles around a macroion, especially for salt solutions containing monovalent ions. These equations include not only electrostatic interactions, but also dispersion potentials originated from polarizabilities of ions and proteins. This enables us to predict ion-specific properties of colloidal systems. We compared results obtained from the modified PB equation with those from MC simulations and integral equations. Phase diagrams and osmotic second virial coefficients are also presented for different salt solutions at different pH and ionic strengths, in agreement with the experimental results observed Hofmeister effects. In order to include the water structure and hydration effect, we have used an effective interaction obtained from molecular dynamics of each ion and a hydrophobic surface combined with PB equation. The method has been proved to be efficient and suitable for describing phenomena where the water structure close to the interface plays an essential role. Important thermodynamic properties related to protein aggregation, essential in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, can be obtained from the method shown here.",M2

For this purpose, an uncoated fused-silica capillary, a low conductivity background electrolyte (BGE) and a capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector (C(4)D) were employed. This detection system is highly sensitive and enables detection of inorganic as well as organic ions unlike with direct UV detection. Moreover, to be able to simultaneously analyze the cationic drug (labetalol(+)) and its anionic counter-ion (Cl(-)) in the same electrophoretic run without the need of a coated capillary, a dual-opposite end injection was performed. In this technique, the sample is hydrodynamically injected into both ends of the capillary. This method is simple and easy to perform since the different injection steps are automated by the CE software. This novel CE-C(4)D procedure with dual-opposite end injection has been successfully validated and applied for the analysis of chloride content in an adrenergic antagonist (labetalol hydrochloride).

In an effort to realize this important goal, spatially correlated confocal Raman and mass spectrometric images allow the extraction of three-dimensional information from the perennial grass, Miscanthus x giganteus. An optical microscopy-based landmark registry scheme was developed that allows samples to be transferred between laboratories at different institutions, while retaining the capability to access the same physical regions of the samples. Subsequent to higher resolution imaging via confocal Raman microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry was used to place these regions within the overall sample architecture. Excellent sample registry was evident in the highly correlated Raman and SIMS images.

For Tachiya model, both binding sites and apparent binding constants increased with the increasing of temperature, whereas for Stern-Volmer equation, the corresponding binding constants decreased as temperature increasing and the binding sites were independent of temperature. The positive sign of enthalpy change (DeltaH) and entropy change (DeltaS) suggested that hydrophobic forces played a major role in the interaction.

Gas-phase ions are produced using electrospray ionization, mass isolated and stored in the trapping mass spectrometer. The ions are subsequently irradiated with visible light from a tunable laser and dispersed fluorescence spectra are recorded simultaneously. Mass spectra are recorded after the irradiation period. This set-up allows us to track a range of possible outcomes upon photoexcitation of selected ions including fluorescence, photofragmentation and photodetachment of electrons. The experimental set-up is characterized using rhodamine 590, which is a methyl ester variant of rhodamine 6G. Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of gaseous rhodamine 590 are measured and compared with solution-phase spectra. Excitation and emission maxima for the gaseous ions are found to lie at higher energy than for the solvated rhodamine 590. In addition, the gas-phase Stokes shift is significantly smaller than the solution-phase Stokes shift. The effects of several experimental parameters on the observed fluorescence signal are investigated, including laser power, relative number of ions, q(z) trapping parameter and buffer gas pressure.

20199092,"<e>Ions</e> and hydrogen bonding in a hydrophobic environment: CCl(4).It is generally expected that ions in an aqueous ionic solution in contact with a hydrophobic phase enter the hydrophobic phase accompanied by a hydration shell. This expectation suggests that the ion mole fraction in the hydrophobic phase is less than, or at most, equal to that of water. Both gravimetric and spectroscopic evidence shows that for a model hydrophobic phase, carbon tetrachloride, this is not the case: In contact with a 1 M simple salt solution (sodium or potassium halide), the salt concentration in carbon tetrachloride ranges from 1.4 to nearly 3 times that of water. Infrared spectra of the OH stretch region support a model in which water associates with the cation, primarily as water monomers. Salts containing larger, more polarizable anions can form outer-sphere ion pairs that support water dimers, giving rise to a spectral signature at 3440 cm(-1). In CCl(4), the infrared spectral signature of the normally strongly ionized acid HCl clearly shows the presence of molecular HCl. Additionally, the presence of a Q branch for HCl indicates restricted rotational motion. The spectral and gravimetric data provide compelling evidence for ion clusters in the hydrophobic phase, which is a result that may have implications for hydrophobic matter in both biological and environmental systems.",M2

The results have showed that the spectra of DNA with heavy counterions (Rb(+) and Cs(+)) differ from the spectra of DNA with light counterions (Na(+) and K(+)). The calculated spectra of DNA with heavy counterions are characterized by intensive modes of ion-phosphate vibrations that form one united band near 115 cm(-1). Ion-phosphate modes in the spectra of DNA with light counterions are characterized by higher frequencies (near 180 cm(-1)) and much lower intensity.

20194777,"Response of an aerosol mass spectrometer to organonitrates and organosulfates and implications for atmospheric chemistry.Organonitrates (ON) are important products of gas-phase oxidation of volatile organic compounds in the troposphere; some models predict, and laboratory studies show, the formation of large, multifunctional ON with vapor pressures low enough to partition to the particle phase. Organosulfates (OS) have also been recently detected in secondary organic aerosol. Despite their potential importance, ON and OS remain a nearly unexplored aspect of atmospheric chemistry because few studies have quantified particulate ON or OS in ambient air. We report the response of a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) to aerosol ON and OS standards and mixtures. We quantify the potentially substantial underestimation of organic aerosol O/C, commonly used as a metric for aging, and N/C. Most of the ON-nitrogen appears as NO(x)+ <e>ions</e> in the AMS, which are typically dominated by inorganic nitrate. Minor organonitrogen ions are observed although their identity and intensity vary between standards.

OS manifests as separate organic and sulfate components in the AMS with minimal organosulfur fragments and little difference in fragmentation from inorganic sulfate. The low thermal stability of ON and OS likely causes similar detection difficulties for other aerosol mass spectrometers using vaporization and/or ionization techniques with similar or larger energy, which has likely led to an underappreciation of these species.",M2

The peaks of the cluster size distributions of the water and ethanol cluster ion beams of 3 atm vapor pressure were approximately at 2.4x10(3) and 1.6x10(3) molecules, respectively. The cluster size distributions of ethanol clusters were not sensitive to the variations of the acceleration voltages (V(e)) and currents (I(e)) of the electrons for ionization when the V(e) and I(e) were larger than approximately 200 V and 200 mA, respectively.",M2

20192350,"MIVOC method with temperature control.The Heavy <e>Ion</e> Medical Accelerator in Chiba at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences has been used for cancer therapy, physics, and biology experiments since 1994. Its ion sources produce carbon ion for cancer therapy. They also produce various ions (H(+)-Xe(21+)) for physics and biology experiments. Most ion species are produced from gases by an 18 GHz electron cyclotron resonance ion source. However, some of ion species is difficult to produce from stable and secure gases. Such ion species are produced by the sputtering method. However, it is necessary to reduce material consumption rate as much as possible in the case of rare and expensive stable isotopes. We have selected  metal ions from volatile compounds method  as a means to solve this problem. We tested a variety of compounds. Since each compound has a suitable temperature to obtain the optimum vapor pressure, we have developed an accurate temperature control system. We have produced ions such as (58)Fe(9+), Co(9+), Mg(5+), Ti(10+), Si(5+), and Ge(12+) with the temperature control.",M2
20192333,"Stability study of all-permanent-magnet electron cyclotron resonance <e>ion</e> source.Beam intensity fluctuation was investigated using an electron cyclotron resonance ion source of an all-permanent-magnet type under development for highly stable beam intensity. While the source achieved a stability of better than 3.2% by strict regulation of the coolant temperature change within +/-0.1 degrees C, the intensity varies strongly with intentional changes in the temperature of the plasma chamber coolant. The influence of the temperature on chamber expansion, magnetic field strength, and vacuum was measured or estimated in detail. The result shows that a slight change in vacuum and magnetic field strength has considerable influence on the intensity fluctuation.",M2

20189411,"Identification and counting of carbonyl and hydroxyl functionalities in protonated bifunctional analytes by using solution derivatization prior to mass spectrometric analysis via <e>ion</e>-molecule reactions.A mass spectrometric method has been developed for the identification of carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups, as well as for counting the functional groups, in previously unknown protonated bifunctional oxygen-containing analytes. This method utilizes solution reduction before mass spectrometric analysis to convert the carbonyl groups to hydroxyl groups. Gas-phase ion-molecule reactions of the protonated reduced analytes with neutral trimethylborate (TMB) in a FT-ICR mass spectrometer give diagnostic product ions. The reaction sequence likely involves three consecutive steps, proton abstraction from the protonated analyte by TMB, addition of the neutral analyte to the boron reagent, and elimination of a neutral methanol molecule. The number of methanol molecules eliminated upon reactions with TMB reveals the number of hydroxyl groups in the analyte. Comparison of the reactions of the original and reduced analytes reveals the presence and number of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups in the analyte.",M2
20188910,"Photocurable pH-sensitive membrane for <e>ion</e>-selective field effect transistors.H(+)-ion sensitive ISFETs with photocured polyurethane-based polymer membranes with three different neutral carrier ionophores and four different plasticizers have been studied in 0.05 M TRIS-HCl solutions and in background solutions containing 140 mM of Na(+) ions. The optimised membrane composition showing the best selectivity contains 2.2-2.5 wt.% of the ionophore (tridodecylamine), 36-41 wt.% of a plasticizer, and only 10 mol% of a lipophilic salt KTClPhB. The optimal ionophore/lipophilic salt ratio obtained in this work differs significantly from theoretically recommended for pH-sensitive ion-selective membranes. It is assumed that this is due to the participation of the ionophore (tertiary amine) and lipophilic additives (tetrachlorophenylborate anion) in additional photochemical reactions occurring during irradiation of the membrane matrix. Sensors with the optimised membrane composition showed sufficient sensor selectivity in front of sodium ions for clinical and biomedical applications and the lifetime of more than 3 months.",M2

However, their effect on porcelain restorations has not been widely examined. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ion leaching of porcelains immersed in acidic agents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-five discs (12.0 mm in diameter and 2.0 mm in thickness) were made from each of 4 types of porcelain (VITA VMK 95, Vitadur Alpha, IPS Empress Esthetic, and IPS e.max Ceram). Baseline data of elemental compositions of all storage agents were recorded. Four groups of discs (n=10) were then immersed in acidic agents (citrate buffer solution, pineapple juice, and green mango juice) and deionized water (control) at 37 degrees C for 168 hours. One group was immersed in 4% acetic acid at 80 degrees C for 168 hours. After immersion, fluids from all specimens for each acidic agent were measured for ion leaching with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. Surface characteristics of specimens were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Data were analyzed using 3-way repeated ANOVA and Tukey HSD multiple comparisons (alpha=.05). RESULTS: This study revealed that each type of porcelain had significantly leached the various ions to varying degrees after being immersed in acidic agents (P&lt;.001 for all comparisons). SEM photomicrographs showed surface destruction of all porcelains. CONCLUSIONS: Acidic agents used in this study affected elemental dissolution of the 4 types of porcelains evaluated.",M2
20184302,"<e>Ion</e> and solvent exchange processes in PGA/PAH polyelectrolyte multilayers containing ferrocyanide.We investigated ion exchange processes in poly(L-glutamic acid)/poly(allylamine)hydrochloride (PGA/PAH) polyelectrolyte multilayers containing ferrocyanide using electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection. Oxidation/reduction of the ferrocyanide caused a reversible swelling of the film. We showed that the electrochemical swelling of this multilayer system depends on the ionic properties of the contacting buffer. A model was developed to explain the influence of ionic strength, the pH value, and the charge of the counterions in the buffer on the swelling behavior, by relating the swelling of the multilayer to the exchange of counterions and water molecules between the buffer and the multilayer. Changing the salts in the buffer, while maintaining the same ionic strength, showed that the swelling of the multilayer is related to the counterions' molecular mass, hydration properties, and binding strength to PAH. The hydration efficiency of different monovalent anions follows the Hofmeister series, decreasing from kosmotropic ions to chaotropic ones. In contrast, the strong binding affinity of divalent anions causes them to diverge from the Hofmeister series and to release ferrocyanide from the multilayer.",M2
20180595,"A semisynthesis platform for investigating structure-function relationships in the N-terminal domain of the anthrax Lethal Factor.Many bacterial toxins act by covalently altering molecular targets within the cytosol of mammalian cells and therefore must transport their catalytic moieties across a membrane. The Protective-Antigen (PA) moiety of anthrax toxin forms multimeric pores that transport the two enzymatic moieties, the Lethal Factor (LF) and the Edema Factor, across the endosomal membrane to the cytosol. The homologous PA-binding domains of these enzymes contain N-terminal segments of highly charged amino acids that are believed to enter the pore and initiate N- to C-terminal translocation. Here we describe a semisynthesis platform that allows chemical control of this segment in LF(N), the PA-binding domain of LF. Semisynthetic LF(N) was prepared in milligram quantities by native chemical ligation of synthetic LF(N)(14-28)alphathioester with recombinant N29C-LF(N)(29-263) and compared with two variants containing alterations in residues 14-28 of the N-terminal region. The properties of the variants in blocking <e>ion</e> conductance through the PA pore and translocating across planar phospholipid bilayers in response to a pH gradient were consistent with current concepts of the mechanism of polypeptide translocation through the pore. The semisynthesis platform thus makes new analytical approaches available to investigate the interaction of the pore with its substrates.",M2

20178380,"Carbon dioxide addition to microbial fuel cell cathodes maintains sustainable catholyte pH and improves anolyte pH, alkalinity, and conductivity.Bioelectrochemical system (BES) pH imbalances develop due to anodic proton-generating oxidation reactions and cathodic hydroxide-<e>ion</e>-generating reduction reactions. Until now, workers added unsustainable buffers to reduce the pH difference between the anode and cathode because the pH imbalance contributes to BES potential losses and, therefore, power losses. Here, we report that adding carbon dioxide (CO(2)) gas to the cathode, which creates a CO(2)/bicarbonate buffered catholyte system, can diminish microbial fuel cell (MFC) pH imbalances in contrast to the CO(2)/carbonate buffered catholyte system by Torres, Lee, and Rittmann [Environ. Sci. Technol. 2008, 42, 8773]. We operated an air-cathode and liquid-cathode MFC side-by-side. For the air-cathode MFC, CO(2) addition resulted in a stable catholyte film pH of 6.61 +/- 0.12 and a 152% increase in steady-state power density. By adding CO(2) to the liquid-cathode system, we sustained a steady catholyte pH (pH = 5.94 +/- 0.02) and a low pH imbalance (DeltapH = 0.65 +/- 0.18) over a 2-week period without external salt buffer addition. By migrating bicarbonate ions from the cathode to the anode (with an anion-exchange membrane), we increased the anolyte pH (DeltapH = 0.39 +/- 0.31), total alkalinity (494 +/- 6 to 582 +/- 6 as mg CaCO(3)/L), and conductivity (1.53 +/- 0.49 to 2.16 +/- 0.03 mS/cm) relative to the feed properties. We also verified with a phosphate-buffered MFC that our reaction rates were limited mainly by the reactor configuration rather than limitations due to the bicarbonate buffer.",M2
20175531,"Theoretical modeling of magnesium <e>ion</e> imprints in the Raman scattering of water.Hydration envelopes of metallic ions significantly influence their chemical properties and biological functioning. Previous computational studies, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and vibrational spectra indicated a strong affinity of the Mg(2+) cation to water. We find it interesting that, although monatomic ions do not vibrate themselves, they cause notable changes in the water Raman signal. Therefore, in this study, we used a combination of Raman spectroscopy and computer modeling to analyze the magnesium hydration shell and origin of the signal. In the measured spectra of several salts (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, MgCl(2), CaCl(2), MgBr(2), and MgI(2) water solutions), only the spectroscopic imprint of the hydrated Mg(2+) cation could clearly be identified as an exceptionally distinct peak at approximately 355 cm(-1). The assignment of this band to the Mg-O stretching motion could be confirmed on the basis of several models involving quantum chemical computations on metal/water clusters. Minor Raman spectral features could also be explained. Ab initio and Fourier transform (FT) techniques coupled with the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics were adapted to provide the spectra from dynamical trajectories. The results suggest that even in concentrated solutions magnesium preferentially forms a [Mg(H(2)O)(6)](2+) complex of a nearly octahedral symmetry; nevertheless, the Raman signal is primarily associated with the relatively strong metal-H(2)O bond. Partially covalent character of the Mg-O bond was confirmed by a natural bond orbital analysis. Computations on hydrated chlorine anion did not provide a specific signal. The FT techniques gave good spectral profiles in the high-frequency region, whereas the lowest-wavenumber vibrations were better reproduced by the cluster models. Both dynamical and cluster computational models provided a useful link between spectral shapes and specific ion-water interactions.",M2

When target molecules interact with the functionalized lumen of a nanopore, they characteristically block the ion pathway. The resulting conductance changes allow for identification of single molecules and quantification of target species in the mixture. In this review, we first overview nanopore-based sensory techniques that have been created for the detection of myriad biomedical targets, from metal ions, drug compounds, and cellular second messengers to proteins and DNA. Then we introduce our recent discoveries in nanopore single molecule detection: (1) using the protein nanopore to study folding/unfolding of the G-quadruplex aptamer; (2) creating a portable and durable biochip that is integrated with a single-protein pore sensor (this chip is compared with recently developed protein pore sensors based on stabilized bilayers on glass nanopore membranes and droplet interface bilayer); and (3) creating a glass nanopore-terminated probe for single-molecule DNA detection, chiral enantiomer discrimination, and identification of the bioterrorist agent ricin with an aptamer-encoded nanopore.",M2
20173314,"Comparison of DNA breaks at entrance channel and Bragg peak induced by fast C6+ <e>ions</e>--influence of the addition of platinum atoms on DNA.When energetic carbon ion beam (GeV range) goes through the matter, inelastic processes such as electronic ionization, molecular and nuclear fragmentation occur. For carbontherapy (hadrontherapy) purpose, it is of interest to compare the number of DNA breaks -single SSB or double DSB- for a given dose at the entrance channel and at the Bragg peak to look for a possible differential effect in the number of DNA breaks induced at these two locations. Samples of free plasmids DNA and complexes of plasmids DNA added with molecules containing platinum have been placed at different locations of an experimental setup simulating penetration depths of the ion beam in water and irradiated by carbon ions 290 MeV/amu. The DNA breaks have been quantified by subsequent electrophoresis on agarose gels. To disentangle the respective role of the direct and indirect effect, a free radical scavenger of hydroxyl radicals HO degree-dimethylsulfoxide DMSO- has been added in some of the experiments. In the range of Linear Energy Transfer-LET 13 - 110 keV/microm-, the number of the DSB was found to be constant versus the LET for a given dose. Contrary, the number of the SSB decreases at the Bragg peak compared to the entrance channel. In the presence of platinum, the number of single and double breaks was considerably enhanced, and follows a similar behaviour than in the free-DNA experiments. Quantitative results on DNA damages do not show significant enhancement due to the nuclear or to the molecular fragmentation in the present experiments.",M2
20173242,"The preparation of an elastomer/silicate layer nanocompound with an exfoliated structure and a strong ionic interfacial interaction by utilizing an elastomer latex containing pyridine groups.A great variety of polymer/layered silicate (PLS) nanocomposites have been reported, however, there are few exfoliated PLS nanocomposites and their inorganic-organic interfaces are still a great problem, especially for the elastomers. In this research, a kind of exfoliated elastomer/silicate layer nanocompound was prepared and proved by XRD and TEM, in which 10 phr Na(+)-montmorillonite was dispersed in butadiene-styrene-vinyl pyridine rubber by latex compounding method with acidic flocculants. Moreover, a dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer (DMTA) suggested a strong interfacial interaction (interaction parameter B(H) = 4.91) between the silicate layers and macromolecules in addition to the weak inorganic-organic interfacial interaction, and solid state (15)N NMR indicated the formation of a strong ionic interface through the acidifying pyridine.

20170966,"Metal <e>ion</e>-N7 coordination in a ribozyme branch domain by NMR.The N7 of purine nucleotides presents one of the most dominant metal ion binding sites in nucleic acids. However, the interactions between kinetically labile metal ions like Mg(2+) and these nitrogen atoms are inherently difficult to observe in large RNAs. Rather than using the insensitive direct (15)N detection, here we have used (2)J-[(1)H,(15)N]-HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) NMR experiments as a fast and efficient method to specifically observe and characterize such interactions within larger RNA constructs. Using the 27 nucleotides long branch domain of the yeast-mitochondrial group II intron ribozyme Sc.ai5gamma as an example, we show that direct N7 coordination of a Mg(2+) ion takes place in a tetraloop nucleotide. A second Mg(2+) ion, located in the major groove at the catalytic branch site, coordinates mainly in an outer-sphere fashion to the highly conserved flanking GU wobble pairs but not to N7 of the sandwiched branch adenosine.",M2
20170952,"The effects of strontium-substituted bioactive glasses on osteoblasts and osteoclasts in vitro.Bioactive glasses (BG) which contain strontium have the potential to combine the known bone regenerative properties of BG with the anabolic and anti-catabolic effects of strontium cations. Here we created a BG series (SiO(2)-P(2)O(5)-Na(2)O-CaO) in which 0-100% of the calcium was substituted by strontium and tested their effects on osteoblasts and osteoclasts in vitro. We show that <e>ions</e> released from strontium-substituted BG enhance metabolic activity in osteoblasts. They also inhibit osteoclast activity by both reducing tartrate resistant acid phosphatase activity and inhibiting resorption of calcium phosphate films in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, osteoblasts cultured in contact with BG show increased proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity with increasing strontium substitution, while osteoclasts adopt typical resorption morphologies. These results suggest that similarly to the osteoporosis drug strontium ranelate, strontium-substituted BG may promote an anabolic effect on osteoblasts and an anti-catabolic effect on osteoclasts. These effects, when combined with the advantages of BG such as controlled ion release and delivery versatility, may make strontium-substituted BG an effective biomaterial choice for a range of bone regeneration therapies.",M2
20163175,"Effects of lability of metal complex on free <e>ion</e> measurement using DMT.Very low concentrations of free metal ion in natural samples can be measured using the Donnan membrane technique (DMT) based on ion transport kinetics. In this paper, the possible effects of slow dissociation of metal complexes on the interpretation of kinetic DMT are investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The expressions of the lability parameter, Lgrangian , were derived for DMT. Analysis of new experimental studies using synthetic solution containing NTA as the ligand and Cu(2+) ions shows that when the ionic strength is low (&lt;or=0.2 mM Ca(NO(3))(2)) the dissociation rate of NTACu becomes the limiting step in Cu transport of the DMT measurement. In natural waters, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the most important source of ligands that complex metals. By comparing the fraction of labile species measured using other dynamic sensors (DGT, GIME) in several freshwaters, it is concluded that in most waters ion transport in DMT is controlled by diffusion in the membrane. Only in very soft waters (&lt;0.7 mM Ca+Mg), the dissociation rate of natural metal complex may influence ion transport in DMT. In this case, neglecting this effect may lead to an underestimation of the free metal ion concentration measured.",M2

Control ES-MS experiments performed on solutions containing calcium chloride or calcium acetate and a pair of proteins that do not bind calcium ions in solution revealed that the nonspecific association of metal ions to proteins during ES is a random process, independent of protein size and structure. These results establish the reliability of the reference protein method for quantitatively correcting ES mass spectra for the occurrence of nonspecific metal ion binding to proteins during ES-MS analysis. To demonstrate the utility of the direct ES-MS assay, when carried out using the reference protein method, the calcium binding stoichiometry of bovine alpha-lactalbumin and the calcium ion affinity of bovine beta-lactoglobulin were established.",M2
20150519,"<e>Ion</e> fluxes across the pitcher walls of three Bornean Nepenthes pitcher plant species: flux rates and gland distribution patterns reflect nitrogen sequestration strategies.Nepenthes pitcher plant species differ in their prey capture strategies, prey capture rates, and pitcher longevity. In this study, it is investigated whether or not interspecific differences in nutrient sequestration strategy are reflected in the physiology and microstructure of the pitchers themselves. Using a non-invasive technique (MIFE), ion fluxes in pitchers of Nepenthes ampullaria Jack, Nepenthes bicalcarata Hook.f., and Nepenthes rafflesiana Jack were measured. Scanning electron microscopy was also used to characterize the distribution of glandular and other structures on the inner pitcher walls. The results demonstrate that nutrient sequestration strategy is indeed mirrored in pitcher physiology and microstructure. Species producing long-lived pitchers with low prey capture rates (N. ampullaria, N. bicalcarata) showed lower rates of NH(4)(+) uptake than N. rafflesiana, a species producing short-lived pitchers with high capture rates. Crucially, species dependent upon aquatic commensals (N. ampullaria, N. bicalcarata) actively manipulated H(+) fluxes to maintain less acid pitcher fluid than found in 'typical' species; in addition, these species lacked the lunate cells and epicuticular waxes characteristic of 'typical' insectivorous congeners. An unexpected finding was that ion fluxes occurred in the wax-covered, non-glandular zones in N. rafflesiana. The only candidates for active transport of aqueous ions in these zones appear to be the epidermal cells lying beneath the lunate cells, as these are the only sites not visibly coated with epicuticular waxes.",M2
20146515,"<e>Ion</e> selectivity of alpha-hemolysin with beta-cyclodextrin adapter. II. Multi-ion effects studied with grand canonical Monte Carlo/Brownian dynamics simulations.In a previous study of ion selectivity of alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) in complex with beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD) adapter, we calculated the potential of mean force (PMF) and characterized the self-diffusion coefficients of isolated K(+) and Cl(-) ions using molecular dynamics simulations (Y. Luo et al.,  Ion Selectivity of alpha-Hemolysin with beta-Cyclodextrin Adapter: I. Single Ion Potential of Mean Force and Diffusion Coefficient ). In the present effort, these results pertaining to single isolated ions in the wide aqueous pore are extended to take into account multi-ion effects. The grand canonical Monte Carlo/Brownian dynamics (GCMC/BD) algorithm is used to simulate ion currents through the wild-type alphaHL ion channel, as well as two engineered alphaHL mutants, with and without the cyclic oligosaccaride betaCD lodged in the lumen of the pore. The GCMC/BD current-voltage curves agree well with experimental results and show that betaCD increases the anion selectivity of alphaHL. Comparisons between multi-ion PMFs from GCMC/BD simulations and single-ion PMFs demonstrate that multi-ion effects and pore shape are crucial for explaining this behavior. It is concluded that the narrow betaCD adapter increases the anion selectivity of alphaHL because it reduces the pore radius locally, which decreases the ionic screening and the dielectric shielding of the strong electrostatic field induced by a nearby ring of positively charged alphaHL side chains.",M2
20146471,"Study of <e>ion</e>-paired iridium complexes (soft salts) and their application in organic light emitting diodes.Three Ir-based materials were synthesized through metathesis reaction between halide and alkali metal salts of two cationic and three anionic Ir complexes, respectively. The resulting  soft salt  complexes are composed of an organometallic cation and an organometallic anion. The electrochemical and photophysical characterization of these compounds is reported. The redox potentials of the soft salts are shown to be determined by the lowest energy potentials of the two ions. Energy transfer between the ions in solution is observed, and found to take place at diffusion controlled rates. Organic LEDs were prepared with each of the three soft salts, using the simple structure of anode/PVK/soft salt/BCP/cathode. The soft salts yielded maximal external quantum efficiencies (EQE) ranging from 0.2% to 4.7%. The study suggests that the internal energy alignment between two ions in the soft salts is responsible for the widely disparate results. To achieve a high EQE, it is critical to have the HOMO and LUMO values of one of the ions fall between those of the other ion, that is, one ion has both the lowest oxidation potential and the least negative reduction potential.",M2
20146274,"Elucidation of metal-<e>ion</e> accumulation induced by hydrogen bonds on protein surfaces by using porous lysozyme crystals containing Rh(III) ions as the model surfaces.Metal-ion accumulation on protein surfaces is a crucial step in the initiation of small-metal clusters and the formation of inorganic materials in nature. This event is expected to control the nucleation, growth, and position of the materials. There remain many unknowns, as to how proteins affect the initial process at the atomic level, although multistep assembly processes of the materials formation by both native and model systems have been clarified at the macroscopic level. Herein the cooperative effects of amino acids and hydrogen bonds promoting metal accumulation reactions are clarified by using porous hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) crystals containing Rh(III) ions, as model protein surfaces for the reactions. The experimental results reveal noteworthy implications for initiation of metal accumulation, which involve highly cooperative dynamics of amino acids and hydrogen bonds: i) Disruption of hydrogen bonds can induce conformational changes of amino-acid residues to capture Rh(III) ions. ii) Water molecules pre-organized by hydrogen bonds can stabilize Rh(III) coordination as aqua ligands. iii) Water molecules participating in hydrogen bonds with amino-acid residues can be replaced by Rh(III) ions to form polynuclear structures with the residues. iv) Rh(III) aqua complexes are retained on amino-acid residues through stabilizing hydrogen bonds even at low pH (approximately 2). These metal-protein interactions including hydrogen bonds may promote native metal accumulation reactions and also may be useful in the preparation of new inorganic materials that incorporate proteins.",M2
20153894,"Extended delivery of hydrophilic drugs from silicone-hydrogel contact lenses containing vitamin E diffusion barriers.This paper proposes an approach for increasing drug release durations from contact lenses and other biomedical devices by in situ creation of transport barriers of Vitamin E that force drug molecules to diffuse through long tortuous path. Results show that the increase in release duration is quadratic in Vitamin E loading, which is consistent with proposed mathematical models. Loadings of 10 and 40% Vitamin E increase release time of timolol by a factor of about 5 and 400, respectively for NIGHT&amp;DAY lens. Similar results have been obtained for other hydrophilic drugs including fluconazole and dexamethasone 21-disodium phosphate (DXP). Vitamin E loading in the NIGHT&amp;DAY lens leads to slight increase in lens sizes (6.5% increase for 30% loading), a slight reduction in oxygen diffusion (about 40% reduction for 75% loading), and a more significant reduction in the <e>ion</e> permeability (50% reduction for 10% loading).

The key advantage of FAIMS is substantial orthogonality to mass spectrometry (MS), which makes FAIMS/MS hybrid a powerful analytical platform of broad utility. However, the potential of FAIMS has been constrained by limited resolution. Here, we report that the use of gas mixtures comprising up to 75% He dramatically increases the FAIMS separation capability, with the resolving power for peptides and peak capacity for protein digests reaching and exceeding 100. The resolution gains extend to small molecules, where previously unresolved isomers can now be separated. These performance levels open major new applications of FAIMS in proteomic and other biomolecular analyses.",M2
