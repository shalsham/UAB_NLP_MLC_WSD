20507003,"Congenital pupillary-<e>iris</e>-lens membrane with goniodysgenesis: histopathologic findings in an enucleated eye.A 10-year-old boy with clinically confirmed congenital pupillary-iris-lens membrane with goniodysgenesis underwent light microscopic examination of the enucleated eye. The anterior segment changes consisted of the absence of the iridial pupillary sphincter muscle and dilator muscle processes. Endothelialization and descemetization of the anterior chamber angle and the anterior surface of the iris covered the original eccentric pupillary opening (occlusio pupillae), but grew around the fibrotic edges of the surgically created, patent pseudopupil, probably secondary responses to surgery. The anterior chamber findings in this case establish a localized syndrome that includes absence of the pupillary sphincter and dilator muscle processes. Incomplete development of the iris may be partly attributable to an abnormality of stromal development and inductions by the anterior neuroectodermal layer, together with anomalies of the pupillo-iridial vasculature.",M1

20457369,"Objective analysis of toric intraocular lens rotation and centration.PURPOSE: To assess the repeatability of an objective image-analysis technique to determine intraocular lens (IOL) rotation and centration. SETTING: Six European ophthalmology clinics. METHODS: Eyes with an Akreos AO aspheric IOL with orientation marks were imaged. A masked observer rated image quality. The axis of rotation was determined from a line bisecting the IOL orientation marks. This was normalized for rotation of the eye between visits using the axis bisecting 2 consistent conjunctival vessels or <e>iris</e> features. The center of ovals overlaid to circumscribe the IOL optic edge and the pupil or limbus were compared to determine IOL centration. Intrasession repeatability was assessed in a subgroup of eyes and the variability of repeated analysis examined. RESULTS: The SD of intrasession repeatability was +/-0.79 degrees for IOL rotational stability, +/-0.10 mm for horizontal centration, and +/-0.10 mm for vertical centration. The SD of repeated-analysis variability of the same image was +/-0.70 degrees, +/-0.20 mm, and +/-0.31 mm, respectively. The mean eye rotation (absolute) between visits was 2.23 degrees +/- 1.84 (SD) (10% &gt;5 degrees rotation) using 1 set of consistent conjunctival vessels or iris features and 2.03 +/- 1.66 degrees (7%&gt;5 degrees rotation) using the mean of 2 sets (P = .13). Poorer image quality resulted in larger apparent absolute IOL rotation (r = -0.45, P&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: Objective analysis of digital retroillumination images allowed sensitive assessment of IOL rotation and centration stability. Eye rotation between images can lead to significant errors if not taken into account. Image quality is important to analysis accuracy.",M1
20431134,"The multiscenario multienvironment BioSecure Multimodal Database (BMDB).A new multimodal biometric database designed and acquired within the framework of the European BioSecure Network of Excellence is presented. It is comprised of more than 600 individuals acquired simultaneously in three scenarios: 1) over the Internet, 2) in an office environment with desktop PC, and 3) in indoor/outdoor environments with mobile portable hardware. The three scenarios include a common part of audio/video data. Also, signature and fingerprint data have been acquired both with desktop PC and mobile portable hardware. Additionally, hand and <e>iris</e> data were acquired in the second scenario using desktop PC. Acquisition has been conducted by 11 European institutions. Additional features of the BioSecure Multimodal Database (BMDB) are: two acquisition sessions, several sensors in certain modalities, balanced gender and age distributions, multimodal realistic scenarios with simple and quick tasks per modality, cross-European diversity, availability of demographic data, and compatibility with other multimodal databases. The novel acquisition conditions of the BMDB allow us to perform new challenging research and evaluation of either monomodal or multimodal biometric systems, as in the recent BioSecure Multimodal Evaluation campaign. A description of this campaign including baseline results of individual modalities from the new database is also given. The database is expected to be available for research purposes through the BioSecure Association during 2008.",M1
20414131,"Pupillary dysfunction in an atypical case of mitochondrial myopathy with tubular aggregates.A 62-year-old man presented with diplopia, ocular ductional deficits, and sluggish pupils. Pupillometry demonstrated large hyporeactive pupils with no evidence of damage to the sympathetic or parasympathetic innervation, indicating a myopathy of the <e>iris</e> musculature. A single large deletion in mitochondrial DNA and characteristic histochemical features on muscle biopsy suggested a mitochondrial cytopathy. However, ultrastructural examination of skeletal muscle fibers showed tubular aggregates (TAs), a finding not reported in mitochondrial cytopathy. The combination of pupillary abnormalities and TAs suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction may not explain the full extent of abnormalities in this case.",M1
20362865,"<e>Iris</e>-fixated phakic intraocular lens implantation for correction of high myopia in microspherophakia.We report the refractive correction of high myopia in a 23-year-old patient with idiopathic microspherophakia using iris-fixated phakic intraocular lenses (pIOLs) (Verisyse/Artisan). Four years after bilateral implantation, the uncorrected distance visual acuity was 20/25 with a correction of 20/20(-1) in both eyes. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. Iris-fixated pIOLs are not recommended for every patient with microspherophakia. However, this procedure may be an option in microspherophakic patients with appropriate anterior chamber depth and no history of lens dislocation who are likely to comply with annual eye examinations. Follow-up should include monitoring the endothelial cell count and biomicroscopy for adequate space between the pIOL, the natural crystalline lens, and the corneal endothelium. Scheimpflug photography can be a valuable tool in such cases.",M1

During lag period, depigmentation (dedifferentiation) occurred in many cells. When culture became confluent 3-4 weeks after seeding tiny lens like structures differentiated from foci of cultured pigmented iris epithelium cells.

20357839,"Point spread function engineering for <e>iris</e> recognition system design.Undersampling in the detector array degrades the performance of iris-recognition imaging systems. We find that an undersampling of 8 x 8 reduces the iris-recognition performance by nearly a factor of 4 (on CASIA iris database), as measured by the false rejection ratio (FRR) metric. We employ optical point spread function (PSF) engineering via a Zernike phase mask in conjunction with multiple subpixel shifted image measurements (frames) to mitigate the effect of undersampling. A task-specific optimization framework is used to engineer the optical PSF and optimize the postprocessing parameters to minimize the FRR. The optimized Zernike phase enhanced lens (ZPEL) imager design with one frame yields an improvement of nearly 33% relative to a thin observation module by bounded optics (TOMBO) imager with one frame. With four frames the optimized ZPEL imager achieves a FRR equal to that of the conventional imager without undersampling. Further, the ZPEL imager design using 16 frames yields a FRR that is actually 15% lower than that obtained with the conventional imager without undersampling.",M1
20225783,"Clinical outcome of iridotomy with Argon-YAG laser at a tertiary care center in Karachi, Pakistan.OBJECTIVE: To assess the the efficacy and early and late complications of Argon-YAG combined laser iridotomy in the outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, Pakistan. After detailed history taking and clinical examination, patients who had goniscopically evident closed angles and a positive provocative test were selected for laser iridotomy. They underwent iridotomy using Argon laser followed by YAG laser. The main outcome measures were patency of iridotomy at 6 months, angle grading at 6 months and early and late complications. RESULTS: Overall 40 eyes of 30 patients underwent iridotomy. Of these 18 (60%) were female. At presentation, 26, 10, 2 and 2 eyes had primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), prodromal stage of PACG, chronic angle closure glaucoma, and seculusio papillae with <e>iris</e> bombe secondary to uveitis, respectively. All the 40 iridotomies were patent at 6 months follow up. Majority of the eyes with primary acute angle closure glaucoma, and prodromal angle closure glaucoma had their angles opened from Grade 0 and Grade I to Grade III. At 6 months, 30 (75%) eyes had a good control of intraocular pressure (lOP). Intraoperative complication, encountered were microhyphaema in 14 eyes and 2 developed corneal burns. Postoperative complications were transient rise of IOP in 18 eyes and post-laser iritis in 32 eyes, but they responded to recommended treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Iridotomy with Argon laser followed by Nd-YAG laser was associated with good clinical outcome and fewer complications in eyes with PACG.",M1
20202541,"Manual limbal markings versus <e>iris</e>-registration software for correction of myopic astigmatism by laser in situ keratomileusis.PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of manual limbal markings and wavefront-guided treatment with iris-registration software in laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for myopic astigmatism. SETTING: National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. METHODS: Eyes with myopic astigmatism had LASIK with a Technolas 217z laser. Eyes in the limbal-marking group had conventional LASIK (PlanoScan or Zyoptix tissue-saving algorithm) with manual cyclotorsional-error adjustments according to 2 limbal marks. Eyes in the iris-registration group had wavefront-guided ablation (Zyoptix) in which cyclotorsional errors were automatically detected and adjusted. Refraction, corneal topography, and visual acuity data were compared between groups. Vector analysis was by the Alpins method. RESULTS: The mean preoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was -6.64 diopters (D) +/- 1.99 (SD) in the limbal-marking group and -6.72 +/- 1.86 D in the iris-registration group (P = .92). At 6 months, the mean SE was -0.42 +/- 0.63 D and -0.47 +/- 0.62 D, respectively (P = .08). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in the astigmatism correction, success, or flattening index values using 6-month postoperative refractive data. The angle of error was within +/-10 degrees in 73% of eyes in the limbal-marking group and 75% of eyes in the iris-registration group. CONCLUSION: Manual limbal markings and iris-registration software were equally effective and safe in LASIK for myopic astigmatism, showing that checking cyclotorsion by manual limbal markings is a safe alternative when automated systems are not available.",M1
20181410,"[Comparison of optical coherence tomography and ultrasound biomicroscopy for detection of plateau <e>iris</e>]PURPOSE: To compare optical coherence tomography (OCT) and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) for detection of plateau iris configuration and confirmation of plateau iris syndrome. PARTICIPANTS: Three subjects with plateau iris configuration were recruited. All patients underwent gonioscopy, UBM, and OCT. METHODS: The anterior chamber angle in each patient was imaged with a commercially available OCT unit. The angle configurations were assessed and compared with the UBM images. RESULTS: Both OCT and UBM showed excellent performance in identifying eyes with plateau iris. The UBM confirmed the plateau iris diagnosis by showing the iris root indentation caused by the ciliary body. The OCT, which is a rapid, non-contact exam, and non-operator-dependent, can only show indirect signs, because it cannot detect structures behind the iris. Nevertheless, the indirect signs with OCT were accurate enough to make the diagnosis. The OCT also shows the angle closure risk in a sitting patient, and is therefore more physiologic than the UBM exam, for which the patient is supine. OCT can directly show a patent laser iridotomy and confirm its efficacy. The OCT can detect indirect signs of plateau iris syndrome after iridotomy. CONCLUSION: The OCT unit can be practically employed to confirm a clinical suspicion of plateau iris configuration and syndrome.",M1
20157414,"A case of ciliary body melanocytoma presenting as a painful <e>iris</e> mass.We report a case of ciliary body melanocytoma in a Korean patient, which presented as an intermittently painful pigmented iris mass and was successfully managed by iridocyclectomy. A 52-year-old healthy man presented with an irregularly-shaped and heavily-pigmented mass at the iris root of his right eye. Visual acuity of the right eye was 20/20 with normal intraocular pressure. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a 1.5x1.3-mm ciliary-body mass with extension into the iris root. Iridocyclectomy with scleral resection under a lamellar scleral flap was performed, and the histopathologic features of the resected tissue were consistent with melanocytoma of the ciliary body. The patient's visual acuity remained 20/20 with good postoperative cosmesis. During one year of follow-up, no signs of tumor recurrence were seen, and the patient reported resolution of the intermittent ocular pain in the involved eye.",M1
20152928,"Reactive oxygen species promote localized DNA damage in glaucoma-<e>iris</e> tissues of elderly patients vulnerable to diabetic injury.Glaucoma is typically an insidious-onset disease with serious visual consequences that has been positively linked to diabetes mellitus (DM). Glaucoma is more often present in the elderly. Important prognostic factors of glaucoma may be oxidative stress resulting from the toxic effects of glucose, and diabetes-associated vascular complications. Fifty-five patients and control subjects aged 71.0+/-10.1 yrs were enrolled in this study. Iris-tissue samples from DM type-2 patients, primary open-angle glaucoma-positive and -negative DM patients, and from healthy subjects were examined by use of the alkaline comet assay. We measured the DNA damage as numbers of strand breaks (SBs), oxidized purines as glycosyl-formamido-glycosylase (Fpg)-susceptible sites, and oxidized pyrimidines as endonuclease III (Nth)-susceptible sites. It was found that the level of oxidative damage in iris tissue was statistically higher in DM and glaucoma patients than that in healthy controls (oxidized purines: 38.0% and 34.7% vs 15.4%; oxidized pyrimidines: 43.3% and 39.0% vs 23.3%; P&lt;0.001). Interestingly, we found strongly elevated levels of oxidized purines and pyrimidines in glaucomatous patients who also had DM, in comparison with healthy controls (oxidized purines: 55.7% vs 15.4%; oxidized pyrimidines: 61.8% vs 23.3%; P&lt;0.001). Our observations suggest that the generation of reactive oxygen species may promote localized DNA damage in glaucoma-iris tissues of elderly patients vulnerable to diabetic injury.",M1

20148654,"Adjunctive intravitreal bevacizumab-combined trabeculectomy versus trabeculectomy alone in the treatment of neovascular glaucoma.PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of adjunctive intravitreal bevacizumab (ivBe) with trabeculectomy versus trabeculectomy alone in the management of patients with neovascular glaucoma (NVG). METHODS: Retrospective, consecutive, interventional case series. NVG patients were divided into groups by treatment: with adjunctive ivBe and trabeculectomy (ivBe group, n = 14 eyes) and with trabeculectomy only (control group, n = 28 eyes). The main outcome measure was visual acuity. Regression of <e>iris</e> neovascularization (NVI), change(s) in intraocular pressure (IOP), NVI recurrence, additional glaucoma surgeries required, eyes of leading to total blindness, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and number of topical medications required after trabeculectomy were regarded as second outcome measures. In the ivBe group, intravitreal injections of 2.5 mg bevacizumab were delivered using a sharp 27-gauge needle through the inferotemporal quadrant. RESULTS: Of 42 eyes of 42 patients identified, change in IOP, additional glaucoma surgeries required, and number of IOP-lowering topical medications required after trabeculectomy did not differ significantly between groups (P &gt; 0.05 for all). However, the ivBe group had significantly higher frequency and rapidity of iris neovascular regression, improved visual acuity in the logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), leading to total blindness in fewer eyes and intraoperative and postoperative complications in others than in the control group (P = 0.015, 0.002, 0.007, 0.023, and 0.008, respectively). The follow-up duration (mean +/- SD) from trabeculectomy surgery was 179 +/- 97 days (range, 93-315 days) and 196 +/- 108 days (range, 92-370 days) in the ivBe and control group (P = 0.324). CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal bevacizumab might be a useful adjunctive therapy in addition to trabeculectomy in the management of NVG. Large controlled randomized studies for treatment of bevacizumab on NVG are warranted.",M1
20139289,"Z-suture: a new knotless technique for transscleral suture fixation of intraocular implants.The presented Z-suture is a simple, rapid and safe knotless technique that facilitates transscleral suture fixation of various intraocular implants in the ciliary sulcus, such as sutured intraocular lenses, artificial <e>iris</e> prostheses and iris diaphragms. As the knotless approach reliably avoids suture erosion, external fixation can be performed without any protecting scleral flaps or lamellar grooves. The needle is simply passed through the sulcus and the emerging polypropylene suture is secured in the sclera using a zigzag-shaped intrascleral suture (Z-suture). Each pass starts directly adjacent to the exiting site. Five passes are sufficient to reliably fix the suture so that it resists even maximum tractive forces. Once this procedure is done, the suture can be cut without any knot. By avoiding suture knots, and hence the need for intrascleral flaps, this knotless approach may help to reduce suture-related complications such as scleral atrophy, suture erosion and infections.",M1

20126500,"Intraoperative floppy <e>iris</e> syndrome: pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment.PURPOSE: To extend upon previous reports, observations, and discussions of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) with the goal of providing new insight into the syndrome's pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment. METHODS: Following a review of IFIS and its relationship to autonomic pharmacology, evidence for anatomic changes following exposure of humans and other animals to autonomic drugs is described. The clinical implications for these findings are discussed as they relate to the treatment and prevention of this syndrome. RESULTS: IFIS has been associated with the use of adrenergic antagonists even after they have been discontinued years prior to surgery. Some investigators believe that this persistence of IFIS reflects anatomic structural change. Evidence from laboratory experiments and human clinical studies using topically applied and systemic autonomic drugs supports the possibility of anatomic changes coexisting with IFIS observed during cataract surgery. CONCLUSIONS: IFIS is a relatively rare syndrome, often associated with the use of systemic alpha-blockers and conditions that influence dilator muscle tone. Laboratory and clinical evidence supports the possibility of anatomic changes following the use of autonomic drugs. The persistence of IFIS years after cessation of treatment with alpha-blockers suggests that the potential risks of discontinuing these drugs prior to cataract surgery outweigh potential benefits.",M1

The purpose of this research is to obtain sequence resources for a newt lens regeneration study and to obtain insights of dedifferentiation at the molecular level. METHODS: mRNA was purified from iris during dedifferentiation and its cDNA library was constructed. From the cDNA library 10,449 clones were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: From 10,449 reads, 780 contigs and 1,666 singlets were annotated. The presence of several cancer- and apoptosis-related genes during newt dedifferentiation was revealed. Moreover, several candidate genes, which might participate in reprogramming during dedifferentiation, were also found. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of cancer- and apoptosis-related genes could be hallmarks during dedifferentiation. The expression sequence tag (EST) resource is useful for the future study of newt dedifferentiation, and the sequence information is available in GenBank (accession numbers; FS290155-FS300559).",M1
20083454,"An analysis of IrisCode.IrisCode is an <e>iris</e> recognition algorithm developed in 1993 and continuously improved by Daugman. It has been extensively applied in commercial iris recognition systems. IrisCode representing an iris based on coarse phase has a number of properties including rapid matching, binomial impostor distribution and a predictable false acceptance rate. Because of its successful applications and these properties, many similar coding methods have been developed for iris and palmprint identification. However, we lack a detailed analysis of IrisCode. The aim of this paper is to provide such an analysis as a way of better understanding IrisCode, extending the coarse phase representation to a precise phase representation, and uncovering the relationship between IrisCode and other coding methods. Our analysis demonstrates that IrisCode is a clustering algorithm with four prototypes; the locus of a Gabor function is a 2-D ellipse with respect to a phase parameter and can be approximated by a circle in many cases; Gabor function can be considered as a phase-steerable filter and the bitwise hamming distance can be regarded as a bitwise phase distance. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of the impostor binomial distribution. We use this analysis to develop a precise phase representation which can enhance accuracy. Finally, we relate IrisCode and other coding methods.",M1

Further, another known benzene derivative, isopenol (2), also afforded two known isoflavones, irisolone (3) and irisolidone (4). The structure of the new compound was determined on the basis of spectroscopic data, including 2D-NMR experiments, while the known compounds were identified on the basis of their spectral data and existing literature evidence. The comparison of the spectral data of the irisolidone (3) with that reported for the molecule led us to revise some of the reported 1H-NMR chemical shift assignments.",M1
20075454,"The biometric menagerie.It is commonly accepted that users of a biometric system may have differing degrees of accuracy within the system. Some people may have trouble authenticating, while others may be particularly vulnerable to impersonation. Goats, wolves, and lambs are labels commonly applied to these problem users. These user types are defined in terms of verification performance when users are matched against themselves (goats) or when matched against others (lambs and wolves). The relationship between a user's genuine and impostor match results suggests four new user groups: worms, doves, chameleons, and phantoms. We establish formal definitions for these animals and a statistical test for their existence. A thorough investigation is conducted using a broad range of biometric modalities, including 2D and 3D faces, fingerprints, <e>iris</e>, speech, and keystroke dynamics. Patterns that emerge from the results expose novel, important, and encouraging insights into the nature of biometric match results.

20065227,"Use of a microvascular clip for <e>iris</e> fixation of an intraocular lens: a laboratory model.Here we present a potential novel surgical technique consisting of fixation of a posterior-chamber intraocular lens to the iris that may be used in the treatment of aphakia or the management of intraocular lens complications when capsular support has been compromised. The technique was performed in a laboratory model using cadaveric human eyes. A commercially available neurovascular clip was used to securely fasten the intraocular lens to the iris with minimal trauma. The use of a metal clip has the advantage of avoiding potential risks of suture fixation such as suture breakage. Also, this technique is easier than suturing and may potentially serve as another tool in a cornea surgeon's armamentarium.",M1
20046692,"A study of the vascular network of the <e>iris</e> using flat preparation.PURPOSE: This study was performed to examine the vascular network of the human iris using flat preparation. METHODS: The ciliary body-iris structures were separated from human eyeballs, and a portion of the irises were treated with trypsin to remove the pigment granules. These iris tissues were unfolded and placed onto glass slides using flat preparation, and the vascular network of each iris was examined by fluorescein microscopy. The ciliary body-iris structures separated from the remaining eyes were stained with hematoxylin-eosin without trypsin treatment and were examined by light microscopy. RESULTS: The long posterior ciliary artery formed several branches before entering the iris root, and such branches formed the major arterial circle of the iris with diverse diameters in the vicinity of the iris root and the ciliary process. In the pupillary margin, the iris vasculature network formed a cone shape and then formed an arcade by connecting to adjacent vasculatures. In the vicinity of the collarette, the iris vasculature network formed the minor arterial circle of the iris with diverse diameters perpendicular to the arcade of the iris network located in the pupillary margin. In the pupillary margin, the capillaries were somewhat thick and connected to the irregular traveling iris vein. CONCLUSIONS: The above findings explain the human iris vascular network and provide a theoretical basis for the sectoral filling of the iris vasculature seen in fluorescein iris angiography.",M1
20019359,"<e>Iris</e> pigment epithelial cells express a functional lipopolysaccharide receptor complex.PURPOSE: Ocular pigment epithelial cells are hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of acute anterior uveitis (AAU), where LPS activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) may serve as a trigger. In this study, the expression of LPS receptors in iris pigment epithelium (IPE) was determined. METHODS: RT-PCR, flow cytometry, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the expression of the LPS receptor complex (TLR4, MD-2, and CD14) in primary human IPE. Cytokine secretion by LPS-treated IPE was measured by multiplex bead array and ELISA. The role of CD14 in modulating the LPS response was investigated by addition of soluble CD14 and by antibody neutralization studies. In vivo expression of CD14 was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: IPE expressed TLR4, MD-2, and CD14 in vitro and secreted a panel of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL4, and CCL5) when stimulated with LPS. CXCL8 secretion by LPS-treated IPE was dependent on CD14 and TLR4. CD14 was detected in CD68+ cells in the iris by immunohistochemistry and in normal aqueous by Western blot analysis. Conclusions: IPE cells express a functional LPS receptor complex and are capable of promoting ocular inflammation through secretion of an array of proinflammatory mediators. CD14 was identified as a key molecule that modulated the LPS response in IPE.",M1

20009941,"Wavefront-guided ablation retreatment using <e>Iris</e> registration.PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy, predictability, safety, and intraoperative and postoperative complications of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) retreatment in myopic eyes using wavefront-guided ablation with iris registration (IR). METHODS: Retrospective analysis was used to evaluate wavefront-guided retreatment with IR in a consecutive cohort of 77 eyes (57 patients) after LASIK. The eyes were divided into two groups: no previous retreatment group (group 1) (n = 63) and previous LASIK retreatment group (group 2) (n = 14). The primary outcome variables assessed postoperatively at 1, 3, and 6 months were uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and pre- and postretreatment changes in manifest refraction. RESULTS: The mean preretreatment spherical equivalent in group 1 was reduced from -0.5 +/- 1.0 diopter (D) (range -3 to 2.4) to 0.06 +/- 0.3 (range -0.9 to 0.6) (P &lt; 0.002) at 6 months. In group 2, the mean preretreatment spherical equivalent was reduced from -0.9 +/- 1.24D (range -3.1 to -0.5) to 0.04 +/- 0.5 (range -1.0 to 1.1) (P &lt; 0.049) at 6 months. At 6 months, UCVA was 20/20 or better in 92% in group 1 and 64% in group 2, of patients, respectively. No eyes lost more than one line of BCVA in group 1 and one eye (7%) lost two lines of BCVA in group 2. CONCLUSION: Wavefront-guided LASIK retreatment with IR after LASIK is an effective, predictable, and safe procedure in cases requiring a single retreatment. In contrast, eyes with previous retreatments showed less predictability and lower percentage of eyes with postoperative 20/20 UCVA.",M1

19967668,"Toxic anterior segment syndrome following <e>iris</e>-supported phakic IOL implantation with viscoelastic Multivisc BD.PURPOSE: To report on the association between Multivisc BD and toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) post phakic intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. METHODS: Two patients developed severe toxic anterior chamber inflammation following implantation of phakic iris fixated IOL with Multivisc BD viscoelastic. Anterior chamber washout was performed with intracameral antibiotic injection. Local antibiotics were continued until cultures were found to be negative. Thereafter, intensive local and systemic steroids were initiated and gradually tapered down. RESULTS: The inflammatory reaction disappeared completely and the visual acuity improved from hand motion to 6/9 without correction within 1 week. CONCLUSIONS: Any viscoelastic material may be contaminated by heat-stable bacterial endotoxic as it is prepared by gene-coded bacteria. It is suggested that Multivisc BD was the etiologic factor of TASS. Refractive surgeons should be aware of this rare complication of phakic IOL implantation whenever they use a new viscoelastic material.",M1

An argon laser peripherical iridoplasty was performed and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) was employed to follow-up. Initially, the patient had a favorable response to treatment, but six months later the cysts and the secondary closed angle reappeared. DISCUSSION: Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty has been proposed as treatment of plateau-like iris configuration resulting from neuroepithelial ciliary body cysts. However, the cysts and, the secondary closed angle could recur in a long-term (Arch Soc Esp Oftalmol 2009; 84: 569-572).",M1
19959894,"Effects of various selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors on relaxation and cyclic nucleotide contents in porcine <e>iris</e> sphincter.The effects of various selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors on muscle contractility and cyclic nucleotide contents in porcine iris sphincter were investigated. Forskolin and sodium nitroprusside inhibited carbachol (CCh)-induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. Various selective PDE inhibitors, vinpocetine (type 1), erythro -9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA, type 2), milrinone (type 3), Ro20-1724 (type 4) and zaprinast (type 5), also inhibited CCh-induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. The rank order of potency of IC(50) was zaprinast &gt; Ro20-1724 &gt; EHNA &gt;/= milrinone &gt; vinpocetine. In the presence of CCh (0.3 muM), vinpocetine, milrinone and Ro20-1724 increased cAMP, but not cGMP, contents. In contrast, zaprinast and EHNA both increased cGMP, but not cAMP, contents. This indicates that vinpocetine-, milrinone- and Ro20-1724-induced relaxation is correlated with cAMP, while EHNA- and zaprinast- induced relaxation is correlated with cGMP in porcine iris sphincter.",M1
19959639,"Suppression of bystander T helper 1 cells by <e>iris</e> pigment epithelium-inducing regulatory T cells via negative costimulatory signals.PURPOSE: To determine whether iris pigment epithelium (IPE)-induced T regulatory (Treg) cells can suppress the activation of bystander T cells with cell contact via costimulatory interactions. METHODS: CD8(+) T cells were cocultured with IPE, x-irradiated, and then used as regulators (IPE-induced Treg cells). The target CD4(+) T cells from wild-type control or knockout donors were used for the assay. T-cell activation was assessed for proliferation by examining both [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation and cytokine production. Expression of costimulatory molecules on IPE-induced Treg cells was evaluated using RT-PCR, immunostaining, and flow cytometry. Expression of costimulatory receptors on target T cells or Treg cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. Neutralizing antibodies were then used to abolish regulatory function. RESULTS: CD8(+) IPE-induced Treg cells significantly suppressed the activation of effector target T cells, e.g., T-cell proliferation and cytokine production such as Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines. Although IPE-induced Treg cells expressed various costimulatory molecules, including programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), only PD-L1 on the Treg cells was actually delivered to target Th1 cells using cell-to-cell interaction (T-T interaction). If neutralizing antibodies for PD-L1 were cocultured with Treg cells, Th1 suppression was impaired. Moreover, Treg cells failed to suppress IFNgamma production by target CD4(+) T cells from programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) knockout donors. Th1-specific inhibition was exclusively achieved with direct cell contact. CONCLUSIONS: T cells exposed to IPE in the eye that acquires full regulatory capacity express negative costimulators and suppress bystander Th1-type effector cells.",M1
19929596,"Effect of intracameral bevacizumab injection on corneal endothelial cells: an in vivo evaluation.BACKGROUND: We studied the effect of an intracameral bevacizumab injection on the corneal endothelium and <e>iris</e> neovessels (INV). METHODS: Ten eyes were studied in 10 patients with an average age of 52.1 +/- 13.17 years. Patients underwent intracameral bevacizumab injections at a concentration of 1.25 mg/0.05 mL. Intraocular pressure, best-corrected visual acuity, gonioscopy, neovascular membrane extent, anterior segment photography, iris fluorescein angiography, pachymetry, and specular microscopy were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: The minimum follow-up period was 4 months. INVs started to regress within the first 2 days after the injection and regressed completely by the end of the fourth week. Reduction in INV leakage started 1 week after injection, and resolved in 8 eyes (80%) by the end of the fourth week. Intraocular pressure dropped significantly from 17.8 +/- 4.8 mmHg to 16.6 +/- 2.8 mmHg over 4 weeks. The mean endothelial cell loss was 3.95% +/- 6.78%. CONCLUSIONS: An intracameral bevacizumab injection proved to be safe for corneal endothelial cells.",M1
19928726,"Distinctive findings in a patient with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome using high-resolution AS-OCT.Some distinct findings of a patient with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome from the anterior chamber angle images by high-resolution anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) are described.

19923002,"Optical coherence tomography quantitative analysis of <e>iris</e> volume changes after pharmacologic mydriasis.PURPOSE: To describe a method using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS OCT) for estimating iris volume. To quantify changes in iris volume induced by pharmacologic mydriasis in narrow-angle eyes predisposed to angle-closure compared with normal open-angle eyes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty fellow eyes of 30 patients who had an episode of primary acute angle-closure and 30 eyes of 30 normal age- and gender-matched subjects with open angles. All fellow eyes had a patent laser peripheral iridotomy. METHODS: Iris volume and all biometric measurements were performed before and after instillation of 1% tropicamide and at least 1 week later 10% phenylephrine. Iris volume was estimated using AS OCT radial sections of the iris and a customized image-processing software. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Iris volume, pupil diameter, angle configuration including angle opening distance at 500 mum (AOD 500) and trabecular-iris space at 500 mum (TISA 500), AS OCT anterior chamber depth, and A-scan ultrasonography axial length before and after pupil dilation. RESULTS: Iris volumes measured before dilation of the pupil were 44.94+/-2.1 mm(3) and 44.29+/-3.9 mm(3) in the fellow eyes and open-angle eyes, respectively, which was not significantly different (P&gt;0.1). Thirty minutes after instillation of 1% tropicamide, mean iris volume increased significantly in the fellow eyes (from 44.94+/-2.1 mm(3) to 49.92+/-2.9 mm(3); P&lt;0.01), whereas it decreased significantly in the open-angle eyes (from 44.29+/-3.9 mm(3) to 37.88+/-2.2 mm(3); P&lt;0.01). Similar changes were observed after instillation of 10% phenylephrine. Based on multivariate analysis, significant predictors of increase in iris volume after pupil dilation were eyes predisposed to angle-closure compared with open-angle eyes (P = 0.008), larger pupil diameter (P = 0.02), and brown eyes (P = 0.01). Relative iris volume increase was correlated significantly with AOD 500 and TISA 500 relative decrease in the narrow-angle group (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The iris volume may be estimated with AS OCT. The iris volume increases after pupil dilation in narrow-angle eyes predisposed to acute angle closure. In those patients, this biometric change is associated with a narrowing of the angle despite a patent laser peripheral iridotomy.

19912043,"Evaluation of deafness in American Paint Horses by phenotype, brainstem auditory-evoked responses, and endothelin receptor B genotype.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate deafness in American Paint Horses by phenotype, clinical findings, brainstem auditory-evoked responses (BAERs), and endothelin B receptor (EDNBR) genotype. DESIGN: Case series and case-control studies. ANIMALS: 14 deaf American Paint Horses, 20 suspected-deaf American Paint Horses, and 13 nondeaf American Paint Horses and Pintos. PROCEDURES: Horses were categorized on the basis of coat color pattern and eye color. Testing for the EDNBR gene mutation (associated with overo lethal white foal syndrome) and BAERs was performed. Additional clinical findings were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: All 14 deaf horses had loss of all BAER waveforms consistent with complete deafness. Most horses had the splashed white or splashed white-frame blend coat pattern. Other patterns included frame overo and tovero. All of the deaf horses had extensive head and limb white markings, although the amount of white on the neck and trunk varied widely. All horses had at least 1 partially heterochromic <e>iris</e>, and most had 2 blue eyes. Ninety-one percent (31/34) of deaf and suspected-deaf horses had the EDNBR gene mutation. Deaf and suspected-deaf horses were used successfully for various performance events. All nondeaf horses had unremarkable BAER results. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Veterinarians should be aware of deafness among American Paint Horses, particularly those with a splashed white or frame overo coat color pattern, blend of these patterns, or tovero pattern. Horses with extensive head and limb markings and those with blue eyes appeared to be at particular risk.",M1
19899971,"TrkB-T1 receptors on Muller cells play critical role in brain-derived neurotrophic factor-mediated photoreceptor protection against phototoxicity.PURPOSE: To determine how brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protects photoreceptors against phototoxicity. METHODS: <e>Iris</e> pigment epithelial cells (IPE) that were transduced with different concentrations of adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated BDNF (AAV-BDNF-IPE) were transplanted into the subretinal space of rats. We also injected small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for TrkB, a BDNF receptor. The rats were exposed to continuous light to induce phototoxicity. We examined the expression of TrkB in the retina by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Significant photoreceptor protection was detected when more than 1 x 10(7) capsids/ml AAV-BDNF was transplanted. An intravitreal injection of siRNAs showed that the photoreceptor protection by AAV-BDNF-IPE was reduced by injecting the siRNA of TrkB-T1, one of the TrkB isoforms. TrkB-T1 was slightly upregulated by Western blot, and one of the cells that upregulated TrkB-T1 was Muller cells by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Muller cells are one of the cells responsible for the expression of TrkBs, and TrkB-T1 may play a role in the protection of photoreceptors against phototoxicity.",M1

DESIGN: Prospective, noninterventional consecutive case series. METHODS: Fifteen eyes with foldable acrylic IOL implantation using peripheral iris suture fixation in the absence of capsular support were included. UBM was used to determinate the haptic position in relation to the ciliary sulcus and ciliary body in these eyes. Additionally, anterior chamber depth, lens tilt, site of suture fixation, focal iris or angle abnormalities, and relationship of iris to lens were determined. Main outcome measures were haptic position, anterior chamber depth, and iris anatomic changes. RESULTS: Of the 30 haptics imaged, 16 (53.3%) were positioned in the ciliary sulcus. Nine (30%) haptics were found over the ciliary processes, and 5 (16.7%) were over pars plana. No patients were found to have peripheral anterior synechiae present at the haptic position. The mean (+/- standard deviation) depth of the anterior chamber was 3.84 +/- 0.36 mm. The iris profile was altered in all patients at the iris-haptic suture fixation site. No angle abnormalities or tilted lenses were found. CONCLUSIONS: Iris-sutured PCIOL haptics were found to be in the ciliary sulcus or over the ciliary body with no significant tilt on UBM analysis. The procedure respects the angle anatomy, and no evidence of angle closure was found. The anterior chamber was deeper than has been reported previously for scleral sutured PCIOLs and was similar to that of pseudophakic eyes. This may have implications for surgical technique, IOL power calculations, and postoperative complications.",M1

19878757,"Angle-closure glaucoma-simpler answers to complex mechanisms: LXVI Edward Jackson Memorial Lecture.PURPOSE: To present evidence-based concepts that will explain mechanisms of angle-closure glaucoma. DESIGN: Review of published evidence and personal perspective. METHODS: Literature review and clinical research using imaging devices. RESULTS: When the pupil dilates, the <e>iris</e> typically decreases its volume by losing extracellular fluid. Eyes with angle-closure lose less iris volume with pupil dilation, contributing to obstruction of the trabecular meshwork. Expansion of choroidal volume is a dynamic phenomenon and is a major risk factor in angle-closure. The mechanism of malignant glaucoma seems likely to result from poor conductivity of fluid through the vitreous, and past suggestions that it results from  misdirected  aqueous are not consistent with physiological principles. CONCLUSIONS: Angle-closure and angle-closure glaucoma result from disturbed physiological mechanisms more than from simple anatomic measures, and future predictive testing can exploit knowledge of these factors.",M1

The aim of this study was both the ultrastructural identification of the peripheral nervous fibers entering the grafts from host iris and the estimation of their capacity to establish true synaptic contacts with the central nervous system neurons of the grafts. The bundles of myelinated and unmyelinated axons, surrounded by the Schwann cell cytoplasm, were observed within the perivascular spaces of the ingrowing blood vessels. In the neuropil areas of the grafts, both types of the peripheral nervous fibers were also identified. It was demonstrated on the ultrastructural level that the unmyelinated axons lost their glial envelope of the Schwann cell and formed the typical asymmetric synapses with the dendrites and dendritic spines of the grafted neurons. The results are indicative of the high morpho-functional plasticity of both parts of the nervous system.",M1

METHODS: This was a prospective interventional case series. Twelve aphakic vitrectomized eyes without capsular support underwent iris claw intraocular lens implantation. The main outcome measures were changes in uncorrected visual acuity, best-corrected visual acuity, spheric equivalent, corneal endothelial cell density, corneal thickness, central macular thickness, and complications. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 15.58 +/- 3.80 months with no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, uncorrected visual acuity increased significantly at all follow-up visits (P &lt; 0.05). Mean best-corrected visual acuity increased 10 letters/2 lines at the final follow-up visit (P = 0.023). Mean postoperative spheric equivalent at the last visit was -1.68 +/- 063 D, and the spheric equivalent was within +/-2.00 D of emmetropia in 9 (75%) eyes. Mean central macular thickness increased only at postoperative Month 3 (P = 0.043). Mean endothelial cell density loss was 23.87% at the last visit. Mean corneal thickness did not change during follow-up (P &gt; 0.05). No corneal edema was observed. Complications were transient intraocular pressure increase (n = 1), cystoid macular edema (n = 1), and haptic dislocation replaced by surgery (n = 1). Retinas remained attached in all eyes. CONCLUSION: Secondary iris claw intraocular lens implantation is clinically safe and effective to correct aphakia in vitrectomized eyes without capsular support. Larger studies with longer follow-up are warranted.",M1
19834142,"Ordinal measures for <e>iris</e> recognition.Images of a human iris contain rich texture information useful for identity authentication. A key and still open issue in iris recognition is how best to represent such textural information using a compact set of features (iris features). In this paper, we propose using ordinal measures for iris feature representation with the objective of characterizing qualitative relationships between iris regions rather than precise measurements of iris image structures. Such a representation may lose some image-specific information, but it achieves a good trade-off between distinctiveness and robustness. We show that ordinal measures are intrinsic features of iris patterns and largely invariant to illumination changes. Moreover, compactness and low computational complexity of ordinal measures enable highly efficient iris recognition. Ordinal measures are a general concept useful for image analysis and many variants can be derived for ordinal feature extraction. In this paper, we develop multilobe differential filters to compute ordinal measures with flexible intralobe and interlobe parameters such as location, scale, orientation, and distance. Experimental results on three public iris image databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ordinal feature models.",M1
19834039,"Qualitative assessment of ultrasound biomicroscopic images using standard photographs: the liwan eye study.Objective. To classify anatomic features related to anterior chamber angles by a qualitative assessment system based on ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) images. Methods. Cases of primary angle-closure suspect (PACS), defined by pigmented trabecular meshwork that is not visible in two or more quadrants on static gonioscopy (cases) and systematically selected subjects (1 of every 10) who did not meet this criterion (controls) were enrolled during a population-based survey in Guangzhou, China. All subjects underwent UBM examination. A set of standard UBM images was used to qualitatively classify anatomic features related to the angle configuration, including <e>iris</e> thickness, iris convexity, iris angulation, ciliary body size, and ciliary process position. All analysis was conducted on right eye images. Results. Based on the qualitative grades, the difference in overall iris thickness between gonioscopically narrow eyes (n = 117) and control eyes (n = 57) was not statistically significant. The peripheral one third of the iris tended to be thicker in all quadrants of the PACS eyes, although the difference was statistically significant only in the superior quadrant (P = 0.008). No significant differences were found in the qualitative classifications of iris insertion, iris angulation, ciliary body size, and ciliary process position. The findings were similar when compared with the control group of eyes with wide angles in all quadrants. Conclusions. Basal iris thickness seems to be more relevant to narrow angle configuration than to overall iris thickness. Otherwise, the anterior rotation and size of the ciliary body, the iris insertion, and the overall iris thickness are comparable in narrow- and wide-angle eyes.",M1

METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included 26 eyes of 26 patients with NVG. All eyes received conventional treatment for NVG and were randomly allocated to three 2.5 mg IVB injections at 4-week intervals or a sham procedure (subconjunctival normal saline) at similar time intervals and in the same setting. RESULTS: Overall, 14 eyes of 14 patients received IVB and 12 eyes of 12 subjects were allocated to the sham procedure and followed for a mean period of 5.9+/-1.4 months. The IVB group demonstrated significant reduction in IOP from a baseline value of 33.4+/-14.5 mm Hg to 21.8+/-13.7 mm Hg (P=0.007), 25.1+/-20 mm Hg (P=0.058), and 23.9+/-18.7 mm Hg (P=0.047) at 1, 3, and 6 months after intervention, respectively. NVI was also significantly reduced from a mean baseline value of 347+/-48 degrees to 206+/-185 degrees (P=0.01), 180+/-187 degrees (P=0.004), and 180+/-180 degrees (P=0.004) at 1, 3, and 6 months after intervention. In contrast, IOP and NVI remained unchanged or increased insignificantly at all follow-up intervals in the control group. No significant change in visual acuity was observed within the study groups at any time interval. The study groups were comparable in terms of requirement for additional interventions such as panretinal photocoagulation and cyclodestructive procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal injections of bevacizumab seem to reduce NVI and IOP in NVG and may be considered as an adjunct to more definitive surgical procedures for NVG.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intracameral bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 mL) was injected into 5 eyes of 5 New Zealand white rabbits. A balanced salt solution (0.05 mL) was injected intracamerally in another 5 rabbits as a control. The corneal thickness, endothelial cell counts, and intraocular pressure were measured before and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after the intracameral injection of bevacizumab and a balanced salt solution. Scanning electron microscopic examinations were performed at 1 and 4 weeks after injection. In the clinical cases, 6 patients who received an intracameral injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg) and Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation were enrolled. The visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and regression of <e>iris</e> rubeosis by iris fluorescein angiography were recorded before and at 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months after the intracameral bevacizumab injection and Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation. RESULTS: No morphologic and functional changes in the corneal endothelial cells were observed in the rabbit eyes after the intracameral bevacizumab and balanced salt solution injections. Iris rubeosis regression was observed in all eyes within 1 week after the injection. The visual acuity remained stable or improved, and the intraocular pressure was controlled in all eyes throughout the follow-up period. There were no ocular and systemic complications associated with the combined procedure.

19822841,"Plateau <e>iris</e> in Asian subjects with primary angle closure glaucoma.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of plateau iris in Asian eyes with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, subjects older than 40 years with PACG who had a patent laser peripheral iridotomy underwent UBM in 1 eye. Ultrasound biomicroscopy images were qualitatively analyzed using standardized criteria. Plateau iris in a quadrant was defined by anteriorly directed ciliary body, absent ciliary sulcus, steep iris root from its point of insertion followed by a downward angulation, flat iris plane, and irido-angle contact. At least 2 quadrants had to fulfill these UBM criteria for an eye to be classified as having plateau iris. RESULTS: One hundred eleven subjects (70 from Singapore, 41 from Thailand) with PACG were recruited. The mean (SD) age was 65.6 (8.1) years, and 63.9% were female. Based on standardized UBM criteria, plateau iris was found in 36 of 111 eyes (32.4%; 95% confidence interval, 24.4%-41.6%). In these 36 eyes, quadrant-wise analysis showed 66.7% had plateau iris in 2 quadrants; 22.2%, in 3 quadrants; and 11.1%, in all quadrants. CONCLUSIONS: About 30% of PACG eyes with a patent laser peripheral iridotomy were found to have plateau iris on UBM, highlighting the importance of non-pupil block mechanisms in Asian individuals.",M1

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, community-based study. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 2047 subjects &gt;50 years old without ophthalmic symptoms from a community clinic in Singapore. METHODS: All subjects underwent gonioscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) under dark conditions. An eye was considered to have narrow angles if the posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork was not visible for &gt;/=180 degrees on nonindentation gonioscopy with the eye in the primary position. Customized software was used on horizontal AS-OCT scans to measure I-Curv, I-Area, and iris thickness 750 mum (IT750) and 2000 mum (IT2000) from the scleral spur. The average of both temporal and nasal measured values of the right eye was used for analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The association between iris parameters and narrow angles on gonioscopy. RESULTS: Iris parameters from 1465 eyes (71.6%) were available for analysis. Of these, 315 subjects (21.5%) had narrow angles. The mean I-Curv (0.366 vs 0.259 mm; P&lt;0.020), IT750 (0.476 vs 0.453 mm; P&lt;0.001), and IT2000 (0.491 vs 0.482 mm; P = 0.010) were greater in persons with than without narrow angles. After adjusting for age, gender, anterior chamber depth, axial length, and pupil size, the greater I-Curv, I-Area, IT750, and IT2000 were significantly associated with narrow angles (odds ratio [OR] 2.5 and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-5.1; OR, 2.7 and 95% CI, 1.6-4.8; OR, 2.6 and 95% CI, 1.6-4.1; OR, 2.7 and 95% CI, 1.5-4.7, comparing 4th with 1st quartile for each parameter, respectively). In stratified analysis, women and subjects aged &gt;/=60 years had stronger associations for most iris parameters with narrow angles than men and younger subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative iris parameters (I-Curv, I-Area, and iris thickness) are independently associated with narrow angles, particularly in women and older subjects. These data provide further insights into the pathogenesis of angle closure in Singaporeans. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references.",M1
19797204,"Model to predict endothelial cell loss after <e>iris</e>-fixated phakic intraocular lens implantation.PURPOSE: To describe a model predicting endothelial cell (EC) loss after iris-fixated phakic intraocular lens (pIOL) implantation, taking distance from the edge of the pIOL to the endothelium into account. METHODS: This prospective observational study monitored long-term EC changes in 306 eyes after pIOL implantation. EC density (ECD) was determined before surgery, 6 months after surgery, and then annually up to 8 years after surgery. Mean follow-up was 31.7 +/- 25.7 months. All eyes underwent anterior segment optical coherence tomography to determine minimum distance from the edge of the pIOL to the endothelium. Linear mixed-model analysis was performed to present a model that describes EC loss as a linear decrease and an additional decrease depending on the postoperative edge distance of the patient. RESULTS: Mean minimum edge distance was 1.43 +/- 0.23 mm (range, 0.70-2.21 mm). For this mean edge distance, the model predicted a yearly EC loss of 1.0%, whereas an edge distance of 1.20 mm resulted in a yearly EC loss of 1.7%, and an edge distance of 1.66 mm led to a yearly EC loss of only 0.2%. Furthermore, the model predicted that for patients with preoperative ECDs of 3000, 2500 or 2000 cells/mm(2), and edge distances of 1.43 mm, a critical ECD of 1500 cells/mm(2) (at which point pIOL explantation and cataract extraction can still safely be performed) will be reached at 56, 37, and 18 years after implantation. CONCLUSIONS: The presented model predicts EC loss after iris-fixated pIOL implantation in relation to the measured edge distance, patient age, and preoperative ECD, which can assist ophthalmologists in patient selection and follow-up of pIOLs.",M1
19782072,"Autonomic drugs and the accommodative system in rhesus monkeys.Accommodation and pupil constriction result from parasympathetic stimulation from the Edinger-Westphal (EW) nucleus of the midbrain resulting in release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junctions of the ciliary muscle and <e>iris</e>. Cholinergic and adrenergic drugs can be applied topically to evaluate the effects on the pupil and accommodative system without input from the EW nucleus. This study is directed at characterizing how topical low dose echothiophate, an anti-cholinesterase inhibitor (i.e., an indirect cholinergic agonist), epinephrine, an adrenergic agonist, and timolol maleate, a beta adrenergic antagonist, affect pupil diameter, resting refraction and accommodative amplitude and dynamics in rhesus monkeys. The effects of 0.015% echothiophate, 2% epinephrine, 0.5% timolol maleate and saline on pupil diameter and resting refraction were measured in one eye each of four normal rhesus monkeys for 60-90 min following topical instillation. Pupil diameter was measured with infrared videography and refraction was measured with a Hartinger coincidence refractometer. Effects on static and dynamic EW stimulated accommodation were studied in three iridectomized monkeys (ages 5, 6 and 12 years) with permanent indwelling stimulating electrodes in the EW nucleus. Dynamic accommodative responses were measured with infrared photorefraction for increasing current amplitudes before and during the course of action of the pharmacological agents. Echothiophate caused a significant decrease in pupil diameter of 3.07 +/- 0.65 mm (mean +/- SEM, p &lt; 0.01), and a myopic shift in resting refraction of 1.30 +/- 0.39 D (p &lt; 0.05) 90 min after instillation. Epinephrine caused a 2.76 +/- 0.38 mm (p &lt; 0.01) increase in pupil diameter with no change in resting refraction 60 min after instillation. Timolol maleate resulted in no significant change in either pupil diameter or resting refraction 60 min after instillation. There was no significant change in maximum EW stimulated accommodative amplitude after any agent tested. The amplitude vs. peak velocity relationship for accommodation was significantly different after echothiophate and timolol maleate, and for disaccommodation after echothiophate, epinephrine and timolol maleate. In conclusion, when tested objectively in anesthetized monkeys, epinephrine and timolol maleate did not alter resting refraction or accommodative amplitude, but did have small, significant affects on accommodative dynamics. This suggests that there is an adrenergic component to the accommodative system. Low dose echothiophate had significant effects on pupil diameter and resting refraction, with only small effects on the dynamics of the accommodative response.",M1

19770714,"<e>Iris</e> melanoma arising from sector congenital ocular melanocytosis in a child.PURPOSE: To report a clinicopathologic correlation of a melanoma arising from iris component of ocular melanocytosis in a child. METHODS: A 13-year-old boy developed a progressive iris nodule arising from sector iris pigmentation that was a component of congenital ocular melanocytosis involving the iris, ciliary body and choroid. The tumor was examined clinically and with ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), removed by peripheral iridocyclectomy, and studied histopathologically. RESULTS: Clinically, the pigmented nodule was 3 mm in diameter, located within the sector iris pigmentation, and was 2.4 mm in thickness as measured by UBM. Histopathologically, it was composed predominately of spindle B melanoma cells with adjacent spindle and dendritic melanocytes compatible with iris melanocytosis. CONCLUSION: Although highly unusual, melanoma can arise in the sector iris pigmentation that is often a component of congenital ocular melanocytosis. Even young patients with ocular melanocytosis should be examined periodically for development of melanoma in the ciliary body and choroid.",M1

19761765,"Localization of vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) in the human eye.Recently we showed a critical role for Vascular Adhesion Protein-1 (VAP-1) in rodents during acute ocular inflammation, angiogenesis, and diabetic retinal leukostasis. However, the expression of VAP-1 in the human eye is unknown. VAP-1 localization was therefore investigated by immunohistochemistry. Five micrometer thick sections were generated from human ocular tissues embedded in paraffin. Sections were incubated overnight with primary mAbs against VAP-1 (5 microg/ml), smooth muscle actin (1 microg/ml), CD31 or isotype-matched IgG at 4 degrees C. Subsequently, a secondary mAb was used for 30 min at room temperature, followed by Dako Envision + HRP (AEC) System for signal detection. The stained sections were examined using light microscopy and the signal intensity was quantified by two evaluators and graded into 4 discrete categories. In all examined ocular tissues, VAP-1 staining was confined to the vasculature. VAP-1 labeling showed the highest intensity in both arteries and veins of neuronal tissues: retina and optic nerve, and the lowest intensity in the <e>iris</e> vasculature (p &lt; 0.05). Scleral and choroidal vessels showed moderate staining for VAP-1. VAP-1 intensity was significantly higher in the arteries compared to veins (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, VAP-1 staining in arteries colocalized with both CD31 and smooth muscle actin (sm-actin) staining, suggesting expression of VAP-1 in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells or potentially pericytes. In conclusion, immunohistochemistry reveals constitutive expression of VAP-1 in human ocular tissues. VAP-1 expression is nearly exclusive to the vasculature with arteries showing significantly higher expression than veins. Furthermore, VAP-1 expression in the ocular vasculature is heterogeneous, with the vessels of the optic nerve and the retina showing highest expressions. These results characterize VAP-1 expression in human ocular tissues.",M1

19751491,"<e>Iris</e> abscesses with and without intralenticular fungal invasion in the horse.OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and histologic findings in horses with iris abscesses. Design Retrospective medical records study. ANIMALS STUDIED: Medical records of horses that had iris abscesses at the University of Florida Veterinary Medical Center, Peterson &amp; Smith Equine Hospital, and Veterinary Eye Specialists of London, Ontario, from 2005 to 2008 were reviewed. PROCEDURE: Data collected from the medical records included signalment, clinical and histologic descriptions of ocular lesions, therapy, complications, and visual outcomes. RESULTS: The medical records of two Quarterhorses, one pony, one warmblood, one Westphalian, and one Arab horse with unilateral iris abscesses were identified. Mild-to-severe clinical signs of iridocyclitis were present in all six eyes with iris abscesses. The eyes of two horses with iris abscesses were also associated with deep stromal abscesses and responded to medical therapy alone in one case, and medical therapy and corneal transplantation in the other. Iris abscesses in two horses were also associated with intralenticular invasion due to a Cladosporium and a Fusarium-type fungus respectively, and resulted in enucleations. Two horses with iris abscesses and no apparent lens involvement resolved with medical therapy in one case and surgical removal of the iris abscess and medical therapy in the other. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first clinical report of iris abscesses in the horse, and the first histologic report of fungal invasion of the horse lens.",M1
19745666,"Follow-up of primary angle closure suspects after laser peripheral iridotomy using ultrasound biomicroscopy and A-scan biometry for a period of 2 years.AIM: To determine the morphologic changes in the anterior segment of primary angle closure suspects (PACS) who underwent laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) for a period of 2 years. METHODS: PACS (n=82 eyes) of Asian Indian origin who attended the Glaucoma clinic of tertiary eye hospital underwent A-scan biometry and ultrasound biomicroscopy. Anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber angle (ACA), axial length, lens thickness, relative lens position, central corneal thickness, angle opening distance 500, trabecular-ciliary process distance, <e>iris</e>-ciliary process distance, and iris thickness were measured before LPI and after LPI at 1 week, 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, and 2 years. Variation in the parameters measured over a period of 2 years was analyzed. RESULTS: Fifteen eyes out of 52 eyes developed into primary angle closure (PAC) with synechial changes. Univariate analysis for the predictive factors of PAC showed no significant association for age, sex, narrow angle, ultrasound biomicroscopy parameters, and vertical cup-disc ratio. When analyzed as continuous variables, decreasing ACA was significant risk factor (95% confidence interval: 0.703, 0.989, P=0.037). Iris-ciliary process distance, ACA, lens thickness, and angle opening distance 500 were the parameters that varied significantly (P&lt;0.05) between  before LPI group  and  after LPI groups.  None of the subjects developed increased intraocular pressure after laser iridotomy. CONCLUSIONS: In this hospital-based study on the course of PACS subjects after LPI, as many as 28% progressed to PAC. Decreasing ACA was the predictive factor for the progression of PACS to PAC. There was no increase in intraocular pressure, history, or symptoms of acute attack of glaucoma among the study subjects after LPI.",M1
19741732,"High efficiency non-viral transfection of retinal and <e>iris</e> pigment epithelial cells with pigment epithelium-derived factor.Transplantation of pigment epithelial cells in patients with age-related macular degeneration and Parkinson's disease has the potential to improve functional rehabilitation. Genetic modification of cells before transplantation may allow the delivery of neuroprotective factors to achieve functional improvement. As transplantation of cells modified using viral vectors is complicated by the possible dissemination of viral particles and severe immune reactions, we have explored non-viral methods to insert genetic material in pigment epithelial cells. Using lipofection or nucleofection ARPE-19 cells, freshly isolated and primary retinal and iris pigment epithelial (IPE) cells were transfected with plasmids encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and with three plasmids encoding recombinant pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and GFP. Transfection efficiency was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and stability of protein expression by immunoblotting. Pigment epithelial cells were successfully transfected with plasmid encoding GFP. Expression of GFP in ARPE-19 was transient, but was observed for up to 1 year in IPE cells. Analysis of pigment epithelial cells transfected with PEDF plasmids revealed that PEDF fusion proteins were successfully expressed and functionally active. In conclusion, efficient transfer of genetic information in pigment epithelial cells can be achieved using non-viral transfection protocols.",M1
19737877,"Expression of podoplanin and other lymphatic markers in the human anterior eye segment.PURPOSE: To investigate the expression of lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) markers in tissues of the anterior eye segment. METHODS: Sections of human anterior segments from eight eyes of eight donors (37-100 years) were stained for Vegf-R3, Prox-1, Lyve-1, Pdpn, Pcx, CCR7, Ccl19, Ccl21, and CD68. Pdpn localization was additionally analyzed by immunogold labeling on sections of five eyes. Expression of LEC markers and chemokine receptor/ligands was analyzed by RT-PCR in <e>iris</e> and trabecular meshwork (TM) tissue from three eyes and eight human TM (hTM) cell cultures. RESULTS: Vegf-R3 and Prox-1 stained no structures in the anterior segment. Lyve-1 stained single dendriform cells in the ciliary body, the TM, and the iris. Pdpn stained all trabecular cells, the cells of the trabeculum ciliare, and the anteriormost perimysium cells of the ciliary muscle. Schlemm's canal endothelium was not stained but reacted to a podocalyxin antibody. In the iris stroma, single dendriform cells were stained; at the anterior surface, almost all cells were Pdpn(+). Few stromal cells were Pdpn(+)/Lyve(+), but several anterior surface cells were Pdpn(+)/Ccl21(+). Solitary CCR7(+) cells were observed there, too. IF results were confirmed by PCR, but Prox-1 was detected in TM and iris. Cultured hTM cells displayed partial Pdpn/Ccl21 colocalization. CONCLUSIONS: Coexpression of Pdpn and Ccl21 at the anterior iris surface and in the chamber angle suggests the constitution of a chemokine gradient guiding APCs through the anterior chamber. The more pronounced expression of Pdpn in the TM could favor egression of APCs by way of the conventional outflow.",M1
19684003,"In vivo imaging of ocular MCMV infection.PURPOSE: To develop a technique by which murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection can be confirmed and monitored in vivo in various ocular compartments and to investigate the dynamics and time course of primary ocular CMV infection. METHODS: The ability of recombinant MCMV-expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) to serve as a tool to monitor the in vivo dynamics of experimental intraocular CMV infection was examined. Immunocompetent BALB/c mice were infected subretinally with eGFP-MCMV. Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) was used to visualize viral spread in vivo on sequential days after infection. Eyes were processed for histology and immunofluorescence microscopy to confirm viral infection and replication by means of GFP signal. RESULTS: Retina was readily permissive to primary infection with eGFP-mCMV, and fluorescent signal was detected by SLO 24 hours after subretinal injection, with scattered foci around the posterior pole of the retina. GFP levels in the retina reached a maximum on day 6. Signal in the <e>iris</e> developed from day 4 and lasted until day 25. Examinations of retinal and iris tissue wholemounts by immunofluorescence revealed signal localized to the outer retina, iris stroma, and anterior lens capsule. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to noninvasively monitor infectious agents in the eye may improve current knowledge of the course and pathogenesis of intraocular infections and could lead to further clarification of the mechanisms by which the immune system responds to intraocular pathogens.",M1
19668957,"Comparative biometric study between plateau <e>iris</e> configuration and primary open angle glaucoma with narrow angle.PURPOSE: To investigate biometrically the differences between plateau iris configuration (PIC) eyes and primary open angle glaucoma with narrow angle eyes. METHODS: A comparative study involving a case series with 20 eyes of 11 plateau iris configuration patients and 45 eyes of 27 primary open angle glaucoma with narrow angle eyes patients was done. The following measurements were taken: corneal curvature, central corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness (LT), axial length (AL), lens thickness and axial length ratio, lens position (LP) and relative lens position (RLP). RESULTS: The plateau iris configuration eyes presented a higher corneal cuvature value than primary open angle glaucoma with narrow angle eyes eyes but not with clinical and statistical difference (P=0.090). The plateau iris configuration eyes demonstrated a higher central corneal thickness, with statistical significance, when compared to primary open angle glaucoma with narrow angle eyes (P=0.010). Statistical significant difference between plateau iris configuration and primary open angle glaucoma with narrow angle eyes was found in axial length (21.69 +/- 0.98 vs. 22.42 +/- 0.89; P=0.003). No significant difference was found when anterior chamber depth (2.62 +/- 0.23 vs. 2.71 +/- 0.31; P=0.078), LT (4.67 +/- 0.36 vs. 4.69 +/- 0.45; P=0.975), LT/AL (2.16 +/- 0.17 vs. 2.10 +/- 0.21; P=0.569), LP (4.95 +/- 0.25 vs. 5.06 +/- 0.34; P=0.164) and RLP (0.23 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.22 +/- 0.14; P=0.348) were evaluated.

19667804,"Acute ocular injuries caused by 60-Ghz millimeter-wave exposure.The goal of this study was to examine the clinical course of 60-GHz millimeter-wave induced damages to the rabbit eye and to report experimental conditions that allow reproducible induction of these injuries. The eyes of pigmented rabbits (total number was 40) were irradiated with 60-GHz millimeter-waves using either a horn antenna or one of two lens antennas (6 and 9 mm diameter; phi6, phi9) Morphological changes were assessed by slit-lamp microscopy. Additional assessments included corneal fluorescein staining, <e>iris</e> fluorescein angiography, and lens epithelium light microscopy. Under the standardized eye-antenna positioning, the three antennas caused varying damages to the eyelids or eyeglobes. The most reproducible injuries without concurrent eyelid edema and corneal desiccation were achieved using the phi6 lens antenna: irradiation for 6 min led to an elevation of the corneal surface temperature (reaching 54.2 +/- 0.9 degrees C) plus corneal edema and epithelial cell loss. Furthermore, mitotic cells appeared in the pupillary area of the lens epithelium. Anterior uveitis also occurred resulting in acute miosis (from 6.6 +/- 1.4 to 2.2 +/- 1.4 mm), an increase in flares (from 6.7 +/- 0.9 to 334.3 +/- 130.8 photons per second), and iris vasodilation or vessel leakage. These findings indicate that the three types of millimeter-wave antennas can cause thermal injuries of varying types and levels. The thermal effects induced by millimeter-waves can apparently penetrate below the surface of the eye.",M1

DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: Settings: Department of Ophthalmology, University of Minnesota School of Medicine. PATIENTS: A 29-year-old man presented with bilateral redness, severe pain, photophobia, and reduction in visual acuity. Examination revealed intraocular pressure (IOP) of 38 mm Hg and 40 mm Hg right and left eye respectively, bilateral conjunctival injection 3+, epithelial corneal edema, microhyphema, cells 3+ to 4+ and flare 2+, bilateral cosmetic iris implants, and surgical peripheral iridectomies. The patient was diagnosed with UGH syndrome and corneal decompensation associated with cosmetic iris implants. INTERVENTION: Immediate medical management of inflammation and elevated IOP, anterior segment imaging, specular microscopy, Humphrey 24-2 visual field (VF) testing; following failed conservative management, combined trabeculectomy and removal of the iris implants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anterior chamber inflammation and microhyphema, IOP, and corneal edema. RESULTS: Anterior segment imaging demonstrated bilateral implant-iris apposition and implant-angle structures apposition. Specular microscopy demonstrated a significant reduction of the number of endothelial cells. VF test demonstrated a right superior arcuate scotoma and a normal left VF. Following surgical treatment IOP normalized and inflammation and microhyphema subsided. However, mild corneal edema persisted. CONCLUSION: Cosmetic iris implantation may lead to UGH syndrome and corneal decompensation. Therefore, its use should be reserved for patients with significant medical indications, and avoided in patients with intact natural iridies, until more short-term and long-term safety data are available.",M1
19641932,"Ultrastructural analysis of the pigment dispersion syndrome in DBA/2J mice.PURPOSE: To characterise ocular pigment abnormalities associated with <e>iris</e> atrophy in DBA/2J mice as a model for human pigment dispersion syndrome. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, electron and light microscopy were performed to examine the eyes of DBA/2J mice ranging in age from 2.5 to 18 months old. The focus of our study was the description of the ultrastructural modifications in the irides of DBA/2J mice. RESULTS: The DBA/2J mice presented modifications in the melanosomes in all the pigmented parts of the eye, including the retinal pigment epithelial cells and choroidal melanocytes of the ciliary pigment epithelium. The extracellular matrix of the iris stroma disappeared with ageing. Pigmented cells detached from the iris and migrated into the trabecular meshwork exclusively on the anterior iris surface. These cells were identified as macrophages by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. There was no evidence that melanocytes or iris pigment epithelial cells migrated into the trabecular meshwork, but they became more and more depigmented. The aqueous outflow was blocked by pigment-laden cells, but not by cellular debris or melanosomes. No substantial amount of extracellular melanosomes was observed. CONCLUSION: The morphology of melanosomes is aberrant in all pigment cells in the eyes of DBA/2J mice. We conclude that the disease process begins with the transfer of both immature melanosomes from the iris pigment epithelium (IPE) and melanocytes to macrophages, which subsequently migrate into the trabecular meshwork. Accumulating macrophages cause a blockade of the chamber angle. As the disease progresses, the IPE, melanocytes and iris stroma, including blood vessels, disappear, leading to iris atrophy. It is speculated that the loss of these pigment cells is partly caused by reduction of the iris stroma.",M1
19626878,"[Comparative research on wastewater treatment with two hydrophytes by FTIR]The spectra of root, stem, leaf of two hydrophytes (Oenanthe javanica and <e>Iris</e> pseudacorus) with CK, low, medium and high metal treatment (Cr, Fe, Mn and Zn) were determined directly, fast and accurately by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry with OMNI-sampler. The results showed that the peak shape of plant component remained invariable basically when absorbing heavy metals. Significant absorption peak shifts of some functional groups such as hydroxy groups (3,328-3,361 cm(-1)), carboxyl groups (1,402-1,440 cm(-1)), and acidamide groups (1,620-1,645 cm(-1)) can be seen when they participated in the process of absorbing heavy metals. The varieties of organic characteristic peaks were also capable of reflecting physiology and metabolism changes. With increasing heavy metal concentration, the absorption intensity of most root characteristic peaks correlated with physiology decreased significantly for the two hydrophytes, but it was decreased for stem, leaf characteristic peaks of Oenanthe javanica. The absorbance of stem, leaf was bigger than the control for different heavy metals for Iris pseudacorus. To sum up, although two hydrophytes could endure certain concentration of heavy metals, the tolerance of Iris pseudacorus was greater than that of Oenanthe javanica. With strong identifying ability, exact determination results and fast response function, the application of FTIR method has been popularized gradually in the field of environmental science. Recently, greater progress has been made in the study and use of FTIR in the fields of environmental accident emergent monitoring, environmental monitoring and environmental chemistry research. The infrared spectra could also be widely used to monitor changes in chemical composition of plant parts under stresses and environmental restoration and supply the best evidence for phytoremediation. This method was an important tool for detecting unknown pollutants and environmental monitoring.",M1
19622003,"CYP1B1, a developmental gene with a potential role in glaucoma therapy.The association of CYP1B1 gene alterations in primary congenital glaucoma individuals has been known for about a decade. Recent evidence has shown the involvement of CYP1B1 mutations in a number of forms of glaucoma and anterior segment disorders. This suggests a wide role for CYP1B1 in ocular physiology. Histochemical studies of eyes from individuals with primary congenital glaucoma revealed abnormalities in the anterior chamber angle, the region between the cornea and the <e>iris</e>, containing the trabecular meshwork. The cells of the trabecular meshwork serve as a filter to allow drainage of the aqueous humour, the fluid formed by the ciliary body that fills the anterior chamber. Mutations in CYP1B1 that affect its activity have frequently been shown to influence development of the trabecular meshwork, and it is thought that CYP1B1, a monooxygenase, acts to form or degrade some endobiotic compound that is necessary for proper development of the filtering structures. The rapidly developing area of stem cell research suggests a potential therapeutic approach for glaucomas resulting from deleterious mutations in CYP1B1, that is, the transfer of stem cells, differentiated to a specific lineage, containing wild-type CYP1B1 to specific regions of the eye, where they will develop into normal cells of that region and rectify the defect.",M1
19619260,"Genetics of human <e>iris</e> colour and patterns.The presence of melanin pigment within the iris is responsible for the visual impression of human eye colouration with complex patterns also evident in this tissue, including Fuchs' crypts, nevi, Wolfflin nodules and contraction furrows. The genetic basis underlying the determination and inheritance of these traits has been the subject of debate and research from the very beginning of quantitative trait studies in humans. Although segregation of blue-brown eye colour has been described using a simple Mendelian dominant-recessive gene model this is too simplistic, and a new molecular genetic perspective is needed to fully understand the biological complexities of this process as a polygenic trait. Nevertheless, it has been estimated that 74% of the variance in human eye colour can be explained by one interval on chromosome 15 that contains the OCA2 gene. Fine mapping of this region has identified a single base change rs12913832 T/C within intron 86 of the upstream HERC2 locus that explains almost all of this association with blue-brown eye colour. A model is presented whereby this SNP, serving as a target site for the SWI/SNF family member HLTF, acts as part of a highly evolutionary conserved regulatory element required for OCA2 gene activation through chromatin remodelling. Major candidate genes possibly effecting iris patterns are also discussed, including MITF and PAX6.",M1
19618947,"Human iridal stroma melanosomes of varying pheomelanin contents possess a common eumelanic outer surface.Uveal melanosomes originating in the iridal stroma contain both black (eumelanin) and red (pheomelanin) pigment. Recent studies reveal that the eumelanin/pheomelanin ratio varies with <e>iris</e> color, with lower ratios being observed for lighter color (hazel, blue) irides. This is of great interest because the epidemiology of uveal melanomas also indicates an increased incidence for lighter-colored irides. Herein, we examine human iridal stroma melanosomes from dark brown and blue-green irides, which are characterized by a eumelanin/pheomelanin ratio of 14.8 and 1.3, respectively. Atomic force microscopy reveals that the melanosomes extracted from these different colored irides have a similar size and overall morphology. Studies of the surface ionization potentials reveal that the surface of these melanosomes is pure eumelanin, despite the significant difference in their overall pigment composition. These data indicate that the pheomelanin present in the melanosome is encased by eumelanin, providing support for the  casing model  architecture of mixed melanins advanced from kinetic studies of the early steps in the melanogenesis pathway. Because of the different bulk composition, these results indicate that the thickness of the outer eumelanin coating decreases as the iride color lightens. Oxidative damage to the melanosome surface is therefore more likely to enable access to the photoreactive pheomelanin in the lighter irides than that in the eumelanin-rich dark irides. This provides new insights into the potential contribution of iridal stroma melanosomes both to inducing oxidative stress and to accounting for the observed iris-color-dependent epidemiology of uveal melanoma.",M1

However, OA1 has rarely been reported in China. Here, we report on a Chinese family with OA1 and partial deletion of GPR143. An unusual phenotype of iris hyperpigmentation without translucency was observed in the male patient and the carrier mother. There was apparent mosaic pigmentation of the fundus. Our results demonstrate atypical manifestation of OA1 that might enrich our knowledge of phenotypic variation of OA1 among the Chinese population.",M1
19603617,"Effect of <e>iris</e> registration on outcomes of LASIK for myopia with the VISX CustomVue platform.PURPOSE: To compare visual outcomes after LASIK using the VISX STAR S4 CustomVue, with and without Iris Registration technology. METHODS: In this retrospective study, LASIK was performed on 239 myopic eyes, with or without astigmatism, of 142 patients. Iris registration LASIK was performed on 121 eyes and non-iris registration LASIK was performed on 118 eyes. Primary outcome measures were uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), and manifest refraction. RESULTS: At 6 months, the mean values for UCVA (logMAR) were 0.00 +/- 0.09 in the iris registration group and -0.01 +/- 0.11 in the non-iris registration group (P = .587). Seventy-nine percent of eyes in the iris registration group had UCVA of 20/20 or better compared to 78% in the non-iris registration group (P = .518). Ninety-two percent of eyes in the iris registration group and 90% in the non-iris registration group were within +/- 0.50 diopters (D) of emmetropia (P = .999). Mean postoperative absolute change in total root-mean-square higher order aberrations in the iris registration group and non-iris registration group was 0.22 microm and 0.19 microm, respectively (P = .6). At 3 months, the mean magnitude of error of surgically induced astigmatism was -0.09 in the iris registration group and -0.04 in the non-iris registration group (P = .25). CONCLUSIONS: Wavefront-guided LASIK with the VISX STAR S4 CustomVue laser system, independent of iris registration status, is effective, safe, and predictable. Under well-controlled surgical conditions, this study did not find any statistical significance supporting the better achievement of visual acuity, astigmatism correction, or the lesser induction of higher order aberrations using iris registration in comparison to a non-iris registration system.",M1

We then approximate the scattering features of the captured iris. Finally, we propose a real-time rendering technique based on the subsurface texture mapping representation and introduce a precomputed refraction function as well as a caustic function, which accounts for the light interactions at the corneal interface.",M1
19574626,"Toward accurate and fast <e>iris</e> segmentation for iris biometrics.Iris segmentation is an essential module in iris recognition because it defines the effective image region used for subsequent processing such as feature extraction. Traditional iris segmentation methods often involve an exhaustive search of a large parameter space, which is time consuming and sensitive to noise. To address these problems, this paper presents a novel algorithm for accurate and fast iris segmentation. After efficient reflection removal, an Adaboost-cascade iris detector is first built to extract a rough position of the iris center. Edge points of iris boundaries are then detected, and an elastic model named pulling and pushing is established. Under this model, the center and radius of the circular iris boundaries are iteratively refined in a way driven by the restoring forces of Hooke's law. Furthermore, a smoothing spline-based edge fitting scheme is presented to deal with noncircular iris boundaries. After that, eyelids are localized via edge detection followed by curve fitting. The novelty here is the adoption of a rank filter for noise elimination and a histogram filter for tackling the shape irregularity of eyelids. Finally, eyelashes and shadows are detected via a learned prediction model. This model provides an adaptive threshold for eyelash and shadow detection by analyzing the intensity distributions of different iris regions. Experimental results on three challenging iris image databases demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed.",M1
19563798,"Pax6 dosage requirements in <e>iris</e> and ciliary body differentiation.Pax6 is a highly conserved transcription factor that controls the morphogenesis of various organs. Changes in Pax6 dosage have been shown to affect the formation of multiple tissues. PAX6 haploinsufficiency leads to aniridia, a pan-ocular disease primarily characterized by iris hypoplasia. Herein, we employ a modular system that includes null and overexpressed conditional alleles of Pax6. The use of the Tyrp2-Cre line, active in iris and ciliary body (CB) primordium, enabled us to investigate the effect of varying dosages of Pax6 on the development of these ocular sub-organs. Our findings show that a lack of Pax6 in these regions leads to dysgenesis of the iris and CB, while heterozygosity impedes growth of the iris and maturation of the iris sphincter. Overexpression of the canonical, but not the alternative splice variant of Pax6 results in severe structural aberrations of the CB and hyperplasia of the iris sphincter. A splice variant-specific rescue experiment revealed that both splice variants are able to correct iris hypoplasia, while only the canonical form rescues the sphincter. Overall, these findings demonstrate the dosage-sensitive roles of Pax6 in the formation of both the CB and the iris.",M1
19555685,"Morphine-induced nitric oxide production in isolated, <e>iris</e>-ciliary bodies.Considerable evidence suggests that the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signaling pathway plays an integral role in opioid receptor-mediated responses in the cardiovascular and immune systems. Previous studies in our laboratory and others have shown that nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in morphine-induced reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) and pupil diameter (PD) in the New Zealand white (NZW) rabbit. The present study is designed to determine the effect of morphine on NO production in the isolated, iris-ciliary body (ICB), site of aqueous humor production, as this effect could be associated with morphine-stimulated changes in aqueous humor dynamics and iris function. ICBs obtained from normal NZW rabbits were utilized in these experiments. In some experiments, ICB samples were treated with morphine (1, 10 and 100 microM) for 1 h and later examined for changes in NO levels using a NO detection kit. In other experiments, tissue samples were pretreated with naloxone (non-selective opioid receptor antagonist), L-NAME (non-selective NO-synthase inhibitor) or GSH (sulfhydryl reagent) for 30 min, followed by treatment with morphine (10 muM). Morphine caused a concentration-dependent increase in the release of NO from ICBs. Levels of NO detected in the incubation medium of ICB samples increased from 1.49 +/- 0.19 (control) to 8.81 +/- 2.20 microM/mg protein (morphine-treated; 100 microM). Morphine-stimulated release of NO was significantly inhibited in tissues pretreated with 10 microM naloxone, L-NAME, or GSH. Results obtained from this study suggest that morphine stimulates NO release from the ICB through a mechanism that involves activation of NO-releasing opioid receptors. These results support the in vivo effects of morphine demonstrated in previous studies.",M1
19553625,"Anterior chamber angle opening during corneoscleral indentation: the mechanism of whole eye globe deformation and the importance of the limbus.PURPOSE: To determine how mechanical interaction among <e>iris</e>, cornea, limbus, sclera, and IOP contribute to angle opening during indentation of the cornea or sclera. METHODS: A finite-element model of the globe was developed. The model consisted of three elastic isotropic segments--iris, cornea, and sclera--and a two-component anisotropic segment representing the limbus. The model was tested against published in vitro experiments and then applied to angle opening during indentation in vivo. Indentation of the central cornea with a cotton bud, indentation with a small or large eyecup during ultrasound biomicroscopy, indentation with a gonioscopy lens, and scleral indentation during goniosynechialysis were modeled. RESULTS: The anisotropic limbus model matched published data better than any isotropic model. Simulation of all clinical cases gave results in agreement with published observations. The model predicted angle opening during indentation by a cotton bud or small eyecup but angle narrowing when the sclera was indented by a large eyecup. The model of indentation gonioscopy showed narrowing of the angle on the indentation side and opening of the angle on the opposite side. Nonuniform opening of the angle was predicted when the scleral surface was indented. CONCLUSIONS: The two-component model of the stiff fibers embedded in a soft matrix captured the mechanical properties of the complex limbal region effectively. The success of this model suggests that, at least in part, corneoscleral mechanics drive angle opening rather than aqueous humor pressurization.",M1
19545903,"Bilateral acute depigmentation of the <e>iris</e>: report of 26 new cases and four-year follow-up of two patients.PURPOSE: To report new cases of bilateral acute depigmentation of the iris (BADI), a recently described clinical entity, and to report the 4-year follow-up of 2 patients that was published previously. DESIGN: A retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six Turkish patients who were diagnosed with BADI between 2006 and 2008 and 2 patients who were reported previously. METHODS: We reviewed the patients' charts and clinical photographs. Observation procedures included clinical examination, anterior segment color photography, laser flare photometry, and pupillometry. We performed an anterior chamber tap in 2 patients for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to demonstrate the DNA of herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the aqueous samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic features, presenting symptoms, laboratory findings, changes in iris stromal pigment and architecture, and time to resolution of pigment dispersion in the anterior chamber. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were female, and 7 patients were male. Mean age was 32.3+/-8.6 years. All had bilateral involvement. Twenty patients (76.9%) presented with photophobia and red eyes, and 4 patients (15.4%) presented with a recent change in eye color. Ten patients (38.5%) had flu-like symptoms preceding the onset of ocular symptoms. Diagnostic laboratory workup, viral serology, and PCR analysis of the aqueous humor were unrewarding. Diffuse depigmentation of the iris stroma from the collarette to the iris root was seen in 16 patients, and geographic areas of depigmentation were seen in 10 patients. There was heavy pigment deposition in the trabecular meshwork in all patients. Anterior chamber flare was elevated in eyes with circulating pigment. The pupil was not affected. Twenty patients received topical corticosteroids. Pigment dispersion resolved in 1 to 16 weeks (median, 9 weeks). The intraocular pressure was elevated in 8 steroid-treated eyes but was controlled with antiglaucomatous medications. In 2 patients reported previously, the depigmented iris stroma became repigmented after 4 years. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BADI present with bilateral, symmetrical, nontransilluminating depigmentation of the iris stroma and pigment discharge into the anterior chamber. Young female persons are more commonly affected. The cause remains unknown. After 4 years, the ocular findings in 2 patients normalized.",M1

19520458,"[<e>Iris</e>-fixated intraocular lenses: reinforced monitoring]In 1986, the concept of the claw lens was applied to correct myopia in phakic patients. Since then, progress has made iris-fixated phakic intraocular lenses (IOL) relatively safe, predictable, and effective for the correction of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. All these models have undergone a series of design improvements to prevent complications. Despite having excellent refractive results, the principal risk is a potential progressive endothelial cell loss. Many authors have presented encouraging results. Phakic iris-fixated IOL surgery is a potentially reversible procedure, but the surgeon cannot rule out the possibility of complications. Therefore, long-term follow-up is mandatory.",M1
19516012,"A quantitative assessment of the burden and distribution of Lisch nodules in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1.PURPOSE: The presence of two or more Lisch nodules (melanocytic hamartomas of the <e>iris</e>) is one of seven diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common monogenic disorder of dysregulated neurocutaneous growth. The hypothesis that Lisch nodules arise secondary to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight was investigated. METHODS: Lisch nodule burden was mapped and quantified in the irides of 77 adults with NF1. Lifetime sunlight (UV radiation) exposure was inventoried, NF1 neurocutaneous severity determined, and two NF1 mutations predictive of severity selectively genotyped. RESULTS: There was high interindividual variability in Lisch nodule burden. Lisch nodules were primarily located in the inferior hemifield (half) of the iris, regardless of its color (P = 3.0 x 10(-20)). Light irides harbored significantly more Lisch nodules than dark irides (P = 4.8 x 10(-5)). There was no statistically significant correlation of Lisch nodule burden to lifetime sunlight exposure  dose  or NF1 neurocutaneous severity. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in Lisch nodule burden between the superior and inferior iris hemifields is most likely due to the sunlight-shielding effects on the superior half by periocular structures. The difference in Lisch nodule burden between light and dark irides is probably due to the photoprotective effects of pigmentation. The genes underlying the control of iris color may thus be viewed as modifiers of severity of Lisch nodule burden in NF1. Given the role of UV radiation and, presumably, DNA damage in Lisch nodule pathogenesis,  benign tumor of the iris,  not  hamartoma,  may be a better descriptor.",M1
19516005,"Sensitivity of ocular anterior chamber tissues to oxidative damage and its relevance to the pathogenesis of glaucoma.PURPOSE: The anterior chamber of the eye is a highly specialized structure delimited by the cornea, lens, and <e>iris</e>. It contains the aqueous humor, secreted by the ciliary body and drained by the trabecular meshwork. Alteration of aqueous humor homeostasis plays a major role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. The trabecular meshwork is the target tissue of glaucoma in the anterior chamber, and the development and progression of glaucoma are accompanied by accumulation of oxidative damage in this tissue. This study was conducted to comparatively evaluate the sensitivity to oxidative stress of anterior chamber tissues including the cornea, iris, and trabecular meshwork. METHODS: Cornea, iris, and trabecular meshwork fragments collected from six cornea donors were either left untreated or treated with hydrogen peroxide. Oxidative damage was determined by evaluating nucleotide oxidative modifications (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) and apurinic alkali-fragile sites by capillary electrophoresis. RESULTS: The results indicated that the basal level of oxidative nucleotide modifications was higher in the cornea than in the iris and trabecular meshwork. The trabecular meshwork was the most sensitive tissue to oxidative damage, as after exposure to hydrogen peroxide both markers of oxidative damage dramatically increased in the trabecular meshwork but not in the cornea and iris. CONCLUSIONS: Because the cornea and iris are directly exposed to light, they possess antioxidant defense mechanisms that are not activated in the trabecular meshwork. The peculiar sensitivity of the trabecular meshwork to oxidative stress is consistent with the damage selectively induced in it, triggering glaucoma's pathogenic cascade.",M1

There were 6 women and 7 men, aged 17 to 69 years (mean age 44.4 years). METHODS: Patient information was collected, including history and medications used, and a complete ophthalmologic evaluation was performed, with careful documentation of iris detail and pupillary size. RESULTS: Thirteen of 13 patients demonstrated some degree of iris atrophy; 9 of 13 had pupillary dilation on the affected side despite not being on dilating drops.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred patients were included in this prospective study. Intraoperative adverse events, such as pupillary constriction, iris billowing, and iris prolapse from the wound, were noted. Multinomial regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome with pseudoexfoliation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, pupil diameter, and A1AB use. RESULTS: Pupil constriction was significantly associated with pseudoexfoliation (P &lt; .001). Diabetes mellitus was associated with pupil constriction and iris billowing (P = .005 and .003, respectively). Hypertension was associated with pupil constriction (P = .021). Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome was strongly associated with A1AB use and male gender (P &lt; .001 and .039, respectively). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome was observed in 2.8% of patients and was strongly related to A1AB use, particularly in smaller pupil diameters. Pseudoexfoliation, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were not associated with intraoperative floppy iris syndrome.",M1
19477709,"A cross-sectional and longitudinal study of Fuchs uveitis syndrome in Turkish patients.PURPOSE: To describe Turkish patients with Fuchs uveitis syndrome (FUS). DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 172 patients with FUS seen at Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, between January 1995 and July 2007. The main outcome measures were demographic features, clinical findings at presentation, laser flare photometry values, risk of new complications, and rate of decreased vision. RESULTS: The mean age was 29.5 + 8.4 years. Male-to-female ratio was 1:1.3. Nine patients (5.2%) had bilateral involvement. The diagnosis of FUS had been made in only 10 of 115 (8.7%) referrals. Clinical findings at presentation included diffuse keratic precipitates (medium-sized round in 74.6%, fine-stellate in 22.1%), anterior chamber cells (74%), diffuse <e>iris</e> atrophy without hypochromia (48.6%), heterochromia (39.8%), iris nodules (32%), cataract/pseudophakia (69.1%), vitreous cells (71.8%), elevated intraocular pressure (12.7%), and chorioretinal scars (7.7%). The mean flare was 8.4 + 3.1 photons/ms in eyes with FUS and 3.7 + 0.8 photons/ms in the fellow eyes (P &lt; .001). Hyperfluorescence of the optic disc was the only fluorescein angiographic finding, detected in 7 of 32 eyes (22%). Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated risks of cataract formation and intraocular pressure elevation as 42% and 17%, respectively, at 4 years. The rate of decreased visual acuity by 2 lines or more was 0.06/eye-year. CONCLUSIONS: The referral patterns suggest that FUS is frequently misdiagnosed in Turkish patients. Diffuse medium-sized round keratic precipitates, low flare readings, iris stromal atrophy without hypochromia, and vitreous opacities in the absence of macular edema are more often helpful clues to the diagnosis than heterochromia.",M1
19466984,"Expression of distinct alpha 1-adrenoceptor phenotypes in the <e>iris</e> of pigmented and albino rabbits.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The expression of multiple pharmacological phenotypes including alpha(1L)-adrenoceptor has recently been reported for alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. The purpose of the present study was to identify alpha(1)-adrenoceptor phenotypes in the irises of pigmented and albino rabbits. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Radioligand binding and functional bioassay experiments were performed in segments or strips of iris of pigmented and albino rabbits, and their pharmacological profiles were compared. KEY RESULTS: [(3)H]-silodosin at subnanomolar concentrations bound to intact segments of iris of pigmented and albino rabbits at similar densities (approximately 240 fmol x mg(-1) protein). The binding sites in the iris of a pigmented rabbit were composed of a single component showing extremely low affinities for prazosin, hydrochloride [N-[2-(2-cyclopropylmethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]-5-chloro-alpha,alpha-dimethyl-1H-indole-3-ethamine hydrochloride (RS-17053)] and 5-methylurapidil, while two components with high and low affinities for prazosin, RS-17053 and 5-methylurapidil were identified in irises from albino rabbits. In contrast, specific binding sites for [(3)H]-prazosin were not clearly detected because a high proportion of non-specific binding and/or low affinity for prazosin occurred. Contractile responses of iris dilator muscle to noradrenaline were antagonized by the above ligands, and their antagonist affinities were consistent with the binding estimates at low-affinity sites identified in both strains of rabbits. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A typical alpha(1L) phenotype with extremely low affinity for prazosin is exclusively expressed in the iris of pigmented rabbits, while two distinct phenotypes (alpha(1A) and alpha(1L)) with high and moderate affinities for prazosin are co-expressed in the iris of albino rabbits. This suggests that a significant difference in the expression of phenotypes of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor occurs in the irises between the two strains of rabbits.",M1

19450580,"Ex vivo porcine <e>iris</e> stiffening due to drug stimulation.The purpose of this study was to quantify how the elastic modulus of the ex vivo iris changes following stimulation by pilocarpine (PILO), phenylephrine (PE), and tropicamide (TROP). Irides (n = 20) were dissected from porcine eyes within 4 h post-mortem and tested uniaxially. Either the entire iris or sector thereof was used. The samples were stretched up to 40% Green strain. The radial modulus was calculated from the linear portion of the stress-strain curve, and the azimuthal modulus was fitted to a model treating the iris as a collection of circular elastic bands. One of the three drugs (n = 6 or 7) of interest was added (80 microg/ml) to the bath surrounding the tissue, and the test was repeated. Changes in pupil diameter of free-floating samples and isometric force of mounted samples confirmed that the tissue was responsive to the drugs. The untreated iris modulus for cut sections in radial extension was 4.0 +/- 0.9 kPa (mean +/- s.d., n = 20), and treated iris modulus was 7.7 +/- 2.0 kPa (PILO, n = 7), 6.9 +/- 2.2 kPa (PE, n = 6), and 8.4 +/- 1.7 kPa (TROP, n = 7). Intact irides (n = 10) gave similar trends but values approximately 25% higher, presumably due to support from the nominally unloaded tissue. The azimuthal modulus of the untreated iris was 2.97 +/- 1.3 kPa (n = 5), and that of the treated iris (PILO) was 5.34 +/- 2.1 kPa. Although PILO, PE, and TROP work by different mechanisms, all three had similar results - an increase of modulus by a factor of two. These results suggest that in most normal situations the iris remains compliant at all pupil diameters.",M1
19450450,"Human <e>iris</e> pigment epithelium suppresses activation of bystander T cells via TGFbeta-TGFbeta receptor interaction.Iris pigment epithelial (IPE) cells from the anterior segment in the eye are able to suppress activation of bystander responder T cells in vitro. The cultured IPE cells fully suppress proliferation and cytokine production by responder T cells via direct cell-to-cell contact. We have now investigated whether primary cultured human iris pigment epithelial (h-IPE) cells that were established from fresh iris tissues can also inhibit the activation of T cells in vitro. We found that cultured h-IPE cells significantly inhibited T cell proliferation and the IFN-gamma production by the target T cells from both the allogeneic and autogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The h-IPE cells also inhibited the activation of CD4(+) T cells from patients with active uveitis. The suppression by h-IPE occurred in a completely contact-dependent manner. The h-IPE constitutively expressed transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and the receptors, and the T cells exposed to h-IPE greatly expressed Smad transcripts. In addition, TGFbeta2-siRNA transfected h-IPE failed to inhibit activation of responder T cells. Similarly, h-IPE cells in the presence of anti-TGFbeta neutralizing antibodies or recombinant TGFbeta receptor blocking proteins failed to inhibit the T-cell activation. In conclusion, cultured human iris pigment epithelium fully inhibits T cell activation in vitro. Our data support the hypothesis that the ocular resident cells play a critical role in immunosuppression in the eye.",M1
19449303,"Identification of genes expressed preferentially in the developing peripheral margin of the optic cup.Specification of the peripheral optic cup by Wnt signaling is critical for formation of the ciliary body/<e>iris</e>. Identification of marker genes for this region during development provides a starting point for functional analyses. During transcriptional profiling of single cells from the developing eye, two cells were identified that expressed genes not found in most other single cell profiles. In situ hybridizations demonstrated that many of these genes were expressed in the peripheral optic cup in both early mouse and chicken development, and in the ciliary body/iris at subsequent developmental stages. These analyses indicate that the two cells probably originated from the developing ciliary body/iris. Changes in expression of these genes were assayed in embryonic chicken retinas when canonical Wnt signaling was ectopically activated by CA-beta-catenin. Twelve ciliary body/iris genes were identified as upregulated following induction, suggesting they are excellent candidates for downstream effectors of Wnt signaling in the optic cup.",M1
19436266,"AAV-mediated tyrosinase gene transfer restores melanogenesis and retinal function in a model of oculo-cutaneous albinism type I (OCA1).Oculo-cutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) is characterized by congenital hypopigmentation and is due to mutations in the TYROSINASE gene (TYR). In this study, we have characterized the morpho-functional consequences of the lack of tyrosinase activity in the spontaneous null mouse model of OCA1 (Tyr(c-2j)). Here, we show that adult Tyr(c-2j) mice have several retinal functional anomalies associated with photoreceptor loss. To test whether these anomalies are reversible upon TYR complementation, we performed intraocular administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vector, encoding the human TYR gene, in adult Tyr(c-2j) mice. This resulted in melanosome biogenesis and ex novo synthesis of melanin in both neuroectodermally derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and in neural crest-derived choroid and <e>iris</e> melanocytes. Ocular melanin accumulation prevented progressive photoreceptor degeneration and resulted in restoration of retinal function.

METHODS: In a case series of 20 patients (39 eyes), the position of the pIOL to the natural lens and the cornea was evaluated under photopic (135 lux) and low mesopic (&lt; 1 lux) circumstances with anterior segment optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: The distance between the pIOL and the natural lens decreased, and congruently, the distance from the pIOL to the corneal endothelium increased under low mesopic circumstances. CONCLUSIONS: The distance between the pIOL and the corneal endothelium increases when the pupil dilates under dark circumstances, contributing to the already excellent safety data available on pIOL implantation.",M1

Morphometric traits exhibited significant plastic responses to the environmental variability between native and anthropogenic habitats that differed in light quantity and quality, as well as in some other ecological indices. Significant differentiation between populations occupying those habitats was also detected.

Results showed that the dry weights (DWs) of shoots and roots of I. pseudacorus were significantly decreased at 500 mg L(-1)Pb and 25 mg L(-1)Cd + 500 mg L(-1)Pb treatments and the root DWs under all treatments were significantly decreased in comparison with that of control. The concentrations of Chla in the leaves were decreased at all treatments, while, the concentrations of Chlb and total carotenoids were not significantly decreased under 25 mg L(-1)Cd and 25 mg L(-1)Cd + 500 mg L(-1)Pb treatments. The MDA and proline concentrations and POD activities in the shoots and roots were increased under treatments of 500 mg L(-1)Pb and 25 mg L(-1)Cd + 500 mg L(-1)Pb, but POD activities in the shoots and roots and MDA concentrations in the shoots were significantly decreased at 25 mg L(-1) Cd treatment. The results of sub-cellular localization of Pb and Cd showed that numerous Pb deposits were found on the inner surface of died cell walls in the cortex treated with 2,070 mg L(-1) Pb and Cd deposits were found in the cell wall treated with 1,000 mg L(-1) Cd. Pb and Cd deposits were not found in the cytoplasm. The results indicated that POD and proline showed strong beneficial properties against Pb and Cd stress and there were some mechanisms keeping most cells with normal activities in the plant from Pb toxicity by sacrificing a few cells that accumulated a large amount Pb.

We mined an I. brevicaulis-I. fulva EST database for simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and developed ortholog-specific EST-SSR markers for genetic mapping and other genotyping applications in Iris. Here, we describe the abundance and other characteristics of SSRs identified in the transcript assembly (EST database) and the cross-species utility and polymorphisms of I. brevicaulis-I. fulva EST-SSR markers among wild collected ecotypes and horticulturally important cultivars. RESULTS: Collectively, 6,530 ESTs were produced from normalized leaf and root cDNA libraries of I. brevicaulis (IB72) and I. fulva (IF174), and assembled into 4,917 unigenes (1,066 contigs and 3,851 singletons). We identified 1,447 SSRs in 1,162 unigenes and developed 526 EST-SSR markers, each tracing a different unigene. Three-fourths of the EST-SSR markers (399/526) amplified alleles from IB72 and IF174 and 84% (335/399) were polymorphic between IB25 and IF174, the parents of I. brevicaulis x I. fulva mapping populations. Forty EST-SSR markers were screened for polymorphisms among 39 ecotypes or cultivars of seven species - 100% amplified alleles from wild collected ecotypes of Louisiana Iris (I.brevicaulis, I.fulva, I. nelsonii, and I. hexagona), whereas 42-52% amplified alleles from cultivars of three horticulturally important species (I. pseudacorus, I. germanica, and I. sibirica). Ecotypes and cultivars were genetically diverse - the number of alleles/locus ranged from two to 18 and mean heterozygosity was 0.76. CONCLUSION: Nearly 400 ortholog-specific EST-SSR markers were developed for comparative genetic mapping and other genotyping applications in Iris, were highly polymorphic among ecotypes and cultivars, and have broad utility for genotyping applications within the genus.",M2

RESULT: The quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamntin were separated well, and the result shows that the content of quercetin in the Iris lactea Pall was the highest (1.536%), the contene of kaempferol in Persica persice was the highest (0.572%), and the content of isorhamntin in chrysamthemum morifolium was up to 0.290%. CONCLUSION: The contents of flavonoids in these flowers were by determined RP-HPLC for the first time and the method can be used for quantitative determination of flavonoids in the flowers.",M2
19151041,"Environmental effects on the maturation of the endodermis and multiseriate exodermis of <e>Iris</e> germanica roots.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Most studies of exodermal structure and function have involved species with a uniseriate exodermis. To extend this work, the development and apoplastic permeability of Iris germanica roots with a multiseriate exodermis (MEX) were investigated. The effects of different growth conditions on MEX maturation were also tested. In addition, the exodermises of eight Iris species were observed to determine if their mature anatomy correlated with habitat. METHODS: Plants were grown in soil, hydroponics (with and without a humid air gap) or aeroponics. Roots were sectioned and stained with various dyes to detect MEX development from the root apical meristem, Casparian bands, suberin lamellae and tertiary wall thickenings. Apoplastic permeability was tested using dye (berberine) and ionic (ferric) tracers. KEY RESULTS: The root apical meristem was open and MEX development non-uniform. In soil-grown roots, the exodermis started maturing (i.e. Casparian bands and suberin lamellae were deposited) 10 mm from the tip, and two layers had matured by 70 mm. In both hydro- and aeroponically grown roots, exodermal maturation was delayed. However, in areas of roots exposed to an air gap in the hydroponic system, MEX maturation was accelerated. In contrast, maturation of the endodermis was not influenced by the growth conditions. The mature MEX had an atypical Casparian band that was continuous around the root circumference. The MEX prevented the influx and efflux of berberine, but had variable resistance to ferric ions due to their toxic effects. Iris species living in well-drained soils developed a MEX, but species in water-saturated substrates had a uniseriate exodermis and aerenchyma. CONCLUSIONS: MEX maturation was influenced by the roots' growth medium. The MEX matures very close to the root tip in soil, but much further from the tip in hydro- and aeroponic culture. The air gap accelerated maturation of the second exodermal layer. In Iris, the type of exodermis was correlated with natural habitat suggesting that a MEX may be advantageous for drought tolerance.",M2
19140069,"Comparative free radical scavenging potential and cytotoxicity of different extracts from <e>Iris</e> pseudopumila Tineo flowers and rhizomes.Different Iris species are known as medicinal plants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of different extracts from Iris pseudopumila Tineo flowers and rhizomes. The radical scavenging activity was assessed by means of DPPH assay. The antioxidant activity was assessed by means of two tests: bleaching of beta-carotene and lipid peroxidation of liposomes. Methanolic and chloroform extracts from the flowers of I. pseudopumila showed a significant antiradical effect with IC(50) of 101 and 83 microg mL(-1), respectively. As regards to lipid peroxidation, the best activity was showed by methanolic extract of flowers (IC(50) of 18 microg mL(-1)) and chloroformic extract of rhizomes (IC(50) 33 microg mL(-1)). The cytotoxic activity was carried out using the SRB assay. The chloroform extract from rhizomes demonstrated a good cytotoxic activity against amelanotic melanoma cancer cell line (C32) with an IC(50) of 57 microg mL(-1).

After June, the cations contents in plant increased with growth. Root Ca2+ and Na+ contents were the highest in July, being 2.30% and 0.51%, respectively, while root K+ and Mg2+ contents were the highest in September (0.27%) and October (0.28%), respectively.

Koidz. and I. tectorum Maxim. were studied using plants grown in sand culture and exposed to 0-10 mmol l(-1) concentrations of Pb supplied as Pb(NO3)(2) for 28 days. A significant reduction in dry weight (dw) of shoots and roots of I. lactea var. chinensis was observed at 6 and 10 mmol l(-1), respectively, and a significant reduction in dw of shoots and roots of I. tectorum was observed at 6 mmol l(-1). Concentration of Pb in the shoots and roots of I. lacteal var. chinensis exposed to 4 mmol l(-1) Pb reached 1,109 microg g(-1) and 2,408 microg g(-1) dw, respectively. The index of tolerance (IT) of I. lactea var. chinensis among 0-8 mmol l(-1) Pb treatments were not significantly different, while those of I. tectorum at 6 mmol l(-1) Pb were significantly decreased. The results indicated that I. lactea var. chinensis was more tolerant to Pb than I. tectorum. Sub-cellular localization of Pb in root cells was evaluated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Pb deposits were found along the plasma membrane of some root tip cells of I. lactea var. chinensis treated at 10 mmol l(-1) Pb. Deposits of Pd were also observed along the surface, in the root tip cell wall and in the cytoplasm of a few malformed cells of I. tectorum exposed at 10 mmol l(-1) Pb treatment. One possible mechanism to explain these observations may be that most cells can maintain normal activities in the plant by sacrificing a small number of cells that accumulate a large amount Pb and show toxicity. Future studies should be designed to test this hypothesis.",M2

18297403,"Characterization and comparative analysis of sequence-specific amplified polymorphisms based on two subfamilies of IRRE retrotransposons in <e>Iris</e> missouriensis (Iridaceae).DNA markers based on transposable-element polymorphisms are potentially useful alternatives to anonymous fragment-length polymorphisms (AFLPs). We developed the retrotransposon sequence-specific amplified polymorphism (retrotransposon SSAP) technique for the angiosperm Iris missouriensis (Iridaceae) in order to evaluate its use in generating population-genetic markers. Our cloning strategy identified two groups of long-terminal repeat retrotransposons of the IRRE family. Primers homologous to conserved regions of these elements generated repeatable and polymorphic markers. In comparison, the AFLP protocol failed to produce useful markers in our hands in this species. To investigate the distribution and evolutionary tempo of the two retrotransposons, we developed a phylogeny of representative species of subgenus Limniris based on chloroplast sequence. Sequences of both groups of retrotransposons were widespread in Limniris, but we also found evidence of substantial sequence and copy-number evolution since the divergence of I. missouriensis from other Limniris species. We corroborated these results with quantitative real-time PCR estimates of relative copy number. Importantly, the geographic structure of retrotransposon SSAP was strikingly different for the two groups of retrotransposons, indicating that different mutational dynamics and/or selective pressures govern their distribution. Although these primers should be useful for population-genetic studies of Iris missouriensis and other Limniris species, our findings reinforce the need for caution in evaluating transposable-element markers used to analyze the relatedness of populations or cultivars, as very different conclusions may be reached depending on the sequence amplified.",M2
18266989,"The genetic architecture of reproductive isolation in Louisiana irises: pollination syndromes and pollinator preferences.In animal-pollinated plants, pollinator preferences for divergent floral forms can lead to partial reproductive isolation. We describe regions of plant genomes that affect pollinator preferences for two species of Louisiana Irises, <e>Iris</e> brevicaulis and Iris fulva, and their artificial hybrids. Iris brevicaulis and I. fulva possess bee and bird-pollination syndromes, respectively. Hummingbirds preferred I. fulva and under-visited both I. brevicaulis and backcrosses toward this species. Lepidopterans preferred I. fulva and backcrosses toward I. fulva, but also under-visited I. brevicaulis and I. brevicaulis backcrosses. Bumblebees preferred I. brevicaulis and F1 hybrids and rarely visited I. fulva. Although all three pollen vectors preferred one or the other species, these preferences did not prevent visitation to other hybrid/parental classes. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, in reciprocal BC1 mapping populations, defined the genetic architecture of loci that affected pollinator behavior. We detected six and nine QTLs that affected pollinator visitation rates in the BCIb and BCIf mapping populations, respectively, with as many as three QTLs detected for each trait. Overall, this study reflects the possible role of quantitative genetic factors in determining (1) reproductive isolation, (2) the pattern of pollinator-mediated genetic exchange, and thus (3) hybrid zone evolution.",M2

A worm motility inhibition assay was used for in vitro study and a faecal egg count reduction assay was used for an in vivo study. The in vitro study revealed anthelmintic effects of crude aqueous extracts and crude ethanolic extracts on live Trichuris ovis worms (P &lt; or = 0.05) as evident from their paralysis and/or death at 8 h after exposure. The aqueous extracts of I. hookeriana resulted in a mean worm motility inhibition of 54.0%, while ethanolic extracts resulted in a mean worm motility inhibition of 84.6%. The mean mortality index of aqueous extracts was 0.55, while for ethanolic extracts it was 0.85. The lethal concentration 50 for aqueous extracts was 0.45 mg ml- 1 and for ethanolic extracts it was 0.15 mg ml- 1. The in vivo anthelmintic activity of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of I. hookeriana in sheep naturally infected with mixed species of gastrointestinal nematodes demonstrated a maximum (45.62%) egg count reduction in sheep treated with ethanolic extracts at 2 g kg- 1 body weight on day 10 after treatment, closely followed by ethanolic extracts at 1 g kg- 1 body weight on day 10 after treatment (43.54% egg count reduction). The aqueous extracts resulted in a maximum of 31.53% reduction in faecal egg counts on day 10 after treatment with 1 g kg- 1 body weight. Thus ethanolic extracts exhibited greater anthelmintic activity under both in vitro and in vivo conditions; this could be due to the presence of alcohol-soluble active ingredients in I. hookeriana. From the present study it can be suggested that I. hookeriana rhizome exhibited significant anthelmintic activity against gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep and has the potential to contribute to the control of gastrointestinal nematode parasites of small ruminants.",M2

17908219,"Phylogeography of <e>Iris</e> missouriensis (Iridaceae) based on nuclear and chloroplast markers.We investigated the phylogeography of Iris missouriensis (Iridaceae), which is widely distributed in western North America. We utilized transposon display and DNA sequencing to quantify nuclear and chloroplast genetic structure. Our objectives were (i) to characterize the geographic structure of genetic variation throughout the species range, (ii) to test whether both margins of the range show reduced genetic diversity as predicted by north-south expansion and contraction associated with climate change, and (iii) to determine whether the subspecies Iris missouriensis ssp. longipetala is genetically distinct. We found that genetic diversity was significantly lower in the northern part of the range but was not significantly different between the central and southern regions, indicating greater stability of the southern margin vs. the northern. Among-population differentiation was high (PhiPT=0.52). The largest divisions in each marker set were concordant and separated the southern Rocky Mountains and Basin and Range provinces from the remainder of the range. The boundaries of this phylogeographic break do not coincide with gaps in present-day distributions or phylogeographic breaks identified in other species, and may indicate a measure of reproductive isolation. Consistent with current treatments, we did not find support for the taxonomic placement of I. missourienis ssp. longipetala as a distinct species. Although transposon display has been used to investigate relationships among crop accessions and their wild relatives, to our knowledge, this is the first use of these markers for population-level phylogeography of a nonmodel species and further demonstrates their utility in species recalcitrant to amplified fragment length polymorphism protocols.",M2
17725637,"QTL analysis of floral traits in Louisiana <e>iris</e> hybrids.The formation of hybrid zones between nascent species is a widespread phenomenon. The evolutionary consequences of hybridization are influenced by numerous factors, including the action of natural selection on quantitative trait variation. Here we examine how the genetic basis of floral traits of two species of Louisiana Irises affects the extent of quantitative trait variation in their hybrids. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was used to assess the size (magnitude) of phenotypic effects of individual QTL, the degree to which QTL for different floral traits are colocalized, and the occurrence of mixed QTL effects. These aspects of quantitative genetic variation would be expected to influence (1) the number of genetic steps (in terms of QTL substitutions) separating the parental species phenotypes; (2) trait correlations; and (3) the potential for transgressive segregation in hybrid populations. Results indicate that some Louisiana Iris floral trait QTL have large effects and QTL for different traits tend to colocalize. Transgressive variation was observed for six of nine traits, despite the fact that mixed QTL effects influence few traits. Overall, our QTL results imply that the genetic basis of floral morphology and color traits might facilitate the maintenance of phenotypic divergence between Iris fulva and Iris brevicaulis, although a great deal of phenotypic variation was observed among hybrids.",M2

A subset of 16-day-old seedlings was exposed to 1000 mg l(-1) Cd to characterize sub-cellular localization of Cd in root cells. The Cd contents in the shoots of I. lactea var. chinensis reached 529 microg g(-1 )dry weight (dw) at 80 mg l(-1) Cd treatment and in the shoots of I. tectorum reached 232 microg g(-1) dw at 40 mg l(-1) Cd treatment, without showing signs of visible toxicity.

17591610,"Parental origin and genome evolution in the allopolyploid <e>Iris</e> versicolor.BACKGROUND AIMS: One of the classic examples of an allopolyploid is Iris versicolor, 'Blue Flag' (2n = 108), first studied by Edgar Anderson and later popularized by George Ledyard Stebbins in cytogenetics and evolutionary text-books. It is revisited here using modern molecular and cytogenetic tools to investigate its putative allopolyploid origin involving progenitors of I. virginica (2n = 70) and I. setosa (2n = 38). METHODS: Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern hybridization with 5S and 18-26S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) probes were used to identify the parental origin of chromosomes, and to study the unit structure, relative abundance and chromosomal location of rDNA sequences. KEY RESULTS: GISH shows that I. versicolor has inherited the sum of the chromosome complement from the two progenitor species. In I. versicolor all the 18-26S rDNA units and loci are inherited from the progenitor of I. virginica, those loci from the I. setosa progenitor are absent. In contrast 5S rDNA loci and units from both progenitors are found, although one of the two 5S loci expected from the I. setosa progenitor is absent. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm Anderson's hypothesis that I. versicolor is an allopolyploid involving progenitors of I. virginica and I. setosa. The number of 18-26S rDNA loci in I. versicolor is similar to that of progenitor I. virginica, suggestive of a first stage in genome diploidization. The locus loss is targeted at the I. setosa-origin subgenome, and this is discussed in relation to other polyploidy systems.",M2

IhOMT1 encodes an open reading frame (ORF) of 365 amino acids with calculated molecular mass of 40,193Da and isoelectric point (pI) of 5.54, while IhOMT2, which shares 31.5% amino acid sequence identity with IhOMT1, encodes 369 amino acids with calculated molecular mass of 40,385Da and pI of 5.50. In addition, the molecular masses of both recombinant IhOMT1 and IhOMT2 proteins were estimated to be about 40kDa by protein gel blot analysis. Characterization of the enzymatic properties using the recombinant IhOMT1 protein confirmed that IhOMT1 cDNA encodes a S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent caffeic acid 3-OMT, which catalyzes the transfer of the methyl moiety from SAM to caffeic acid to form ferulic acid. Its optimum activity was observed at pH 7.5-8.0 and at 35 degrees C. This is the first report of the isolation and characterization of a COMT cDNA clone involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis of Iridaceae plants. In contrast, IhOMT2 showed no activity in SAM-dependent assays for various phenylpropanoids.",M2
17237511,"The genetic architecture of reproductive isolation in Louisiana irises: flowering phenology.Despite the potential importance of divergent reproductive phenologies as a barrier to gene flow, we know less about the genetics of this factor than we do about any other isolating barrier. Here, we report on the genetic architecture of divergent flowering phenologies that result in substantial reproductive isolation between the naturally hybridizing plant species <e>Iris</e> fulva and I. brevicaulis. I. fulva initiates and terminates flowering significantly earlier than I. brevicaulis. We examined line crosses of reciprocal F1 and backcross (BC1) hybrids and determined that flowering time was polygenic in nature. We further defined quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect the initiation of flowering in each of these species. QTL analyses were performed separately for two different growing seasons in the greenhouse, as well as in two field plots where experimental plants were placed into nature. For BCIF hybrids (BC1 toward I. fulva), 14 of 17 detected QTL caused flowering to occur later in the season when I. brevicaulis alleles were present, while the remaining 3 caused flowering to occur earlier. In BCIB hybrids (BC1 toward I. brevicaulis), 11 of 15 detected QTL caused flowering to occur earlier in the season when introgressed I. fulva alleles were present, while the remaining 4 caused flowering to occur later. These ratios are consistent with expectations of selection (as opposed to drift) promoting flowering divergence in the evolutionary history of these species. Furthermore, epistatic interactions among the QTL also reflected the same trends, with the majority of epistatic effects causing later flowering than expected in BCIF hybrids and earlier flowering in BCIB hybrids. Overlapping QTL that influenced flowering time across all four habitat/treatment types were not detected, indicating that increasing the sample size of genotyped plants would likely increase the number of significant QTL found in this study.",M2

17087976,"Systematic tuning of parameters in support vector clustering.Clustering algorithms divide a set of observations into groups so that members of the same group share common features. In most of the algorithms, tunable parameters are set arbitrarily or by trial and error, resulting in less than optimal clustering. This paper presents a global optimization strategy for the systematic and optimal selection of parameter values associated with a clustering method. In the process, a performance criterion for the optimization model is proposed and benchmarked against popular performance criteria from the literature (namely, the Silhouette coefficient, Dunn's index, and Davies-Bouldin index). The tuning strategy is illustrated using the support vector clustering (SVC) algorithm and simulated annealing. In order to reduce the computational burden, the paper also proposes an alternative to the adjacency matrix method (used for the assignment of cluster labels), namely the contour plotting approach. Datasets tested include the <e>iris</e> and the thyroid datasets from the UCI repository, as well as lymphoma and breast cancer data. The optimal tuning parameters are determined efficiently, while the contour plotting approach leads to significant reductions in computational effort (CPU time) especially for large datasets. The performance criteria comparisons indicate mixed results. Specifically, the Silhouette coefficient and the Davies-Bouldin index perform better, while the Dunn's index is worse on average than the proposed performance index.",M2
16678908,"An efficient way of high-contrast, quasi-3D cellular imaging: off-axis illumination.An imaging system enabling a convenient visualisation of cells and other small objects is presented. It represents an adaptation of the optical microscope condenser, accommodating a built-in edge (relief) diaphragm brought close to the condenser <e>iris</e> diaphragm and enabling high-contrast pseudo-relief (quasi-3D) imaging. The device broadens the family of available apparatus based on the off-axis (or anaxial, asymmetric, inclined, oblique, schlieren-type, sideband) illumination. The simplicity of the design makes the condenser a user-friendly, dedicated device delivering high-contrast quasi-3D images of phase objects. Those are nearly invisible under the ordinary (axial) illumination. The phase contrast microscopy commonly used in visualisation of phase objects does not deliver the quasi-3D effect and introduces a disturbing 'halo' effect around the edges. The performance of the device presented here is demonstrated on living cells and tissue replicas. High-contrast quasi-3D images of cell-free preparations of biological origin (paper fibres and microcrystals) are shown as well.",M2

Activity-guided fractionation revealed that the chloroform extract showed the highest molluscicidal activity (LC90 = 1.26 mg/l) among the tested extracts of the rhizomes. Fraction B prepared from the chloroform extract was the most potent molluscicide (LC90 = 0.96 mg/l) in addition, it showed a significant heart rate reduction in the snail after a 6- to 24-h exposure period. It also displayed a significant level of cercaricidal potential in a time-concentration relationship pattern. Chromatographic fractionation and purification of fraction B resulted in the isolation of two novel compounds: 5,2'-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-6,7-methylenedioxyflavone and 5,7,2'-trihydroxy-6-methoxyflavanone.

Naturally growing I. pumila clones revealed significant SA that were positive on small distances and negative on medium ones in both open Hillock and shaded Woodland populations. No significant SA were detected when calculated with original clone positions, but with morphometric data from replants into the experimental plot in the same habitat. Some significant SA were, however, detected when morphometric data from transplants to alternative habitat were used. Detected SA on I. pumila clones were primarilly a consequence of spatial structuring of environmental factors but also, in lesser degree, a result of genetic spatial arrangements (most probably due to patterns of gene flow).",M2
16415358,"Detecting adaptive trait introgression between <e>Iris</e> fulva and I. brevicaulis in highly selective field conditions.The idea that natural hybridization has served as an important force in evolutionary and adaptive diversification has gained considerable momentum in recent years. By combining genome analyses with a highly selective field experiment, we provide evidence for adaptive trait introgression between two naturally hybridizing Louisiana Iris species, flood-tolerant Iris fulva and dry-adapted I. brevicaulis. We planted reciprocal backcross (BC1) hybrids along with pure-species plants into natural settings that, due to a flooding event, favored I. fulva. As expected, I. fulva plants survived at much higher rates than I. brevicaulis plants. Backcross hybrids toward I. fulva (BCIF) also survived at significantly higher rates than the reciprocal backcross toward I. brevicaulis (BCIB). Survivorship of BCIB hybrids was strongly influenced by the presence of a number of introgressed I. fulva alleles located throughout the genome, while survivorship in the reciprocal BCIF hybrids was heavily influenced by two epistatically acting QTL of opposite effects. These results demonstrate the potential for adaptive trait introgression between these two species and may help to explain patterns of genetic variation observed in naturally occurring hybrid zones.",M2
16405157,"Loci affecting long-term hybrid survivorship in Louisiana irises: implications for reproductive isolation and introgression.<e>Iris</e> fulva and I. brevicaulis are long-lived plant species known to hybridize where they coexist in nature. Year-to-year survival contributes significantly to overall fitness for both species and their hybrid derivatives, and differences in hybrid survivability may have important consequences to interspecific gene flow in nature. We examined the genetic architecture of long-term survivorship of reciprocal backcross I. fulva x I. brevicaulis hybrids in a common-garden, greenhouse environment. Differences in mortality were found between the two backcross (BC1) hybrid classes, with hybrids crossed toward I. fulva (BCIF) revealing twice the mortality of those hybrids backcrossed toward I. brevicaulis (BCIB). Using genomic scans on two separate genetic linkage maps derived from the reciprocal hybrid populations, we found that hybrid survivorship is influenced by several genetic regions. Multiple interval mapping (MIM) revealed four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in BCIF hybrids that were significantly associated with survivorship. Introgressed I. brevicaulis DNA increased survivorship at three of the four QTLs. For the fourth QTL, introgressed I. brevicaulis DNA was associated with decreased survivorship. No QTLs were detected in BCIB hybrids; however, single-marker analysis revealed five unlinked loci that were significantly associated with survivorship. At all five markers, survivorship was positively associated with introgressed I. fulva DNA. The present findings have important implications for the evolutionary dynamics of naturally occurring hybrid zones. Regions of the genome that increase survivorship when in a heterozygous (i.e., hybrid) state should have an increased likelihood of passing across species boundaries, whereas those that decrease survivorship will be less likely to introgress.",M2
16205954,"Morning floral heat as a reward to the pollinators of the Oncocyclus irises.Relationships between flowering plants and their pollinators are usually affected by the amount of reward, mainly pollen or nectar, offered to pollinators by flowers, with these amounts usually positively correlated with floral display. The large Oncocyclus <e>iris</e> flowers, despite being the largest flowers in the East Mediterranean flora, are nectarless and have hidden pollen. No pollinators visit the flowers during daytime, and these flowers are pollinated only by night-sheltering solitary male bees. These iris flowers are partially or fully dark-colored, suggesting that they gather heat by absorbing solar radiation. Here we test the hypothesis that the dark-colored flowers of the Oncocyclus irises offer heat reward to their male solitary bee pollinators. Floral temperature was higher by 2.5 degrees C than ambient air after sunrise. Solitary male bees emerged earlier after sheltering in Oncocyclus flowers than from other experimental shelter types. Pollination tunnels facing east towards the rising sun hosted more male bees than other aspects. We suggest that floral heat reward can explain the evolution of dark floral colors in Oncocyclus irises, mediated by the pollinators' behavior.",M2
16079236,"Genetic mapping of species boundaries in Louisiana irises using IRRE retrotransposon display markers.Genetic mapping studies provide insight into the pattern and extent of genetic incompatibilities affecting hybridization between closely related species.

Linkage mapping analyses indicated very little genetic incompatibility between I. fulva and I. brevicaulis in the form of map regions exhibiting transmission ratio distortion, and this was confirmed using a Bayesian multipoint mapping analysis. These results demonstrate the utility of transposon-based marker systems for genetic mapping studies of wild plant species and indicate that the genomes of I. fulva and I. brevicaulis are highly permeable to gene flow and introgression from one another via backcrossing.",M2

Transgenic lines carrying each of the transgenes were confirmed for integration into the tomato genome using Southern blot hybridization. Transcription of I-RIP, M-GLU, and Mj-AMP1 genes in various transgenic lines was determined using Northern blot analysis. Plants of selected transgenic lines were inoculated with a 2-3x10(4) conidial spores/ml suspension of the fungal pathogen Alternaria solani, the causal agent of tomato early blight. Compared to control (non-transformed) plants, two transgenic lines carrying either a M-GLU or Mj-AMP1 showed enhanced resistance to early blight disease.

16025415,"Pollination of Oncocyclus irises (<e>Iris</e>: Iridaceae) by night-sheltering male bees.Irises in the section Oncocyclus (Siems.) Baker ( IRIS: Iridaceae) grow throughout the Middle East and have large and dark-coloured flowers but no nectar reward available to flower visitors. Consequently, no reward-collecting pollinators have been observed visiting the flowers during daytime. The only visitors are solitary male bees ( Eucera spp.: Apidae) that enter the flowers at dusk and stay there overnight. Here we describe the mating system of Oncocyclus irises, and the role of night-sheltering male bees in their pollination system. Pollen viability in I. haynei on Mt. Gilboa was very high (&gt;90%) throughout all floral life stages. Stigmas were receptive in buds and in open flowers, but not in older ones. Self-pollination yielded no fruits in three species, confirming complete self-incompatibility in Oncocyclus irises. On average, 1.9 flowers were visited by each male bee before it settled for the night in the last one. Moreover, Iris pollen was present on the dorsal side of 38.8% of males caught sheltering in flower models mounted near an I. atrofusca population, indicating that pollen is transferred between flowers by night-sheltering solitary male bees. We have surveyed 13 flowering populations of six Oncocyclus species for the presence of night-sheltering male bees as well as for fruit set. We found a positive correlation, indicating that sexual reproduction in Oncocyclus irises is dependent on night-sheltering solitary male bees. Based on their complete self-incompatibility, the absence of nectar-collecting visitors during the day, and the transfer of pollen grains by the night-sheltering solitary male bees, we conclude that fertilization of Oncocyclus irises is totally dependent on pollination by night-sheltering solitary male bees.",M2

Organogenesis through direct formation of shoots from explants, callogenesis, and floral organogenesis were demonstrated in I. ensata callus culture in vitro. These processes depended on the plant species and on the content of phytohormones in the medium. Adventitious shoots proved to develop on the basal part of the perianth tube and on the apical part of the ovary, while roots were not formed. Direct organogenesis was induced by the following phytohormones: alpha-naphthylacetic acid and 6-benzylaminopurine for I. ensata and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 6-benzylaminopurine for I. setosa and I. sanguinea; while callogenesis was induced by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid.

15720658,"Delay of <e>Iris</e> flower senescence by protease inhibitors.Visible senescence of the flag tepals in Iris x hollandica (cv. Blue Magic) was preceded by a large increase in endoprotease activity. Just before visible senescence about half of total endoprotease activity was apparently due to cysteine proteases, somewhat less than half to serine proteases, with a minor role of metalloproteases. Treatment of isolated tepals with the purported serine protease inhibitors AEBSF [4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride] or DFP (diisopropyl-fluorophosphate) prevented the increase in endoprotease activity and considerably delayed or prevented the normal senescence symptoms. The specific cysteine protease-specific E-64d reduced maximum endoprotease activity by 30%, but had no effect on the time to visible senescence. Zinc chloride and aprotinin reduced maximum endoprotease activity by c. 50 and 40%, respectively, and slightly delayed visible senescence. A proteasome inhibitor (Z-leu-leu-Nva-H) slightly delayed tepal senescence, which indicates that protein degradation in the proteasome may play a role in induction of the visible senescence symptoms. It is concluded that visible senescence is preceded by large-scale protein degradation, which is apparently mainly due to cysteine- and serine protease activity, and that two (unspecific) inhibitors of serine proteases considerably delay the senescence symptoms.",M2

Samsun NN) plants and challenging the transgenic plants with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Although constitutive expression of IRAb resulted in an aberrant phenotype, the plants were fertile. Transgenic tobacco lines expressing IRAb showed a dose-dependent enhanced resistance against TMV infection but the level of protection was markedly lower than in plants expressing IRIP, the type-1 RIP from Iris that closely resembles the A-chain of IRAb. To verify whether IRIP or IRAb can also confer systemic protection against viruses, transgenic RIP-expressing scions were grafted onto control rootstocks and leaves of the rootstocks challenged with tobacco etch virus (TEV). In spite of the strong local antiviral effect of IRIP and IRAb the RIPs could not provide systemic protection against TEV. Hence our results demonstrate that expression of the type-1 and type-2 RIPs from Iris confers tobacco plants local protection against two unrelated viruses. The antiviral activity of both RIPs was not accompanied by an induction of pathogenesis-related proteins. It is suggested that the observed antiviral activity of both Iris RIPs relies on their RNA N-glycohydrolase activity towards TMV RNA and plant rRNA.",M2

Compounds 1 and 2 are new, while compounds 3 and 4 are known isoflavone glycosides. These compounds were identified as iriskashmirianin 4'-O-beta-D-glucoside (1), nigricin 4'-O-beta-D-glucoside (2), irilone 4'-O-beta-D-glucoside (3) and iridin (4). Their structures were determined with the help of spectroscopic methods.",M2

Professor Blaauw) have been isolated and cloned. Both lectins, called Iris agglutinin b and Iris agglutinin r, possess N-glycosidase activity and share a high sequence similarity with previously described type 2 ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP). However, these lectins show only 57% to 59% sequence identity to a previously characterized type 1 RIP from iris, called IRIP. The identification of the iris lectins as type 2 RIP provides unequivocal evidence for the simultaneous occurrence of type 1 and type 2 RIP in iris bulbs and allowed a detailed comparison of type 1 and type 2 RIP from a single plant, which provides further insight into the molecular evolution of RIP. Binding studies and docking experiments revealed that the lectins exhibit binding activity not only toward Gal/N-acetylgalactosamine, but also toward mannose, demonstrating for the first time that RIP-binding sites can accommodate mannose.",M2
