20345198,"A case of recurrent herpes zoster leg paresis without rash.Acute herpes zoster neuralgia is a benign infection affecting the sensory part of the nervous system with a painful vesicular <e>eruption</e>. The authors report a case of a 48-year-old woman patient with right leg paresis followed by herpetic rash. Needle electromyography revealed pathologic findings while lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no pathologic findings. The patient was managed with strengthening exercises as well as pain relief for neuralgia. The potential role of antiviral pharmacotherapy in such a case is discussed. The authors describe this case because zoster paresis should be one of the differential diagnoses of girdle muscle weakness and because the rash followed the leg paresis. The clinical implications of the case are discussed, since the patient presented from time to time with relapses of the disease without prominent rash.",M1
20233573,"Letter: Adult measles with a butterfly rash-like appearance.Butterfly rash is characterized by symmetrical erythema and erythematous papules and plaques grouped on the bilateral cheeks and nose, commonly found in lupus erythematosus. Measles is a highly contagious viral disease, characterized by high fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and Koplik spots, which precede generalized maculo-papular rashes. We report an adult case of measles, accompanied by butterfly rash. A 20-year-old woman came to our hospital with a butterfly rash-like <e>eruption</e> on the face, high fever, and arthralgia. The eruption had appeared on the nose and both cheeks three days before admission. The oral mucosa was not involved. On the basis of the three criteria for a diagnosis of lupus eruthematosus, we first made a tentative diagnosis of lupus eruthematosus and performed blood tests. However, anti-DNA antibodies, scl-70, anti-Ro and La, anti-Sm and rheumatoid factor were all negative. Two days after admission, a Koplik macule appeared along with multiple erythematous macules and papules that were scattered through the trunk. Laboratory tests were positive for anti-measles immunoglobulin M and G. Therefore, we reached a diagnosis of measles. Within a week, all of the clinical symptoms disappeared. Physicians should be aware that, in rare cases, measles may present with a butterfly-like rash.",M1

19780771,"Usefulness of skin testing in cutaneous drug <e>eruptions</e> in routine practice.BACKGROUND: Cutaneous drug eruptions are common side-effects. The imputation score combining intrinsic (chronology, clinical and paraclinical signs) and extrinsic criteria used in Pharmacovigilance Centres is insufficient alone to identify with certainty a responsible drug. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the imputation score before and after performing skin testing in patients with cutaneous drug eruptions. PATIENTS/METHODS: A single-centre retrospective study was performed on 339 patients tested between 2001-2006. Imputation scores were calculated before and after skin tests for each cutaneous drug eruption according to the clinical type of skin eruption and the type of drug. RESULTS: Among 121 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 46% showed an increase of the imputation score as shown by 25/41 cases of maculo-papular exanthema, 4/11 cases of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and 17/41 cases of urticaria/anaphylaxis. The imputation score increased in 25/70 cases of the tested antibiotic drugs, in 14/56 cases of cardiovascular drugs, and it increased in 19 patients (34%) with I1 or I2 imputation scores before skin testing and in 29 (52%) with an I3 imputation score before skin testing. CONCLUSIONS: Drug skin testing appeared useful in investigating cutaneous drug eruptions in routine practice, including not only drugs with a high imputation score (I3) but also those with a lower score (I1, I2). Drug skin testing should lead to oral rechallenge of drugs with negative tests in order to determine which drugs may be used safely.",M1

19689519,"Blueberry muffin rash as the presenting sign of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.A 36-week gestation singleton male infant was born with hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, microcephaly, and a generalized <e>eruption</e> of bluish-red nonblanching macules and papules. Head computed tomography showed intracranial calcifications and enlarged ventricles. Skin biopsy was consistent with extramedullary hematopoiesis, with no evidence of neoplastic infiltrate. Family history was notable for parental consanguinity and twin sisters with the diagnosis of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive progressive encephalopathy. Although the infant's clinical presentation at birth suggested an infectious etiology, extensive testing for infection, including TORCH titers, was negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed persistent lymphocytosis and an elevated interferon alpha level, consistent with the diagnosis of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Although there have been no reported cases of a blueberry muffin rash in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, it is biologically plausible for this cutaneous manifestation to occur in the setting of a genetic condition that mimics the clinical phenotype of a congenital viral infection. As the capacity to test for different infectious etiologies and genetic syndromes increases, so must the differential diagnosis of a neonatal blueberry muffin rash. It is important to identify these rare syndromes because of their prognostic implications, risk of recurrence with future pregnancies and need for prompt genetic counseling.",M1
19514925,"Severe cutaneous reaction to cetuximab with possible association with the use of over-the-counter skin care products in a patient with oropharyngeal cancer.BACKGROUND: The management of locally advanced head and neck cancer remains a challenge to most oncologists and their patients. Treatment with epithelial growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) is associated with a good response. Cetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), in combination with radiation therapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Although a mild acneiform skin rash (Grade 1, 2) is very common in these patients, severe rash (Grade 3) is uncommon. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old African American man with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer was treated with cetuximab and radiation. He developed a sudden flare-up of a skin rash after the 5th cycle of cetuximab following use of over-the-counter (OTC) skin care remedies. The rash manifested with severe maculopapular <e>eruption</e> and erythematous rash, along with desquamation and exfoliation of the skin, mainly on the face and neck area. The patient denied any extraordinary sun exposure. Cetuximab and radiation therapy were held for 1 week and the rash was treated with doxycycline, diphenhydramine, and continued use of natural emollient (Vaseline petroleum jelly). After 1 week, a dramatic improvement of the facial rash was noticed. DISCUSSION: Our report describes a sudden flare-up of a skin rash (Grade 3) after the 5th cycle of cetuximab following use of OTC skin care remedies, which was unusual for this patient, suggesting a possible relation to the therapy. Skin crucially depends on EGFR for its normal function and becomes extremely sensitive during cetuximab therapy. Topical OTC acne and dry skin remedies can suddenly change the mild acneiform rash into severe skin toxicity associated with marked desquamation and exfoliation. Avoidance of further skin damage caused by topical applications and the use of doxycycline and diphenhydramine show a significant success in the management of skin toxicity.",M1
19502983,"An update on pityriasis rosea and other similar childhood exanthems.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pityriasis rosea is a common skin condition seen in children and adults. Whereas pityriasis rosea is a benign condition, it is important to distinguish it from other childhood exanthems. RECENT FINDINGS: Pityriasis rosea can present in a variety of manners. Most often a herald patch precedes the generalized <e>eruption</e>, although this is not always the case. Pityriasis rosea may lead to undesirable outcomes when affecting pregnant women. Guttate psoriasis, secondary syphilis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, capillaritis, pityriasis versicolor, nummular eczema, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are important to consider in the differential diagnosis of pityriasis rosea. SUMMARY: Pityriasis rosea is self-limiting, usually lasting 1-3 months. Treatment may be considered in certain cases, although there is a paucity of medical studies supporting any definitive treatment. However, treatment may be warranted for other conditions that mimic pityriasis rosea.",M1

19442802,"[Bortezomib-induced neutrophilic dermatosis with CD30+ lymphocytic infiltration]BACKGROUND: Bortezomib (Velcade) is a proteasome used in the treatment of myeloma. It is associated with a number of adverse cutaneous effects, often described as papulonodular rash on the upper half of the body. We report a new case characterised by the presence of CD30+ lymphocytic infiltrate in the lesions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 62-year-old woman receiving six courses of bortezomib for stage IIIA IgA myeloma presented a skin <e>eruption</e> during the second course of treatment that involved rounded papular or papulonodular elements on the upper body. Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy sample showed clinical picture reminiscent of Sweet's syndrome but including a significant number of CD30+ lymphocytes. The skin rash recurred to a greater or lesser degree during subsequent courses of therapy, but it was not necessary to discontinue the treatment. Symptoms subsided after the final course of bortezomib. DISCUSSION: Skin eruptions with bortezomib are a common occurrence but generally do not prevent continuation of treatment. While they have given rise to a variety of histopathological pictures, clinical settings such as those seen with our patient appear common. In terms of histopathology, the rash is reminiscent of Sweet's syndrome but our case differed in terms of the presence of CD30+ infiltrate. The latter may be compared with reactional infiltrates of the same type seen during use of other treatments for malignant blood diseases. The underlying mechanism is poorly understood.",M1

The clinical findings were compatible with so-called symmetrical drug related intertriginous and flexural exanthema, also known as Baboon syndrome. Although epicutaneous patch testing with the offending drug was negative, drug rechallenge produced a recurrence of the skin findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of symmetrical drug related intertriginous and flexural exanthema reported due to risperidone.",M1
19307779,"Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) triggered by a spider bite.BACKGROUND: Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a rare and severe cutaneous reaction usually triggered by drugs. Other causative factors such as viral infections are rarely involved. In this study, we report a case of AGEP caused by a spider bite. CASE SUMMARY: A 56-year-old woman was referred to the allergy unit after a spider bite at the left popliteal fossa, while gardening, 5 days earlier. The offending spider was captured and identified by an entomologist as belonging to the Loxosceles rufescens species. No acute reaction was observed; however, after 24 hours, due to the occurrence of typical dermonecrotic skin lesions associated with erythema and edema, Cefuroxime and Clindamycin were administered intramuscularly after medical advice was given. Almost 72 hours after the spider bite, an erythematous and partly edematous <e>eruption</e> appeared locally in the gluteus area bilaterally, which progressively expanded to the trunk, arms and femors. Within 24 hours dozens of small, pinhead sized, non-follicular pustules were present, mainly in the folds. The patient complained of a burning sensation of the skin in addition to pruritus; and simultaneously had a fever of 38-39 degrees C as the eruption expanded. DISCUSSION: A spider bite may represent a possible causative factor of AGEP. A spider's venom contains sphingomyelinase that stimulates the release of IL8 and GM-CSF, which are involved in AGEP pathogenesis. Whether or not the con-current use of antibiotics has an effect in AGEP appearance when combined with a spider's venom, cannot be excluded.",M1
19261012,"Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis: report of 12 cases and literature review.BACKGROUND: Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is an acute pustular <e>eruption</e> occurring after infection and/or drug ingestion, with spontaneous cure after a single eruption. AIM: To communicate a series of cases of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on cases of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, observed between 1993 and 2006 at the Dermatology Department, Hospital General de Occidente, Jalisco, Mexico. RESULTS: Twelve patients were included, with a predominance of male patients and a mean age of 28 years. The most common cause was drugs, detected in 83% of cases, and most of these were a result of anticonvulsants and antimicobials. The most frequent symptoms were itching, present in all cases, and fever, present in 92% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is considered to be a distinct clinical and histopathologic entity. Because of its self-resolving character, early recognition can help to avoid unnecessary diagnostic studies and treatments.",M1

Interestingly, this patient also exhibited a pseudoisomorphic Köebner response.

18833041,"Terbinafine-induced acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal agent, effective in the treatment of dermatomycoses. Many cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported (in about 3% of treated patients). Furthermore terbinafine has been associated with pustular <e>eruptions</e>, as well as the induction and exacerbation of pre-existing psoriasis and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). AGEP is an uncommon aseptic pustular eruption, classified for many years as a pustular psoriasis, that usually follows recent administration of oral or parenteral drugs. The disease is most frequently triggered by antibiotics, most of all aminopenicillins and macrolides. Characteristic AGEP features include the sudden onset of fever above 38 C with widespread erythematous eruption, rapidly progressing to a fine, non-follicular, micropustular rash. Leucocytosis is generally present, sometimes associated with eosinophilia. The illness usually resolves spontaneously with the fever and the pustulation clearing within 15 days, sometimes followed by desquamation. Hystopathology shows non-follicular spongiotic pustules in the epidermis filled with neutrophils, a mixed perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils and occasional eosinophils with papillary dermal oedema. On this subject, Sideroff et al. recently elaborated a validation score based on morphology, histological criteria, and disease course. The pathogenetic mechanism which leads to the induction of AGEP by some medicines has still not been clarified, but T cells seem to play a crucial role. The authors report a case of a patient with terbinafine-induced AGEP and a review of the literature about this topic. The case illustrates once again the role of terbinafine in AGEP and reminds us that early diagnosis of AGEP is important to avoid unnecessary investigations and/or the administration of antibiotics.",M1

Rarely, a localized variant of this pustular reaction called  acute localized exanthematous pustulosis  has been described. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 29-year-old woman sought treatment at the authors' dermatology clinic for an outbreak of numerous superficial, nonfollicular pustules with an underlying erythematous base that was accompanied by subjective fever. The lesions appeared two days after the patient began taking amoxicillin prescribed for endocarditis prophylaxis before she underwent a dental cleaning. Cultures were negative for bacteria, and the eruption resolved within four days after the patient discontinued the drug therapy. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Newly revised guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis indicate that adverse reactions far outweigh the benefits in most cases. It is important that general dentists and oral surgeons recognize this rare pustular eruption, because antibiotics, particularly amoxicillin, are the primary inciting agents. In addition, health professionals should make clinical choices based on evidence, weigh the risks of any treatment plan against its benefits and practice caution when prescribing any drug.",M1

Due to increasing indications for the administration of itraconazole its increased usage as well as the possibility of allergic reactions should be expected even if these are a rare event.",M1
18718560,"Clinical and genetic aspects of Blau syndrome: a 25-year follow-up of one family and a literature review.Blau syndrome (BS) is a rare familial disease transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, characterized by arthritis, uveitis, skin rash and granulomatous inflammation. Until now BS has been observed in 136 persons belonging to 28 families as well as in 4 sporadic cases. The gene responsible for BS has recently been identified in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of caspase recruitment domain (CARD15/NOD2), also involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. In addition to three missense mutations (R334Q, R334W and L469F) previously identified, a new CARD 15 mutation (E383K) has recently been described in a family followed by us for the past 25 years. The characteristics of this family which, to our knowledge, is the only one affected with BS in Italy, are the object of this manuscript. Both the proband and her daughter were originally affected with a papulonodular skin <e>eruption</e> and then with mild arthritis of the hands and feet. The proband, but not the daughter, complained of severe chronic bilateral uveitis, followed by glaucoma and, a few years later, by cataracts. Histological examination of skin biopsies from both subjects and a joint biopsy (daughter only), showed non-caseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells which, at electron microscopy, revealed  comma-shaped bodies  in epithelioid cells, thought to be a marker for BS. The disease is presently well controlled with low doses of prednisone for the mother and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) plus low doses of prednisone, when necessary, for the daughter. As in Crohn's disease, CARD15/NOD2 mutation is believed to be responsible for the granulomatous autoinflammatory reactions probably triggered by microorganisms in BS.",M1

18717872,"Carbamazepine-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome: report of four cases and brief review.Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a rare but severe drug reaction, most commonly to aromatic anticonvulsants with a delayed onset, variable clinical presentation and protracted course. The exact incidence of DRESS syndrome is not known because of the variability in clinical presentation, lack of strict diagnostic criteria and universally accepted nomenclature. We report four cases of DRESS syndrome associated with the use of carbamazepine. The clinical manifestation was similar: a maculopapular <e>eruption</e> progressing to exfoliative erythroderma, fever, and lymphadenopathy. Leukocytosis, atypical lymphocytes and liver injury (in 2 patients) were also observed. Assessment of causality using the Naranjo algorithm established a  probable  relationship with carbamazepine in three of the cases and a  possible  relationship in one case. Detection of DRESS syndrome is dependent on the exclusion of a variety of diseases with similar manifestations and may be delayed in time. DRESS syndrome is a potentially life-threatening multisystem adverse drug reaction, and accidental reexposure or drug provocation tests must be avoided.",M1
18706172,"[Clinical analysis of childhood acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis]OBJECTIVE: To describe the etiology, clinical features and treatment of childhood acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). METHODS: Clinical data from 20 cases of childhood acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis from 1990 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Eighteen cases had a history of medication, including the use of penicillin (n=6), cephalosporins (n=3), sulphonamides (n=2), algopyrin (n=2), vaccines (n=2 ) and anti-cold drugs (n=3). Fever and generalized erythematous pustules were observed in all 20 cases. Histopathologic examination revealed spongiform superficial pustules and papillary edema. The patients were asked to stop taking suspected sensitizing drugs and received glucocorticoid treatment (1-2 mg/kg daily). After 3-5 days of the treatment, symptoms were improved and the dosage of glucocorticoid was gradually reduced. All patients were healed within 20 days after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The cause of AGEP is mainly attributed to the use of antibiotics, sulphonamides, antipyretic analgesics and vaccines in children. AGEP is characterized by fever and widespread pustular <e>eruption</e> of the skin. Removal of sensitizing factors and glucocorticoid administration is important in the treatment of AGEP in children.",M1
18705448,"Two years review of cutaneous adverse drug reaction from first line anti-tuberculous drugs.First line Anti-TB therapy with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol/streptomycin is very effective. However, major adverse reactions to antituberculous drugs can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Cutaneous adverse drug reaction (CADR) is one of the commonly observed major adverse events. This retrospective study looked at the cases of TB treated in Respiratory Unit, Penang Hospital from January 2004 to December 2005. Of 820 patients treated for active TB, 47 patients (25 females; 22 males) developed CADR (5.7%). CADRs observed include morbiliform rash (72.3%), erythema multiforme syndrome (8.5%), urticaria (8.5%) and others (which include exfoliative dermatitis and lichenoid <e>eruption</e>). Ninety-seven percent of events occurred within two months after the initial dose. Incidence rate of CADR among the first line anti-TB drugs, pyrazinamide was the commonest offending drug (2.38%), followed by streptomycin (1.45%), ethambutol (1.44%), rifampicin (1.23%) and isoniazid (0.98%). Various clinical characteristics of patients with CADR identified include Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (27.7%), polypharmacy (21.3%), elderly (19.1%), autoimmune disorders (6.4%), pre-existing renal impairment (4.3%), pre-existing liver disorders (4.3%). In conclusion, CADR is common and majority of cases occurred within two months after initiation of anti-TB treatment, particularly in HIV infected patients.

As he had frequent convulsive fits, carbamazepine (CBZ) was added. Thirty-four days later, the patient developed hyperthermia, (39.5 degrees C), cervical lymphadenopathy and generalized cutaneous exfoliated maculae and papulae. Biochemical investigation was characterized by a white cell count of 16.1 x 103/microl (17% eosinophils) and increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (50 and 116 IU/L, respectively). HHV6 serological tests performed on day 21, detected anti HHV6 IgM, suggesting a HHV6 primary infection. Hence, CBZ was discontinued. One month later, the skin <e>eruption</e>, fever, lymph node swelling, liver dysfunction, and eosinophilia were progressively relieved.

Warfarin was then used without skin reaction. Subsequent patch-tests were positive for fluindione. DISCUSSION: These signs were consistent with fluindione-induced acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis. A causative role of fluindione is very likely in view of the rapid onset after initiation, improvement after withdrawal and positive patch tests. Skin patch-testing, which is easily performed, can be extremely helpful in determining a causal relationship with medication.",M1

These lesions were referred to as  aching . The patient had been taking amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (3 g a day) over the past three days for oral prophylaxis for dental treatment. Given the possible allergic reaction to the drug administered and the extension of the pustular lesions over all face and neck during the following four days, we replaced the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with another antibiotic with wide range (ciprofloxacin). Resolution of the pustular lesions occurred within ten days and was accompanied by light scarring and pigmentation. On the basis of the close relationship between the administration of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and the development of the disease, in combination with a rapid, acute resolution as soon as this treatment was interrupted, and all the histologic findings, we consider this to be an unusual type of acute generalized pustular <e>eruption</e> (AGEP) recently defined as acute localized pustular eruption (ALEP) due to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.",M1
18097229,"Can response of a pruritic papular <e>eruption</e> to antiretroviral therapy be used as a clinical parameter to monitor virological outcome?BACKGROUND: A pruritic papular eruption (PPE) is a common skin manifestation observed in 12-46% of persons with HIV infection living in tropical countries. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether PPE responds to HAART and whether monitoring PPE severity could be used as a clinical marker to predict virological outcome in resource-limited settings where viral load testing is not available. METHODS: The study enrolled 53 patients with PPE for at least 1 month before starting a first-line HAART regimen as part of a prospective study. CD4 cell count and viral load were measured at enrolment and every 3 months. A scoring system was developed to evaluate the PPE severity by asking two questions. Over the last month how itchy has your skin been? Over the last month how has itching interfered with your sleep? RESULTS: Median CD4 cell count was 15 cells/mul and median viral load 268 663 copies/ml. All patients initiated a regimen containing a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Mean PPE score declined from 3.9 at enrolment to 0.1 at 24 months. In 37 (86%) of the 43 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up data, the PPE disappeared and never returned. Patients with viral load &gt; 400 copies/ml at months 9 and/or 12 had significantly higher PPE scores at months 9 to 12 than the patients with &lt; 400 copies/ml. CONCLUSIONS: In most patients, PPE disappears during HAART and PPE severity scores were higher in patients whose first-line HAART failed to control plasma viral load.",M1

We demonstrate the clinical characteristics of segmental zoster paresis by reviewing the cases of 138 patients, including 3 of our patients. CASE REPORT AND REVIEW SUMMARY: We report 3 patients with zoster paresis of the limbs. Patients 1 and 3 showed motor weakness in the left shoulder and arm after developing a herpetic rash in the left C5-C6 dermatomes. Patient 2 showed weakness in the right thigh and groin after a right L2-L3 herpetic <e>eruption</e>. The electromyograms of all 3 patients showed abnormal spontaneous activity in the affected muscles. Intravenous acyclovir and corticosteroid pulse therapy were added to oral antiviral drugs for patients 1 and 2. All 3 patients recovered favorably. Our review of the literature revealed that antiviral treatment may prevent the occurrence of zoster paresis; however, there is insufficient evidence to show what treatment hastens recovery from zoster paresis. CONCLUSIONS: Segmental zoster paresis is still underrecognized by neurologists. Awareness of this disorder is important because it may eliminate unnecessary invasive investigations and lead to appropriate treatment. Further studies on the treatment are necessary.",M1

17614800,"Cutaneous manifestations of dengue viral infection in Punjab (north India).BACKGROUND: Dengue infection is emerging as a public health problem in India. Despite numerous studies, there is a paucity of literature regarding the cutaneous manifestations of dengue. This study was performed to investigate the prevalence and type of cutaneous manifestations in dengue viral infection. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-six patients with febrile illness, admitted to the Christian Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, India, were studied. On the basis of the clinical criteria and laboratory tests, 124 patients were diagnosed with dengue viral infection, and these patients were investigated in detail. Serologic tests were attempted in only 84 patients, and all of these samples tested positive for anti-dengue immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. RESULTS: Of the 124 patients with dengue infection, 41 (23.1%) were classified with dengue fever (DF) and 83 (66.9%) with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), four (3.2%) of whom had dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Cutaneous involvement was seen in 46.8% of patients, the most common symptom being maculopapular/morbilliform <e>eruption</e> (48.3%), followed by ecchymotic (27.6%), petechial (13.8%), and macular/scarlatiniform (10.3%) eruption. Maculopapular eruption was observed more in DF, whereas petechiae, ecchymosis, and mucosal involvement were seen more in DHF; 72.4% of patients with cutaneous manifestations were asymptomatic, and 27.6% had pruritus. Involvement was generalized in 48.3% of patients, with the limbs and trunk involved in 32.8% and 18.9% of patients, respectively. Mucosal involvement was seen in 29.8% of patients, with conjunctival involvement being the most common (20.9%), followed by the lips (4.8%), palate (2.4%), and tongue (1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the variety of cutaneous features associated with dengue viral infection which may evolve during the course of the disease. As a significant proportion of patients showed cutaneous features, these manifestations, together with simple laboratory tests, will be helpful in the early diagnosis of dengue viral infection.",M1

These conditions may show considerable clinical overlap. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative proportion of pruritic papular cutaneous eruptions in South Africans with HIV-associated dermatoses, and to correlate the clinical and histologic features of these lesions. METHODS: The clinical and histologic features of papular follicular eruptions were correlated in 40 consecutive black HIV-positive patients who underwent skin biopsy. RESULTS: The clinical features were similar in all patients and consisted of widespread papules and pustules involving the face, limbs, and trunk. The most common histologic finding was acute suppurative folliculitis, seen in 27 patients (67.5%). In most cases, no cause was found for the suppuration. Papulopruritic eruption of HIV was diagnosed in six patients (15%), HIV-associated eosinophilic folliculitis in four (10%), Pityrosporum folliculitis in two (5%), and acne in one (2.5%). Concordance between the initial clinical diagnosis and the final histopathologic diagnosis was achieved in only 27.5% of cases.

17367263,"Incidence and management of cutaneous toxicities associated with cetuximab.Cetuximab is a human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to the EGF receptor, competitively inhibiting ligand binding, and inducing receptor dimerization and downregulation. Cetuximab has been active in multiple tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC), head and neck, pancreatic and lung cancers. Cetuximab has been approved by the FDA, in combination with irinotecan, for the treatment of metastatic CRC in patients refractory to irinotecan, and for use as a single agent in the treatment of recurrent metastatic CRC in patients intolerant of irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Most common toxicities are rash, diarrhea, fever, headache, nausea, hypomagnesemia and hypersensitivity reactions. Data from several clinical trials with cetuximab show a positive correlation between rash and response and/or survival. Rash occurred on 90% of patients treated with cetuximab monotherapy and grade 3 or 4 skin reactions occurred on as many as 16% of patients in the trials using cetuximab. A rash usually presents as pustular or maculopapular follicular <e>eruption</e>, often referred to as acneiform. Cetuximab will engage in productive dimerization complexes in human skin causing significant disruption of the normal development and maintenance of the hair follicle, which leads to follicular response and inflammatory response. At this time there are no standard or evidence-based treatment plans for the rash. Most of the evidence is based on institutional or personal experiences. The most commonly used agents are topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, topical steroids, systemic immunomodulatory agents, topical immunomodulatory agents and anti-inflammatory preparations. As cetuximab is becoming widely used in general oncology practice, it is important to understand the toxicity of rash to develop practice guidelines for their management. This review addresses recommendations for toxicity management of rash caused by cetuximab in treatment of metatstatic CRC.",M1
17357592,"Drug-related hospital admissions--an overview of frequency and clinical presentation.Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are the cause of hospital admissions for millions of patients every year and are believed to be a major problem in terms of morbidity and hospital expenses. ADR are characterized by exceptional variety, both considering pathomechanism and clinical symptoms. During the time period between 2000-2004 at the Department of Dermatology a project was undertaken to monitor patients who were hospitalized as a result of ADR. Within five years 57 patients, including 30 men and 27 women were observed. The majority of the patients developed maculaopapular rash (16), urticaria medicamentosa and Quincke's edema (16) and erythema multiforme (15). The other cases included erythroderma (5), anaphylactic shock (2), lichenoid exanthem (1), bullous <e>eruption</e> (1) and Hoigne's syndrome (1). The most probable factors producing these changes were concluded to be non-steroid antiinflammation drugs (33%), antibiotics (7%) and other drugs from different pharmacological and chemical groups (carbamazepine, diltiazem, hydrocortisone, methotrexate and herbs). The frequency of occurrence of skin changes of particular type in age groups were also analyzed. The greatest number of skin changes in response to drug therapy was in the age group 41 - 60, while for the age group &gt; 60 ADR revealed the greatest diversity in the clinical picture. The most probable explanation of these findings are the polypragmasy applied in the elderly patients and interdrug interaction as well as decreased efficiency of the organic clearances.",M1
17313465,"Reduced dose of foscarnet as preemptive therapy for cytomegalovirus infection following reduced-intensity cord blood transplantation.Although foscarnet is a promising alternative for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, its toxicity can be significant in patients with advanced age. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 123 patients (median age of 55; range, 17-79) who received reduced-intensity cord blood transplantation (RI-CBT). Patients preemptively received reduced-dose foscarnet 30 mg/kg twice daily when CMV antigenemia exceeded 10/50,000. Sixty-three patients developed CMV antigenemia on a median of day 34, and 29 received foscarnet preemptively. The median level of CMV antigenemia at the initiation of foscarnet was 30. Median duration of foscarnet administration was 24 days. Adverse effects included electrolyte abnormalities (n=19), renal impairment (n=13), and skin <e>eruption</e> requiring discontinuation of foscarnet (n=1). Preemptive therapy of foscarnet was completed in 18 patients. Seven patients died during foscarnet use without developing CMV disease.

Reduced dose of foscarnet is beneficial to control CMV reactivation following RI-CBT; however, it has considerable toxicities in RI-CBT recipients with advanced age. Further studies are warranted to minimize toxicities and identify optimal dosages.",M1
17239150,"Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis associated with a human parvovirus B19 infection.Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a reaction pattern with characteristic clinical features. AGEP typically presents with at least dozens of non-follicular sterile pustules in addition to fever and elevated blood neutrophils. The onset is acute and pustules tend to resolve spontaneously. We herein report the findings of a 33-year-old female who presented with erythema on her elbows and dorsal thighs. Before onset, she did not receive any medications. She had no history of psoriasis, had not touched mercury, did not use tampons and was not pregnant. On the third eruptive day, she developed more than 100 non-follicular pustules in diffuse edematous erythema on her trunk and extremities, predominantly involving the intertriginous areas and she also demonstrated high fever. Her temperature returned to within the normal limits on the fourth eruptive day and the pustules thereafter dramatically vanished until the fifth <e>eruption</e> day. Enzyme immunoassays (EI) were performed for anti-virus antibodies and revealed a seroconversion of antihuman parvovirus B19-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies, thus indicating a primary human parvovirus B19 infection.

We speculated that human parvovirus B19 may therefore be one of the causative agents of AGEP.",M1
17190842,"Livedoid skin reaction probably due to imatinib therapy.OBJECTIVE: To report 3 cases of skin rash with a peculiar livedoid pattern that were probably associated with imatinib therapy. CASE SUMMARY: In the first case, a 74-year-old male diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), treated with imatinib 400 mg/day, developed a skin <e>eruption</e> with a livedoid pattern. Systemic corticosteroids were started, and skin lesions improved. The second case involved a 66-year-old male with Ph+ CML who was treated with imatinib 600 mg/day. After initiation of this treatment, he developed a skin rash with a livedoid pattern. The drug treatment was discontinued and then reintroduced. Topical corticosteroid treatment was started, resulting in total remission of the skin lesions. When the imatinib dose was progressively reintroduced, the skin lesions recurred. The patient died as a result of the progression of his disease. In the third case, a 43-year-old male with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia was treated with imatinib 600 mg/day. After a few days of treatment, the patient developed a skin rash with a livedoid pattern. He died as a result of probable septic shock. DISCUSSION: Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor that inhibits BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase. There have been several published articles on cutaneous adverse reactions related to imatinib therapy. The most common cutaneous adverse event of imatinib is a rash with variable clinical presentation. The Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between imatinib and the rash in all 3 cases reported here. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse reactions to imatinib that affect the skin occur frequently. They are strongly dose dependent, self-limiting, or easily managed by lowering the dose of imatinib and, if necessary, prescribing short-term therapy with a systemic corticosteroid. Clinicians should monitor patients taking imatinib and institute treatment quickly if a rash develops.",M1

We describe a case of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) after institution of treatment with imatinib. PATIENT AND METHODS: A 78-year-old woman was treated with low-dose imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia since November 2003. A macular and pruritic <e>eruption</e> appeared on the patient's trunk after 7 weeks of treatment and gradually worsened.

DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case of DRESS following treatment with imatinib. Cutaneous reactions to imatinib are frequent and are usually mild, comprising maculopapular eruption, pruritus and facial edema. Few cases of serious skin reactions have been reported until now. Several authors suggest that the prevalence and severity of cutaneous manifestations are related to a pharmacologic effect of imatinib.

We describe 5 patients who developed neosensitization to different drugs taken during a previous episode of anticonvulsant-related DRESS, in whom skin prick, intradermal and/or patch tests were performed to confirm the diagnosis of drug hypersensitivity. In 1 patient, transient hypogammaglobulinemia was observed during the AHS. Four of the 5 patients developed a delayed skin <e>eruption</e> or a delayed systemic hypersensitivity reaction after intake of a drug that they had also taken during a previous anticonvulsant DRESS which had occurred months or years earlier; in the fifth, a possible reaction was prevented thanks to the allergy workup.

The skin changes were accompanied by fever (100.4 degrees F [38 degrees C]) and malaise. The patient was convinced that the dermatitis was induced by the consumption of  spoilt  pork sausage (bad smell, changed taste) approximately 24 hours earlier. Clinical examination revealed a woman with phototype III skin, black eyes, and black hair, in good general health. Widespread, symmetrical, moderately intense erythema and isolated or coalescing targetoid lesions studded with discrete, pinhead-sized, nonfollicular pustules in the center or at the periphery were distributed over her face, trunk, groins, and upper and lower extremities (Figures 1). On the neck and abdomen, lamellar desquamation was observed (Figure 2). Palms, soles, scalp, mucous membranes, hair, and nails were not affected. Nikolsky's sign was negative. The patient complained of very slight skin burning and itching. The pregnancy was proceeding without any complications and her obstetric status was normal. The woman had neither any accompanying diseases, nor previous personal or family history of psoriasis, nor any known allergies. She had taken no systemic medication (not even vitamins). She had three pregnancies; two ended with the delivery of healthy babies and one of them was aborted at her will. Laboratory studies revealed leukocytosis (13.2 x 109/L), neutrophilia (8 x 109/L), anemia (hemoglobin, 108 g/L), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (68-110 mm/h). The results from the following investigations were normal: urinalysis, renal and hepatic function, serum albumin, Ca, Na, K, aspartate aminotransferase titer, cryoprotein, hepatitis B surface antigen, and serum markers for syphilis. Bacterial and fungal cultures of pustular content were sterile. A skin biopsy specimen of lesional skin revealed subcorneal pustules containing leukocytes and necrotic keratinocytes and a mixed perivascular inflammatory infiltrate with isolated eosinophils in the dermis (Figure 3). The patient was treated with systemic methylprednisolone in gradually reduced doses, fluocinonide cream 0.05%, and emollients. As a result, her fever disappeared and her erythema faded. Frequent obstetric examination and cardiotocography were normal and showed no evidence of placental insufficiency.

It is favored in the palliative setting over doxorubicin because of its generally favorable side effect profile. Adverse reactions are predominantly skin eruptions. We report 3 cases of women with breast cancer undergoing treatment with liposomal doxorubicin who developed palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and diffuse morbilliform eruptions. Biopsies in the 2 cases demonstrated vacuolar interface dermatitis with epidermal dysmaturation and the third case suggested a drug eruption. Additionally, we report a woman with metastatic breast cancer who developed a similar morbilliform eruption soon after completing a regimen of liposomal doxorubicin. The biopsy revealed an atypical squamous proliferation showing epidermal dysmaturation with focal evidence of interface damage. Both clinician and pathologist alike should be cognizant of this cutaneous eruption, as well as the histologic patterns.",M1
16549916,"Does erysipelas-like rash after hip replacement exist?BACKGROUND: Orthopaedic implants are known to rarely induce or exacerbate dermatitis in metal-allergic patients.

Patients presented with recurrent <e>eruption</e> of the skin overlying the implant, associated with fever. An aseptic origin of this new syndrome was hypothesized as no evidence of microbial involvement could be found and because antibiotic treatment was apparently inefficient. OBSERVATIONS: We observed 4 similar cases. All patients recovered after suppression of factors predisposing to erysipelas (gluteal portal of entry, anti-inflammatory drugs) and appropriate antibiotic therapy. DISCUSSION: Our conviction is that these manifestations are authentic infectious cellulitis. Delayed thigh erysipelas after hip surgery is a distinctive form of cellulitis, characterized by its unusual topography, its rapid outcome and the possibility to be recurrent.",M1
16538176,"Genetic susceptibility to carbamazepine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions.The anticonvulsant carbamazepine (CBZ) frequently causes cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs), including maculopapular <e>eruption</e> (MPE), hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). We reported that SJS/TEN caused by CBZ is strongly associated with the HLA-B*1502 gene in Han Chinese. Here, we extended our genetic study to different types of CBZ-cADRs (91 patients, including 60 patients with SJS/TEN, 13 patients with hypersensitivity syndrome and 18 with maculopapular exanthema versus 144 tolerant controls). We used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to screen the genetic association of 278 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which cover the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, heat shock protein and CBZ-metabolic enzymes, including CYP3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 1A2 and epoxide hydrolase 1. In addition, we genotyped 20 microsatellites in the MHC region and performed HLA-typing to construct the recombinant map. We narrowed the susceptibility locus for CBZ-SJS/TEN to within 86 kb flanking the HLA-B gene on the extended B*1502 haplotype, and confirmed the association of B*1502 with SJS/TEN [Pc=1.6x10, odds ratio (OR)=1357; 95% confidence interval (CI)=193.4-8838.3]. By contrast to CBZ-SJS/TEN, HLA-B*1502 association was not observed in the MPE or HSS groups: MPE was associated with SNPs in the HLA-E region and a nearby allele, HLA-A*3101 (Pc=2.2x10, OR=17.5; 95% CI=4.6-66.5), and HSS with SNPs in the motilin gene (Pc=0.0064, OR=7.11; 95% CI=3.1-16.5) located terminal to the MHC class II genes. No SNPs in genes involved in CBZ metabolism were associated with CBZ-induced cADRs. Our data suggest that HLA-B*1502 could contribute to the pathogenesis of CBZ-SJS/TEN, and that genetic susceptibility to CBZ-induced cADRs is phenotype-specific.",M1

Atypical or modified types of already known conditions can easily be mistaken for new entities. OBJECTIVES: To report 29 cases of an acute, self-limiting exanthem never described before. METHODS: Clinical description, serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other laboratory investigations. RESULTS: The <e>eruption</e> starts with bright pink-red slightly oedematous macules symmetrically arranged on the trunk. The lesions tend to coalesce, and spread to the limbs on which they may acquire a marginated annular appearance. The lesions invariably spare the face (including oral mucous membranes), palms and soles. The eruption is pruritic and lasts 20-30 days, clearing spontaneously. The disease has a predilection for men aged 17-56 years and occurs mostly between spring and summer.

Several clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia. Adverse cutaneous reactions induced by imatinib are frequent and may be dose related. We report a case of an unusual pustular eruption in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia, who received high doses imatinib for blast crisis and later voriconazole for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. At the time of his skin eruption, elevated plasma levels of imatinib were recorded. Imatinib is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome CYP3A4. Voriconazole is a cytochrome CYP3A4 inhibitor and can lead to high plasma levels of imatinib. This case suggests that severe drug reactions to imatinib may be related not only to imatinib doses, but also to elevated plasma drug levels resulting from pharmacokinetic interactions.

16045866,"Cutaneous reactions due to diltiazem and cross reactivity with other calcium channel blockers.BACKGROUND: The spectrum of cutaneous <e>eruptions</e> in association with calcium channel blockers is extensive, varying from exanthemas to severe adverse events. Reactions due to diltiazem occur more frequently than with other calcium channel blockers. Patch testing has been used as confirmatory testing in patients with extensive cutaneous reactions. Cross-reactivity among these drugs have not been established. MATERIAL: We present 3 patients: 1) A 54-year-old man developed a generalized erythema-multiforme-like reaction followed by erythrodermia and exfoliative dermatitis 6-7 days after starting on diltiazem. The drug was stopped and remission was obtained with emollients and systemic corticosteroids and antihistamines within 12 days. 2) A 80-year-old woman experienced a pruritic exanthematous eruption on her trunk which evolved to generalized erythrodermia and superficial desquamation. This reaction appeared 10 days after taking diltiazem, and gradually improved in 10-12 days after discontinuation of this drug. 3) A 79-year-old man presented with erythema and pruritus initially on the back, and then affecting thorax, extremities and face. He had started treatment with diltiazem three days before. Diltiazem was stopped and steroid and antihistamine therapy was given. His skin condition improved, but 3 days later the patient received verapamil with worsening of previous situation. He recovered within 7 days. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two to six months after the reaction, we carried out epicutaneous tests with calcium channel blockers from different groups. Diltiazem proved positive (at 48 and 96 hours) in the three patients; nifedipine was also positive in patient 2, and verapamil in patient 3. Controlled administration of verapamil was well tolerated in patient 2 after the reaction, and the patient 1 has taken nifedipine without problems. CONCLUSIONS: 1) We report 3 cases of cutaneous reactions due to diltiazem. 2) Epicutaneous tests have been useful for diagnosis. 3) As one of patients had positive patch tests to diltiazem and nifedipine, and other one with diltiazem and verapamil, more studies are needed to demonstrate cross reactions among calcium channel blockers.",M1

15985813,"Histopathology of drug-induced exanthems: is there a role in diagnosis of drug allergy?PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cutaneous <e>eruptions</e> are among the most common adverse drug reactions and may often represent a challenging diagnostic problem. This review focuses on histopathological and immunohistochemical findings of drug-induced maculo-papular exanthems and discusses the value of skin biopsies and consequent histopathological examination in the diagnosis of these reactions. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from immunohistological studies indicate that CD4+ T cells expressing cytotoxic granule proteins such as perforin and granzyme B are critically involved in the pathogenesis and contribute to the generation of typical histopathological features of drug-induced maculo-papular exanthems, i.e. an interface dermatitis with vacuolar alteration and some apoptotic basal keratinocytes. In addition, an upregulation of both type 1 (i.e. IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) and type 2 (i.e. IL-5) cytokines has been reported. IL-5 together with other chemokines (i.e. eotaxin/CCL-11) provides an explanation for tissue eosinophilia, which may be suggestive of a drug eruption if present. SUMMARY: There are no absolute histological or immunohistological criteria for the diagnosis of drug-induced maculo-papular exanthems and even if the observed histological changes are compatible with a drug-induced eruption, biopsy may not definitely exclude alternative causes since there is considerable overlap with features seen in other entities. In mild cases with no severe signs or symptoms and a clear temporal relationship, clinical information and the morphologic pattern of skin lesions are often sufficient for diagnosis. However, in complex and severe cases or when the precise morphology is unclear, histopathological findings may provide some clues and assist in reaching a correct diagnosis.",M1

He presented with measles-like exanthems on his face, trunk, and extremities. Deep red enanthems were seen on his left buccal mucosa opposite the premolar teeth, and whitish enanthems were seen on the buccal and gingival mucosa. HIV RNA was detected at the high concentration of 5.8 x 10(6) copies /ml in his serum. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed aseptic meningitis with 5,488 copies /ml of HIV RNA. Anti-HIV 1 antibodies against Gp160 and p24 tested by Western blot assay showed seroconversion on day 5 of his admission, seven days after he developed the skin eruptions. The fever lasted for three weeks from the initial onset, and the skin eruptions lasted for twelve days. Histopathologically, a mononuclear cell infiltration was seen mainly in the upper dermis surrounding small vessels and sweat ducts, with CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes predominant. Additionally, CD1a+ putative interdigitating dendritic cells had also infiltrated perivascularly, and were surrounded by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. In situ hybridization study failed to detect HIV products in skin biopsy specimens. Our findings suggested that CD8+ T cells and their interaction with CD1a+ dendritic cells in the skin may be important in inducing skin manifestations in acute HIV infections.",M1
15888154,"The usefulness of skin tests to prove drug hypersensitivity.BACKGROUND: Suspected drug hypersensitivity is common. Only a minority of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) are allergic in origin and will reappear after the next exposure. Methods to confirm suspected CADRs are needed and skin testing could serve as one possibility. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the usefulness of skin tests in revealing drug allergy. The relevance of skin test results was evaluated with drug provocation studies. METHODS: During 1989-2001, 947 patients with a history of suspected CADR were examined with skin tests including patch tests (PTs) (826 patients), skin prick tests (SPTs) (935 patients) and photopatch tests (12 patients). The occurrence of positive and negative test reactions to different drugs was correlated with clinical history. Drug provocation was carried out in 246 patients. RESULTS: Antimicrobial drugs were suspected and tested most often. A positive PT reaction to one or more drug was seen in 89 of 826 (10.8%), most often to beta-lactams, clindamycin and trimethoprim. A positive SPT reaction was seen in 10 of 935 (1.1%) patients. Challenge was carried out in 17 patients with positive skin test results. Thirteen of 16 (81.2%) PT positives developed exanthema, three remained negative and one SPT-positive patient developed urticaria. Among skin test negatives, 207 of 229 (90.4%) challenges were negative and 22 of 229 (9.6%) were positive, 12 with exanthema, three with fixed drug <e>eruptions</e> and seven with urticaria. CONCLUSIONS: Skin testing, especially the PT, was a useful screening method to find a cause of CADR if the reaction was exanthema and if antimicrobial, cardiovascular or antiepileptic drugs were suspected. The SPT detected occasional positives with antimicrobials. In cases of fixed drug eruption, PTs performed at the earlier reaction site were useful. When skin tests are negative or dubious, oral challenge should be carried out to confirm the association.",M1

15767025,"Drug-induced exanthems.Cutaneous adverse reactions to drugs can comprise a broad spectrum of clinical and histopathological features. Recent evidence from immunohistological and functional studies of drug-reactive T cells suggest that distinct T-cell functions may be responsible for this broad spectrum of different clinical reactions. Maculopapular exanthems represent the most commonly encountered cutaneous drug <e>eruption</e>. Previous studies on maculopapular exanthems indicate that drug-specific CD4+ T cells expressing cytotoxic granule proteins such as perforin and granzyme B are critically involved in killing activated keratinocytes. These cells are particularly found at the dermo-epidermal junction and may contribute to the generation of vacuolar alteration and destruction of basal keratinocytes, which are typical found in drug-induced maculopapular exanthems. In contrast to maculopapular exanthems, the preferential activation of drug-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells may lead to more severe reactions like bullous drug eruptions. Furthermore, activation of drug-specific T with distinct cytokine and chemokines profiles may also explain the different clinical features of drug-induced exanthems. IL-5 and eotaxin are upregulated in maculopapular exanthems and explain the eosinophilia often found in these reactions.",M1

Commonly, they appear 5-14 days after onset of drug treatment. Therapy of choice is to avoid the culprit drug and systemic administration of glucocorticoids. A key element in the immune pathogenesis of bullous drug exanthems is presumably the activation of cytotoxic CD8(+) T lymphocytes which recognize drug metabolites as nominal antigens. These compounds form spontaneously (e.g. penicillins) or are metabolized by cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes (sulfonamides).

15572719,"Etiology of pruritic papular <e>eruption</e> with HIV infection in Uganda.CONTEXT: A frequent cause of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa is a commonly occurring, intensely pruritic skin rash. The resulting scars are disfiguring and stigmatizing. Despite the substantial prevalence of pruritic papular eruption (PPE) among HIV-infected Africans, the cause has been elusive. OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiology of PPE occurring in HIV-infected individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study of HIV-infected patients with active PPE from clinics in Uganda conducted from May 19 through June 6, 2003. Enrollment occurred in the month preceding May 19. Each participant was clinically examined by 2 dermatologists, had laboratory studies performed, was administered an epidemiologic questionnaire, and had a skin biopsy of a new lesion evaluated by a dermatopathologist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histological characteristics of new pruritic lesions. Other assessments included CD4 cell count, eosinophil count, and physician-assessed rash severity. RESULTS: Of 109 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 102 (93.6%) completed the study. The CD4 cell counts in this study population were generally low (median, 46/microL) and inversely related to increasing rash severity (median CD4 cell counts: 122 for mild, 41 for moderate, and 9 for severe; P&lt;.001 for trend). Eighty-six patients (84%; 95% confidence interval, 77%-91%) had biopsy findings characteristic of arthropod bites. Patients with arthropod bites on biopsy had significantly higher peripheral eosinophil counts (median, 330 vs 180/microL; P = .02) and had a trend toward lower CD4 cell counts (median, 40 vs 99/microL; P = .07) than those without histological evidence of arthropod bites. CONCLUSIONS: Pruritic papular eruption occurring in HIV-infected individuals may be a reaction to arthropod bites. We hypothesize that this condition reflects an altered and exaggerated immune response to arthropod antigens in a subset of susceptible HIV-infected patients.",M1

BASIC RESEARCH DESIGN: The dental and medical records of healthy infants were reviewed to gather data on birth weight (BW), gestational age (GA), prenatal history, and the time of the eruption of the FPT. Additionally, the mothers of these infants were asked to identify their smoking habits and/or caffeine consumption during pregnancy through face-to-face interviews. The resulting data were statistically analysed with the Student's t, Tukey, and Pearson correlation tests. RESULTS: The mean eruption times (MET) for girls and boys were 7.25 +/- 2.47 and 7.07 +/- 1.66 months respectively (p &gt; 0.05). The MET of the FPT in infants with a GA of less than 34 weeks, 34 to 37 weeks, or over 37 weeks were 8.0 +/- 2.0, 8.29 +/- 2.97, 6.93 +/- 1.87 months, respectively. The MET in infants with a BW of 1500 to 2500g was 8.28 +/- 2.28 months, while the MET for the infants with a BW of over 2500g was 6.99 +/- 1.94 (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: A significant difference was found in the METs of infants with low and normal BWs. No significant differences were observed in the MET as related to other neonatal factors.",M2
20362910,"Prediction of the mesiodistal width of unerupted permanent canines and premolars: a statistical approach.INTRODUCTION: Prediction of the mesiodistal width of unerupted permanent canines and premolars is of major interest for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. METHODS: To improve the accuracy of the prediction, we looked for the best combination of independent variables with multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The most accurate prediction was obtained for the combination of the mandibular right first molar and lateral incisor, and the maxillary left central incisor. Adding to the regression equation 1 erupted canine or premolar improved the accuracy of the prediction considerably. Because of the variable character of the <e>eruption</e> sequence during the second transitional period, a separate regression model for every canine or premolar was necessary. The precision of our new method and other methods from the literature was tested in a separate study group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that our prediction method of the mesiodistal crown diameters of unerupted canines and premolars during the dental transition is accurate. A computer program was developed for user-friendly clinical application.",M2

The frequent complications associated with this disorder very often constitute an indication for extraction of the third molar. This surgical treatment can damage the lower alveolar nerve and/or trigger distal bone loss of the second molar, thus jeopardizing the future status of the periodontium. The author presents two case studies treated exclusively with miniscrews with no dental anchorage in order to achieve partial <e>eruption</e> of the third molar moving it away from the lower alveolar nerve and to avoid unwanted impact on other teeth. Following this procedure, the third molar was extracted without complications. In conclusion, this approach can offer an alternative to surgical treatment alone in cases where the proximity of tooth and nerve poses a significant risk.",M2
20197171,"Predictive model of third molar <e>eruption</e> after second molar extraction.INTRODUCTION: Extraction of second permanent molars is an option for providing space in orthodontic treatment. Although many articles have described its impact on the outcome, there are few data on the prognosis of the eruption of the adjacent third molars. The aims of this investigation were to provide predictive models of eruption of third molars after second permanent molar extraction and to validate them. METHODS: A total of 48 patients (ages, 11-23 years) who had 128 second permanent molars (54 maxillary, 74 mandibular) extracted during orthodontic treatment were followed until eruption of the third molars was complete. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A lineal regression model predicted the final angle of the third molars with the permanent first molar by using the variables of initial angle, jaw, and the developmental stage of the third molar. A logistic regression model predicted the probability of correct eruption by using the variables of initial angle, jaw, sex, age, and the developmental stage of the third molar.",M2
20195514,"Genome-wide association study reveals multiple loci associated with primary tooth development during infancy.Tooth development is a highly heritable process which relates to other growth and developmental processes, and which interacts with the development of the entire craniofacial complex. Abnormalities of tooth development are common, with tooth agenesis being the most common developmental anomaly in humans. We performed a genome-wide association study of time to first tooth <e>eruption</e> and number of teeth at one year in 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC1966) and 1,518 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We identified 5 loci at P&lt;5x10(-8), and 5 with suggestive association (P&lt;5x10(-6)). The loci included several genes with links to tooth and other organ development (KCNJ2, EDA, HOXB2, RAD51L1, IGF2BP1, HMGA2, MSRB3). Genes at four of the identified loci are implicated in the development of cancer.

20191909,"[Correlation between the lower first permanent molar axis and the premature loss of temporary molars]The aim of our study was to determine the impact of premature loss of temporary molars upon the longitudinal axis of the first permanent molar. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study sample was formed by 94 orthopanthomografies of child patients with premature loss of lower temporary molars (first or second) after clinical <e>eruption</e> of the first permanent molar. All panoramic radiographs have been realized with the same panoramic unit with 1.4% magnification coefficient and were analyzed using a standardized technique of tracing the images of teeth and bone on matte acetate paper. It was evaluated the angle between longitudinal axis of first permanent lower molar and occlusal plane. RESULTS: It was observed that premature loss of lower second deciduous molar modifies greater the vertical axis of first permanent molar (between 61 degrees and 79 degrees) then premature loss of first lower primary molar. This is perhaps because the loss of space in the case of premature exfoliation of first primary molar is due more to distal drift of canine then mesial drift of molars. CONCLUSION: The drift to mesial of first permanent molar is more accentuated proportional with the age at which appeared premature loss and so it is loss of leeway space.",M2
20152661,"Primary failure of <e>eruption</e> and PTH1R: the importance of a genetic diagnosis for orthodontic treatment planning.INTRODUCTION: Primary failure of eruption (PFE) is characterized by nonsyndromic eruption failure of permanent teeth in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Recent studies support that this dental phenotype is inherited and that mutations in PTH1R genes explain several familial cases of PFE. The objective of our study was to investigate how genetic analysis can be used with clinical diagnostic information for improved orthodontic management of PFE. METHODS: We evaluated a family (n = 12) that segregated an autosomal dominant form of PFE with 5 affected and 7 unaffected persons. Nine available family members (5 male, 4 female) were enrolled and subsequently characterized clinically and genetically. RESULTS: In this family, PFE segregated with a novel mutation in the PTH1R gene. A heterozygous c.1353-1 G&gt;A sequence alteration caused a putative splice-site mutation and skipping of exon 15 that segregated with the PFE phenotype in all affected family members. CONCLUSIONS: A PTH1R mutation is strongly associated with failure of orthodontically assisted eruption or tooth movement and should therefore alert clinicians to treat PFE and ankylosed teeth with similar caution-ie, avoid orthodontic treatment with a continuous archwire.",M2
20152659,"Postorthodontic root approximation after opening space for maxillary lateral incisor implants.INTRODUCTION: Orthodontic space opening during adolescence is a common treatment for congenitally missing maxillary lateral incisors. Because of continued facial growth and compensatory tooth <e>eruption</e>, several years can elapse between completion of orthodontic treatment for a teenage patient and implant placement. There are reports that, after successful orthodontic opening of the implant space, the central incisor and canine roots reapproximate during retention and prevent implant placement. METHODS: To study this phenomenon, the records of 94 patients with missing maxillary lateral incisors were collected. Periapical and panoramic radiographs were used to measure intercoronal and interradicular distances between the central incisor and the canine adjacent to the missing lateral incisor before and after orthodontic treatment and at implant placement. RESULTS: Although root approximation between the adjacent central incisor and canine during retention did not occur consistently, 11% of the patients experienced relapse significant enough to prevent implant placement. CONCLUSIONS: To ensure sufficient space for implant placement, we recommend at least 6.3 mm of intercoronal space and 5.7 mm of interradicular space between the adjacent central incisor and canine. A bonded wire or resin-bonded bridge will help to reduce root approximation that might occur during retention.",M2
20135246,"Primary failure of <e>eruption</e> (PFE)--clinical and molecular genetics analysis.BACKGROUND: The term  primary failure of eruption  (PFE) refers to the complete or partial failure of a primary non-ankylosed tooth to erupt due to a disturbance of the eruption mechanism. Up to now, the molecular basis for this failure was unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four families were studied in whom at least two members were affected by non-syndromic PFE as part of a clinical and molecular genetics study. Radiological diagnostics (OPTs) were carried out in all patients and their unaffected relatives (control group). The genetic analysis included a genomewide linkage analysis followed by direct DNA sequencing of positional candidate genes. RESULTS: Starting from the index patients, we were able to reconstruct pedigrees over two and/or three generations in the families that indicated an autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance of non-syndromic PFE. Fifteen patients were diagnosed with PFE. Gender distribution was nearly equal (7 female, 8 male). Molecular genetic analysis of the PTHR1 gene revealed three distinct heterozygous mutations (c.1050-3C&gt;G; c.543+1G&gt;A; c.463G&gt;T). Unaffected persons exhibited no mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the genetic causes of non-syndromic PFE can now be used for the differential diagnosis of eruption failure. It permits affected family members to be identified early and may lead to new treatment possibilities in the long term. The genetically-verified diagnosis of  primary failure of eruption  can protect patients and orthodontists from years of futile treatment, because orthodontic treatment alone does not lead to success. Moreover, it has a negative influence on unaffected teeth and areas of the jaw.",M2
20121924,"A new osteopetrosis mutant mouse strain (ntl) with odontoma-like proliferations and lack of tooth roots.A new spontaneous mouse mutant (ntl) with autosomal-recessive osteopetrosis was characterized. These mice formed tartrate-resistant acid phosphate (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts but their osteoclasts had no ruffled border and did not resorb bone. These mice displayed no tooth <e>eruption</e> or tooth root formation. Adult mutant mice developed odontoma-like proliferations near the proximal ends of the incisors. Intraperitoneal injection of progenitor cells from the liver of 16.5 days postcoitum wild-type embryos into newborn mutants rescued the osteopetrosis phenotype, indicating that the defects were intrinsic to the osteoclasts. Our findings not only provide further support for a critical role of osteoclasts in tooth eruption and tooth root development, but also suggest that the perturbation of the homeostasis of the odontogenic precursors of the incisors is primarily responsible for the development of the odontoma-like proliferations in this osteopetrosis mutant. Genetic mapping has narrowed down the location of the mutant allele to a genetic interval of 3.2 cM on mouse chromosome 17.",M2
19863900,"Case report: Surgical luxation and elevation as treatment approach for secondary <e>eruption</e> failure of permanent molars.BACKGROUND. Secondary eruption failure of permanent molars is a rare disturbance that usually causes serious clinical problems to the patient. Various treatment approaches have been proposed that depend on the age of the patient, the developmental stage of the root, the position of the tooth, the severity of infraocclusion and the presence of one or more affected teeth. Surgical luxation followed by elevation and stabilization of the luxated tooth has been proposed as a first-step treatment in cases of young patients with incomplete root formation and favourable position of the tooth. CASE REPORT. A boy initially aged 7.5 years old presented with localized secondary eruption failure of the mandibular right first permanent molar (46) and infra-occlusion. The medical and dental history of the child was uneventful, while there was no history of eruption failure or ankylosis in any other family member. TREATMENT. This included surgical luxation of the tooth, followed by elevation to the occlusal plane and immobilization to the adjacent primary molar. The splint was removed after 4 weeks. FOLLOW-UP. Three years follow-up revealed a successful result with no clinical or radiological pathology of the area. Root development of the affected tooth was arrested, but there was no sign of pulp necrosis. CONCLUSION. Favourable treatment outcome using surgical luxation and repositioning of the teeth in the present case of permanent molar with secondary eruption failure was observed.",M2
20096085,"Dyskeratosis congenita: clinical report and review of the literature.Dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) is an inherited disorder that usually presents in males, consisting of the triad of leukoplakia of the mucous membranes, nails dystrophy and skin pigmentation. Oral and dental abnormalities may also be present. Most cases are X-linked autosomal dominant, but recessive forms have also been reported. This study describes herein a case in which the classic triad of signs was present, along with the development of leukoplakia in the buccal mucosa. Our patient, a 25-year-old man, presented with several characteristic systemic features of this condition, together with the following oral features: hypodontia, delayed dental <e>eruption</e>, short blunt roots, extensive caries, gingival inflammation and bleeding, loss of alveolar bone and buccal mucosa with leukoplakia and irregular ulcers. The patient was given full preventive care. The primary teeth were extracted under local anaesthesia. After establishing optimal oral health, oral hygiene instructions were given to the patient and he was rehabilitated with fixed and removable partial denture. Prosthetic treatments were carried out after establishing optimal oral health. This treatment option appears beneficial in this patient, resulting in rehabilitation of occlusion and less mechanical irritation to the oral mucosa.",M2
20073546,"Clinical report on plaque formation, distribution and maturation within the primary, mixed and permanent dentitions.AIM: The report described the formation distribution and maturation of dental plaque within the primary, mixed and permanent dentitions. DESIGN: Eight caries-free volunteers who were 4-6 years of age participated in the study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The children received prophylaxis and refrained from toothbrushing for 48 hours. The occurrence and distribution of plaque in the primary dentition were assessed. One child continued the experiment from the age of 6 to 15. RESULTS: The recording of plaque was made and pictures were taken. In the primary dentition, 704 surfaces were assessed. Significant difference between plaque on buccal and other surfaces was recorded (p&lt; 0.001). In the mixed and permanent dentition plaque scores of 128 surfaces were recorded. Plaque scores of partially erupted posterior teeth and posterior teeth in full occlusion differed significantly with limited accumulation of occlusal plaque in the latter. CONCLUSION: The report highlights that the most critical period for plaque accumulation is the time from tooth emergence to full occlusion, when the tooth has a reduced participation in the mechanical oral function. As caries is a plaque induced disease, the potential to caries development in children during tooth <e>eruption</e> is consequently high.",M2
20067418,"TNF-alpha upregulates expression of BMP-2 and BMP-3 genes in the rat dental follicle--implications for tooth <e>eruption</e>.The dental follicle appears to regulate both the alveolar bone resorption and bone formation needed for tooth eruption. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene expression is maximally upregulated at postnatal day 9 in the rat dental follicle of the first mandibular molar, a time that correlates with rapid bone growth at the base of the tooth crypt, as well as a minor burst of osteoclastogenesis. TNF-alpha expression is correlated with the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), a molecule expressed in the dental follicle that can promote bone formation. Because BMP-2 signaling may be augmented by bone morphogenetic protein-3 (BMP-3), our objective in this study was to determine if the dental follicle expresses BMP-3 and if TNF-alpha stimulates the dental follicle cells to express BMP-2 and BMP-3. Dental follicles were collected from different postnatal ages of rat pups. Dental follicle cells were incubated with TNF-alpha to study its dosage and time-course effects on gene expression of BMP-2 and BMP-3, as determined by real-time RT-PCR. Next, immunostaining was conducted to confirm if the protein was synthesized and ELISA of the conditioned medium was conducted to determine if BMP-2 was secreted. We found that BMP-3 expression is correlated with the expression of TNF-alpha in the dental follicle and TNF-alpha significantly increased BMP-2 and BMP-3 expression in vitro. Immunostaining and ELISA showed that BMP-2 and BMP-3 were synthesized and secreted. This study suggests that TNF-alpha can upregulate the expression of bone formation genes that may be needed for tooth eruption.",M2
20050734,"Increased occurrence of dental anomalies associated with infraocclusion of deciduous molars.OBJECTIVE: To test the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between infraocclusion and the occurrence of other dental anomalies in subjects selected for clear-cut infraocclusion of one or more deciduous molars. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experimental sample consisted of 99 orthodontic patients (43 from Boston, Mass, United States; 56 from Jerusalem, Israel) with at least one deciduous molar in infraocclusion greater than 1 mm vertical discrepancy, measured from the mesial marginal ridge of the first permanent molar. Panoramic radiographs and dental casts were used to determine the presence of other dental anomalies, including agenesis of permanent teeth, microdontia of maxillary lateral incisors, palatally displaced canines (PDC), and distal angulation of the mandibular second premolars (MnP2-DA). Comparative prevalence reference values were utilized and statistical testing was performed using the chi-square test (P &lt; .05) and odds ratio. RESULTS: The studied dental anomalies showed two to seven times greater prevalence in the infraocclusion samples, compared with reported prevalence in reference samples. In most cases, the infraoccluded deciduous molar exfoliated eventually and the underlying premolar erupted spontaneously. In some severe phenotypes (10%), the infraoccluded deciduous molar was extracted and space was regained to allow uncomplicated <e>eruption</e> of the associated premolar. CONCLUSION: Statistically significant associations were observed between the presence of infraocclusion and the occurrence of tooth agenesis, microdontia of maxillary lateral incisors, PDC, and MnP2-DA. These associations support a hypothesis favoring shared causal genetic factors. Clinically, infraocclusion may be considered an early marker for the development of later appearing dental anomalies, such as tooth agenesis and PDC.",M2
20042740,"Formation of the tooth-bone interface.Not only are teeth essential for mastication, but also missing teeth are considered a social handicap due to speech and aesthetic problems, with a resulting high impact on emotional well-being. Several treatment procedures are currently available for tooth replacement with mostly inert prosthetic materials and implants. Natural tooth substitution based on copying the developmental process of tooth formation is particularly challenging and creates a rapidly developing area of molecular dentistry. In any approach, functional interactions among the tooth, the surrounding bone, and the periodontium must be established. Therefore, recent research in craniofacial genetics searches for mechanisms responsible for correct cell and tissue interactions, not only within a specific structure, but also in the context of supporting structures. A tooth crown that is not functionally anchored to roots and bone is useless. This review aims to summarize the developmental and tissue homeostatic aspects of the tooth-bone interface, from the initial patterning toward tooth <e>eruption</e> and lifelong interactions between the tooth and its surrounding alveolar bone.",M2
19960292,"The role of periodontal ligament cells in delayed tooth <e>eruption</e> in patients with cleidocranial dysostosis.OBJECTIVE: The clinical appearance of patients with cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), which is caused by mutations in the RUNX2 gene, is characterized by anomalies of the clavicles, thorax, spine, pelvis and extremities and by disturbances of the skull and tooth development. Of orthodontic relevance are multiple supernumerary teeth associated with delayed tooth eruption. The present investigation is based on the hypothesis that an altered phenotypic expression of periodontal ligament (PDL) cells from CCD patients and a reduced ability of those cells to support the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts might contribute to delayed tooth eruption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To test this hypothesis, PDL cells from healthy donors and from two patients with clinically and molecular biologically diagnosed CCD were characterized for the basal and induced mRNA expression of osteoblast marker genes. The physiological relevance of the findings for the differentiation of osteoclasts was examined in an osteoclast assay, as well as in a co-culture model of PDL cells and osteoclast precursors. RESULTS: Both CCD patients displayed missense mutations of the RUNX2 gene. The in vitro experiments revealed an unaltered expression of RUNX2 mRNA, however especially in CCD patient 2 there was a reduced basal expression of mRNA for the key regulatory gene for bone remodeling RANKL. Furthermore, compared to the control cells from healthy donors, these factors were less inducible by stimulation of the cultures with 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). In the osteoclast assays as well as in the co-culture experiments, PDL cells from the CCD patients showed a reduced capacity to induce the differentiation of active osteoclasts. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that PDL cells from CCD patients express a less distinctive osteoblastic phenotype resulting in an impaired ability to support osteoclastogenesis which might, in part, account for the delayed tooth eruption that can be observed clinically.",M2

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 4-year longitudinal study was completed. A total of 110 children from a public elementary school, located in a middle-income area of Mexico City, entered the study; of these, 88 completed the 4-year follow-up period. Dental caries assessments were carried out using the WHO criteria for decayed, missing and filled primary and permanent teeth indices (dmft and DMFT, respectively) and surface indices (dmfs and DMFS, respectively). BMI was used to classify the children's obesity status, according to the Centers for Disease Control 2000 reference charts. RESULTS: At 7 years of age, 29.6% of the children were in the overweight or at risk of being overweight categories and, by 11 years of age, this proportion had risen to 45.5%. The mean dmft for children aged 7 years was 2.70 and, for children aged 11 years, the DMFT was 0.54. Children in the higher BMI categories had more erupted teeth than the other children (p &lt; 0.001). A lower dmfs index was detected in the overweight children, compared with children with a lower BMI (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The overweight children had more erupted teeth and a lower caries index.

19917026,"A retrospective study of intrusive injuries in primary dentition.OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate epidemiological aspects of intrusive injuries in primary teeth, extent and severity of injuries, provided treatment, and complications to the primary and permanent dentition. METHODS: This was a retrospective study based on the clinical and radiographic data of 102 intruded teeth in 70 patients. Follow-up period varied from 6 months to 6 years, with the mean time of 2.7 +/- 1.5 years. Data were collected through dental files and dental trauma forms. The following parameters were analyzed at control examinations: rate of spontaneous re-<e>eruption</e>, presence of complications, time elapsed between the injury and complication, and possible sequels on permanent successors. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 2.5 +/- 1.3 years. Fifty-six children were injured because of the fall while walking or running. Most of children had one intruded tooth. Maxillary central incisors were the most frequently injured teeth. Seventy injured teeth were &lt;2 mm intruded. Mean time elapsed from the injury until the professional help was 45.0 +/- 67.3 h. Within 2 months after trauma, 48 intruded teeth re-erupted spontaneously. Crown discoloration occurred in 10 intruded teeth, pulp necrosis was diagnosed in nine cases and pathologic root resorption was found in five injured teeth. CONCLUSIONS: The most common mechanism of injury was fall. Spontaneous re-eruption occurred in the majority of intruded primary teeth. In comparison with moderate or severe intrusions, mildly intruded teeth took less time to re-erupt. Mildly intruded teeth exhibited less complications in comparison with moderately and severely intruded teeth.",M2
19899120,"Occlusal development and masseter activity in Alpacas (Lama pacos).Tooth <e>eruption</e> and the development of occlusion are significant ontogenetic changes in the masticatory apparatus of mammals. Here, we test the hypothesis that changes in masseter activity are correlated with increased occlusal contacts at major stages of dental development in the alpaca, Lama pacos. We compare electromyographic data from the superficial and deep masseter in infant and juvenile alpacas prior to and following m1 occlusion and from adults with full permanent dentitions. The pre-m1 and post-m1 occlusion groups exhibit similar masseter activity durations, chewing cycle durations, and with the exception of the balancing-side deep masseter, similar timing differences between the jaw muscles. On average, the balancing-side deep masseter fires significantly later in the post-m1 occlusion group. The m2-m3 group exhibits significantly longer chewing cycle length and an even later firing balancing-side deep masseter. Increased occlusion is also associated with an increase in the relative amount of working-side superficial and deep masseter muscle activity when compared with the balancing side muscles. Although the development of occlusal relations in infant and juvenile alpacas are associated with minor changes in masseter activation patterns, additional molar occlusal contacts increase chewing cycle duration resulting in concomitant changes in masseter recruitment patterns. Currently, we cannot rule out that musculoskeletal development influences masseter activity as demonstrated in other mammals. However, the data presented here indicate that alpacas have a relatively delayed onset of the adult motor pattern that may be correlated with changes in occlusal relations due to tooth eruption.",M2

19852607,"Influence of first premolar extraction on mandibular third molar angulation.OBJECTIVE: To compare the angular changes in the developing mandibular third molars in both first premolar extraction and nonextraction cases and to determine whether premolar extraction results in a more mesial movement of the mandibular buccal segment and causes favorable rotational changes in the mandibular third molar tilt, which can enhance later <e>eruption</e> of the third molars. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pretreatment (T1) and posttreatment (T2) panoramic radiographs were taken of 25 subjects who had been treated by the extraction of all the first premolars and 25 subjects who had been treated with nonextraction. The horizontal reference plane was used to measure and compare the changes in the angles of the developing mandibular third molars. RESULTS: The mean uprighting of the mandibular third molars seen in the extraction group was 8.2 +/- 5.4 degrees on the left side and 6.3 +/- 6.5 degrees on the right side following treatment (T2 - T1). For the nonextraction group the mean difference was 1.3 +/- 4.3 degrees on the left side and 1.7 +/- 5.4 degrees on the right side. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups (P = .012 on the right side and P &lt; .001 on the left side). CONCLUSIONS: Premolar extractions had a positive influence on the developing third molar angulations. Nonextraction therapy did not have any adverse effects.",M2
19852606,"Opinions of American and Swedish orthodontists about the role of erupting third molars as a cause of dental crowding.OBJECTIVE: To compare the opinions of Swedish orthodontists and American orthodontists regarding the association between third molar <e>eruption</e> and dental crowding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was distributed to Swedish orthodontists (n = 230) asking their views on the force exerted by erupting third molars, its relationship to crowding, and their recommendations for prophylactic removal. Results were compared with those from a similar study conducted in the United States. Chi square analysis was used to determine differences in responses to questions between Swedish and American orthodontists. P &lt; or = .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Both Swedish and American orthodontists believed that lower third molars were more likely than upper third molars to cause force (65% and 58% for Swedish and American orthodontists, respectively) and crowding (42% and 40%, respectively). No statistically significant differences were seen between the answers of American and Swedish orthodontists regarding the role of upper and lower third molars in causing crowding. Although only 18% of Swedish orthodontists  generally  or  sometimes  recommended prophylactic removal of mandibular third molars, 36% of American orthodontists  generally  or  sometimes  recommended removal (P &lt; .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Most orthodontists in the United States and Sweden do believe that erupting lower third molars exert an anterior force; however, they also believe that these teeth  rarely  or  never  cause crowding of the dentition.

STUDY DESIGN: The records of 786 patients who had their M3Ms extracted from 2002 to 2007 at Samsung Medical Center were reviewed. The distal caries of M2Ms, age, gender, angulations, impaction degree, and distance between M2M and M3M were assessed. RESULTS: Among 883 M2Ms, 152 had distal caries (17.2%, caries group). In the caries group, 79.6% of M3Ms exhibited mesial angulation between 40 degrees and 80 degrees and 82.2% of M3Ms exhibited an impaction level in which the most coronal aspect of the M3M was located superior to the occlusal surface of the M2M. The distance between M2M and M3M (between cemontoenamel junctions) was 7-9 mm for 57.2% of the caries group. CONCLUSIONS: The M3Ms under eruption status as described here could be considered for preventive extraction.",M2

19828983,"Root growth during molar <e>eruption</e> in extant great apes.While there is gradually accumulating knowledge about molar crown formation and the timing of molar eruption in extant great apes, very little is known about root formation during the eruption process. We measured mandibular first and second molar root lengths in extant great ape osteological specimens that died while either the first or second molars were in the process of erupting. For most specimens, teeth were removed so that root lengths could be measured directly. When this was not possible, roots were measured radiographically. We were particularly interested in the variation in the lengths of first molar roots near the point of gingival emergence, so specimens were divided into early, middle and late phases of eruption based on the number of cusps that showed protein staining, with one or two cusps stained equated with immediate post-gingival emergence. For first molars at this stage, Gorilla has the longest roots, followed by Pongo and Pan. Variation in first molar mesial root lengths at this stage in Gorilla and Pan, which comprise the largest samples, is relatively low and represents no more than a few months of growth in both taxa. Knowledge of root length at first molar emergence permits an assessment of the contribution of root growth toward differences between great apes and humans in the age at first molar emergence. Root growth makes up a greater percentage of the time between birth and first molar emergence in humans than it does in any of the great apes.",M2
19828979,"Regulation of enamel and dentin mineralization by vitamin D receptor.BACKGROUND: Vitamin D plays an important role in bone mineralization. Enamel and dentin are two mineralized tissues of different origins that are part of the tooth structure, but the mechanism by which vitamin D regulates the mineralization of these tissues remains unclear. We examined the mineral deposition pattern of enamel and dentin in continuously erupting incisors in a vitamin D receptor (VDR) deficient mouse model to determine the effect of vitamin D receptor pathway on enamel and dentin mineralization. METHODS: VDR wild-type mice (VDR+/+) and VDR-deficient (VDR--/--) littermates were sacrificed at 70.5 days of age, and their mandibles were dissected. Immunostaining of biglycan and decorin was used to evaluate the dentin maturation. Micro-computerized tomography (micro-CT) was used to compare the mineral density (MD) of enamel and dentin of the two groups at different regions along the axis of the mandibular incisors. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was employed to examine the ultrastructure of enamel and dentin at the levels corresponding to those examined in the micro-CT studies. Furthermore, an accelerated <e>eruption</e> procedure was performed to exclude the effect of delayed eruption on enamel and dentin mineralization. RESULTS: Different mineral deposition patterns of enamel and dentin were observed at different levels of the incisors in the VDR+/+ and VDR--/-- groups. Early enamel maturation and mineralization, and dentin hypomineralization were observed in the VDR--/-- group. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D affects enamel and dentin mineralization through different mechanisms. It may affect the mineralization of dentin systemically while enamel mineralization may be regulated locally.",M2
19815142,"Percentiles relative to maxillary permanent canine inclination by age: a radiologic study.INTRODUCTION: Few studies have investigated developmental norms for maxillary permanent canine <e>eruption</e>. In this observational cross-sectional study, we aimed to provide an age-related description of the percentiles relative to canine inclination in a large sample of nonorthodontic patients. Associations between inclination and sector were also analyzed. METHODS: Canine inclination and sector location were measured on 1020 panoramic radiographs obtained from subjects of white ancestry aged between 8 and 11 years not seeking orthodontic treatment. The total sample comprised 2037 canines. RESULTS: Canine inclination increases between 8 and 9 years and decreases between 9 and 11 years. The greatest value for each percentile is at 9 years. A linear model should be hypothesized for differences in canine inclination between 2 successive ages in correspondence to each percentile. The proportion of sector 2 canines decreases and that of sector 1 increases with age. In the same age group, the inclination generally decreases as the sector decreases. CONCLUSIONS: Percentiles by age show the average canine inclination in a certain population. Further studies are required to verify whether percentiles can be a diagnostic aid for determining normal canine inclination at a given age and for quantifying the risk of canine impaction or adjacent root resorption.",M2

19722445,"Alternative treatment modalities for immature intruded permanent incisors: report of 2 cases.Intrusion of permanent teeth is one of the most severe types of traumatic injuries. Different treatment strategies have been proposed, and the best approach for each case depends on the stage of root development, severity of the intrusive luxation, presence of alveolar fracture and number of intruded teeth. The purpose of this paper is to describe the treatment management of 2 cases of severely intruded immature permanent maxillary central incisors in 7 1/2- and 8-year-old children. In case 1, the traumatized tooth was treated by surgical repositioning, while in case 2 watchful waiting for spontaneous re-<e>eruption</e> was the treatment of choice. Treatment strategies were successful in both cases, as demonstrated by the continuation of root development, maintenance of pulp vitality, and absence of signs of periapical pathosis during the follow-up period.

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 342 patients (167 females, 175 males), aged between 20 and 25 years (mean: 22.2, SD: 1.8) participated in the study. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed. <e>Eruption</e> status, mucosal and bony coverage type, presence of pain, pericoronitis, suppuration, ulceration, caries in third molar, distal caries in second molar, bone loss, root resorption, or cyst or tumor formation was investigated in addition to the position and the angulation of each tooth. Patients having at least one completely or partially erupted mandibular third molar were classified as group 1 and patients having bilateral impacted mandibular third molars were classified as group 2. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the symptoms and pathologies related with the mandibular right third molar (RM) and the left third molar (LM) among both groups and genders (P &gt; .05). In the total sample, no significant difference was found between the RM and the LM in terms of mucosal coverage type, bony coverage type, and position both in group 1 and group 2 (P &gt; .05); but gender had an influence on the bony coverage type and ramus distance of the RM and the LM in group 2 (P &lt; .05). In the total the sample, symmetry was present for horizontal or distoangular and vertical or distoangular angulations in group 1 and group 2, respectively.

19702075,"Premature birth--Studies on orthodontic treatment need, craniofacial morphology and function.A series of studies have been initiated implying a unique opportunity to evaluate and compare malocclusion traits, orthodontic treatment need, craniofacial morphology, mandibular function, signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and headache between extremely preterm (EPT; born before the 29th week of gestation) and very preterm (VPT; born between 29 and 32 weeks of gestation) and full-term born children. THIS THESIS WAS BASED ON FOUR STUDIES: Paper I. A systematic literature review was undertaken to answer the following questions: Does prematurity result in alterations of palatal morphology, dental occlusion, tooth-crown dimensions, tooth maturation and <e>eruption</e>? What role does neonatal oral intubation play in the appearance of the alterations? Are the alterations in morphology permanent or transient? The literature search spanned from January 1966 to November 2002 and was later extended to September 2008. Furthermore, a quality analysis of the methodological soundness of the studies in the review was performed. Paper II-IV. The aims were to compare EPT and VPT 8- to 10-year-old children with matched full-term controls considering: Prevalence of malocclusion traits and orthodontic treatment need (Paper II). Craniofacial morphology (Paper III). Mandibular function, signs and symptoms of TMD and headache (Paper IV). KEY FINDINGS IN PAPER I AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY SEARCH: Moderate scientific evidence existed for more malocclusion traits among premature children. Limited evidence was found for no delay in dental eruption, if corrected age was considered for the premature children. Insufficientwas considered for the premature children. Insufficient evidence was found for altered tooth-crown dimensions and permanent alteration of palatal morphology among prematurely children. Thus, further well-designed controlled studies which should also consider orthodontic treatment need, craniofacial morphology, TMD and headache are needed. KEY FINDINGS IN PAPER II-IV: A higher prevalence of malocclusion traits and the assessed need of orthodontic treatment were higher among the preterm children compared with full-term born children (Paper II). Several craniofacial parameters differed significantly between preterm and full-term born children (Paper III). Preterm children did not differ from full-term born children when considering diagnoses according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD), signs and symptoms of TMD or headache (Paper IV). KEY CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The increased survival rate of very preterm and especially the extremely preterm children contribute to a new group of children in society. The dental clinician should, therefore, be aware of the potential for a higher number of malocclusion traits, more malocclusion traits per individual, greater orthodontic treatment need and altered craniofacial morphology in prematurely born children compared with full-term born children. In spite of this, the prematurely born children had not more TMD or headache than full-term born children at the age of 8-10 years.",M2

19619199,"Retrospective analysis of the factors influencing mesiodentes <e>eruption</e>.AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the factors that predict the spontaneous eruption of mesiodens. DESIGN: From the records of 431 patients (346 boys and 85 girls, average age 8.8 years) who visited Samsung Medical Center from January 2002 to December 2006, 471 mesiodentes were reviewed. The eruption rate was investigated according to the width/length ratio, angulation, location, and shape determined from periapical or panoramic radiographs. RESULTS: The regression model showed that the width/length ratio and angulation were important determinants influencing the eruption of mesiodentes (P &lt; 0.001, Pearson's r = 0.619). The location of the mesiodentes also affected their eruption (P &lt; 0.01). However, no significant relationship was detected between the shape and eruption rate of mesiodentes (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A lower probability of spontaneous eruption existed when the tooth had a greater angulation, shorter length, and wider width. Spontaneous eruption occurs more often when the mesiodens is located between the permanent incisors.",M2
19619195,"Comparative study of gene expression during tooth <e>eruption</e> and orthodontic tooth movement in mice.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand tooth eruption by comparing the gene expression during tooth eruption and orthodontic tooth movement (OTM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Orthodontic force was applied on maxillary molars for 2, 4, 7 and 14 days to study tooth movement. Mice at PN 0, 7, 10, 15 and 21 were fixed to observe tooth eruption. Comparative study of two procedures was assessed by haematoxylin and eosin, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and in situ hybridization for matrix metalloproteinase (Mmp)2, 13, bone sialoprotein (Bsp) and osteocalcin (Ocn). RESULTS: Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity and expression of Mmp2, 13 were obviously detectable in the compression region during OTM. They were also identified in the occlusal and apical region of alveolar bone during tooth eruption. Strong expression of Bsp and Ocn was detectable at the tension side during OTM. These genes were also expressed in the inner lateral region of alveolar bone adjacent to the tooth, but absent in the inner surface of the occlusal and root apical regions during tooth eruption. CONCLUSION: The process of alveolar bone metabolism during developmental eruption and OTM shares the same mechanism. Internal force, as the orthodontic force for OTM, may be initiating factor for tooth eruption.",M2

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cross-sectional study consisting of 1,013 mothers of children between the ages four to 36 months who visited the immunization clinics at the Community Health Centres in Ife Central and Ife East Local Government Areas. Data was analyzed using STATA (Intercooled release 9) for Windows. RESULTS: A total of 765 mothers (75.5%) reported systemic signs and symptoms in their children. Fever (51.8%), diarrhea (12.5%), and vomiting (2.9%) were the most prevalent symptoms and signs reported. Teething problems were reported by 60% of mothers from a high socioeconomic class, as well as 76.7% and 77.9% from middle and low socioeconomic classes, respectively. Interestingly, 65.5% of mothers believed teething should be accompanied with systemic signs and symptoms such as fever (42.1%), diarrhea (13.9%), and vomiting (0.6%). No significant difference was noted between breastfeeding status, gender of the child, and reported systemic signs and symptoms noticed by the mothers. CONCLUSION: Most mothers in the study reported signs and symptoms adduced to teething in their children irrespective of their beliefs. Fever ranked highest of the signs and symptoms reported. Mothers of children from the high socioeconomic class reported fewer teething symptoms. Breastfeeding status and gender of the child had no effect on teething problems in the children studied. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Most signs and symptoms adduced to teething by parents may actually be due to underlying infections.

Extraction of primary teeth was carried out and orthodontic treatment was considered due to severe tooth wear of primary teeth, lack of space, and development of a class III malocclusion. Analysis was based on clinical examination, photographs, radiographs, and dental casts. In both patients, early mixed dentition was delayed for more than 5 years. Calcification and root development of posterior permanent teeth corresponded with the chronological age. Root resorption of the severely abraded primary teeth and eruption of their successors were delayed or failed. Eruption of permanent teeth occurred slowly after primary teeth were extracted. Orthodontic treatment succeeded in one patient, achieving a normal overjet in combination with a successful orofacial therapy. The disturbed exfoliation of abraded primary teeth and failure of tooth eruption of the posterior teeth could be linked to the systemic pathology and to bruxism. At age 20, eruption of the canines and premolars remained questionable.",M2

19501361,"Functional cues in the development of osseous tooth support in the pig, Sus scrofa.Alveolar bone supports teeth during chewing through a ligamentous interface with tooth roots. Although tooth loads are presumed to direct the development and adaptation of these tissues, strain distribution in the alveolar bone at different stages of tooth <e>eruption</e> and periodontal development is unknown. This study investigates the biomechanical effects of tooth loading on developing alveolar bone as a tooth erupts into occlusion. Mandibular segments from miniature pigs, Sus scrofa, containing M(1) either erupting or in functional occlusion, were loaded in compression. Simultaneous recordings were made from rosette strain gages affixed to the lingual alveolar bone and the M(2) crypt. Overall, specimens with erupting M(1)s were more deformable than specimens with occluding M(1)s (mean stiffness of 246 vs. 944 MPa, respectively, p=0.004). The major difference in alveolar strain between the two stages was in orientation. The vertically applied compressive loads were more directly reflected in the alveolar bone strains of erupting M(1)s, than those of occluding M(1)s, presumably because of the mediation of a more mature periodontal ligament (PDL) in the latter. The PDL interface between occluding teeth and alveolar bone is likely to stiffen the system, allowing transmission of occlusal loads. Alveolar strains may provide a stimulus for bone growth in the alveolar process and crest.",M2

Panoramic and periapical radiographs were examined for all those patients aged 5 to 19 years. RESULTS: The prevalence of agenesis of the lateral incisors was 7.3% (100 patients), with more girls than boys being affected. The prevalence rates of absent upper and lower lateral incisors were 2.7 and 4.8% (34 and 63 patients), respectively. Nine (0.7%) of the total patients had microdontia. <e>Eruption</e> disturbance was present in five patients (0.4%). Two of five patients presented with a disturbed eruption owing to an odontoma or a supernumerary tooth.

Nevertheless, the early differential diagnosis of an eruption disturbance is important in order to begin appropriate treatment at the optimal time.",M2
19455930,"Decoronation as an approach to treat ankylosis in growing children.There is no greater treatment challenge for the dental practitioner than the scenario resulting when an immature permanent anterior tooth in a young and growing child becomes ankylosed following traumatic injury. In such cases the clinician has few good treatment options because there is no known therapy to reverse ankylosis. At the some time, without treatment the ankylosed tooth poses both developmental and esthetic problems because it will not erupt further nor will it allow the alveolar bone to grow and develop and follow the <e>eruption</e> of adjacent teeth. This review article will present the most commonly recommended treatment options for this clinical challenge. Of the possible options, a decoronation procedure offers one of the best and most predictable clinical outcomes. This procedure involves the removal of the crown of on ankylosed tooth, leaving the root in its alveolar socket in situ. It has been shown that performing this procedure at the appropriate time allows for the facio-palatal width of the alveolus to be maintained for years, while allowing additional vertical growth of the alveolus. The long-term goal of this procedure is allow for the placement of an implant after growth completion in such a manner that the esthetic outcome is maximized, while allowing for an implant placement procedure that is both easier and more predictable.",M2

The eruption duration and conditions of DC-associated premolars were examined to predict such eruption following marsupialization. STUDY DESIGN: The eruption and conditions including depth, root formation, inclination, and eruption space were examined retrospectively in 21 DC-associated mandibular premolars using dental and panoramic radiograms. RESULTS: Fifteen of 21 premolars erupted half within 3 months and all 15 erupted completely within 10 months after marsupialization, without orthodontic traction. The age of the patients, tooth depth, and inclination were significantly different between the erupted and non-erupted groups, whereas there was no significant difference in the root formation or the eruption space between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The successful eruption of a DC-associated premolar can be predicted within 3 months after marsupialization. Furthermore, the eruption may be affected by the patient's age, tooth depth, and tooth inclination.",M2
19432087,"[<e>Eruption</e> times of permanent teeth in children and adolescents in Latakia (Syria)]The eruption times of permanent teeth and the sequence of tooth eruption were investigated in 1000 individuals aged 5 to 13 years (female: 469, male: 531). Wisdom teeth were excluded from the evaluation. All individuals were inhabitants of Latakia (Syria). The results were compared to dentition studies originating from neighbour countries and Germany, published in recent years. The teeth emerged symmetrically in each jaw. However, teeth erupted earlier in the mandible than in the maxilla, excluding the slightly earlier eruption of maxillary premolars and first molars. The sequence of emerging teeth in the maxilla of females is: first molar, central incisor, lateral incisor, first premolar, second premolar, canine, and second molar. The sequence of tooth eruption of the mandible of females differs from the maxillary sequence: first molar, central incisor, lateral incisor, first premolar, canine, second premolar, second molar. The sequence of emerging teeth in the maxilla of males is: first molar, central incisor, lateral incisor, first premolar, second premolar, canine, and second molar. The sequence of tooth eruption of the mandible of males differs from the maxillary sequence: first molar, central incisor, lateral incisor, first premolar, canine, second premolar, second molar. The results of this study show some differences compared to the dentition of children and adolescents of other countries, emphasizing the need for further dentition studies to be performed in defined regions and obtained by the same method. Concerning the demands of forensic odontology the age of Syrian children might be underestimated if German standards for age estimation are used.",M2

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 242 patients ranging in age from 18 to 41 years of age suffering from pericoronitis were examined. Subjective and objective observations were recorded on a checklist that included the name, age, gender, type of pericoronitis and state of eruption, position of the affected tooth for each patient as well as any radiographic changes in the mandibular third molars. RESULTS: The peak age for the occurrence of pericoronitis was in the 21-25 year-old age group. The soft tissues adjacent to vertically inclined, partially erupted mandibular third molars at the level of or above the occlusal plane were the most commonly affected. There was a statistically significant association between radiographic changes and the mesioangular position of the tooth (p&lt;0.002) and the age group of the subject (p=0.004), but the association was not statistically significant between the gender of the subject, type of pericoronitis, state of eruption, and depth of impaction. CONCLUSION: The soft tissues adjacent to vertically inclined, partially erupted mandibular third molars were more frequently affected by pericoronitis than teeth that are soft tissue impacted or erupted. Mesioangular erupted third molars were the teeth most frequently associated with bone loss. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The soft tissues at highest risk of developing pericoronitis are those adjacent to mandibular third molars that are partially erupted, in a vertical position, and erupted to the level of or above the occlusal plane.",M2

CSF-1, RANKL and OPG are regulatory molecules essential for osteoclastogenesis. To verify the effects of impeded <e>eruption</e> on bone remodeling, the tooth eruption was prevented by immobilization of lower rat incisor and CSF-1, RANKL and OPG distribution in the ERP was analyzed after 18 days of immobilization and in normal eruption. The region of the alveolar crest of the rat incisor was used. Immunohistochemistry and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) were performed. The immunostaining of the dental follicle was quantified using Leica QWin software. Positive-TRAP osteoclasts were counted, and both groups were compared. In the normal incisor, the number of osteoclasts was significantly greater than in the immobilized tooth. In the dental follicle, there was no significant difference in the immunostaining intensity for CSF-1 and OPG between the groups (p &gt; 0.05), but for RANKL the immobilized incisor group showed immunostaining intensity smaller than the normal incisor group (p &lt; 0.01). These findings suggest that changes in the ERP, in the immobilized incisor, modify the RANKL/OPG ratio, in the presence of CSF-1, altering the metabolism of cells that participate in the bone remodeling.",M2
19419450,"Genetic analysis of familial non-syndromic primary failure of <e>eruption</e>.OBJECTIVES: While some eruption disorders occur as part of a medical syndrome, primary failure of eruption (PFE) - defined as a localized failure of secondary tooth eruption - exists without systemic involvement. Recent studies support that heredity may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PFE. The objective of our human genetic study is to investigate the genetic contribution to PFE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four candidate genes POSTN, RUNX2, AMELX, and AMBN) were investigated because of their relationship to tooth eruption or putative relationship to each other. Families and individuals were ascertained based on the clinical diagnosis of PFE. Pedigrees were constructed and analyzed by inspection to determine the mode of inheritance in four families. The candidate genes were directly sequenced for both unrelated affected individuals and unaffected individuals. A genome wide scan using 500 microsatellite markers followed by linkage analysis was carried out for one family. RESULTS: Pedigree analysis of families suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with complete penetrance and variable expressivity. Sequence analysis revealed two non-functional polymorphisms in the POSTN gene and no other sequence variations in the remaining candidate genes. Genotyping and linkage analysis of one family yielded a LOD score of 1.51 for markers D13S272; D15S118 and D17S831 on chromosomes 13, 15 and 17 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While LOD scores were not significant evidence of linkage, extension of current pedigrees and novel SNP chip technology holds great promise for identification of a causative locus for PFE.",M2
19419449,"Cellular and molecular basis of tooth <e>eruption</e>.OBJECTIVES: Tooth eruption requires the presence of a dental follicle (DF), alveolar bone resorption for an eruption pathway, and alveolar bone formation at the base of the bony crypt. The objectives of our investigations have been to determine how the DF regulates both the osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis needed for eruption. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multiple experimental methods have been employed. RESULTS: The DF regulates osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis by regulating the expression of critical genes in both a chronological and spatial fashion. In the rat 1st mandibular molar there is a major burst of osteoclastogenesis at day 3 postnatally and a minor burst at day 10. At day 3, the DF maximally expresses colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) to down-regulate the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG) such that osteoclastogenesis can occur. At day 10, the minor burst of osteoclastogenesis is promoted by upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and RANKL in the DF. Spatially, the bone resorption is in the coronal portion of the bony crypt and genes such as RANKL are expressed more in the coronal region of the DF than in its basal one-half. For osteogenesis, bone formation begins at day 3 at the base of the bony crypt and maximal growth is at days 9-14. Osteo-inductive genes such as bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) appear to promote this and are expressed more in the basal half of the DF than in the coronal. Conclusion - The osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis needed for eruption are regulated by differential gene expression in the DF both chronologically and spatially.",M2
19419448,"Mechanism and control of tooth <e>eruption</e>: overview and clinical implications.OBJECTIVES: To review pre- and post-emergent eruption, with particular emphasis on distinguishing isolated molar ankylosis from primary failure of eruption (PFE) and genetic considerations in eruption problems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Radiographic review of eruption failure patients; animal and human experiments; high precision observations of movements of erupting teeth. RESULTS: In pre-emergent tooth eruption, the controlling element is the rate of resorption of overlying structures. A path is cleared, and then the erupting tooth moves along it. This has clinical importance in recognizing the cause of eruption problems, particularly PFE, in which all teeth distal to the most mesial involved tooth do not erupt or respond to orthodontics. In our study of by far the largest sample of PFE cases yet reported, familial cases of PFE accounted for approximately (1/4) of all cases examined. Candidate genes now are being evaluated. In post-emergent eruption, control seems to be light forces of long duration that oppose eruption, rather than heavy forces of short duration such as those during mastication. Studies of human premolars in their passage from gingival emergence to the occlusal plane show that in this phase eruption occurs only during a few hours in the early evening. The critical hours for eruption parallel the time that growth hormone levels are highest in a growing child. In this stage intermittent force does not affect the rate of eruption, but changes in periodontal blood flow do affect it.",M2
19418736,"Chronology and sequence of emergence of permanent premolar teeth in the horse: study of deciduous premolar 'cap' removal in Thoroughbred racehorses.REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: There are few published data to support the ages of emergence of permanent dentition widely reported in horses. OBJECTIVES: To clarify the chronology and sequence of permanent premolar (PM) tooth emergence in Thoroughbred racehorses. METHODS: A prospective study was undertaken in which records were kept of deciduous PM 'cap' extractions performed during routine dental examinations in Thoroughbred racehorses. Mixed effects multiple regression analysis was used to relate the observed ages, measured in days, for PM 'cap' extractions simultaneously with different predictive variables. Care was taken to account for clustering of multiple observed outcomes within individual horses. RESULTS: A total of 508 deciduous premolar 'caps' were removed from 207 horses, mean ages at removal from PM2, PM3 and PM4 were 35.1, 37.7 and 45.1 months, respectively. Age at which deciduous 'cap' removal occurred was associated significantly with tooth row, upper or lower jaw and gender of the horse concerned. There was a significant trend for later 'cap' extraction age with more caudal teeth, teeth in the upper jaw and female gender. CONCLUSIONS: Age at removal of deciduous premolar 'caps' in this population differed considerably from the ages of emergence of permanent dentition reported widely in equine publications. The results provide the first evidence of sexual dimorphism in the <e>eruption</e> of the permanent premolar dentition in horses. These findings strongly support a model of cheek tooth eruption in the horse in which chronology and sequence of emergence are more complex than previously thought, but which is consistent with understanding of tooth eruption in species that have been studied in greater detail. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Abnormalities of cheek tooth eruption are thought to be a factor in the pathogenesis of a variety of dental conditions, and a thorough understanding of the process of eruption is fundamental to the development of rational strategies for prevention and treatment.",M2
19413375,"Early headgear effects on the <e>eruption</e> pattern of the maxillary canines.OBJECTIVE: To test the null hypothesis that early headgear (HG) treatment has no effect on the eruption pattern of the maxillary canines in the early mixed dentition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight children (40 boys and 28 girls) with a Class II tendency in occlusion and moderate crowding of the dental arches were randomized into two groups. HG treatment was initiated immediately in the first group. In the second group only minor interceptive procedures were performed during the first follow-up period of 2 years. Orthopantomograms were taken at the baseline, three times at 1-year intervals, and after growth at the age of 16. Eruption geometry was performed. The space from the maxillary first molar to the lateral incisor was measured on the dental casts. RESULTS: The inclination of the maxillary canine in relation to the midline appeared to be significantly more vertically oriented on the right side in the HG group 1 and 2 years after starting the HG therapy (P = .0098 and P = .0003, respectively). The inclination in relation to the lateral incisors was smaller in the HG group bilaterally after 1 year and 2 years of HG treatment, and on the right side after 3 years of treatment. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis is rejected. Early HG treatment significantly affects the inclination of the maxillary canine during eruption. The strongest influence was seen after 2 years of HG use, more prominently in the right-side canine.",M2
19365120,"National pathfinder survey on children's oral health in Italy: pattern and severity of caries disease in 4-year-olds.This paper describes the dental health status of Italian 4-year-olds in 2004/2005 and analyzes the association between caries in preschool children and some background characteristics in children and parents. Caries was recorded according to WHO criteria. 5,538 subjects were examined. Information on the children's and their parents' social, behavioral, ethnic and demographic status was obtained through a series of closed questions. Bivariate analysis was performed to investigate the association between caries and background characteristics. The probability of being an extra zero for the dmfs index was estimated via the zero-inflated negative binomial regression model (ZINB). 78.4% (95% CI = 77.2-79.6) of the children were caries-free. The national mean dmfs index was 1.36 (95% CI = 1.15-1.57), ranging from 1.22 (95% CI = 1.03-1.42) in the Italian North-East to 1.73 (95% CI = 0.83-2.63) in the South section. Significant bivariate associations between caries experience and risk factors were observed for parents' nationality (not Italian vs. Italian: p &lt; 0.001), parents' educational levels (low vs. high: p &lt; 0.001), preterm birth (yes vs. no: p = 0.011), prolonged breastfeeding (&lt;/=13 months vs. &gt;13 months: p = 0.038) and early tooth <e>eruption</e> (&lt;6 months as reference: p = 0.004). Multivariable analysis (ZINB) showed that children with a low caries risk level had a higher probability of being an extra zero; in particular, children from fathers with a high educational level showed a probability of being an extra zero of 0.22. The results suggest a need to plan preventive programs to reduce oral health disparities among Italian preschool children, based on educational intervention with parents and children concerning oral health and caries prevention.",M2

19329477,"Normal profiles for deciduous dental <e>eruption</e> in domestic piglets: effect of sow, litter, and piglet characteristics.The deciduous dentition of the domestic pig is comprised of 28 teeth (2 x incisors 3/3, canine 1/1, premolars 3/3, molars 0/0). The timing and sequence of deciduous dental eruption were determined from oral exams on 233 Yorkshire piglets from 0 to 5 wk of age. Eruption occurred sooner in gilts for all molariform premolars (p(3), p(4), and p(4), P &lt; 0.01) and first incisor, i(1) (P = 0.004). Birth weight influenced eruption for all teeth except i(1) (i(1), p(3), p(3), p(4), and p(4); P &lt; 0.01), with heavier piglets having earlier eruption. Average daily gain in wk 1 of life was associated with earlier eruption times of p(3) (P = 0.006), p(4) (P = 0.001), and i(1) (P = 0.001), whereas ADG during wk 2 was associated with earlier eruption for p(4) (P = 0.036). The parity (P = 0.025) and age (P = 0.013) of the sow were associated with earlier eruption of i(1). No litter characteristics were found to be significant. Sequence of eruption was determined to be i(1), p(3), p(4), i(1), p(3), p(4), although polymorphisms (reversals) were found to occur in over 40% of individuals of both sexes for mandibular i(1) and p(4) and maxillary p(3) and i(1). Size of the left i(3), which is already erupted at birth as part of the needle teeth dentition, was found to be larger in males (P = 0.026). Body weight gain was not associated with the size of i(3). Eruption times of p(3) and p(4) (the first premolars to erupt) occurred later than previously reported in the literature. Because these teeth are associated with initiation of feeding behavior for miniature breeds, implications of molar eruption on feeding behavior and feed intake should be considered.",M2

The treatment was carried out in three steps. In the first step, we removed teeth 53s and 63s. As the second step, early removal of teeth 53 and 63 and cementation of a space maintenance appliance (Nance's arch) were performed. In the third step, teeth 13s and 23s were removed, and the Nance's arch was maintained until the complete <e>eruption</e> of teeth 13 and 23.

METHODS: Two hundred and two 2- to 36-month-old children were divided into 3 groups: group 1 = 84 predentate children; group 2 = 68 children with 1 to 8 erupted teeth; and group 3 = 50 children with 9 to 20 erupted teeth. Microbiological samples were obtained from children by cotton swab. Samples were diluted and plated on mitis salivarius agar supplemented with Baocitracin (MSB) for selection and enumeration of SM. RESULTS: SM colonization was found in 26% of children, who had a mean age in months of 20.5 +/- 103 (SD). MS colonization was detected in 5% of predentate children and was detected in children as young as 2 months old. The percentage of children who were colonized with SM rose significantly with increasing age and numbers of erupted teeth (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Streptococci mutans colonization in 2- to 36-month-old Thai children was found in predentate children and detected in children as young as 2 months old. The results suggest that prevention of early SM colonization in some populations may need to be initiated prior to tooth <e>eruption</e>.",M2
19304760,"Dentoalveolar development in subjects with normal occlusion. A longitudinal study between the ages of 5 and 31 years.The aim of the present study was to examine dentoalveolar development in subjects with an 'ideal' (normal) occlusion. The material comprised 436 study casts of 189 male and 247 female subjects of Swedish origin between the ages of 5 and 31 years with no history of orthodontic treatment. Tooth width, and arch length, width, and depth, as well as palatal height were measured. The data were analysed with a Student's t-test. The results verified that continuous changes of the dental arches occur from the primary until the adult period, with individual variations. This change could be interpreted as a biological migration of the dentition, resulting in anterior crowding especially in the mandible, even in subjects with congenitally missing third molars. The occlusion should be regarded as a dynamic rather than a stable interrelationship between facial structures. This natural development has to be considered in orthodontic treatment planning as well as in assessment of stability following orthodontic treatment. A continuous increase of palatal height up to adulthood seems to be an effect of a slow continuous <e>eruption</e> of the teeth. This finding is also of significance in explaining the infraposition of implant-supported crowns.",M2

This study was performed based on data from the records of 169 boys and 138 girls who received assistance at the dental clinic of the State University of Rio de Janeiro from March 1996 to December 2004. The sample was collected from 753 traumatized deciduous teeth of children aged 0-10 years. The number of boys and girls with dental trauma corresponded to 55.0% and 45.0%, respectively. The more affected age period was between 1 and 4 years (75.3%). The most common type of traumatic injury was the intrusion (29.3%), followed by avulsion (14.1%). Concerning permanent dentition, the most common developmental disturbances were discoloration of enamel and/or enamel hypoplasia (46.08%) and <e>eruption</e> disturbances (17.97%) due to the traumatic injury in their predecessors. It was not possible to find an association between the type of injury in primary teeth and sequelae in their successors in the studied age groups (P &lt;/= 1.00). The study concluded that discolorations of enamel and/or enamel hypoplasia (46.08%) were the most prevalent sequelae on the permanent dentition and that there was no significant statistical association between the occurrence of sequelae in the permanent teeth and the type of traumatic injury in their predecessors in the studied age groups.",M2

The study sample was composed of 134 specimens of human enamel. One fragment of each tooth was obtained from the flattest central portion of the crown to produce specimens with 3 x 3 mm. The enamel blocks were minimally flattened out and polished in order to obtain a flat surface parallel to the base, which is fundamental for microhardness testing. Microhardness was measured with a microhardness tester and a Knoop diamond indenter, under a static load of 25 g applied for 5 seconds. Comparison between the superficial microhardness obtained for the different groups was performed by analysis of Student's t test. The results demonstrated that superficial microhardness values have a tendency to increase over the years, with statistically significant difference only between unerupted enamel and that with more than 10 years after eruption. According to the present conditions and methodology, it was concluded that there were differences between the superficial micro-hardness of specimens at different eruptive ages, revealing an increasing mineralization.

STUDY DESIGN: This study was carried out on standardized panoramic radiographs of 41 subjects (8 male, 33 female) with a mean age of 16.6 years (range 13 to 20 years). Twenty-one of the subjects were orthodontically treated with extraction of the 4 first permanent molars, and 20 had nonextraction treatment. The angulational changes and eruption spaces of third molars were evaluated on the panoramic radiographs taken before treatment and at the end of the observation period. RESULTS: Analysis of the linear variables demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for all third molar eruption spaces (P &lt; .001). The mean differences in the third molar eruption spaces between the pretreatment and posttreatment values for the first molar extraction group were higher than those of the nonextraction cases.

In addition, it has greater favorable effect on the angulation of the upper third molars than of the lower third molars.",M2
19133947,"The incidence of mandibular third molar impactions in different skeletal face types.BACKGROUND: The cause of mandibular third molar impaction is said to be due to inadequate space between the distal of the second mandibular molar and the anterior border of the ascending ramus of the mandible. The amount of space is determined primarily by facial growth. This study aimed to assess whether different patterns of facial growth lead to a different incidence of mandibular third molar impaction. It was hypothesized that those with predominantly horizontal (brachyfacial) would have lower incidence of mandibular third molar impaction compared with those with a predominantly vertical growth pattern (dolichofacial). METHODS: Ninety-eight dental records were sourced from the records of orthodontic patients in the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne and all lateral cephalometric radiographs and orthopantomograms were assessed. The degree of impaction was determined by the Pell and Gregory system, and the facial type categorized by the facial axis angle. RESULTS: The overall rate of mandibular third molar impaction was 58.76 per cent. Those with a facial axis angle &gt;93 (brachyfacials) demonstrated an almost two times lower incidence of mandibular third molar impaction as compared to subjects with a facial axis angle &lt;87 (dolichofacials). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the study, it was concluded that the greater horizontal facial growth pattern of brachyfacial subjects over dolichofacial subjects provides increased space for full <e>eruption</e> of the mandibular third molars.",M2

19073954,"Orthodontic force decreases the <e>eruption</e> rate of rat incisors.The aim of this study was to determine whether a force applied in an antero-posterior direction would adequately reduce incisor eruption. This is needed to achieve a constant direction of force which is one of the demands for a good model for studying orthodontic tooth movement. Twenty male Wistar rats aged 11-12 weeks were divided into two equal groups: in the appliance group, a superelastic closed coil spring (25 cN) was placed between the upper left first molar and the incisors. The control group consisted of animals without an appliance. In both groups, cuts were created on the labial surfaces of the upper and lower incisors. The distance from the gingival reference point to the midpoint of the cut was measured for 10 days at 2 day intervals. Upper incisor inclination was determined as the distance from the most mesial point of the upper left first molar to the incisal edge of the ipsilateral incisor on days 0 and 10. Statistical analysis was carried out using two-way analysis of variance and a Bonferroni post- test to estimate reliability. The eruption rates of the maxillary incisors in the appliance group were significantly decreased when compared with the control group during the whole experiment. In the appliance group, the eruption rates of the mandibular incisors were decreased more than those of the maxillary incisors (P&lt;0.01). There was no difference in incisor inclination between the appliance and control groups on day 10 (P=0.81). The applied force of 25 cN in an antero-posterior direction diminished incisor eruption to a level which enabled a constant direction of orthodontic force for 10 days.",M2

19061984,"PTHR1 loss-of-function mutations in familial, nonsyndromic primary failure of tooth <e>eruption</e>.Tooth eruption is a complex developmental process requiring coordinated navigation through alveolar bone and oral epithelium. Primary failure of tooth eruption (PFE) is associated with several syndromes primarily affecting skeletal development, but it is also known as a nonsyndromic autosomal-dominant condition. Teeth in the posterior quadrants of the upper and lower jaw are preferentially affected and usually result in an open bite extending from anterior to posterior. In this study, we show that familial, nonsyndromic PFE is caused by heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the G protein-coupled receptor for parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHR1). Three distinct mutations, namely c.1050-3C &gt; G, c.543+1G &gt; A, and c.463G &gt; T, were identified in 15 affected individuals from four multiplex pedigrees. All mutations truncate the mature protein and therefore should lead to a functionless receptor, strongly suggesting that haplo-insufficiency of PTHR1 is the underlying cause of nonsyndromic PFE. Although complete inactivation of PTHR1 is known to underlie the autosomal-recessive Blomstrand osteochondrodysplasia (BOCD), a lethal form of short-limbed dwarfism, our data now imply that dominantly acting PTHR1 mutations that lead to haplo-insufficiency of the receptor result in a nonsyndromic phenotype affecting tooth development with high penetrance and variable expressivity.",M2
19054472,"Clinical studies on molar-incisor-hypomineralisation part 2: development of a severity index.AIM: This was to examine the records of 182 children (aged 6-14 years) with molar-incisor-hypomineralisation (MIH) or molar hypomineralisation (MH) in order to develop and examine a Hypomineralisation Severity Index for first permanent molars (FPMs). STUDY DESIGN: Records of 429 FPMs in these children were examined and scored for <e>eruption</e> status, extent of hypomineralisation, sensitivity, number of restorative treatments; summed scores were converted to an index for each dentition (possible range: 1.25-7.00). Indices were examined regarding medical conditions occurring singly or in combinations in parentally-recalled children's histories to age 3 years; mean indices were compared for dentitions with these conditions/combinations. RESULTS: The proportion of FPMs receiving no/preventive treatment was higher in dentitions with MH than with MIH (56% vs. 41%); restorative treatment for FPMs was more frequent in dentitions with MIH than with MH (45% vs. 29%). Dentitions with MIH had higher severity indices than those with MH (MIH: index range: 3.25-5.25: 43%; MIH: index range: 1.25-2.00: 61%). Mean severity indices clearly had a higher trend in dentitions of children with certain condition combinations than for those without. Ten condition combinations each contained 3 to 5 medical conditions; 11/12 condition combinations included fevers; 9/12 included chicken pox; 9/12 included perinatal conditions, 6/12 included antibiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: A preliminary Hypomineralisation Severity Index developed for dentitions with hypomineralised first permanent molars in children has shown that MIH and MH form part of an MIH spectrum, where MIH is a more severe form of the condition than MH. The index has indicated associations between hypomineralisation of these molars and combinations of medical conditions, particularly implicating fevers, chicken pox, perinatal conditions and antibiotic use. Further clinical studies are indicated to validate the proposed index and confirm its prognostic value in treatment planning.",M2
19044136,"[<e>Eruption</e> times of permanent teeth in children and adolescents in the German state of Saarland]The eruption times of permanent teeth and the sequence of tooth eruption were investigated in 1,856 individuals aged 4 to 24 years (female: 912, male: 944). Wisdom teeth were excluded from the evaluation. All individuals were inhabitants of the German state of Saarland. The results were compared to results of national and international studies on tooth eruption of the 20th century and studies published in recent years. The teeth emerged symmetrically in each jaw. However, teeth erupted earlier in the mandible than in the maxilla, excluding the slightly earlier eruption of maxillary premolars and first molars in males. The sequence of emerging teeth in the maxilla of females is: first molar, central incisor, lateral incisor, first premolar, canine, second premolar, and second molar. The sequence of tooth eruption of the mandible of females differs from the maxillary sequence: first molar, central incisor, lateral incisor, canine, first premolar, second premolar, second molar. The sequence of emerging teeth in the maxilla of males is: first molar, central incisor, lateral incisor, first premolar, second premolar, canine, and second molar. The sequence of tooth eruption of the mandible of males differs from the maxillary sequence: first molar, central incisor, lateral incisor, first premolar, canine, second premolar, second molar. The results of this study are in accordance with those from other current studies of German federal states, obtained by the same method.",M2
19042111,"Effect of different doses of hexavalent chromium on mandibular growth and tooth <e>eruption</e> in juvenile Wistar rats.Not only workers employed at industrial plants are exposed to intoxication with the element they manipulate, the population at large is also at risk of suffering health problems caused by contaminating wastes inadequately treated for their safe disposal. As a result certain toxic substances, such as hexavalent chromium,has reached the general population including children. The present study sought to evaluate the effect of intoxication with hexavalent chromium on body and mandibular growth and tooth eruption in suckling Wistar rats. Potassium dichromate was administered by gavage in a dose of 6.25 or 12.5mg/kg body weight (b.w.) to one of the two groups of 4-day-old Wistar rats during 10 days. Our results showed that the effects of chromium are dose-dependent. Morphometric studies of body growth showed lower body weight in both experimental groups and shorter tail length in animals receiving 12.5mg/kg b.w. dose of chromium, compared with controls. All parameters of mandibular growth were lower in the experimental group receiving 12.5mg/kg b.w. of chromium. Differences in tooth eruption were observed at the level of the first molar in animals receiving 12.5mg/kg and of the second molar in those receiving 6.25mg/kg b.w. of chromium. Chromium was found to affect all the studied parameters.",M2
19021652,"Intrusive luxation of permanent incisors in Norwegians aged 6-17 years: a retrospective study of treatment and outcome.BACKGROUND/AIM: External replacement resorption (ankylosis-related) is a severe complication leading eventually to tooth loss. Little information exists regarding the influence of variables such as degree of intrusion or treatment method on the development of replacement resolution in intruded permanent incisors. The aim of this study was to report the most frequently involved age group, the preferred type of treatment, and the type and frequency of healing complications. Special attention was paid to the effect of treatment on the occurrence of replacement resorption. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-one intruded permanent incisors were studied in 20 boys and 19 girls aged 6 to 17 years. Only three patients were over 12 years of age. Complete intrusion had occurred in 21 teeth, and 31 teeth were classified as immature. Re-<e>eruption</e> was awaited for 37 teeth. The remaining teeth were repositioned orthodontically (7 teeth) or surgically (7 teeth). RESULTS: Re-eruption occurred in 35 out of 37 teeth over a period of 3-12 months. After a mean observation period of 4 years ranging from 1-12 years, retained pulp vitality was recorded in 22 teeth (43%). Pulp necrosis had developed in 57%, inflammatory resorption in 26% and replacement resorption in 12%. Whereas all inflammatory resorptions were arrested after long-term calcium hydroxide treatment, replacement resorption always led to complete root resorption. In the analysis all orthodontic and surgical repositioned teeth were combined into an active treatment group. The non-active treatment group consisted of teeth allowed to re-erupt. The distribution of replacement resorption was significantly lower in teeth allowed to re-erupt than in teeth repositioned actively. CONCLUSIONS: The best treatment of intruded incisors in 6-12 year-old children is to await re-eruption. Should endodontic treatment be required before re-eruption has occurred, a gingivectomy can be performed to gain access to the root canal.",M2
18923227,"Modified Willet's appliance for bilateral loss of multiple deciduous molars: a case report.No other factor plays a more significant role in preventive and interceptive dentistry than the preservation of deciduous dentition till its normal time of exfoliation. Premature loss of a deciduous tooth or a group of teeth might lead to wide range of implications. When the deciduous second molar is lost before the <e>eruption</e> of first permanent molar, intra-alveolar type of space maintainer is indicated. But in cases of bilateral loss of these teeth the conventional design generally poses a variety of problems. Thus, the conventional designs are required to be modified according to the needs of the patient. Therefore, this paper describes an entirely new design of the Willet's appliance in cases of bilateral loss of deciduous molars before the eruption of first permanent molar.",M2
18818464,"Mesiodens: a radiographic study in children.We analyzed the frequency and radiological features of mesiodens in a group of children in Turkey. The study was based on a radiographic review of 23,000 pediatric patients (male: 12,667 female; 10,333) who visited the Department of Oral Diagnosis and Radiology during the period 2003-2005 (3 years). The presence of an unerupted supernumerary tooth, or tooth bud between the 2 central incisors or as unilateral or bilateral teeth in the midline of the maxilla was noted as mesiodens on radiographs. Eighty-five cases of mesiodens in 69 patients were found. Complete documentation, including radiographs, for these 69 patients were studied and analyzed. In addition to gender and age, the following information about the mesiodens was recorded: 1) number; 2) shape; 3) position; 4) complications caused by the mesiodens; 5) treatment. Of the 69 patients, the ratio of boys (47 cases) to girls (22 cases) was 2.1:1. Fifty-three (76.8%) of the children had 1 mesiodens, and 16 (23.1%) had 2 mesiodentes bilaterally to the midline. Of the 85 mesiodentes, 67 (78.8%) were fully impacted, 6 (7%) were partially erupted, and 12 (14.1%) were fully erupted. Most of the mesiodentes (55.2%) were found in the vertical position, followed by inverted position (37.6%), and horizontal position (7%). The main complications were delayed <e>eruption</e> of the permanent incisors (38.8%), maxillary midline diastema (17.6%), axial rotation or inclination of erupted permanent incisors (16.4%), and resorption of the adjacent teeth (4.7%) The prevelance of mesiodens has been estimated to be 0.15% to 2.2% of the population.",M2
18812864,"Early secondary alveoloplasty in cleft lip and palate.The aims of this study were to present a personal surgical technique throughout the review of international literature concerning surgical techniques, objectives, and outcomes in early secondary alveoloplasty and to describe our personal surgical techniques in alveolar bone defect repair in cleft lip and palate.Throughout a literature analysis, it is now settled that early secondary alveoloplasty could reestablish the continuity of alveolar bone and prevent upper dental arch collapse after presurgical orthopedic upper maxilla expansion; it also might give a good bone support for teeth facing the cleft and allow the <e>eruption</e> of permanent elements with the bone graft and rebalance the symmetry of dental arch, improve facial aesthetic, guarantee an adequate amount of bone tissue for a further prosthetic reconstruction with implant, and finally close the eventual oronasal fistula.The surgical technique we are presenting permitted a total number of 35 early secondary alveoloplasty on which a long-term follow-up is still taking place.We can assess that early secondary alveoloplasty must be performed before permanent canine eruption. Iliac crest is the suggested donor site for bone grafting; orthopedic and orthodontic treatments must be performed in association with surgery, and if there is the dental element agenesia, an implantation treatment must be considered.",M2
18811098,"Empirical support for a fissure sealant placement timeframe protocol for black South Africans.OBJECTIVES: It is recommended that fissure sealants should be placed within four years after <e>eruption</e>. Due to considerable variations in the eruption times of molar teeth, this recommendation is of limited value from a public health perspective. This study, therefore, sought to provide empirical support for a public health fissure sealant placement timeframe protocol. METHODS: The first and second molar eruption patterns of black South African children aged five to seven and 11 to 16 years were analysed in relation to caries experience using the 1999/2002 National Children's Oral Health Survey. RESULTS: By seven years of age, 90% of first molars had erupted with a caries experience of 3%. By 14 years of age the erupted first molars caries experience was 20%. The 13- and 14-year-olds presented with 86% and 98% erupted second molars with a caries experience of 11% and 20%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that during school-based fissure sealant programmes involving black South African children, first molars should be targeted at age seven (Grade 1), or as soon as possible thereafter. However, caries protection may still be achieved until thirteen years of age (Grade 7). Furthermore, second molars should be sealed between the age of 11 and 13 years (grades 5-7).",M2
18797104,"Cementum analysis in cleidocranial dysostosis.OBJECTIVE: Cleidocranial dysostosis (CCD) is a skeletal disorder associated with dental anomalies such as failure or delayed <e>eruption</e> of permanent teeth and multiple impacted supernumerary or permanent teeth. Absence of cellular cementum at the root apex is presumed to be one of the factors for failure or delayed eruption. The aim of this study was to analyze the root cementum of supernumerary(S) and permanent teeth (P) of a CCD patient and to compare the findings with those of normal individuals with special emphasis on delayed eruption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ground sections of 12 extracted teeth (9S + 3P) of a CCD patient and 12 teeth of normal individuals (5S + 7P) were taken for the study. The sections were longitudinal and 50 microm thick. Root characteristics were recorded with the aid of a light microscope. RESULTS: The absence of apical cellular cementum, increased root resorption and increased percentage of the gap type of cemento-enamel (C-E) junctions were significant findings noted both in the supernumerary and permanent teeth of the CCD patient. CONCLUSION: The presumption of cellular cementum is essential for tooth eruption is not supported by the findings of the present study. Delayed exception could be attributed to various other factors like mechanical obstruction, reduced serum alkaline phosphatase levels etc. Also, the significance of the increased percentage of the gap type of C-E junctions and its role in tooth eruption has to be further evaluated.",M2
18774080,"Development of the curve of Spee.INTRODUCTION: Ferdinand Graf von Spee is credited with characterizing human occlusal curvature viewed in the sagittal plane. This naturally occurring phenomenon has clinical importance in orthodontics and restorative dentistry, yet we have little understanding of when, how, or why it develops. The purpose of this study was to expand our understanding by examining the development of the curve of Spee longitudinally in a sample of untreated subjects with normal occlusion from the deciduous dentition to adulthood. METHODS: Records of 16 male and 17 female subjects from the Iowa Facial Growth Study were selected and examined. The depth of the curve of Spee was measured on their study models at 7 time points from ages 4 (deciduous dentition) to 26 (adult dentition) years. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare changes in the curve of Spee depth between time points. For each subject, the relative <e>eruption</e> of the mandibular teeth was measured from corresponding cephalometric radiographs, and its contribution to the developing curve of Spee was ascertained. RESULTS: In the deciduous dentition, the curve of Spee is minimal. At mean ages of 4.05 and 5.27 years, the average curve of Spee depths are 0.24 and 0.25 mm, respectively. With change to the transitional dentition, corresponding to the eruption of the mandibular permanent first molars and central incisors (mean age, 6.91 years), the curve of Spee depth increases significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) to a mean maximum depth of 1.32 mm. The curve of Spee then remains essentially unchanged until eruption of the second molars (mean age, 12.38 years), when the depth increases (P &lt; 0.0001) to a mean maximum depth of 2.17 mm. In the adolescent dentition (mean age, 16.21 years), the depth decreases slightly (P = 0.0009) to a mean maximum depth of 1.98 mm, and, in the adult dentition (mean age 26.98 years), the curve remains unchanged (P = 0.66), with a mean maximum depth of 2.02 mm. No significant differences in curve of Spee development were found between either the right and left sides of the mandibular arch or the sexes. Radiographic measurements of tooth eruption confirm that the greatest increases in the curve of Spee occur as the mandibular permanent incisors, first molars, or second molars erupt above the pre-existing occlusal plane. CONCLUSIONS: On average, the curve of Spee initially develops as a result of mandibular permanent first molar and incisor eruption. The curve of Spee maintains this depth until the mandibular permanent second molars erupt above the occlusal plane, when it again deepens. During the adolescent dentition stage, the curve depth decreases slightly and then remains relatively stable into early adulthood.",M2
18771899,"Alveolar bone grafting in the treatment of midline alveolar cleft and diastema in incomplete median cleft lip.Median cleft lip is a rare congenital anomaly. The wide diastema with mesial tipping observed in these patients has been largely overlooked. A midline submucosal alveolar cleft prevents adequate treatment. The purpose of this article is to describe an alveolar bone grafting (ABG) technique used in the combined surgical-orthodontic approach to diastema treatment in patients presenting with incomplete median cleft lip. Patients treated for incomplete median cleft lip and diastema were identified in the clinic registry from 1981 to 2007. Six patients were identified; 4 underwent ABG before permanent maxillary incisor <e>eruption</e>, the other 2 were seen later when they were 11 years old. All 6 ABGs were successful. The incisors erupted through the graft or were successfully moved into it with lasting results. Follow-up ranged from 8 to 21 years. The existence of a midline submucosal alveolar cleft and subsequent diastema should be recognized and addressed in all patients who present with incomplete median cleft lip repair. This includes taking maxillary occlusal view X-rays before the age of 5 years to detect the cleft, and proceed to ABG if necessary, generally before permanent maxillary incisor eruption.",M2
18767469,"<e>Eruption</e> chronology of the permanent dentition in Spanish children.BACKGROUND: Little information is available regarding the eruption chronology of Spanish children. Therefore, it is important to acquire accurate eruption parameters for the Spanish population. AIM: To establish the chronology of the permanent dentition. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study based on a sample of 1123 Spanish Caucasian children ranging from 5 to 15 years of age, from three different schools in Barcelona, Spain. RESULTS: The sample is representative of the Spanish population with regards to age, height and weight; and large enough to achieve the desired 95% confidence level. The results appear in the eruption tables included in the body of this paper CONCLUSIONS: In both boys and girls, the lower left central incisor is the first, and the upper right second molar is the last tooth to erupt. Mandibular teeth tend to erupt before the corresponding maxillary teeth; however there is no difference between the left and right sides of each arch. The results obtained are in agreement with similar studies performed in other groups of Caucasian children.",M2
18767468,"<e>Eruption</e> chronology of primary teeth in Nigerian children.The eruption chronology of the primary dentition has been studied in some populations, however; only few studies from Nigeria and other African countries have been reported. OBJECTIVE: To determine the appropriate reference standard for eruption of primary teeth in Nigerian children. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross sectional study consisting of 1,013 clinically healthy babies, infants and preschool children between the ages of 4 to 36 months from the community health centers immunization clinics in Ife Central and Ife East Local Government Areas. RESULTS: Boys erupted primary teeth earlier than girls in both arches except the first molars. However girls had a shorter duration of eruption (from the first tooth to erupt to the last tooth to erupt) when compared to boys. In addition, boys had a systematic tendency for earlier eruption on the left side.CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, a baseline data for eruption of primary teeth among Nigerian children has been established. Nigerian children experienced an earlier eruption of primary teeth when compared to their Arabian and American counterparts and a later eruption when compared to children from Iceland.",M2

18705801,"Expression of endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II in the rat dental follicle and its potential role in tooth <e>eruption</e>.Endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP-II) is an inflammatory cytokine with chemotactic activity. Because the dental follicle (DF) recruits mononuclear cells (osteoclast precursors) to promote the osteoclastogenesis needed for tooth eruption, it was the aim of this study to determine if EMAP-II contributes to this recruitment. Using a DNA microarray, EMAP-II was found to be highly expressed in vivo in the DFs of day 1 to day 11 postnatal rats, with its expression elevated on days 1 and 3. Use of a short interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down EMAP-II expression resulted in a reduction in the expression of colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the DF cells. Addition of EMAP-II protein to the DF cells partially restored the expression of CSF-1 and MCP-1. In chemotaxis assays using either conditioned medium of the DF cells with anti-(EMAP-II) immunoglobulin G added or conditioned medium of DF cells with EMAP-II knocked down by siRNA, migration indexes of bone marrow mononuclear cells were significantly reduced. These results suggest that EMAP-II is another chemotactic molecule in the dental follicle involved in the recruitment of mononuclear cells, and that EMAP-II may exert its chemotactic function directly by recruiting mononuclear cells and indirectly by enhancing the expression of other chemotactic molecules (CSF-1 and MCP-1).",M2

AIM: To monitor 8 year changes of the gingival contour occurring in adolescents and adults and relate these changes to dentofacial growth. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: Forty adolescents (mean age 16.3), and 14 adults (mean age 29.7) were included in the study with photographs, radiographs and casts taken 2 and 10 years after orthodontic treatment. The gingival contour of upper central incisors and the midline passing through the contact surface of both teeth were traced digitally using calibrated photographs. Changes were measured on seven standardized lines of the gingival contour. Lower facial height changes and tooth <e>eruption</e> were measured using lateral cephalograms. RESULTS: Adolescents and adults showed a central mean apical displacement of the gingival margin of 0.51 mm (SD 0.4 mm) and 0.13 mm (SD 0.17 mm), respectively. This displacement decreased by moving away from the centre. The gingival displacement was associated to the individual's lower facial height augmentation, r=0.63 (p&lt;0.001).

18678755,"A possible association between early apical resorption of primary teeth and ectodermal characteristics of the permanent dentition.The hypothesis of this study is that children with unexpected early apical resorption of the primary teeth are also predisposed to resorption in the permanent dentition. Accordingly, the aim was to perform a longitudinal study focussing on the permanent teeth in children with unexpected early apical resorption in the primary dentition. Panoramic radiographs of 12 children (7 boys and 5 girls) aged 6 years 4 months to 8 years 9 months with unexpected early apical resorption of primary teeth were identified from a dental archive of 588 patients. After written request, follow-up radiographs were obtained (2-15 year interval between early and follow-up radiographs). The radiographs were examined in order to verify the abnormal resorption pattern of the primary teeth and dental deviations in the permanent teeth, known to predispose for root resorption (i.e. invaginations, narrow crowns, abrupt root deflections, slender roots, short roots, taurodontia, agenesis, deviant pattern of <e>eruption</e>). Primary dentition: Two phenotypically different resorption groups were identified: group I, eight patients (resorption of the roots only), and group II, four patients (resorption of root and crown). Permanent dentition: In all 12 children, dental deviations in the permanent dentition were observed. Additionally, idiopathic external apical resorption of the permanent teeth was seen in three children, two of whom had received orthodontic treatment.",M2
18672999,"Periostin is essential for the integrity and function of the periodontal ligament during occlusal loading in mice.BACKGROUND: The ability of the periodontal ligament (PDL) to absorb and distribute forces is necessary for periodontal homeostasis. This adaptive response may be determined, in part, by a key molecule, periostin, which maintains the integrity of the PDL during occlusal function and inflammation. Periostin is primarily expressed in the PDL and is highly homologous to betaig-H3 (transforming growth factor-beta [TGF-beta] inducible gene). Cementum, alveolar bone, and the PDL of periostin-null mice dramatically deteriorate following tooth <e>eruption</e>. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of periostin in maintaining the functional integrity of the periodontium. METHODS: The periodontia from periostin-null mice were characterized followed by unloading the incisors. The effect of substrate stretching on periostin expression was evaluated using a murine PDL cell line. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify mRNA levels of periostin and TGF-beta. TGF-beta1 neutralizing antibodies were used to determine whether the effects of substrate stretching on periostin expression are mediated through TGF-beta. RESULTS: Severe periodontal defects were observed in the periostin-null mice after tooth eruption. The removal of masticatory forces in periostin-null mice rescue the periodontal defects. Periostin expression was increased in strained PDL cells by 9.2-fold at 48 hours and was preceded by a transient increase in TGF-beta mRNA in vitro. Elevation of periostin in response to mechanical stress was blocked by the addition of 2.5 ng/ml neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta1, suggesting that mechanical strain activates TGF-beta to have potential autocrine effects and to increase periostin expression. CONCLUSION: Mechanical loading maintains sufficient periostin expression to ensure the integrity of the periodontium in response to occlusal load.",M2
