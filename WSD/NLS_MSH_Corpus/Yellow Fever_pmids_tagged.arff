20305949,"Circulation of antibodies against <e>yellow fever</e> virus in a simian population in the area of Porto Primavera Hydroelectric Plant, São Paulo, Brazil.Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes which occurs in two distinct epidemiological cycles: sylvatic and urban. In the sylvatic cycle, the virus is maintained by monkey's infection and transovarian transmission in vectors. Surveillance of non-human primates is required for the detection of viral circulation during epizootics, and for the identification of unaffected or transition areas. An ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) was standardized for estimation of the prevalence of IgG antibodies against yellow fever virus in monkey sera (Alouatta caraya) from the reservoir area of Porto Primavera Hydroelectric Plant, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. A total of 570 monkey sera samples were tested and none was reactive to antibodies against yellow fever virus. The results corroborate the epidemiology of yellow fever in the area. Even though it is considered a transition area, there were no reports to date of epizootics or yellow fever outbreaks in humans. Also, entomological investigations did not detect the presence of vectors of this arbovirus infection. ELISA proved to be fast, sensitive, an adequate assay, and an instrument for active search in the epidemiological surveillance of yellow fever allowing the implementation of prevention actions, even before the occurrence of epizootics.",M1

20055233,"Medical and agricultural entomology in Brazil: a historical approach.Medical Entomology emerged in Brazil in the late nineteenth century, through the initiative of a group of physicians dedicated to researching microorganisms related to diseases of public health importance, especially <e>yellow fever</e> and malaria. They led the institutionalization of Bacteriology and Tropical Medicine in southeast Brazil and the sanitation of coastal cities and, subsequently, rural areas. Medical Entomology provided the professionals who would undertake campaigns against agricultural plagues, as well as the institutionalization of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine. In the present article, I intend to show how relations between the professionals who gave life to Medical Entomology in Brazil were interwoven and to illustrate their relations with entomologists in other countries. I will also present an overview of the research problems faced by Brazilian entomologists at the turn of the nineteenth century and early decades of the twentieth.",M1
19967234,"[<e>Yellow fever</e>: study of an outbreak]This study had the aim of describing an outbreak of yellow fever that occurred in the municipalities under the jurisdiction of the Regional Healthcare Administration of Diamantina, Minas Gerais, between 2002 and 2003, in which 36 cases were notified. This was an autochthonous outbreak of wild-type yellow fever. Failure of vaccinal coverage and low levels of detection of mild cases were found. Among the cases, 33 (91.7%) were male and the age range was from 16 to 67 years. Nineteen (52.8%) of the cases were classified as severe and 12 men (33.3%) died of the disease. All of the cases came from rural areas and presented fever, headache, vomiting, jaundice, myalgia, oliguria and signs of hemorrhage. Surveillance through laboratory tests was the determining factor in diagnosing the outbreak. By describing the epidemiological and clinic findings, this study contributes towards diagnosing and classifying this disease. It was deduced that there is a relationship between deforestation, and outbreaks, and that there is a potential regional risk of yellow fever because of the local development of tourism.",M1
19950229,"Detection of a new <e>yellow fever</e> virus lineage within the South American genotype I in Brazil.Nucleotide sequences of two regions of the genomes of 11 yellow fever virus (YFV) samples isolated from monkeys or humans with symptomatic yellow fever (YF) in Brazil in 2000, 2004, and 2008 were determined with the objective of establishing the genotypes and studying the genetic variation. Results of the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis showed that sequences generated from strains from 2004 and 2008 formed a new subclade within the clade 1 of the South American genotype I. The new subgroup is here designated as 1E. Sequences of YFV strains recovered in 2000 belong to the subclade 1D, which comprises previously characterized YFV strains from Brazil. Molecular dating analyses suggested that the new subclade 1E started diversifying from 1D about 1975 and that the most recent 2004-2008 isolates arose about 1985.",M1

19893892,"Membrane and envelope virus proteins co-expressed as lysosome associated membrane protein (LAMP) fused antigens: a potential tool to develop DNA vaccines against flaviviruses.Vaccination is the most practical and cost-effective strategy to prevent the majority of the flavivirus infection to which there is an available vaccine. However, vaccines based on attenuated virus can potentially promote collateral side effects and even rare fatal reactions. Given this scenario, the development of alternative vaccination strategies such as DNA-based vaccines encoding specific flavivirus sequences are being considered. Endogenous cytoplasmic antigens, characteristically plasmid DNA-vaccine encoded, are mainly presented to the immune system through Major Histocompatibility Complex class I - MHC I molecules. The MHC I presentation via is mostly associated with a cellular cytotoxic response and often do not elicit a satisfactory humoral response. One of the main strategies to target DNA-encoded antigens to the MHC II compartment is expressing the antigen within the Lysosome-Associated Membrane Protein (LAMP). The flavivirus envelope protein is recognized as the major virus surface protein and the main target for neutralizing antibodies. Different groups have demonstrated that co-expression of flavivirus membrane and envelope proteins in mammalian cells, fused with the carboxyl-terminal of LAMP, is able to induce satisfactory levels of neutralizing antibodies. Here we reviewed the use of the envelope flavivirus protein co-expression strategy as LAMP chimeras with the aim of developing DNA vaccines for dengue, West Nile and <e>yellow fever</e> viruses.",M1
19889759,"<e>Yellow fever</e> virus exhibits slower evolutionary dynamics than dengue virus.Although yellow fever has historically been one of the most important viral infections of humans, relatively little is known about the evolutionary processes that shape its genetic diversity. Similarly, there is limited information on the molecular epidemiology of yellow fever virus (YFV) in Africa even though it most likely first emerged on this continent. Through an analysis of complete E gene sequences, including a newly acquired viral collection from Central and West Africa (Senegal, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, and Mauritania), we show that YFV exhibits markedly lower rates of evolutionary change than dengue virus, despite numerous biological similarities between these two viruses. From this observation, along with a lack of clock-like evolutionary behavior in YFV, we suggest that vertical transmission, itself characterized by lower replication rates, may play an important role in the evolution of YFV in its enzootic setting. Despite a reduced rate of nucleotide substitution, phylogenetic patterns and estimates of times to common ancestry in YFV still accord well with the dual histories of colonialism and the slave trade, with areas of sylvatic transmission (such as Kedougou, Senegal) acting as enzootic/epidemic foci.",M1
19846669,"Identification of a dominant endoplasmic reticulum-retention signal in <e>yellow fever</e> virus pre-membrane protein.Yellow fever virus (YFV) encodes two envelope proteins, pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E), that accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The C termini of prM and E form two antiparallel transmembrane alpha-helices that contain ER-retention signals. To understand further the ER retention of the prME heterodimer, we characterized the subcellular localization of chimeric proteins made of a reporter protein fused to the transmembrane segments of YFV envelope proteins. We showed that at least three of the transmembrane segments of the prME heterodimer are ER-retention signals. Interestingly, increasing the length of these alpha-helices led to the export of the chimeric proteins out of the ER. Furthermore, adding a diacidic export signal at the C terminus of the first transmembrane segment of the E protein also induced export to the cell surface. However, adding this export signal at the C terminus of the first transmembrane segment of E in the context of prME did not change the subcellular localization of the prME heterodimer, suggesting the presence of a stronger ER-retention signal outside the first transmembrane segment of E. Importantly, the diacidic export motif added to the C terminus of the first transmembrane segment of the prM protein was not sufficient to export a chimeric protein out of the ER, indicating that this sequence is a dominant ER-retention signal. Together, these data indicate that a combination of several signals of different strengths contributes to the ER retention of the YFV envelope protein heterodimer.",M1
19753115,"Characterization of an enantioselective odorant receptor in the <e>yellow fever</e> mosquito Aedes aegypti.Enantiomers differ only in the left or right handedness (chirality) of their orientations and exhibit identical chemical and physical properties. In chemical communication systems, enantiomers can be differentially active at the physiological and behavioral levels. Only recently were enantioselective odorant receptors demonstrated in mammals while their existence in insects has remained hypothetical. Using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp of Xenopus oocytes, we show that the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, odorant receptor 8 (AaOR8) acts as a chiral selective receptor for the (R)-(-)-enantiomer of 1-octen-3-ol, which in the presence of other kairomones is an attractant used by blood-sucking insects to locate their hosts. In addition to steric constraints, chain length and degree of unsaturation play important roles in this recognition process. This is the first characterization of an enantioselective odorant receptor in insects and the results demonstrate that an OR alone, without helper proteins, can account for chiral specificity exhibited by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs).",M1
19722082,"Ecology of Haemagogus sp. and Sabethes sp. (Diptera: Culicidae) in relation to the microclimates of the Caxiuanã National Forest, Pará, Brazil.This study was conducted in a meteorological tower located in the Caxiuanã Forest (municipality of Melgaço, Pará, Brazil) with the aim of assessing the vertical stratification of species of Haemagogus and Sabethes, potential vectors of the <e>yellow fever</e> virus. To investigate the role of microclimates in mosquito stratification, bimonthly collections were conducted at ground level (0 m), 8 m, 16 m and 30 m (canopy level), with the aid of entomological nets and suction tubes, from July 2005-April 2006. A total of 25,498 mosquitoes were collected; specimens of Sabethes sp. and Haemagogus janthinomyswere found mostly at heights of 16 m and 30 m while Hg. leucocelaenus was most frequently observed at ground level. The largest number of vector species was collected during the rainiest months, but this difference between seasons was not statistically significant. However, the number of Hg. janthinomys was positively correlated with variations in temperature and relative humidity.",M1
19648402,"Serotonin-induced high intracellular pH aids in alkali secretion in the anterior midgut of larval <e>yellow fever</e> mosquito Aedes aegypti L.The anterior midgut of the larval yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti generates a luminal pH in excess of 10 in vivo and similar values are attained by isolated and perfused anterior midgut segments after stimulation with submicromolar serotonin. In the present study we investigated the mechanisms of strong luminal alkalinization using the intracellular fluorescent indicator BCECF-AM. Following stimulation with serotonin, we observed that intracellular pH (pH(i)) of the anterior midgut increased from a mean of 6.89 to a mean of 7.62, whereas pH(i) of the posterior midgut did not change in response to serotonin. Moreover, a further increase of pH(i) to 8.58 occurred when the pH of the luminal perfusate was raised to an in vivo-like value of 10.0. Luminal Zn(2+) (10 micromol l(-1)), an inhibitor of conductive proton pathways, did not inhibit the increase in pH(i), the transepithelial voltage, or the capacity of the isolated tissue to alkalinize the lumen. Finally, the transapical voltage did not significantly respond to luminal pH changes induced either by perfusion with pH 10 or by stopping the luminal perfusion with unbuffered solution which results in spontaneous luminal alkalinization. Together, these results seem to rule out the involvement of conductive pathways for proton absorption across the apical membrane and suggest that a serotonin-induced alkaline pH(i) plays an important role in the generation of an alkaline lumen.",M1
19597548,"Assessment of <e>yellow fever</e> epidemic risk: an original multi-criteria modeling approach.BACKGROUND: Yellow fever (YF) virtually disappeared in francophone West African countries as a result of YF mass vaccination campaigns carried out between 1940 and 1953. However, because of the failure to continue mass vaccination campaigns, a resurgence of the deadly disease in many African countries began in the early 1980s. We developed an original modeling approach to assess YF epidemic risk (vulnerability) and to prioritize the populations to be vaccinated. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We chose a two-step assessment of vulnerability at district level consisting of a quantitative and qualitative assessment per country. Quantitative assessment starts with data collection on six risk factors: five risk factors associated with  exposure  to virus/vector and one with  susceptibility  of a district to YF epidemics. The multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) modeling method was specifically adapted to reduce the five exposure variables to one aggregated exposure indicator. Health districts were then projected onto a two-dimensional graph to define different levels of vulnerability. Districts are presented on risk maps for qualitative analysis in consensus groups, allowing the addition of factors, such as population migrations or vector density, that could not be included in MCA. The example of rural districts in Burkina Faso show five distinct clusters of risk profiles. Based on this assessment, 32 of 55 districts comprising over 7 million people were prioritized for preventive vaccination campaigns. CONCLUSION: This assessment of yellow fever epidemic risk at the district level includes MCA modeling and consensus group modification. MCA provides a standardized way to reduce complexity. It supports an informed public health decision-making process that empowers local stakeholders through the consensus group. This original approach can be applied to any disease with documented risk factors.",M1
19585894,"[Entomological investigation following the re-emergence of <e>yellow fever</e> in 2008 in Abidjan area (Côte d'Ivoire)]In April 2008, Abidjan was again faced with another case of yellow fever after the epidemic of 2001 causing mass immunization campaign. In order to evaluate the extent of amaril virus circulation and the risk for local people, an entomological investigation was carried out by the Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene of Côte d'Ivoire. At  Entent  area of Treichville, Breteau index was estimated at 34, recipient index at 20% and house index at 25%. Those indexes were respectively 53, 21 and 31% at  Vridi canal  of Port Bouet. In the both neighborhood, Aedes aegypti accounted for more than 80% of mosquitoes caught and more than 90% of mosquitoes adults obtained from larval breeding. This new situation of epidemic risk could be explained by several factors including the reception of 70% of forced migration people caused by the crisis in the country occurred in 2002, the probable drop of preventive immunization, the environment deterioration creating of more breeding sites of Ae. aegypti.",M1

The objective of this study was to describe and analyze the epidemic of 1870 by using the available mortality data. METHODS: The information on 1,235 deaths identified in the parochial registries was analyzed, using statistical and epidemiological procedures for epidemic outbreaks. RESULTS: Mortality due to yellow fever was 549.7 per 100,000 inhabitants. The temporal distribution of the deaths showed two peaks at the end of September and October with the last fatalities occurring in December 1870. The distribution of the fatalities in the city's neighborhoods was unequal. In La Barceloneta, in particular, more fatalities were found in the streets adjacent to the port than in the most remote streets (r=0.83; p&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a temporal bimodal mortality distribution for yellow fever during the outbreak, with a high impact in adult men and in the La Barceloneta neighborhood.",M1
19193723,"NHE8 is an intracellular cation/H+ exchanger in renal tubules of the <e>yellow fever</e> mosquito Aedes aegypti.The goal of this study was to identify and characterize the hypothesized apical cation/H(+) exchanger responsible for K(+) and/or Na(+) secretion in the renal (Malpighian) tubules of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. From Aedes Malpighian tubules, we cloned  AeNHE8,  a full-length cDNA encoding an ortholog of mammalian Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 8 (NHE8). The expression of AeNHE8 transcripts is ubiquitous among mosquito tissues and is not enriched in Malpighian tubules. Western blots of Malpighian tubules suggest that AeNHE8 is expressed primarily as an intracellular protein, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical localizations in Malpighian tubules. AeNHE8 immunoreactivity is expressed in principal cells of the secretory, distal segments, where it localizes to a subapical compartment (e.g., vesicles or endosomes), but not in the apical brush border. Furthermore, feeding mosquitoes a blood meal or treating isolated tubules with dibutyryl-cAMP, both of which stimulate a natriuresis by Malpighian tubules, do not influence the intracellular localization of AeNHE8 in principal cells. When expressed heterologously in Xenopus laevis oocytes, AeNHE8 mediates EIPA-sensitive Na/H exchange, in which Li(+) partially and K(+) poorly replace Na(+). The expression of AeNHE8 in Xenopus oocytes is associated with the development of a conductive pathway that closely resembles the known endogenous nonselective cation conductances of Xenopus oocytes. In conclusion, AeNHE8 does not mediate cation/H(+) exchange in the apical membrane of Aedes Malpighian tubules; it is more likely involved with an intracellular function.",M1
19169857,"RNA interference inhibits <e>yellow fever</e> virus replication in vitro and in vivo.RNA interference (RNAi) is a process that is induced by double stranded RNA and involves the degradation of specific sequences of mRNA in the cytoplasm of the eukaryotic cells. It has been used as an antiviral tool against many viruses, including flaviviruses. The genus Flavivirus contains the most important arboviruses in the world, i.e., dengue (DENV) and yellow fever (YFV). In our study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo effect of RNAi against YFV. Using stable cell lines that expressed RNAi against YFV, the cell lines were able to inhibit as much as 97% of the viral replication. Two constructions (one against NS1 and the other against E region of YFV genome) were able to protect the adult Balb/c mice against YFV challenge. The histopathologic analysis demonstrated an important protection of the central nervous system by RNAi after 10 days of viral challenge. Our data suggests that RNAi is a potential viable therapeutic weapon against yellow fever.",M1

19086001,"Larvicidal and oviposition-altering activity of monoterpenoids, trans-anithole and rosemary oil to the <e>yellow fever</e> mosquito Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae).BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti L. is the major vector of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. In an effort to find effective tools for control programs to reduce mosquito populations, the authors assessed the acute toxicities of 14 monoterpenoids, trans-anithole and the essential oil of rosemary against different larval stages of Ae. aegypti. The potential for piperonyl butoxide (PBO) to act as a synergist for these compounds to increase larvicidal activity was also examined, and the oviposition response of gravid Ae. aegypti females to substrates containing these compounds was evaluated in behavioral bioassays. RESULTS: Pulegone, thymol, eugenol, trans-anithole, rosemary oil and citronellal showed high larvicidal activity against all larval stages of Ae. aegypti (LC(50) values 10.3-40.8 mg L(-1)). The addition of PBO significantly increased the larvicidal activity of all test compounds (3-250-fold). Eugenol, citronellal, thymol, pulegone, rosemary oil and cymene showed oviposition deterrent and/or repellent activities, while the presence of borneol, camphor and beta-pinene increased the number of eggs laid in test containers. CONCLUSIONS: This study quantified the lethal and sublethal effects of several phytochemical compounds against all larval stages of Aedes aegypti, providing information that ultimately may have potential in mosquito control programs through acute toxicity and/or the ability to alter reproductive behaviors.",M1

18977438,"Aedes FADD: a novel death domain-containing protein required for antibacterial immunity in the <e>yellow fever</e> mosquito, Aedes aegypti.Microbial infections in insects activate a series of immune responses that culminate in the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In Drosophila, two signaling pathways, govern the challenge-dependent expression of AMPs; the Toll and IMD pathways. While AMPs have been the subject of much research in mosquitoes, the regulation of the pathways required for AMP expression remains largely unknown. We report here the identification of Aedes FADD (AeFADD), a death domain protein in Aedes aegypti. AeFadd is expressed in all immune-competent tissues and all developmental stages examined. At the transcriptional level, AeFadd transcripts increased when challenged with Escherichia coli but not Micrococcus luteus. In both cases, we observed the induction of two AMP genes; cecropin and defensin. Loss of AeFadd function by dsRNA interference impaired the inducible expression of both AMPs, and rendered adult mosquitoes susceptible to both types of bacteria. Identifying molecules that regulate mosquito immunity may help elucidate the factors that contribute to the vectorial capacity and provide insights into general mechanisms that regulate innate immunity.",M1
18955536,"Activity of T-705 in a hamster model of <e>yellow fever</e> virus infection in comparison with that of a chemically related compound, T-1106.Treatment with the nucleoside analog T-1106 was previously shown to be effective in a hamster model of yellow fever virus (YFV) disease, even though it had only slight activity in cell culture. In the study described in this report, the activity of T-705, a chemically related compound currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of influenza (FDANews 4:1, 2007), was tested against YFV in cell culture and in the hamster model. The antiviral efficacy of T-705 in cell culture occurred at a concentration of 330 microM, which was more than threefold lower than the concentration at which T-1106 had antiviral efficacy, as determined by a virus yield reduction assay and confirmed by a luciferase-based ATP detection assay. Time-of-addition studies revealed that addition of T-705, T-1106, or ribavirin at 0, 4, 8, or 12 h after virus challenge was effective in inhibiting virus in Vero cells, suggesting that these three agents have similar mechanisms of action in cell culture. Because of its more potent activity in cell culture, it was anticipated that T-705 treatment of hamsters infected with YFV would result in protection from disease. Significant improvements in survival and disease parameters were seen in infected animals when T-705 was administered orally at a dose of 200 or 400 mg/kg of body weight per day when it was given twice a day for 8 days. Significant improvements were also observed with a dose of 400 mg/kg/day when treatment initiation was delayed as late as 3 days after virus inoculation. Although the dose of T-705 required for efficacy in hamsters is higher than that of T-1106 required for efficacy, T-705 treatment is effective in significantly improving disease parameters in YFV-infected hamsters, which may indicate its potential utility in the treatment of YFV disease in humans.",M1

In this context, Dengue 1-4 and <e>Yellow Fever</e> 17D-204 (YF 17D)-specific CD4 and CD8 cellular responses induced by tetravalent chimeric dengue vaccines (CYD) were analyzed in flavivirus-naive or flavivirus-immune patients. Tetravalent CYD vaccine did not trigger detectable changes in serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, whatever the vaccinees immune status, while inducing significant YF 17D NS3-specific CD8 responses and dengue serotype-specific T helper responses. These responses were dominated by serotype 4 in naive individuals, but a booster vaccination (dose #2) performed 4 months following dose #1 broadened serotype-specific responses. A similar, broader response was seen after primary tetravalent immunization in subjects with pre-existing dengue 1 or 2 immunity caused by prior monovalent live-attenuated dengue vaccination. In all three trials, the profile of induced response was similar, whatever the subjects' immune status, i.e. an absence of Th2 response, and an IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha ratio dominated by IFN-gamma, for both CD4 and CD8 responses. Our results also showed an absence of cross-reactivity between YF 17D or Dengue NS3-specific CD8 responses, and allowed the identification of 3 new CD8 epitopes in the YF 17D NS3 antigen.

18754398,"Bleedings, purges, and vomits: Dr. Benjamin Rush's republican medicine, the bilious remitting <e>yellow-fever</e> epidemic of 1793, and the non-origin of the law of informed consent.To the consternation of many physicians, the modern law of informed consent imposes certain constraints on their actions, not least that they respect patients' decisions to redefine at will the scope of care. The consequences of this transfer of power are often a nuisance and occasionally fatal, but always a reflection of democracy's leveling march: Physicians now take orders rather than give them. However frustrating the modern preference for process over result might be, we should ask ourselves-before condemning the law's evolution-about the consequences for patients' health of a more radically democratic practice of medicine. This paper proposes to examine this question as framed by the life of Dr. Benjamin Rush, who, in addition to signing the Declaration of Independence, crafted a medical practice uniquely suited to the young Republic's presumed moral character: Self-aware sufferers would promptly identify their own maladies and courageously treat themselves. In the end, his enterprise was flawed because his democratic instincts misled not only his scientific inquiries (disease is complex, not simple) but also his practice recommendations (patients are scared, not intrepid). Reflection on Rush's failed project should give pause to those who lament the passing of paternalistic medicine, for the law's requirements, however onerous they might be, tolerably accommodate both patients' need for physicians' expertise and our democratic belief that consent is the fundamental precondition of all rule.",M1

18721469,"Three-dimensional visualization of cultural clusters in the 1878 <e>yellow fever</e> epidemic of New Orleans.BACKGROUND: An epidemic may exhibit different spatial patterns with a change in geographic scale, with each scale having different conduits and impediments to disease spread. Mapping disease at each of these scales often reveals different cluster patterns. This paper will consider this change of geographic scale in an analysis of yellow fever deaths for New Orleans in 1878. Global clustering for the whole city, will be followed by a focus on the French Quarter, then clusters of that area, and finally street-level patterns of a single cluster. The three-dimensional visualization capabilities of a GIS will be used as part of a cluster creation process that incorporates physical buildings in calculating mortality-to-mortality distance. Including nativity of the deceased will also capture cultural connection. RESULTS: Twenty-two yellow fever clusters were identified for the French Quarter. These generally mirror the results of other global cluster and density surfaces created for the entire epidemic in New Orleans. However, the addition of building-distance, and disease specific time frame between deaths reveal that disease spread contains a cultural component. Same nativity mortality clusters emerge in a similar time frame irrespective of proximity. Italian nativity mortalities were far more densely grouped than any of the other cohorts. A final examination of mortalities for one of the nativity clusters reveals that further sub-division is present, and that this pattern would only be revealed at this scale (street level) of investigation. CONCLUSION: Disease spread in an epidemic is complex resulting from a combination of geographic distance, geographic distance with specific connection to the built environment, disease-specific time frame between deaths, impediments such as herd immunity, and social or cultural connection. This research has shown that the importance of cultural connection may be more important than simple proximity, which in turn might mean traditional quarantine measures should be re-evaluated.",M1
18645665,"[Presence of Haemagogus equinus Theobald, 1903 (Diptera: Culicidae), in Soledad and Malambo, in the Province of Atlántico, Colombia]INTRODUCTION: <e>Yellow fever</e> is a serious illness public health importance and is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genera Haemagogus and Sabethes in the rural and forest environments, and by Aedes aegypti in the urban setting. In Colombia, Haemagogus janthinomys and H. equinus are considered efficient vectors of this viral disease. OBJECTIVE: The presence of the mosquito Haemagogus equinus was recorded over an 8 year period, in the periurban areas of the Soledad and Malambo municipalities (Atlantico Province) of northern Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data was obtained from records of the entomological collections from two collection sites: (1) 14 larva traps located at the Erneasto Cortissoz airport in the municipality of Soledad between 1997--2005 and (2) 10 larva traps located at Vergara and Velasco Batallion in the municipality of Malambo in 2005. RESULTS: Haemogogus equinus was reported for the first time in Soledad in 1998. In the following 8 years, 197 larvae were reported. The individuals were found sharing the trap with Aedes aegypti, Culex nigripalpus and Uranotaenia lowii. In Malambo, the first discovery of H.equinus occurred in 2005, with a total of 641 larvae. No other Culicidae were associated with it. CONCLUSION: The presence of H. equinus in larvitraps located near the urban zone, shows adaptation to the use of artificial containers as larval habitats, Urbanization of this species in zones with a high Ae. aegypti infestation index increases the potential introduction of sylvan yellow fever virus and constitutes a risk for re-emergence of urban cycles of yellow fever.",M1

The natural history of YFV has been well described, especially in West Africa, but in East Africa yellow fever (YF) remains characterised by unpredictable focal periodicity and a precarious potential for large epidemics. Recent outbreaks of YF in Kenya (1992-1993) and Sudan (2003 and 2005) are important because each of these outbreaks have involved the re-emergence of a YFV genotype (East Africa) that remained undetected for nearly 40 years and was previously unconfirmed in a clinically apparent outbreak. In addition, unlike West Africa and South America, YF has yet to emerge in urban areas of East Africa and be vectored by Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti. This is a significant public health concern in a region where the majority of the population remains unvaccinated. This review describes historical findings, highlights a number of disease indicators, and provides clarification regarding the natural history, recent emergence and future risk of YF in East Africa.",M1
18549956,"A transgenic sensor strain for monitoring the RNAi pathway in the <e>yellow fever</e> mosquito, Aedes aegypti.The RNA interference pathway functions as an antiviral defense in invertebrates. In order to generate a phenotypic marker which  senses  the status of the RNAi pathway in Aedes aegypti, transgenic strains were developed to express EGFP and DsRED marker genes in the eye, as well as double-stranded RNA homologous to a portion of the EGFP gene. Transgenic  sensor  mosquitoes exhibited robust eye-specific DsRED expression with little EGFP, indicating RNAi-based silencing. Cloning and high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs confirmed that the inverted-repeat transgene was successfully processed into short-interfering RNAs by the mosquito RNAi pathway. When the A. aegypti homologues of the genes DCR-2 or AGO-2 were knocked down, a clear increase in EGFP fluorescence was observed in the mosquito eyes. Knockdown of DCR-2 was also associated with an increase in EGFP mRNA levels, as determined by Northern blot and real-time PCR. Knockdown of AGO-3, a gene involved in the germline-specific piRNA pathway, did not restore EGFP expression at either the mRNA or protein level. This transgenic sensor strain can now be used to identify other components of the mosquito RNAi pathway and has the potential to be used in the identification of arboviral suppressors of RNAi.",M1

Knowledge on the existence of disease vectors in these remote and relatively inaccessible locations could improve epidemiologic understanding and control capabilities. This study identifies mosquito species, their relative abundance and physicochemical characteristics of breeding microhabitats in rock pools on four inselbergs in northern Nigeria. METHODS: Soup ladle dipper was used to obtain representative samples of larval mosquitoes breeding in 141 rock pools on four inselbergs. Physicochemical parameters (depth, electrical conductivity, pH, surface area, temperature and total dissolved solids) of the pools were determined. Larvae were preserved in 70% alcohol and identified microscopically to species using taxonomic keys. Statistical correlation analysis and ANOVA were used to test the associations between physicochemical parameters and mosquito abundance, and for differences amongst inselbergs. RESULTS: Of 2991 larvae, five species of mosquito distributed in three genera (Anopheles, Aedes and Culex) including Ae. vittatus (92.88%), An. ardensis (0.13%), An. distinctus (1.67%), An. wilsoni (0.13%) and Cx. ingrami (5.18%) bred in the rock pools, Up to five species occurred per pool in various conspecific and heterogeneric combinations. Except for Ae. vittatus, the physicochemical parameters of the pools correlate significantly with species abundance. CONCLUSION: Ae. vittatus, a potential vector of <e>yellow fever</e> in Nigeria breeds profusely in rock pools on inselbergs around Zaria.

Appropriate surveillance with sensitive laboratory techniques is necessary to evidence viral activity in the tropical forest habitats of these primates. OBJECTIVE: Yellow fever virus was detected in hepatic tissue samples from non-human primates by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique using specific primers for diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hepatic tissue samples were processed from five monkeys belonging genus Alouatta spp found dead in sylvatic areas of Cesar and Magdalena Provinces, Colombia, between December 2003 and June 2004. Samples were treated with lysis buffer prior to the isolation of viral RNA, which was then subjected to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using yellow fever-specific primers. Simultaneously, viral proteins were identified by immunohistochemistry on parafin-embedded hepatic tissue. RESULTS: The PCR method amplified fragments of the expected size (424 bp) in four of the tested samples. In addition, these samples showed a positive reaction by immunohistochemistry, supporting the evidence that the virus was present. CONCLUSION: The detection of yellow fever virus in wild monkeys was clear evidence of enzootic activity in northern Colombia. Increased probability of yellow fever transmission among human populations is indicated due to urbanization processes as a consequence of forced migration and displacement of the human populations. Molecular tests for rapid and specific detection of yellow fever in tissue samples of non-human primates is an important tool for epidemiologic surveillance. Rapid virus identification will permit the timely activation of control systems for prevention of further cases and epidemic situations.",M1

18252247,"Annotation and expression profiling of apoptosis-related genes in the <e>yellow fever</e> mosquito, Aedes aegypti.Apoptosis has been extensively studied in Drosophila by both biochemical and genetic approaches, but there is a lack of knowledge about the mechanisms of apoptosis regulation in other insects. In mosquitoes, apoptosis occurs during Plasmodium and arbovirus infection in the midgut, suggesting that apoptosis plays a role in mosquito innate immunity. We searched the Aedes aegypti genome for apoptosis-related genes using Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae protein sequences as queries. In this study we have identified eleven caspases, three inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, a previously unreported IAP antagonist, and orthologs of Drosophila Ark, Dnr1, and BG4 (also called dFadd). While most of these genes have been previously annotated, we have improved the annotation of several of them, and we also report the discovery of four previously unannotated apoptosis-related genes. We examined the developmental expression profile of these genes in Ae. aegypti larvae, pupae and adults, and we also studied the function of a novel IAP antagonist, IMP. Expression of IMP in mosquito cells caused apoptosis, indicating that it is a functional pro-death protein. Further characterization of these genes will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis regulation in Ae. aegypti.",M1

We sought to identify mRGPs of the <e>yellow fever</e> mosquito, Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue and yellow fever viruses. Earlier studies with Ae. aegypti demonstrated that  matrone  (a partially purified male reproductive accessory gland substance) or male accessory gland fluid injected into virgin female Ae. aegypti affect female sexual refractoriness, blood feeding and digestion, flight, ovarian development, and oviposition. Using bioinformatic comparisons to Drosophila melanogaster accessory gland proteins and mass spectrometry of proteins from Ae. aegypti male accessory glands and ejaculatory ducts (AG/ED) and female reproductive tracts, we identified 63 new putative Ae. aegypti mRGPs. Twenty-one of these proteins were found in the reproductive tract of mated females but not of virgin females suggesting that they are transferred from males to females during mating. Most of the putative mRGPs fall into the same protein classes as mRGPs in other organisms, although some appear to be evolving rapidly and lack identifiable homologs in Culex pipiens, Anopheles gambiae, and D. melanogaster.

18061688,"Treatment of <e>yellow fever</e>.Yellow fever (YF) is a life-threatening mosquito-borne flaviviral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) characterized by severe hepatitis, renal failure, hemorrhage, and rapid terminal events with shock and multi-organ failure. A live, attenuated vaccine (YF 17D), in wide use for over 60 years, causes a disease identical to wild-type virus at an incidence of 2.5x10(-6). Our current understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of YF (described in this brief review) is derived from studies of animal models (macaques, hamsters) that reproduce the features of human YF and from descriptive studies of human cases of naturally acquired and vaccine-associated VHF. The least understood, but potentially most important terminal events appear to be due to 'cytokine storm' and represent a potential target for therapeutic interventions. Areas for future study include dissection of cytokine-mediated events in animal models, the pathogenic role of the profound neutrophilia that occurs pre-terminally, the (pathological) role of adaptive immune clearance in pathogenesis, and treatments directed at cytokine storm. Antibody, interferon-alpha, polyICLC and other immune modulators are highly effective when administered before or within a narrow time window after infection, but are ineffective when given after the infection is established. A few antivirals have been evaluated (ribavirin, tiazofurin, carboxamide, pyrazoline compounds). Ribavirin has been used successfully to treat hamsters when the drug is given at high doses up to 2 days after virus infection (shortly before liver infection), but has not shown promise in nonhuman primate models. Future work should focus on evaluating higher doses of ribavirin alone or in combinations with potentially synergistic drugs, including interferons. Also specific inhibitors against other flaviviruses such as dengue virus should be investigated for potential pan-flavivirus activity since recent studies have shown that specific targets such as the flavivirus proteases and helicases are very similar in structure.",M1

The literature provides little data on the frequency of these risk groups in the travel population. This study intended to investigate whether risk factors influencing standard travel advice are common in the population attending our travel clinic. METHODS: A prospective survey was carried out over a 2-month period in 2004 at the travel clinic of the Institute for Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium. A list of risk factors focused on the following three important advice categories: malaria prophylaxis, <e>yellow fever</e> vaccination, and travelers' diarrhea or other enteric infections. We counted how frequently a risk factor was observed for each advice category (potential influence) and, after considering the travel characteristics, how often a real adaptation of advice was necessary (actual influence). RESULTS: Of 2,227 travelers, 276 were found to have a possible influencing factor (12.4%). The potential influence was 10.9% (243/2,227) for malaria prophylaxis advice, 6.1% (136/2,227) for yellow fever vaccination, and 1.9% (43/2,227) for travelers' diarrhea advice. The actual influence was lower 8% (184/2,227), 5% (109/2,227), and 1.2% (27/2,227), respectively. The main interfering factors were as follows: for influence on malaria advice, age&gt;or=60 years (44%) and neuropsychiatric disorders (15.6%); for yellow fever vaccination, age&gt;or=60 years (63.2%) and immunosuppression (10.3%); and for influence on travelers' diarrhea advice, decreased gastric acidity (44.2%) and immunosuppression (32.6%).

The integrated approach of human and entomological surveillance was conducted for 2 years (2003-2004). Surveillance in human population was based on screening samples of YF suspected cases (i.e. patients with acute (&lt; or = 15 days) febrile illness with jaundice) for YF specific IgM antibodies. The entomological surveillance was carried out by collecting mosquitoes using human landing catch method and attempt to detect YF virus on them by RT-PCR. Forty five percent of the healthcare centres notified at least one suspected YF case during 2003-2004 periods. Among the 342 sera collected over 2 years, 2 revealed anti-YF IgM antibodies leading to investigations which allowed identification of the source and place of infection and implementation of a reactive focused YF immunization campaign.

RT-PCR was found more sensitive and rapid than viral isolation for YF virus detection in mosquitoes. The pilot study in Senegal for YF surveillance integrating human and entomological parameters in domestic and sylvatic areas showed that this approach is very efficient in detecting yellow fever virus circulation due to the complementarity of the two systems. Therefore, in the light of the encouraging results presented herein, similar studies in different context and areas are needed to further validate and allow the extension of its application to other endemic regions of Africa.",M1

The pattern and distribution of liver cell death as well as ballooning degeneration and midzonal apoptotic bodies were the most distinctive features of YF, whereas morula cells were the major finding for LH. Nineteen well characterised cases were further submitted to immunohistochemical studies for expression of YF antigen, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and delta virus antigen. In both diseases, but particularly in LH, portal vein branch phlebitis was evident and might have played a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic injury, leading to hepatic extinction and portal tract approximation. The regeneration pattern was remarkable: a high proliferative index was detected in YF, whereas in LH multinucleation and pseudoacinar transformation, associated with portal type I collagen deposition and portal elastic fibre proliferation, was seen. In conclusion, midzonal apoptosis, portal phlebitis and a high proliferative index in patients without evidence of previous liver injury was the dominant picture in YF. On the other hand, LH cases showed extensive, predominantly lytic hepatocytic necrosis, portal and hepatic vein phlebitis and morula cells in patients with a morphological background of chronic liver disease.",M1

The use of transcriptional and translational control DNA elements from genes expressed specifically in the insect germ line to mediate transposition offers possibilities for mitigating some of the concerns about transgene behavior in the target vector species and eliminating effects on nontarget organisms. Here, we describe the successful use of the promoter and untranslated regions from the nanos (nos) orthologous gene of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, to control sex- and tissue-specific expression of exogenously derived mariner MosI transposase-encoding DNA. Transgenic mosquitoes expressed transposase mRNA in abundance near or equal to the endogenous nos transcript and exclusively in the female germ cells. In addition, MosI mRNA was deposited in developing oocytes and localized and maintained at the posterior pole during early embryonic development. Importantly, four of five transgenic lines examined were capable of mobilizing a second MosI transgene into the mosquito genome, indicating that functional transposase was being produced. Thus, the nos control sequences show promise as part of a TE-based gene drive system.",M1

The toxicities of piperidine derivatives were significantly decreased when a benzyl moiety was attached to the carbon of the piperidine ring, with an LD50 value as high as 29.2 microg per mosquito. The toxicity order of three moieties attached to the carbon of the piperidine ring was ethyl- &gt; methyl- &gt; benzyl-derivatives. When the same moiety was attached to the piperidine ring, the carbon position to which the moiety was attached conferred different toxicity and the toxicity order was second carbon &gt; third carbon &gt; fourth carbon. Together, these preliminary results may be useful in guiding further piperidine ring modifications in the development of potential new insecticides.",M1
17420215,"Activity of T-1106 in a hamster model of <e>yellow Fever</e> virus infection.Yellow fever virus (YFV) causes 30,000 deaths worldwide, despite the availability of a vaccine. There are no approved antiviral therapies for the treatment of YFV disease in humans, and, therefore, these studies were designed to investigate the anti-YFV properties of T-1106, a substituted pyrazine, in a hamster model of YFV disease. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment with 100 mg/kg of body weight/day of T-1106 starting 4 h prior to virus inoculation and continuing twice daily through 7 days post-virus inoculation (dpi) resulted in significantly improved survival, alanine aminotransferase levels in the serum, weight gain, and mean day to death. Virus titer in the liver at 4 dpi was significantly reduced in treated animals, as determined by both quantitative real-time PCR and infectious cell culture assay. No toxicity (weight loss or mortality) was observed at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day in sham-infected control animals. The observed minimal effective dose of T-1106 was 32 mg/kg/day administered either by oral or i.p. treatment. Therapeutic treatment was effective in significantly improving survival when T-1106 was administered beginning as late as 4 days after virus challenge with twice-daily treatment for 8 days at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day. With favorable safety, bioavailability, and postviral challenge treatment efficacy, T-1106 was effective in the treatment of disease in hamsters infected with YFV and should be further studied for potential use as a therapy for human YFV disease.",M1

Using infectious clones of disseminating (Asibi) and non-disseminating (17D) yellow fever viruses (YFV), we produced chimeric viruses to evaluate the role of different viral genes in dissemination. Previously, we showed that virus produced from an infectious clone containing the structural genes of 17D in Asibi disseminated from the mosquito midgut at a rate of 31%, indicating that some genetic determinants of dissemination must lie within the non-structural (NS) protein genes or 3' non-coding region (NCR). We chose to investigate the roles of NS2A, NS4B, and the 3'NCR in YFV dissemination. Substitution of the 17D NS2A or NS4B into Asibi significantly attenuated YFV dissemination, demonstrating that this is a multigenic property. There was no difference in dissemination after substitution of the 17D 3'NCR.",M1

Medical and sanitary aspects of a polymorphic disease]Shortly after 1800, the question of the contagiousness of yellow fever was quite a topic. In the Netherlands, as was the case in France, the government feared the introduction of contagious diseases, especially of the yellow fever. This growing fear was prompted by the increasing number of yellow fever appearances in the mediterranean ports of France, Spain and Italy, as well as in some French Atlantic ports. In 1821, Thomassen ai Thuessink (a leading expert on epidemic diseases in the Netherlands), Bernard and Van Stipriaan Luïscius were invited by the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences, Literature and Arts (Amsterdam) to assess two treatises on yellow fever, written by Jean Devkze. Devhze's treatises were meticulously analysed. After careful considerations they took the side of Devhze's opponents, and so was the character of their advice to the Dutch government. As a result, already existing sanitary laws were maintained and were even laid down more strictly. Not until several decades later, the senselessness of the distinction between infectious and contagious (as being used by early nineteenth-century scientists) would be generally admitted, although the earliest rumours were already heard shortly after 1800.",M1

The aim of this study was to determine pharmacists' training, experience, and interest in travel medicine and to assess the technical quality of the information given. METHODS: We sent a postal questionnaire to all pharmacies in the Lisbon area. The technical director or another graduate pharmacist was asked to complete the questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 251 pharmacists participated in the study. Most of them (93.2%) did not have any training in travel medicine, and most of them expressed a wish to be informed and/or updated on this subject. The number of advised travelers was low. The use of repellent, protective clothes, and mosquito bed nets was the most frequent advice on protection against mosquito bites. From a subgroup of 170 pharmacists, 43.5% indicated mefloquine and 44.1% indicated chloroquine as malaria chemoprophylaxis to African countries. A significant association existed between the variables  to indicate mefloquine  and  seeks to be informed/updated on travel medicine.  Those who indicated chloroquine tended to like travel medicine less. Concerning diarrhea prevention and treatment, the consumption of bottled and/or treated water and the administration of antibiotics during the episode were the most reported advice.

16967591,"[The risk of <e>yellow fever</e> in travellers]Yellow fever is a tropical virus disease characterised by high fever, jaundice, heart and kidney failure, and haemorrhagic diathesis. The causative Flavivirus is endemic in parts of tropical Africa and South America and is transmitted among humans and primates by mosquitoes. The chance that an unvaccinated traveller to West Africa will die of yellow fever is estimated at 1:650 to 1:5000 visitors per month of stay, depending on whether an epidemic occurs. Vaccination with the attenuated yellow fever Asibi 17D virus results in limited virus replication in the body and long-term protection due to the formation of neutralising antibodies. Vaccination is contraindicated in immunocompromised persons. Serious disseminated disease and encephalitis due to infection with the vaccine virus strain are seen more often in the elderly. One should therefore refrain from vaccination in persons over 60 years of age when the risk of infection is negligible. In recent years, the number of yellow fever epidemics has risen substantially, particularly in West Africa and the Amazon region. Reintroduction of yellow fever vaccination in childhood vaccination programmes is necessary in endemic areas to turn the tide of increasing outbreaks of yellow fever.",M1

Dengue and yellow fever viruses (DENV and YFV) are transmitted by the same species of mosquito and both can cause haemorrhagic fever symptoms. These viruses are active mainly in regions where expensive and sophisticated technologies are not available. Our objective was to develop a simple, reliable and easy-to-perform method to detect and identify these viruses. METHODS: We slightly modified a generic RT-PCR able to detect the mentioned viruses and other members of this genus: specific primers for each one of these viruses were designed and included in the nested reaction instead of one of the generic ones. The reaction was optimized and viruses are amplified giving rise to bands of different sizes distinguishable in agarose gels. RESULTS: This test is able to detect and identify the four DENVs and YFV to a high level of sensitivity and specificity and can be used with clinical samples. This simple, reliable and easy-to-perform method able to detect and identify dengue 1-4 and YFV can be used in poor endemic countries.",M1

In the present study, 53 liver samples obtained by viscerotomy from patients who died during the course of jungle yellow fever were analyzed. The diagnosis was confirmed by serology, viral isolation and virus-specific immunohistochemistry. The specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies for apoptosis, CD45RO, CD4, CD8, CD20, S100, CD57 and CD68. Quantitative analysis of the labeling pattern showed a clear predominance of the different phenotypes in the portal tract and midzone region of the acini. There was a predominance of T CD4+ lymphocytes, accompanied by the presence of T CD8+ lymphocytes, natural killer cells (CD57), macrophages and antigen-presenting cells (S100). The disproportion between the intensity of inflammation and the degree of hepatic injury was probably due to the intense apoptotic component, which classically does not induce an inflammatory response. The present study demonstrates that, despite the disproportion between injury and inflammation, the cellular immune response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the hepatocytic injury observed in yellow fever, probably as a result of cytolytic actions through mechanisms involving MHC II and the activation of Fas receptors and granzymes/perforins.",M1

They also set up different measures for the control of yellow fever outbreaks which Oswaldo Cruz was inspired by for his campaign against yellow fever. Emile Brumpt implemented the teaching of parasitology at the Faculty of Medicine in São Paulo and contributed to human American trypanosomiasis by defining the transmission of the disease and the cycle of the parasite responsible for it.

This was accompanied by a rapid increase in serum transaminase and bilirubin values, elevation of prothrombin times, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis.

The attenuated YF 17D strain, used in YF vaccine, was derived from the wild-type strain Asibi. Although studies have been done on genetic markers of YF virulence, differentiation of the two strains in terms of host-cell interaction during infection remains elusive. As YF wild-type strains are hepatotropic, we chose a hepatic cell line (HepG2) to study YF virus-host cell interaction. HepG2 cells rapidly produced high titres of infectious viral particles for 17D and Asibi YF strains. However, HepG2 cells were more susceptible to the attenuated 17D virus infection, and only this virus strain induced early apoptosis in these cells. Molecular markers specific for the 17D virus were identified by microarray analysis and confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. As early as 1h postinfection, three genes, (IEX-1, IRF-1, DEC-1) all implicated in apoptosis pathways, were upregulated. Later in infection (48 h) two other genes (HSP70-1A and 1B), expressed in cases of cellular stress, were highly upregulated in 17D-infected HepG2 cells. The early specific upregulation of these cellular genes in HepG2 cells may be considered markers of the 17D virus.

In the liver, one of the main targets of the virus, the infection induces a characteristic midzonal injury characterized by hepatocyte necrosis, apoptosis and steatosis. This characteristics pattern of liver injury in yellow fever is also observed in conditions of low-flow hypoxia and other infections such as dengue and Rift Valley fever. There are no reports in the literature explaining the genesis of this peculiar histopathological pattern in yellow fever. Some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism of this midzonal distribution pattern observed in the liver such as low-flow hypoxia and tropism of the virus toward hepatocytes in this area. These hypotheses are discussed in view of more recent findings regarding the pathogenesis of yellow fever and regarding hepatic physiopathology, and a new hypothesis is proposed: the midzonal necrosis is consequence of action of combined factors mainly the direct cytopathic effect of YFV associated with a potent immune response in which CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and the cytokines, especially TGF-beta, but also TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma play an important role.",M1

A molecular genetic linkage map was constructed using 148 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and six single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) markers. Eighteen AFLP primer combinations were used to genotype two reciprocal F2 segregating populations. Each primer combination generated an average of 8.2 AFLP markers eligible for linkage mapping. The length of the integrated map was 180.9 cM, giving an average marker resolution of 1.2 cM. Composite interval mapping revealed a total of six QTL significantly affecting Plasmodium susceptibility in the two reciprocal crosses of Ae. aegypti. Two common QTL on linkage group 2 were identified in both crosses that had similar effects on the phenotype, and four QTL were unique to each cross. In one cross, the four main QTL accounted for 64% of the total phenotypic variance, and digenic epistasis explained 11.8% of the variance. In the second cross, the four main QTL explained 66% of the variance, and digenic epistasis accounted for 16% of the variance. The actions of these QTL were either dominance or underdominance. Our results indicated that at least three new QTL were mapped on chromosomes 1 and 3.

Class I RNR is a tetramer that consists of two subunits, R1 and R2; enzymatic activity requires association of R1 with R2. The R2 subunit is of special interest because it dictates the interaction with R1 that is required for enzymatic activity expression, and it is expressed only during the S phase of the cell cycle. We previously sequenced an R2 cDNA clone from the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. We found the message was upregulated by blood feeding. We now report the sequence of an R2 genomic clone. The gene consists of 4 introns and 5 exons. Both major and minor transcriptional start sites have been identified, and their use differs in sugar-fed versus blood-fed females. The gene contains putative cis-regulatory sites for E2F, Caudal (Cdx) and Dearolf (Dfd). The mosquito R2 gene contains iron-specific regulatory elements immediately upstream of the minimal promoter region. Binding of a factor to the distal putative Cdx site in the -400 region is altered by iron treatment of cells.

Knowledge of potentially fatal complications of yellow fever vaccine should temper decisions to vaccinate populations where the disease is not endemic.",M2
20156972,"Dynamic T cell migration program provides resident memory within intestinal epithelium.Migration to intestinal mucosa putatively depends on local activation because gastrointestinal lymphoid tissue induces expression of intestinal homing molecules, whereas skin-draining lymph nodes do not. This paradigm is difficult to reconcile with reports of intestinal T cell responses after alternative routes of immunization. We reconcile this discrepancy by demonstrating that activation within spleen results in intermediate induction of homing potential to the intestinal mucosa. We further demonstrate that memory T cells within small intestine epithelium do not routinely recirculate with memory T cells in other tissues, and we provide evidence that homing is similarly dynamic in humans after subcutaneous live <e>yellow fever</e> vaccine immunization. These data explain why systemic immunization routes induce local cell-mediated immunity within the intestine and indicate that this tissue must be seeded with memory T cell precursors shortly after activation.",M2

METHODS: The primers were designed according to the published nucleotide sequences of YFV 17D strains in GenBank. Total RNA of was extracted by the Trizol and reverse transcripted. The each fragments of the YFV genome were amplified by PCR and sequenced subsequently. The fragments of the 5' and 3' end of the two strains were cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector and then sequenced. RESULTS: The nucleotide acid and amino acid sequences of the homology to both strains were 99% with each other. No obvious nulceotide changes were found in the sequences of the entire genome of each 17D strains. Moreover, there was no obvious changes in the E protein genes. But the E173 of YF17D Tiantan, associted with the virulence, had mutantions. And the two live attenuated yellow fever 17D vaccine strains fell to the same lineage by the phylogenetic analysis. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the two attenuated yellow fever 17D vaccine viruses accumulates mutations at a very low frequency and the genomes were relative stable.",M2

We extracted all cases of serious neurologic adverse events that occurred within 30 days of yellow fever vaccination in our institution during 2000-2008. Four cases (meningitis, n = 2 and meningo-encephalitis, n = 2) were identified. The male:female ratio was 3:1, and ages ranged from 21 to 55 years. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed pleocytosis (10-82 cells/mm(3), 64-84% lymphocytes), with slightly elevated protein levels (0.4-0.68 g/L). All symptoms resolved in three patients, but attention disorder and cerebellar syndrome persisted in one patient (at six months follow-up). The incidence of yellow fever vaccine-associated serious neurologic events was estimated to be 9.9/100,000 vaccine doses (95% confidence interval = 2.7-25.4/100,000) in this study, which was 10 times higher than previous estimates that did not include acute meningitis.",M2

However, to date, there is no reliable method for the induction of primary human T cell responses in the laboratory. Here, we optimized a culture strategy incorporating highly purified lymphocytes and dendritic cells, in the absence of any exogenous growth factors, for the in vitro sensitization of naïve CD4(+) T cells against a variety of protein antigens. This fully autologous approach, which was superior to the more traditional PBMC assay for supporting the induction of primary human T helper cell responses in culture, elicited effector cells capable of producing a variety of Th cytokines, including IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-2, IL-5, IL-17 and IL-21, and memory cells that could be restimulated multiple times with a specific antigen. Through simple modifications to this culture method, we evaluated the role of dendritic cell maturation state and regulatory T cells on the sensitization of naïve T helper cells, which highlights its utility for addressing basic questions of human immunobiology. Finally, using the formulated <e>yellow fever</e> vaccine, YF-VAX (R), we provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of the utility of the system for evaluating the T cell immunogenicity of vaccine candidates in a pre-clinical setting.",M2
19906894,"Clinical and immunological insights on severe, adverse neurotropic and viscerotropic disease following 17D <e>yellow fever</e> vaccination.Yellow fever (YF) vaccines (17D-204 and 17DD) are well tolerated and cause very low rates of severe adverse events (YEL-SAE), such as serious allergic reactions, neurotropic adverse diseases (YEL-AND), and viscerotropic diseases (YEL-AVD). Viral and host factors have been postulated to explain the basis of YEL-SAE. However, the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of YEL-SAE remain unknown. The present report provides a detailed immunological analysis of a 23-year-old female patient. The patient developed a suspected case of severe YEL-AVD with encephalitis, as well as with pancreatitis and myositis, following receipt of a 17D-204 YF vaccination. The patient exhibited a decreased level of expression of Fc-gammaR in monocytes (CD16, CD32, and CD64), along with increased levels of NK T cells (an increased CD3(+) CD16(+/-) CD56(+/-)/CD3(+) ratio), activated T cells (CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells), and B lymphocytes. Enhanced levels of plasmatic cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6], IL-17, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) as well as an exacerbated ex vivo intracytoplasmic cytokine pattern, mainly observed within NK cells (gamma interferon positive [IFN-gamma(+)], tumor necrosis factor alpha positive [TNF-alpha(+)], and IL-4 positive [IL-4(+)]), CD8(+) T cells (IL-4(+) and IL-5(+)), and B lymphocytes (TNF-alpha(+), IL-4(+), and IL-10(+)). The analysis of CD4(+) T cells revealed a complex profile that consisted of an increased frequency of IL-12(+) and IFN-gamma(+) cells and a decreased percentage of TNF-alpha(+), IL-4(+), and IL-5(+) cells. Depressed cytokine synthesis was observed in monocytes (TNF-alpha(+)) following the provision of antigenic stimuli in vitro. These results support the hypothesis that a strong adaptive response and abnormalities in the innate immune system may be involved in the establishment of YEL-AND and YEL-AVD.",M2

This impedes the development of novel vaccines to incurable diseases such as HIV and cancer. In this study, we have used functional genomics and polychromatic flow cytometry to define the signature of the immune response to the yellow fever (YF) vaccine 17D (YF17D) in a cohort of 40 volunteers followed for up to 1 yr after vaccination. We show that immunization with YF17D leads to an integrated immune response that includes several effector arms of innate immunity, including complement, the inflammasome, and interferons, as well as adaptive immunity as shown by an early T cell response followed by a brisk and variable B cell response. Development of these responses is preceded, as demonstrated in three independent vaccination trials and in a novel in vitro system of primary immune responses (modular immune in vitro construct [MIMIC] system), by the coordinated up-regulation of transcripts for specific transcription factors, including STAT1, IRF7, and ETS2, which are upstream of the different effector arms of the immune response. These results clearly show that the immune response to a strong vaccine is preceded by coordinated induction of master transcription factors that lead to the development of a broad, polyfunctional, and persistent immune response that integrates all effector cells of the immune system.",M2
19010368,"Does <e>yellow fever</e> 17D vaccine protect against melanoma?BCG vaccine, vaccinia vaccine and certain pathogens that were shown in previous studies to protect against melanoma have antigenic determinants homologous in their amino acids sequence with the melanoma antigen HERV-K-MEL, encoded by a human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K), which is expressed in about 95% of malignant melanocytes. Yellow fever vaccine (YFV) likewise contains an antigenic determinant with a close homology to HERV-K-MEL and might therefore also confer protection against melanoma. To investigate this possibility we carried out a cohort study (28,306 subjects) and a nested case-control study (37 melamona cases and 151 tumors not expressing HERV-K-MEL) in Veneto region (North-Eastern Italy). The standardized incidence ratio was 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 0.84-2.11), 1.59 (0.97-2.59) and 0.59 (0.19-1.84), while the age- gender-adjusted odds ratios were 1.00, 0.96 (0.43-2.14) and 0.26 (0.07-0.96), at 0-4, 5-9, and &gt; or =10 years elapsed from YFV administration, respectively.

Higher levels may be required for maintaining normal immune function. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between total body vitamin A stores in adult men and measures of adaptive immune function. We conducted an 8-wk residential study among 36 healthy Bangladeshi men with low vitamin A stores. Subjects received a standard diet and were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive vitamin A (240 mg) or placebo during wk 2 and 3. Subjects received Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) and tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccines during wk 5. Vitamin A stores were estimated by isotopic dilution during wk 8. Vaccine-specific lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production, and serum antibody responses were evaluated before and after vaccination. Vitamin A supplementation increased YFV- and TT-specific lymphocyte proliferation and YFV-specific interleukin (IL)-5, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production but inhibited development of a TT-specific IL-10 response. Both groups developed protective antibody responses to both vaccines. Some responses correlated positively with vitamin A stores. These findings indicate that the currently recommended vitamin A intake is sufficient to sustain a protective response to YFV and TT vaccination. However, YFV-specific lymphocyte proliferation, some cytokine responses, and neutralizing antibody were positively associated with liver vitamin A stores &gt; 0.084 micromol/g.

18715730,"[<e>Yellow fever</e> vaccination in non-immunocompetent patients]Any person travelling in countries where yellow fever (YF) is endemic and without presenting contra-indication for the vaccination against YF may be vaccinated. This vaccination can very rarely induce a potentially lethal neurotropic or viscerotropic disease. In severely immunodeficient patients, the vaccination is contra-indicated because postvaccinal encephalitis may occur after the vaccination, due to vaccine strain pathogenecity. It is important to evaluate the general health status in elderly individuals before vaccinating because of the increased risk of viscerotropic disease in people of 60 years of age and over. Pregnant women should not be vaccinated, except if departure to an endemic zone is unavoidable. YF vaccinatio is contra-indicated for newborns under six months of age. Solid organ grafts, congenital immunodeficiency, leukemia, lymphoma, cancer, and immunosuppressive treatments are contra-indications for this vaccination. Nevertheless, YF immunization is possible after a bone marrow graft and a two-year period without graft-versus-host disease or immunosuppressive treatment. There is no data to support that immunization of the dono prior to the graft could confer protection against yellow fever to the recipient. Low doses, short courses of corticosteroids either as systemic treatment or intra-articular injections are not contra-indications for YF vaccination. Patients infected with HIV with stable clinical status and T CD4-cel count above 200 cells per millimetre cube may be vaccinated. Thymic diseases, including thymoma and thymectomy, are contra-indications for YF vaccination. Finally, a substantial residual level of antibodies beyond 10 years after the latest vaccination could confer protection, thus avoiding a new vaccination when it is an issue.",M2

Despite its excellent safety record, some cases of viscerotropic adverse events develop, which are sometimes fatal. The mechanisms underlying such events remain a mystery. Here, we present an analysis of the immunologic and genetic factors driving disease in a 64-year-old male who developed viscerotropic symptoms. METHODS: We obtained clinical, serologic, virologic, immunologic and genetic data on this case patient. RESULTS: Viral RNA was detected in the blood 33 days after vaccination, in contrast to the expected clearance of virus by day 7 after vaccination in healthy vaccinees. Vaccination induced robust antigen-specific T and B cell responses, which suggested that persistent virus was not due to adaptive immunity of suboptimal magnitude. The genes encoding OAS1, OAS2, TLR3, and DC-SIGN, which mediate antiviral innate immunity, were wild type. However, there were heterozygous genetic polymorphisms in chemokine receptor CCR5, and its ligand RANTES, which influence the migration of effector T cells and CD14+CD16bright monocytes to tissues. Consistent with this, there was a 200-fold increase in the number of CD14+CD16bright monocytes in the blood during viremia and even several months after virus clearance. CONCLUSION: In this patient, viscerotropic disease was not due to the impaired magnitude of adaptive immunity but instead to anomalies in the innate immune system and a possible disruption of the CCR5-RANTES axis.",M2

We have used real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and virus titration by plaque assay to determine the replication of yellow fever 17DD virus (YFV 17DD) and recombinant yellow fever 17D viruses expressing envelope proteins of dengue virus serotypes 2 and 4 (17D-DENV-2 and 17D-DENV-4). Serum samples from rhesus monkeys inoculated with YFV 17DD and 17D-DENV chimeras by intracerebral or subcutaneous route were used to determine and compare the viremia induced by these viruses. Viral load quantification in samples from monkeys inoculated by either route with YFV 17DD virus suggested a restricted capability of the virus to replicate reaching not more than 2.0 log10 PFU mL(-1) or 3.29 log10 copies mL(-1). Recombinant 17D-dengue viruses were shown by plaquing and real-time PCR to be as attenuated as YF 17DD virus with the highest mean peak titer of 1.97 log10 PFU mL(-1) or 3.53 log10 copies mL(-1).

Our results show that both vaccines generated a brisk primary effector CD8(+) T cell response of substantial magnitude that could be readily quantitated with a simple set of four phenotypic markers. Secondly, the vaccine-induced T cell response was highly specific with minimal bystander effects. Thirdly, virus-specific CD8(+) T cells passed through an obligate effector phase, contracted more than 90% and gradually differentiated into long-lived memory cells. Finally, these memory cells were highly functional and underwent a memory differentiation program distinct from that described for human CD8(+) T cells specific for persistent viruses.

18400851,"E protein domain III determinants of <e>yellow fever</e> virus 17D vaccine strain enhance binding to glycosaminoglycans, impede virus spread, and attenuate virulence.The yellow fever virus (YFV) 17D strain is one of the most effective live vaccines for human use, but the in vivo mechanisms for virulence attenuation of the vaccine and the corresponding molecular determinants remain elusive. The vaccine differs phenotypically from wild-type YFV by the loss of viscerotropism, despite replicative fitness in cell culture, and genetically by 20 amino acid changes predominantly located in the envelope (E) protein. We show that three residues in E protein domain III inhibit spread of 17D in extraneural tissues and attenuate virulence in type I/II interferon-deficient mice. One of these residues (Arg380) is a dominant glycosaminoglycan-binding determinant, which mainly accounts for more rapid in vivo clearance of 17D from the bloodstream in comparison to 17D-derived variants with wild-type-like E protein. While other mutations will account for loss of neurotropism and phenotypic stability, the described impact of E protein domain III changes on virus dissemination and virulence is the first rational explanation for the safety of the 17D vaccine in humans.",M2

An overall correlation between the tests of 98.7% was established based on the analysis of 150 sera from individuals after vaccination with the 17D yellow fever vaccine. The sensitivity and specificity, calculated using the 150 sera from vaccinees and 150 sera from healthy blood donors, were 95% and 95%, respectively, for the IgG IFA and 94% and 97% for the IgM IFA. Antibody titers found in the PRNT correlated poorly with the IgM and IgG titers detected by IFA. The analysis of preexisting heterologous flaviviral immunity revealed the presence of antibodies reactive with YFV, tick-borne encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 in 20 out of the 150 vaccinees. The indirect IFA showed that nine of these individuals with previous flaviviral exposure who received 17D vaccine failed to produce detectable IgM antibodies. Despite this preexisting immunity, all vaccinees developed protective immunity as detected by PRNT and anti-YFV IgG antibodies as detected by IFA.

Histopathologic and immunohistochemical studies of tissues from these animals showed typical hepatic changes of severe yellow fever (inflammation, hepatocyte necrosis, and steatosis) without brain involvement. In contrast, 50% of immunosuppressed hamsters receiving the YFV-17D-attenuated vaccine developed a slowly progressive encephalitic-type illness. Brain tissue from these latter animals revealed focal neuronal changes, inflammation, and YFV antigen-positive neurons; however, the liver and spleen appeared normal. YFV was isolated from brain cultures of many of these animals. Immunocompetent (non-immunosuppressed) hamsters inoculated with both viruses developed a subclinical infection. Results of this study indicate that wild-type YFV is hepatotropic in immunosuppressed hamsters, whereas the attenuated YFV-17 is primarily neurotropic. These findings support current recommendations against yellow fever vaccination of immunosuppressed/immunocompromised people and suggest that this hamster model might be useful for monitoring the safety of other live-attenuated YFV vaccines.",M2

In this study we describe a detailed phenotypic investigation of major and minor peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations aimed at characterizing the kinetics of the adaptive immune response following primary 17DD vaccination. Our major finding is a decreased frequency of circulating CD19+ cells at day 7 followed by emerging activation/modulation phenotypic features (CD19+interleukin(IL)10R+/CD19+CD32+) at day 15. Increased frequency of CD4+human leucocyte antigen D-related(HLA-DR+) at day 7 and CD8+HLA-DR+ at day 30 suggest distinct kinetics of T cell activation, with CD4+ T cells being activated early and CD8+ T cells representing a later event following 17DD vaccination. Up-regulation of modulatory features on CD4+ and CD8+ cells at day 15 seems to be the key event leading to lower frequency of CD38+ T cells at day 30. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the co-existence of phenotypic features associated with activation events and modulatory pathways. Positive correlations between CD4+HLA-DR+ cells and CD4+CD25high regulatory T cells and the association between the type 0 chemokine receptor CCR2 and the activation status of CD4+ and CD8+ cells further support this hypothesis. We hypothesize that this controlled microenviroment seems to be the key to prevent the development of serious adverse events, and even deaths, associated with the 17DD vaccine reported in the literature.",M2

Angiographic tests were pathognomonic for MEWDS. Perimetry revealed left-eye blind spot enlargement. Initial inflammatory/infectious work-up was negative. Signs and symptoms resolved spontaneously within 6 weeks, with concomitant normalization of ancillary exams. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentation and the benign course were consistent with the diagnosis of MEWDS. No other aetiopathogenic factor than simultaneous HAV and YF immunization was identified, suggesting an autoimmune basis for MEWDS in predisposed patients.",M2
17038829,"Exercise-induced serum enzyme elevations confounding the evaluation of investigational drug toxicity. Report of two cases in a vaccine trial.Two subjects developed marked elevations in creatine kinase and other serum enzymes associated with mild myalgia during a randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 1 clinical trial of an investigational live, attenuated vaccine against West Nile virus (ChimeriVax-WN02). One subject had received ChimeriVax-WN02 while the other subject was enrolled in an active control group and received licensed <e>yellow fever</e> 17D vaccine (YF-VAX). Subsequently, the clinical trial was interrupted, and an investigation was begun to evaluate the enzyme abnormalities. As daily serum samples were collected for determination of quantitative viremia, it was possible to define the enzyme elevations with precision and to relate these elevations to physical activity of the subjects, symptoms, and virological and serological measurements. Evaluation of both subjects clearly showed that skeletal muscle injury, and not cardiac or hepatic dysfunction, was responsible for the biochemical abnormalities. This investigation also implicated strenuous exercise as the cause of the apparent muscle injury rather than the study vaccines. As a result of this experience, subjects engaged in future early-stage trials of these live, attenuated viral vaccines will be advised not to engage in contact sports or new or enhanced exercise regimens for which they are not trained or conditioned. The inclusion of placebo control arm (in lieu of or addition to an active vaccine control) will also be useful in differentiating causally related serum enzyme elevations.",M2

Forty-two healthy YF naïve adults randomly received a single dose of either ChimeriVax-DEN2 (high dose, 5 log plaque forming units [PFU] or low dose, 3 log PFU) or YF-VAX by the subcutaneous route (SC). To determine the effect of YF preimmunity on the ChimeriVax-DEN2 vaccine, 14 subjects previously vaccinated against YF received a high dose of ChimeriVax-DEN2 as an open-label vaccine. Most adverse events were similar to YF-VAX and of mild to moderate intensity, with no serious side-effects. One hundred percent and 92.3% of YF naïve subjects inoculated with 5.0 and 3.0 log10 PFU of ChimeriVax-DEN2, respectively, seroconverted to wt DEN2 (strain 16681); 92% of subjects inoculated with YF-VAX seroconverted to YF 17D virus but none of YF naïve subjects inoculated with ChimeriVax-DEN2 seroconverted to YF 17D virus. Low seroconversion rates to heterologous DEN serotypes 1, 3 and 4 were observed in YF naïve subjects inoculated with either ChimeriVax-DEN2 or YF-VAX. In contrast, 100% of YF immune subjects inoculated with ChimeriVax-DEN2 seroconverted to all 4 DEN serotypes. Surprisingly, levels of neutralizing antibodies to DEN 1, 2 and 3 viruses in YF immune subjects persisted after 1 year. These data demonstrated that (1) the safety and immunogenicity profile of the ChimeriVax-DEN2 vaccine is consistent with that of YF-VAX, and (2) preimmunity to YF virus does not interfere with ChimeriVax-DEN2 immunization, but induces a long lasting and cross neutralizing antibody response to all 4 DEN serotypes. The latter observation can have practical implications toward development of a dengue vaccine.",M2
17012867,"<e>Yellow fever</e> 17D vaccine safety and immunogenicity in the elderly.The incidence of serious and severe multisystem adverse events (AEs) following yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine is higher in persons of advanced age. One hypothesis for the occurrence of these AEs in the elderly is immunological senescence and a reduced ability to clear the vaccine virus infection. We determined age-specific rates of serious and nonserious AEs in two large clinical trials of two YF 17D vaccines from different manufacturers. In addition, we analyzed AEs reported in a large general practice data base in the United Kingdom. Neutralizing antibody responses were compared in young and elderly subjects. In the clinical trials, involving a total of 4,532 subjects, there were no neurological and viscerotropic AEs; interestingly, the incidence of common injection site and systemic AEs was significantly lower in elderly than in younger subjects. The neutralizing antibody categorical and quantitative responses were equivalent across younger and elderly subjects. In contrast, the larger retrospective analysis of 43,555 persons receiving YF 17D in the UK general practice database revealed a higher incidence of significant neurologic and multisystem AEs with advancing age. The age-specific reporting rate ratio (RRR) was approximately twice that in the 25-44 year-old reference group for subjects in the 45-64 year age group (RRR 1.82; 95% CI 0.88,3.77) and 3-fold higher for the 65-74 year-old age group (RRR 2.82; 95% CI 0.81, 9.81). These results are consistent with previous reports on YF vaccine safety in the US (Martin M, et al. Emerg Infect Dis 2001;6:945-51; Khromova et al., Vaccine 2005;23:3256-63). In elderly persons, YF 17D vaccine is associated with a higher frequency of significant AEs in the elderly but a lower incidence of common nonserious side-effects. The neutralizing antibody response, which is the mediator of protective immunity to YF, is not diminished in healthy, elderly persons.",M2

In this article, we review one of the possible approaches to enable this development, which is the insertion of foreign protein epitopes into different locations of the genome. We describe the three-dimensional (3D) modeling of the YF 17D virus E protein structure based on tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and the identification of a potential insertion site located at the YF 17D fg loop. Further 3D analysis revealed that it is possible to accommodate inserts of different sizes and amino acid composition in the flavivirus E protein fg loop. We demonstrate that seven YF 17D viruses bearing foreign epitopes that vary in sequence and length show differential growth characteristics in cell culture. The testing of recombinant viruses for mouse neurovirulence suggests that insertions at the 17D E protein fg loop do not compromise the attenuated phenotype of YF 17D virus, further confirming the potential use of this site for the development of new live attenuated 17D virus-based vaccines.",M2

16461338,"<e>Yellow fever</e> vaccine YF-17D activates multiple dendritic cell subsets via TLR2, 7, 8, and 9 to stimulate polyvalent immunity.The live attenuated yellow fever vaccine 17D (YF-17D) is one of the most effective vaccines available, with a 65-yr history of use in &gt;400 million people globally. Despite this efficacy, there is presently no information about the immunological mechanisms by which YF-17D acts. Here, we present data that suggest that YF-17D activates multiple Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on dendritic cells (DCs) to elicit a broad spectrum of innate and adaptive immune responses. Specifically, YF-17D activates multiple DC subsets via TLRs 2, 7, 8, and 9 to elicit the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-12p40, IL-6, and interferon-alpha. Interestingly, the resulting adaptive immune responses are characterized by a mixed T helper cell (Th)1/Th2 cytokine profile and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, distinct TLRs appear to differentially control the Th1/Th2 balance; thus, whilst MyD88-deficient mice show a profound impairment of Th1 cytokines, TLR2-deficient mice show greatly enhanced Th1 and Tc1 responses to YF-17D. Together, these data enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of action of YF-17D, and highlight the potential of vaccination strategies that use combinations of different TLR ligands to stimulate polyvalent immune responses.",M2

In the absence of other lots at the same passage level a large vaccine batch produced from 102/84 was turned into a new working seed. This new seed was characterized with regard to attenuation in the recommended internationally accepted monkey neurovirulence test (MNVT) using the 102/84 virus as reference. All rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) developed limited viremia and comparable neutralizing antibody titers. Clinical evaluation and histological examination of the central nervous system (CNS) according to WHO criteria for acceptability gave consistent data that demonstrated an attenuated phenotype for the YF 17DD 993FB013Z (13Z) vaccine batch. It is concluded that the additional chicken embryo passage did not lead to any genetic change and the new working seed virus retained its attenuation for monkeys comparable to the 102/84 reference virus.",M2
16260489,"Live attenuated <e>yellow fever</e> 17D infects human DCs and allows for presentation of endogenous and recombinant T cell epitopes.The yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine is one of the most successful live attenuated vaccines available. A single immunization induces both long-lasting neutralizing antibody and YF-specific T cell responses. Surprisingly, the mechanism for this robust immunity has not been addressed. In light of several recent reports suggesting flavivirus interaction with dendritic cells (DCs), we investigated the mechanism of YF17D interaction with DCs and the importance of this interaction in generating T cell immunity. Our results show that YF17D can infect immature and mature human DCs. Viral entry is Ca(2+) dependent, but it is independent of DC-SIGN as well as multiple integrins expressed on the DC surface. Similar to infection of cell lines, YF infection of immature DCs is cytopathic. Although infection itself does not induce DC maturation in vitro, TNF-alpha-induced maturation protects DCs from YF-induced cytopathogenicity. Furthermore, we show that DCs infected with YF17D or YF17D carrying a recombinant epitope can process and present antigens for CD8(+) T cell stimulation. These findings offer insight into the immunologic mechanisms associated with the highly capable YF17D vaccine that may guide effective vaccine design.",M2
16011430,"West Nile virus infection and serologic response among persons previously vaccinated against <e>yellow fever</e> and Japanese encephalitis viruses.It is hypothesized that previous heterologous flaviviral exposure may modulate clinical illness among persons infected with West Nile virus (WNV). Little is known about the serological response in such persons. In summer 2003, a WNV outbreak occurred in Colorado, the location of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases (DVBID). DVBID employees, most previously vaccinated with yellow fever virus (YFV) or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccines, were studied to determine whether previous vaccination affected symptom development among those subsequently infected with WNV during the outbreak, as well as their serological response. Serum samples collected in December 2003 and previously banked samples were tested using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) against WNV, Saint Louis encephalitis virus, dengue- 4 virus, JEV, and YFV. Specimens shown to have WNV antibody by PRNT were tested by IgM and IgG enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Ten (9%) of 113 serosurvey participants had WNV neutralizing antibody titers in December 2003. PRNT titers from previous specimens showed that one of the ten had seroconverted to WNV before 2003. Of the remaining nine participants, seven reported illness in the summer of 2003, two of which were unvaccinated and five previously vaccinated. In the December 2003 specimens, five persons previously unvaccinated or vaccinated only against YFV had a fourfold or greater neutralizing titer with WNV than with other flaviviruses, whereas no persons previously vaccinated against JEV or JEV and YFV showed a similar difference in neutralizing titers. Eight of nine persons infected in 2003 had negative or indeterminate WNV MAC-ELISA results in the December 2003 sample; the ninth person was vaccinated against YFV one month previously, and was also YFV positive by MAC-ELISA. We conclude that previous flaviviral vaccination does not markedly affect the development of WNV fever and that the IgM antibody response in patients without neuroinvasive WNV disease is transient.",M2
16004173,"Rare case of fatal <e>yellow fever</e> vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease.This report describes a case of yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) that occurred after vaccination in a 22-year-old female. Our patient presented with a clinical syndrome of fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting, which quickly progressed to multiorgan failure and ultimately death on hospital day 4. YEL-AVD is an extremely rare condition reported only a few times in the literature. The yellow fever vaccine is a known stimulus of systemic inflammation in the body. A mild subclinical viremia develops, which results in a persistent and robust T-helper-cell-dependent antibody response with long-lasting immune protection. The very rare patient may have an aberrant response to the 17D vaccine strain, causing the multiple organ system failure seen in YEL-AVD. Predisposing host factors that contribute to YEL-AVD are not yet known. Treatment for YEL-AVD is supportive.

15956601,"Attenuation of recombinant <e>yellow fever</e> 17D viruses expressing foreign protein epitopes at the surface.The yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine is a live attenuated virus. Three-dimensional (3D) homology modeling of the E protein structure from YF 17D virus and its comparison with that from tick-borne encephalitis virus revealed that it is possible to accommodate inserts of different sizes and amino acid compositions in the flavivirus E protein fg loop. This is consistent with the 3D structures of both the dimeric and trimeric forms in which the fg loop lies exposed to solvents. We demonstrate here that YF 17D viruses bearing foreign humoral (17D/8) and T-cell (17D/13) epitopes, which vary in sequence and length, displayed growth restriction. It is hypothesized that interference with the dimer-trimer transition and with the formation of a ring of such trimers in order to allow fusion compromises the capability of the E protein to induce fusion of viral and endosomal membranes, and a slower rate of fusion may delay the extent of virus production. This would account for the lower levels of replication in cultured cells and of viremia in monkeys, as well as for the more attenuated phenotype of the recombinant viruses in monkeys. Testing of both recombinant viruses (17D/8 and 17D/13) for monkey neurovirulence also suggests that insertion at the 17D E protein fg loop does not compromise the attenuated phenotype of YF 17D virus, further confirming the potential use of this site for the development of new live attenuated 17D virus-based vaccines.",M2
15939510,"The suitability of <e>yellow fever</e> and Japanese encephalitis vaccines for immunization against West Nile virus.Seven volunteers involved in flavivirus studies have been immunized with commercial Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever vaccines JE-VAX and YF-VAX. Strong homologous and cross-reactive with West Nile virus (WNV) antibody responses with titers 1:1600 to 1:51200 were found in all donors. All donors developed high levels of yellow fever virus (YFV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) neutralizing antibodies with titers 1:50 to 1:1600 and 1:20 to 1:640, respectively, and WNV neutralizing antibodies with titers 1:10 to 1:80. In contrast, predominantly YF-specific cell-mediated immunity was detected in all immunized donors. Responses to YFV were long lasting, but the anti-JEV humoral immunity was found to decrease with time. Cross-reactive anti-WNV responses were following the same trend dropping below detectable level at 4 years post-immunization and sharply coming back after booster immunization with the JE vaccine. Thus, immunization with the commercial flavivirus JE vaccine may be beneficial for individuals at high risk of exposure to WNV, such as personnel involved in WN research.",M2
15919103,"Antibody responses against wild-type <e>yellow fever</e> virus and the 17D vaccine strain: characterization with human monoclonal antibody fragments and neutralization escape variants.Human monoclonal antibody fragments neutralizing wild-type and vaccine strains of yellow fever (YF) virus (genotypes West Africa I + II, East/Central Africa, 17D-204-WHO) were generated by repertoire cloning from YF patients. Analysis of virus escape variants identified amino acid (aa) 71 in domain II of the envelope glycoprotein (E) as the most critical residue for neutralization, with aa 153-155 in domain I contributing to the epitope. These data confirm the previous mapping of YFV neutralizing epitopes using mouse monoclonal antibodies but suggest that a conformational epitope could be formed by amino acids from domains I and II opposing each other in the dimeric form of the E protein. While the sera of the YF patients showed up to 10-fold reduced neutralizing activity against the 17D escape variants, sera from 17D vaccinees retained their neutralizing titers. Mutations in this major neutralizing epitope of YFV thus do not seem to carry the risk of immune escape in persons immunized with the YFV-17D vaccine.",M2

Based on 722 adverse event reports after YEL submitted to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System in 1990-2002, we updated the estimates of the age-adjusted reporting rates of serious adverse events, YEL-AVD and YEL-AND. We found that the reporting rates of serious adverse events were significantly higher among vaccinees aged &gt; or =60 years than among those 19-29 years of age (reporting rate ratio = 5.9, 95% CI 1.6-22.2).

One of the major challenges facing delivery of human vaccines in underdeveloped countries is the need for multiple injections to achieve full efficacy. To examine 17D as a vector for microbial T cell epitopes, we inserted the H-2K(d)-restricted CTL epitope of the circumsporozoite protein (CS) of Plasmodium yoelii between 17D nonstructural proteins NS2B and NS3. The recombinant virus, 17D-Py, was replication competent and stable in vitro and in vivo. A single subcutaneous injection of 10(5) PFU diminished the parasite burden in the liver by approximately 70%. The high level of protection lasted between 4 and 8 wk after immunization, but a significant effect was documented even 24 wk afterwards. Thus, the immunogenicity of a foreign T cell epitope inserted into 17D mimics some of the remarkable properties of the human vaccine. Priming with 17D-Py followed by boosting with irradiated sporozoites conferred sterile immunity to 90% of the mice. This finding indicates that the immune response of vaccine-primed individuals living in endemic areas could be sustained and magnified by the bite of infected mosquitoes.",M2

15207960,"Live flavivirus vaccines: reasons for caution.CONTEXT: Dengue, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, <e>yellow fever</e>, and West Nile viruses cause substantial morbidity and mortality each year. Modern transportation and the relaxation of mosquito-control measures are largely responsible for the increase of disease caused by flaviviruses. Without effective antiviral drugs, vaccination offers the best chance of decreasing the incidence of these diseases, and live virus vaccines are the most promising and cost effective. However, flaviviruses can recombine, which raises the possibility of recombination between a vaccine strain and wild-type virus resulting in a new virus with potentially undesirable properties. STARTING POINT: Recently, Arunee Sabchareon and colleagues reported up to 90% seroconversion rates in a phase I trial of live-attenuated dengue-virus vaccines in children (Pediatr Infect Dis J 2004; 23: 99-109). Other live flavivirus vaccines have also been tested against dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses. Thus far, efficacy seems promising. WHERE NEXT: Safety issues with the live flavivirus vaccines need to be recognised and addressed. The theoretical possibility of untoward recombination events can never be entirely dismissed, but steps can be taken to minimise risk. The development of non-live flavivirus vaccines should be encouraged.",M2

Habitual levels of the acute phase proteins fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but the dynamic variation of plasma levels of acute phase proteins may be of importance as well. The aim of this study was to document the variation in response by fibrinogen, CRP and IL-6 levels to a mild inflammatory stimulus (yellow fever vaccination) in 25 healthy individuals. Plasma levels of fibrinogen, CRP and IL-6 were determined at baseline and 7 days after vaccination, and genetic polymorphisms in these genes were determined. After vaccination, fibrinogen levels had changed between -13 and +44% (P = 0.003), CRP levels between -88 and +672% (not significant), and IL-6 levels between -55 and +448% (not significant). Genetic variation partly explained the interindividual variation in response, as IL-6 -174G homozygotes showed a significantly stronger increase in CRP levels than IL-6 -174C allele carriers. In conclusion, this study suggests that a large interindividual variation exists in the acute phase response to yellow fever vaccination, indicating that individuals may be classified as hyper-responders or hypo-responders, and that genetic variation may influence the responsiveness of an individual.",M2

Recent studies of chick cell-derived measles and mumps vaccines show evidence of two types of retrovirus particles, the endogenous avian retrovirus (EAV) and the endogenous avian leukosis virus (ALV-E), which originate from the chicken embryonic fibroblast substrates. In this study, we investigated substrate-derived avian retrovirus contamination in YF vaccines currently produced by three manufacturers (YF-vax [Connaught Laboratories], Stamaril [Aventis], and YF-FIOCRUZ [FIOCRUZ-Bio-Manguinhos]). Testing for reverse transcriptase (RT) activity was not possible because of assay inhibition. However, Western blot analysis of virus pellets with anti-ALV RT antiserum detected three distinct RT proteins in all vaccines, indicating that more than one source is responsible for the RTs present in the vaccines. PCR analysis of both chicken substrate DNA and particle-associated RNA from the YF vaccines showed no evidence of the long terminal repeat sequences of exogenous ALV subgroups A to D in any of the vaccines. In contrast, both ALV-E and EAV particle-associated RNA were detected at equivalent titers in each vaccine by RT-PCR. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed 61,600, 348,000, and 1,665,000 ALV-E RNA copies per dose of Stamaril, YF-FIOCRUZ, and YF-vax vaccines, respectively. ev locus-specific PCR testing of the vaccine-associated chicken substrate DNA was positive both for the nondefective ev-12 locus in two vaccines and for the defective ev-1 locus in all three vaccines. Both intact and ev-1 pol sequences were also identified in the particle-associated RNA. To investigate the risks of transmission, serum samples from 43 YF vaccine recipients were studied. None of the samples were seropositive by an ALV-E-based Western blot assay or had detectable EAV or ALV-E RNA sequences by RT-PCR. YF vaccines produced by the three manufacturers all have particles containing EAV genomes and various levels of defective or nondefective ALV-E sequences. The absence of evidence of infection with ALV-E or EAV in 43 YF vaccine recipients suggests low risks for transmission of these viruses, further supporting the safety of these vaccines.",M2

ACIP reviewed the cases, recommended enhanced surveillance for adverse events, and updated the ACIP statement on YEL. This report summarizes the preliminary surveillance findings, including two new suspected cases of YEL-AVD and four suspected cases of YEL-associated neurotropic disease (YEL-AND) (previously called postvaccinal encephalitis). Although YEL remains essential for travelers to areas in which yellow fever (YF) is endemic (Figure), these findings underscore the need for continued enhanced surveillance and timely clinical assessment of YEL-associated disease.",M2
12391677,"[Antibody responses in Japanese volunteers after immunization with <e>yellow fever</e> vaccine]To monitor the development of specific and cross-reactive antibody response in twenty Japanese volunteers after vaccination with live yellow fever vaccine. Serum samples were collected on various days after vaccination and examined for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies against yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DV), neutralizing antibodies against YFV and JEV, and IgM antibodies against YFV. None of the volunteers had been previously immunized with this vaccine. Fifteen of 20 had pre-vaccinated with JEV 7 to 40 years before. Ten of the 20 had neutralizing antibodies against JEV before immunization. None of the 20 had detectable antibodies against YFV or DV before vaccination. On day 10th after the vaccination, neutralizing antibodies to YFV were detected in 6 of 19 volunteers and IgM antibodies against YFV were detected in 7 of 19. On day 14th, HI, neutralizing, and IgM antibodies against YFV were detected in all the tested sera. Neutralizing antibodies against JEV were developed in 2 volunteers and HI antibodies against JEV were increased in 3 of 6 volunteers respectively. On day 29th, cross-reactive HI antibodies for JEV and DV were detected in all the tested sera. The results indicate that YF vaccine induces YFV-specific antibodies in all the tested volunteers and that it also induces HI antibodies cross-reactive for JEV and DV. The YF vaccine has a strong immunogenicity because it is a live vaccine, and induces antibody against YFV predominantly. The international certificate of yellow fever vaccination becomes valid 10 days after vaccination. On day 14th after vaccination, we detected neutralizing antibodies against YFV from all tested volunteers, however, only 6 of 19 volunteers had detectable neutralizing antibody on the 10th day after vaccination. Therefore, the vaccine may not be perfectly effective on day 10th after the vaccination.",M2
12365564,"Postvaccinal inflammatory neuropathy: peripheral nerve biopsy in 3 cases.Autoimmune inflammatory polyneuropathy (PN) can be triggered by vaccination. We report 3 such cases. A 36-year-old female nurse presented 15 days after a hepatitis B vaccination (HBV) with acute sensory disturbances in the lower limbs. She had severe ataxia but no weakness. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level was 84 mg/100 mL, with 3 lymphocytes. A 66-year-old man presented 21 days after HBV with severe motor and sensory PN involving all 4 limbs. A 66-year-old man presented 15 days after a <e>yellow fever</e> vaccination with progressive motor and sensory PN involving all 4 limbs and bilateral facial paralysis. CSF protein level was 300 mg/100 mL, with 5 lymphocytes. Six weeks later, a tracheostomy was performed. In these 3 patients, the nerve deficits lasted for months. In each case, peripheral nerve biopsy showed KP1-positive histiocytes but no T-lymphocytes in the endoneurium. On ultrastructural examination, there was axonal degeneration in the first 2 cases; in case 2, a few myelinated fibers exhibited an intra-axonal macrophage but the myelin sheath was preserved. There was only 1 example of macrophage-associated demyelination in case 2, but these were numerous in case 3. It is likely that in the first 2 cases, an autoimmune reaction against some axonal or neuronal components was triggered by HBV. It induced an acute sensory ataxic PN in case 1 and an acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) in case 2. The third patient had a chronic inflammatory demyelinating PN, likely triggered by yellow fever vaccination.",M2

All patients were clinically and laboratorially evaluated at days 5, 13 and 35 post vaccination. Frequency of side effects and clinical observations of this group of individuals were not different from the observed in recipients immunized with normal doses of the vaccine. At the second and third evaluation none of the subjects reported symptoms. None of the patients presented abnormalities at the physical examination at none of the time points and in all cases the blood examination was normal, except for a reduced number of platelets that was detected in one subject at the first and second evaluation and reverted to normal at third evaluation. At the first evaluation point, 8 subjects were serum negative and 6 serum positive for yellow fever at the plaque reduction neutralization test. In 5 subjects the observed titre was 10 times higher as the baseline of 2.36 Log10 mUI/ml. The samples collected at second and third evaluation (13th and 35th days) demonstrated that all subjects responded to the vaccination with the exception of one that did not present a positive result in any of the samples collected.

11853408,"Human cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to live attenuated 17D <e>yellow fever</e> vaccine: identification of HLA-B35-restricted CTL epitopes on nonstructural proteins NS1, NS2b, NS3, and the structural protein E.Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a re-emerging problem despite the existence of an effective live-attenuated vaccine. The induction of YFV-neutralizing antibodies undoubtedly contributes to vaccine efficacy, but T lymphocyte responses to YFV likely play a role in long-term efficacy. We studied the T lymphocyte responses to YFV in four vaccinees. Proliferation and cytolytic responses to YFV were demonstrated in all subjects. We isolated 13 YFV-specific CD8(+) CTL lines that recognized epitopes on the E, NS1, NS2b, and NS3 proteins; eight CTL lines were HLA-B35-restricted. YFV-specific T cell responses were detectable by IFN gamma ELISPOT assays 14 days postvaccination, with T cell frequencies sustained for up to 19 months. To our knowledge, this is the first report of human T lymphocyte responses following YFV vaccination. These results indicate that the live 17D YFV vaccine induced CD8(+) T cell responses directed against at least four different HLA-B35-restricted YFV epitopes.",M2

11803060,"Clinical proof of principle for ChimeriVax: recombinant live, attenuated vaccines against flavivirus infections.ChimeriVax is a live, attenuated recombinant virus constructed from <e>yellow fever</e> (YF) 17D in which the envelope protein genes of YF 17D are replaced with the corresponding genes of another flavivirus. A ChimeriVax vaccine was developed against Japanese encephalitis (JE). A randomized, double-blind, outpatient study was conducted to compare the safety and immunogenicity of ChimeriVax-JE and YF 17D. Six YF immune and six non-immune adults were randomized to receive a single SC inoculation of ChimeriVax-JE (5log(10)PFU), ChimeriVax-JE (4log(10)PFU) or YF-VAX((R)) (5log(10)PFU). Mild, transient injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms were noted in all treatment groups, with no significant difference between the groups. Nearly all subjects inoculated with ChimeriVax-JE at both dose levels developed a transient, low-level viremia which was similar in magnitude and duration to that following YF-VAX). Neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates to ChimeriVax-JE was 100% in the high and low dose groups in both naïve and YF immune subjects; seroconversion to wild-type JE strains was similar or lower than to the homologous (vaccine) virus. Mean neutralizing antibody responses were higher in the ChimeriVax-JE high dose groups (naïve subjects LNI 1.55, PRNT(50) 254; YF immune subjects LNI 2.23, PRNT(50) 327) than in the low dose groups (naïve subjects 1.38, PRNT(50) 128; YF immune subjects LNI 1.62, PRNT(50) 270). JE antibody levels were higher in YF immune than in naïve subjects, dispelling concerns about anti-vector immunity. The safety and immunogenicity profile of ChimeriVax-JE vaccine appears to be similar to that of YF 17D. The new vaccine holds promise for prevention of JE in travelers and residents of endemic countries. The ChimeriVax technology platform is being exploited for development of new vaccines against dengue and West Nile.",M2
11803058,"Heterogeneous nature of the genome of the ARILVAX <e>yellow fever</e> 17D vaccine revealed by consensus sequencing.Consensus sequencing of the genome of the ARILVAX live attenuated yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine was performed directly on reconstituted virus from a vial of the vaccine secondary seed (without plaque-purification or cloning of cDNA). The genome of ARILVAX was identical in organization and size (10,862 nucleotides (nt)) to other published YF 17D sequences. A total of 12 nt heterogeneities were detected indicating that the vaccine is a heterogeneous population. Some of these indicated the presence of quasispecies with residues not reported previously for other sequenced YF 17D strains. A number of nts clearly differed from some YF vaccine strain sequences but coincided with the others, which could be due to the use of consensus sequencing approach in this study. Most (but not all) of the heterogeneities and nt differences were silent (i.e. did not result in an amino acid change). The differences are inconsequential to safety and effectiveness of ARILVAX. Other YF 17D vaccines are undoubtedly also heterogeneous and need to be re-examined using the consensus approach.",M2
11797767,"Prospects for development of a vaccine against the West Nile virus.Vaccination provides the ultimate measure for personal protection against West Nile disease. The development of a West Nile vaccine for humans is justified by the uncertainty surrounding the size and frequency of future epidemics. At least two companies (Acambis Inc. and Baxter/immuno) have initiated research and development on human vaccines. West Nile encephalitis has also emerged as a significant problem for the equine industry. One major veterinary vaccine manufacturer (Ft. Dodge) is developing formalin-inactivated and naked DNA vaccines. The advantages and disadvantages of formalin-inactivated whole virion vaccines, Japanese encephalitis vaccine for cross-protection, naked DNA, and live attenuated vaccines are described. A novel technology platform for live, attenuated recombinant vaccines (ChimeriVax) represents a promising approach for rapid development of a West Nile vaccine. This technology uses <e>yellow fever</e> 17D as a live vector for envelope genes of the West Nile virus. Infectious clone technology is used to replace the genes encoding the prM and E structural proteins of yellow fever 17D vaccine virus with the corresponding genes of West Nile virus. The resulting virion has the protein coat of West Nile, containing all antigenic determinants for neutralization and one or more epitopes for cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The genes encoding the nucleocapsid protein, nonstructural proteins, and untranslated terminal regions responsible for replication remain those of the original yellow fever 17D virus. The chimeric virus replicates in the host like yellow fever 17D but immunizes specifically against West Nile virus.",M2

Because the cases were unusual and adverse events following YF vaccination had not been studied, we estimated age-related reporting rates for systemic illness following YF vaccination. We found that the rate of reported adverse events among elderly vaccinees was higher than among vaccinees 25 to 44 years of age. We also found two additional deaths among elderly YF vaccinees. These data signal a potential problem but are not sufficient to reliably estimate incidence rates or to understand potential underlying mechanisms; therefore, enhanced surveillance is needed. YF remains an important cause of severe illness and death, and travel to disease-endemic regions is increasing. For elderly travelers, the risk for severe illness and death due to YF infection should be balanced against the risk for systemic illness due to YF vaccine.",M2

METHODS: Four hundred and twenty infants who had completed BCG, OPV and DPT immunizations were randomized to receive yellow fever immunization at either 6 or 9 months. A single dose of 0.5 ml of the reconstituted vaccine was administered to each infant by subcutaneous injection. To determine the yellow fever antibody levels of the infants, each donated 1 ml whole blood prior to immunization and 3 months post-immunization. Each serum sample was titred on Vero cells against the vaccine virus. FINDINGS: The most common adverse reactions reported were fever, cough, diarrhoea and mild reactions at the inoculation site. The incidences of adverse reactions were not statistically different in both groups. None of the pre-immunization sera in both age groups had detectable yellow fever antibodies. Infants immunized at 6 months recorded seroconversion of 98.6% and those immunized at 9 months recorded 98% seroconversion. The GMT of their antibodies were 158.5 and 129.8, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that seroresponses to yellow fever immunization at 6 and 9 months as determined by seroconversion and GMTs of antibodies are similar. The findings of good seroresponses at 6 months without significant adverse effects would suggest that the 17D yellow fever vaccine could be recommended for use in children at 6 months in outbreak situations or in high risk endemic areas.",M2

In relation to the number of vaccinations per year, the incidence of severe complications is extremely low. PATIENT: Two weeks after vaccinations against hepatitis A, hepatitis B and yellow fever in preparation for a trip to Africa a 21-year-old woman experienced an acute and irreversible loss of vision to 0,05 and nasal visual field defect in the left eye. Whereas vision acuity did not recover the scotoma disappeared within 6 weeks. Cerebrospinal fluid showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis. Oligoglonale bands were absent. Pathological parameters were not presented in the serum. The MRI showed a hyperintense thickening of optic nerve,as well as a hyperintense focus in right temporal side using the T(2)W-Sequence. CONCLUSION: Only few cases have been reported with neurological complications, such as encephalitis, following vaccinations each of the above mentioned. As no other causes for the inflammation were found, the optic nerve involvement must have been caused by the vaccination. Which of the three vaccinations caused encephalitis can not be classified.",M2
11588700,"Travel vaccines and elderly persons: review of vaccines available in the United States.Aging is associated with alterations in immune responses and may lead to clinically significant changes in the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of certain vaccines. This review summarizes published data regarding the effects of age on responses after immunization with vaccines generally administered before travel. The specific vaccines discussed in detail include hepatitis A, typhoid, <e>yellow fever</e>, Japanese encephalitis, and rabies vaccines. There is some evidence of diminished serological responses to hepatitis A and rabies vaccines in older individuals. In addition, increased toxic effects following yellow fever vaccination in elderly recipients have recently been reported.

Consideration of potential age-related differences in responses to travel vaccines is becoming increasingly important as elderly persons more frequently venture to exotic destinations.",M2
11562714,"The early use of <e>yellow fever</e> virus strain 17D for vaccine production in Brazil--a review.The use of yellow fever (YF) virus 17D strain for vaccine production adapted in Brazil since its introduction in 1937 was reviewed. This was possible due to the availability of official records of vaccine production. The retrieved data highlight the simultaneous use of several serially passaged 17D substrain viruses for both inocula and vaccine preparation that allowed uninterrupted production. Substitution of these substrain viruses became possible with the experience gained during quality control and human vaccination. Post-vaccinal complications in humans and the failure of some viruses in quality control tests (neurovirulence for monkeys) indicated that variables needed to be reduced during vaccine production, leading to the development of the seed lot system. The 17DD substrain, still used today, was the most frequently used substrain and the most reliable in terms of safety and efficacy. For this reason, it is possible to derive an infectious cDNA clone of this substrain combined with production in cell culture that could be used to direct the expression of heterologous antigens and lead to the development of new live vaccines.",M2

A similar case occurred in 1996. All four patients were more than 63 years old. METHODS: Vaccine strains of yellow fever virus, isolated from the plasma of two patients and the cerebrospinal fluid of one, were characterised by genomic sequencing. Clinical samples were subjected to neutralisation assays, and an immunohistochemical analysis was done on one sample of liver obtained at biopsy. FINDINGS: The clinical presentations were characterised by fever, myalgia, headache, and confusion, followed by severe multisystemic illnesses. Three patients died. Vaccine-related variants of yellow fever virus were found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of one vaccinee. The convalescent serum samples of two vaccinees showed antibody responses of at least 1:10240. Immunohistochemical assay of liver tissue showed yellow fever antigen in the Kuppfer cells of the liver sample. INTERPRETATION: The clinical features, their temporal association with vaccination, recovery of vaccine-related virus, antibody responses, and immunohistochemical assay collectively suggest a possible causal relation between the illnesses and yellow fever vaccination. Yellow fever remains an important cause of illness and death in South America and Africa; hence, vaccination should be maintained until the frequency of these events is quantified.",M2
11441696,"[Vaccinations for overseas travelers--new evidence and recommendations]Vaccinations are an easy and highly effective way to keep travellers healthy. There are few problems with compliance, as all vaccinations are administered pretravel and many vaccines offer protection rates &gt; 95% after a single dose (e.g. hepatitis A, <e>yellow fever</e>). Vaccination of hepatitis A and diphtheriatetanus are recommended for all developing countries. Polio is still indicated for Asia and Africa. Hepatitis B, if possible in combination with A, is recommended for persons travelling for &gt; 30 days, travellers &lt; 35 years, and for people showing special risk behaviour (e.g. high-risk sports, unprotected sexual intercourse). Depending on destination and kind and duration of travel, further vaccinations have to be considered, e.g.: yellow fever (endemic areas, rule of entry), rabies (trekking, travel in remote areas), typhoid fever (Indian sub-continent), meningococcal meningitis (meningitis belt, pilgrims to Saudi-Arabia), tick-borne encephalitis (endemic areas in Europe and Asia), influenza (persons at special risk of complications), Japanese encephalitis (low standard travel in rural areas of Southeast Asia &gt; 30 days), measles (particularly endemic in Africa).

11301818,"Travel-related vaccines.Travelers are at increased risk for several infections, including familiar infections such as measles that are widely distributed but more common in developing countries. Vaccines can markedly decrease the risk for many of these infections and are an important part of pretravel preparation. Travel provides an opportunity to review and update routine vaccines in adults and assess risk from unusual infections. Global travel is growing. Persons who are elderly, HIV-infected, and immunocompromised account for many of the travelers. Studies that assess the immunogenicity, efficacy, and adverse effects of some of the special vaccines used primarily in travelers generally have been done in young, healthy populations. Findings in young adults do not apply to other populations in whom immune response can be slower, less effective, and less durable. Recent reports of severe adverse events in elderly persons who have received <e>yellow fever</e> vaccine are a reminder that widely used, old vaccines can have unexpected side effects when used in a new population. It is biologically plausible that adverse effects might be more common in the elderly, and epidemiologically plausible that occasional instances of similar adverse events in the past could have been missed. Studies on special and travel vaccines in the elderly are needed urgently to define how these vaccines should be used in older populations and whether alternative means for protection are needed.",M2
11463409,"Serious adverse events associated with <e>yellow fever</e> 17DD vaccine in Brazil: a report of two cases.BACKGROUND: The yellow fever vaccine is regarded as one of the safest attenuated virus vaccines, with few side-effects or adverse events. We report the occurrence of two fatal cases of haemorrhagic fever associated with yellow fever 17DD substrain vaccine in Brazil. METHODS: We obtained epidemiological, serological, virological, pathological, immunocytochemical, and molecular biological data on the two cases to determine the cause of the illnesses. FINDINGS: The first case, in a 5-year-old white girl, was characterised by sudden onset of fever accompanied by headache, malaise, and vomiting 3 days after receiving yellow fever and measles-mumps-rubella vaccines. Afterwards she decompensated with icterus and haemorrhagic signs and died after a 5-day illness. The second patient-a 22-year-old black woman-developed a sore throat and fever accompanied by headache, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting 4 days after yellow fever vaccination. She then developed icterus, renal failure, and haemorrhagic diathesis, and died after 6 days of illness. Yellow fever virus was recovered in suckling mice and C6/36 cells from blood in both cases, as well as from fragments of liver, spleen, skin, and heart from the first case and from these and other viscera fragments in case 2. RNA of yellow fever virus was identical to that previously described for 17D genomic sequences. IgM ELISA tests for yellow fever virus were negative in case 1 and positive in case 2; similar tests for dengue, hantaviruses, arenaviruses, Leptospira, and hepatitis viruses A-D were negative. Tissue injuries from both patients were typical of wild-type yellow fever. INTERPRETATION: These serious and hitherto unknown complications of yellow fever vaccination are extremely rare, but the safety of yellow fever 17DD vaccine needs to be reviewed. Host factors, probably idiosyncratic reactions, might have had a substantial contributed to the unexpected outcome.",M2
