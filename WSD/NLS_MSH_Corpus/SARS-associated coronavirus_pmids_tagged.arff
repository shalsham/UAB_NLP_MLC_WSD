16830001,"Radiographic features of SARS in paediatric patients: a review of cases in Singapore.INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged atypical pneumonia caused by the <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV). Chest radiographic appearances have been reported as non-specific, ranging from normal to peribronchial thickening and ill-defined airspace shadowing. This study is a retrospective review of chest radiographic findings in children with suspected and probable SARS during the 2003 outbreak in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We focused on children admitted to the SARS treatment ward from March 2003 to May 2003. Chest radiographs of children admitted with suspected or probable SARS as well as other febrile illness during this period were retrospectively and independently reviewed by 3 radiologists. The radiographs were randomised and anonymised before interpretation. Subsequently, we identified the radiographs of patients who were categorised as suspected or probable SARS. We present our findings in these patients' radiographs. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients' serial chest radiographs were interpreted. Of these, we subsequently selected those patients with suspected or probable SARS for analysis. The radiographic abnormalities in suspected or probable SARS patients consisted of patchy ground glass opacities or patchy airspace consolidation. The abnormalities had a predominantly lower zone distribution on chest radiographs, followed by mid-zone involvement. There was a slight preponderance of peripheral zone involvement. There was equal distribution of abnormalities in both lungs. All the children with radiographic abnormalities made uneventful recoveries and had normal radiographs on follow-up review. CONCLUSIONS: In children, SARS appears to have a relatively mild and nonspecific pattern of respiratory illness. The radiographic features in children with suspected or probable SARS in our study were comparable to other clusters of paediatric patients during initial presentation. It is difficult to distinguish SARS in children from other viral pneumonias on radiographic features alone. Positive travel history to endemic regions or positive contact history, and laboratory findings of lymphopaenia, leukopaenia and thrombocytopaenia are important clues.",M1
16824203,"Association of SARS susceptibility with single nucleic acid polymorphisms of OAS1 and MxA genes: a case-control study.BACKGROUND: Host genetic factors may play a role in susceptibility and resistance to <e>SARS associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) infection. The study was carried out to investigate the association between the genetic polymorphisms of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) gene as well as myxovirus resistance 1 (MxA) gene and susceptibility to SARS in Chinese Han population. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted. A collective of 66 SARS cases and 64 close contact uninfected controls were enrolled in this study. End point real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-based Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis were used to detect the single nucleic polymorphisms (SNPs) in OAS1 and MxA genes. Information on other factors associated with SARS infection was collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted. RESULTS: One polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the OAS1 gene was associated with SARS infection. Compared to AA genotype, AG and GG genotypes were found associated with a protective effect on SARS infection with ORs (95% CI) of 0.42 (0.20-0.89) and 0.30 (0.09-0.97), respectively. Also, a GT genotype at position 88 in the MxA gene promoter was associated with increased susceptibility to SARS infection compared to a GG genotype (OR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.25-7.50). The associations of AG genotype in OAS1 and GT genotype in MxA remained significant in multivariate analyses after adjusting for SARS protective measures (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.14-0.98 and OR = 3.22, 95% CI: 1.13-9.18, respectively). CONCLUSION: SNPs in the OAS1 3'-UTR and MxA promoter region appear associated with host susceptibility to SARS in Chinese Han population.",M1
16682481,"Production of an anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus human monoclonal antibody Fab fragment by using a combinatorial immunoglobulin gene library derived from patients who recovered from SARS.A combinatorial human immunoglobulin gene library was constructed from the peripheral lymphocytes of two patients who recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The library was screened for the production of Fab antibody fragments to a recombinant spike protein of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV). One Fab clone, AS3-3, reacted with the spike protein in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The dissociation constant of AS3-3 was 1.98 x 10(-8) M. Immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that it reacted with SARS-CoV-infected cells. The library seems to be a potent tool for the production of human antibodies to SARS-CoV.",M1
16470161,"The widening scope of coronaviruses.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the past 2 years, at least three distinct human coronaviruses have been discovered, including the etiological agent associated with severe acquired respiratory syndrome (SARS). These recently discovered viruses, with the exception of the <e>SARS associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV), are likely to be common respiratory viruses and may be responsible for a substantial proportion of respiratory tract disease. RECENT FINDINGS: The SARS-CoV first appeared in 2002 and spread rapidly around the globe. Although the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV may have been halted, the emergence of this new virus demonstrates the potential threat represented by species-to-species transmission of coronaviruses. NL63, initially isolated from a young child with lower respiratory tract disease, represents a group of newly described group I coronaviruses that have been identified worldwide, which are associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease, particularly in young children. The distribution of HKU1, a newly identified group II coronavirus, is not yet established. NL63 and HKU1 are related to the common human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, respectively. SUMMARY: The discovery of at least three new human coronaviruses represents significant advances in the investigation of human respiratory tract disease. Further studies are required to fully define the impact of these new pathogens.",M1
16060914,"Hypocortisolism in survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).OBJECTIVE: Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, many survivors were observed to suffer from psychosomatic symptoms reminiscent of various endocrine disorders. Hence, we sought to determine the existence of any chronic endocrine sequelae in SARS survivors. DESIGN, PATIENTS, MEASUREMENTS: Sixty-one survivors of SARS prospectively recruited were analysed for hormonal derangements 3 months following recovery. Patients with pre-existing endocrine disorders were excluded. Any endocrine abnormalities diagnosed were investigated and treated where indicated up to a year. Serial evaluation facilitated characterization of trends and prognostication of any endocrinological aberrations. RESULTS: Twenty-four (39.3%) patients had evidence of hypocortisolism. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction of the majority resolved within a year. Two (3.3%) of the hypocortisolic cohort had transient subclinical thyrotoxicosis. Four (6.7%) were biochemically hypothyroid, being comprised of three with central hypothyroidism and one with primary hypothyroidism. Two of the three with central hypothyroidism had concomitant central hypocortisolism. Eight had subnormal DHEAS levels. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings highlight a possible aetiologic role of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> in causing a reversible hypophysitis or direct hypothalamic effect, with the HPA axis affected more frequently than the HPT axis.",M1
16025480,"Novel rapid immunochromatographic test based on an enzyme immunoassay for detecting nucleocapsid antigen in <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e>.A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been discovered. The detection of both antigens and antibodies in SARS-CoV from human specimens with suspected SARS plays an important role in preventing infection. We developed a novel rapid immunochromatographic test (RICT) based on the sandwich format enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with an all-in-one device for detecting the native nucleocapsid antigen (N-Ag) of SARS-CoV using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), which we produced by immunizing recombinant N-Ag to mice. RICT is a qualitative assay for respiratory aspirates and serum specimens. With this assay, a positive result can be judged subjectively by the appearance of a blue line on the device 15 min after the sample is applied. RICT with several pairs of MoAbs showed a high sensitivity for the detection of recombinant N-Ag as well as viral N-Ag of SARS-CoV. rSN122 and rSN21-2 were the best MoAbs for immobilized antibody and enzyme labeling, respectively. With regard to analytical sensitivity, RICT detected N-Ag at 31 pg/mL for recombinant N-Ag, and at 1.99 x 10(2) TCID(50)/mL for SARS-CoV. The specificity of RICT was 100% when 150 human sera and 50 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NSPs) were used. RICT based on an EIA using the rSN122/rSN21-2 pair is a sensitive, specific, and reliable rapid assay for detecting N-Ag in SARS-CoV treated with either heat or Triton X-100.",M1
16012012,"Low prevalence of subclinical severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection among hospital healthcare workers in Hong Kong.We recruited 688 hospital healthcare workers who cared for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and did not develop the disease in the Hong Kong outbreak in 2003. A questionnaire survey was conducted and serum samples were collected for <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) antibody. The high-risk procedures performed and the types of unprotected exposures were recorded for analysis. Only 1 asymptomatic nurse had positive serological test. The result demonstrates the low rate of subclinical SARS-CoV infection in hospital healthcare workers and that the infection control practice against SARS in Hong Kong's hospitals during the outbreak was highly effective.",M1
15947329,"Follow-up study on pulmonary function and lung radiographic changes in rehabilitating severe acute respiratory syndrome patients after discharge.OBJECTIVES: To follow-up on the changes in lung function and lung radiographic pictures of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients discharged from Xiaotangshan Hospital in Beijing (by regularly receiving examination), and to analyze retrospectively the treatment strategy in these patients. METHODS: Surviving SARS patients were seen at least twice within 3 months after discharge and underwent <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) IgG antibody testing, pulmonary function testing, and chest radiography and/or high-resolution CT (HRCT) examinations at Chinese PLA General Hospital. The treatments received at Xiaotangshan Hospital were analyzed retrospectively and were correlated to later status. RESULTS: Positive SARS-Co virus IgG antibody results were seen in 208 of 258 patients, with 21.3% (55 of 258 patients) still having a pulmonary diffusion abnormality (D(LCO) &lt; 80% of predicted). By comparing the 155 survivors with positive SARS-CoV IgG antibody results and D(LCO) &gt; or = 80% predicted with the 50 patients with negative SARS-CoV IgG results, we found that 53 patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and a lung diffusion abnormality had endured a much longer course of fever and received larger doses of glucocorticoid, as well as higher ratios of oxygen inhalation and noninvasive ventilation treatment. For these patients, 51 of 53 patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and a lung diffusion abnormality underwent pulmonary function testing after approximately 1 month. D(LCO) improved in 80.4% of patients (41 of 51 patients). Of the patients with a lung diffusion abnormality, 40 of 51 patients showed lung fibrotic changes in the lung image examination and 22 patients (55%) showed improvement in lung fibrotic changes 1 month later. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that lung fibrotic changes caused by SARS disease occurred mostly in severely sick patients and may be self-rehabilitated. D(LCO) scores might be more sensitive than HRCT when evaluating lung fibrotic changes.",M1
15813661,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome: pertinent clinical characteristics and therapy.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infection that is caused by a previously unrecognized virus - a novel coronavirus designated as <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV). From November 2002 to July 2003 the cumulative number of worldwide cases was &gt;8000, with a mortality rate of close to 10%. The mortality has been higher in older patients and those with co-morbidities. SARS has been defined using clinical and epidemiological criteria and cases are considered laboratory-confirmed if SARS coronavirus is isolated, if antibody to SARS coronavirus is detected, or a polymerase chain reaction test by appropriate criteria is positive. At the time of writing (24 May 2004), no specific therapy has been recommended. A variety of treatments have been attempted, but there are no controlled data. Most patients have been treated throughout the illness with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, and other supportive measures. Transmission of SARS is facilitated by close contact with patients with symptomatic infection. The majority of cases have been reported among healthcare providers and family members of SARS patients. Since SARS-CoV is contagious, measures for prevention center on avoidance of exposure, and infection control strategies for suspected cases and contacts. This includes standard precautions (hand hygiene), contact precautions (gowns, goggles, gloves) and airborne precautions (negative pressure rooms and high efficiency masks). In light of reports of new cases identified during the winter of 2003-4 in China, it seems possible that SARS will be an important cause of pneumonia in the future, and the screening of outpatients at risk for SARS may become part of the pneumonia evaluation.",M1
15784184,"Th2 predominance and CD8+ memory T cell depletion in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.The immune spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is poorly understood. To define the dynamics of the immune spectrum in SARS, serum levels of cytokines, chemokines, immunoglobulins, complement and specific antibodies against <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and phenotypes of peripheral lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry in 95 SARS-infected patients. Results showed that interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) were continuously up-regulated during the entirety of SARS. Regulated on activation normally T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES) levels were decreased, while monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was elevated in acute patients. Immunoglobulins and complement were elevated during the first month of SARS. Both serum-positive rates and titers of specific IgM and IgG antibodies responding to SARS-CoV peaked at days 41-60 from the onset of SARS. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes decreased significantly in acute-phase. CD3+CD8+CD45RO+ T lymphocytes were decreased by 36.78% in the convalescent patients. Conclusion: SARS-CoV seemed to elicit effective humoral immunity but inhibited cellular immunity, especially CD8+ memory T lymphocytes over time. Prolonged overproduction of IL-10 and TGF-beta may play an important role in the disease.",M1
15636288,"Rapid creation of a temporary isolation ward for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in Taiwan.OBJECTIVES: To rapidly establish a temporary isolation ward to handle an unexpected sudden outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to evaluate the implementation of exposure control measures by healthcare workers (HCWs) for SARS patients. DESIGN: Rapid creation of 60 relatively negative pressure isolation rooms for 196 suspected SARS patients transferred from 19 hospitals and daily temperature recordings of 180 volunteer HCWs from 6 medical centers. SETTING: A military hospital. RESULTS: Of the 196 patients, 34 (17.3%) met the World Health Organization criteria for probable SARS with positive results of serologic testing for <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal or throat swabs for SARS-CoV, or both. Seventy-four patients had suspected SARS based on unprotected exposure to SARS patients; three of them had positive results on RT-PCR but negative serologic results. The remaining 88 patients did not meet the criteria for a probable or suspected SARS diagnosis. Of the 34 patients with probable SARS, 13 were transferred to medical centers to receive mechanical ventilation due to rapid deterioration of chest x-ray results, and three patients died of SARS despite intensive therapy in medical centers. During the study period, one nurse developed probable SARS due to violation of infection control measures, but there was no evidence of cross-transmission to other HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the use of full personal protection equipment, the facility failed to totally prevent exposures of HCWs to SARS but minimized the risk of nosocomial transmission. Better training and improvements in infection control infrastructure may limit the impact of SARS.",M1
15636287,"Foundations of the severe acute respiratory syndrome preparedness and response plan for healthcare facilities.OBJECTIVE: To help facilities prepare for potential future cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), assisted by members of professional societies representing public health, healthcare workers, and healthcare administrators, developed guidance to help facilities both prepare for and respond to cases of SARS. INTERVENTIONS: The recommendations in the CDC document were based on some of the important lessons learned in healthcare settings around the world during the SARS outbreak of 2003, including that (1) a SARS outbreak requires a coordinated and dynamic response by multiple groups; (2) unrecognized cases of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> are a significant source of transmission; (3) restricting access to the healthcare facility can minimize transmission; (4) airborne infection isolation is recommended, but facilities and equipment may not be available; and (5) staffing needs and support will pose a significant challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare facilities were at the center of the SARS outbreak of 2003 and played a key role in controlling the epidemic. Recommendations in the CDC's SARS preparedness and response guidance for healthcare facilities will help facilities prepare for possible future outbreaks of SARS.",M1
15535899,"[Effect of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> on peripheral blood picture and liver function]OBJECTIVE: To study peripheral blood picture and liver function of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and to accumulate more experience in prevention and treatment this syndrome. METHODS: The peripheral blood picture and liver function of 169 cases with SARS were analyzed. These patients were admitted to five hospitals in Taiyuan from March to May, 2003. RESULTS: Above 90.00% patients had normal or low white blood cell (WBC) count on the first day. From then on, during the second to third week, about 40.00% of the patients showed high WBC count average: (13.42+/-2.87)x10(9)/L at 15 th day and (13.68+/-3.26)x10(9)/L at 21 st day) and neutrophil (0.809+/-0.063 at 15 th day and 0.805+/-0.061 at 21 st day), and 21.97%-52.15% cases with low lymphocyte count (0.111+/-0.044-0.134+/-0.040). About 4.44%-12.76% of patients developed low platelet and 4.20%-33.33% of cases with low hemoglobin level. And 32.76%-62.50% of cases were found to have high alanine aminotransferase (above 40 U/L), 13.04%-40.00% cases with high aspartate aminotransferase (above 40 U/L) and 40.35%-72.00% cases with low albumin content. But serum total protein remained normal during the whole clinical course. CONCLUSION: SARS cases may develop leucocytosis, low lymphocyte count, low platelet count, low hemoglobin level and abnormal liver function.",M1
15531251,"Clinical picture, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in children.Children are susceptible to infection by <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) but the clinical picture of SARS is milder than in adults. Teenagers resemble adults in presentation and disease progression and may develop severe illness requiring intensive care and assisted ventilation. Fever, malaise, cough, coryza, chills or rigor, sputum production, headache, myalgia, leucopaenia, lymphopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, mildly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels are common presenting features. Radiographic findings are non-specific but high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax in clinically suspected cases may be an early diagnostic aid when initial chest radiographs appear normal. The improved reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are critical in the early diagnosis of SARS, with sensitivity approaching 80% in the first 3 days of illness when performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates, the preferred specimens. Absence of seroconversion to SARS-CoV beyond 28 days from disease onset generally excludes the diagnosis. The best treatment strategy for SARS among children remains to be determined. No case fatality has been reported in children and the short- to medium-term outcome appears to be good. The importance of continued monitoring for any long-term complications due to the disease or its empiric treatment, cannot be overemphasised.",M1
15523245,"[Human metapneumovirus pneumonia in an adult patient hospitalized for suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)]INTRODUCTION: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly identified virus responsible for occasionally severe respiratory infections, mainly observed in children. OBSERVATION: A 59-year old man was hospitalised for respiratory problems and fever 3 days after his return from China during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Other than fever (&gt;38 degrees C), the patient exhibited a dry cough, myalgias, arthralgias and mild lymphopenia and the chest radiography showed an opacity on the right lower lung. Conventional virological investigations remained negative. Detection of the novel <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> was negative but hMPV detection was positive. DISCUSSION: The present observation indicates that hMPV may cause respiratory symptoms mimicking initial manifestations of SARS in adults visiting epidemic countries. CONCLUSION: hMPV testing has clinical utility in adult patients with acute respiratory tract infection.",M1
15490031,"Clinicopathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome: an autopsy case report.In mid-April 2003, a major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) developed in Taiwan. During the outbreak, <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) was documented in 346 patients and 73 of them died. Autopsy was performed in 9 of the suspected SARS patients who died during the outbreak, but SARS was the cause of death in only 1 of these patients. Here we report the histological features of this patient and their clinicopathological correlations. The patient, a 36-year-old Indonesian woman, was a caretaker working for a Taiwanese family. She stayed in Taipei Jen-Chi Hospital from April 10 to April 19 to take care of her elderly employer. She developed fever on April 21 and respiratory distress on April 25, and received ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin, and steroid. The respiratory distress persisted and worsened, and intubation was performed on April 27. The respiratory condition improved initially after mechanical ventilation, but subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum developed on May 1. Her condition deteriorated rapidly and she died on May 2, 11 days after the onset of fever. Autopsy was performed on the same day. Histologically, the lungs showed severe diffuse alveolar damage and bronchopneumonia, but no viral inclusion. The spleen and lymph nodes revealed lymphoid depletion and the liver showed microvesicular steatosis. No specific pathological change was seen in the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. SARS-CoV genome was detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirate and the autopsy lung specimen.",M1
15347538,"Emergency medical services utilization during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the incidence of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> infection among emergency medical technicians.OBJECTIVES: This was a study to evaluate the utilization of emergency medical services (EMS) systems during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and to assess the incidence of infection among emergency medical technicians (EMTs). METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study conducted in the EMS system of Taipei, Taiwan. Probable/suspect cases of SARS were defined by World Health Organization criteria. SARS-related transports were categorized into 1) requests from hospitals for probable/suspect cases of SARS, 2) quarantined individuals, and 3) febrile persons. City ambulances were organized into teams A, B, and C for transports of different perceived risks. Data on the EMS volume, the transport category, the final SARS status of patients, and the EMT responsible for the transports were collected. The EMS projected volume was computed by previous years' data and compared with that collected. The SARS incidence among EMTs was assessed by investigating probable SARS (P-SARS) and by surveying the seroprevalence of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) antibody. RESULTS: From March 18 to June 19, 2003, there were 7,961 EMS transports, similar to the volume projected from previous years (7,506) (95% CI = 6,688 to 8,324). Of these, 1,760 (22.1%) were SARS-related. When SARS-related transports were excluded, there was a 12.2% decrease (95% CI = 11.4% to 12.9%) in EMS activities. Requests from hospitals, quarantined individuals, and febrile citizens accounted for 23%, 18%, and 59% of SARS-related transports. Among the 397 P-SARS cases in the city of 2.65 million people (incidence 0.01%, 95% CI = 0.01% to 0.02%), 138 (35%) required EMS transports. Two EMTs working in team C, the team with the lowest risk, developed P-SARS. One of them died soon thereafter. The incidence of P-SARS was 0.6% (95% CI = 0.2% to 2.2%), or 0.1% (95% CI = 0.03% to 0.4%) per transport. SARS-CoV serology was available in 74.1% of EMTs who were alive. In addition to the surviving P-SARS EMT, one EMT from team A, the team with the highest risk, was seropositive. Combining P-SARS and the seropositive case, three EMTs were infected (incidence 1.3%, 95% CI = 0.4% to 3.6%). No patient transported by the infected EMTs developed SARS. The hospitals serving EMS by the infected EMTs had been involved in a clustered outbreak prior to the EMTs' infections. CONCLUSIONS: During the outbreak of SARS, the overall EMS volume did not change significantly, but the non-SARS EMS activities decreased. Compared with the general population, EMS providers are at higher risk of contracting the SARS virus regardless of different perceived levels of risk. Standard protections and procedures for infection control should be strictly followed during transport and within the hospital environment.",M1
15278018,"The challenge of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in dentistry.Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly identified coronavirus, called <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) that appears to be transmitted primarily through droplets of saliva. This is the reason why the most important international organizations recommend that the dentists adopt a unique preventive approach to the problem: SARS patients should not be treated in the dental office. This is possible only if a suspected case of SARS is correctly and promptly identified. But a correct identification is made difficult by several factors, such as the incubation period, a possibly asymptomatic onset of the illness, the still low specificity and sensitivity of laboratory and instrumental tests. A case or suspected case of SARS may thus unwillingly be treated at the dental office. It is therefore necessary to adopt protective measures for the dental personnel and to implement and enforce infection control measures in order to eliminate the risk of viral contamination. Nonetheless, these procedures do not ensure a complete elimination of SARS-CoV contamination risk since a major risk is represented by blood-borne infection, which is originated by the mouth of patients, and the contamination of dental units water lines (DUWLs) is most difficult to control. Blood-borne contamination may be achieved only by adopting a high level, between-patients disinfection protocol of the DUWLs based on the use of chemical agents with biocidal activity against spores, viruses, bacteria and fungi (Autosteril method). In conclusion a fully effective control of the cross-infection risk will be obtained only by adopting a correct, integrated use of different infection control procedures.",M1
15173534,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome among children.OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features, prognostic indicators, and short-term to medium-term outcomes for children with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to validate the performance characteristics of a clinical case definition, calculated with respect to <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) seroconversion. METHODS: Children &lt;18 years of age, from a single-site outbreak, who satisfied a clinical case definition for SARS, with subsequent serologic confirmation, were treated according to a standard protocol and prospectively monitored. RESULTS: Forty-four children were included. The median age was 12 years. Forty-two children (95.5%) demonstrated an epidemiologic link. Fever, cough, malaise, coryza, sputum production, headache, myalgia, lymphopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were common presenting features. Radiographic findings were nonspecific, but high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax was an early diagnostic aid. A specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV yielded positive results for &lt;50% of children. Of 9 children who developed hypoxemia, 8 were treated with methylprednisolone. Of 5 children who received intensive care, 3 required assisted ventilation. All children recovered, and serious adverse events in response to treatment were not observed. The outcomes at 3 to 6 months after disease onset, including exercise tolerance, pulmonary functions, and psychologic status, were favorable. An age of &gt;12 years was associated with methylprednisolone therapy for severe illness. After exclusion of the only infant, an age of &gt;12 years was associated with oxygen requirements. Sore throat, high neutrophil count at presentation, and peak neutrophilia were independent factors predicting severe illness. The clinical case definition demonstrated good sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (97.8%, 92.7%, 88%, and 98.7%, respectively) for diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Children are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. Teenagers resemble adults with respect to disease progression and may develop severe illness. The short-term to medium-term outcomes are good. Sore throat and initial and peak neutrophilia seem to be predictors of severe illness. Our clinical case definition performed well in the epidemic.",M1
15158632,"Viral shedding patterns of coronavirus in patients with probable severe acute respiratory syndrome.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is thought to be caused by a novel coronavirus, <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e>. We studied viral shedding of SARS coronavirus to improve diagnosis and infection control. Reverse-transcriptase PCR was done on 2134 specimens of different types. 355 (45%) specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirates and 150 (28%) of faeces were positive for SARS coronavirus RNA. Positive rates peaked at 6-11 days after onset of illness for nasopharyngeal aspirates (87 of 149 [58%], to 37 of 62 [60%]), and 9-14 days for faeces (15 of 22 [68%], to 26 of 37 [70%]). Overall, peak viral loads were reached at 12-14 days of illness when patients were probably in hospital care, which would explain why hospital workers were prone to infection. Low rate of viral shedding in the first few days of illness meant that early isolation measures would probably be effective.",M1

Binding analysis of SARS coronavirus main proteinase with HIV, psychotic and parasite drugs.The <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) main proteinase is a key enzyme in viral polyprotein processing. To allow structure-based design of drugs directed at SARS-CoV main proteinase, we predicted its binding pockets and affinities with existing HIV, psychotic and parasite drugs (lopinavir, ritonavir, niclosamide and promazine), which show signs of inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV. Our results suggest that these drugs and another two HIV inhibitors (PNU and UC2) could be used as templates for designing SARS-CoV proteinase inhibitors.",M1
15098644,"Laboratory safety aspects of SARS at Biosafety Level 2.The severe acute respiratory syndrome <e>(SARS)-associated coronavirus</e> causes severe disease, is transmissible to the community and there is no effective prophylaxis or treatment--perhaps fulfilling the criteria for biohazard group 3 or 4. The recommendation to use Biosafety Level (BSL)3 practices within a BSL2 environment appears to have been a practical decision based on available resources; most diagnostic laboratories operate at BSL2. Safety is achieved with controls in administration, engineering and personal protective equipment/behaviour. At the heart of every safety policy is a risk assessment based on the exact manipulations employed. Excessive administrative and engineering controls are less important than the training and personal attitudes, abilities and understanding of the staff. The SARS outbreak focused our attention on the safety aspects of common mundane tasks, such as decapping blood tubes. Laboratories often claim they follow certain practices but casual observation does not always support these claims. Guidelines differed and created uncertainty. This was stressful for laboratory staff held accountable for their implementation. Attempts to categorise risks and their management into neatly wrapped parcels are attractive, but closer inspection reveals a subjective element that allows doubt to creep in with varying interpretations of the literature. Staff most at risk were those handling respiratory samples. Staff receiving samples via pneumatic tubes had least control over their exposure and were potentially exposed to aerosols from leaking samples. Risk assessment remains a balance between cost and benefit.",M1

We used a standardized reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay to detect SARS-CoV in lung samples obtained from well-characterized patients who died of SARS and from those who died of other reasons. SARS-CoV was detected in all 22 postmortem lung tissues (to 10(9) viral copies/g) from 11 patients with probable SARS but was not detected in any of the 23 lung control samples (sample analysis was blinded). The sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) were 100% (84.6% to 100%) and 100% (85.1% to 100%), respectively. Viral loads were significantly associated with a shorter course of illness but not with the use of ribavirin or steroids. CoV was consistently identified in the lungs of all patients who died of SARS but not in control patients, supporting a primary role for CoV in deaths.",M1

15030690,"Lack of SARS transmission among healthcare workers, United States.Healthcare workers accounted for a large proportion of persons with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the worldwide epidemic of early 2003. We conducted an investigation of healthcare workers exposed to laboratory-confirmed SARS patients in the United States to evaluate infection-control practices and possible <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) transmission. We identified 110 healthcare workers with exposure within droplet range (i.e., 3 feet) to six SARS-CoV-positive patients. Forty-five healthcare workers had exposure without any mask use, 72 had exposure without eye protection, and 40 reported direct skin-to-skin contact. Potential droplet- and aerosol-generating procedures were infrequent: 5% of healthcare workers manipulated a patient's airway, and 4% administered aerosolized medication. Despite numerous unprotected exposures, there was no serologic evidence of healthcare-related SARS-CoV transmission. Lack of transmission in the United States may be related to the relative absence of high-risk procedures or patients, factors that may place healthcare workers at higher risk for infection.",M1
15030686,"Lack of SARS transmission and U.S. SARS case-patient.In early April 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was diagnosed in a Pennsylvania resident after his exposure to persons with SARS in Toronto, Canada. To identify contacts of the case-patient and evaluate the risk for SARS transmission, a detailed epidemiologic investigation was performed. On the basis of this investigation, 26 persons (17 healthcare workers, 4 household contacts, and 5 others) were identified as having had close contact with this case-patient before infection-control practices were implemented. Laboratory evaluation of clinical specimens showed no evidence of transmission of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) infection to any close contact of this patient. This investigation documents that, under certain circumstances, SARS-CoV is not readily transmitted to close contacts, despite ample unprotected exposures.

15030685,"Risk factors for SARS among persons without known contact with SARS patients, Beijing, China.Most cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have occurred in close contacts of SARS patients. However, in Beijing, a large proportion of SARS cases occurred in persons without such contact. We conducted a case-control study in Beijing that compared exposures of 94 unlinked, probable SARS patients with those of 281 community-based controls matched for age group and sex. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have chronic medical conditions or to have visited fever clinics (clinics at which possible SARS patients were separated from other patients), eaten outside the home, or taken taxis frequently. The use of masks was strongly protective. Among 31 case-patients for whom convalescent-phase (&gt;21 days) sera were available, 26% had immunoglobulin G to <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e>. Our finding that clinical SARS was associated with visits to fever clinics supports Beijing's strategy of closing clinics with poor infection-control measures. Our finding that mask use lowered the risk for disease supports the community's use of this strategy.",M1
15003670,"Infection control for SARS in a tertiary paediatric centre in Hong Kong.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease. After the appearance of an index patient in Hong Kong in February 2003, SARS outbreaks occurred rapidly in hospitals and spread to the community. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a triage policy and risk-stratified infection control measures in preventing nosocomial SARS infection among paediatric healthcare workers (HCWs) at the Prince of Wales Hospital, a general hospital to which children with SARS are referred in Hong Kong. The acute paediatric wards were stratified into three areas: (1) ultra high-risk area, (2) high-risk area and (3) moderate-risk area according to different risk levels of nosocomial SARS transmission. The implementation of different levels of infection control precautions was guided by this risk stratification strategy. Between 13 March and 23 June, 38 patients with probable and suspected SARS, 90 patients with non-SARS pneumonia, and 510 patients without pneumonia were admitted into our unit. All probable SARS cases were isolated in negative-pressure rooms. Twenty-six HCWs worked in the ultra high-risk area caring for SARS patients and 88 HCWs managed non-SARS patients in other ward areas. None of the HCWs developed clinical features suggestive of SARS. In addition, there was no nosocomial spread of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> to other patients or visitors during this period. In conclusion, stringent infection control precautions, appropriate triage and prompt isolation of potential SARS patients may have contributed to a lack of nosocomial spread and HCW acquisition of SARS in our unit.",M1
14990151,"[Characterization of peripheral dendritic cell subsets and its implication in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the dynamic changes of dendritic cell subsets in peripheral blood of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and evaluate their roles in the immunopathogenesis of SARS. METHODS: Flow cytometry was applied to study the dynamic alteration of the number and frequencies in circulating DC cell subsets in 30 SARS patients including critical SARS (n = 11) and general SARS (n = 19). The reasons and clinic significances of the peripheral blood DC subsets changes in SARS patients were also analyzed in our study. RESULTS: The patients in critical status had a 9-week course of disease, longer than the 6-week course observed in subjects in general status. The frequency of peripheral DC cell subsets significantly dropped beginning from the onset of symptom in SARS patients and was maintained at significant low levels during the following 4 - 5 weeks, 1.7 +/- 1.8, 5.3 +/- 5.0/ micro l for DC1, 0.57 +/- 1.02, 0.98 +/- 1.11/ micro l for DC2 for cases in critical and general statuses, respectively, compared with healthy subjects; more importantly, the pDC2 even disappeared in the patients who died from SARS diseases. The possible reasons responsible for the alteration of DC subsets in peripheral blood is likely to be the direct attack of SARS-CoVin circulation and be partially involved the application of large dose of steroid. The frequency in DC cell subsets returned to normal level in convalescent stage. CONCLUSION: Our results showed SARS patients had a significant decrease of circulating DC cell subset frequency, which maybe lead to the host immunodeficiency response to <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV).",M1
14985565,"Role of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of SARS: initial virological and clinical findings.BACKGROUND: The clinical response of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin was examined after establishing the in vitro antiviral susceptibility of the <e>SARS associated coronavirus</e> to a panel of antiviral agents. METHODS: The in vitro susceptibility of the prototype of SARS associated coronavirus to a panel of nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors currently licensed for clinical use was studied. Forty one patients with SARS followed for 3 weeks were treated with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin. The clinical progress and virological outcomes were monitored and compared with 111 patients treated with ribavirin only who served as historical controls. RESULTS: In vitro antiviral activity against SARS associated coronavirus was demonstrated for lopinavir and ribavirin at concentrations of 4 micro g/ml and 50 micro g/ml, respectively, only at 48 hours. The adverse clinical outcome (ARDS or death) was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the historical controls (2.4% v 28.8%, p&lt;0.001) at day 21 after the onset of symptoms. The adverse outcome remained significantly lower in the treatment group than in the controls-both those diagnosed early (p&lt;0.001) and those diagnosed later in the course of the epidemic (p = 0.002)-but there was no significant difference in adverse outcome rates between the two time periods (p = 0.548). No time related difference in outcome was observed in the control groups. A reduction in steroid usage and nosocomial infections was seen in patients initially treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, and these patients had a decreasing viral load and rising peripheral lymphocyte count. Multivariate analysis showed that age, hepatitis B carrier status, and lack of treatment with this antiviral combination were independent predictors of an adverse outcome. Lopinavir/ritonavir treatment was associated with a better outcome even when adjusted for baseline lactate dehydrogenase level. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent favourable clinical response with lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin supports further randomised placebo controlled trials in patients with SARS.",M1

14966229,"Modelling potential responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome in Japan: the role of initial attack size, precaution, and quarantine.BACKGROUND: There has been an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide. With the use of detailed epidemiological data from other countries, this article describes the possible reason for the SARS epidemic not appearing in Japan, and simulates the impact of different control strategies that can break the transmission cycle of <e>SARS associated coronavirus</e>. METHOD: Mathematical modelling is used for predicting the epidemiological outcome and simultaneously for evaluating the effect of interventions on SARS. The study estimates the initial attack size that would result in failed invasion. Three different interventions have been incorporated into the public health response policies; precautionary public health measures, isolation of infected people, and quarantine of exposed humans. RESULTS: The maximum number of humans newly infected could be roughly estimated on the basis of the initial attack size, using simple formulas. It is seen that the introduction of only a few cases into certain communities would not lead easily to an epidemic. The possible trajectories of SARS epidemic depend on the levels of public health interventions as quarantine and precautionary public health measures greatly affected the transmissibility of the disease. It is shown that there exist threshold levels of interventions at which the SARS epidemic settles down. CONCLUSION: Initial attack size is one of the determinants of whether SARS can successfully invade the community or not. Two of the most effective policy procedures to prevent new infections would be to apply stringent precautionary measures and to impose quicker and more effective quarantine of the exposed populace.",M1
14767982,"SARS-associated viral hepatitis caused by a novel coronavirus: report of three cases.Liver impairment is commonly reported in up to 60% of patients who suffer from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Here we report the clinical course and liver pathology in three SARS patients with liver impairment. Three patients who fulfilled the World Health Organization case definition of probable SARS and developed marked elevation of alanine aminotransferase were included. Percutaneous liver biopsies were performed. Liver specimens were examined by light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using enhanced real-time PCR was applied to look for evidence of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> infection. Marked accumulation of cells in mitosis was observed in two patients and apoptosis was observed in all three patients. Other common pathologic features included ballooning of hepatocytes and mild to moderate lobular lymphocytic infiltration. No eosinophilic infiltration, granuloma, cholestasis, fibrosis, or fibrin deposition was noted. Immunohistochemical studies revealed 0.5% to 11.4% of nuclei were positive for proliferative antigen Ki-67. RT-PCR showed evidence of SARS-associated coronavirus in the liver tissues, but not in the sera of all 3 patients. However, electron microscopy could not identify viral particles. No giant mitochondria, micro- or macro-vesicular steatosis was observed. In conclusion, hepatic impairment in patients with SARS is due to SARS-associated coronavirus infection of the liver. The prominence of mitotic activity of hepatocytes is unique and may be due to a hyperproliferative state with or without disruption of cell cycle by the coronavirus. With better knowledge of pathogenesis, specific therapy may be targeted to reduce viral replication and modify the disease course.",M1
14716225,"High-resolution computed tomography is useful for early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus pneumonia in patients with normal chest radiographs.OBJECTIVE: We investigated the usefulness of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in early detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus pneumonia and analyzed HRCT findings associated with potentially more severe disease. METHODS: All patients with suspected SARS and normal chest radiographs on admission within the study period were subjected to HRCT examination. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data of patients who were confirmed to have <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> infection by a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate, stool or urine reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or serological testing were prospectively followed up and analyzed. Characteristics of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those that were not were compared. RESULTS: Among 47 suspected SARS patients with normal chest radiographs, 27 had SARS-associated coronavirus infection confirmed by RT-PCR and/or positive serological testing. Twenty-five of the 27 (93%) patients had HRCT changes compatible with atypical pneumonia, and all 25 patients developed SARS with progressive clinical deterioration. Ten (40%) had unifocal diseases, and 15 had multifocal diseases (60%). Ten (40%) patients had the diseases confined to 1 single lung in the first HRCT, and both lungs were involved at initial presentation in 15 (60%) patients. Concerning the overall extent of the disease at initial presentation, 3 (12%) patients had disease process in all lobes, and the disease was confined to 1 single lobe in 10 (40%) patients. The disease process was mainly peripheral in location (96%), and the lower lobes were more commonly involved (68% in the left lower lobe and 64% in the right lower lobe). Small parapneumonic effusions occurred in 1 (4%) patient. None of the patients with unifocal lesions or single-lung involvement were admitted to the ICU (P &lt; 0.05) (in both comparisons). Subsequent follow-up of the 2 (7%) patients with normal HRCT on admission showed that they were having nonpneumonic SARS-associated coronavirus infection only and were eventually denotified from having SARS. CONCLUSIONS: HRCT is useful for early diagnosis of SARS-associated coronavirus pneumonia in patients with normal chest radiographs. HRCT findings in these patients predict potentially severe disease.",M1
14707219,"Interpretation of diagnostic laboratory tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome: the Toronto experience.BACKGROUND: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) began in Canada in February 2003. The initial diagnosis of SARS was based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. During the outbreak, molecular and serologic tests for the <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) became available. However, without a  gold standard,  it was impossible to determine the usefulness of these tests. We describe how these tests were used during the first phase of the SARS outbreak in Toronto and offer some recommendations that may be useful if SARS returns. METHODS: We examined the results of all diagnostic laboratory tests used in 117 patients admitted to hospitals in Toronto who met the Health Canada criteria for suspect or probable SARS. Focusing on tests for SARS-CoV, we attempted to determine the optimal specimen types and timing of specimen collection. RESULTS: Diagnostic test results for SARS-CoV were available for 110 of the 117 patients. SARS-CoV was detected by means of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in at least one specimen in 59 (54.1%) of 109 patients. Serologic test results of convalescent samples were positive in 50 (96.2%) of 52 patients for whom paired serum samples were collected during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. Of the 110 patients, 78 (70.9%) had specimens that tested positive by means of RT-PCR, serologic testing or both methods. The proportion of RT-PCR test results that were positive was similar between patients who met the criteria for suspect SARS (50.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.4%-63.2%) and those who met the criteria for probable SARS (58.0%, 95% CI 44.2%-70.7%). SARS-CoV was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs in 33 (32.4%) of 102 patients, in stool specimens in 19 (63.3%) of 30 patients, and in specimens from the lower respiratory tract in 10 (58.8%) of 17 patients. INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that the rapid diagnostic tests in use at the time of the initial outbreak lack sufficient sensitivity to be used clinically to rule out SARS. As tests for SARS-CoV continue to be optimized, evaluation of the clinical presentation and elucidation of a contact history must remain the cornerstone of SARS diagnosis. In patients with SARS, specimens taken from the lower respiratory tract and stool samples test positive by means of RT-PCR more often than do samples taken from other areas.",M1
14702488,"Inflammatory cytokine profile in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome.OBJECTIVE: To study the inflammatory cytokine profile in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to investigate whether monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) could be considered for treatment of these patients. METHODS: Plasma inflammatory cytokine concentrations (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, and TNF-alpha) were monitored longitudinally on admission, immediately before corticosteroids, and 1 to 2 days and 7 to 10 days after the drug treatment in a cohort of pediatric patients (n = 8) with virologic confirmed <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> infection. None of the patients required mechanical ventilation or intensive care treatment. All children except 1 (patient 3) received corticosteroids. RESULTS: Plasma IL-1beta levels (excluding patient 3) were substantially elevated immediately before (range: 7-721 ng/L) and 7 to 10 days after (range: 7-664 ng/L) corticosteroid treatment. In contrast, the plasma concentrations of other key proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-alpha, were not overtly increased in any of the patients throughout the course of illness. In addition, plasma IL-10 concentration was significantly lower 1 to 2 days and 7 to 10 days after corticosteroid treatment, compared with the immediate pretreatment level. Similarly, plasma IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were significantly decreased 7 to 10 days after the drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric SARS patients have markedly elevated circulating IL-1beta levels, which suggests selective activation of the caspase-1-dependent pathway. Other key proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, showed only mildly elevated levels at the initial phase of the illness. The current evidence does not support the use of TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody in this group of children.",M1
14681507,"Transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome on aircraft.BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly around the world, largely because persons infected with the <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) traveled on aircraft to distant cities. Although many infected persons traveled on commercial aircraft, the risk, if any, of in-flight transmission is unknown. METHODS: We attempted to interview passengers and crew members at least 10 days after they had taken one of three flights that transported a patient or patients with SARS. All index patients met the criteria of the World Health Organization for a probable case of SARS, and index or secondary cases were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or serologic testing. RESULTS: After one flight carrying a symptomatic person and 119 other persons, laboratory-confirmed SARS developed in 16 persons, 2 others were given diagnoses of probable SARS, and 4 were reported to have SARS but could not be interviewed. Among the 22 persons with illness, the mean time from the flight to the onset of symptoms was four days (range, two to eight), and there were no recognized exposures to patients with SARS before or after the flight. Illness in passengers was related to the physical proximity to the index patient, with illness reported in 8 of the 23 persons who were seated in the three rows in front of the index patient, as compared with 10 of the 88 persons who were seated elsewhere (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.9). In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission are warranted.",M1

SETTING: 529-bed community hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: 40 hospital workers infected with <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> over a 6-week period (25 March through 5 May 2003). MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of infected hospital workers according to job category. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence was highest among health care assistants, followed by physicians and nurses (8%, 5%, and 4%, respectively). Most hospital workers were infected from direct contact with patients with SARS, who primarily were in general wards and had unsuspected infection. At the time of contact, all hospital workers had used masks but not necessarily other protective devices. Affected hospital workers did not infect their families. CONCLUSION: Before isolation of all patients with clinically confirmed or suspected SARS, routine use of several protective devices, and training of staff in infection control, many health care workers were infected with SARS from patients with unsuspected cases.",M1

12918094,"Current status of severe acute respiratory syndrome in China.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), also called infectious atypical pneumonia, is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel variant of coronavirus (<e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e>, SARS-CoV). It is mainly characterized by pulmonary infection with a high infectivity and fatality. SARS is swept across almost all the continents of the globe, and has currently involved 33 countries and regions, including the mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, North America and Europe. On June 30, 2003, an accumulative total reached 8450 cases with 810 deaths. SARS epidemic was very rampant in March, April and May 2003 in the mainland of China and Hong Kong. Chinese scientists and healthcare workers cooperated closely with other scientists from all over the world to fight the disease. On April 16, 2003, World Health Organization (WHO) formally declared that SARS-CoV was an etiological agent of SARS. Currently, there is no specific and effective therapy and prevention method for SARS. The main treatments include corticosteroid therapy, anti-viral agents, anti-infection, mechanical ventilation and isolation. This disease can be prevented and controlled, and it is also curable. Under the endeavor of the Chinese Government, medical staffs and other related professionals, SARS has been under control in China, and Chinese scientists have also made a great contribution to SARS research.

12881699,"Use of quarantine to prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome--Taiwan, 2003.On July 5, 2003, Taiwan was removed from the World Health Organization (WHO) list of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-affected countries. As of July 9, a total of 671 probable cases of SARS had been reported in Taiwan. On February 21, the first identified SARS patient in Taiwan returned from travel to Guangdong Province, mainland China, by way of Hong Kong. Initial efforts to control SARS appeared to be effective; these efforts included isolation of suspect and probable SARS patients, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health-care workers (HCWs) and visitors, and quarantine of contacts of known SARS patients. However, beginning in mid-April, unrecognized cases of SARS led to a large nosocomial cluster and subsequent <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> transmission to other health-care facilities and community settings. In response to the growing epidemic, additional measures were taken to limit nosocomial and community transmission of SARS, including more widespread use of quarantine. By the end of the epidemic, 131,132 persons had been placed in quarantine, including 50,319 close contacts of SARS patients and 80,813 travelers from WHO-designated SARS-affected areas.

Over 1,000 patients died of the SARS virus, representing 10% of infected people. Like other coronaviruses, the SARS virus also utilizes a surface glycoprotein, namely the spike protein, to infect host cells. The spike protein of SARS virus consists of 1,255 amino acid residues and can be divided into two sub-domains, S1 and S2. The S1 domain mediates the binding of the virus to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is abundantly distributed on the surface of human lung cells. The S2 domain mediates membrane fusion between the virus and the host cell. Hence two strategies can be used to block the infection of the SARS virus, either by interfering with the binding of the S1 domain to the receptor or by blocking the fusion of the virus with the cell membrane mediated by the S2 domain. Several antibodies against the S1 domain have been generated and all of them are able to neutralize the virus in vitro and in vivo using animal models. Unfortunately, point mutations have been identified in the S1 domain, so that the virus isolated in the future may not be recognized by these antibodies. As no mutation has been found in the S2 domain indicating that this region is more conserved than the S1 domain, it may be a better target for antibody binding. After predicting the immunogenicity of the epitopes of the S2 domain, we chemically synthesized two peptides and also expressed one of them using a recombinant DNA method.

Flexibility with respect to the peptide tag is essential since no single tag suites all purposes. This report describes the usage of two short peptides from the SARS-associated coronavirus nucleocapsid (SARS-N) protein as protein tags. Plasmids for the generation of tagged proteins were generated by ligating synthetic oligonucleotides for the peptide-coding regions downstream of the protein coding sequence. The data show recognition of prokaryotically expressed HIV-1 Gag/p24 fusion protein by Western blot and efficient affinity purification using monoclonal antibodies against the tags. The SARS peptide antibody system described presents an alternative tagging opportunity in the growing field of protein science.",M2
18468073,"Combination of functionalized nanoparticles and polymerase chain reaction-based method for SARS-CoV gene detection.Rapid and sensitive detection of <e>SARS associated coronavirus</e> is critical for early diagnosis and control of severe acute respiratory syndrome. This study describes a method for the detection of SARS associated coronavirus gene by the combination of functionalized nanoparticles and PCR-based assay. In this method, the target cDNA of SARS associated coronavirus was firstly captured and enriched from the mixture of target cDNA and non-target cDNA by the use of the functionalized silica coated superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Additionally, the enriched target cDNA were amplified through a general symmetry PCR and then was selectively isolated from the double strands PCR products by applying the silica coated superparamagnetic nanoparticles again. Finally, we detected the amplified target cDNA by employing the functionalized silica coated fluorescent nanoparticles as signaling probes with a sandwich hybridization format. The results show that the target cDNA can be assayed successfully with a detection limit of 2.0 x 10(3) copies and the nonspecific amplification could be inhibited. In addition, the detection procedure is rapid and can be completed in less than 6 h. Our results suggest that this approach will provide promising prospects for other pathogens detection.",M2
18449585,"siRNA silencing of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 reduced severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus replications in Vero E6 cells.The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 has had a significant impact worldwide. No effective prophylaxis or treatment for SARS is available up to now. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV). By expressing a U6 promoter-driven small interfering RNA containing sequences homologous to part of ACE2 mRNA, we successfully silenced ACE2 expression in Vero E6 cells. By detecting negative strand SARS-CoV RNA and measuring RNA copy numbers of SARS-CoV by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we demonstrated that SARS-CoV infection was reduced in the ACE2-silenced cell lines. These findings support the involvement of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infections and provide a basis for further studies on potential use of siRNA targeting ACE2 as a preventive or therapeutic strategy for SARS.",M2

Nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV encapsidates the viral RNA and plays an important role in virus particle assembly and release. In this study, the N protein of SARS-CoV was found to associate with B23, a phosphoprotein in nucleolus, in vitro and in vivo. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acid residues 175-210, which included a serine/arginine (SR)-rich domain.

18077725,"Difference in receptor usage between severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and SARS-like coronavirus of bat origin.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by the <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV), which uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor for cell entry. A group of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) has been identified in horseshoe bats. SL-CoVs and SARS-CoVs share identical genome organizations and high sequence identities, with the main exception of the N terminus of the spike protein (S), known to be responsible for receptor binding in CoVs. In this study, we investigated the receptor usage of the SL-CoV S by combining a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudovirus system with cell lines expressing the ACE2 molecules of human, civet, or horseshoe bat. In addition to full-length S of SL-CoV and SARS-CoV, a series of S chimeras was constructed by inserting different sequences of the SARS-CoV S into the SL-CoV S backbone. Several important observations were made from this study. First, the SL-CoV S was unable to use any of the three ACE2 molecules as its receptor. Second, the SARS-CoV S failed to enter cells expressing the bat ACE2. Third, the chimeric S covering the previously defined receptor-binding domain gained its ability to enter cells via human ACE2, albeit with different efficiencies for different constructs. Fourth, a minimal insert region (amino acids 310 to 518) was found to be sufficient to convert the SL-CoV S from non-ACE2 binding to human ACE2 binding, indicating that the SL-CoV S is largely compatible with SARS-CoV S protein both in structure and in function. The significance of these findings in relation to virus origin, virus recombination, and host switching is discussed.",M2
18055455,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus nucleocapsid protein interacts with Smad3 and modulates transforming growth factor-beta signaling.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease with significant mortality. A typical clinical feature associated with SARS is pulmonary fibrosis and the associated lung failure. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein potentiates transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 but attenuates Smad3/Smad4-mediated apoptosis of human peripheral lung epithelial HPL1 cells. The promoting effect of N protein on the transcriptional responses of TGF-beta is Smad3-specific. N protein associates with Smad3 and promotes Smad3-p300 complex formation while it interferes with the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4. These findings provide evidence of a novel mechanism whereby N protein modulates TGF-beta signaling to block apoptosis of SARS-CoV-infected host cells and meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis. Our results reveal a novel mode of Smad3 action in a Smad4-independent manner and may lead to successful strategies for SARS treatment by targeting the TGF-beta signaling molecules.",M2

The complex structures reveal two major inhibition modes: Hg(2+)-PMA is coordinated to C(44), M(49) and Y(54) with a square planar geometry at the S3 pocket, whereas each Zn(2+) of the four zinc-inhibitors is tetrahedrally coordinated to the H(41)-C(145) catalytic dyad.

17715225,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus evades antiviral signaling: role of nsp1 and rational design of an attenuated strain.The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was caused by the spread of a previously unrecognized infectious agent, the <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV). Here we show that SARS-CoV could inhibit both virus- and interferon (IFN)-dependent signaling, two key steps of the antiviral response. We mapped a strong inhibitory activity to SARS-CoV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) and show that expression of nsp1 significantly inhibited the activation of all three virus-dependent signaling pathways. We show that expression of nsp1 significantly inhibited IFN-dependent signaling by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of STAT1 while having little effect on those of STAT2, JAK1, and TYK2. We engineered an attenuated mutant of nsp1 in SARS-CoV through reverse genetics, and the resulting mutant virus was viable and replicated as efficiently as wild-type virus in cells with a defective IFN response. However, mutant virus replication was strongly attenuated in cells with an intact IFN response. Thus, nsp1 is likely a virulence factor that contributes to pathogenicity by favoring SARS-CoV replication.",M2
17605471,"Substrate specificity profiling and identification of a new class of inhibitor for the major protease of the SARS coronavirus.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a high rate of mortality. The <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the etiological agent of the disease. Although public health procedures have been effective in combating the spread of SARS, concern remains about the possibility of a recurrence. Various approaches are being pursued for the development of efficacious therapeutics. One promising approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the essential major polyprotein processing protease 3Clpro. Here we report a complete description of the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 3Clpro using fully degenerate peptide libraries consisting of all 160,000 possible naturally occurring tetrapeptides. The substrate specificity data show the expected P1-Gln P2-Leu specificity and elucidate a novel preference for P1-His containing substrates equal to the expected preference for P1-Gln. These data were then used to develop optimal substrates for a high-throughput screen of a 2000 compound small-molecule inhibitor library consisting of known cysteine protease inhibitor scaffolds. We also report the 1.8 A X-ray crystal structure of 3Clpro bound to an irreversible inhibitor. This inhibitor, an alpha,beta-epoxyketone, inhibits 3Clpro with a k3/Ki of 0.002 microM(-1) s(-1) in a mode consistent with the substrate specificity data. Finally, we report the successful rational improvement of this scaffold with second generation inhibitors.

Recent studies revealed that M protein could interact with N protein in the Golgi complex. In this study, we showed that SCoV M protein co-localized in the Golgi apparatus with a Golgi vector marker. To study M protein function, three candidate small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) corresponding to M gene sequences were designed, transcribed in vitro, and then tested for their ability to silence M protein expression. The plasmid, pEGFP-M, encoding SCoV M protein as a fusion protein with EGFP, was used for silencing and for reporter gene detection in HEK 293T cells transfected with siRNA constructs. The results showed that the mean green fluorescence intensity and M RNA transcripts were significantly reduced, and that the expression of M glycoprotein was strongly inhibited in those cells co-transfected with M-specific siRNAs. These findings demonstrated that the three M-specific siRNAs were able to specifically and effectively inhibit M glycoprotein expression in cultured cells by blocking the accumulation of mRNA, which provides an approach for studies on the functions of M protein and for the development of novel prophylactic or therapeutic agents for SCoV infection.",M2

A single chain variable fragment antibody (N18) with high affinity against N protein of SARS-CoV was isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that the VL gene was composed of VL3h (V lambda subgroup) and JL2 regions and the VH gene was composed of VH1-69 (VH1 subgroup), D2-15, D3-22 and JH6 regions. Soluble N18 antibody was expressed in Escherichia coli HB2151, purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.

17267381,"Spike protein of SARS-CoV stimulates cyclooxygenase-2 expression via both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent protein kinase C pathways.We have previously shown that the nucleocapsid protein of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) activated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. In this study, we identified another viral protein, the spike of SARS-CoV, which played an important role in virus-stimulated COX-2 expression after screening all genes from the SARS-CoV genome. We found that an upstream calcium-dependent PKC isozyme PKC alpha that modulates the downstream ERK/NF-kappaB pathway through an influx of extracellular Ca2+ is induced by the spike protein of SARS-CoV. The ERK/NF-kappaB was identified to be involved in the activation of COX-2 promoter and production of COX-2 protein in HEK293T cells. We also demonstrated that another unusual pathway, the calcium-independent PI3K/PKC epsilon/JNK/CREB pathway, functioned in cooperation with the calcium-dependent pathway to induce COX-2 expression upon stimulation by spike protein. This pathway can be blocked by PKC epsilon-specific, small interfering RNA, PI3K/JNK kinase-specific inhibitors as well as dominant negative JNK. PKC epsilon-specific siRNA also attenuated the phosphorylation of JNK. Our results provide evidence that helps us understand the function of SRAS-CoV spike protein in SARS pathogenesis.",M2

Although the initial SARS epidemic was contained, sporadic outbreaks of the disease still occur, suggesting a continuous need for a vaccine against this virus. We therefore explored exosome-based vaccines containing the spike S proteins of SARS-CoV. S-containing exosomes were obtained by replacing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the S protein by those of VSV-G. The immunogenicity and efficacy of the S-containing exosomes were tested in mice and compared to an adenoviral vector vaccine expressing the S protein. Both, S-containing exosomes and the adenoviral vector vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers. After priming with the SARS-S exosomal vaccine and boosting with the adenoviral vector the neutralizing antibody titers exceeded those observed in the convalescent serum of a SARS patient. Both approaches were effective in a SARS-S-expressing tumor challenge model and thus warrant further investigation.",M2

The entire ectodomain of S protein was fused between the gp64 signal peptide and the VSV-G membrane anchor and successfully displayed on the baculovirus surface. Subcutaneous injection with purified S-displayed baculoviruses without adjuvant elicited highly effective production of specific and neutralizing antibodies against S protein in mice. These results confirmed a successful surface display of S protein on baculoviruse, and suggested a potential role of S-displayed baculoviruses as a novel live virus-based vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV.",M2

Currently, there is no efficient treatment and prevention for this disease. We constructed recombinant adenoviral vectors that can express shRNAs, which inhibited the expression of SARS-CoV genes effectively in mammalian cells. METHODS: In this study, we designed several plasmids that express small hairpin RNA molecules (shRNA) specifically targeting to the genes encoding for the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein and envelope (E) protein, respectively. Effective shRNA molecules to the viral genes were screened and identified, and then constructed into adenovirus vectors. The effects of adenovirus-delivered small hairpin RNA on SARS-CoV gene expression were determined by RT-PCR, Western blot, and luciferase activity assays. RESULTS: The levels of viral mRNAs and viral proteins of the targets were significantly decreased or completely inhibited in cell lines after being infected with the recombinant adenoviruses that expressed specific shRNA molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Since many cell types can be efficiently infected by adenovirus, recombinant adenoviruses could serve as an alternative powerful tool for shRNA delivery and for gene suppression, especially when the targeted cells are resistant to transfection by DNA or RNA. With availability of high titers of adenoviruses and uniform and rapid infection, this approach would have foreseeable wide applications both in experimental biology and molecular medicine.",M2

To evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in the viral infection, in this study, we investigated the role of SARS-CoV Spike (S) protein in the regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Expression of COX-2 stimulated by the S protein was verified by RT-PCR and western blot assay. To explore the relationship between S and COX-2, we constructed a series of plasmids containing truncated N-terminal fragments of the SARS-CoV S gene (designated from Sa to Si), which encoded truncated S proteins, and investigated whether these truncated proteins could induce effective expression of COX-2 in 293T cells. Our results showed that S(d) that encoded a truncated S protein with 422 amino acid residues (from 1 to 422 aa), a part of 672 amino-acid S1 subunit is crucial for the induction of COX-2 expression. Immunofluorescence examinations also give the evidence that these N terminal 422 amino acids of the S protein were also required for the correct localization of the protein. We also compared S protein sequences of SARS-CoV isolated during the SARS break with that from palm civets, a possible source of SARS-CoV found in humans. S protein residues (344, 360), which mutated in the epitome from palm civet to human being were characterized in 3D modeling of 252-375 amino acid fragment. Collectively, these results indicate that S protein of SARS-CoV induces the expression of COX-2 and an N-terminal fragment of the Spike protein is crucial for the induction. Our finding may provide clue for the induction of inflammation by SARS-CoV and cast insight into the severity of the SARS epidemic.",M2
16887973,"Screening and identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-specific CTL epitopes.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and life-threatening disease that emerged in China in November 2002. A novel <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> was identified as its principal etiologic agent; however, the immunopathogenesis of SARS and the role of special CTLs in virus clearance are still largely uncharacterized. In this study, potential HLA-A*0201-restricted spike (S) and nucleocapsid protein-derived peptides were selected from an online database and screened for potential CTL epitopes by in vitro refolding and T2 cell-stabilization assays. The antigenicity of nine peptides which could refold with HLA-A*0201 molecules was assessed with an IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay to determine the capacity to stimulate CTLs from PBMCs of HLA-A2(+) SARS-recovered donors. A novel HLA-A*0201-restricted decameric epitope P15 (S411-420, KLPDDFMGCV) derived from the S protein was identified and found to localize within the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor-binding region of the S1 domain. P15 could significantly enhance the expression of HLA-A*0201 molecules on the T2 cell surface, stimulate IFN-gamma-producing CTLs from the PBMCs of former SARS patients, and induce specific CTLs from P15-immunized HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice in vivo. Furthermore, significant P15-specific CTLs were induced from HLA-A2.1-transgenic mice immunized by a DNA vaccine encoding the S protein; suggesting that P15 was a naturally processed epitope. Thus, P15 may be a novel SARS-associated coronavirus-specific CTL epitope and a potential target for characterization of virus control mechanisms and evaluation of candidate SARS vaccines.",M2

The virus induces severe injury of lung tissue, as well as lymphopenia and destruction of the architecture of lymphatic tissue by as-yet-unknown mechanisms. In this study, the interaction of SARS-CoV with dendritic cells (DCs), the key regulators of immune responses, was analysed. Monocyte-derived DCs were infected with SARS-CoV and analysed for viability, surface-marker expression and alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) induction. SARS-CoV infection was monitored by quantitative RT-PCR, immunofluorescence analysis and recovery experiments. SARS-CoV infected both immature and mature DCs, although replication efficiency was low. Immature DCs were activated by SARS-CoV infection and by UV-inactivated SARS-CoV. Infected DCs were still viable on day 6 post-infection, but major histocompatibility complex class I upregulation was missing, indicating that DC function was impaired. Additionally, SARS-CoV infection induced a delayed activation of IFN-alpha expression. Therefore, it is concluded that SARS-CoV has the ability to circumvent both the innate and the adaptive immune systems.",M2
16652313,"Nasopharyngeal shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus is associated with genetic polymorphisms.BACKGROUND: A high initial or peak severe acute respiratory syndrome <e>(SARS)-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) load in nasopharyngeal specimens was shown to be associated with a high mortality rate. Because all infected individuals were devoid of preeexisting protective immunity against SARS-CoV, the biological basis for the variable virus burdens in different patients remains elusive. METHODS: The nationwide SARS database in Taiwan was analyzed, and genotyping of 281 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 65 genes was performed for 94 patients with SARS, to identify SNPs for which distribution between patients with or without detectable nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV was biased. RESULTS: Titers of SARS-CoV shed in nasopharyngeal specimens varied widely, ranging from nondetectable to 10(8) SARS-CoV RNA copies/mL, and they were correlated positively with a high mortality rate (P&lt;.0001, by trend test) and with early death (i.e., death occurring within 2 weeks of the onset of illness) (P=.0015, by trend test). Virus shedding was found to be higher among male patients (P=.0014, by multivariate logistic regression) and among older patients (P=.015, by multivariate logistic regression). Detectable nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV was associated with polymorphic alleles of interleukins 18 (P=.014) and 1A (P=.031) and a member of NF kappa B complex (reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog B [RelB]) (P=.034), all of which are proinflammatory in nature, as well as the procoagulation molecule fibrinogen-like protein 2 (P=.008). CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV load is a determinant of clinical outcomes of SARS, and it is associated with polymorphisms of genes involved in innate immunity, which might be regulated in an age- and sex-dependent manner. The findings of the present study provided leads to genes involved in the host response to SARS-CoV infection; if substantiated with functional studies, these findings may be applicable to other newly emerged respiratory viruses (e.g., the influenza pandemic strain).",M2

We have previously shown that SARS-CoV N protein forms a dimer in solution through its C-terminal domain. In this study, the crystal structure of the dimerization domain, consisting of residues 270-370, is determined to 1.75A resolution. The structure shows a dimer with extensive interactions between the two subunits, suggesting that the dimeric form of the N protein is the functional unit in vivo. Although lacking significant sequence similarity, the dimerization domain of SARS-CoV N protein has a fold similar to that of the nucleocapsid protein of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.

16571824,"Mucosal immunization with surface-displayed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein on Lactobacillus casei induces neutralizing antibodies in mice.Induction of mucosal immunity may be important for preventing SARS-CoV infections. For safe and effective delivery of viral antigens to the mucosal immune system, we have developed a novel surface antigen display system for lactic acid bacteria using the poly-gamma-glutamic acid synthetase A protein (PgsA) of Bacillus subtilis as an anchoring matrix. Recombinant fusion proteins comprised of PgsA and the Spike (S) protein segments SA (residues 2 to 114) and SB (residues 264 to 596) were stably expressed in Lactobacillus casei. Surface localization of the fusion protein was verified by cellular fractionation analyses, immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry. Oral and nasal inoculations of recombinant L. casei into mice resulted in high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using S protein peptides. More importantly, these antibodies exhibited potent neutralizing activities against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pseudoviruses. Orally immunized mice mounted a greater neutralizing-antibody response than those immunized intranasally. Three new neutralizing epitopes were identified on the S protein using a peptide neutralization interference assay (residues 291 to 308, 520 to 529, and 564 to 581).

The relationship existing between SARS-CoV and other groups of coronaviruses was determined via analyses of phylogenetic trees and comparative genomic analyses of the coronavirus genes: polymerase (Orf1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). Although the coronaviruses are traditionally classed into 3 groups, with SARS-CoV forming a 4th group, the phylogenetic position and origins of SARS-CoV remain a matter of some controversy. Thus, we conducted extensive phylogenetic analyses of the genes common to all coronavirus groups, using the Neighbor-joining, Maximum-likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Our data evidenced largely identical topology for all of the obtained phylogenetic trees, thus supporting the hypothesis that the relationship existing between SARS-CoV and group 2 coronavirus is a monophyletic one. Additional comparative genomic studies, including sequence similarity and protein secondary structure analyses, suggested that SARS-CoV may bear a closer relationship with group 2 than with the other coronavirus groups. Although our data strongly suggest that group 2 coronaviruses are most closely related with SARS-CoV, further and more detailed analyses may provide us with an increased amount of information regarding the origins and evolution of the coronaviruses, most notably SARS-CoV.",M2

To evaluate the molecular mechanisms behind this event, we investigated the roles of SARS-CoV proteins in regulation of the proinflammatory factor, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Individual viral proteins were tested for their abilities to regulate COX-2 gene expression. Results showed that the COX-2 promoter was activated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis indicated that N protein was sufficient to stimulate the production of COX-2 protein in mammalian cells. COX-2 promoter mutations suggested that activation of COX-2 transcription depended on two regulatory elements, a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) binding site, and a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) binding site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that SARS-CoV N protein bound directly to these regulatory sequences. Protein mutation analysis revealed that a Lys-rich motif of N protein acted as a nuclear localization signal and was essential for the activation of COX-2. In addition, a Leu-rich motif was found to be required for the N protein function. A sequence of 68 residuals was identified as a potential DNA-binding domain essential for activating COX-2 expression. We propose that SARS-CoV N protein causes inflammation of the lungs by activating COX-2 gene expression by binding directly to the promoter resulting in inflammation through multiple COX-2 signaling cascades.",M2

A truncated version of S glycoprotein, containing only the ecto-domain, as well as a His-tagged full-length version were cloned and expressed in a serum-free insect cell line, ExpresSF+. The proteins, purified to apparent homogeneity by liquid column chromatography, were formulated without adjuvant at 3, 9, 27, and 50 microg per dose in phosphate saline and used to immunize mice. Both antigens in each formulation elicited a strong immune response after two or three vaccinations with the antigen. Neutralizing antibody titers correlated closely with standard ELISA reactivity against the S glycoprotein. The truncated S protein was also formulated with an adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide, at 1 microg per dose (+/-adjuvant), and 5 microg per dose (+/-adjuvant). Significantly enhanced immune responses, manifested by higher titers of serum ELISA and viral neutralizing antibodies, were achieved in adjuvanted groups with fewer doses and lower concentration of S glycoprotein. These findings indicate that the ecto-domain of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein vaccine, with or without adjuvant, is immunogenic and induces high titers of virus neutralizing antibodies to levels similar to those achieved with the full S glycoprotein vaccine.",M2
16494729,"<e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> replication in cell lines.Given the potential for laboratory-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections, we must know which cell lines are susceptible to the virus. We investigated 21 cell lines routinely used for virus isolation or research. After infection with SARS-CoV, cells were observed for cytopathic effects, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure ongoing viral replication. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was also used as a confirmatory test. The study identified 10 new cell lines capable of supporting the replication of SARS-CoV and confirmed the susceptibility of 4 cell lines previously reported. This study shows that SARS-CoV can be isolated in several cell lines commonly used for diagnostic or research purposes. It also shows that SARS-CoV can achieve high titers in several cell lines, sometimes in the absence of specific cytopathic effects.",M2
16415994,"[Receptor-binding ability of fragments 260-600 and 397-796 of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> spike protein]BACKGROUND: To investigate the interaction between the host cell and the truncated S fragments to identify the receptor-binding domain of the spike (S) protein of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). METHODS: Two different fragments S260-600 and S397-796 of the SARS-CoV S protein were expressed in Escherichia coli (E.coli) using a pET expression vector, respectively. The two recombinant proteins were separately verified by Western blot, purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, and incubated with Vero cells, a susceptible cell line of SARS-CoV infection, for cell binding assay. After the sequential probing with sera from convalescent SARS-patients and FITC-labeled anti-human IgG, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The NIH 3T3 cell, a non-permissive cell line of SARS-CoV infection, was used as controls. RESULTS: The recombinant proteins S260-600 and S397-796 were efficiently expressed in an insoluble form in E.coli. The appropriate expression of the proteins was confirmed by Western blotting using both SARS patients' sera and anti-6 x histidine antibody. The flow cytometry results showed that the both proteins were able to bind Vero cells, but the binding ability of S260-600 was somewhat stronger than that of S397-796. In contrast, the S260-600 protein did not bind NIH3T3 cells. CONCLUSION: Both S260-600 and S397-796 exhibited different receptor binding activity. The S260-600 fragment probably contains the important receptor binding domain and could be a potential candidate for the development of SARS vaccine and anti-SARS therapeutics.",M2

However, the pathophysiological significance of the anti-N antibodies in SARS pathogenesis is largely unknown. To profile the anti-N antibodies, a phage-displayed scFv library was prepared from mice immunized with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cell lysate. Specific anti-N scFvs were isolated by panning against a recombinant nucleocapsid protein and reactivity was confirmed with phage-ELISA. Sequence analysis indicated that two of the isolated anti-N scFv clones were identical and displayed a high homology with an scFv specific for interleukin 11 (IL-11), an anti-inflammatory cytokine derived from bone marrow stroma cells. In a neutralization assay, IL-11-induced STAT 3 phosphorylation in rat intestinal epithelial IEC-18 cells was completely suppressed by the anti-N scFv clone L9N01.",M2

The results of ELISA showed that among 114 sera from healthy controls, 4 (3.5%) were positive of SARS-CoV-IgG antibody and 114 (100%) were all negative of SARS-CoV-IgM antibody; the specificity of SARS-CoV-IgG antibody for SARS patients was 96.5%, but the specificity of both SARS-CoV-IgG and -IgM antibodies for SARS patients was 100%. In 58 cases with SLE, positive rates of SARS-CoV-IgG and -IgM antibodies were 32.8% (19/58) and 8.6% (5/58), respectively, in which 11 cases (19%) were positive of both SARS-CoV-IgG and -IgM antibodies; in 10 cases with SS, positive rate of both SARS-CoV-IgG and -IgM antibodies was 10% (1/10); in 16 cases with MCTD, positive rate of SARS-CoV-IgG was 37.5% (6/16), positive rate of both SARS-CoV-IgG and -IgM antibodies was 6.3% (1/16); in 20 cases with RA, one case was positive (5%) of SARS-CoV-IgG. However, of all samples with positive SARS-CoV-IgG and -IgM antibodies for autoimmune diseases and healthy controls, SARS-CoV RNA and antibodies were all negative by RT-PCR and IFA. All sera for negative or positive ELISA results were also negative or positive results using ELISA with Vero E6 cells lysates. These studies showed that SARS-CoV Vero E6 cell lysates for the ELISA to detect SARS-CoV antibodies could lead to the false-positive reactions or cross-reactions of SARS-CoV antibodies in non-SARS diseases and healthy controls, and the false-positive reactions or cross-reactions were related to Vero E6 cell lysates and autoantibodies in non-SARS population.",M2

It is believed that the modulation of apoptosis is relevant to diseases that are caused by various viruses. To examine potential apoptotic mechanisms related to SARS, we investigated features of apoptosis induced by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in host cells. The results indicated that the SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis in Vero cells in a virus replication-dependent manner. Additionally, the downregulation of Bcl-2, the activation of casapse 3, as well as the upregulation of Bax were detected, suggesting the involvement of the caspase family and the activation of the mitochondrial signaling pathway. Although there is a positive correlation between apoptosis and virus replication, the latter is not significantly blocked by treatment with the caspase inhibitor z-DEVD-FMK.

Previous studies on various coronaviruses indicate that protein-protein interactions amongst various coronavirus proteins are critical for viral assembly and morphogenesis. It is necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV replication and rationalize the anti-SARS therapeutic intervention. In this study, we employed an in vitro GST pull-down assay to investigate the interaction between the membrane (M) and the nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Our results show that the interaction between the M and N proteins does take place in vitro. Moreover, we provide an evidence that 12 amino acids domain (194-205) in the M protein is responsible for binding to N protein.

15968975,"[RNase III-prepared short interfering RNAs induce degradation of SARS-coronavirus mRNAs in human cells]<e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> has been identified for the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, for which there is no efficacious drugs or vaccines. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process in cell to degradation specific target mRNA by double-stranded RNA. In mammalian cells, RNAi can be triggered by short interfering RNA (siRNA). RNA interference of virus-specific genes has emerged as a potential antiviral mechanism. This work evaluated if RNase III-prepared short interfering RNAs can induce specific degradation of SARS-coronavirus mRNAs in human cells. Three of SARS genes, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike and nucleocapsid, were amplified with T7 promoter-flanked primers. Long length double-stranded RNA of these genes were transcribed in vitro and then were cleaved to &lt;30bp length short interfering RNA with E. coli RNase III. These siRNAs were termed esiRNA-R, esiRNA-S and esiRNA-N respectively. RdRp, spike and nucleocapsid DNA fragments were inserted into the plasmid pGL3-Control, obtained plasmids pGL-R, pGL-S and pGL-N can express hybrid mRNAs luciferase-RdRp, spike and -nucleocapsid in cells. Above plasmids and esiRNAs were co-transfected to HEK293F cells with reference plasmid pRL-TK. Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activity were measured. Hybrid mRNAs' abundance was measured using reverse transcription real-time PCR. Firefly luciferase expression of pGL-R was reduced to 13% by esiRNA-R. Expression of pGLS was reduced to 11% by esiRNA-S. Expression of pGL-N was reduced to 40% by esiRNA-N. Control esiRNAs didn't affect luciferase expression; Hybrid mRNAs' abundance was dramatically reduced by corresponding esiRNAs. RNase III-prepared short interfering RNAs induce robust and specific degradation of SARS-coronavirus mRNAs in HEK293F cells. These siRNAs could be used to inhibit SARS-coronavirus in future research.",M2
15918330,"Synthetic peptides outside the spike protein heptad repeat regions as potent inhibitors of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e>.A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS. We previously isolated and characterized SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-like viruses from human and animals, respectively, suggesting that SARS could be transmitted from wild/farmed animals to humans. Comparison of the viral genomes indicated that sequence variation between animal and human isolates existed mainly in the spike (S) gene. We hypothesized that these variations may underlie a change of binding specificity of the S protein to the host cells, permitting viral transmission from animals to humans. Here we report that four 20-mer synthetic peptides (S protein fragments), designed to span these sequence variation hotspots, exhibited significant antiviral activities in a cell line. SARS-CoV infectivity was reduced over 10 000-fold through pre-incubation with two of these peptides, while it was completely inhibited in the presence of three peptides. Molecular modelling of the SARS-CoV peplomer suggests that three of these antiviral peptides map to the interfaces between the three monomers of the trimeric peplomer rather than the heptad repeat region from which short peptides are known to inhibit viral entry. Our results revealed novel regions in the spike protein that can be targeted to inhibit viral infection. The peptides identified in this study could be further developed into antiviral drugs.",M2

Mizoribine and ribavirin selectively inhibited replication of SARS-CoV. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of mizoribine for SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 and SARS-CoV HKU39849, as determined by plaque reduction was 3.5 microg/ml and 16 microg/ml, respectively, and the IC50 of ribavirin for SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 and SARS-CoV HKU39849 was 20 microg/ml and 80 microg/ml, while the 50% cytotoxic concentration of mizoribine and ribavirin for Vero E6 cells exceeded 200 microg/ml. In a yield reduction assay, mizoribine (10 microg/ml) and ribavirin (40 microg/ml) inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and reduced the infectious SARS-CoV titers to one-tenth or less.

Four of these extracts showed moderate to potent antiviral activities against SARS-CoV with 50% effective concentration (EC50) ranging from 2.4 +/- 0.2 to 88.2 +/- 7.7 microg/ml. Out of the four, Lycoris radiata was most potent. To identify the active component, L. radiata extract was subjected to further fractionation, purification, and CPE/MTS assays. This process led to the identification of a single substance lycorine as an anti-SARS-CoV component with an EC50 value of 15.7 +/- 1.2 nM. This compound has a CC50 value of 14980.0 +/- 912.0 nM in cytotoxicity assay and a selective index (SI) greater than 900.

15849181,"Recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus nucleocapsid protein forms a dimer through its C-terminal domain.The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e>, SARS-CoV. The viral nucleocapsid (N) protein plays an essential role in viral RNA packaging. In this study, recombinant SARS-CoV N protein was shown to be dimeric by analytical ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography coupled with light scattering, and chemical cross-linking. Dimeric N proteins self-associate into tetramers and higher molecular weight oligomers at high concentrations. The dimerization domain of N was mapped through studies of the oligomeric states of several truncated mutants. Although mutants consisting of residues 1-210 and 1-284 fold as monomers, constructs consisting of residues 211-422 and 285-422 efficiently form dimers. When in excess, the truncated construct 285-422 inhibits the homodimerization of full-length N protein by forming a heterodimer with the full-length N protein. These results suggest that the N protein oligomerization involves the C-terminal residues 285-422, and this region is a good target for mutagenic studies to disrupt N protein self-association and virion assembly.",M2

Moreover isotope-coded affinity tag technology coupled with two-dimensional LC-MS/MS were also applied to the differential proteins of infected cells. By combining these two complementary strategies, 355 unique proteins were identified and quantitated with 186 of them differentially expressed (at least 1.5-fold quantitative alteration) between infected and uninfected Vero E6 cells. The implication for cellular responses to virus infection was analyzed in depth according to the proteomic results.

15772689,"siRNA targeting the leader sequence of SARS-CoV inhibits virus replication.SARS-CoV (the <e>SARS-Associated Coronavirus</e>) was reported as a novel virus member in the coronavirus family, which was the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Coronavirus replication occurs through a unique mechanism employing Leader sequence in the transcripts when initiating transcription from the genome. Therefore, we cloned the Leader sequence from SARS-CoV(BJ01), which is identical to that identified from SARS-CoV(HKU-39849), and constructed specific siRNA targeting the Leader sequence. Using EGFP and RFP reporter genes fused with the cloned SARS-CoV Leader sequence, we demonstrated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence decreased the mRNA abundance and protein expression levels of the reporter genes in 293T cells. By stably expressing the siRNA in Vero E6 cells, we provided data that the siRNA could effectively and specifically decrease the mRNA abundance of SARS-CoV genes as analyzed by RT-PCR and Northern blot. Our data indicated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells by silencing gene expression. We further demonstrated, via transient transfection experiments, that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence had a much stronger inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV replication than the siRNAs targeting the Spike gene or the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides did. This report provides evidence that targeting Leader sequence using siRNA could be a powerful tool in inhibiting SARS-CoV replication.",M2

Interestingly, two scFvs (B5 and B9) exhibited higher binding specificity to SARS-CoV with the OD(450) value 0.608 and 0.545, respectively, and their coding sequences shared the identical sequence composed of V(H) gene (351bp) and V(L) gene (327bp), so the two scFvs were uniformly named as SA59B and chosen for further analysis. SA59B scFv was expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli HB2151 and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The soluble 30kDa SA59B scFv-antibody was verified in SDS-PAGE and Western-blot. The purified SA59B scFv-antibody was labeled with HRP by the glutaraldehyde method, and the concentration of HRP and SA59B scFv-antibody in the SA59B-HRP solution reached 2.4 and 2.28mg/ml, respectively. Then, the binding ability of SA59B-HRP to SARS-CoV was evaluated by ELISA with S/N of 11.6, indicating higher binding specificity between them.

METHODS: BALB/c mice were immunized with purified N protein of SARS-CoV. Hybridoma cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies against SARS-associated coronavirus nucleocapsid were established after cell fusion with mouse splenic cells and SP2/0 cells. The specificity of the McAbs obtained was examined by Western blot and indirect fluorescence assay. Epitopes reacted with the McAbs were preliminarily located through Western blot by expressing truncated N proteins. RESULTS: After cell fusion and three rounds of cell cloning, six hybridoma cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies specifically against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid were obtained. Western blot and indirect fluorescence assay showed that the McAbs reacted specifically with nucleocapsid protein and SARS-CoV. Among the six McAbs, three recognize the epitopes located in the N-terminus of the protein, whereas the others reacted with those located in the C-terminus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Frankfurt-1 strain of SARS-CoV was incorporated in manufacturing processes of several products by using samples collected immediately before liquid heat treatment at 60 degrees C. RESULTS: SARS-CoV was easily inactivated by this treatment for 60 min in all in-process samples. However, the different composition of the tested samples affected the heat sensitivity of the virus strain: the infectivity of the virus in Antithrombin III preparation still remained after heating for 30 min at 60 degrees C.

15490884,"[Genetic variation analysis of SARS coronavirus]Severe acute respiratory syndrome <e>(SARS)-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) has been verified as the causative agent of a worldwide outbreak of SARS. Since the observed per-base replication error-rate of RNA polymerase is about 3 x 10(-5), RNA virus populations typically contain genetic variants that form a heterogeneous virus pool. This feature confers great adaptability on viruses and is partly responsible for current difficulties of viral disease prevention and control, such as of HIV and HCV infections. SARS-CoV, a newly-identified single-strand RNA virus, has been identified with common variable property of RNA viruses. In this study, genetic variation of SARS-CoV is analyzed based on available documented data and our study. It suggests that SARS-CoV is of similar mutation frequency and dynamic mutant distributions like other RNA viruses, though relatively less identified variation number than those causing chronic infections. In contrast, the viral spike (S) gene exhibits high variation, while nucleocapsid (N) gene shows relative sequence conservation. No obvious correlation is observed between viral variation and clinical disease manifestation from present analyzed data.",M2

ELISA indicated that sera from SARS patients have significant positive reactions with synthesized peptides derived from the 3a protein. These results are concordant with that of a spike protein-derived peptide. A tendency exists for co-mutation between the 3a protein and the spike protein of SARS-CoV isolates, suggesting that the function of the 3a protein correlates with the spike protein.

Here we report that the HIV-1 protease inhibitor, nelfinavir, strongly inhibited replication of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Nelfinavir inhibited the cytopathic effect induced by SARS-CoV infection. Expression of viral antigens was much lower in infected cells treated with nelfinavir than in untreated infected cells. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that nelfinavir could decrease the production of virions from Vero cells. Experiments with various timings of drug addition revealed that nelfinavir exerted its effect not at the entry step, but at the post-entry step of SARS-CoV infection. Our results suggest that nelfinavir should be examined clinically for the treatment of SARS and has potential as a good lead compound for designing anti-SARS drugs.",M2
15030680,"Susceptibility of pigs and chickens to SARS coronavirus.An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans, associated with a new coronavirus, was reported in Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America in early 2003. To address speculations that the virus originated in domesticated animals, or that domestic species were susceptible to the virus, we inoculated 6-week-old pigs and chickens intravenously, intranasally, ocularly, and orally with 106 PFU of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV). Clinical signs did not develop in any animal, nor were gross pathologic changes evident on postmortem examinations. Attempts at virus isolation were unsuccessful; however, viral RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in blood of both species during the first week after inoculation, and in chicken organs at 2 weeks after inoculation. Virus-neutralizing antibodies developed in the pigs. Our results indicate that these animals do not play a role as amplifying hosts for SARS-CoV.",M2
15016646,"Identification of an HLA-A*0201-restricted CD8+ T-cell epitope SSp-1 of SARS-CoV spike protein.A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome <e>(SARS)-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV), has been identified as the causal agent of SARS. Spike (S) protein is a major structural glycoprotein of the SARS virus and a potential target for SARS-specific cell-mediated immune responses. A panel of S protein-derived peptides was tested for their binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules. Peptides with high affinity for HLA-A*0201 were then assessed for their capacity to elicit specific immune responses mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) both in vivo, in HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic mice, and in vitro, from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) harvested from healthy HLA-A2.1(+) donors. SARS-CoV protein-derived peptide-1 (SSp-1 RLNEVAKNL), induced peptide-specific CTLs both in vivo (transgenic mice) and in vitro (human PBLs), which specifically released interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) upon stimulation with SSp-1-pulsed autologous dendritic cells (DCs) or T2 cells. SSp-1-specific CTLs also lysed major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched tumor cell lines engineered to express S proteins. HLA-A*0201-SSp-1 tetramer staining revealed the presence of significant populations of SSp-1-specific CTLs in SSp-1-induced CD8(+) T cells. We propose that the newly identified epitope SSp-1 will help in the characterization of virus control mechanisms and immunopathology in SARS-CoV infection, and may be relevant to the development of immunotherapeutic approaches for SARS.",M2

METHOD: Using primer Premier 5.0 software, two pairs of nested PCR primers were designed to amplify the N gene. After purification, the amplified products were cloned into pMD18-T vectors, and the positive clones with the inserted fragments were identified by sequence analysis. RESULTS: The amplified products was about 1 375 bp in length, and sequence analysis demonstrated that the N gene fragments had been successfully inserted into pMD18-T vectors. CONCLUSION: The successful amplification and cloning of N gene facilitates further investigation of the expression of the N protein and study of its structure and functions.",M2
14579541,"[Genomic variations in the locus for aminopeptidase N:a putative cellular receptor for SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein]Aminopeptidase N has been identified as the cellular receptor for human coronavirus HCoV-229E and was a putative receptor for the spike glycoprotein encoded by the <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV). We report here identification of 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ANPEP, encoding human aminopeptidase N, in Chinese. All ANPEP exons and their flanking intronic sequences were amplified from unrelated normal individuals by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and screened using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Nine SNPs were revealed after direct sequencing of PCR amplified fragments which showed changes of DHPLC chromatogram. Four of these polymorphisms, T321M(962C &gt; T), S651L(1952C &gt; T), S752N(2255G &gt; A) and G764R(2290G &gt; A), were non-synonymous; the remaining exonic synonymous and intronic ones were T795T(2385C &gt; T), IVS7 + 17G &gt; A, IVS14-16A &gt; G, IVS17 + 12C &gt; G and IVS17 + 44C &gt; T. Our data may be useful for studies to investigate the role of host genetic factors in SARS pathogenesis, especially for identifying SARS-susceptible and/or anti-SARS alleles.",M2
14574997,"[Analysis of false-positive associated with antibody tests for SARS-CoV in SLE patients]To discuss the false-positive of serological diagnostic testing for coronavirus antibody in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE), 66 normal individual and 31 SLE with non-SARS patients were detected for <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV) antibody and RNA by enzymelinked immunosorbent assays(ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR). The result showed 2/66 cases(3.0%) were positive of SARS-CoV-IgG antibody and 66 cases were negative of SARS-CoV-IgM antibody in the 66 cases healthy controls; in 31 cases with SLE, positive rates of SARS-CoV-IgG and IgM antibody were 58.1% (18/31) and 29% (9/31), respectively, in which 7 cases(22.6%) were positive of both SARS-CoV-IgG and IgM antibody. All samples of positive SARS-CoV-IgG and IgM antibody were negative by RT-PCR. The ELISA kit coated by non-purification antigen may induce the false-positive of SARS-CoV antibody in patients with SLE. This result suggested that the specificity of ELISA tests for SARS was excellent and has low false-positive rates when using SARS-CoV-IgG and IgM antibody tests. A possible cause of false-positive of SARS-CoV-IgG and IgM antibody in SLE patients is coated antigens with SARS-CoV and Vero-E6 cells in ELISA methods.",M2
14527350,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus genotype and its characterization.OBJECTIVE: To study the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus genotype and its characteristics. METHODS: A <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> isolate named ZJ01 was obtained from throat swab samples taken from a patient in Hangzhou, Zhejing province. The complete genome sequence of ZJ01 consisted of 29,715 bp (GenBank accession: AY297028, version: gi: 30910859). Seventeen SARS-associated coronavirus genome sequences in GenBank were compared to analyze the common sequence variations and the probability of co-occurrence of multiple polymorphisms or mutations. Phylogenetic analysis of those sequences was done. RESULTS: By bioinformatics processing and analysis, the 5 loci nucleotides at ZJ01 genome were found being T, T, G, T and T, respectively. Compared with other SARS-associated coronavirus genomes in the GenBank database, an A/G mutation was detected besides the other 4 mutation loci (C:G:C:C/T:T:T:T) involved in this genetic signature. Therefore a new definition was put forward according to the 5 mutation loci. SARS-associated coronavirus strains would be grouped into two genotypes (C:G:A:C:C/T:T:G:T:T), and abbreviated as SARS coronavirus C genotype and T genotype. On the basis of this new definition, the ZJ01 isolate belongs to SARS-associated coronavirus T genotype, first discovered and reported in mainland China. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein gene fragments of these SARS-associated coronavirus strains showed that the GZ01 isolate was phylogenetically distinct from other isolates, and compared with groups F1 and F2 of the T genotype, the isolates of BJ01 and CUHK-W1 were more closely related to the GZ01 isolate. It was interesting to find that two (A/G and C/T) of the five mutation loci occurred in the spike protein gene, which caused changes of Asp to Gly and Thr to Ile in the protein, respectively. CONCLUSION: Attention should be paid to whether these genotype and mutation patterns are related to the virus's biological activities,epidemic characteristics and host clinical symptoms.",M2
14522185,"<e>SARS associated coronavirus</e> has a recombinant polymerase and coronaviruses have a history of host-shifting.The sudden appearance and potential lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in humans has focused attention on understanding its origins. Here, we assess phylogenetic relationships for the SARS-CoV lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three SARS-CoV proteins: RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Conservation of RDRP allowed us to use a set of Arteriviridae taxa to root the Coronaviridae phylogeny. We found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within SARS-CoV RDRP, based on different, well supported trees for a 5' fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses) and a 3' fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to group three avian coronaviruses). These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5' tree could be rejected for the 3' region, and the optimal 3' tree could be rejected for the 5' region. We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees. Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1-3 and SARS-CoV, based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses. Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously. However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, mammals and manx shearwater, and humans and other mammals. The sister relationship between avian coronaviruses and the 3' RDRP fragment of SARS-CoV suggests an additional host-species shift. Demonstration of recombination in the SARS-CoV lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development.",M2
14499001,"Cloaked similarity between HIV-1 and SARS-CoV suggests an anti-SARS strategy.BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a febrile respiratory illness. The disease has been etiologically linked to a novel coronavirus that has been named the <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> (SARS-CoV), whose genome was recently sequenced. Since it is a member of the Coronaviridae, its spike protein (S2) is believed to play a central role in viral entry by facilitating fusion between the viral and host cell membranes. The protein responsible for viral-induced membrane fusion of HIV-1 (gp41) differs in length, and has no sequence homology with S2. RESULTS: Sequence analysis reveals that the two viral proteins share the sequence motifs that construct their active conformation. These include (1) an N-terminal leucine/isoleucine zipper-like sequence, and (2) a C-terminal heptad repeat located upstream of (3) an aromatic residue-rich region juxtaposed to the (4) transmembrane segment. CONCLUSIONS: This study points to a similar mode of action for the two viral proteins, suggesting that anti-viral strategy that targets the viral-induced membrane fusion step can be adopted from HIV-1 to SARS-CoV. Recently the FDA approved Enfuvirtide, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal heptad repeat of HIV-1 gp41, as an anti-AIDS agent. Enfuvirtide and C34, another anti HIV-1 peptide, exert their inhibitory activity by binding to a leucine/isoleucine zipper-like sequence in gp41, thus inhibiting a conformational change of gp41 required for its activation. We suggest that peptides corresponding to the C-terminal heptad repeat of the S2 protein may serve as inhibitors for SARS-CoV entry.",M2

12865208,"Rapid and efficient preparation of monoclonal antibodies against <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e> nucleocapsid protein by immunizing mice.OBJECTIVE: To develop a rapid and efficient method for preparing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-Cov) nucleocapsid (N) protein. METHODS: BALB/c mice were injected with the recombinant N protein of SARS-Cov into the foot-pads for the immunization, and the popliteal lymph nodes were isolated 15 d later for mAb-producing hybridomas, from which the mAbs against the N protein of SARS-Cov were screened. The identification of the mAb against the N protein of SARS-Cov was performed using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect fluorescent-antibody assay (IFA), and Western immunoblotting. RESULTS: Four strains of hybridomas were obtained that produced the mAb specific to the N protein without detectable cross-reactivity with other pathogens. Of the 4 strains, 2 were identified as the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype, 1 IgG2a, and the other IgG2b, with affinity constants (Ka) of 2 of the strains being 4.14 x 10(-9)M and 3.19 x 10(-9)M respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the preparation of mAb that is specific to the SARS-Cov, and the high-specificity and high-affinity mAb produced by the 4 strains of hybridomas provide a basis for further researches on the pathogenesis and early diagnosis of SARS.",M2
12754118,"[Clinical detection of polymerase gene of <e>SARS-associated coronavirus</e>]OBJECTIVE: To analyze the heterogeneity of polymerase gene fragment of SARS-associated coronavirus from SARS patients, and establish a RT-PCR method for detecting SARS-associated coronavirus. METHODS: RT-PCR was performed using SARS coronavirus-specific primers to amplify the polymerase gene fragment of SARS-associated coronavirus from specimens of suspected and established SARS cases. The amplicons were cloned and sequenced. All the obtained sequences were compared with the sequence of published SARS-associated coronavirus, and alignment was proceeded with other coronavirus sequences. RESULTS: Specific amplicons can be amplified from the sputum samples, throat swab and plasma of most SARS patients, and 8 were random selected and sequenced. All of them possessed 100% homology with the published SARS-associated coronavirus sequence, while all the negative controls were RT-PCR negative. Nucleotide-sequence and amino acid-sequence alignment of the fragment BNI109 with other six known coronavirus show that the fragment BNI109 is more close to bovine coronavirus(BCV) and murine hepatitis virus(MHV). The BNI109 fragment showed 75% homology with BCV and MHV at amino acid level. CONCLUSION: The polymerase fragment BNI109 of SARS coronavirus is highly conservative and is suitable for detecting SARS-associated coronavirus using RT-PCR method.",M2
