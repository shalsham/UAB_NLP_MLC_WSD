14521330,"Synthesis and antiviral activity of some 5'-N-phthaloyl-3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine analogues.A variety of substituted 5'-N-phthaloyl-3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine derivatives has been evaluated for their activity against HIV-1, HIV-2 and Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV) in cell culture. Most of the 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT, zidovudine) derivatives showed antiviral activity in the lower micromolar concentration range and there was a close correlation between their anti-HIV and anti-MSV activity (r = 0.99). The adamantyl phthaloyl derivative was active at submicromolar concentrations. None of the compounds showed marked cytostatic activity. They did not inhibit recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. All compounds were inactive against HIV in thymidine kinase-deficient cells, pointing to the compounds' requirement to release free AZT to afford antiviral efficacy.",M1
12628697,"FTIR microspectroscopy of malignant fibroblasts transformed by mouse sarcoma virus.Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR-MSP), which is based on the characteristic molecular vibrational spectra of cells, was used to investigate spectral differences between normal primary rabbit bone marrow (BM) cells and bone marrow cells transformed (BMT) by <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MuSV). Primary cells, rather than cell lines, were used for this research because primary cells are similar to normal tissue cells in most of their characteristics. Our results showed dramatic changes in absorbance between the control cells and MuSV124-transformed cells. Various biological markers, such as the phosphate level and the RNA/DNA obtained, based on the analysis of the FTIR-MSP spectra, also displayed significant differences between the control and transformed cells. Preliminary results suggested that the cluster analysis performed on the FTIR-MSP spectra yielded 100% accuracy in classifying both types of cells.",M1
11932430,"Functional analysis of the <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> RNA packaging sequence.We investigated the features of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus leader sequence necessary for RNA packaging function by using a deletion analysis approach. We found that sequences that extend beyond those characterized genetically in previous reports are important for optimal packaging efficiency. A fragment covering a minimum of four potential stem-loop structures is required for the shortest packaging element compatible with gene transfer. Our results reveal the extent to which each of the segments of the packaging sequence contribute to packaging efficiency.",M1
10607904,"The induction of skeletal muscle hypertrophy by a ski transgene is promoter-dependent.The chicken c-ski gene expresses at least three alternatively spliced messages. Transgenic mice expressing proteins from cDNA corresponding to two of these messages (FB27 and FB29) under the control of a <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV) long terminal repeat (LTR) express the transgene in skeletal muscle and develop a muscular phenotype. Both a biologically active form of c-ski and the MSV LTR are required for the development of the muscular phenotype. The normal c-ski gene linked to two other tissue-specific promoters failed to induce muscle growth in transgenic mice, as did an inactive mutant of c-ski expressed under the control of the MSV LTR.",M1
10074123,"Detection and induction of equine infectious anemia virus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses by use of recombinant retroviral vectors.Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) appear to be critical in resolving or reducing the severity of lentivirus infections. Retroviral vectors expressing the Gag/Pr or SU protein of the lentivirus equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) were constructed and used to evaluate EIAV-specific CTL responses in horses. Three promoters, cytomegalovirus, simian virus SV40, and Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MoMSV) long terminal repeat (LTR), were used, and there was considerable variation in their ability to direct expression of Gag/Pr and SU. Vectors expressing EIAV proteins under the direction of MoMSV LTR and using the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) Env for internalization were efficient at transducing equine kidney (EK) target cells and were effective targets for EIAV-specific CTL lysis. CTL from EIAV-infected horses caused lysis of retroviral vector-transduced EK cells expressing either Gag/Pr or SU in an ELA-A-restricted manner. In contrast, lysis of recombinant vaccinia virus-infected EK cells expressing Gag/Pr and SU/TM was often non-LA-A restricted. Five horses were immunized by direct intramuscular injection with a mixture of retroviral vectors expressing Gag/Pr or SU, and one responded with EIAV-specific CTL. This result indicates that retroviral vector stimulation of CTL in horses needs to be optimized, perhaps by inclusion of appropriate cytokine genes in the constructs. However, the studies demonstrated that retroviral vector-transduced target cells were very effective for in vitro dissection of EIAV-specific CTL responses.",M1
9766624,"Genetic and immunological parameters governing in vivo susceptibility/resistance to retrovirally induced murine malignant histiocytosis.Malignant histiocytosis sarcoma virus (MHSV) arose as a recombinant of c-Harvey-ras <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (Ha-MuSV) and Friend mink cell focus-forming virus (F-MCFV). It is a defective acute transforming retrovirus that, along with Friend murine leukemia helper virus (F-MuLV), induces malignant histiocytosis (MH) in susceptible adult mice. We have assessed the in vivo susceptibility to MHSV in inbred homozygous, F1 hybrid, congenic, and recombinant inbred (RI) mice. We have shown that: (1) in vivo resistance to MHSV is multigenic, regulated by MHC and non-MHC genes in a different fashion than with F-MCFV, F-MuLV, or Ha-MuSV; (2) using BXD RI mice, the resistance phenotype is linked with 95.8% probability to two linked loci, Pmv-9 and Iapls3-14, on chromosome 13 (homologous to the area of human chromosome 5 for which a chromosomal break point at position 5q35 is associated with human MH); and (3) CD4+ T cells are critical for MHSV resistance.",M1
9169601,"Decreased susceptibility to calpains of v-FosFBR but not of v-FosFBJ or v-JunASV17 retroviral proteins compared with their cellular counterparts.The c-Fos and c-Jun transcription factors are rapidly turned over in vivo. One of the multiple pathways responsible for their breakdown is probably initiated by calpains, which are cytoplasmic calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. The c-fos gene has been transduced by two murine oncogenic retroviruses called Finkel-Biskis-Jenkins <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (FBJ-MSV) and Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine sarcoma virus (FBR-MSV); c-jun has been transduced by the chicken avian sarcoma virus 17 (ASV17) retrovirus. Using an in vitro degradation assay, we show that the mutated v-FosFBR, but not v-FosFBJ or v-JunASV17, is resistant to calpains. This property raises the interesting possibility that decreased sensitivity to calpains might contribute to the tumorigenic potential of FBR-MSV by allowing greater accumulation of the protein that it encodes in infected cells. It has also been demonstrated that resistance to cleavage by calpains does not result from mutations that have accumulated in the Fos moiety of the viral protein but rather from the addition of atypical peptide motifs at its both ends. This observation raises the interesting possibility that homologous regions in viral and cellular Fos either display slightly different conformations or are differentially accessible to interacting proteins.",M1
9056002,"Antiretroviral activities of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates [9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)guanine, (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine, and MDL 74,968] in cell cultures and <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-infected newborn NMRI mice.From a side-by-side comparative study, the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine [(R)-PMPA] and 9-(2-methylidene-3-phosphonomethoxypropyl)guanine (MDL 74,968) proved more selective in their inhibitory effect on human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, feline immunodeficiency virus, and Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV) in cell cultures than the 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) derivatives of adenine (PMEA) and guanine (PMEG). In particular, PMEG proved quite toxic. PMEA, (R)-PMPA, and MDL 74,968 afforded a marked delay in MSV-induced tumor initiation in MSV-infected newborn NMRI mice and substantially delayed associated animal death at doses as low as 4 to 10 mg/kg of body weight. Treatment of the NMRI mice with PMEA, (R)-PMPA, and MDL 74,968 at 25 or 50 mg/kg resulted in a high percentage of long-term survivors.",M1
8896405,"High-dose multidrug resistance in primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells transduced with optimized retroviral vectors.Retroviral transfer of the multidrug-resistance 1 (mdr1) cDNA into primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) of cancer patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy has been proposed to protect the bone marrow from the dose-limiting cytotoxicity of cytostatic agents. Preclinical studies performed with vectors derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) or the related Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> have established that chemoprotection of HPC is feasible. The efficacy of vector-mediated multidrug-resistance under high doses of cytostatic agents, however, remained unclear. We report here that this goal can only be achieved with improved vector design. Novel vectors termed SF-MDR and MP-MDR, which are based on the spleen focus-forming virus or the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus for the enhancer and the murine embryonic stem cell virus for the leader, significantly elevate survival of transduced primary human HPC under moderate doses of colchicine and paclitaxel in vitro when compared with a conventional MoMuLV-based vector. Importantly, SF-MDR and also MP-MDR confer an absolute advantage at high doses of paclitaxel in vitro corresponding to peak plasma levels achieved in patients during chemotherapy. This observation has important consequences for a variety of ongoing and planned gene therapy trials.",M1
8831773,"Acyclic nucleotide analogs derived from 8-azapurines: synthesis and antiviral activity.Reaction of phosphoroorganic synthons with 8-azaadenine, 8-aza-2, 6-diaminopurine, and 8-azaguanine using cesium carbonate yielded regioisomeric 8-azapurine N7-, N8-, and N9-(2-(phosphonomethoxy)alkyl) derivatives. This reaction followed by deprotection afforded isomeric 2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl (PME), (S)-(3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl) [(S)-HPMP], (S)-(3-flouro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl) [(S)-FPMP], (S)-(2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl) [(S)-PMP], and (R)-(2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl) [(R)-PMP] derivatives. 13C NMR spectra were used for structural assignment of the regioisomers. None of the 8-isomers exhibited any antiviral activity against herpesviruses, Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV), and/or HIV. 9-(S)-HPMP-8-azaadenine (23) and PME-8-azaguanine (65) were active against HSV-1, HSV-2, and CMV at 0.2-7 micrograms/mL, VZV at 0.04-0.4 microgram/mL, and MSV (at 0.3-0.6 microgram/mL). PME-8-azaguanine (65) and (R)-PMP-8-azaguanine (71a) protected MT-4 and CEM cells against HIV-1- and HIV-2-induced cytopathicity at a concentration of approximately 2 micrograms/mL.",M1
8755507,"Host range restrictions of oncogenes: myc genes transform avian but not mammalian cells and mht/raf genes transform mammalian but not avian cells.The host range of retroviral oncogenes is naturally limited by the host range of the retroviral vector. The question of whether the transforming host range of retroviral oncogenes is also restricted by the host species has not been directly addressed. Here we have tested in avian and murine host species the transforming host range of two retroviral onc genes, myc of avian carcinoma viruses MH2 and MC29 and mht/raf of avian carcinoma virus MH2 and <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> MSV 3611. Virus vector-mediated host restriction was bypassed by recombining viral oncogenes with retroviral vectors that can readily infect the host to be tested. It was found that, despite high expression, transforming function of retroviral myc genes is restricted to avian cells, and that of retroviral mht/raf genes is restricted to murine cells. Since retroviral oncogenes encode the same proteins as certain cellular genes, termed protooncogenes, our data must also be relevant to the oncogene hypothesis of cancer. According to this hypothesis, cancer is caused by mutation of protooncogenes. Because protooncogenes are conserved in evolution and are presumed to have conserved functions, the oncogene hypothesis assumes no host range restriction of transforming function. For example, mutated human proto-myc is postulated to cause Burkitt lymphoma, because avian retroviruses with myc genes cause cancer in birds. But there is no evidence that known mutated protooncogenes can transform human cells. The findings reported here indicate that host range restriction appears to be one of the reasons (in addition to insufficient transcriptional activation) why known, mutated protooncogenes lack transforming function in human cells.",M1
8621566,"Preferential binding of MyoD-E12 versus myogenin-E12 to the <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> enhancer in vitro.The MyoD family of transcription factors regulates muscle-specific gene expression in vertebrates. In the adult rat, MyoD mRNA accumulates predominately in fast-twitch muscle, in particular type IIb and/or IIx fibers, whereas Myogenin mRNA is restricted to slow-twitch type I muscle fibers. Transgenic mice expressing the avian v-ski oncogene from the murine sarcoma virus (MSV) promoter-enhancer display preferential hypertrophy of type IIb fast-twitch muscle apparently because of the restricted expression of the transgene. We tested the hypothesis that preferential interactions of MyoD, as a heterodimer with E12, with the MSV enhancer, which has six E-box targets for MyoD family proteins, could contribute to v-ski gene expression in IIb muscle fibers. A series of quantitative binding studies was performed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to test MyoD-E12 versus Myogenin-E12 binding to the MSV enhancer. Our results indicate that MyoD-E12 binds the MSV enhancer with higher affinity and higher cooperativity than Myogenin-E12. Interestingly, MyoD-E12 bound all of the individual E-boxes tested with positive cooperativity indicating DNA-mediated dimerization of the protein subunits.",M1
7790318,"Subchromosomal mapping of a putative transformation suppressor gene on human chromosome 1.We previously reported that the introduction of a normal human chromosome 1 via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer suppressed the transformed phenotypes, including anchorage-independent growth, of Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-transformed NIH3T3 (DT) cells. Soft-agar clones derived from DT-#1 cells (DT cells with an intact transferred human chromosome 1) exclusively failed to retain an intact form of this chromosome. Thus, a gene(s) with a suppressive activity on this chromosome had probably been lost. We therefore attempted to identify a commonly deleted region on human chromosome 1 in these soft-agar clones. Although eight of the 9 soft-agar clones examined still contained regions on this chromosome, to a greater or lesser degree, four loci on 1q21 and 1q23-q24 were commonly lost in all of them. Furthermore, the soft-agar clones had growth properties similar to those of DT cells. Thus, chromosome and DNA analyses suggested that human 1q21 and/or 1q23-q24 carries a transformation suppressor gene(s) which controls the transformed phenotypes of DT cells.",M1
7635760,"Enzymatic detection systems for non-isotopic in situ hybridization using biotinylated cDNA probes.The feasibility of various non-isotopic enzymatic detection systems was tested for in situ hybridization using biotin-labelled, nick-translated cDNA probes. For this purpose, we isolated and prepared cDNA restriction fragments encoding the proteolytic cysteine proteinase cathepsin L and analysed Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-transformed BALB/3T3 cells, which have been shown to express high amounts of cytoplasmic RNA of this ras oncogene-induced proteinase. When compared on a semiquantitative basis, colorimetric non-isotopic detection of cDNA hybrids with avidin-biotin-peroxidase conjugates visualized by silver intensification of the nickel-diaminobenzidine end-product was superior to that obtained with avidin-biotin-alkaline phosphatase using different substrates for development. When the peroxidase staining technique was applied for RNA detection, it was found that overnight incubation in methanol containing hydrogen peroxide followed by deproteination with HCl was the most effective method for inhibition of endogenous peroxidase activity. For DNA detection, non-specific nucleic staining was completely abolished when heat treatment (100 degrees C) of the cell specimens was performed prior to hybridization.",M1
7774934,"The mouse Fau gene: genomic structure, chromosomal localization, and characterization of two retropseudogenes.The Fau gene is the cellular homolog of the fox sequence of the Finkel-Biskis-Reilly <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (FBR-MuSV). FBR-MuSV acquired the Fau gene by transduction in a transcriptional orientation opposite to that of the genomic Fau gene. The genomic structure of the mouse Fau gene (MMFAU) and its upstream elements have been determined and are similar to those of the human FAU gene. The gene consists of five exons and is located on chromosome 19. The first exon is not translated. The promoter region has no well-defined TATA box but contains the polypyrimidine initiator flanked by regions of high GC content (65%) and shows all of the characteristics of a housekeeping gene. The 5' end of the mRNA transcript was determined by 5' RACE analysis and is located, as expected, in the polypyrimidine initiator site. Furthermore, the sequences of two retropseudogenes (Fau-ps1 and Fau-ps2) are reported. Both pseudogenes are approximately 75% identical to the Fau cDNA, but both are shorter due to a deletion at the 5' end and do not encode a functional protein. Fau-prs is interrupted by an AG-rich region of about 350 bp within the S30 region of the Fau cDNA. Fau-ps1 was localized on chromosome 1 and Fau-ps2 on chromosome 7.",M1
8046749,"Analytical study of rat retrotransposon VL30 RNA dimerization in vitro and packaging in murine leukemia virus.A sequence of the rat retrotransposon virus-like 30 S RNA (VL30) located next to the 5' end of the Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (HaMSV) genome was recently found to form stable dimeric RNA in vitro and to direct the efficient packaging of VL30-derived recombinant RNAs into MuLV virions. To study the structure-function relationships of the rat VL30 dimerization-encapsidation signal (E/DLS), we have performed biochemical and genetic studies of rat VL30 RNA dimerization in vitro. The results show that temperature and specific cation/RNA interactions are important for VL30 dimerization in vitro. VL30 RNA dimerization is optimal at 55 degrees C and Li+ dramatically enhances the stability of VL30 dimeric RNA. In addition, a genetic analysis of VL30 RNA dimerization reveals that a 5' G-rich sequence is critical for dimer formation and that a UGUCUUGUC repeat contributes to VL30 dimer stability. Interestingly enough, substitution of an A for a G in the 5' G-rich sequence is sufficient to abolish VL30 RNA dimerization in vitro. Taken together, these biochemical and genetic data indicate that dimerization of VL30 RNA involves non-canonical base-pairings and possible purine-purine interactions. Nucleocapsid protein NCp10 of murine leukemia virus (MuLV), a gag-encoded protein that is tightly associated with genomic RNA in the virion core, has been shown to have nucleic acid binding and annealing activities. Here we report that the viral NCp10 protein is able to bind tightly to annealing activities. Here we report that the viral NCp10 protein is able to bind tightly to the retrotransposon VL30 RNA and to activate its dimerization. Moreover, mutations in the 5' G-rich sequence of the VL30 dimerization sequence impaired NCp10 binding to RNA. Recombinant MLV-VL30 vectors with mutations in the VL30 dimerization sequence were constructed. Results obtained in vivo clearly show that the mutations that had a deleterious effect on the packaging of MLV-VL30 retroviral vector in vivo were those that impaired VL30 RNA dimerization and interactions with NCp10 in vitro, even the single mutation in the 5' G-rich region. Therefore, these findings suggest that packaging of VL30 RNA into MuLV virions requires specific interactions between RNA dimerization sequences and viral NC protein molecules.",M1
8395683,"fau cDNA encodes a ubiquitin-like-S30 fusion protein and is expressed as an antisense sequence in the Finkel-Biskis-Reilly <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>.The Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine sarcoma virus (FBR-MuSV) is capable of inducing osteosarcomas in susceptible mice. This retrovirus transduced sequences derived from the transcription factor c-fos and from an unrelated mouse sequence called fox. Here, we describe the cloning and sequence analysis of human and mouse cellular cDNAs hybridizing to the fox sequence. The cloned cDNAs encode for a single ubiquitin-like (Fubi) protein fused in frame to S30, a protein of the small ribosomal subunit. Fubi conserved amino acid residues known to be involved in the ATP-dependent proteolytic activity of ubiquitin. Moreover, the fau gene is conserved in several species, while its mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in different mouse tissues. Surprisingly, FBR-MuSV transduced the complete but mutated open reading frame (ORF) in its reversed transcriptional orientation. This is the first report about a retrovirus in which an antisense sequence to a cellular gene, which we called fau (FBR-MuSV-associated ubiquitously expressed gene), is discovered. Rat-2 cells transfected with plasmids containing v-fau/fox recombinants of FBR-MuSV revealed a twofold increase of the transformation capacity of FBR-MuSV 'in vitro' because of the fau antisense sequence. Newly formed retropseudogenes were identified in three out of eight primary radiation-induced osteosarcomas. This high incidence of creating retropseudogenes in these 90Sr-induced bone tumours may contribute to the mechanism by which FBR-MuSV, originally isolated from such tumours, acquired the fau gene in its reverse orientation.",M1
8395451,"Characterization of a beta-nerve growth factor expression vector for mammalian cells.A mammalian expression vector that directs expression of murine beta-nerve growth factor (beta-NGF) from a <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter element was constructed and characterized. The vector, designated pLTRSNGF, was stably transfected into murine L-cells, and beta-NGF mRNA and protein levels were quantified and compared to endogenous levels in control L-cells. Transfection of pLTRSNGF resulted in an approximate doubling of both beta-NGF mRNA and mature beta-NGF protein secreted into the media. Transfection of pLTRSNGF into rat PC 12 cells resulted in colonies of autocrine-differentiating cells that extended dense networks of neurites in the absence of added NGF, indicating that the beta-NGF produced from the vector is biologically active.",M1
8406491,"Assignment of the human FAU gene to a subregion of chromosome 11q13.The FAU gene is the cellular homologue of the fox sequence in the Finkel-Biskis-Reilly <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (FBR-MuSV). FAU (for FBR-MuSV associated ubiquitously expressed gene) encodes the ribosomal protein S30 fused to a ubiquitin-like protein. A cosmid clone containing the human FAU gene was used for fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes. The obtained localization to 11q13 was confirmed by hybridization against a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing different parts of chromosome 11 on a hamster background. FAU was then further mapped, both on a panel of radiation-reduced somatic cell hybrids designed to carry different parts of the 11q13 region and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. This fine mapping assigned FAU close to the skeletal muscle glycogen phosphorylase gene (PYGM), in a region that contains several oncogenes as well as the putative tumor suppressor genes MEN1 and ST3.",M1
8393045,"A novel enhancer element in the human IL-4 promoter is suppressed by a position-independent silencer.IL-4 is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates T cell-dependent immune responses. We identified and characterized a novel enhancer, positive regulatory element I (PRE-I), in the 5' region of the promoter of the human IL-4 gene. The functional core element of PRE-I is -239GTGTAATTTCCTATGC-224. Two novel nuclear proteins, POS-1 and POS-2, were found to specifically bind to the core element and function as transcriptional activators. The function of PRE-I did not require T cell stimulation and was not restricted to T cells. However, mutations in the core element of PRE-I significantly reduced the promoter activity and completely impaired inducibility of the promoter. In the human IL-4 promoter the enhancer function of PRE-I is strongly suppressed. A negative regulatory element (NRE), 45 bp upstream of PRE-I, directly represses PRE-I enhancer activity. Repression of PRE-I by NRE does not require a particular order or arrangement of positive and negative regulatory sequences. The IL-4 NRE may also down-regulate other enhancers, such as the <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> and the SV40 enhancers. Thus, the IL-4 NRE may represent a new type of cis regulatory element that carries the properties of a silencer but down-regulates enhancer instead of basal promoter activity.",M1
7683275,"Keratin synthesis in SV40-transformed human keratinocytes after transient supertransfection with Harvey murine sarcoma viral DNA.A transformed cell line (HE-IS) was established by transient supertransfection of a SV40-transformed human epidermal cell culture (HE-SL) (R. T. Su and Y.-C. Chang, 1989, Exp. Cell Res. 180, 117-133) with a recombinant plasmid containing an entire Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> DNA. HE-IS cells showed morphological alterations and less stringent growth requirements in a defined medium. A variant line (HE-TC), selected later from the HE-IS cells after a prolonged maintenance in serum-containing Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM), was found to be able to grow in either defined or serum-containing medium. Neither HE-IS nor HE-TC cells were able to form colonies in soft agar or induce tumors in athymic mice when inoculated subcutaneously. When grown in defined medium, all transformed cells (HE-SL, HE-IS, HE-TC) revealed a similar keratin pattern as analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. However, significant reduction of keratins (notably K5) was detected in HE-TC cells maintained in serum-containing DMEM. The keratin pattern appeared to be regulated by the growth environment. Because of their nontumorigenic characteristics and defined growth properties, these transformed keratinocytes are likely to provide a suitable model system for examining the regulation of cytoskeleton protein synthesis.",M1

This virus acquired the fau sequence in its reversed transcriptional orientation. Human and mouse fau cDNA's were identified and both encode a new protein of 133 AA. We show that fau (for FBR-MuSV associated ubiquitiously expressed gene) becomes expressed in all different tissues tested as a 600 bp messenger and we report the genomic structure of the human fau gene. The gene consists of five exons and four introns and the 5' untranslated region displays characteristic features for a housekeeping gene.

1325160,"Expression of gene-specific RNA in cultured cells exposed to rotating 60-Hz magnetic fields.Replicate sets of cultures of mouse and of human cells were exposed to cyclic, sine wave, 60-Hz rotating magnetic fields of 1.0 Gs (1 Gs [symbol: see text] 0.1 mT) for 24-, 48-, or 72-h periods. Total RNA extracted from unexposed control and from magnetic field exposed cells was dot blot hybridized to a number of oncogene probes (including v-myc, v-fos, v-raf, and v-Ha-ras), a probe for 3611 <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>, a probe for the 70,000 dalton heat shock protein (hsp70), and a probe for the long terminal repeat sequence of mouse mammary tumor virus. Comparisons of levels of RNA in unexposed and magnetic field exposed cells measured by densitometer readings of resulting autoradiographs revealed no significant increases or decreases in RNA levels in magnetic field exposed cells with the seven probes tested.",M1
1310154,"Inhibitory effect of myristylation on transrepression by FBR (Gag-Fos) protein.The myristylated v-fos product, FBR <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (Gag-Fos) protein, exhibits a lower level of transrepression of the serum response element (SRE) than does c-fos protein (Fos). Mutation of the N-terminal myristylation site in FBR protein restored SRE transrepression. Replacement of N-terminal viral Gag sequences with the Fos N terminus also restored this activity, providing additional evidence that myristylation inhibits transrepression by FBR protein. However, the myristylated Gag domain did not inhibit SRE transrepression when fused to Fos, indicating that myristylation of a fos protein is not by itself sufficient to prevent SRE transrepression and that C-terminal mutation is necessary to inhibit transrepression by N myristylation. Comparison of transfection results with Fos C-terminal deletion mutants and the Fos/FBR chimeric mutant revealed that the FBR C terminus retained the potential for transrepression despite deletion of the normal Fos C terminus, whereas similar Fos deletion mutants did not. These results indicate that both N- and C-terminal mutations are required to inhibit transrepression by FBR protein and that multiple structural mutations accompanied by posttranslational protein modification alter gene regulation by FBR protein.",M1
1846672,"Myristylation alters DNA-binding activity and transactivation of FBR (gag-fos) protein.FBR <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (gag-fos) protein, a virally transduced Fos protein, exhibits decreased gene transactivation in comparison with the cellular Fos protein. Biochemical analysis suggests that myristylation of the virally encoded N-terminal gag region results in decreased DNA binding and transcriptional activation without affecting heterodimerization with Jun protein. These findings demonstrate that protein myristylation can modulate gene regulation by a DNA-binding protein.",M1
1848987,"Nickel mutagenesis: alteration of the MuSVts110 thermosensitive splicing phenotype by a nickel-induced duplication of the 3' splice site.We investigated DNA damage caused by carcinogenic metals in a <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MuSV)-based mutagenicity assay in which mutations targeted to v-mos expression can be selected. Nickel chloride treatment of NRK cells (termed 6m2 cells) infected with MuSVts110, a retrovirus conditionally defective in viral RNA splicing and cell transformation, caused the outgrowth of transformed  revertants  with changes in the MuSVts110 RNA splicing phenotype. Cadmium and chromium treatment of 6m2 cells resulted in the selection of a second class of revertants with what appeared to be frameshift mutations allowing the translation of a readthrough gag-mos protein. In both classes of metal-induced revertants, viral gene expression was distinct from that observed in revertants arising in untreated 6m2 cultures, arguing that metal treatment did not simply enhance the rate of spontaneous reversion. In one representative nickel revertant line the operative nickel-induced mutation affecting MuSVts110 RNA splicing was a duplication of 70 bases surrounding the 3' splice site. The effect of this mutation was to direct splicing to the most downstream of the duplicated 3' sites and concomitantly relax its characteristic thermosensitivity. These data establish the mutagenic potential of nickel and provide the first example of a defined nickel-induced mutation in a mammalian gene.",M1
1657027,"Long-term explant culture of human colon and a 3-step transformation model for rat colonic epithelium.Our previous studies have suggested that colonic epithelium from rodents pretreated in vivo with suboptimal doses of carcinogen could be more easily maintained in explant culture. Transformation of colonic epithelium from these explants may be induced by subsequent exposure to additional genotropic agents. Therefore, we describe the development of a 3-step transformation model which uses (1) in vivo pretreatment with a suboptimal dose of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) followed by (2) in vitro organ culture and exposure to xenotropic <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (X-MSV), and finally (3) xenograft maintenance in nude mice to allow sufficient time for transformation. Male Wistar rats were injected intramuscularly with 20 mg DMH/kg 10 times per week followed by the removal and explant culture of the colon, which was then treated in vitro with X-MSV, and transplanted into nude mice after 1 week of culture. All the nude mice (n = 6) transplanted with rat colon explants contained viable xenograft explant epithelium and 1 of the 6 showed transformation. Our results demonstrate that the epithelium from animals pretreated with suboptimal doses of carcinogens can be easily transformed. We also demonstrate that human colonic epithelium is viable for an extended period of time in this model. Based on these results, we hypothesize that such a 3-step transformation model is applicable for carcinogenesis studies of various organs from different species, including human if one uses dysplastic or 'pre-neoplastic initiated' tissues obtained at surgery (e.g., ulcerative colitis; Barret's esophagus, etc.).",M1
2172782,"Revertants of v-fos-transformed rat fibroblasts: suppression of transformation is dominant.Phenotypic revertants of Finkel-Biskis-Riley (FBR)-<e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-transformed rat fibroblasts were isolated on the basis of their adherence to plastic tissue culture dishes in the absence of divalent cations. Some revertants had sustained deletions or inactivating mutations of the v-fos gene. However, two revertants expressed a functional v-fos gene at levels equal to that in the transformed parental cells, and therefore phenotypic reversion was due to mutations in nonviral genes. These revertants were considered nontransformed according to four criteria: (i) they were flat and had a nontransformed morphology, (ii) they were contact inhibited when grown to confluence, (iii) they did not display anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and (iv) they did not form tumors in nude mice. Somatic-cell hybrids between the revertants and the transformed parental cells were nontransformed, suggesting that the revertants had sustained an activating mutation of a gene capable of suppressing transformation. The expression of c-jun, junB, and junD was not altered in the revertants, and they could not be transformed by transfection with a c-jun expression vector. The revertants were resistant to transformation by an activated c-Ha-ras gene but were susceptible to transformation by simian virus 40. Our results demonstrate the existence of a class of revertants that harbor genes capable of suppressing transformation by v-fos and some other oncogenes. This contrasts with previously described revertants of transformation by v-fos that contain recessive mutations.",M1
2170671,"Activation of cryptic splice sites in <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-124 mutants.We have examined splice site activation in relation to intron structure in murine sarcoma virus (MuSV)-124 RNA. MuSV-124 contains inactive murine leukemia virus env gene splice sites (termed 5' env and 3' env) as well as cryptic sites in the gag and v-mos genes (termed 5' gag and 3' mos) which are activated for thermosensitive splicing by a 1,487-base intronic deletion in the MuSV-124 derived MuSVts110 retrovirus. To determine conditions permissive for splice site activation, we examined MuSV-124 mutants deleted in the 1,919-base intron bounded by the 5' gag and 3' mos sites. Several of these deletions activated thermosensitive splicing either at the same sites used in MuSVts110 or in a previously unreported temperature-sensitive splice event between the 5' gag and 3' env sites. These data suggested that the thermosensitive splicing phenotype characteristic of MuSVts110 required neither a specialized intron nor selection of a particular 3' splice site. The 3' env and 3' mos sites were found to compete for splicing to the 5' gag site; the more upstream 3' env site was exclusively used in MuSV-124 mutants containing both sites, whereas selection of the 3' mos site required removal of the 3' env site. Branchpoint sequences were found to have a potential regulatory role in thermosensitive splicing. Insertion of a beta-globin branchpoint sequence in a splicing-inactive MuSV-124 mutant activated efficient nonthermosensitive splicing at the 3' mos site, whereas a mutated branchpoint activated less efficient but thermosensitive splicing.",M1
2163749,"Adhesion of Kirsten-ras+ tumor-progressing and Kirsten-ras- revertant 3T3 cells on fibronectin proteolytic fragments.Adhesion has been evaluated for tumor cell populations derived from Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (KiMSV)-transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells responding to substrata coated with intact plasma fibronectin (pFN), a family of related proteolytic fragments from pFN or cellular fibronectins (FNs), and the heparan sulfate-binding platelet factor-4 (PF4). Both early-passage KiMSV cells, harboring the viral Kirsten ras oncogene (v-Ki-ras+), and late-passage KiMSV cells, in which most cells have lost the oncogene (v-Ki-ras-), are compared with primary tumor and lung metastatic tumor cells after three routes of injection into nude mice; nontumorigenic v-Ki-ras- revertant cells have been cloned from the late-passage KiMSV population. Attachment of early-passage KiMSV, primary tumor, and lung metastatic tumor cells was optimal and resistant to soluble RGDS peptide in the medium on intact pFN, on fragment F-155 from pFN containing the RGDS cell-binding domain and the heparinII domain, and on PF4 but decreased for metastatic cells on F110 containing only the RGDS domain (and sensitive to RGDS peptide). Cytoplasmic spreading of early-passage KiMSV and all tumor cells was good to excellent in polygonal patterns on pFN and on F155, while most cells remained round on F110. Responses for KiMSV and tumor cells varied on different heparin-binding proteins; cells remained rounded or detached on F38 derived from pFN or on PF4 but spread effectively with long linear process extension on cellular FN-derived fragments F44 + 47 harboring the extra domaina sequence. That F44 + 47 may contain a new cell-binding site for v-Ki-ras+ cells was also indicated by resistance to bacterial heparitanase in cell responses on F44 + 47 but not on PF4 and extensive catabolism of proteoglycans in the substratum-attached material of these cells. v-Ki-ras- revertant cells, nontumorigenic in nude mice, have reacquired 3T3-like responses to proteolytic fragments, including much more effective spreading on PF4 or on F38 substrata, and have reverted in generating microfilament stress fibers on pFN, a competence lacking in all v-Ki-ras+ cells. These results indicate that (a) v-Ki-ras+ primary and metastatic tumor cells respond similarly to most proteolytic fragments of FNs harboring known binding domains, with a few exceptions; (b) v-Ki-ras gene expression correlates with a new cell surface receptor activity recognized by extra domaina-containing fragments from cellular FNs; and (c) loss of the viral oncogene to generate v-Ki-ras- revertant cells reverts their FN-mediated adhesion responses.",M1
2158405,"Altered glycosylation in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells after transformation by <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>.The changes in glycosylation of an immortalized epithelial cell line (MDCK) before and after progression towards a more malignant phenotype have been studied. The parental MDCK-3 cells were immortalized after long-term passage in vitro and have shown no tendency for spontaneous acquisition of malignancy-related phenotypes such as tumorigenicity, invasion and metastasis. They conserved morphological and functional characteristics of the epithelial tissue of origin. The ras-MDCK cells acquired the fully malignant phenotype after transformation with a Harvey murine sarcoma virus; they were immortalized, invasive in vitro and produced invasive and also metastatic tumors after subcutaneous injection into nude mice. Using immobilized lectins and gel chromatography, before and after liberation of O-linked glycans from the peptide moieties and also after removal of terminal sialic acid, we have found differences in the glycosylpeptides of both whole cells and cell surface trypsinates from ras-MDCK cultures as compared to the parental MDCK-3 cultures: (i) more sialic acid in the N-linked tri- and tetra-antennary structures; (ii) more fucosylation in the N-glycosylpeptides; (iii) more bi-antennary N-glycosylpeptides and less O-linked glycans; and (iv) a lower molecular weight of the O-linked glycans probably due to a decreased sialylation. It is concluded that alterations in sialylation and fucosylation of the cell surface exposed glycans accompanied progression of MDCK-3 cells towards a more malignant phenotype.",M1
1690732,"Alkalinization of the lysosomes is correlated with ras transformation of murine and human fibroblasts.The pH of the intralysosomal compartment of fibroblasts in culture was monitored by measuring the fluorescence emission intensity at 530 nm of fluid phase pinocytosed fluorescein-conjugated dextrans (FITC-dextrans) excited at 488 and 457 nm. Following the procedure of Ohkuma and Poole (Ohkuma, S., and Poole, B. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. (1978) 75, 3327-3331), a relationship was established between the fluorescence emission intensity of the FITC-dextrans and pH. This correlation was used to determine the intralysosomal apparent pH (pHapp) of a series of fibroblast cultures. The mean intralysosomal pHapp values of nontransformed mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and an infinite life-span human fibroblast cell strain, designated MSU-1.1, was 5.0. In distinction that of 3T3 fibroblasts transformed to the malignant state by Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> and MSU-1.1 cells transformed by transfection of the v-Ki-ras or T24 H-ras oncogene was 6.1. These measurements suggest that ras transformation results in a significant perturbation of lysosomal pH.",M1
1968408,"Retroviral transfer of a chimeric multidrug resistance-adenosine deaminase gene.A fusion between a selectable multidrug resistance (MDR1) cDNA and an adenosine deaminase (ADA) cDNA concomitantly confers multidrug resistance and ADA activity on transfected cells. We have produced a Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-derived, replication-defective, recombinant retrovirus to transduce this chimeric MDR-ADA gene efficiently into a great variety of cells. Infection with the MDR-ADA retrovirus conferred the multidrug resistance phenotype on drug-sensitive cells, therefore allowing selection in the presence of colchicine. Colchicine-resistant cells synthesized large amounts of a membrane-associated 210-kDa MDR-ADA fusion protein that preserved both MDR and ADA functional activities. To monitor expression of the chimeric gene in vivo, Kirsten virus-transformed NIH cells were infected with the MDR-ADA retrovirus, and after drug-selection, injected into athymic nude mice. Tumors developed that contained the bifunctionally active MDR-ADA fusion protein. When these mouse tumor cells were placed in tissue culture without the selecting drug, they did not lose the bifunctionally active MDR-ADA fusion protein. The replication-defective, recombinant MDR-ADA retrovirus should be useful to stably introduce the chimeric MDR-ADA gene into a variety of cell types for biological experiments in vitro and in vivo.",M1
1690424,"Retroviral recombination during reverse transcription.After mixed infection, up to half of related retroviruses are recombinants. During infection, retroviral RNA genomes are first converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) and then to double-stranded DNA. Thus recombination could occur during reverse transcription, by RNA template switching, or after reverse transcription, by breakage and reunion of DNA. It has not been possible to distinguish between these two potential mechanisms of recombination because both single-stranded cDNA and double-stranded proviral DNA exist in infected cells during the eclipse period. Therefore we have analyzed for recombinant molecules among cDNA products transcribed in vitro from RNA of disrupted virions. Since recombinants from allelic parents can only be distinguished from parental genomes by point mutations, we have examined the cDNAs from virions with distinct genetic structures for recombinant-specific size and sequence markers. The parents share a common internal allele that allows homology-directed recombination, but each contains specific flanking sequences. One parent is a synthetically altered Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> RNA that lacks a retroviral 3' terminus but carries a Moloney murine retrovirus-derived envelope gene (env) fragment 3' of its transforming ras gene. The other parent is intact Moloney virus. Using a Harvey-specific 5' primer and a Moloney-specific 3' primer, we have found recombinant cDNAs with the polymerase chain reaction, proving directly that retroviruses can recombine during reverse transcription unassisted by cellular enzymes, probably by template switching during cDNA synthesis. The recombinants that were obtained in vitro were identical with those obtained in parallel experiments in vivo.",M1
2157456,"Isolation and characterization of Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-transformed mouse keratinocytes resistant to transforming growth factor beta.BALB/MK (MK) is a continuous murine keratinocyte line whose cells are strictly dependent on exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) for growth in culture. A derivative cell, KC, resulted from Kirsten murine sarcoma virus transformation, and these cells no longer require EGF for their growth. Despite differences in MK and KC growth conditions, both cell lines are growth inhibited by picomolar concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). When MK and KC cells were maintained in the presence of TGF-beta, resistant variants eventually proliferated only from the KC population. In an attempt to determine the mechanism of development of TGF-beta resistance, the TGF-beta-resistant cells (KCR cells) were compared with TGF-beta-sensitive KC cells with regard to growth properties, TGF-beta 1 binding characteristics, and gene expression. KCR cells continued to synthesize DNA and proliferated in the presence of TGF-beta 1 concentrations up to 2 nM, which was 500-fold greater than the ED50 for the sensitive cells. Although the KCR cells possess similar receptor numbers and affinity for TGF-beta 1, we observed differences in affinity cross-linking studies. The KCR cells expressed more of the type III, high molecular weight cell surface binding protein and less of the type II than the KC cells. The type I moiety was clearly altered to a smaller size in some, but not all, KCR cells. In gene regulation studies, there was no apparent difference in c-Ki-ras and v-Ki-ras mRNA levels in the KC and KCR cells. Additionally, expression of TGF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 mRNA was similar in MK, KC, and KCR cells. The expression of proliferation-associated genes, such as c-myc and MGSA/c-gro/kc, which were markedly decreased by TGF-beta 1 in the MK and KC cells, was not altered by TGF-beta 1 in the KCR cells. The data suggest that the loss of TGF-beta 1 responsiveness in the KCR cells was due to an alteration in the TGF-beta receptor that did not permit signal transduction, although the existence of postreceptor alterations cannot be excluded.",M1
2152823,"The malignant histiocytosis sarcoma virus, a recombinant of Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> and Friend mink cell focus-forming virus, has acquired myeloid transformation specificity by alterations in the long terminal repeat.The malignant histiocytosis sarcoma virus (MHSV), in contrast to other viruses with the ras oncogene, induces acute histiocytosis in newborn and adult mice. Molecular structure and function studies were initiated to determine the basis of its unique macrophage-transforming potential. Characterization of the genomic structure showed that the virus evolved by recombination of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MuSV) and a virus of the Friend-mink cell focus-forming virus family. Structural analysis of MHSV showed two regions of the genome that are basically different from the Ha-MuSV: (i) the ras gene, which is altered by a point mutation in codon 181 leading to a Cys----Ser substitution of the p21 protein, and (ii) the U3 region of the long terminal repeat, which is largely derived from F-MCFV and contains a deletion of one direct repeat as well as a duplication of an altered enhancer-like region. Biological studies of Ha-MuSV, MHSV, and recombinants between the two viruses show that the U3 region of the MHSV long terminal repeat is essential for the malignancy and specificity of the disease. A contributing role of the ras point mutation in determining macrophage specificity, however, cannot be excluded.",M1
2553014,"High level expression of p55, a thyroid hormone binding protein which is homologous to protein disulfide isomerase in a retroviral vector.To develop an efficient system for a high level expression of a human cellular thyroid hormone binding protein (p55) in eukaryotic cells, a full-length p55 cDNA was inserted into a Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-derived vector (pHTBr) and transfected into mouse NIH 3T3 cells. The expressed p55 has a molecular weight of 55,000 and is recognized by the human specific anti-p55 monoclonal antibody. Similar to the endogenous p55, the expressed p55 is localized on endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Moreover, p55 was specifically labeled by N-bromoacetyl-3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine. Thus, the expressed p55 is structurally indistinguishable from the endogeneous p55. pHTBr was packaged into a virus with the aide of an amphotropic virus. Infection by pHTBr-containing virus yielded a 2-11 fold higher expression than the endogeneous p55 in NIH3T3, rat GH3, human HepG2 cells and a mouse monoclonal antibody secreting hybridoma.",M1
2477166,"5-Azacytidine-induced recovery of O6-alkylguanine--DNA alkyltransferase activity in mouse Ha821 cells.Mouse Ha821 cells, Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-transformed NIH3T3 cells, have extremely low O6-alkylguanine--DNA alkyltransferase (O6AGTase) activity and are hypersensitive to an anti-tumor chloroethylating agent 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl) methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea hydrochloride (ACNU). The treatment of Ha821 cells with a DNA demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine, resulted in an increase in the frequency of ACNU-resistant cell clones. All randomly isolated ACNU-resistant cell clones were found to have O6AGTase activity comparable to the level of the parental NIH3T3 cells. These results suggest that reversible loss of O6AGTase activity in Ha821 cells is caused at least in part by inactivation of the O6AGTase gene due to methylation of cytosine in the gene.",M1
2548008,"Oncogenicity of human N-ras oncogene and proto-oncogene introduced into retroviral vectors.The N-ras gene is the only member of the ras family which has never been naturally transduced into a retrovirus. In order to study the in vitro and in vivo oncogenicity of N-ras and to compare its pathogenicity to that of H-ras, we have inserted an activated or a normal form of human N-ras cDNA into a slightly modified Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-derived vector in which the H-ras p21 coding region had been deleted. The resulting constructions were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. The activated N-ras-containing construct (HSN) induced 10(4) foci per microgram of DNA and was found to be as transforming as H-ras was. After infection of the transfected cells by either the ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus or the amphotropic 4070A helper viruses, rescued transforming viruses were injected into newborn mice. Both pseudotypes of HSN virus containing activated N-ras induced the typical Harvey disease with similar latency. However, we found that the virus which contained normal N-ras p21 (HSn) was also pathogenic and induced splenomegaly, lymphadenopathies, and sarcoma in mice after a latency of 3 to 7 weeks. In addition, Moloney murine leukemia virus pseudotypes of N-ras caused neurological disorders in 30% of the infected animals. These results differed markedly from those of previous experiments in which we had inserted the activated form of N-ras in the pSV(X) vector: the resulting SVN-ras virus was transforming on NIH 3T3 cells but was poorly oncogenic in vivo (M. Souyri, C. F. Koehne, P. V. O'Donnel, T. H. Aldrich, M. E. Furth, and E. Fleissner, Virology 158:69-78). However, similarly poor oncogenicity was also observed when the v-H-ras coding sequence was inserted in pSV(X) vector, which indicated that the vector sequences play a crucial role in the pathogenicity of a given oncogene. Altogether, these data demonstrated unequivocally that N-ras is potentially as oncogenic as H-ras and that such oncogenic effect could depend on the vector environment.",M1
2544514,"Regulation of IFN-gamma-induced host cell MHC antigen expression by Kirsten MSV and MLV. II. Effects on class II antigen expression.We have reported previously that the Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (Ki-MSV), which carries the v-Ki-ras oncogene, prevents the induction of the class II MHC antigen H-2A and reduces the induction of class I MHC antigens by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on C3H10T 1/2 fibroblasts. It is here shown that the abolition by the virus of H-2A expression extends also to class II antigen H-2E and that this is maintained for at least 7 days after IFN treatment. In addition no concentration of IFN-gamma tested, including supra-optimal concentrations for class I antigen expression, induced class II antigens on MSV-infected cells. Thus MSV inhibits the induction by IFN-gamma of class II MHC antigens by a mechanism other than via a change in kinetics of response to, or in the sensitivity of the cells to, IFN. The possibility that transformation by MSV could result in the (selective) outgrowth of cells unresponsive to IFN was refuted by the observation that clones of C3H10T 1/2, when infected with Ki-MSV, expressed no or dramatically reduced levels of H-2A or H-2E. One C3H10T 1/2 clone chosen for high class II expression, when transformed with Ki-MSV, did express low levels of class II antigens at optimal concentrations of IFN-gamma, suggesting that the degree of the reduction of class II expression varies with the cells that are infected. Comparison with mechanisms whereby other viruses inhibit MHC antigen display revealed an interesting possibility: IFN response sequences (IRS) identified in the virus genomes might act in trans to (down) regulate MHC antigen expression. This could be an important mechanism determining the tumourigenicity of, and immune evasion by, Ki-MSV and other viruses.",M1
2544513,"Regulation of IFN-gamma-induced host cell MHC antigen expression by Kirsten MSV and MLV. I. Effects on class I antigen expression.We have reported previously that the Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (Ki-MSV) that carries the v-Ki-ras oncogene prevents C3H10T 1/2 fibroblasts from being able to respond to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) with the expression of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen, H-2A. In this report we investigate further as to whether MSV or its parent virus Kirsten murine leukaemia virus (Ki-MLV) is able to reduce host class I MHC antigen expression. The results demonstrate that class I expression is diminished in MSV-infected cells over a time-course of 7 days after exposure to IFN-gamma and over a range of IFN-gamma concentrations. The optimal concentration of IFN-gamma for maximal class I expression remained unchanged. Cells infected with Ki-MLV, which failed to abolish the induction by IFN-gamma of class II antigens, also expressed lower levels of class I antigens, similar to those for cells infected with Ki-MSV, after exposure to IFN-gamma. It is likely therefore that the inhibition of class I induction is due to genetic material shared between the viruses, principally in the long terminal repeats (LTR), and hence that the mechanism of action is distinct from that responsible for the abolition of class II induction by Ki-MSV alone. Since class I antigens are required for CD8+ T cells (mainly cytotoxic T cells) to recognize (foreign) antigen this reduction in class I expression might lead to reduced visibility of infected cells to T cells and thus might contribute to the tumorigenicity of Ki-MSV-infected cells.",M1
2539371,"Differential patterns of intracellular metabolism of 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine and 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine, two potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus compounds.3'-Azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (D4T) are potent and selective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus replication in MT-4 and ATH8 cells. They are also inhibitory to the replication of murine retroviruses, i.e. Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-induced transformation of C3H cells. In MT-4 cells AZT is readily phosphorylated to its 5'-monophosphate, while the 5'-di- and 5'-triphosphates are generated to a 200-600-fold lower extent than the 5'-monophosphate. D4T is phosphorylated in MT-4 cells to its 5'-monophosphate at a 300-600-fold lower extent than AZT. The phosphorylation of AZT in the thymidine kinase-deficient cell line (Raji/TK-) is severely depressed, while D4T phosphorylation is only slightly diminished in Raji/TK- as compared to Raji/0 cells. D4T has a 10-fold lower affinity for phosphorylation by crude MT-4 cell extracts than AZT (Km, 142 and 14 microM, respectively), and the Vmax for phosphorylation of D4T is only 5% that of AZT. D4T is phosphorylated by MT-4 cell extracts about 180-fold less efficiently than AZT (Vmax/Km, 0.06 for D4T, as compared to 11 for AZT), and this is consistent with the differences found in the amounts of phosphorylated products of D4T and AZT formed in intact MT-4 cells. The 5'-triphosphates of AZT and D4T are equipotent in their inhibitory effects on the reverse transcriptases from human immunodeficiency virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus.",M1
2536840,"Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>: influences of coding and noncoding sequences on cell transformation in vitro and oncogenicity in vivo.The rat-derived Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MuSV) contains a transduced ras oncogene activated by two missense mutations and flanked by rat retroviruslike VL30 sequences. Ha-MuSV induces focal transformation of mouse NIH 3T3 cells in vitro and tumors (fibrosarcomas and splenic erythroleukemias) in newborn mice. We have used these two assays to study the contribution of coding and noncoding viral sequences to the biological activity of Ha-MuSV. A good correlation was found between the in vitro and in vivo assays. In several different isogenic Ha-MuSV variants, those with a rasH gene that had one or both of the Ha-MuSV missense mutations were much more active biologically than the corresponding proto-oncogene. A Ha-MuSV variant that encoded the proto-oncogene protein induced lymphoid leukemias (with thymomas), with a relatively long latent period, rather than the fibrosarcomas and erythroleukemias characteristic of Ha-MuSV with one or both missense mutations. A VL30-derived segment with enhancer activity was identified downstream from v-rasH. A mutant Ha-MuSV from which this 3' noncoding segment was deleted expressed lower levels of the wild-type viral protein, displayed impaired transforming activity in vitro, and induced lymphoid leukemias (with thymomas). 5' noncoding rat c-rasH sequences were found to increase the biological activity of the virus when substituted for the corresponding segment of v-rasH. We conclude that (i) the biological activity of Ha-MuSV can be influence significantly by noncoding sequences located outside the long terminal repeat as well as by coding sequences, (ii) VL30 sequences positively regulate the expression of v-rasH, (iii) relatively low biological levels of ras, whether resulting from low-level expression of wild type v-rasH or high-levels of ras proto-oncogene protein, induce a type of tumor that differs from tumors induced by high biological levels of ras, and (iv) the in vivo pathogenicity of the Ha-MuSV variants correlated with their transforming activity on NIH 3T3 cells.",M1
2536824,"2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase gene expression in normal and <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-transformed NIH 3T3 cells.Mouse fibroblasts transformed by murine sarcoma virus (MSV) are highly sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of interferon (IFN) (M. Bakhanashvili, D. H. Wreschner, and S. Salzberg, Cancer Res. 43:1289-1294, 1983). To elucidate the mechanism leading to this IFN sensitivity, the expression of the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5A synthetase) gene, the presence of the 2-5A synthetase protein, and the level of its enzymatic activity were determined in IFN-treated and untreated cultures. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were compared with two different NIH 3T3 clones transformed by MSV. Cultures were treated with 300 IU of beta IFN (IFN-beta) per ml for 16 to 24 h. While no detectable 2-5A synthetase-derived transcripts were seen in untreated NIH 3T3 cells, two size classes of RNA transcripts, i.e., 1.7 and 4.2 kilobases, were detected in IFN-treated cultures. Surprisingly, a similar amount of transcripts were present in untreated transformed cells. However, following IFN treatment, an eightfold increase in the level of RNA was readily detected in these cells, with no change in the size classes. Similar results were obtained with the 2-5A synthetase protein, for which three size classes of 42, 71, and 102 kilodaltons were demonstrated by immunoblotting, and with the enzymatic activity, for which again, the highest level was seen in IFN-treated MSV-transformed cultures. The basal level of 2-5A synthetase gene expression in the transformed cells has biological significance since these cells were more resistant to mengovirus infection than NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Medium collected from transformed cultures failed to induce 2-5A synthetase activity in NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, antibodies directed against mouse IFN-beta failed to inhibit 2-5A synthetase activity detected in transformed cultures. These results suggest that at least IFN-beta secretion is not involved in the elevated level of 2-5A synthetase gene expression in these cells.",M1
2468124,"Alteration of growth and differentiation factors response by Kirsten and Harvey sarcoma viruses in the IL-3-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line 32D C13(G).32D C13(G) is an interleukin 3(IL3)-dependent non-tumorigenic murine hematopoietic cell line which undergoes terminal differentiation into granulocytes when exposed to granulocytic colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Infections of 32D C13(G) cells with either Kirsten rat sarcoma virus or Balb <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>, both containing a v-ras oncogene, generates clones that can permanently grow in G-CSF without differentiation. 32D-Ki-ras cells show a heterogeneous morphology ranging from the promyelocytic to the myelocytic stage of differentiation, and express high levels of both myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoferrin (LF) mRNA. 32D-Ha-ras cells show a more immature phenotype and express MPO but no LF mRNA. The apparent differentiation block of both 32D Ki-ras and 32D Ha ras can be reversed by treatment with the chemical inducers retinoic acid, sodium butyrate or dimethylsulphoxide, which leads to terminal differentiation into granulocytes. When 32D-Ki-ras and 32D-Ha-ras cells are cultured in medium containing IL-3 they become adherent and express some monocyte-macrophage markers. Upon prolonged exposure to IL3, 32D-Ki-ras, but not 32D-Ha-ras, resume suspension growth. Both 32D-Ki-ras and 32D-Ha-ras rapidly die if grown in chemically defined medium in the absence of any growth factor and are non-tumorigenic in immunosuppressed mice. These findings indicate that ras activation may interfere with the normal response to growth and differentiation factors in cells of the granulocytic lineage. These alterations may represent a critical, although non-sufficient, step in leukemogenesis.",M1
2538791,"The Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> induces rat thyroid carcinomas in vivo.The injection of a retrovirus carrying the v-ras-Ki oncogene into the thyroid gland of adult Fischer rats induces thyroid carcinomas when associated with a treatment of the animals with a goitrogenic agent. More than one hundred adult Fischer rats have been treated with the goitrogen agent propylthiouracil in order to induce thyroid hyperplasia. Twenty days after treatment, rat thyroid glands, surgically prepared, were injected with the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (KiMSV). Within three months more than 90% of the animals developed thyroid tumors. Histologically the tumors had the appearance of well differentiated carcinomas. Thirty animals had lung metastases in addition to the thyroid carcinoma. The presence of KiMSV specific transcripts and the specific transforming protein (p21) in thyroid carcinomas and in the metastases was detected by Northern blot analysis and immunoprecipitation, respectively. Only three rats, among thirty that had not received the goitrogen treatment, but only the injection with KiMSV, developed thyroid carcinomas of very small size and with a very long latency period (almost one year). The results described represent the first instance of thyroid carcinoma induction by retroviruses. This system may be regarded as a useful model to investigate the process of thyroid carcinogenesis in vivo. These results suggest that this model may also be useful for investigating the interaction between hormones and cells harboring the activated oncogene in the development of thyroid carcinoma since activated ras oncogenes have been implicated in human thyroid carcinoma.",M1

2844835,"Cytoarchitecture of Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed rat kidney fibroblasts: butyrate-induced reorganization within the actin microfilament network.<e>Murine sarcoma virus</e>-transformed rat fibroblasts (KNRK cells) undergo marked cytoarchitectural reorganization during in vitro exposure to sodium-n-butyrate (NaB) resulting in restoration of (1) a more typical fibroblastoid morphology, (2) proper cell-to-cell orientation, and (3) substratum adherence. Augmented cell spreading, involving greater than 90% of the population, was a function of culture density and time of exposure to NaB (2 mM final concentration). Induced cell spreading reflected a 2.5- to 3.0-fold increase in both total cellular actin content and deposition of actin into the detergent-resistant cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal actin deposition in response to NaB was accompanied by the formation of occasionally dense, parallel alignments of F-actin-containing microfilaments and by a dramatic increase in the size and incidence of actin-enriched membrane ruffles. Long-term NaB-treated cells exhibited parallel orientations of microfilaments similar to those found in untransformed fibroblasts. Increased cytoskeletal actin occurred within 24 hr of NaB exposure, correlating with the initial reorganization of actin-containing microfilaments detected microscopically, and reflected concomitant 3-fold increases in cellular alpha-actinin and fibronectin content. In contrast, the amount of vimentin, tropomyosin, and tubulin in NaB-treated cells was significantly decreased. NaB-induced morphologic restructuring of sarcoma virus-transformed fibroblasts, thus, impacts on all three basic cytoskeletal systems. Selective increases, however, were evident in particular cytoskeletal proteins (actin, alpha-actinin, fibronectin) implicated in microfilament networking and cell spreading.",M1
2457591,"Immortalization of murine connective tissue-type mast cells at multiple stages of their differentiation by coculture of splenocytes with fibroblasts that produce Kirsten sarcoma virus.Mature connective tissue mast cells (CTMC) have not been previously available as a cell line from any species. Here we describe 15 novel mast cell lines (KiSV-MC) that were derived by coculturing murine splenocytes with fibroblasts that produce a Ki-ras-containing <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>. Some of the KiSV-MC lines are similar to CTMC in that they synthesize predominantly heparin proteoglycans, and contain up to 35 micrograms of histamine and 2.2 units of carboxypeptidase A/10(6) cells in secretory granules which stain red with Safranin. Other cell lines display phenotypic characteristics intermediate to CTMC and mucosal-like mast cells in being predominantly Safranin-, having lower amounts of histamine and carboxypeptidase A, and in synthesizing chondroitin sulfate E proteoglycans in preference to heparin proteoglycans. When the individual KiSV-MC lines were compared, a linear relationship was found between the number of Safranin+ granules, the cellular contents of histamine and carboxypeptidase A, and the biosynthesis of heparin relative to chondroitin sulfate E proteoglycans. Upon sensitization with monoclonal IgE and exposure to hapten-specific antigen, the cells exocytose the contents of their secretory granules. Thus, these immortalized cells provide the first source of CTMC-like lines for chemical and functional analysis and illustrate that murine mast cells can express a continuum of phenotypes.",M1
2841504,"Harvey sarcoma virus genome contains no extensive sequences unrelated to those of other retroviruses except ras.The Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> genome contains two rat-derived sets of genetic information recombined with the Moloney mouse leukemia virus. The rat sequences represent a ras oncogene and a rat VL30 element. The VL30 sequences have several discrete regions of similarity with retroviral sequences which were detected by searching a protein database for similarities with predicted polypeptide sequences from the VL30 regions. On the 5' side, the most similar sequences were those of feline sarcoma viruses; on the 3' side, murine leukemia viruses were the most similar. Some of the regions of similarity could also be detected directly by searching a nucleic acid sequence database with the viral DNA sequences. The most extensive region of similarity was that which corresponded to the endonuclease in the pol gene of a murine leukemia virus. The majority of the rat-derived sequences present in the Harvey sarcoma virus genome can now be attributed exclusively to ras or retrovirus- or retrotransposon-related sequences.",M1

In terms of anti-HIV potency in MT-4 cells, the PME 2,6-diaminopurine derivative (50% effective dose [ED50], 1 microM) ranked first, followed by the PME adenine derivative (ED50, 2 microM [MT-4]) and the PME 2-monoaminopurine derivative (ED50, 45 microM). Antiretroviral activity was also demonstrated in ATH8 and H9 cells, which were de novo infected with HIV, and extended to C3H mouse fibroblasts infected with Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>.

2840442,"Bifunctional activity of transforming growth factor type beta on the growth of NRK-49F cells, normal and transformed by Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>.Transformation of rat NRK-49F cells (49F) by Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (Ki-MSV) renders these cells (Ki-49F cells) capable of autonomous anchorage independent (AI) growth. As compared to nontransformed 49F cells, the transformation by Ki-MSV does not modify the cell response to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in monolayer conditions, but alters it in A I growth conditions. The growth of nontransformed or Ki-MSV-transformed adherent 49F cells is slowed down by porcine TGF-beta, and this effect is reversed by epidermal growth factor (EGF). This decrease in the cell growth rate, induced by TGF-beta, does not affect the cloning efficiency of untransformed and transformed adherent 49F cells. Contrarily, porcine TGF-beta decreases the A I cloning efficiency of Ki-49F cells in agar-gelled medium; this effect is only partly reversed by EGF, which does not synergise with TGF-beta to enhance the A I growth as in the case of untransformed 49F cells. Media conditioned by 49F cells, Ki-49F cells, and chicken embryo fibroblasts contain a latent TGF-beta whose capacity to promote the A I growth of 49F cells and to inhibit that of Ki-49F cells is unmasked by acidification. The same situation exists concerning TGF-beta from human platelets. Neutral extracts are inefficient in both tests of promotion and inhibition of A I growth and contain an acid-activable component with an apparent molecular weight of 600 kd. In acid extracts, a 5-9 kd apparent molecular weight component is responsible for the A I growth enhancement of 49F cells and the A I growth inhibition of Ki-49F cells. Further purification by reverse phase chromatography shows that both activities strictly coelute at the same point (32%) of an acetonitrile gradient. These results indicate that TGF-beta is present in physiological conditions as a latent form which requires activation for inhibiting the A I growth of transformed cells as well as for enhancing that of 49F cells.",M1
2835496,"Activation of thermosensitive RNA splicing and production of a heat-labile P85gag-mos kinase by the introduction of a specific deletion in <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-124 DNA.Murine sarcoma virus ts110 (MuSVts110) is a conditionally transformation-defective MuSV mutant lacking 1,487 bases found in its wild-type parent, MuSV-349 (MuSV-124). Expression of the MuSVts110 v-mos gene product, P85gag-mos, requires splicing of the viral transcript to align the gag and mos genes in frame. However, this splice event is restricted to growth temperatures of 33 degrees C or lower. No splicing of the viral RNA, no production of P85gag-mos, and, hence, no cell transformation is observed at growth temperatures above 33 degrees C. To determine whether thermosensitive splicing is an intrinsic property of To determine whether thermosensitive splicing is an intrinsic property of MuSVts110 RNA specified by the 1,487-base deletion or a result of a cellular defect, we examined an  equivalent  or MuSVts110 DNA (designated ts32 DNA) constructed by combining wild-type MuSV-124 DNA fragments with a synthetic oligonucleotide to yield an otherwise wild-type viral DNA containing the same 1,487-base deletion as authentic MuSVts110. As observed in control cells (6m2 cells) infected with the authentic MuSVts110 virus, NIH 3T3 cells transfected with ts32 DNA appeared morphologically transformed when grown at 33 degrees C, but were converted to a more normal, flattened shape within a few hours of a shift to 39 degrees C. In concert with these morphological changes, both the processing of the ts32 RNA transcripts and the production of ts32 p85gag-mos kinase were found to be optimal at growth temperatures from 28 to 33 degrees C, but dramatically reduced at 37 to 41 degrees C. Like authentic P85gag-mos, the ts32 P85gag-mos kinase activity was rapidly inactivated by brief exposure to 39 degrees C. These results suggested that the MuSVts110 equivalent is functionally indistinguishable from authentic MuSVts110 and that the novel temperature-sensitive splicing of MuSVts110 transcripts is specified by an intrinsic property of the viral RNA.",M1
2840624,"Transformation of bone marrow cells from E mu-myc transgenic mice by Abelson murine leukemia virus and Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>.Transgenic mice harboring a c-myc gene subjugated to the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer offer a unique opportunity to investigate whether deregulated myc expression potentiates the transformation of B lymphoid cells by other oncogenes. By assessing colony formation in semi-solid medium, we have compared the potential of bone marrow cells from E mu-myc mice and their normal littermates for transformation by Harvey murine sarcoma virus and Abelson murine leukemia virus. E mu-myc bone marrow yielded more lymphoid colonies than normal marrow after infection with Harvey virus. The increased transformation frequency may reflect increased clonogenicity due to complementation between myc and ras and/or the increased number of pre-B cells in E mu-myc marrow. Surprisingly, however, the number of lymphoid colonies induced by Abelson virus was not enhanced. Our interpretation of these results is that the primary Abelson target is more primitive than the pre-B cells expressing the E mu-myc transgene and is therefore not present at increased frequency in the E mu-myc marrow. The cells from most virus-infected E mu-myc colonies failed to grow indefinitely when placed in liquid culture in the absence of a feeder layer. Thus expression of a deregulated c-myc gene together with either v-Ha-ras or v-abl does not ensure fully autonomous growth of early B lymphoid cells.",M1
2831097,"Integration and loss of a single v-Ki-ras gene affects tumorigenic potential of human osteosarcoma cells.The human osteosarcoma cell line Te85 clone F-5 is not tumorigenic in vivo. Its transformation with Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (KiMSV) (KHOS) confers full malignant properties and stable non-tumorigenic revertants of this KHOS cell line have been obtained. Here we show that integration and expression of a single copy of the KiMSV proviral DNA, which is totally lost in the HOS 240S revertant, is responsible for the acquisition of tumorigenicity. Cytogenetic analysis and the absence of a residual LTR copy in the revertant cellular genome suggest that the loss of KiMSV provirus is caused either by chromosomal segregation or by recombination not involving the LTR. In addition analysis of the expression of ras proteins revealed no changes in the pattern of c-ras products and the expression of v-ras only in the KHOS cells. All these data suggest that Te85 and HOS 240S cell lines could represent a human alternative recipient system to rodent cells in studies with oncogenes.",M1
2831293,"Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> abolishes interferon gamma-induced class II but not class I major histocompatibility antigen expression in a murine fibroblast line.The effect of infecting fibroblasts with Kirsten murine sarcoma virus/murine leukemia virus (Ki-MSV/MLV) on constitutive and IFN-gamma-induced H-2 antigen expression was investigated. The fibroblasts used were two established cell lines (C3H10T1/2 and BALB/c3T3) and fresh embryo fibroblasts from C3H mice. Class I antigens were expressed constitutively by BALB/c3T3; infection with MLV, MSV or the two together had little effect on this constitutive expression. Class I antigens (H-2K, H-2D) were strongly induced on all three types of fibroblast by rIFN-gamma, and infection had little effect on this. None of the fibroblasts expressed constitutively detectable levels of class II antigen; however, C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts could be induced for both H-2A and H-2E by IFN-gamma. Infection of C3H10T1/2 with helper-free Ki-MSV, or MSV together with MLV, completely abolished this induction of class II antigens, while infection with MLV alone had little effect, implying that the abolition of class II induction was due to genomic regions of Ki-MSV not shared with Ki-MLV, probably the v-Ki-ras gene.",M1
2826444,"Reverse transformation of Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-transformed NIH/3T3 cells by site-selective cyclic AMP analogs.Eighteen site-selective cAMP analogs modified at either the C-8 position or the C-6 position were tested for their growth regulatory effects on the Harvey murine sarcoma virus-transformed NIH/3T3 clone 13-3B-4 cells grown in a serum-free defined medium. All 18 analogs, when tested individually, exhibited an appreciable growth inhibitory effect at micromolar concentrations. The most potent growth inhibitory analogs contained a thio moiety at the C-8 position. In general, C-6 analogs required 5-10-fold greater concentrations than C-8 analogs to produce the same degree of growth inhibition. The growth inhibition induced by these analogs was accompanied by a change in cell morphology; cells treated with the analogs exhibited the morphology characteristic of untransformed fibroblasts, while untreated cells retained a transformed phenotype. The regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the cAMP receptor protein, has two different intrachain cAMP binding sites, and cAMP analogs modified at the C-8 position (C-8 analogs) are generally selective for Site 1, while analogs modified at the C-6 position (C-6 analogs) are generally selective for Site 2. Thus, C-8 and C-6 analogs were tested in combination to enhance the growth regulatory effect. Both growth inhibition and morphological change were enhanced synergistically by a combination of the C-6 and C-8 analogs. Two C-6 analogs or two C-8 analogs added together did not cause synergism. For both growth inhibition and phenotypic change, C-8 thio analogs acted far more synergistically than C-8 amino analogs when cells were treated in combination with C-6 analogs, suggesting a response of the RII rather than the RI cAMP receptor protein. DEAE-cellulose chromatography revealed that the growth inhibition, in fact, correlates with an increase of the RII cAMP receptor protein and a decrease of the RI receptor protein. The growth inhibitory effect of the site-selective analogs was not due to the cytotoxic effect of adenosine metabolites as shown by the different behavior of 8-Cl-cAMP compared with 8-Cl-adenosine in 1) cell cycle effects and 2) release from growth inhibition. It is concluded that the observed growth inhibition and phenotypic reversion of 13-3B-4 cells is most likely mediated through the cellular effector, the RII cAMP receptor protein.",M1

The Kirsten murine leukemia virus, the Harvey murine sarcoma [corrected] virus and the amphotropic helper virus (AP292) were ineffective by themselves. Balb murine sarcoma virus and Moloney murine sarcoma virus were, to a lesser degree, able to effect adipocytic conversion of HSF.

2835972,"Dibutyryl cAMP inhibits expression of transformation-related properties in Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> transformed Balb/c-3T3 cells despite continued presence of p21v-Ki-ras.We studied the effects of simultaneous treatment with 0.1 mM N6, O2'-dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP) and 1 mM theophylline on several transformation-specific properties and on levels of the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (Ki-MSV) transforming gene product p21v-Ki-ras, in a Ki-MSV-transformed mouse cell line (Balb/c-3T3, clone A31; KA31). The rate of logarithmic growth, cell motility, and final saturation density were reduced in dbcAMP-treated KA31 cultures. Capabilities for anchorage-independent growth were reduced in treated cells, to levels similar to those observed for the untransformed parental A31 cell line. Treatment with dbcAMP had no observable effect on the binding of 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor and did not alter fluorescence staining patterns for actin microfilaments and fibronectin which, although characteristic of normal cells, were also present in KA31 cells. Changes induced by dbcAMP were readily reversible, except for loss of anchorage-independent growth. However, this property was also reversible, provided removal of dbcAMP occurred 48 h prior to inoculation into soft agar medium. Immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody directed against the protein p21v-Ki-ras (Y13-259) revealed the continued presence of this protein in dbcAMP-treated KA31 cells. We, therefore, conclude that cAMP mediates the inhibition of growth-related transformation-specific properties either by acting at steps subsequent to the expression of p21v-Ki-ras or on a pathway independent of p21ras function.",M1
2824838,"Temperature-sensitive cellular mutant for expression of mRNA from murine retrovirus.The cellular mutant B812 isolated from a Fisher rat cell line shows temperature sensitivity of focus formation induced by various retroviruses such as recombinant murine retrovirus containing the middle T gene of polyomavirus (PyMLV), Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>, Moloney murine sarcoma virus, and recombinant murine retrovirus containing the src gene of Rous sarcoma virus. B812 cells, however, show normal ability to proliferate and synthesize protein at the nonpermissive temperature, suggesting that their mutation is in a gene specifically concerned with the process of transformation by retroviruses. In this work, experiments with hybrids of mutant and wild-type cells showed that the temperature-dependent defect of this mutant was complemented by wild-type cells. To determine the step of transformation that is restricted at the nonpermissive temperature in B812, we examined the expressions of the oncogene (middle T antigen) in no. 7 (wild-type cells) and B812 cultures infected with PyMLV (the chimeric retrovirus containing the middle T gene of polyomavirus) at the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. Middle T-associated protein kinase activity, the expression of middle T antigen, and PyMLV-specific mRNA were reduced at the nonpermissive temperature in B812 cultures infected with PyMLV. However, integration of PyMLV into the chromosomal DNA of the mutant was not affected at the nonpermissive temperature. These results suggest that B812 cells have a mutation affecting the expression of viral mRNAs from integrated proviral DNA at the nonpermissive temperature.",M1
2826232,"Site-selective cAMP analogs induce nuclear translocation of the RII cAMP receptor protein in Ha-MuSV-transformed NIH/3T3 cells.Site-selective cAMP analogs, depending on the position of their substituents on the adenine ring, selectively bind to either site 1 or site 2 of the known cAMP binding sites of protein kinase. Treatment of Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-transformed NIH/3T3 cells with such site-selective analogs results in growth inhibition and phenotypic reversion, and the combination of a C-8 thio or halogen analog (site 1 selective) with an N6 analog (site 2 selective) produces a synergistic effect. We report here that the growth inhibitory effect of the analogs correlates with the nuclear translocation of the RII cAMP receptor protein, the regulatory subunit of protein kinase type II. The transformed NIH/3T3 cells contained no detectable level of RII in the nucleus, whereas nontransformed NIH/3T3 cells exhibited a high level of nuclear RII. Within 30 min after treatment of the transformed cells with the site-selective analogs, immunofluorescence against the RII protein markedly increased in the cell nucleus. The nuclear translocation of the RII cAMP receptor protein is an early event in the reverse transformation of the fibroblasts treated with site-selective cAMP analogs.",M1

2442021,"Changes in cellular gene expression in rat thyroid epithelial cells transformed by the Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>.We have exploited a recently characterized system of rat thyroid epithelial cells transformed by the wild-type (wt) and a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant strain of the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (Ki-MSV) in order to study the effects of the K-ras oncogene on the gene expression of differentiated thyroid epithelial cells. By using cDNAs isolated from normal thyroid glands as probes, we were able to identify three sets of cellular sequences whose expression is influenced by the v-K-ras oncogene. The first set of genes is irreversibly repressed by transformation with both the wt and the ts viruses. The second set of genes is repressed in the ts-Ki-MSV-transformed cells but not in the same cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature. A third set of genes is present at higher levels at the nonpermissive temperature than at the permissive temperature. This system has allowed us to isolate and characterize a number of cDNA clones belonging to each of these three sets of genes. These specific cDNAs are suitable probes to study phenotypical changes during transformation of epithelial cells.",M1

The MSV, designated NS.C58 MSV-1, induced foci of transformation in mouse and rat fibroblasts, and inoculation of mice of various strains 2 weeks of age or younger resulted in erythroleukemia and sarcomatous lesions in spleen, lymph node, and brain. The MSV provirus was molecularly cloned from a genomic library prepared from transformed non-producer rat cells. The 8.8-kilobase proviral DNA contained a 1.0-kilobase p21 ras coding segment which replaced most of the gp70-encoding portion of an MuLV, most likely the endogenous C58v-1 ecotropic virus. The ras oncogene is closely related to v-Ha-ras by hybridization, expression of p21 protein, and nucleotide sequence. It is nearly identical in sequence to v-bas, the only previously described transduced, activated mouse c-ras. At position 12 in the p21 coding region, arginine is substituted for the naturally occurring glycine present in c-ras.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resolved the hyaluronate affinity-purified fraction into three major protein bands of estimated molecular weight (Mr,e) 70K, 66K, and 56K which contained hyaluronate binding activity and which were termed hyaluronate binding proteins (HABP). Hyaluronate affinity chromatography combined with immunoaffinity chromatography, using antibody directed against the larger HABP, allowed a 20-fold purification of HABP. Fractions isolated from 3T3 supernatant medium also contained additional binding molecules in the molecular weight range of 20K. This material was present in vanishingly small amounts and was not detected with a silver stain or with [35S]methionine label. The three protein species isolated by hyaluronate affinity chromatography (Mr,e 70K, 66K, and 56K) were related to one another since they shared antigenic determinants and exhibited similar pI values. In isocratic conditions, HABP occurred as aggregates of up to 580 kilodaltons. Their glycoprotein nature was indicated by their incorporation of 3H-sugars. Enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay showed they were antigenically distinct from other hyaluronate binding proteins such as fibronectin, cartilage link protein, and the hyaluronate binding region of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan.

Spleen focus formation induced by MHSV and Ha-MuSV was not restricted by the Fv-2 resistance locus in congenic DDD and C57BL/6 mice, unlike leukemogenesis induced by Friend virus, Rauscher virus, and the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV). C57BL/6 mice were much more resistant to MHSV and Ha-MuSV-induced spleen focus formation than DDD mice regardless of their Fv-2 state. Infection of DDD mice with MHSV caused a systemic histiocytic neoplasia, best described as murine malignant histiocytosis. Transformed histiocytic cells proliferated excessively in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes and, in the final stages of the disease, in all major parenchymal organs. The Ha-MuSV caused a strikingly different benign histiocytic tumor in DDD mice and, unlike MHSV, did not induce a rapid, progressive splenomegaly in C57BL/6 mice. Infection of DDD mice with MHSV induced a rapid and synchronized depletion of early and late erythroid precursor cell pools. In MHSV-infected C57BL/6 mice comparable changes were observed with dissimilar kinetics. Macrophage colony-forming cells of MHSV-infected mice were increased in number and proliferated independently of stimulating growth factors. The disease induced by MHSV in mice can thus serve as a model for malignant histiocytosis in humans.",M1
3022469,"The effect of viral transformation on prostaglandin production depends on cell type.The role of prostaglandins in cellular differentiation and transformation has been widely studied. We have found previously that prostaglandin E2 production was greatly diminished in dog kidney cells (MDCK) after transformation by Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>. In the present study, we have shown that viral transformation can have differing effects in the ability to modify the production of prostaglandin in cultured cells. For example, the prostaglandin E2 production in rat kidney cells (NRK) is decreased after transformation by Rous sarcoma virus, while production in 3T3 cells is increased markedly after transformation by the same virus. Similarly, SV40 transformation increases prostaglandin E2 production of 3T3 cells and decreases the production in rat thyroid cells (FRTL). These results indicate that the biosynthetic pathway for prostaglandin production has varying susceptibility following viral transformation and the effect of transformation depends more on the type of cell than virus. Taking advantage of the well-defined transforming proteins encoded by polyomavirus, we have further studied the relationship between prostaglandin production in cells and the expression of T antigens in transformed cells. We showed that the expression of middle T antigen, which is associated with a protein kinase and is responsible for phenotype of transformed cells, is required for the change in prostaglandin production in cells.

We cloned the ts371 KiMuSV provirus from the genome of a conditionally transformed nonproducer cell line, ts371 KiMuSV NRK clone 5 (T. Y. Shih, M. O. Weeks, H. A. Young, and E. M. Scolnick, J. Virol. 31:546-556, 1979). The molecularly cloned virus had 1,000-fold lower transformed focus-forming activity at 39 degrees C than at 34 degrees C. The ts371-v-Ki-ras gene differed from the wild type (wt) by a single point mutation, resulting in the substitution of arginine for glutamine at amino acid residue 43 of the encoded p21. A second difference from the published sequence for wt v-Ki-ras (N. Tsuchida, T. Ryder, and E. Ohtsubo, Science 217:937-939, 1982) at amino acid residue 37 was found. However, on sequencing the wt v-Ki-ras in this region, we found that it also contained a glutamate at residue 37. Preliminary characterization of bacterially expressed wt and ts371-v-Ki-ras p21 proteins is discussed.",M1
3019533,"Modulation by normal serum factors of Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-induced transformation in adult rat cells infected in early passage.Adult rat adrenal cells, infected with Kirsten murine sarcoma virus in early passage, transform consistently in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-supplemented medium. Substitution of 3% horse serum (HS) for FBS reverses early foci and delays transformation. The influence of the serum on DNA synthesis, anchorage dependence, tumorigenicity, and subcellular Mr 21,000 transforming protein (p21) distribution was followed from infection in passage 1 to complete transformation. In FBS, increased expression of p21 preceded other evidence of transformation. Subsequently, p21-positive cells transformed morphologically, but initially their growth parallelled that of coexisting untransformed cells. Foci formed at passages 5 to 10, and the cells became anchorage independent and tumorigenic at passages 10 to 20. As transformation in FBS progressed, p21 relocated from a diffuse distribution to sites of retraction from substrata and then to ruffles and lamellae on cellular processes. Early in transformation, HS-medium reduced proliferation of morphologically normal and morphologically transformed p21-positive cells. This effect was counteracted by the addition of FBS or the Mr 50,000 to 100,000 fraction of FBS. Fully transformed, tumorigenic cells grew rapidly in both sera but, if transferred from FBS to HS, became more anchorage and density dependent, and p21 relocated from cell processes to the cell bodies. In immortal lines, the substitution of HS for FBS accelerated rather than delayed the progression of Kirsten murine sarcoma virus-induced transformation. These results show that Kirsten murine sarcoma virus-induced transformation of adult presenescent cells is controlled by physiological factors to which immortal cells appear refractory. The changes in subcellular distribution of p21 during transformation parallel the expression of some, but not other, transformation parameters and suggest a possible association of p21 with increased membrane activity.",M1
3019002,"The effect of cerulenin on the synthesis of the precursor gag polyprotein in defective murine leukemia and sarcoma virus producing cell lines.The effect of cerulenin, an inhibitor of de novo fatty acid (and cholesterol) biosynthesis, on the synthesis of the precursor gag polyprotein, Pr65gag in a defective murine leukemia virus (334C) producing murine cell line (3JE) and a defective <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (Gazdar) producing hamster cell line (HTG-2) was examined. In contrast to Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) producing cell lines (MJD-54, clone 2) the amount of the Pr65gag remaining in the presence of cerulenin (20 micrograms/ml) was greatly reduced in both defective virus-infected cells. This effect appears specific for the Pr65gag polyprotein, since the env precursor polyprotein Pr80env was normally synthesized and remained undegraded in cerulenin-treated 3JE-infected cells. Thin-section electron micrographs showed an increased accumulation of virion particles in vesicles of treated HTG-2 cells.",M1
3015415,"v-ras genes from Harvey and BALB murine sarcoma viruses can act as initiators of two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis.Activated Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> ras genes were introduced into epidermal cells in vivo by direct application of retroviruses to mouse skin. Subsequent treatment with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced benign papillomas, some of which progressed to invasive carcinomas. Initiation with virus was irreversible for at least 4 months, since TPA treatment after this latency period produced papillomas within 4 weeks. Analysis of viral integration sites showed that carcinomas are clonal in origin. Both papillomas and carcinomas express virus-specific ras mRNA and the viral form of ras P21 protein. The results show that activated ras genes can replace chemical carcinogens in initiation of mouse skin carcinogenesis. This system presents a novel approach to in vivo analysis of the biological role of oncogenes in epithelial tumorigenesis.",M1
3023943,"Mutational analysis of a ras catalytic domain.We used linker insertion-deletion mutagenesis to study the catalytic domain of the Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> v-rasH transforming protein, which is closely related to the cellular rasH protein. The mutants displayed a wide range of in vitro biological activity, from those that induced focal transformation of NIH 3T3 cells with approximately the same efficiency as the wild-type v-rasH gene to those that failed to induce any detectable morphologic changes. Correlation of transforming activity with the location of the mutations enabled us to identify three nonoverlapping segments within the catalytic domain that were dispensable for transformation and six other segments that were required for transformation. Segments that were necessary for guanosine nucleotide (GDP) binding corresponded to three of the segments that were essential for transformation; two of the three segments share strong sequence homology with other purine nucleotide-binding proteins. Loss of GDP binding was associated with apparent instability of the protein. Lesions in two of the three other required regions significantly reduced GDP binding, while small lesions in the last required region did not impair GDP binding or membrane localization. We speculate that this latter region interacts with the putative cellular target of ras. The results suggest that transforming ras proteins require membrane localization, guanosine nucleotide binding, and an additional undefined function that may represent interaction with their target.",M1
3007529,"Cell-mediated co-action of transforming growth factors: incubation of type beta with normal rat kidney cells produces a soluble activity that prolongs the ruffling response to type alpha.Intense, continuous ruffling is a characteristic of many transformed cells, but untransformed cells ruffle intensely only briefly after exposure to growth factors. We reported previously that cells of a normal rat kidney (NRK) cell line transformed by Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> secrete their own ruffle-inducing agent(s) that cause sustained ruffling in either themselves or untransformed NRK cells. In the present study, we examined the roles of the transforming growth factors TGF-alpha and TGF-beta in the induction and maintenance of ruffling in untransformed NRK cells and observed the following: TGF-alpha caused a transient epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like response, which could be blocked by prior exposure of cells to EGF or by antiserum directed against the COOH-terminus of TGF-alpha. TGF-beta caused no ruffling and did not itself prolong TGF-alpha ruffling. A new, buffer-soluble (transferable) mediator activity produced by incubation of TGF-beta with NRK cells for 6-h extended the duration of maximal TGF-alpha-induced ruffling by several-fold. This study demonstrates that TGF-alpha alone causes an EGF-like, transient ruffling response, but neither TGF-alpha or TGF-beta alone, nor the two together, cause transformation-associated sustained ruffling. Rather, TGF-alpha acts in concert with a new, TGF-beta-dependent activity. This new activity appears to inhibit normal cellular off-regulation of TGF-alpha-induced ruffling. Inhibition of the cellular off-regulation of a growth factor response could play a key role in the unregulated growth associated with malignancy.",M1
3007528,"An agent or agents produced by virus-transformed cells cause unregulated ruffling in untransformed cells.KNRK cells (a normal rat kidney [NRK] cell line transformed by Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>) in sparse culture exhibit a highly ruffled morphology, but the cause of this ruffling is unknown. In this study, we have demonstrated that the continuous, excess ruffling on KNRK cells is caused by one or more soluble agents secreted by the KNRK cells themselves. To do this study, an assay for ruffling responses in live cell cultures was defined, and its reproducibility was demonstrated. This assay permitted observation of the kinetics of ruffling responses (percentage of cells ruffled as a function of time after stimulation). This method was used to compare the kinetics of ruffling induced by insulin, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, glucose, and KNRK cell conditioned medium (CM). Ruffling was elicited on NRK cells by each of the polypeptide mitogens and nutrients, but, in each case, this ruffling subsided spontaneously within an hour. CM from KNRK cells also caused ruffling movements on untransformed NRK cells, but this ruffling continued for at least 20 h. This response was largely blocked by premixing the KNRK cell CM with rabbit IgG against rat transforming growth factor, type alpha, (TGF-alpha). KNRK cells made quiescent (ruffle free) by a pH shift (from 7.4 to 8.4) responded to insulin, glucose, and KNRK cell CM with kinetics similar to those observed for each of these factors in NRK cells. The unusual feature for the ruffle-inducing agent(s) produced by KNRK cells was that this activity was not subject, in either NRK or KNRK cells, to the cellular off-regulation that limits the responses to insulin or glucose. Thus, the continuous ruffling of KNRK cells is caused by their own unregulated ruffle-inducing agent or agents, which appear to include TGF-alpha. This work also demonstrates that kinetic analysis of cellular responses to exogenous factors can provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved in the normal limitation of these responses.",M1
3002634,"Abelson virus drives the differentiation of Harvey virus-infected erythroid cells.Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) and Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (Ha-MSV) are retroviruses carrying unrelated onc genes. However, both of these viruses are capable of stimulating the growth and differentiation of erythroid precursor cells; the target cells for both appear at the same time during fetal development and follow a similar pattern throughout ontogeny. In addition, the colonies induced by each virus are morphologically similar and synthesize the adult form of hemoglobin. However, A-MuLV-infected cells are Epo-independent, whereas Ha-MSV-infected cells are Epo-dependent. Superinfection of Ha-MSV-infected cells with A-MuLV overrides their Epo-dependency. Thus, the consequences of the infection are determined by the interaction of the different onc gene products with identical or similar erythroid cells.",M1

A potential laboratory assay for individuals at risk of cancer.The present work describes a laboratory assay for individuals predisposed to cancer within NF pedigrees. The assay is based on the association between the increased sensitivity of human skin fibroblasts to transformation by the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus and predisposition to cancer in clinically affected patients and in otherwise apparently healthy individuals within NF pedigrees. The more sensitive the cells are to transformation by KiMSV, the greater the probability that a person from whom such cells have been derived will develop cancer. The results show a strong correlation with the NF trait. Together with the clinical data this laboratory assay could, therefore, be used to ascertain the NF genotype.",M1
3023835,"Expression of viral p21ras during acquisition of a transformed phenotype by rat adrenal cortex cells infected with Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>.Rat adrenal cortex cells infected with Kirsten murine sarcoma virus acquire a transformed phenotype in a progressive fashion. The expression of the viral p21ras does not appear to correlate with the degree of transformation of the adrenocortical cells but rather is produced at similar levels as the culture becomes transformed. This indicates that the expression of an oncogenic form of p21ras is not of itself sufficient to completely transform rat adrenal cortex cells.",M1
3023817,"Direct identification of palmitic acid as the lipid attached to p21ras.p21v-H-ras, the transforming protein of Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>, contains a covalently attached lipid. Using thin-layer chromatography, we identified the acyl group as the 16-carbon saturated fatty acid palmitic acid. No myristic acid was detected in fatty acids released from in vivo-labeled p21v-H-ras. The p21v-K-ras protein encoded by Kirsten sarcoma virus was also palmitylated. The processing and acylation of p21v-K-ras however differed from that of p21v-H-ras. Three forms of [3H]palmitic acid-labeled p21ras proteins were detected in Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed cells. This contrasted with Harvey sarcoma virus, in which two forms of p21v-H-ras contained palmitic acid. Analysis by partial proteolysis of p21v-H-ras labeled with [3H]palmitic acid suggested that all of the lipid found in intact p21v-H-ras was located in the C-terminal region. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, p21v-H-ras labeled with [3H]palmitic acid migrated slightly ahead of the majority of p21v-H-ras. Of the mature forms of p21v-H-ras, apparently only a subpopulation contains palmitic acid.",M1
3022995,"Assignment of RAS proto-oncogenes in Chinese hamsters: implications for mammalian gene linkage conservation and neoplasia.HRAS and KRAS are the cellular homologs of the oncogenic transforming genes found in the Harvey strain of <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> and the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus, respectively. Phyla as diverse as insects, birds, and mammals possess distinct HRAS and KRAS sequences, suggesting that these genes are essential to metazoa. In this report, we used a clone panel of Chinese hamster X mouse C11D somatic cell hybrids segregating hamster chromosomes to map those genes. Southern filter hybridization analyses of the hybrids revealed that hamster HRAS and KRAS gene sequences are on chromosomes 3 and 8, respectively. These gene assignments are consistent with the conservation of autosomal gene linkage groups observed among hamsters, humans, and mice and may provide insight into specific chromosomal alterations that have been observed during the spontaneous neoplastic transformation of Chinese hamster fibroblasts in vitro.",M1
3007230,"Hydrocortisone promotes the neodifferentiation of Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> transformed human skin fibroblasts to adipose cells: relevance to oncogenic mechanisms.Here we have demonstrated that transformation of human skin fibroblasts (SF) by the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (KiMSV) is associated with their neodifferentiation into preadipose cells. Hydrocortisone (HC) promotes the transformation/neodifferentiation of such preadipocytes into mature fat cells. The effects of HC on the expression of adipocyte-containing foci and on the total number of transformed foci present in KiMSV-treated cultures appeared to be dose-dependent and was optimal at a concentration of about 500 ng/ml, or 1.25 X 10(-6) M. Although increasing serum concentrations (2-15%) increased the total number of transformed foci, it had no effect on the expression of adipocyte-containing foci in the presence of HC. The virus-induced preadipocytes undergoing partial conversion in the presence of HC were capable of clonal expansion and extensive proliferative activity. In contrast, mature adipocytes were terminally differentiated and as such have lost their ability to proliferate. The results suggest a role for a ras oncogene and HC in the transformation/neodifferentiation of human cells that might ultimately lead to cancer in some fraction of such cells.",M1
2997480,"Posttranslational processing of p21 ras proteins involves palmitylation of the C-terminal tetrapeptide containing cysteine-186.The p21 proteins of ras oncogenes are synthesized as precursors in the cytosol. After processing, which involves acylation, the products are associated with the plasma membrane in eucaryotic cells. The p21 overproduced in Escherichia coli, however, is not processed by acylation. A synthetic tetrapeptide of the p21 C terminus is used to identify the acylation site in eucaryotic p21 as cysteine-186. The same peptide of bacterial p21 is not acylated. Although p21 of Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-transformed NRK cells can be metabolically labeled with either [3H]palmitate or [3H]myristate, the lipid moiety of the hydrophobic peptide is identified as palmitic acid. We suggest that the enzymatic mechanism for p21 palmitylation may be different from N-terminal myristylation of many other membrane proteins.",M1
2994296,"Detection of the myristylated gag-raf transforming protein with raf-specific antipeptide sera.The post-translational modifications of the gag-raf fusion proteins of the 3611 <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV) have been examined by inhibiting glycosylation with tunicamycin and by in vivo labeling with [3H]myristic acid. The results show that P75gag-raf is myristylated but not glycosylated and that P90gag-raf is glycosylated but not myristylated (and is now termed gP90gag-raf). gP90gag-raf expression appeared to become lost during passage of the transformed cells, and consequently does not appear to be necessary for the maintenance of transformation. raf-specific sera for detecting gag-raf fusion proteins have been obtained from synthetic peptides made from different regions of the predicted v-raf sequence. Immunoprecipitation of P75gag-raf with raf-specific sera directly confirmed the deduced v-raf sequence. The fact that P75gag-raf is both myristylated and precipitated by antiserum to a predicted carboxyl-terminal peptide of the v-raf gene established that the mature protein represents the entire coding region. The gP90gag-raf thus appears to be a glycosylated form of P75gag-raf specified by the gag sequences of the fusion protein, in analogy with Pr65gag and gPr80gag of murine leukemia viruses. Antiserum to the carboxyl-terminal P75gag-raf peptide was the most efficient in immunoprecipitation, and will be useful for detecting the product of the c-raf gene.",M1
2995983,"Methionine-sensitive glycolysis in transformed cells.Glycolysis in several tumor cell lines grown in tissue culture was inhibited by methionine. Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-transformed rat kidney cells (K-NRK) were inhibited 60-75% by 10 mM methionine, whereas normal rat kidney (NRK-49F) cells showed little or no inhibition. Inhibition of glycolysis in K-NRK cells was manifest 2-4 hr after exposure to the amino acid. Glycolysis in a chemically transformed cell line of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was also sensitive to methionine, but maximal inhibition (75%) required 18-24 hr of incubation with the amino acid. Under the same conditions glycolysis in the nontransformed canine cells was less than 20% inhibited by methionine. In Ehrlich ascites tumor cells grown in tissue culture, 10 mM methionine inhibited glycolysis by about 50%. Inhibition of glycolysis, even by 50 mM methionine, was rapidly reversible. Within 2 hr after removal of methionine the rate of glycolytic activity was restored to that observed in control cells. Furthermore, inhibition by methionine required a minimum level (7%) of serum in the growth medium and inhibition was not sensitive to cycloheximide. Only amino acids that are transported by system A (including the nonmetabolized analogue methylaminoisobutyric acid) specifically inhibited glycolysis in tumor cells. The only exception was phenylalanine, which was toxic to both transformed and normal cell lines.",M1
2995562,"Synthesis of proviral DNA in inbred mouse-derived clones of cells expressing different Fv-1 phenotypes.Formation of proviral DNAs by B-tropic murine leukaemia viruses (MLVs) was examined in N-type and dually permissive mutant cells derived from two inbred mouse strains, DDD and G, both of which are N-type. In the N-type cells, formation of circular proviral DNA was strongly suppressed relative to that of linear DNA. Mutation resulting in loss of the N-type Fv-1 restriction resulted in efficient formation of circular DNA by the previously restricted B-tropic MLV. This showed that Fv-1 restriction and inhibition of closed circular DNA formation were controlled by the same gene. The efficiency of formation of circular proviral DNA by the defective Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> was determined by the tropism of the helper virus.",M1
2994213,"Contribution of promoter to tissue-specific expression of the mouse immunoglobulin kappa gene.The immunoglobulin kappa (kappa) gene promoter was activated by a  neutral  enhancer derived from Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (HaMuSV) in immunoglobulin-producing myeloma cells, regardless of the enhancer's orientation or position in the vector. In one fibroblast line (3T3) the immunoglobulin kappa gene promoter was completely inactive when linked to the HaMuSV enhancer, whereas in mouse L cells, promoter activity was observed only with the HaMuSV enhancer in tandem with the immunoglobulin kappa gene promoter. The differential behavior of the gene promoter, when activated by a neutral enhancer in these three murine cell lines, suggests that promoter sequences contribute to the tissue-specific expression of this gene.",M1
2987593,"Inhibition by retinoic acid of murine retrovirus-induced cellular transformation and tumor formation.The effect of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) on cellular transformation and on tumorigenicity of retrovirally transformed cells was investigated. RA treatment of NRK and NIH/3T3 cells transformed by BALB/c <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MuSV), Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (K-MuSV), and simian sarcoma virus resulted in a significant reduction in anchorage-dependent growth of only K-MuSV-transformed NRK cells. A 62% reduction in cell number was observed at 10(-5) M RA. In contrast, anchorage-independent growth induced by each of the viruses tested was suppressed by RA. Balb/cMSV3T3 cells showed the greatest level of sensitivity with a significant reduction in anchorage-independent growth occurring at 10(-9) M RA. The level of cytoplasmic retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) was determined in both parent and transformed cell lines. CRABP was present at a high level in all 3T3 cell types but was absent in all NRK cell lines. For testing the antineoplastic activity of RA in vivo, Balb/cMSV3T3 cells were injected intradermally into nude mice. Subsequent treatment of the tumor sites of these animals by topical application of RA resulted in a significant reduction in both tumor incidence and tumor size, confirming the in vitro results. Analysis of the level of v-onc mRNA revealed that inhibition of retroviral transformation by RA was not due to a decrease in transcription of the v-onc genes.",M1
2985821,"Development and analysis of a transformation-defective mutant of Harvey murine sarcoma tk virus and its gene product.The Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> has been cloned and induces focus formation on NIH 3T3 cells. Recombinants of this virus have been constructed which include the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus type 1 in a downstream linkage with the p21 ras gene of Harvey murine sarcoma virus. Harvey murine sarcoma tk virus rescued from cells transfected with this construct is both thymidine kinase positive and focus inducing in in vitro transmission studies. The hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine selectability of the thymidine kinase gene carried by this virus has been exploited to develop three mutants defective in the p21 ras sequence. All three are focus negative and thymidine kinase positive when transmitted to suitable cells. Of these, only one encodes a p22 that is immunologically related to p21. This mutant has been used to explore the relationship between the known characteristics of p21 and cellular transformation. Data presented herein indicate that the p21 of Harvey murine sarcoma virus consists of at least two domains, one which specifies the guanine nucleotide-binding activity of p21 and the other which is involved in p21-membrane association in transformed cells.",M1

Viral Harvey ras p21, cloned into Escherichia coli HB101 lambda/pRAS1, has been purified to homogeneity by a three-step procedure. The purified E. coli p21 can be bound by a monoclonal antibody to viral Harvey ras p21 and has an amino acid composition consistent with that predicted from its DNA sequence. Purified E. coli p21 has been shown by HPLC analysis on an ion-exchange column to contain near stoichiometric amounts of GDP. This noncovalently associated GDP is seen in the UV absorption spectrum of the purified protein.

2985965,"Myeloid cell transformation by ras-containing murine sarcoma viruses.BALB and Harvey murine sarcoma viruses contain ras transforming genes capable of altering the proliferation and differentiation of cells within the erythroid and lymphoid lineages (W. D. Hankins and E. M. Scolnick, Cell 26:91-97, 1981; J. H. Pierce and S. A. Aaronson, J. Exp. Med. 156:873-887, 1982; E. M. Scolnick et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 1:68-74). The present studies demonstrate hematopoietic targets of ras-containing viruses within the myeloid lineage. Diffuse colonies were induced by BALB or Harvey marine sarcoma virus infection of murine bone marrow cells. Generally, these colonies were made up of relatively mature macrophages which exhibited increased self-renewal capacity but eventually underwent terminal differentiation in culture. Cells from one BALB <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-induced colony displayed phenotypic markers of more immature myelomonocytic cells. This colony, designated BAMC1, readily established as a continuous cell line and was highly malignant in vivo. Exposure of these cells to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate led to the induction of a more mature myeloid phenotype, which was associated with decreased growth potential in vitro and in vivo. The effects of the inducing agent were not mediated by an alteration in the level of expression of the ras-coded p21 transforming protein. Our present findings extend the spectrum of targets whose growth is altered by ras-containing retroviruses to cells at several stages of differentiation within each of the major hematopoietic lineages.",M1
2983886,"Thyroid hormone modulation of transformation induced by Kirsten <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>.We have investigated the effect of triiodothyronine (T3) on the transformation of normal rat kidney (NRK) cells by the Kirsten strain of murine sarcoma virus (Ki-MSV). When NRK cells were grown and infected with Ki-MSV in medium lacking T3, the yield of transformed foci was about one-half that observed in the cultures supplemented with T3. Individual foci appeared somewhat later in cells grown out in medium devoid of T3. The yield of Ki-MSV released from transformed NRK cells was lower when these cells were maintained in T3-depleted medium. The results cannot be attributed to cell growth modification by T3. Normal and Ki-MSV-transformed NRK cells grew equally well in mono-layer culture in medium containing or lacking T3. Selective maintenance and removal of T3 during various phases of the transformation process indicated that T3 exerted its maximum effect on transformation rates when added to the medium 24 h prior to virus infection. T3 was less effective in modulating transformation when added simultaneously with virus infection and was ineffective if added 24 h after virus infection. The results indicate that thyroid hormone is a required factor for optimal transformation by Ki-MSV and that the hormone exerts its effects during the early phase of Ki-MSV-induced transformation.",M1

3002017,"Analysis of the cellular proto-oncogene mht/raf: relationship to the 5' sequences of v-mht in avian carcinoma virus MH2 and v-raf in <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> 3611.The avian carcinoma virus MH2 contains a hybrid gene delta gag-mht with a contiguous open reading frame of 2682 base pairs as well as v-myc and avian helper virus-related sequences. delta gag is a partial retroviral core protein gene while v-mht and v-myc are cell-drived sequences. The v-mht sequence can be divided into two regions: the v-raf-related region at its 3' end contains 969 nucleotides which are 94% related as amino acid sequence to the onc-specific v-raf sequence of murine sarcoma virus 3611 (MSV 3611), and the v-mht-specific region at its 5' end contains 173 nucleotides which are unrelated to either MSV 3611 or avian helper virus sequences. To study the origin of the v-mht-specific sequences, the 5' region of the proto-mht/raf gene was molecularly cloned from a phage lambda library containing genomic chicken sequences. Nucleic acid hybridization, heteroduplex and DNA sequence analyses indicate that the v-mht-specific sequences are encoded in three exons. The first and second exons are separated by a 3.4-kb intron while the second and third exons are separated by a 90-bp intron. The last 14 bp of the third exon are shared with v-raf and thus represent the start of v-raf-related sequences. The junction between v-mht-unrelated and related cellular sequences occurs within the first exon. There is no homology between the v-mht-unrelated sequences and the retroviral helper sequences indicating that the viral transduction of the proto-mht/raf sequences occurred through illegitimate recombination. The predominant v-mht-related messenger RNA (4.0 kb) hybridizes to several noncontiguous regions on the molecularly cloned cellular proto-mht/raf DNA indicating that the proto-mht/raf gene is distributed over at least 10 kb of DNA in the chicken genome. Thus the v-mht oncogene is a subset of its normal cellular homolog in that it lacks intervening sequences and possibly lacks 5'-coding sequences.",M1

The protein encoded by this open reading frame matches the sequence predicted for the T24 human bladder carcinoma oncogene product, p21, in all but two positions. The presence of a lysine residue in position 12 of BALB/c murine sarcoma virus p21 likely accounts for its oncogenic properties.",M1
2578839,"Amphotropic retrovirus vector transfer of the v-ras oncogene to human hematopoietic and stromal cells in continuous bone marrow cultures.Human continuous bone marrow cultures were established from intraoperative marrow specimens and infected with amphotropic murine leukemia virus (Am-MuLV) pseudotypes of Kirsten or Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>, and the biologic effects were compared with mouse continuous bone marrow cultures. Cultures were tested for production of total nonadherent granulocytes and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (GM-CFUc); virus replication by supernatant reverse transcriptase activity; percentage of adherent and nonadherent cells and GM-CFUc that released virus by infectious center assay; and for synthesis of Harvey ras p21 protein. High-efficiency, stable Am-MuLV infection of over 90% of human marrow-culture nonadherent and adherent cells and both seven- and 14-day GM-CFUc were detected as Kirsten or Harvey pseudotype virus release by infectious center assay. Synthesis of Harvey ras p21 was detected in the adherent and nonadherent cell populations of human as well as mouse continuous marrow cultures infected with Kirsten or Harvey pseudotype virus. In contrast to data with mouse cultures, cumulative production of GM-CFUc and differentiated granulocytes in human cultures was not detectably altered by Harvey or Kirsten virus infection, and all cultures ceased to produce hematopoietic cells by 20 weeks. Of 54 virus-infected cultures in ten separate experiments, 13 produced a second peak of nonadherent cells (greater than 10(5) per flask) after 20 weeks, significantly more frequently than did control uninfected cultures (one of 32). When subcultured, these harvests produced permanent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed pre-B cell lines that released the original inoculating pseudotype virus. Thus, Am-MuLV is a potentially valuable vector for inserting genetic sequences by recombinant techniques into human hematopoietic and stromal cells in culture; however, activation of EBV may be a significant complication.",M1
2981612,"Evidence for multiple steps in neoplastic transformation of normal and preneoplastic Syrian hamster embryo cells following transfection with Harvey <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> oncogene (v-Ha-ras).Neoplastic development of Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cells in culture is a multistep process in which intermediate or preneoplastic cells can be identified and isolated. In an attempt to further characterize normal and preneoplastic cells, we have compared their susceptibilities to neoplastic transformation following transfection with cloned DNA of the oncogenic virus, Harvey murine sarcoma virus (HaMSV). Normal SHE cells, which are stably nontumorigenic when injected in nude mice, are competent to take up and express exogenous DNA as demonstrated by transfection experiments with pSV2-neo DNA and certain viral DNAs. SHE cells treated with 5 micrograms of HaMSV DNA per dish remained nontumorigenic. Colonies of SHE cells, isolated after cotransfection with HaMSV and pSV2-neo DNA and selection for G418 antibiotic resistance, expressed Harvey murine sarcoma virus oncogene (v-Ha-ras) RNA and were initially morphologically altered; however, all colonies senesced when subcultured. In contrast, transfection of the cells with polyoma virus DNA alone or HaMSV DNA plus MC29 viral DNA (pSVv-myc) and then injection of the cells into nude mice resulted in progressively growing tumors of hamster origin within 3 to 5 weeks. A preneoplastic cell line, DES-4, isolated after treatment of SHE cells with the human carcinogen diethylstilbestrol, was chosen for comparative analyses. These immortalized cells are nontumorigenic and excellent recipients for exogenous DNA. In contrast to SHE cells, DES-4 cells were highly susceptible to neoplastic transformation following transfection with HaMSV DNA. To further investigate the role of HaMSV DNA in the neoplastic transformation of DES-4 cells and to determine whether this occurred as a single step, clones of DES-4 cells cotransfected with pSV2-neo and HaMSV DNAs were selected by antibiotic resistance and characterized. There was a good correlation between tumorigenicity and expression of v-Ha-ras DNA; however, the clones were highly variable in terms of their latency periods in vivo and anchorage-independent growth. Neither of these two parameters correlated with the level of expression of v-Ha-ras RNA. All of the cell lines derived from tumors and reinoculated into nude mice had short latency periods in vivo, were highly anchorage independent, and had high levels of v-Ha-ras expression. These results suggest that, in these experiments, v-Ha-ras expression was necessary, but not sufficient, for the tumorigenicity of DES-4 cells and that additional changes in the cells were acquired.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M1

17042483,"Architecture of a gamma retroviral genomic RNA dimer.Retroviral genomes contain two sense-strand RNAs that are noncovalently linked at their 5' ends, forming a dimer. Establishing a structure for this dimer is an obligatory first step toward understanding the fundamental role of the dimeric RNA in retroviral biology. We developed a secondary structure model for the minimal dimerization active sequence (MiDAS) for the Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> in the final dimer state using selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE). In this model, two self-complementary, or palindromic, sequences (PAL1 and PAL2) form extended intermolecular duplexes of 10 and 16 base pairs, respectively. The monomeric starting state was shown previously to contain a flexible domain in which nucleotides do not form stable interactions with other parts of the RNA. In the final dimer state, portions of this initial flexible domain form stable base pairs, while previously base-paired elements lie in a new flexible domain. Thus, partially overlapping and structurally well-defined flexible domains are prominent features of both monomer and dimer states. We then used hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments to characterize the global architecture of the dimer state. Extensive regions, including portions of both PAL1 and PAL2, are occluded from solvent-based cleavage indicating that the MiDAS domain does not function simply as a collection of autonomous secondary structure elements. Instead, the retroviral dimerization domain adopts a compact architecture characterized by close packing of its constituent helices.",M2
16531631,"Fluvastatin does not elevate periosteal osteogenesis induce by Moloney sarcoma virus (MSV) in mice.Several studies have demonstrated the pleiotropic effects of statins. Since Wang and associates reported that in rabbits lovastatin reduced steroid-induced bone loss, numerous authors have confirmed these data, however, others have reported conflicting results. In this study, the effects of fluvastatin on bone formation were investigated in early and late phase of osteogenesis. In the first set of experiments (early phase of osteogenesis) CFW/Ll mice were randomly divided into three groups. Two groups were injected with Moloney-<e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (Mo-MSV) into right thighs to induce orthotopic bone formation. Mice in the experimental group received fluvastatin for 11 consecutive days. Thirty days after Mo-MSV inoculation, total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase (AP) were measured and bone mineral increase was calculated. In the second set of experiments (late phase of osteogenesis), fluvastatin was administered from day 11 after Mo-MSV inoculation for 20 consecutive days. Fluvastatin administration in the early phase of osteogenesis made no significant difference in average bone increase compared with mice receiving placebo. Lipid profile and AP were not significantly affected. During late phase of osteogenesis, the average increase in femural dry mass was significantly lower in the group of mice receiving fluvastatin than in the control group. Also, Mo-MSV-initiated tumors disappeared earlier in mice treated with fluvastatin. This may be attributed to the antioncogenic potential of fluvastatin. These results also point out that orthotopic bone formation at the sites of Mo-MSV inoculation in mice seems to be a useful model to examine the pleiotropic effects of statins.",M2

The cytotoxicity of the compounds, assessed by the formazane method, was relatively low, with a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50)&gt;500 microg mL-1. Moreover, all tested compounds inhibited Herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) replication in non-cytotoxic concentrations in-vitro. Selectivity indices were in the range 9.5-46.7. Anti-HSV-1 activity of the compounds may be associated with their influence on mitotic division. All of the compounds decreased the number of cell divisions. Mitotic indices ranged from 40/1000 (4.0%) to 62/1000 (6.2%). One compound, 10-deacetyl-baccatin III, influenced the growth of tumours induced in mice by infection with Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>. The effect of the tested compounds on T lymphocyte proliferation was evaluated by measurement of the activity of tritiated thymidine incorporated into DNA of dividing cells. One compound, methyl (N-benzoyl-(2'R,3'S)-3'-phenylisoserinate), inhibited T lymphocyte proliferation.

15381349,"Construction of retroviral vectors with enhanced efficiency of transgene expression.Retroviral vectors have been widely used in gene therapy due to their simple genomic structure and high transduction efficiency. We report a construction of Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MoMSV) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) hybrid-based retroviral vectors with significantly improved efficiency of transgene expression after stable incorporation into the host genome. In these vectors, the residual gag gene coding sequence located in the extended region of packaging signal was removed. These vectors, therefore, contain no coding sequence for the gag, pol, or env gene that can be used for homologous recombination with sequences introduced in the packaging system for a recombinant competent retrovirus (RCR) generation. A strong splice acceptor site obtained from the exon/intron junction of either the chimpanzee EF1-alpha gene or the human CMV major immediate early gene was placed downstream of the MoMSV packaging signal (Psi), significantly improving the efficiency of transgene expression. The 5' LTR U3 sequence was replaced with an extended human CMV major immediate early gene enhancer/promoter for a strong expression of full-length messages from the viral backbone, helping to maintain high levels of viral titer. These newly developed retroviral vectors should facilitate RCR-free gene transfer with significantly improved efficacy in clinical gene therapy trials.",M2

12547911,"Quantitative imaging of the T cell antitumor response by positron-emission tomography.We describe a noninvasive, quantitative, and tomographic method to visualize lymphocytes within the whole animal.

Splenic T cells from animals that had rejected a Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>/Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MSV/M-MuLV)-induced tumor were marked with a PET reporter gene, injected into tumor-bearing mice, and imaged in a microPET by using a substrate specific for the reporter. Specific localization of immune T cells to the antigen-positive tumor was detected over time, by sequential imaging of the same animals. Naive T cells did not localize to the tumor site, indicating that preimmunization was required. Autoradiography and immunohistochemistry analysis corroborated the microPET data. The method we have developed can be used to assess the effects of immunomodulatory agents intended to potentiate the immune response to cancer, and can also be useful for the study of other cell-mediated immune responses, including autoimmunity.",M2
12107346,"Tumor removal enhances immunity induced by B7.1.Costimulation of tumor T cells by B7.1 has been shown to be important for eliciting cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. We constructed a stable B7.1 gene transfectant of a poorly immunogenic murine sarcoma, Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-induced tumor cell line (MMSV). This transfectant, MMSV-B7.1, failed to produce any tumor development in syngeneic mouse models. When MMSV-B7.1 was simultaneously injected with wild-type MMSV, about half of the coinjected mice remained tumor free and displayed an increase in T cell population, upregulation of the mRNA level of various cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15 and IFN-gamma, and complete rejection of reinjected MMSV. To investigate whether MMSV-B7.1 demonstrates any vaccinal effect, the transfectant was injected following the surgical removal of the primary tumor mass. Following a re-challenge with wild-type MMSV, all vaccinated mice maintained their tumor free status and displayed a rapid recovery of down-regulated cytokine levels. The results suggest that B7.1 vaccination after tumor removal might be useful for the prevention of tumor recurrence.",M2
11785186,"[Influence of newly synthesized sesquiterpenes--analogs of taxol on multiplication of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1MC) and retrovirus (Mo-MSV)]The study comprised newly synthesized sesquiterpenoid analogs of taxol. The synthesis of the compounds was performed at the Institute of Organic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences. Cytotoxicity of the compound was assessed using formazan method. In in vitro studies the cell cultures were infected with HSV-1MC. The tested compounds were added in different concentrations to the cell culture after viral infection. Titer of the virus was expressed in TCID50/ml at particular stages of the experiments. In in vivo experiments NMRI mice were infected intramuscularly with a Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (Mo-MSV). Tested compounds were administered to the mice intravenously on the day of virus inoculation. In Mo-MSV-infected mice dynamics of tumor progression and regression was assessed, as well as a mean time interval of tumor disappearance.

11676414,"Effect of propolis extract on malignant cell transformation by moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>.An aqueous extract of propolis was found to significantly inhibit NIH/3T3 cell malignant transformation by Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MuSV-124). The inhibitory effect of propolis extract was most effective when it was added 2 h before infection or at the time of infection. The continuous presence of propolis extract in the culture medium was essential for full prevention of malignant cell transformation. When treatment with propolis extract was terminated, five to ten days post-infection, there was a significant recovery in cell transformation. These results suggest that propolis extract inhibits a late step after provirus integration into the host genome. Addition of propolis extract after infection with MuSV significantly inhibited cell transformation. The inhibitory effect of propolis appeared to be the result of the inhibition of primary--not secondary--infections, since MuSV-124 yields a virus-nonproducing infection.",M2
11314003,"A single Glu(62)-to-Lys(62) mutation in the Mos residues of the R7Delta447Gag-tMos protein causes the mutant virus to induce brain lesions.We previously reported that R7Delta447, a 2954-base-pair (bp) laboratory-generated Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>, induced subcutaneous tumors in about 14% of infected mice but did not induce brain lesions. We now report that R7Delta447K, a spontaneous mutant of R7Delta447, induced brain lesions as well as subcutaneous tumors in all injected mice. The genomes of the two viruses differ in a single base pair: the deduced Glu(62) of the Mos residue of the R7Delta447 Gag-tMos protein is changed to Lys(62). More R7Delta447 than R7Delta447K focus-forming units were detected in both NIH3T3 and mouse cerebral vascular endothelial (MCVE) cells. However, R7Delta447K transformed NIH3T3 and MCVE cells more acutely than did R7Delta447. A distinctive feature that distinguished the morphologic transformation of R7Delta447- and R7Delta447K-infected MCVE cells is the markedly prolonged spindle-shaped phase exhibited by R7Delta447-infected MCVE cells. In addition, R7Delta447K was more efficient in inducing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 than R7Delta447 in both MCVE and NIH3T3 cells. Moreover morphologic transformation was inhibited, and levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 were reduced when R7Delta447- or R7Delta447K-infected NIH3T3 or MCVE cells were grown in the presence of the MEK1/2-specific inhibitor PD98095. Thus, we have identified a key residue in the Gag-tMos protein that profoundly affects activation of the Mos/MEK/ERK pathway, virus and cell replication, morphologic transformation in vitro and pathogenicity in vivo.",M2
10951557,"Changes in the N- and C-terminal sequences of the murine R7 Gag-tMos protein affect brain lesion induction.Our preliminary studies suggested that the novel gag-truncated mos (tmos) open reading frame (ORF) of R7, a spontaneous deletion mutant of Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> 124 (MoMuSV124), may be responsible for R7's unique ability to induce brain lesions in all R7-injected mice. However, when we replaced the gag-tmos ORF with either the MoMuSV124 or the homologous myeloproliferative sarcoma virus env-mos gene, we found that both recombinant viruses also induced brain lesions in all injected mice. Although these studies suggested that the critical determinants for brain lesion induction may reside in the tmos sequence common to all three viruses, they did not demonstrate if the N-terminus of Mos was dispensable for this activity. By inserting the FLAG sequence at the 3' end of the R7 gag-tmos ORF, we demonstrated that R7 does synthesize a Gag-tMos fusion protein. Using R7 gag deletion mutants with and without the FLAG sequence, we further demonstrated that (i) deletion of the entire gag sequence abolished R7's transforming activity; (ii) the ability of the virus to transform cultured NIH/3T3 cells was significantly reduced only when most of gag was deleted; (iii) the ability of the virus to induce brain lesions was inversely proportional to the extent of its gag deletions; and (iv) the insertion of FLAG at the Mos C-terminus did not reduce the in vitro transforming activity of the FLAG-tagged viruses but did reduce their ability to induce brain lesions. Thus, we have demonstrated that altering the N- or C-terminus of the R7 Gag-tMos fusion protein can affect disease manifestation.",M2
10822324,"Studies on the pathology, especially brain hemorrhage and angioendotheliomas, induced by two new mos-containing viruses.Recombinant virus 7 (R7), a spontaneous deletion mutant of SV7, which is itself a molecular clone of Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> 124 (MoMuSV 124), induces brain lesions and tumors of the subcutaneous tissue and spleen in all infected mice. In contrast, SV7 only induces tumors of the spleen and subcutaneous tissues. One of the genetic differences between R7 and SV7 is that R7 encodes a Gag-Mos protein whereas SV7 encodes an Env-Mos protein. To investigate whether the novel R7 gag-mos oncogene is required for brain lesion induction, two viruses (SV7d1 and SVM1) were constructed in which the R7 gag-mos sequences and the adjacent 53 bp of the 5' noncoding sequence were replaced by either the SV7 or myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) env-mos oncogenes, respectively. Like R7, SV7d1 and SVM1 induced brain lesions and tumors in the spleen and subcutaneous tissues. A prominent component of R7-, SV7d1-, and SVM1-induced tumors of the brain, subcutaneous tissues, and spleen was the presence of abnormally enlarged cells with eccentric nuclei lining vessels, scattered singly or in small clusters. Their size, localization to the luminal surface of distended vessels, and binding to Bandeiraea simplicifolia (BS-1) lectin, an endothelial cell (EC) marker, suggest that they are most likely transformed ECs. Our findings therefore indicate that the induction of brain lesions is not limited to the expression of the R7 Gag-Mos protein. However, our findings also indicate that expression of the different forms of the Mos protein results in differences in the relative abundance of ECs in brain angioendotheliomas and subcutaneous and spleen tumors induced by these viruses.",M2
9660984,"Antiretroviral efficacy and pharmacokinetics of oral bis(isopropyloxycarbonyloxymethyl)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine in mice.To overcome the low oral bioavailability of the highly potent and selective antiretroviral agent (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA), a new lipophilic ester derivative, i.e., the bis(isopropyloxycarbonyloxymethyl)-ester [bis(POC)-PMPA], was prepared. The usefulness of bis(POC)-PMPA as an oral prodrug for PMPA was investigated in the intestinal mucosa Caco-2 cell monolayer model. The total transport of bis(POC)-PMPA was 2.7%, whereas it was less than 0.1% for PMPA. Bis(POC)-PMPA was considerably metabolized inside the epithelial cells, since the majority of the compound was recovered after transport in the form of the monoester metabolite [mono(POC)-PMPA]. In contrast, bis(POC)-PMPA was relatively resistant to degradation at the luminal side of the Caco-2 cells. Pharmacokinetic studies with mice showed that the oral bioavailability of bis(POC)-PMPA (calculated from the curves of the concentration of free PMPA in plasma) was 20%. Neither bis(POC)-PMPA nor mono(POC)-PMPA could be recovered in plasma, suggesting the efficient release of the active drug PMPA after oral administration of bis(POC)-PMPA. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice infected with Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV) and treated orally with bis(POC)-PMPA for 5 or 10 days (dosages, 50, 100, or 200 mg of PMPA equivalent per kg of body weight per day) showed a significant delay in MSV-induced tumor appearance and tumor-associated death. The antiviral efficacy of oral bis(POC)-PMPA was related to the dosage and treatment period and was not significantly different from that of subcutaneous PMPA given at an equivalent dose. The favorable pharmacokinetic profile, marked antiviral efficacy, and low toxicity make bis(POC)-PMPA an attractive oral prodrug of PMPA that should be further pursued in clinical studies with patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B virus.",M2
9626055,"Studies on the pathology, especially brain lesions, induced by R7, a spontaneous mutant of Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> 124.We have recently isolated R7, a spontaneous Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MoMuSV) 124 variant. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis showed that, relative to MoMuSV 124, R7 has an extra repeat in each enhancer and a truncated mos gene in frame with the truncated gag coding sequence. This report presents a detailed study on the pathology induced by R7. R7 induced not only sarcomas with well developed angiomatous components but also brain lesions. Brain lesions were observed in all less-than-48-hour-old BALB/c mice inoculated with greater than 2 x 10(5) R7 focus-forming units (FFUs). R7 was detected in all brains examined by day 9 after inoculation, and brain lesions were observed in two of four mice examined by day 14 after inoculation. Light microscopy of brains revealed that approximately 15% of the lesions were unenclosed blood pools of varying sizes containing red blood cells and inflammatory cells spreading into surrounding brain tissues. The remainder of the brain lesions had tumor cells. These lesions ranged from a few enlarged vascular endothelial cells intermixed with blood cells to large circumscribed lesions consisting of well developed tangled masses of vessels surrounded by blood pools. Activated astrocytes surrounded and infiltrated the tumors. In addition, the thymus of R7-infected mice regressed significantly and precipitously due to apoptosis (especially of cortical thymocytes) at the end stage of the disease.",M2
9299634,"R7, a spontaneous mutant of Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> 124 with three direct repeats and an in-frame truncated gag-mos gene, induces brain lesions.We have isolated Recombinant 7 (R7), a spontaneous mutant of SV7, a molecular clone of MoMuSV124. Like SV7, R7 induces subcutaneous fibrosarcomas, spleen tumors, and mesentery tumors infiltrated by proliferating vessels lined by transformed endothelial cells. However, it also induces brain lesions. We have molecularly cloned and sequenced the R7 proviral DNA and shown that the R7 genome consists of 3401 bp. It has three direct repeats in each enhancer. Its coding sequence consists of only 176 bp of p15, 263 bp of p30, a 7-bp insertion, and 853 bp of an N-terminally truncated mos gene. From the sequence of R7 we have deduced that the truncated mos sequence is in-frame with all of the gag sequence and the 7-bp insertion. The incorporation of the 3' end of the p15 sequence further suggests that the R7 Gag-Mos is myristylated. We have also shown that the molecularly cloned R7 virus transformed NIH/3T3 fibroblasts about sevenfold better than the parental SV7. We have also confirmed that molecularly cloned R7 induces the same disease phenotype as that induced by the nonmolecularly cloned R7.",M2
9295036,"CD28 is not required for rejection of unmanipulated syngeneic and autologous tumors.To gain a better understanding of the requirement of CD28 co-stimulation in different types of T cell-dependent tumor rejection responses, we performed a series of syngeneic and autologous tumor rejection experiments on CD28 knockout mice. In a preimmunization-challenge model, virally-induced ALC lymphoma and methylcholanthrene-induced MC57X fibrosarcoma transplants were rejected similarly by syngeneic CD28 knockout and immunocompetent controls. ALC-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and MC57X-specific tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release were induced in CD28 knockouts, although at a reduced level in the latter case. Secondly, the spontaneous regression of Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MMSV)-induced primary tumors in the autologous hosts occurred equally in CD28 knockouts and in immunocompetent control mice. A comparable virus-specific CTL response was generated in both, as revealed in cytolytic assays against RBL-5 targets. Thirdly, the spontaneous rejection of the B7-transfected EL-4 lymphoma by immunocompetent hosts was abrogated in CD28 knockout mice, since more than 82% CD28 knockouts developed tumors after inoculation with B7-transfected EL-4 cells. Our results therefore show that CD28 co-stimulatory molecules are not required for the rejection of unmanipulated syngeneic tumors in hyperimmunized hosts and the regression of MMSV-induced sarcoma in autochthonous hosts.",M2

The aryloxyphosphoramidate derivatives of ddA (Cf 1093) and d4A (Cf 1001) showed markedly superior (100-1000-fold) efficacies than the parent drugs against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV) and human hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication regardless of the cell type in which the virus replication was studied (i.e., human T-lymphocyte CEM, MT-4, Molt/4 and C8166 cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), monocyte/macrophages (M/M), murine embryo fibroblasts and human hepatocyte cells). Also the selectivity index (ratio of cytotoxic concentration/antivirally effective concentration) of both aryloxyphosphoramidate prodrugs was markedly increased. In particular the d4A prodrug Cf 1001 showed a selectivity index of 300-3000 as compared with 2-3 for the parental d4A in established laboratory cell lines. Also Cf 1001 had a selectivity index of 400-650 in HIV-1-infected PBL and M/M, respectively. Both Cf 1001 and Cf 1093 were equally efficient as 3TC (lamivudine) in inhibiting HBV replication in hepatocytes, and rank among the most potent HIV and HBV inhibitors reported so far in cell culture.",M2
9032388,"Utilization of nonhomologous minus-strand DNA transfer to generate recombinant retroviruses.During reverse transcription, minus-strand DNA transfer connects the sequences located at the two ends of the viral RNA to generate a long terminal repeat. It is thought that the homology in the repeat (R) regions located at the two ends of the viral RNA sequences facilitate minus-strand DNA transfer. In this report, the effects of diminished R-region homology on DNA synthesis and virus titer were examined. A retrovirus vector, PY31, was constructed to contain the 5' and 3' cis-acting elements from Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> and spleen necrosis virus. These two viruses are genetically distinct, and the two R regions contain little homology. In one round of replication, the PY31 titer was approximately 3,000-fold lower than that of a control vector with highly homologous R regions. The molecular characteristics of the junctions of minus-strand DNA transfer were analyzed in both unintegrated DNA and integrated proviruses. Short stretches of homology were found at the transfer junctions and were likely to be used to facilitate minus-strand DNA transfer. Both minus-strand strong-stop DNA and weak-stop DNA were observed to mediate strand transfer. The ability of PY31 to complete reverse transcription indicates that minus-strand DNA transfer can be used to join sequences from two different viruses to form recombinant viruses. These results suggest the provocative possibility that genetically distinct viruses can interact through this mechanism.",M2

SRR-SB3 was toxic to MT-4 cells at a concentration of 15.9 micrograms/ml, resulting in a selectivity index of 9 in these cells. This macrolide was also effective against various other HIV-1 strains, including clinical isolates and HIV-1 strains resistant to protease inhibitors and nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. It was also active against various HIV-2 strains, simian immunodeficiency virus (strain MAC251), and Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>, but not against viruses other than retroviruses. In addition, the compound was found to inhibit chronic HIV-1 infections in vitro. The compound in combination with other antiviral agents, such as zidovudine, zalcitabine, and stavudine, showed an effect that was between additive and synergistic. Time-of-addition experiments indicated that SRR-SB3 acts at a late stage of the HIV-1 replicative cycle.",M2
8709285,"The Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> ts110 5' splice site signal contributes to the regulation of splicing efficiency and thermosensitivity.The 5' splice site signal (5'ss) in Moloney murine sarcoma virus ts110 (MuSVts110) RNA was found to participate in the regulation of its splicing phenotype. This 5'ss (CAG/GUAGGA) departs from the mammalian consensus (CAG/GURAGU) at positions +4 and +6, both of which base pair with U1 and U6 small nuclear RNAs during splicing. A doubling in splicing efficiency and near elimination of the splicing thermosensitivity characteristic of MuSVts110 were observed in 5'ss mutants containing a U at position +6 (termed 5' A6U), even in those in which U1-5'ss complementarity had been reduced. At the permissive temperature (28 degrees C), the 5' A6U mutation increased the efficiency of the second splicing reaction, while at the nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C), both splicing reactions were positively affected.",M2

8631602,"Anti-L-selectin monoclonal antibody treatment in mice enhances tumor growth by preventing CTL sensitization in peripheral lymph nodes draining the tumor area.To examine the in vivo contribution of L-selectin in the sensitization of tumor-specific CTL, we investigated the effects of treatment with the anti-L-selectin monoclonal antibody (MAb) MEL-14 on the immune response to Moloney-<e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (M-MSV)-induced tumors, which exhibit spontaneous regression following generation of a strong virus-specific CTL response. Daily systemic administration of MEL-14 for 10 days to M-MSV-injected mice gave rise to larger sarcomas that persisted for a longer time, compared with those arising in control mice injected with virus only. The enhanced tumor growth could not be attributed to cytotoxic activity on leukocytes by MEL-14 since no reduction in the total cell number was detected in peripheral blood and spleen of MAb-treated mice. Evaluation of the immunological response in MAb-treated animals revealed a strong reduction in the generation of virus-specific CTL precursors (CTLp) in tumor-draining peripheral lymph nodes (PLN) 10 and 15 days after M-MSV injection, while in spleen, where lymphocyte localization is independent of L-selectin expression, CTLp generation was only delayed. By day 20, when tumors had begun to regress, the CTLp number showed a marked increase in both spleen and local PLN, where naive recirculating CTL could now enter because L-selectin was no longer down-regulated or blocked by the injected MAb. Our findings indicate that functional inactivation of L-selectin by MEL-14 treatment prevented migration of naive L-selectin+CTL through high endothelial venules (HEV) and their accumulation in PLN draining the tumor area, thereby precluding the initiation of a tumor-specific CTL response that takes place primarily at this site.",M2
8787873,"Antiretroviral activity and pharmacokinetics in mice of oral bis(pivaloyloxymethyl)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine, the bis(pivaloyloxymethyl) ester prodrug of 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine.Lipophilic ester prodrugs of 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA), i.e., bis(pivaloyloxymethyl)-PMEA [bis(POM)-PMEA] and diphenyl-PMEA, have been synthesized in an attempt to increase the oral bioavailability of this broad-spectrum antiviral agent. The antiretroviral efficacy was determined in severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice infected with Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV). They were treated twice daily for 5 days after infection. Oral treatment with bis(POM)-PMEA at a dose equivalent to 100 or 50 mg of PMEA per kg of body weight per day proved markedly effective in delaying MSV-induced tumor formation and death of the mice. Oral bis(POM)-PMEA afforded anti-MSV efficacy equal to that of subcutaneous PMEA given at equimolar doses. Oral treatment with PMEA or diphenyl-PMEA proved less efficient. Similarly, in mice infected with Friend leukemia virus (FLV), oral treatment with bis(POM)-PMEA at a dose equivalent to 100 or 50 mg of PMEA per kg per day effected a marked inhibition of FLV-induced splenomegaly (87 and 48% inhibition, respectively), the efficacy being equal to that of PMEA given subcutaneously at equivalent doses. Pharmacokinetic experiments with mice showed that the oral bioavailabilities of PMEA following oral gavage of bis(POM)-PMEA, diphenyl-PMEA, or PMEA (at a dose equivalent to 50 mg of PMEA per kg) were 53,3, and 16%, respectively. These data were calculated from the levels of free PMEA in plasma. Also, the recoveries of free PMEA in the urine upon oral administration of bis(POM)-PMEA, diphenyl-PMEA, or PMEA (at a dose equivalent to 25 mg of PMEA per kg) were 48, 4, and 7%, respectively. Oral bis(POM)-PMEA was not recovered from plasma, suggesting that it was readily cleaved to free PMEA. In contrast, diphenyl-PMEA was not efficiently cleaved to free PMEA, resulting in a rather low oral bioavailability of PMEA from this prodrug. Bis(POM)-PMEA appears to be an efficient oral prodrug of PMEA that deserves further clinical evaluation in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals.",M2
7494282,"Branchpoint and polypyrimidine tract mutations mediating the loss and partial recovery of the Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> MuSVts110 thermosensitive splicing phenotype.Balanced splicing of retroviral RNAs is mediated by weak signals at the 3' splice site (ss) acting in concert with other cis elements. Moloney murine sarcoma virus MuSVts110 shows a similar balance between unspliced and spliced RNAs, differing only in that the splicing of its RNA is, in addition, growth temperature sensitive. We have generated N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU)-treated MuSVts110 revertants in which splicing was virtually complete at all temperatures and have investigated the molecular basis of this reversion on the assumption that the findings would reveal cis-acting elements controlling MuSVts110 splicing thermosensitivity. In a representative revertant (NMU-20), we found that complete splicing was conferred by a G-to-A substitution generating a consensus branchpoint (BP) signal (-CCCUGGC- to -CCCUGAC- [termed G(-25)A]) at -25 relative to the 3' ss. Weakening this BP to -CCCGAC- [G(-25)A,U(-27)C] moderately reduced splicing at the permissive temperature and sharply inhibited splicing at the originally nonpermissive temperature, arguing that MuSVts110 splicing thermosensitivity depends on a suboptimal BP-U2 small nuclear RNA interaction. This conclusion was supported by results indicating that lengthening the short MuSVts110 polypyrimidine tract and altering its uridine content doubled splicing efficiency at permissive temperatures and nearly abrogated splicing thermosensitivity. In vitro splicing experiments showed that MuSVts110 G(-25)A RNA intermediates were far more efficiently ligated than RNAs carrying the wild-type BP, the G(-25)A,U (-27)C BP, or the extended polypyrimidine tract. The efficiency of ligation in vitro roughly paralleled splicing efficiency in vivo [G(-25)A BP &gt; extended polypyrimidine tract &gt; G(-25)A,U(-27)C BP &gt; wild-type BP]. These results suggest that MuSVts110 RNA splicing is balanced by cis elements similar to those operating in other retroviruses and, in addition, that its splicing thermosensitivity is a response to the presence of multiple suboptimal splicing signals.",M2
7729948,"Role of anti-LFA-1 and anti-ICAM-1 combined MAb treatment in the rejection of tumors induced by Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (M-MSV).We investigated the effect of combined treatment with anti-LFA-1 and anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in the immune reaction to Moloney-murine-sarcoma-virus(M-MSV)-induced tumors, which spontaneously regress due to the generation of a strong virus-specific cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte(CTL) response. Repeated systemic administration of both MAbs to M-MSV-injected mice enhanced tumor growth and delayed regression, while treatment with a single MAb had a similar, though less pronounced, effect. The immune depression achieved could not be attributed to lymphocyte depletion, because no reduction in the total number of leukocytes was detected in the peripheral blood or spleen of these mice. However, anti-LFA-I MAb, alone or in combination with anti-ICAM-I MAb, prevented lymphocyte homing in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Cytofluorimetric analysis disclosed a profound down-modulation of LFA-I and ICAM-I molecule expression on T cells following in vivo MAb treatment. Moreover, in anti-LFA-I MAb-treated mice, the receptor was coated to saturation, while anti-ICAM-I MAb treatment brought about ICAM-I-molecule-coating levels below saturation. Evaluation of M-MSV-specific CTL precursor (p) frequency in lymphoid organs of mice receiving combined MAb treatment showed that CTL generation was greatly reduced 10 days after M-MSV injection, and returned to control levels by day 15. Our findings indicate that systemic administration of MAbs to LFA-I and ICAM-I molecules brings about a strong immune suppressive effect which is mainly due to a block in T-lymphocyte re-circulation, and activation by tumor cells. However, this immune-depressive effect is only temporary, and strictly dependent on continuous MAb administration. Thus, our data suggest that treatment with anti-LFA-I and anti-ICAM-I MAbs combined is unable to induce T-cell tolerance in a highly immunogenic system.",M2
7824263,"Overexpression of mos oncogene product in Swiss 3T3 cells induces apoptosis preferentially during S-phase.When Swiss 3T3 cells are acutely infected with Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> containing the v-mos oncogene, 90% of the cells round up and detach from the monolayer (floating cells) and express high levels of v-Mos. The majority of the floating cells are generated between 30 and 70 h post infection when the cellular level of Mos reaches approximately 0.1% of the total protein. Seventy percent of the floating cells exclude trypan blue but are growth arrested with 2C or 4C DNA content, whereas the remaining floating cells with &lt; 2C DNA content, are dead or dying, and show characteristic apoptotic phenotypes. The apoptotic cells are most likely generated from cells in S-phase since these cells are absent from the viable floating cell population and the percentage of cells with &lt; 2C DNA approximated the expected S-phase fraction of logarithmically growing cells. In addition, 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-labeling studies showed that approximately 50% of the floating cells with typical apoptotic phenotypes were metabolically-labelled with the drug. These analyses show that cell populations in different stages of the cell cycle are differently affected by high levels of v-Mos expression and cells in S-phase appear to be uniquely sensitive and undergo apoptosis.",M2

It is now reported that 100 microM (2-[2-[(2-amino-1,6-dihydro-6-oxo-9H-purin-9-yl)methyl]-phenyl]ethenyl) - phosphonic acid (MDL 74,428), a very potent inhibitor of PNP blocks the intracellular phosphorolysis of ddI in cultured human red blood cells, in T leukemic CEM lymphoblasts and prolongs ddI plasma effective concentration in mice at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight given i.p. In MDL 74,428-treated CEM cells, despite marked reduction of ddI catabolism, neither further accumulation of ddATP, the active antiviral metabolite of ddI, nor potentiation of the activity of ddI against HIV cytopathogenicity is observed. MDL 74,428 does not also affect the inhibitory effect of ddI combined with ribavirin on the transformation in vitro of C3H/3T3 cells by Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV). In mice, on the contrary, MDL 74,428 (200 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) is effective at potentiating the effect of ribavirin used either alone, or combined with ddI on MSV-induced tumour formation and associated mortality. However, in the absence of ribavirin, co-administration of MDL 74,428 with ddI affords, no chemotherapeutic advantage.",M2
8292554,"A temporal study of the lesions induced by MoMuSV-349.We used time point studies to document the progression of neoplasms, haematologic abnormalities and associated lesions induced by Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-349 (MoMuSV-349). BALB/c mice inoculated intraperitoneally with MoMuSV-349 first developed histologically discernible lesions at 14 days post-inoculation (d.p.i.). The initial neoplasms were characterized by whorls of fusiform or spindle-shaped cells enmeshing dense infiltrates of neutrophils and macrophages. By 21 d.p.i., clinical signs associated with MoMuSV-349 infection were evident. The distribution of the neoplasms was more widespread, although the histologic appearance of the tumours was very similar to that found at 14 d.p.i. All mice sacrificed at 28 d.p.i. exhibited characteristic clinical signs associated with MoMuSV-349, including moderate cachexia. Histologically, neoplasms observed at 28 d.p.i. contained a significant vascular component. By 35 d.p.i., all mice exhibited severe clinical signs (e.g. cachexia, dull hair coat, uneven gait). Histologically, all the neoplasms had a predominant vascular component. Non-neoplastic lesions, such as severe thymic atrophy and multifocal pulmonary haemorrhage, were commonly present. Mice sacrificed 42 d.p.i. were clinically, grossly and histologically similar to those sacrificed at 35 d.p.i. However, one difference found in the 42 d.p.i. group was the presence of rare rhabdomyosarcomas infiltrating the skeletal muscles. Mice inoculated with MoMuSV-349 developed severe neutrophilia and lymphopenia, and moderate anaemia. This study demonstrates that MoMuSV-349 induced angiosarcomatous neoplasms are characterized by stage development and severe haematologic and non-neoplastic abnormalities.",M2
8503192,"Infection with Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> inhibits myogenesis and alters the myogenic-associated (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase expression and activity.Infection of rat skeletal muscle cultures on the first or second day in vitro with Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV) led to the arrest of myotube formation and to inhibition of both the synthesis of the muscle-specific proteins acetylcholine receptors and creatine kinase and the expression of the myosin light chain-2. Mos-specific RNA transcripts were readily detected at 1 day after infection indicating that viral genes were expressed in infected cells. In parallel, the expression of the cell growth-associated gene--c-myc--in uninfected muscle cultures was drastically reduced with time, while in MSV-infected myoblasts, the amount of c-myc-specific RNA transcripts gradually increased with time after infection. Under these conditions we could demonstrate that the interferon-induced gene (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5A synthetase) was transiently activated in uninfected muscle culture reaching a peak activity on the third day. Infection of myoblasts with murine leukemia virus did not alter the pattern of 2-5 synthetase activity observed in uninfected cells. However, infection with MSV on the second day led to a slight reduction in activity followed by a significant increase on the sixth and seventh day. Similarly, 2-5A synthetase gene expression was down-regulated with time in culture in uninfected myoblasts while re-expressed between the fourth and seventh days in MSV-infected cultures.",M2

We have established several independent transgenic mouse lines expressing this transgene. One of these lines, designated MSV125, is characterized by the development of congenital cataracts and either pancreatic or brain tumors. The development and histopathology of the pancreatic tumors were studied by light microscopy and immunocytochemistry for large T antigen, neuron-specific enolase, insulin, proinsulin, glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, gastrin, and serotonin. The 23 tumors examined were similar to human endocrine pancreatic tumors with respect to their macroscopic and histological features. We classified 91% of the tumors as insulinomas based on the predominance of insulin immunoreactivity. In newborn and young transgenic animals, nesidioblastosis and islet cell proliferation, consisting mostly of insulin containing beta cells, was obvious and persisted into adulthood. In transgenic animals more than 2 months old, islet hyperplasia and dysplasia predominated from which single tumors developed. Hyperplastic and dysplastic islets were composed mostly of beta cells. Large T antigen was detectable not only in tumor cells, but also in cells of normal and hyperplastic islets and in islet anlagen of newborn transgenic mice, indicating expression of the transgene in the endocrine part of the pancreas. Large T antigen-immunoreactivity was restricted to the beta cells. Insulinomas of the MSV-simian virus 40 T antigen-derived MSV125 transgenic mouse line may represent a valuable model for the study of the development and biology of insulinoma.",M2

Rapid DNA extraction by proteinase K digestion, followed by CHROMA SPIN + TE-100 column purification proved to be satisfactory. Two pairs of overlapping primers, flanking 1026 base pair (bp) to 221 bp, allowed to choose among four different length of DNA-amplified segments. Although net amplification was obtained for frozen tissue and tumor cultured cells in all combinations of primers, the maximum specificity and sensitivity resulted with 602 bp fragment. This product was fully and adequately digestible using Apa I and Sau3A I restriction endonucleases. DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded sections yielded an amplification product only when the primer pair which delineated a 221-bp segment was used. This reproducible method could be useful for diagnostic and for pathogenetic investigations of MoMuSV infections.",M2

As a rule, the HPMP derivatives proved effective against DNA viruses but not RNA viruses or retroviruses. In particular, (S)-HPMPA, (S)-HPMPDAP, and (R)- and (S)-HPMPG were exquisitely inhibitory to herpes simplex virus type 1 (50% effective concentrations, 0.63, 0.22, 0.10, and 0.66 microM, respectively). The FPMP and PMP derivatives showed marked inhibitory activities against retroviruses but not DNA viruses. The (S)-enantiomer of FPMPA and the (R)-enantiomer of PMPA were approximately 30- to 100-fold more effective against human immunodeficiency virus and Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV) than their enantiomeric counterparts. In contrast, both (S)- and (R)-enantiomers of the DAP and G derivatives proved equally effective against retroviruses, except for (R)-PMPDAP, which was 15- to 40-fold more inhibitory than (S)-PMPDAP. (R)-PMPDAP emerged as the most potent and selective inhibitor of MSV-induced transformation of murine C3H/3T3 cells and human immunodeficiency virus-induced cytopathicity in MT-4 and CEM cells (50% effective concentration, approximately 0.1 to 0.6 microM). When administered intraperitoneally at a single dose as low as 2 mg/kg, (R)-PMPDAP efficiently decreased MSV-induced tumor formation in newborn NMRI mice and significantly increased the survival time of MSV-infected mice.

We now demonstrate that PMEDAP is highly efficacious when given orally to mice infected with either Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV), Friend leukemia virus (FLV), or murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). PMEDAP markedly delayed MSV-induced tumor initiation when administered orally at 50, 100, or 250 mg/kg/day during 5 subsequent days. At the highest dose (250 mg/kg/day), PMEDAP completely prevented tumor formation in the MSV-infected animals. PMEDAP also caused 84-96% inhibition of FLV-induced splenomegaly when given orally to FLV-infected mice at 50-250 mg/kg/day. These PMEDAP treatment regimens were also markedly effective in increasing the survival rate of MCMV-infected mice. Intraperitoneal PMEDAP achieved a comparable antiviral activity at 2- to 5-fold lower doses than oral PMEDAP. However, the therapeutic index (ratio of the toxic dose to the antivirally effective dose) of oral PMEDAP was substantially higher than that of intraperitoneal PMEDAP. Oral PMEDAP at doses of 100, 250, or 500 mg/kg resulted in plasma PMEDAP levels of 0.5-2.5 micrograms/ml, which were sustained for 3 or 6 hours after administration and may account for the high antiviral efficacy achieved.",M2

Challenge of mice with the dose of sarcoma cells, which was lethal for 20/20 untreated control recipients, revealed that 8/20 IL-2-pretreated mice were protected by the local IL-2 treatment and survival indefinitely. Nine out of twenty IL-2-pretreated mice died during the same time period as the control mice, i.e., during 36 days, and 3/20 IL-2 pretreated mice were tumour-negative until day 60, when incipient tumours arose. The three late tumours were used as a model to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of the new cycles of repeated local IL-2 administration. It was found that no resistance to IL-2 immunotherapy was induced by pretreatment of the late tumours and that the tumours were repeatedly susceptible to local IL-2 treatment.

1448919,"Regulation of the efficiency and thermodependence of <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> MuSVts110 RNA splicing by sequences in both exons.Efficient splicing of MuSVts110 RNA is restricted to temperatures of 33 degrees or lower. Previously, we have shown that this conditional splicing event is mediated, in part, by cis-acting intronic sequences. We have now examined the role of exon sequences in MuSVts110 RNA splicing. We found that deletion of all but 36 nucleotides of the gag exon (E1) yielded a transcript incapable of supporting splicing. However, inefficient, growth temperature-dependent splicing was recovered after restoration of the 300 nucleotides of E1 proximal to the 5' splice site (5' ss). Increasingly efficient splicing was observed as more E1 was restored. Hence, although MuSVts110 E1 sequences were required for splicing, they were not involved in its thermodependence. Similarly, removal of all but 88 nucleotides of the mos exon (E2) abolished splicing at the usual 3' splice site (3' ss). In contrast to E1, restoration of the 200 nucleotides of E2 adjacent to the 3' ss reactivated efficient, temperature-independent splicing. Thermodependent splicing, however, reappeared with the replacement of E2 sequences located more than 400 nucleotides distal to the 3' splice site. In MuSVts110 mutants containing the minimum amounts of both E1 and E2 which would support splicing, splicing was both far more efficient than predicted and temperature-independent, suggesting that cooperation between E1 and E2 may help to regulate MuSVts110 splicing.",M2

The Mos protein was found to exist in these cells as a phosphoprotein, pp39Mos, and, when immunoprecipitated with an antiserum specific for the Mos N-terminus [anti-Mos(6-24)], had autophosphorylating kinase activity.

Previously, by direct sequencing of MuSVts110 RNA transcribed in 6m2 cells, we established that the thermosensitive RNA splicing phenotype uniquely characteristic of MuSVts110 results from a deletion of 1,487 nucleotides of progenitor MuSV-124 sequences. As anticipated, the sequence obtained in this study contained precisely this same deletion. In addition, several other unexpected sequence differences were found between MuSVts110 and MuSV-124. For example, in the noncoding region upstream of the gag gene, MuSVts110 DNA contained a 52-nucleotide tract typical of murine leukemia virus rather than MuSV-124, suggesting that MuSVts110 originated as a MuSV-helper murine leukemia virus recombinant during reverse transcription rather than from a straightforward deletion within MuSV-124. In addition, both MuSVts110 long terminal repeats contained head-to-tail duplications of eight nucleotides in the U3 region. Finally, seven single-nucleotide substitutions were found scattered throughout MuSVts110 DNA. Three of the nucleotide substitutions were in the gag gene, resulting in one coding change in p15 and one in p30. All of the remaining nucleotide changes were found in the noncoding region between the 5' long terminal repeat and the gag gene. In NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the cloned MuSVts110 DNA, the pattern of viral RNA expression conformed with that observed in cells infected with authentic MuSVts110 virus in that viral RNA splicing was 30 to 40% efficient at growth temperatures between 28 and 33 degrees C but reduced to trace levels above 37 degrees C.",M2

The replacement of the native promoter with the viral enhancer-promoter increased the enzymatic activity of APRT two- to threefold. Addition of sodium butyrate (NaBu) to the cell growth medium induced APRT activity ten- to 20-fold above wild-type levels in both transient and stable transfectants. The introduction of the APRT native promoter between the MoMSV enhancer-promoter and structural gene reduced the magnitude of the NaBu response. The bacterial cat gene was also stimulated by NaBu when linked to the viral enhancer-promoter. No NaBu response was found in constructs lacking the MoMSV enhancer region. Northern analysis and nuclear run-on experiments indicated that NaBu enhanced transcription of APRT mRNA in both transiently and stably transfected cells, but not in cells inhibited by cycloheximide. Thus, a butyrate-response element (BRE) is associated with the MoMSV enhancer and the action of the MoMSV BRE is promoter-dependent.",M2
1370458,"Molecular cloning and characterization of v-mos-activated transformation-associated proteins.Using monoclonal antibodies we previously detected two forms of transformation-associated proteins, a 64-kDa protein and a 68-kDa protein, in temperature-sensitive 110-Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-mutant-transformed rat kidney 6m2 cells. The identity and functions of the transformation-associated proteins were previously unknown. By molecular cloning techniques and immunoscreening, we have isolated two cDNA clones (34A and 79B3) that were found by Western blot analysis to code for a monoclonal anti-transformation-associated protein antibody-reactive polypeptide of approximately 58 kDa. Limited restriction enzyme mapping indicated 34A and 79B3 are two different cDNA clones. The nucleotide sequence of 34A cDNA was determined, and a search of GenBank revealed that it is identical to that of rat transin-2. The deduced amino acid sequence of 34A shares 71% sequence identity with rat transin and 41-76% identity with six human metalloproteinases. The limited restriction enzyme mapping and partial nucleotide sequencing data indicated that 79B3 may be the rat transin gene. When either 34A cDNA or 79B3 cDNA was used as a probe in Northern blot analysis, one mRNA band of approximately 1.9 kilobases was detected in 6m2 cells grown at the permissive temperature of 33 degrees C, at which the cells exhibited transformation properties, and a much lower level in 6m2 cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature of 39 degrees C, at which the cells reverted to normal phenotypes. These results suggest that at 39 degrees C, these two genes were not transcribed at the same level as at 33 degrees C. Zymogram and Western blot analysis of 6m2 cells further confirmed that the 64- and 68-kDa proteins have metalloproteinase activities and that the synthesis of metalloproteinases was also temperature-sensitive. Apparently, the two proteins we formerly designated transformation-associated proteins are members of the rat transin gene family. Therefore, within v-mos transformed 6m2 cells, the absence of transformation-associated protein (metalloproteinase) synthesis at the nonpermissive temperature was due to the absence of transcription of two rat transin genes.",M2
1735735,"Tumours induced by Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> are clonal in rats, not clonal in mice.Moloney murine sarcoma virus (M-MSV) induces rapidly growing tumours in adult mice of most conventional strains. Rats are less susceptible to M-MSV oncogenesis, but the few rhabdomyosarcomas that do develop after viral inoculation of newborn animals closely resemble conventional malignancies: they develop after a long latency, grow progressively, and metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lungs. Southern blot analysis with a v-mos-specific probe of M-MSV-induced tumours in both species demonstrated an oligo-, monoclonal pattern of exogenous v-mos integration only in the rat system, while mouse tumours were not clonal in origin. Furthermore, the same type of analysis of lymph node and lung metastases showed that cell clones already present in the primary rat lesion colonized secondary sites during tumour progression. Apparently, Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) was not involved in rhabdomyosarcoma pathogenesis since M-MuLV-specific DNA sequences could not be demonstrated in three of the six rat tumours. Finally, in all mouse tumours, unintegrated linear M-MSV proviruses could be readily detected.",M2
1602817,"Overproduction of metalloproteinases by v-mos-transformed rat kidney (6m2) cells.Using monoclonal antibodies, we previously detected two forms of transformation-associated proteins (TAPs), P64 and P68, in the rat kidney (6m2) cells transformed by the temperature-sensitive 110-<e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-Moloney-mutant. TAPs were secreted as glycoproteins by 6m2 cells grown at 33 degrees C, but not by 6m2 cells grown at 39 degrees C. The identity and functions of TAPs were previously unknown. By molecular cloning techniques and immunoscreening, we have isolated two different cDNA clones (34A and 79B3) that were found by Western blot analysis to code for an anti-TAP monoclonal antibody-reactive polypeptide of approximately 58,000 daltons. The nucleotide sequence of 34A cDNA was determined and found to be identical to that of rat transin-2. The deduced amino acid sequence of 34A shares 71% sequence identity with rat transin and 41% to 76% identity with three human metalloproteinases. Partial nucleotide sequencing data indicated that 79B3 may be the rat transin gene. When either 34A cDNA or 79B3-cDNA was used as a probe in Northern blot analysis, one mRNA band of approximately 1.9 kb was detected in 6m2 cells at the permissive temperature of 33 degrees C. Similar RNA was either not detected or detected at very low level in 6m2 cells grown at the non-permissive 39 degrees C. These results suggest that at the non-permissive 39 degrees C, these two genes were not transcribed at the same level as that at 33 degrees C. Zymogram further confirmed that P64 and P68 have metalloproteinase activities. Apparently, the two proteins which we formerly designated TAPs are members of the rat transin gene family. Therefore, within v-mos transformed 6m2 cells, the absence of TAPs (metalloproteinases) at the non-permissive temperature was due to the very poor transcription of the two rat transin genes. This article presents a review of the biochemical properties of TAPs and their eventual identification as rat transin-2 and transin.",M2
1385341,"Role of adhesion molecules in the immune reaction to M-MSV-induced tumors.We have investigated the in vivo role of 2 different adhesion molecules, LFA-1 and LECAM-1, in the immune reaction to Moloney-<e>murine-sarcoma-virus</e>(M-MSV)-induced tumors, which undergo a peculiar spontaneous regression due to generation of a strong virus-specific cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte(CTL) response. Repeated administration of anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibody (FD441.8 MAb), i.p. or at the site of virus inoculation, enhanced tumor growth and delayed regression, while i.p. administration of anti-LECAM-1 MEL-14 MAb gave rise to tumors that grew progressively and caused host death. Evaluation of the immunological response in MAb-treated mice showed reduced generation of virus-specific CTL precursors (p) in the spleen of animals given FD441.8 MAb i.p.; CTLp frequency in locally treated mice overlapped with that of control mice injected with virus only. FD441.8 MAb treatment did not interfere with CTL homing in the tumor, since the frequency of M-MSV-specific CTLps in sarcomas was similar in treated and control mice. Cytofluorimetric analysis indicated that the majority of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from MAb-treated mice were covered by anti-LFA-1 MAb, and lacked cytotoxic activity when assayed against target cells bearing relevant tumor antigens. Instead, in mice injected i.p. with MEL-14 MAb, a very low frequency of CTLps was detected in lymph nodes draining the tumor area, and within the tumor. Our results indicate that enhanced tumor growth, depending on the MAb used, is the resultant of an inhibitory effect on different T-lymphocyte functions. Tumor progression in anti-LFA-1 MAb-injected mice is explained mostly by blockage of CTL lytic activity at the tumor site; in mice receiving i.p. MEL-14 MAb treatment, by the failure of naive T lymphocytes to enter peripheral lymph nodes and subsequently by the lack of generation of tumor-specific CTLs.",M2
1377009,"Karyotype instability and altered differentiation of rat sarcoma cells after retroviral infection.The karyotypic and phenotypic stability of cultured rat fibrosarcoma cells was challenged by infection with Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MoMuSV). After transformation, the spindle-like morphology of the parental HH-16 cl.2/1 cells had altered to a rounded phenotype, which was maintained in tumors produced by inoculating transformed cells into congenic animals. In contrast to the parental cells, transformed cells lacked cables of cytokeratins 14-16 and 19 and showed reduction of the mesenchymal marker protein vimentin. Additionally, the morphologically altered cell clones tf-1 to tf-3 had lost growth arrest in the presence of dexamethasone. The DNA of the transformed cells contained between four and six randomly integrated proviral copies. Karyotypic alterations were manifested by reduction of morphologically intact chromosomes in the MoMuSV-transformed cells together with increase of structural aberrations. Three additional markers were identified in the virus-transformed cell clones. Karyotypic instability induced by MoMuSV infection appeared closely related to reduction of the cellular differentiation status, although only cells of clone tf-1 had increased metastatic potential.",M2
1373025,"Midline brain tumors in MSV-SV 40-transgenic mice originate from the pineal organ.Adult transgenic mice expressing the large T-antigen of the Simian virus 40 (SV 40) under the control of the Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV) enhancer and the SV 40 promoter develop inheritable uniform midline brain neoplasms showing features of primitive neuroectodermal tumors. The origin and histogenesis of these tumors were investigated in the present study. The brain and pineal organ of fetal and young transgenic mice less than 3 months old displayed normal macroscopic and microscopic features. In 3.5-month-old animals, the pineal organ was considerably enlarged due to hyperplasia, finally leading to tumor formation. Immunocytochemical demonstration of large T-antigen showed that this oncoprotein was already expressed in the nuclei of certain cells in the pineal organ of fetuses (16 and 18 days old) and newborn animals, but was absent from all other parts of the brain. The immunocytochemical demonstration of S-antigen (arrestin), a highly characteristic marker for pinealocytes, was used for further characterization of the large T-antigen-immunoreactive cells. The fetal pineal organ did not contain immunoreactive S-antigen. This first occurred in certain pinealocytes of newborn mice. Double immunostaining revealed that in newborn and older transgenic mice the immunoreactive large T-antigen was exclusively found in nuclei of cells containing S-antigen immunoreaction in their cytoplasm. Thus, transformed pinealocytes appear as stem cells of the experimental tumors. The results of this study suggest that primitive neuroectodermal tumors and the normal tissue from which they originate share certain molecular and immunocytochemical features.",M2
1833453,"Moloney murine leukemia virus tolerance in anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody-treated adult mice.Adult mice injected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) 1 day after a short term treatment with anti-CD4 mAb developed T cell lymphomas, or sarcomas when rechallenged with Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (M-MSV). Neoplastic development was correlated with virus spread, as thymic and peripheral T and B lymphocytes promptly expressed M-MuLV-induced Ag after virus introduction; no virus-specific CTL generation was detected in MLTC. This failure, which was selective for M-MuLV-induced Ag, persisted throughout the life span of the mice, and was not sustained by suppressor cell activity. The frequencies of splenic virus-specific CTL precursor varied in relation to time after virus injection; in the first postinjection month, frequencies were similar to those in nonimmune control mice, while at 4 mo post-virus exposure, they showed a striking reduction. These findings indicate that a transient functional impairment of CD4+ cells at the time of retrovirus injection provided the appropriate milieu for tolerance induction in both the peripheral mature and intrathymic T cell compartments.",M2

We have now investigated the effects of different PMEA and PMEDAP treatment schedules in newborn mice infected with Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV). Administration of a single dose of PMEA or PMEDAP on the day of MSV inoculation conferred a greater protective effect against MSV-induced tumor formation than when this dose was divided over two, four or seven injections per week. Also, the therapeutic index of PMEA and PMEDAP was increased if administered as a single dose. Furthermore, PMEA and PMEDAP afforded a marked antiviral protection if administered within one day before MSV infection. Thus, single doses of PMEA or PMEDAP, when administered shortly before or after MSV infection, appear to be effective in preventing the manifestations of the retroviral disease.",M2
1833309,"Production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody to the v-mos oncogene protein.Valuable information about proto-oncogenes and their physiological functions has been obtained by studying their expression in normal cells. However, the protein product of the c-mos gene, the cellular homologue of the transforming gene (v-mos) of Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>, has not been detected in normal mouse cells or tissues. Here, we have constructed a v-mos expression vector, pRI-delta mos, which directs the synthesis of a truncated v-mos gene product, a protein A fusion protein. Using the truncated v-mos oncoprotein produced in Escherichia coli as immunogen, we prepared anti-v-mos monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). In immunoblotting assays, the MAb was reactive with v-mos oncoprotein and detected bands at 43 KDa or 39 kDa in the tissue extract of mouse testes or ovaries, respectively, in which the c-mos protooncogene mRNA is expressed. These results demonstrate that the v-mos MAb obtained is suitable for elucidating the physiological functions of v-mos gene product and may also be utilized to detect c-mos gene product at the cellular level.",M2
2039698,"In vitro differentiation of rhabdomyosarcomas induced by nickel or by Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>.In vitro cultures and clonal derivatives have been established from rat rhabdomyosarcomas induced by Moloney-Murine Sarcoma Virus (MSV) or by nickel sulfide; differentiation ability has been studied as expression of desmin, embryonic and adult myosin isoforms, alpha-actin isoforms and cellular fusion. The two rhabdomyosarcoma models showed different levels of myogenic differentiation. Multinucleated myotube-like structures were frequently observed in cultures derived from nickel-induced tumours. Desmin was present in 50-80% of cells and embryonic myosin in up to 10%. In MSV-tumour-derived cultures and in their metastases or clonal derivatives two cell types are present in different ratios: spindle-shaped cells, adherent to plastic surfaces, and rounded cells, loosely attached or floating free in the medium. These cultures showed features of myogenic differentiation (10-80% desmin-positive cells), but embryonic myosin expression and production of multinucleated myotube-like structures were very rare events. Cultures from autochthonous lymph node and lung metastatic cells showed similar patterns of differentiation. Retinoic acid increased differentiated features (myotube formation and embryonic myosin expression) only in nickel-induced rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The two models described here mimic the heterogeneity in differentiation pattern found among human rhabdomyosarcomas. Myogenic differentiation ability was retained at a good level by nickel-induced tumours, whereas it was strongly impaired in MSV-induced tumours.",M2
1848307,"Derivatives of Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> capable of being transcribed in embryonal carcinoma stem cells have gained a functional Sp1 binding site.The long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences of Moloney murine leukemia virus and its closely related derivative Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MSV) are incapable of directing transcription in embryonal carcinoma (EC) stem cells. The myeloproliferative sarcoma virus, a derivative of Mo-MSV, has several point mutations in the LTR and is transcribed more efficiently to allow productive infection of F9 EC cells. One of these mutations, at -166 with respect to the transcriptional start, creates a consensus binding site for the well-characterized mammalian transcription factor Sp1. We used gel retardation assays to demonstrate that F9 EC cell extracts form several complexes with the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus sequence around -166. One of these complexes involves a murine Sp1-like protein, which has immunoreactivity, DNA binding specificity, and electrophoretic mobility equivalent to those of purified human Sp1 protein. An equivalent complex forms on the corresponding Mo-MSV sequence but with a fivefold-lower affinity. Consistent with these observations, introduction of the single point mutation at -166 into the Mo-MSV LTR, creating a consensus Sp1 binding site, increases expression in F9 EC cells sixfold.",M2
1651251,"Eye pathology in transgenic mice carrying a MSV-SV 40 large T-construct.Several lines of transgenic mice carrying a transgene construct consisting of the regulatory enhancer element of the Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> and the Simian virus 40 genome coding for the SV 40 promoter and the large T antigen were established. We describe several abnormalities found in the eyes of transgenic animals of which heritable cataract formation, probably due to disturbances in primary lens fibre differentiation, showed a close correlation to large T antigen expression. Additionally, lenticonus anterior, retinal dysplasia and one case of malignant transformation of lens epithelium were found. The introduction of the deleted MSV-enhancer linked to the large T coding region led to less severe postnatally occurring cataracts. Thus, the partial deletion of the MSV enhancer resulted in differences in the degree of severity of lens disturbances. However, tissue specificity remained constant. Our results indicate that large T antigen seems to play an important role in cataract formation but not in the pathogenesis of retinal dysplasia.",M2
2148370,"Elevated expression of v-mos is correlated with altered differentiation of carcinoma cells.Permanent alterations of the epithelial differentiation pattern were investigated after infection of HH-16 cl. 4 adenocarcinoma cells with Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MoMuSV). Transformed cell clones with fibroblastoid morphology were isolated and compared with clones of unchanged epithelioid phenotype. Southern blot analyses showed intact MoMuSV proviral genomes in copy numbers between 4 and 9 in the DNA of the morphologically transformed cell clones as well as in the clones with unaltered morphology. The fibroblastoid cells produced sarcomas after inoculation of newborn rats, whereas MoMuSV-infected cell clones with unaltered epithelioid morphology yielded adenocarcinomas. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed that morphological transformation into the fibroblastoid phenotype was accompanied by loss of cytokeratin expression and appearance of the mesenchymal marker protein vimentin. Proviral DNA was transcribed in the infected cell clones irrespective of their phenotype; however, transcription was significantly higher in cells with fibroblastoid morphology than in epithelioid cells.",M2
2384280,"Anti-retrovirus activity of 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) in vivo increases when it is less frequently administered.Different treatment schedules have been investigated when evaluating the inhibitory effect of 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) and 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) on the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) in MT-4 cells, transformation of C3H/3T3 cells by Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV), and MSV-induced tumor formation in newborn NMRI mice. Shortening the exposure time of HIV-I-infected MT-4 cells to PMEA or AZT led to an increase in the selectivity index of both compounds. PMEA proved markedly more efficient in suppressing MSV-induced tumor formation in mice when administered as a single dose on the day of infection than when these doses were spread over 2, 4 or 7 administrations within 1 week after the virus infection. This was not observed when the total dose of AZT was fractionated. While the infrequent dosage regimen increased the anti-retrovirus activity of PMEA, it did not increase its toxicity for the host. This unique property makes PMEA an attractive candidate for the treatment of retrovirus infections, including AIDS.",M2

Even at a dose as low as 1 mg/kg/day, PMEA effected a significant delay in tumor formation. When evaluated in parallel with PMEA, 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) conferred a comparable tumor-inhibitory effect at a 5- to 10-fold higher dose than PMEA. Prolonged treatment of MSV-infected mice with PMEA resulted in long-term survivors without apparent signs of tumor development. In view of the propensity of HIV to spread to the central nervous system (CNS), the marked activity shown by PMEA against experimental retrovirus infection of the brain in mice points to its potential in the treatment of AIDS and other retrovirus infections of the CNS.",M2

They are also inhibitory to the transformation of C3H/3T3 cells by Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV). In vivo, they are only marginally effective in delaying MSV-induced tumor formation, and mortality associated therewith in newborn NMRI mice. When combined with ribavirin, DDI and ddDAPR become much more effective in inhibiting MSV and HIV replication in vitro and MSV-induced tumor formation in vivo. These observations point to the potential role of ribavirin in potentiating the anti-HIV activity of DDI in AIDS patients.",M2
2754698,"Synthesis and antiviral activity of 3'-C-cyano-3'-deoxynucleosides.A series of 3'-C-cyano-3'-deoxynucleosides have been synthesized and evaluated as antiviral agents. Reaction of 2',5'-bis-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranos- 3'-ulosyl derivatives of uracil, 4-N-acetylcytosine, and adenine with sodium cyanide gave a mixture of epimeric cyanohydrins, which after 3'-deoxygenation yielded the corresponding 3'-C-cyano-3'-deoxy-beta-D-xylo-pentofuranosyl derivatives 10. These compounds were epimerized to the corresponding beta-D-ribo-pentofuranosyl derivatives 11. Desilylation of 10 and 11 gave the deprotected 3'-C-cyano-3'-deoxy-beta-D-xylo- and -ribo-pentofuranosyl nucleosides. These derivatives of uridine, cytidine, and adenine, as well as the 3'-C-cyano-3'-deoxy-beta-D-xylo- and -ribo-pentofuranosyl, 3'-C-cyano-2',3'-dideoxy-beta-D-threo- and -erythro-pentofuranosyl, and 3'-C-cyano-2',3'-dideoxy-beta-D-glycero-pent-2'-enofuranosyl derivatives of thymine, were evaluated for their antiviral activity. None of the compounds proved active against the replication of retroviruses (human immunodeficiency virus, <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>) at concentrations that were not toxic to the host cells. However, the 3'-C-cyano-3'-deoxy-beta-D-xylo- (12e) and -ribo-pentofuranosyl (13e) derivatives of adenine showed activity against some DNA (i.e., vaccinia) and RNA (i.e., Sindbis, Semliki forest) viruses at concentrations well below the cytotoxicity threshold.",M2
2521813,"Presence of a constitutive paracrine beta-interferon in v-mos-bearing nonmalignant reverted cells.A stable nonmalignant revertant cell line was derived from Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-transformed BALB/c cells after long-term cultivation in the presence of murine type I interferon (IFN). These cells gradually established resistance to exogenous IFN and were also seen to contain IFN-dependent proteins. The presence of an endogenous IFN was confirmed by the results of Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization with an IFN-beta probe, showing that only mRNA specific for IFN-beta- could be found in the uninduced reverted cells. The latter synthesized only a small amount of IFN-beta protein and exhibited few IFN-specific membrane receptors, which bound recombinant IFN-beta with a high affinity. After treatment with IFN antibody, the overexpression of H-2 major histocompatibility antigen genes was significantly down-regulated. These findings strongly suggest the existence in this reverted cell line of a constitutive IFN which, acting through an autocrine and/or paracrine mechanism, might play a role in maintaining the reverted state.",M2
2493000,"Expression of NF-L and NF-M in fibroblasts reveals coassembly of neurofilament and vimentin subunits.We have used transient and stable DNA transfection to force synthesis of the mouse NF-L and NF-M genes in nonneuronal cultured animal cells. When the authentic NF-L gene (containing 1.7 kb of sequences 5' to the transcription initiation site) was transfected into L cells, correctly initiated NF-L mRNA was produced from the transfected gene but not the endogenous NF-L genes. Therefore, the normal restriction of NF-L expression to neurons cannot derive exclusively from absence in nonneuronal cells of neuron-specific transcription factors. When the NF-L coding region was linked to the strong promoter from Moloney <e>Murine Sarcoma virus</e>, we obtained high levels of synthesis of NF-L subunits (accumulating to as much as 9% of cell protein in stable cell lines). Although NF-L and NF-M polypeptides are normally expressed exclusively in postmitotic neurons, NF-L or NF-M polypeptides expressed in fibroblasts were efficiently assembled into intermediate filament arrays, thus demonstrating the competence of both NF-L and NF-M to assemble in vivo in the absence of additional neuron-specific factors. As judged by immunofluorescence localization and by the alteration in the solubility of the endogenous vimentin filaments, filaments containing NF-L appeared to be copolymers with vimentin. Neither the alteration in the properties of the vimentin array nor the accumulation of NF-L to a level that made it the second most abundant cellular protein (after actin) had any observable effect on cell viability or growth rate.",M2
2911579,"Marked in vivo antiretrovirus activity of 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine, a selective anti-human immunodeficiency virus agent.9-(2-Phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro in human T-lymphocyte MT-4, H9, and ATH8 cells. PMEA also inhibits Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (Mo-MSV)-induced transformation of murine C3H embryo fibroblasts. Moreover, PMEA causes a dose-dependent suppression of tumor formation and associated mortality in mice inoculated with Mo-MSV. At a dose of 50 or 20 mg/kg per day PMEA effected a 90-100% protection of the mice against Mo-MSV-induced tumor formation and mortality. Even with a PMEA dose as low as 1 to 5 mg/kg per day, tumor formation was significantly delayed and the survival rate was significantly enhanced. In parallel experiments, azidothymidine exhibited a comparable inhibitory effect on Mo-MSV-induced tumor formation and associated death only at a 25-fold higher dose than PMEA. Because PMEA has stronger in vivo antiretrovirus potency and selectivity than azidothymidine and various other compounds currently being subjected to clinical trials, PMEA studies should be pursued to assess the potential of this compound in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other retrovirus infections in humans.",M2

An RSV-transformed clone (S814-2) isolated from B814 cells shows temperature-sensitive transformed phenotypes for morphology, growth in soft agar, and glucose uptake. The expression, phosphorylation, and tyrosine kinase activity of pp60v-src in S814-2 were not affected at the nonpermissive temperature, and virus rescued from this clone had wild-type transforming ability, suggesting that a cellular factor altered in S814-2 is responsible for the cellular steps of transformation after the function of pp60v-src. In addition, the cellular 36K protein, a possible candidate as a target of pp60v-src, was phosphorylated at the nonpermissive temperature in S814-2, indicating that phosphorylation of the 36K protein is not correlated with transformed phenotypes.",M2
3141331,"Effect of recombinant human interleukin 2 on the growth of a BALB/c sarcoma induced by Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>.The effect of in vivo administration of recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL2) on the growth of a primary female BALB/c sarcoma induced by Moloney murine sarcoma virus (M-MSV) was studied. Although low-dose administration of (6,000 JU/mouse x 14 days) rIL2 had no effect on the growth of the tumors, high-dose (15,000-80,000 JU/mouse x 14 days) intraperitoneal inoculation of rIL2 induced tumor regression, dose-dependently. Tumors in mice which received 80,000 JU/mouse/day of rIL2 regressed completely 2 weeks after the initiation of treatment. The survival rates of the treated groups were significantly higher than those of the control group. A time course experiment disclosed that the effect of rIL2 was restricted only to the group in which rIL2 treatment started 8 days after the inoculation of M-MSV. The cytotoxic activity of regional lymph node lymphocytes from rIL2-treated mice was demonstrated against primary culture of M-MSV-induced sarcoma but not against syngeneic tumor induced by methylcholanthrene (Meth A). The effect of rIL2 was partially blocked by the administration of anti-IL2 receptor antibody. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that infiltration of Thy1.2+Lyt1+2- (helper/inducer subset) lymphocytes into the tumor tissue was prominent in mice which received high-dose rIL2. The results indicated that IL2 induced regression of M-MSV-induced sarcoma mainly through activation of IL2-receptor-positive helper T cells in the tumor tissues and of killer cells in the draining lymph nodes.",M2
2836147,"Construction and characterization of a retroviral vector demonstrating efficient expression of cloned cDNA sequences.We describe the construction and properties of a retroviral expression vector, designated pMV-7, designed to transfer unselected cDNAs and produce their encoded proteins in recipient cells. The vector is flanked by the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of the Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV) and contains the selectable drug resistance gene neo under the regulation of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (tk) promoter. Unique Eco RI and Hind III sites facilitate the introduction of sequences whose transcription is regulated by the 5' LTR. We have inserted cDNAs encoding: (i) the human lymphocyte antigen T4, (ii) the human lymphocyte antigen T8, and (iii) the murine hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), into the pMV-7 vector. These constructions were used to transduce recipient cells to the neo+ phenotype. In each case, functional assays demonstrated that 65-92% of the neo+ clones produced the appropriate protein encoded by its corresponding cDNA. These clones were characterized further by analyzing the expression of vector-regulated transcripts. The neo+T4+ clones expressed a single full-length LTR-to-LTR transcript as detected by a T4 probe. The neo+T8+ clones, however, expressed both a full-length LTR-to-LTR transcript and an additional smaller transcript as detected by a T8 probe. This smaller transcript probably resulted from the utilization of cryptic signals which control 3' RNA processing. Furthermore, all of the neo+ clones expressed a transcript that initiated from the tk promoter, contained the neo gene, and used polyadenylation signals provided by the 3' LTR. Thus, the pMV-7 vector is capable of high-efficiency transfer and high-frequency expression of the cDNA-encoded protein.",M2
3372178,"Uptake of cadmium-109, a metallothionein-binding radiometal, by tumors in mice as a function of the transformed phenotype.Metallothionein (MT) is an intracellular protein that binds many metals with isotopes having imaging or radiotherapeutic potential. To determine whether uptake of radioisotopes that bind to MT is increased in tumors, we measured the uptake of cadmium-109 (Cd-109) in tumors and in normal tissues of mice. Tumors were grown in Balb/C mice from cultured Balb/3T3 cells transformed by the Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MMSV). Uptake of Cd-109 by MMSV tumors exceeded that by normal tissues examined, with the exception of liver and kidney (the organs known to be richest in metallothionein). The MMSV tumor:background ratios of activity were greater for Cd-109 than for gallium-67 for many of the normal tissues examined. The magnitude of uptake of Cd-109 by tumors from four related cell lines paralleled their degree of expression of two indices of the transformed, or malignant, phenotype. We conclude that metals that bind to MT may be useful for imaging or radiotherapy of cancer.",M2
2830886,"The in vitro and in vivo anti-retrovirus activity, and intracellular metabolism of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine are highly dependent on the cell species.Cell lines derived from different species show striking differences in their sensitivity to the cytostatic and anti-retrovirus activity, as well as the intracellular metabolism, of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AzddThd) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddCyd). AzddThd and ddCyd are considerably more cytostatic to human (i.e. Raji, Molt/4F, ATH8) cell lines than murine (i.e. L1210) cells. The intracellular levels of AzddThd 5'-triphosphate and ddCyd 5'-triphosphate formed do not seem related to the cytostatic effects achieved by these compounds. In human lymphoid (ATH8, Molt/4F) and caprine ovary (Tahr) cells AzddThd accumulates as its 5'-monophosphate (AzddTMP), whereas in murine leukemia (L1210) cells it is readily metabolized to the 5'-triphosphate (AzddTTP). The rapid conversion of AzddThd to AzddTTP in murine cells may explain why AzddThd has a pronounced activity against Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV)-induced transformation of murine C3H cells in vitro and MSV-induced tumor development in newborn NMRI mice in vivo. In contrast, ddCyd has not much activity in these murine assay systems, and this may seem related to the poor conversion of ddCyd to its 5'-triphosphate in murine cells. In human cells, however, ddCyd is more extensively phosphorylated to its 5'-triphosphate than in murine cells. When [3H]AzddThd and [3H]ddCyd were compared for their metabolism in ATH8 and Molt/4F cells, little [3H]AzddTTP was formed even after a 48-hr incubation period, whereas under the same conditions substantial levels of [3H]ddCTP built up gradually. Thus, much higher ddCTP than AzddTTP levels were achieved in human lymphoid cells, an observation that may be particularly relevant from a therapeutic viewpoint.",M2
3322940,"Defects in lens fiber differentiation are linked to c-mos overexpression in transgenic mice.We describe three strains of transgenic mice derived by embryo microinjection of DNA consisting of a long terminal repeat (LTR) of Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (Mo-MSV) linked to the murine c-mos coding sequences. Southern analysis of the genomic DNA of these strains suggested that in each case the transgene had integrated at a different chromosomal location. The strains were characterized by dominant changes in secondary lens fiber differentiation. Shortly after birth, insufficient elongation of differentiating lens fibers and lack of basement membrane secretion resulted in breakdown of the posterior lens capsule. This, in turn led to posterior protrusion and swelling of lens tissue. In the course of the first 3 weeks after birth, globular lens cells began to fill the entire anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. Concomitantly, there was massive overexpression of c-mos RNA in the lens. Whereas this construct has high transforming activity when transfected into NIH-3T3 cells, no hyperplasia or neoplasia have been observed in the affected lenses. Increased expression of c-mos RNA was not confined to the lens of the eye but has been detected in any of several tissues tested.",M2
2820404,"Rat transformation-associated proteins (TAP) induced by Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> interact with specific receptors on normal rat kidney cells.In this report, data are presented to show that transformation-associated proteins (TAP) secreted from the transformed 6M2 cells have mitogenic activities in the stimulation of DNA synthesis and proliferation of normal rat kidney (NRK-2) cells and of nonpermissively grown 6M2 cells. TAP also bound specifically to NRK-2 cells with a binding dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.4 pM. Approximately 2 X 10(5) binding sites per cell were found. Therefore, TAP may represent a set of virally-induced growth stimulatory factors.",M2
3598563,"Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus induces anti-Golgi apparatus antibodies.A recently described autoantibody-inducing agent in mice was further characterized. Tentatively designated AGIA (anti-Golgi apparatus-inducing agent), this agent has previously been shown to cause antibody production against Golgi apparatus (GA) antigen of cells from different vertebrate species as well as against tumour surface antigen of the Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-non-producer transformant Sac. It was shown to possess the properties characteristic of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV). It induced elevation of lactate dehydrogenase levels in the blood, persistent lifelong viraemia in mice and serum titres of up to 10(11) infectious doses (ID50) per ml in the acute phase of infection. Its replication in vitro was limited to subpopulations of murine peritoneal macrophages. Electron microscopy of AGIA-infected macrophages and of serum of infected mice revealed virus-like particles with a morphology resembling LDV. The buoyant density of AGIA was approximately 1.14 g/ml. Both the enzyme-elevating activity and the autoantibody-inducing activity were shown to belong to LDV. Infection of STU mice with two established strains of LDV (LDVROW and LDVPLA) was also found to induce both autoantibody groups. In both cases, after infection with AGIA as well as after infection with the two known LDV isolates, anti-Sac cell antibodies occurred at comparable titres. However, anti-GA antibody titres were rather low after infection with LDVROW and LDVPLA compared with AGIA infection. Serological cross-reactivity was demonstrated between AGIA-, LDVROW- and LDVPLA-infected macrophages. AGIA induced anti-GA antibodies in all six mouse strains tested (STU, DBA/2, BALB/c, C3H/He, NMRI, C57BL/6); however, anti-Sac cell antibodies did not develop in C57BL/6 mice.",M2
2437947,"Temporary inhibition of Moloney-<e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (M-MSV) induced-tumours by adoptive transfer of ricin-treated T-lymphocytes.The potential use of tumour-specific T-lymphocytes loaded with ricin in cell targeting experiments was investigated. Moloney-murine sarcoma virus (M-MSV)-specific T-lymphocytes, obtained in mass mixed leucocyte-tumour cell culture (MLTC) and a M-MSV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone, were incubated with 125I-labelled ricin in order to evaluate toxin uptake and release. The internalized ricin (4.5 X 10(-17) mol and 6.5 X 10(-17) mol per 10(2) MLTC and CTL clone cells, respectively) was released rapidly during the first 30 min following treatment, and at a constant but slower rate over the next few hours. The cytotoxic activity of ricin-treated cells evaluated against antigen-related target cells, in a short term incubation 51Cr release assay, was unaffected during the first 30 min after treatment but decreased with time over the next few hours. However, the growth of antigen related as well as of unrelated tumour cells was strongly inhibited by the addition of ricin-treated cells to the culture system, thus indicating that released ricin is toxic for untreated target cells. The in vivo localization pattern of ricin-treated radiolabelled MLTC cells was found to be comparable with that of untreated cells 1 h after i.v. injection into syngeneic sublethally irradiated mice. After 6 h, however, more radiolabel was recovered from the liver of mice receiving ricin-treated MLTC cells. Ricin-treated M-MSV-specific T-lymphocytes were injected i.v. into tumour bearing sublethally irradiated mice. A temporary tumour growth inhibition (up to 6 days) was achieved following transfer of low doses of ricin-treated MLTC or CTL clone cells (1 X 10(6) and 0.5 X 10(6), respectively). In contrast, in M-MSV injected control mice, receiving only free toxin (from 5 to 20 ng) or untreated tumour-specific effector cell tumours grew progressively. The therapeutic effect was apparently specific since the injection of ricin-treated alloreactive T-lymphocytes did not influence tumour growth. These results suggest that M-MSV-specific T-lymphocytes loaded with ricin can deliver toxin to the target tumour mass and have a transient therapeutic effect.",M2
3469466,"Monoclonal IgM antibodies that inhibit primary Moloney murine sarcoma growth.Monoclonal IgM antibodies with specificity for Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (M-MuSV)-Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) from two hybridoma clones have been isolated and characterized. The monoclonal antibodies have specificity for a cytoplasmic and cell surface Friend-Moloney-Rauscher group-specific antigen. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed antibody binding to the surface of virus-expressing cells but not to the budding virus particles. Treatment of M-MuSV-injected mice with monoclonal IgM anti-M-MuSV significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to virus-inoculated animals receiving either saline or MOPC 104E. Nude mice exhibited delayed tumor induction following treatment with the monoclonal antibodies but ultimately died from tumor growth. Virus-injected euthymic mice that were treated with monoclonal IgM anti-M-MuSV generated a potentiated spleen cell-mediated cytotoxicity against Moloney sarcoma cells compared to virus-infected treated with saline. This potentiation of cytotoxicity remained after trypsinization of the spleen cells and thus was probably not due to passively adsorbed monoclonal antibody. The antibodies alone or in the presence of complement did not neutralize M-MuLV. The IgM antibodies induced specific tumor cell cytotoxicity in vitro mediated by complement spleen cells, lymph node cells, or thymus cells. In conclusion, two monoclonal IgM anti-M-MuSV antibodies that bind to the tumor cell surface did not neutralize virus can inhibit primary M-MuSV-induced tumor growth in vivo. The regression event appeared to involve heterogeneous mechanisms. Complete regression remained thymus dependent even with passive antibody therapy, but significant tumor growth inhibition was produced independent of T-cells. In vitro these IgM antibodies induced complement and cell-mediated cytotoxicity.",M2
3305517,"Myosin isoform expression in rat rhabdomyosarcoma induced by Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>.Myosin isoform expression was analyzed in experimental rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and immunofluorescence techniques. Tumors induced by inoculating newborn rats with Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MSV) were examined 30-90 days after birth. Nine tumors and two lymph node metastases were studied by direct, indirect, and double immunofluorescence assays using a panel of five anti-myosin mAbs. The mAb BF-45 was specifically reactive with embryonic myosin heavy chain (MHC), mAb BF-34 was specific for a neonatal MHC epitope, mAb BF-B6 was directed against an epitope present in both embryonic and neonatal MHC, and mAbs BF-F3 and BF-32 detected epitopes present in adult MHC isoforms. Anti-desmin antibodies were also used for comparison. The results of this study show that: (1) the majority of neoplastic cells stained for desmin while only a minority of neoplastic cells were labeled by anti-myosin antibodies; (2) myosin positive tumor cells contained predominantly embryonic and neonatal MHC types but rare RMS cells reacted exclusively with anti-adult myosin antibodies; and (3) adult and embryonic MHC phenotypes were occasionally detected within the same tumor cell especially in RMS with the longest latencies. Together these results would suggest that the mechanism(s) regulating MHC gene expression in skeletal muscle cells can be altered by the transforming activity of Mo-MSV.",M2
3456070,"Ectopic hematopoiesis in peritoneal tumor nodules induced by the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus in DBA/2 mice.Tumor nodules composed of fibroblasts, large undifferentiated cells, granulocytes, and small lymphocytes develop in the spleens of adult DBA/2 mice infected with the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV). They spread thereafter in the organism, and at the terminal stage of the disease they are especially numerous on the peritoneal membrane. The present study, performed on those tumor nodules to avoid contamination by exogenous hematopoietic cells, demonstrated that they were sites of granulopoiesis, which may have occurred via the local differentiation of granulomacrophage precursor cells (GM-CFC) and perhaps also from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, since these two populations were present in the tumor nodules (25 +/- 11 and 13 +/- 10, respectively, per 5-10(5) cells). Almost all (88%) those GM-CFC were able to clone in vitro without added colony-stimulating factor. A comparative study with the Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-induced tumor indicated that the local production of hematopoiesis-stimulating factors was not sufficient to allow such ectopic granulopoiesis. These results imply the presence of a specific hematopoietic microenvironment in the MPSV-induced tumor nodules.",M2
3948758,"[Fatty acid content in the muscles and liver of mice developing sarcomas induced by 3-methylcholanthrene and Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>]A comparative analysis was made for the fatty acid composition of lipids in the malignant muscular tissue, muscle and liver under blastomogenesis induced in mice by the Moloney sarcoma virus and 3-methylcholanthrene. The relation of the found changes in the fatty acid composition to the blastomogenesis stages is shown. The development of the tumour node is accompanied by a decrease of the fatty acid amount in the animal tissues and by its increase in the tumour. A spontaneous regression of the Moloney sarcoma results in increased level of the fatty acid content in the animal tissues followed by its normalization.",M2
2946405,"Functions of the mos oncogene family and associated gene products.The mos oncogene present in Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> is one of the oldest known oncogenes, yet the identification of its biochemical function both in transformation and as a cellular proto-oncogene has been elusive. Only recently have low levels of c-mos transcripts been detected in a specific group of mouse tissues. The c-mos gene is implicated in tumorigenicity by its activation by the insertion of the intracisternal A particle genome in a mouse plasmacytoma. The murine c-mos gene is capable of oncogenic transformation when placed under the regulatory control of a long terminal repeat. The acquisition of the v-mos gene generated the transformation-competent Moloney murine sarcoma virus and several related strains. Myeloproliferative sarcoma virus is unique among the v-mos containing viruses in its ability to induce splenic foci and myeloproliferation in vivo in addition to the transformation of fibroblasts. The v-mos gene product, termed p37mos, is a cytoplasmic protein recently shown to possess serine kinase activity in immune complexes. Autophosphorylation of the mos gene product is not necessary for its biological activity as exemplified by the protein HT1-MSV which lacks phosphoserine residues. A transcriptional regulatory property has been attributed to the v-mos gene product during infection, which may play an essential role in subsequent transformation.",M2
3016522,"Differential transformation of C3H10T1/2 cells by v-mos: sequential expression of transformation parameters.Extremely small quantities of the product of the transforming gene v-mos of Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> are able to efficiently transform cells. Recent data indicate the existence of a threshold level for v-mos transformation of NIH3T3 cells. Using mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat sequences or hybrid promoters consisting of mouse mammary tumor virus and Moloney murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat elements to express v-mos in C3H10T1/2 cells, we established cell lines representing different stages of morphological transformation in vitro. The threshold level for v-mos transformation was considerably lower than that for NIH3T3 cells, because no treatment with dexamethasone or primary selection other than transformation was necessary during standard transfection procedures. Using the cell lines mentioned we established an association of the level of v-mos expression with the transformation parameters examined, but not with p53 levels. Furthermore, the characterization of the different promoters showed (i) that the distal binding site confers hormone responsiveness to Moloney murine sarcoma virus promoter elements and (ii) that artifactual transcription initiation sites can be detected in mouse mammary tumor virus-Moloney murine sarcoma virus hybrid promoters which are, however, not regulated by the hormone.",M2
3891902,"Characterization of gP85gag as an antigen recognized by Moloney leukemia virus-specific cytolytic T cell clones that function in vivo.The gag membrane protein gP85gag, encoded by Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV), was identified as a target molecule recognized by Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>--M-MLV (M-MSV--M-MLV)-specific cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones. Target cells infected with Ab-X-MLV, an M-MLV-derived mutant virus not encoding gP85gag, were not lysed by the CTL clones. The same CTL clones were shown previously to induce the destruction of M-MLV-induced tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity. We have now characterized CTL-resistant antigen-loss tumor cell variants that have lost the surface antigen, but which retain transcriptionally silent M-MLV genomes. A cloned antigen-loss variant that reverted in vitro to the CTL-susceptible phenotype reexpressed M-MLV genomes that had undergone an insertion event in the region of the viral DNA coding for the gag membrane protein. Intravenous injection of virus-specific CTL clones inhibited tumor formation in mice injected subcutaneously with M-MSV--M-MLV.",M2
3871705,"T-cell regulation of erythropoiesis during acute lymphoblastic leukemia.How and where erythropoiesis is maintained during advanced leukemic disease is an important and, as yet, unresolved question in hematology. To address the potential role of T-lymphocytes as cells that regulate CFU-E differentiation during leukemogenesis, an experimental model of disease has been developed in inbred Balb/c mice. Specifically, three-week-old Balb/c By mice were injected with <e>murine sarcoma virus</e>-murine leukemia virus-Moloney (MSV-MuLV-M), which resulted 6-8 months later in the development of immunoblastic T-cell sarcomas with a leukemic phase. Splenic T cells from either normal or tumor-bearing mice were assessed for their relative ability to modulate erythroid differentiation. Quantitatively, T cells, Ly1 or Ly 2,3 T-cell subsets isolated from tumor-bearing animals significantly enhanced erythropoiesis when compared with comparable normal T-cell subsets. These data suggest that the compensatory shift of erythropoiesis from the bone marrow to the spleen observed during leukemogenesis was facilitated by splenic T cells. In this circumstance, the enhanced erythropoietic function may be mediated by splenic T cells, which are selectively activated by virus.",M2
3856225,"Efficient transcription of a protein-coding gene from the RNA polymerase I promoter in transfected cells.The activity of the mouse ribosomal promoter was examined after fusion to the gene coding for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and transfection into mouse cells. Very little CAT enzyme but high levels of CAT-specific RNA correctly initiated at the ribosomal DNA start site were synthesized. The amount of specific transcripts was neither influenced by long stretches of upstream spacer sequences nor by the insertion of the Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> enhancer. The deletion mutant pMr delta-39, which has been shown to be fully active in vitro, exhibited a 90% decrease in template activity in vivo. A mutant in which 22 base pairs of ribosomal DNA (between positions -35 and -14) were substituted by foreign DNA sequences proved transcriptionally inactive. The fusion genes were only transcribed in mouse cells, indicating that species-specific transcription factors are involved in ribosomal promoter recognition.",M2
6095271,"Introduction of a selectable gene into different animal tissue by a retrovirus recombinant vector.The potential use of retrovirus vectors to transduce foreign genetic information into cells of different tissues of an animal was explored by introducing a recombinant genome carrying the Eco gpt gene into postimplantation mouse embryos. To obviate the need for preparing concentrated virus stocks, psi 2-2-5 cells producing the replication-defective <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> (MSV)-gpt virus were microinjected directly into embryos. The psi 2-2-5 cells were mixed with cells producing replication-competent Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) to facilitate spread of the vector. A high percentage of the manipulated embryos continued to develop without disturbance and were analyzed either prior to birth or as adults for expression of both helper and Eco gpt virus. Microinjection of as few as 10 Mo-MuLV-producing cells resulted in viremia of greater than 50% of the embryos or adults, 25%-30% of which produced MSV-gpt recombinant virus in a variety of organs including thymus, spleen, lung, kidney, and brain. The fraction of vector-producing cells, however, was 3 to 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of helper-virus-producing cells. Our results demonstrate that a selectable gene can be introduced by retroviral vectors into animals and can be expressed in a wide variety of different somatic tissues.",M2
6480709,"Temperature-dependent transmembrane potential changes in cells infected with a temperature-sensitive Moloney sarcoma virus.Normal rat kidney cells (NRK) infected with the temperature-sensitive (ts) transformation mutant of Moloney <e>murine sarcoma virus</e> yielded a clone of cells, 6m2, that exhibited a transformed morphology at 33 degrees C and a normal morphology at 39 degrees C. Transmembrane potential (Em) was measured fluorometrically using a cyanine dye diS-C3-(5). Fluorescence was inversely correlated with Em. Cells at 33 degrees C had lower Em. Em changes were recorded within 15 minutes of temperature shift from 33 degrees C to 39 degrees C in both directions, increasing in the 33 degrees C to 39 degrees C direction and decreasing in the 39 degrees C to 33 degrees C direction. Uninfected NRK cells when shifted under the same condition exhibited small fluorescence changes in the 33 degrees C to 39 degrees C direction. Shifting from 39 degrees C to 33 degrees C resulted in Em changes similar to those in 6m2 cells. Also studied was a cell line infected with a spontaneous revertant of the ts mutant, designated 54-5A4; it was transformed at both temperatures. Shifting from 33 degrees C to 39 degrees C in both directions yielded small changes. Transmembrane potential changes in 6m2 cells precede other transformation-specific changes that occur after a temperature shift.",M2
