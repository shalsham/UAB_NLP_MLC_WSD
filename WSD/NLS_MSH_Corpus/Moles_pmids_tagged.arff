20214773,"A phylogenetic estimate for golden <e>moles</e> (Mammalia, Afrotheria, Chrysochloridae).BACKGROUND: Golden moles (Chrysochloridae) are small, subterranean, afrotherian mammals from South Africa and neighboring regions. Of the 21 species now recognized, some (e.g., Chrysochloris asiatica, Amblysomus hottentotus) are relatively common, whereas others (e.g., species of Chrysospalax, Cryptochloris, Neamblysomus) are rare and endangered. Here, we use a combined analysis of partial sequences of the nuclear GHR gene and morphological characters to derive a phylogeny of species in the family Chrysochloridae. RESULTS: Although not all nodes of the combined analysis have high support values, the overall pattern of relationships obtained from different methods of phylogeny reconstruction allow us to make several recommendations regarding the current taxonomy of golden moles. We elevate Huetia to generic status to include the species leucorhinus and confirm the use of the Linnean binomial Carpitalpa arendsi, which belongs within Amblysominae along with Amblysomus and Neamblysomus. A second group, Chrysochlorinae, includes Chrysochloris, Cryptochloris, Huetia, Eremitalpa, Chrysospalax, and Calcochloris. Bayesian methods make chrysochlorines paraphyletic by placing the root within them, coinciding with root positions favored by a majority of randomly-generated outgroup taxa. Maximum Parsimony (MP) places the root either between chrysochlorines and amblysomines (with Chlorotalpa as sister taxon to amblysomines), or at Chlorotalpa, with the former two groups reconstructed as monophyletic in all optimal MP trees. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of additional genetic loci for this clade is important to confirm our taxonomic results and resolve the chrysochlorid root. Nevertheless, our optimal topologies support a division of chrysochlorids into amblysomines and chrysochlorines, with Chlorotalpa intermediate between the two. Furthermore, evolution of the chrysochlorid malleus exhibits homoplasy. The elongate malleus has evolved just once in the Cryptochloris-Chrysochloris group; other changes in shape have occurred at multiple nodes, regardless of how the root is resolved.",M1
20138223,"Molecular systematics and evolutionary biogeography of the genus Talpa (Soricomorpha: Talpidae).The range of the genus Talpa covers almost all Europe up to Western Asia. This genus has never been the object of comprehensive systematic studies using molecular and genetic techniques, such that the evolutionary relationships among species remain unclear. Talpa shows high levels of endemism, and the influence of past glaciation cycles on the distribution pattern of several species has been hypothesized. In this work, we assessed the molecular systematics of the genus using the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b from eight of the nine extant species of Talpa <e>moles</e>. Furthermore, molecular clock estimations were used to hypothesize a biogeographic scenario in concordance with fossil data. Results suggest a monophyletic origin of the genus and a common ancestor for the western European moles T. europaea, T. caeca, T. romana and T. occidentalis. The eastern species T. altaica and T. caucasica are basally divergent. The estimated ages of divergence among lineages are in accordance with a Miocene origin of the extant moles. The genus likely originated in Asia, spreading into Europe during the Pliocene. The evolution of moles appears to have been driven by changes in moisture levels that influenced extinction and speciation events during the Miocene and the Pliocene. Pleistocene climatic oscillations likely caused the range shrinkages and expansions that led to the current distribution pattern of most Talpa species.",M1
19582155,"Evolutionary insights from a genetically divergent hantavirus harbored by the European common mole (Talpa europaea).BACKGROUND: The discovery of genetically distinct hantaviruses in shrews (Order Soricomorpha, Family Soricidae) from widely separated geographic regions challenges the hypothesis that rodents (Order Rodentia, Family Muridae and Cricetidae) are the primordial reservoir hosts of hantaviruses and also predicts that other soricomorphs harbor hantaviruses. Recently, novel hantavirus genomes have been detected in <e>moles</e> of the Family Talpidae, including the Japanese shrew mole (Urotrichus talpoides) and American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). We present new insights into the evolutionary history of hantaviruses gained from a highly divergent hantavirus, designated Nova virus (NVAV), identified in the European common mole (Talpa europaea) captured in Hungary. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Pair-wise alignment and comparison of the full-length S- and L-genomic segments indicated moderately low sequence similarity of 54-65% and 46-63% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, between NVAV and representative rodent- and soricid-borne hantaviruses. Despite the high degree of sequence divergence, the predicted secondary structure of the NVAV nucleocapsid protein exhibited the characteristic coiled-coil domains at the amino-terminal end, and the L-segment motifs, typically found in hantaviruses, were well conserved. Phylogenetic analyses, using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, showed that NVAV formed a distinct clade that was evolutionarily distant from all other hantaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Newly identified hantaviruses harbored by shrews and moles support long-standing virus-host relationships and suggest that ancestral soricomorphs, rather than rodents, may have been the early or original mammalian hosts.",M1
19382159,"SOX9 is not required for the cellular events of testicular organogenesis in XX mole ovotestes.Mammalian sex determination is the genetic process that commits the undifferentiated bipotential gonads to develop as either testes or ovaries. The differentiation of SOX9-expressing Sertoli cells is assumed to be necessary to initiate testis development. Insectivorous <e>moles</e> of the genus Talpa represent a unique case of generalized true hermaphroditism, as XX female moles constitutively develop two ovotestes instead of normal ovaries. In this work, we have investigated the expression patterns of a number of genes known to play key roles in gonad organogenesis, throughout the entire process of ovotestis development in female moles. Molecular and morphological evidence are provided that these ovotestes contain primary medullary testis-like cords, Leydig cells, peritubular myoid cells, and a testis-specific vasculature, but no Sertoli cells. Our results show for the first time that SOX9 is not required for the formation of the primary testis cords, but it is necessary for the maintenance and subsequent development of these cords. In addition, the expression pattern of WNT4 in male and female moles indicates that this gene inhibits Leydig cell differentiation and, contrary to the proposed scenario in the mouse, it is not required for the colonization and survival of primordial germ cells. According to our data, mole ovotestes result from a process of PDGFRalpha-mediated mesonephric cell migration, which occurs simultaneously in both sexes. The fact that FST remains inactive during the critical stages of female gonad development, explains the lack of migration inhibition, and may be a consequence of improper WNT4 signalling in the mole.",M1
19341331,"Genotoxic assessment of small mammals at an illegal dumpsite at the Aomori-Iwate prefectural boundary.In 2003, we examined the chromosomes of grass voles at an illegal dumpsite at the Aomori-lwate prefectural boundary. In subsequent years, from 2003-2006, we surveyed the chromosomes of four species of small mammals, namely, the Japanese grass vole (Microtus montebelli), the large Japanese field mouse (Apodemus speciosus), the small Japanese field mouse (A. argenteus), and the greater Japanese shrew mole (Urotrichus talpoides). Each annual survey revealed, both on a yearly basis and during the entire period in question, that the frequencies of breaks and gaps in chromosomes of M. montebelli were significantly higher at the dumpsite than on the outskirts and in controls, suggesting that grass voles at the dumpsite have been subject to continuous genotoxic effects since the establishment of the dumpsite. We also ascertained that grass voles are much more susceptible to chromosomal damage than field mice and shrew <e>moles</e>, which had very low levels of chromosomal aberrations at the dumpsite, on the outskirts of the dumpsite, and in controls. Our four-year survey revealed two variants of M. montebelli from the dumpsite with M6 fission (2n=31), two variants of A. speciosus from the outskirts with XO monosomy (2n=47, XO), and a variant of A. speciosus from the dumpsite with situs inversus. Our analysis confirms our previously proposed hypothesis that M. montebelli might be useful as an indicator species for genotoxic assessment of below-ground pollution by industrial waste at illegal dumpsites.",M1
18852902,"Worm grunting, fiddling, and charming--humans unknowingly mimic a predator to harvest bait.BACKGROUND: For generations many families in and around Florida's Apalachicola National Forest have supported themselves by collecting the large endemic earthworms (Diplocardia mississippiensis). This is accomplished by vibrating a wooden stake driven into the soil, a practice called  worm grunting . In response to the vibrations, worms emerge to the surface where thousands can be gathered in a few hours. Why do these earthworms suddenly exit their burrows in response to vibrations, exposing themselves to predation? PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here it is shown that a population of eastern American <e>moles</e> (Scalopus aquaticus) inhabits the area where worms are collected and that earthworms have a pronounced escape response from moles consisting of rapidly exiting their burrows to flee across the soil surface. Recordings of vibrations generated by bait collectors and moles suggest that  worm grunters  unknowingly mimic digging moles. An alternative possibility, that worms interpret vibrations as rain and surface to avoid drowning is not supported. CONCLUSIONS: Previous investigations have revealed that both wood turtles and herring gulls vibrate the ground to elicit earthworm escapes, indicating that a range of predators may exploit the predator-prey relationship between earthworms and moles. In addition to revealing a novel escape response that may be widespread among soil fauna, the results show that humans have played the role of  rare predators  in exploiting the consequences of a sensory arms race.",M1
18758166,"Comparative cytogenetics of <e>moles</e> (Eulipotyphla, Talpidae): chromosomal differences in Talpa romana and T. europaea.The genus Talpa is the most specious and widespread one in the family Talpidae. The existing karyological records are predominantly basic morphological descriptions. To further investigate the case in point, we performed a comparative cytogenetic study in the genus by comparing G- and C-chromosome banding and NOR patterns of the two European species, T. romana and T. europaea, along with available data regarding several other mole species. Chromosomal hybridization patterns for telomeric repeats and major and 5S ribosomal RNA genes were obtained in T. romana and T. europaea for the first time. The comparison of these patterns revealed differences in distribution of interstitial telomeric repeats and 5S ribosomal RNA genes in the two species with apparently identical karyotypes but different evolutionary histories.",M1
18544934,"Chromosomal evolution and distribution of telomeric repeats in golden <e>moles</e> (Chrysochloridae, Mammalia).Golden moles (Chrysochloridae) are small, subterranean mammals endemic to sub-Saharan Africa that together with tenrecs constitute one of six orders in Afrotheria. Here we present a comprehensive karyotypic comparison among six species/subspecies of golden moles based on G-banding and chromosome painting. By expanding the species representation to include a further five species recently published in a companion paper, we were able to map the distribution of telomeric repeats in ten species/subspecies that are representative of six of the nine currently recognized genera. We conclude that: (i) the monophyly of Amblysomus is supported by the amplification of heterochromatin in several pericentric regions and one intrachromosomal rearrangement; (ii) A. hottentotus meesteri groups as sister to a clade that contains A. h. hottentotus, A. h. longiceps, A. h. pondoliae and A. robustus, an association that is underpinned by a shared intrachromosomal rearrangement and the detection of telomeric sequences in the centromeres of all chromosomes of the three A. hottentotus subspecies and A. robustus but, importantly, not in those of A. h. meesteri. These findings indicate an absence of gene flow suggesting that A. h. meesteri should be elevated to specific status. We hypothesize that the lack of gene flow may, in part, reflect hybrid dysgenesis resulting from abnormal meiotic segregation as a consequence of differences in the nature of the centromeric specific satellites; (iii) chromosomes 7 and 13 of Chrysochloris asiatica are fused in both Calcochloris obtusirostris and Eremitalpa granti, but that the position of the centromere in the fused chromosome differs in each species. This suggests that rather than being indicative of common ancestry, the fusion is more likely a convergent character which has arisen independently in each lineage. Furthermore our painting data show two centromeric shifts that are probably autapomorphic for C. obtusirostris. Finally, we conclude that (iv) golden moles are characterized by strong karyotypic conservatism but in marked contrast to the constrained rates of change exhibited by most species, A. robustus is unique in that three autapomorphic fissions define its evolutionary history, and hence the more extensive reshuffling of its genome.",M1
18391517,"Meiosis onset is postponed to postnatal stages during ovotestis development in female <e>moles</e>.In mammals, germ cells are important both during development and for the function of female gonads, whereas male gonads may develop in the absence of germ cells. The gonads of female moles (genus Talpa) develop according to a testis-like pattern which results in the formation of ovotestes. In this paper, we studied the expression pattern of several pre-meiotic and meiotic germ cell markers, in order to establish the precise time of meiosis onset in the mole species T. occidentalis, and to investigate the location and possible role of germ cells in ovotestis organogenesis. Our results evidenced that: (1) the asymmetrical distribution of primordial germ cells, which concentrate in the cortex of the XX gonad, is brought about by germ cell depletion from the medulla between the s5a and s5b stages, (2) XX germ cells enter meiosis postnatally, which is quite exceptional among eutherian mammals, and (3) XX but not XY germ cells of moles express DMRT1 during premeiotic stages of development, an expression pattern not described previously in vertebrates.",M1
18085526,"The evolution of female mole ovotestes evidences high plasticity of mammalian gonad development.Previous studies of the reproductive biology and genetics of European <e>moles</e> (Talpa spp.) showed that all females of these species have ovotestes (gonads with testicular and ovarian tissue) instead of normal ovaries, a unique specialization among mammals. Females are fertile as their ovarian tissue is fully functional. Testicular tissue is abnormal and sterile, but produces high levels of testosterone. This phenomenon also characterizes other talpid species from Europe and North America. To study the origin of this singular reproductive specialization, we examined the gonads of several female specimens belonging to two critical taxa. Although large Japanese moles (Mogera wogura) posses ovotestes, greater Japanese shrew moles (Urotrichus talpoides) are characterized by normal ovaries. The results fit parsimoniously with a recent phylogenetic study that places Urotrichus relatively basal in the talpid tree and separate from the American shrew mole. Parsimony reconstruction on alternative phylogenetic hypotheses clearly indicates that reversal(s) must have occurred and suggests that a relatively simple genetic mechanism must be associated with the evolution of female hermaphroditism in moles.",M1
17978831,"Deaths caused by mole guns: three case reports.Possession of firearms is limited because of the technological requirements in production and strict laws. However, anyone can manufacture a handmade firearm by following simple instructions and has no legal liability. A mole gun is an unusual weapon used to kill <e>moles</e> in agricultural areas. It propels pellets in a similar way as a shotgun. This study presents three cases of death caused by mole guns. Two of the cases were accidental, and the other case was suicidal. The first case involved a 51-year-old man who was checking the mole gun when it fired, injuring his left eye and the left region of his face. He died in the hospital after 3 days of medical treatment. The second case was a 78-year-old man, who had been intermittently treated for depression over the last 15 years. He died instantly after placing the mole gun vertically against his head and firing it. The third case was a 43-year-old man who had been trying to set up a mole gun device in his potato field when the weapon accidentally discharged. The victim was injured seriously and died in the hospital a short time later. In conclusion, because the mole gun may cause lethal wounds in humans when fired from a short distance, the researchers believe that its production and use should be in accordance with firearms laws.",M1
17387732,"Fine structure of Eimer's organ in the coast mole (Scapanus orarius).Eimer's organ is a small, densely innervated sensory structure found on the glabrous rhinarium of most talpid <e>moles</e>. This structure consists of an epidermal papilla containing a central circular column of cells associated with intraepidermal free nerve endings, Merkel cell neurite complexes, and lamellated corpuscles. The free nerve endings within the central cell column form a ring invested in the margins of the column, surrounding 1-2 fibers that pass through the center of the column. A group of small-diameter nociceptive free nerve endings that are immunoreactive for substance P surrounds this central ring of larger-diameter free nerve endings. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a high concentration of tonofibrils in the epidermal cells of the central column, suggesting they are more rigid than the surrounding keratinocytes and may play a mechanical role in transducing stimuli to the different receptor terminals. The intraepidermal free nerve endings within the central column begin to degrade 15 microm from the base of the stratum corneum and do not appear to be active within the keratinized outer layer. The peripheral free nerve endings are structurally distinct from their counterparts in the central column and immunocytochemical double labeling with myelin basic protein and substance P indicates these afferents are unmyelinated. Merkel cell-neurite complexes and lamellated corpuscles are similar in morphology to those found in a range of other mammalian skin.",M1
17297137,"Response properties of primary afferents supplying Eimer's organ.The mole's nose is covered with mechanosensory structures called Eimer's organs. Each organ contains Merkel cell-neurite complexes, Paciniform corpuscles and intraepidermal free nerve endings. The function of Eimer's organ has been the subject of speculation since the 1800s, but responses from the afferents have never been investigated. Our goal was to explore the function of Eimer's organ by recording primary afferent responses to a range of mechanosensory stimuli. Unit activity from the trigeminal ganglion was recorded from coast (Scapanus orarius) and star-nosed (Condylura cristata) <e>moles</e>, while stimulating the nose with a Chubbuck mechanosensory stimulator, a piezo-electric sweeping stimulator, and hand-held probes. Stimuli included static indentations, sinusoidal displacements, different indentation velocities, displacement amplitudes, and directional stimuli across the skin. Receptive fields were small, sometimes restricted to single Eimer's organs. Responses were consistent with a slowly adapting Merkel cell-neurite complex-like receptor class and a dynamically sensitive Pacinian-like rapidly adapting class. A second rapidly adapting class was hypothesized to represent activity of prominent free nerve endings within a central cell column. Some receptors were most sensitive to stimuli applied in particular directions across the skin. Most receptors relayed mechanosensory input with high temporal fidelity. In addition some receptors were tuned to respond best when stimulated at a velocity matching the velocity of the nose during foraging. These results support the hypothesis that Eimer's organ functions to detect small surface features and textures by encoding and integrating deflection information for multiple Eimer's organs during brief touches.",M1
17180635,"Chromosome painting and molecular dating indicate a low rate of chromosomal evolution in golden <e>moles</e> (Mammalia, Chrysochloridae).Golden moles (Chrysochloridae) are poorly known subterranean mammals endemic to Southern Africa that are part of the superordinal clade Afrotheria. Using G-banding and chromosome painting we provide a comprehensive comparison of the karyotypes of five species representing five of the nine recognized genera: Amblysomus hottentotus, Chrysochloris asiatica, Chrysospalax trevelyani, Cryptochloris zyli and Eremitalpa granti. The species are karyotypically highly conserved. In total, only four changes were detected among them. Eremitalpa granti has the most derived karyotype with 2n = 26 and differs from the remaining species (all of whom have 2n = 30) by one centric and one telomere:telomere fusion. In addition, two intrachromosomal rearrangements were detected in A. hottentotus. The painting probes also suggest the presence of a unique satellite DNA family located on chromosomes 11 and 12 of both C. asiatica and C. zyli. This represents a synapomorphy linking these two sympatric species as sister taxa. A molecular clock was calibrated adopting a relaxed Bayesian approach for multigene data sets comprising publicly available sequences derived from five gene fragments representative of three golden moles and 39 other eutherian species. The data suggest that golden moles diverged from a common ancestor approximately 28.5 mya (95% credibility interval = 21.5-36.5 mya). Based on an inferred chrysochlorid ancestral karyotype of 2n = 30, the estimated rate of 0.7 rearrangements per 10 my (95% Credibility Interval = 0.54-0.93) differs from the 'default rate' of mammalian chromosomal evolution which has been estimated at one change per 10 million years, thus placing the Chrysochloridae among the slower-evolving chromosomal lineages thus far recorded.",M1
16944164,"Ossicular density in golden <e>moles</e> (Chrysochloridae).The densities of middle ear ossicles of golden moles (family Chrysochloridae, order Afrosoricida) were measured using the buoyancy method. The internal structure of the malleus was examined by high-resolution computed tomography, and solid-state NMR was used to determine relative phosphorus content. The malleus density of the desert golden mole Eremitalpa granti (2.44 g/cm3) was found to be higher than that reported in the literature for any other terrestrial mammal, whereas the ossicles of other golden mole species are not unusually dense. The increased density in Eremitalpa mallei is apparently related both to a relative paucity of internal vascularization and to a high level of mineralization. This high density is expected to augment inertial bone conduction, used for the detection of seismic vibrations, while limiting the skull modifications needed to accommodate the disproportionately large malleus. The mallei of the two subspecies of E. granti, E. g. granti and E. g. namibensis, were found to differ considerably from one another in both size and shape.",M1
16837185,"Touching on somatosensory specializations in mammals.Specialized species often reveal general principles of brain organization and provide systems for analysis of sensory function. Subterranean species dependent on touch have particularly large somatosensory areas with modular cortical representations of sensory surfaces. Some species have added cortical areas to processing networks, have developed tactile foveas and have superior colliculi primarily devoted to somatosensation rather than vision. Recent studies reveal surprisingly large cortical representations of oral structures in primates and mole-rats. Cortical modules represent a range of different sensory surfaces in rodents, star-nosed <e>moles</e> and primates, indicating that similar developmental mechanisms operate in diverse species. Finally, manipulation of patterning genes in mice suggests evolutionary mechanisms for producing the specialized corticies of subterranean species.",M1
16751268,"Neuroanatomical evidence for segregation of nerve fibers conveying light touch and pain sensation in Eimer's organ of the mole.Talpid <e>moles</e> are small insectivores that live in dark underground tunnels. They depend heavily on touch to navigate and find food. Most species have an array of complex epidermal sensory structures called Eimer's organs that cover the tip of the nose. In this study, the anatomy of Eimer's organ was examined in the coast mole and star-nosed mole by using the fluorescent styryl pyridinium dye AM1-43 and immunocytochemical staining for neurofilament 200 and substance P. In addition, DiI was used to label neural components of Eimer's organ. AM1-43 labeled all of the Eimer's organ receptors after systemic injection, suggesting a role in mechanotransduction. Immunostaining with neurofilament 200 and substance P labeled distinct subtypes of sensory fibers. Substance P labeled a group of free nerve endings along the outer edge of Eimer's organ, indicating a nociceptive role for these fibers. In contrast, neurofilament 200 labeled a more central set of nerve endings, suggesting that these fibers function as low-threshold mechanoreceptors. By labeling subsets of trigeminal afferents distant from the receptor array with DiI, we revealed innervation patterns indicating that one afferent supplies the outer, substance P-positive set of free nerve endings, whereas several afferents differentially innervate the central free nerve endings. Our results suggest that the free nerve endings innervating Eimer's organ are largely mechanosensitive and may play an important role in the rapid sensory discrimination observed in these species.",M1
16521787,"Preliminary evidence for the use of microseismic cues for navigation by the Namib golden mole.Insect prey of the Namib golden mole congregate beneath clumps of grass scattered among the sand dunes of the Namib Desert. In the presence of the light winds that typically blow over the Namib Desert, these grass clumps emit low-amplitude vibrations that are transmitted through the sand. While foraging in the sand-swimming mode (a few centimeters below the surface of the sand), some <e>moles</e> apparently were attracted toward manmade sources emitting vibrations matching those recorded from the grass clumps. This is the first direct evidence that these desert mammals use seismic cues for navigation.",M1
16511863,"Evolution of the middle ear apparatus in Talpid <e>moles</e>.The middle ear structures of eight species of mole in the family Talpidae (Mammalia: Eulipotyphla) were studied under light and electron microscopy. Neurotrichus, Parascalops, and Condylura have a simple middle ear cavity with a loose ectotympanic bone, ossicles of a  microtype  morphology, and they retain a small tensor tympani muscle. These characteristics are ancestral for talpid moles. Talpa, Scalopus, Scapanus, and Parascaptor species, on the other hand, have a looser articulation between malleus and ectotympanic bone and a reduced or absent orbicular apophysis. These species lack a tensor tympani muscle, possess complete bullae, and extensions of the middle ear cavity pneumatize the surrounding basicranial bones. The two middle ear cavities communicate in Talpa, Scapanus, and Parascaptor species. Parascaptor has a hypertrophied malleus, a feature shared with Scaptochirus but not found in any other talpid genus. Differences in middle ear morphology within members of the Talpidae are correlated with lifestyle. The species with middle ears closer to the ancestral type spend more time above ground, where they will be exposed to high-frequency sound: their middle ears appear suited for transmission of high frequencies. The species with derived middle ear morphologies are more exclusively subterranean. Some of the derived features of their middle ears potentially improve low-frequency hearing, while others may reduce the transmission of bone-conducted noise. By contrast, the unusual middle ear apparatus of Parascaptor, which exhibits striking similarities to that of golden moles, probably augments seismic sensitivity by inertial bone conduction.",M1
16469165,"Helminth fauna of Talpa spp. in the Palaearctic Realm.The helminth fauna of the genus Talpa in the Palaearctic Realm is reviewed. Several helminth species reported in Talpa spp. by a number of authors are discussed, with reference to host specificity, parasite biology, and host ethology, ecology and phylogeny. Twelve species of cestodes were found, two of which exhibit stenoxenous specificity (Staphylocystis bacillaris and Multitesticulata filamentosa). Only three species of trematodes, Ityogonimus lorum, Ityogonimus ocreatus and Combesia macrobursata, are exclusive parasites of Talpa spp. The largest group are nematodes, with 37 species. Species of Tricholinstowia are parasites of holarctic talpids and several species of distinct genera, such as Capillaria, Soboliphyme and Trichuris, are found only in Talpa spp. Only acanthocephalans of the genus Moniliformis have been reported in <e>moles</e> of the genus Talpa. On the basis of these helminthological findings, the close phylogenetic relationship between moles (Talpidae) and shrews (Soricidae) supports the separation of the ordinal levels Soricomorpha and Erinaceomorpha.",M1

16215983,"Evolution of sensory specializations in insectivores.Although insectivores have traditionally been thought of as primitive mammals with few specializations, recent studies have revealed great diversity in the sensory systems and brain organization of members of this mammalian order. The present article reviews some of these findings in three insectivore families that are thought to form a monophyletic group. These include hedgehogs (Erinaceidae), <e>moles</e> (Talpidae), and shrews (Soricidae). Members of each group live in unique ecological niches, have differently specialized senses, and exhibit different behaviors. Hedgehogs have well-developed visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems. Shrews make use of visual and auditory cues, but appear to depend most heavily on touch, particularly through prominent vibrissae. Moles are somatosensory specialists with small eyes and ears and unique epidermal mechanoreceptors called Eimer's organs used to identify prey and investigate their environment. In contrast to historical views of the insectivore order, members of this group have discrete and well-organized cortical sensory areas with sharp borders as determined from both electrophysiological mapping and analysis of cortical histology. Comparison of cortical organization across species reveals a number of specializations, including expansion of cortical representations of important sensory surfaces, the addition of cortical areas to some processing networks, and the subdivision of areas into separate cortical modules. In the case of the star-nosed mole, the somatosensory system has a tactile fovea and shares a number of features in common with the visual systems of sighted mammals.",M1
16159690,"PCDDs, PCDFs, and coplanar PCBs in wild terrestrial mammals from Japan: congener specific accumulation and hepatic sequestration.The present study determined the contamination levels and congener-specific accumulation features of dioxins and related compounds (DRCs) in wild terrestrial mammals such as large Japanese field mice (LJFM), lesser Japanese <e>moles</e> (LJMs), and raccoon dogs (RDs) collected from Kanto region in Japan during 2001. The toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) levels in the carcasses or adipose tissues were in the order of RDs &gt; or = LJMs &gt; LJFM. Comparison of DRC congener profiles in the three species and principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated a higher contribution of OCDD, T4CB77, and P5CB118 in LJMs. Analysis of liver-adipose distribution of DRC congeners in RDs showed that livers contained significantly higher TEQs than adipose tissues, indicating that liver is a depository organ and critical for determining the toxicokinetics of DRCs. As for most T4, P5, H6CDD/DFs and for P5CB126, H6CB169 and mono-ortho PCB congeners, their liver/adipose concentration ratios in RDs revealed a tendency to increase with hepatic TEQ levels, suggesting TEQ-dependent hepatic sequestration.",M1
16103657,"Karyotypic evolution and organization of the highly repetitive DNA sequences in the Japanese shrew-<e>moles</e>, Dymecodon pilirostris and Urotrichus talpoides.The karyological relationship and organization of highly repetitive DNA sequences in Japanese shrew-moles were studied by zoo-blot hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). When the genomic DNA of the eastern race of Urotrichus talpoides was digested with PstI, three fragments of highly repetitive DNA sequences, approximately 0.7, 0.9, and 1.4 kb in length, were observed as distinct bands. The results of FISH in the eastern race of U. talpoides using these three fragments separately as probes showed that the 0.7-kb PstI fragment was distributed in the centromeric regions of most chromosomes, and that the 0.9- and 1.4-kb fragments were predominantly located in the C-heterochromatin region of chromosome 13p. Although the western race of U. talpoides also had three PstI fragments, 0.9- and 1.4-kb PstI fragments were more ambiguous than those of the eastern race. The PstI- digested genomic DNA in Dymecodonpilirostris produced only a faint 0.9-kb band, and its signal patterns obtained by zoo-blot hybridization were clearly different from those of U. talpoides. The 0.7-kb fragment of U. talpoides hybridized strongly with the 0.9-kb fragment of D. pilirostris. In a FISH analysis, the 0.9-kb fragment of D. pilirostris hybridized with highly repetitive DNA in the centromeric regions of most chromosomes from both D. pilirostris and U. talpoides. Zoo-blot hybridization and FISH analyses suggest that the 0.9- and 1.4-kb PstI fragments were generated specifically in the genome of U. talpoides after the common ancestor differentiated into two extant shrew-mole species. A difference in the length of the centromeric elements between U. talpoides and D. pilirostris might be observed due to certain modifications of the repeating unit.",M1
15885250,"Seasonal energetics of the Hottentot golden mole at 1500 m altitude.Winter is an energetically stressful period for small mammals as increasing demands for thermoregulation are often coupled with shortages of food supply. In sub-tropical savannah, Hottentot golden <e>moles</e> (Ambysomus hottentottus longiceps) forage throughout the year and for long periods of each day. This may enable them to acquire sufficient resources from an insectivorous prey base that is both widely dispersed and energetically costly to obtain. However, they also inhabit much cooler regions; how their energy budgets are managed in these areas is unknown. We measured the daily energy expenditure (DEE), resting metabolic rate (RMR) and water turnover (WTO) of free-living golden moles during both winter and summer at high altitude (1500 m). We used measurements of deuterium dilution to estimate body fat during these two periods. DEE, WTO and body mass did not differ significantly between seasons. However, RMR values were higher during the winter than the summer and, in the latter case were also lower than allometric predictions. Body fat was also higher during the winter. Calculations show that during the winter they may restrict activity to shorter, more intense periods. This, together with an increase in thermal insulation, might enable them to survive the cold.",M1
15690041,"Asymptotic prey profitability drives star-nosed <e>moles</e> to the foraging speed limit.Foraging theory provides models for predicting predator diet choices assuming natural selection has favoured predators that maximize their rate of energy intake during foraging. Prey profitability (energy gained divided by prey handling time) is an essential variable for estimating the optimal diet. Time constraints of capturing and consuming prey generally result in handling times ranging from minutes to seconds, yet profitability increases dramatically as handling time approaches zero, providing the potential for strong directional selection for increasing predator speed at high encounter rates (tiny increments in speed increase profitability markedly, allowing expanded diets of smaller prey). We provide evidence that the unusual anatomical and behavioural specializations characterizing star-nosed moles resulted from progressively stronger selection for speed, allowing the progressive addition of small prey to their diet. Here we report handling times as short as 120 ms (mean 227 ms) for moles identifying and eating prey. 'Double takes' during prey identification suggest that star-nosed moles have reached the speed limit for processing tactile information. The exceptional speed of star-nosed moles, coupled with unusual specializations for finding and eating tiny prey, provide new support for optimal foraging theory.",M1
15613798,"Evolution and biogeography of talpid <e>moles</e> from continental East Asia and the Japanese islands inferred from mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences.We sequenced the cytochrome b gene from two little-studied mammal species from the highlands of Southwest China, the long-tailed mole Scaptonyx fusicaudus and the gracile shrew-like mole Uropsilus gracilis. This data was used to examine the phylogenetic relationships among 19 talpid species within the family Talpidae (Mammalia: Eulipotyphla). Cytochrome b gene trees supported a basal placement of shrew-like moles (Uropsilus) within the Talpidae, and suggested that fossorial specializations arose twice during talpid evolution. To assess the evolutionary relationships of moles endemic to this region, we additionally sequenced the 12S rRNA gene and the nuclear recombination-activating gene-1 from eight and ten East Asian taxa, respectively. Analyses of these single and concatenated data sets suggested that East Asian shrew moles diverged prior to the evolution of fossorial Eurasian moles. However, we were unable to determine whether semi-fossorial shrew moles are monophyletic. In contrast, fossorial Eurasian genera (Talpa, Mogera and Euroscaptor) were consistently found to form a monophyletic clade, with Mogera and Euroscaptor representing sister taxa. Furthermore, this fossorial clade grouped with the semi-aquatic Desmana, although with fairly low (35-62%) bootstrap support. Mogera imaizumii was found to be more closely related to M. wogura than to M. tokudae. This implies that the ancestors of these three species entered Japan from the Asian continent in this order via a series of migration events, suggesting that the Japanese Islands have played an important role in preserving mole lineages from ancient to recent times.",M1
15271442,"Placentation in species of phylogenetic importance: the Afrotheria.Afrotheria, one of four mammalian superorders, comprises elephants, sea cows, hyraxes, aardvark, elephant shrews, tenrecs and golden <e>moles</e>. Their placentas either form an equatorial band or are discoid in shape. The interhemal region, separating fetal and maternal blood, is endotheliochorial in elephants, aardvark and possibly the sea cows, but hemochorial in the remaining orders. There is a secondary epitheliochorial placenta in elephant shrews while a similar structure in tenrecs erodes maternal tissues. Specialized hemophagous regions are a striking characteristic of some of these placentas yet absent in hyraxes, elephant shrews, and golden moles. It is possible that the common ancestor of the Afrotheria had an endotheliochorial placenta. Establishment of a hemochorial condition, as seen in rock hyraxes, elephant shrews, tenrecs, and golden moles, would be a more recent development. The elephant, manatee, and aardvark all have circumferential placentas. Thus the formation of a discoid placenta with a more or less extensive secondary placenta in elephant shrews and tenrecs would also be a derived state.",M1
15216521,"Functional morphology of the middle ear in Chlorotalpa golden <e>moles</e> (Mammalia, Chrysochloridae): predictions from three models.The ossicular apparatus of golden moles in the genus Chlorotalpa has received comparatively little attention in the literature, although the malleus is known to be intermediate in size between the  unmodified  malleus of Amblysomus and the hypertrophied mallei found in some other golden moles. In the present study, the middle ear structures of three Chlorotalpa species (C. duthieae, C. sclateri, and C. arendsi) are described. Measurements of middle ear structures were applied into three existing models of middle ear function. The predictions from the models suggest that the airborne hearing of Chlorotalpa species is limited to relatively low frequencies, but the impedance transformation by the middle ear apparatus is expected to be reasonably efficient. The sensitivity of the middle ear apparatus to inertial bone conduction is intermediate between that predicted for Amblysomus and that predicted for species with hypertrophied mallei. Hearing in fossorial mammals may be limited by factors other than the middle ear apparatus: the predictions for Chlorotalpa must therefore be treated with caution. However, a consideration of the  intermediate  middle ear morphology of Chlorotalpa species sheds some light on the origin of ossicular hypertrophy in golden moles. The limited enlargement of the malleus seen in Chlorotalpa is expected to have improved seismic sensitivity by bone conduction significantly at low frequencies, while airborne hearing might not have been adversely affected.",M1
15086031,"Masculinization of female mammals: lessons from nature.Although varying degrees of genital masculinization are a reasonably common phenomenon in the world of female mammals, the majority of such variation has not been investigated. In this chapter we have described research on the  masculinized  genitalia of <e>moles</e> and hyenas. Such research raises intriguing possibilities regarding the coordinated role that androgens, estrogens and peptide hormones (e.g., relaxin) might play, at different stages of sexual differentiation and development, in preparing genital tissues for their functional roles in reproduction. Such studies also suggest that non-androgenic mechanisms need to be considered. Arnold (1996) and Carruth et al. (2002) have recently presented the argument for broadening our view of sexual differentiation of brain and behavior, emphasizing direct genetic effects. A similar view has been presented for the Tammar wallaby, where formation of a scrotum, or a pouch, is a direct consequence of the presence/absence of two X chromosomes (Pask and Renfree, 2001). Although our research on moles and hyenas has not yet yielded such definitive results, the research reviewed in this chapter calls attention to processes that could well operate in other mammals, including humans.",M1
15031103,"Testis-like development of gonads in female <e>moles</e>. New insights on mammalian gonad organogenesis.Moles are unique among mammals because all females of several species of genus Talpa have bilateral ovotestes (gonads with both ovarian and testicular tissue). Based on the analysis of a large sample of embryos, foetuses and infants over a 13-year period, we have studied the development of the gonads in male and female moles of the species Talpa occidentalis. Several new field and laboratory procedures were developed specifically to obtain and manage this singular material. Our results reveal that gonads of female moles develop according to a testis-like pattern, which includes cord formation and mesonephric cell migration, and begins at the same time as testis differentiation in males. The first signs of sex differentiation do not appear in males but in females. Female (but not male) gonads are regionalised with a cortex (precursor of the ovarian tissue) and a medulla (precursor of the testicular tissue). Germ cells concentrate only in the cortex, so that the medulla soon becomes sterile. Testicular tissue development is transiently retarded in females for about a week before birth, and resumes afterwards. Development of the ovarian tissue in females is considerably delayed with respect to that of testicular tissue in both males and females. The molecular characterisation of peritubular myoid cells, which are exclusive of testes, evidences the presence of testicular tissue in the gonads of female moles, which also contain Leydig cells. However, the absence of fully differentiated Sertoli cells indicates that these cells are not responsible for triggering the differentiation of such a testicular tissue. Our results are also discussed regarding the definition of Sertoli cell morphology and function, and the possible role of germ cells in the sex-reversal process. Differences observed between XX and XY gonad development in moles suggest that the mammalian testis-determining gene, SRY, has an  anti-regionalisation  role during gonadal development, at least in those mammalian species in which regionalisation of the female gonad occurs.",M1
15024748,"Organization of the main olfactory bulbs of some mammals: musk shrews, <e>moles</e>, hedgehogs, tree shrews, bats, mice, and rats.We immunohistochemically examined the organization of the main olfactory bulbs (MOBs) in seven mammalian species, including moles, hedgehogs, tree shrews, bats, and mice as well as laboratory musk shrews and rats. We focused our investigation on two points: 1) whether nidi, particular spheroidal synaptic regions subjacent to glomeruli, which we previously reported for the laboratory musk shrew MOBs, are also present in other animals and 2) whether the compartmental organization of glomeruli and two types of periglomerular cells we proposed for the rat MOBs are general in other animals. The general laminar pattern was similar among these seven species, but discrete nidi and the nidal layer were recognized only in two insectivores, namely, the mole and laboratory musk shrew. Olfactory marker protein-immunoreactive (OMP-IR) axons extended beyond the limits of the glomerular layer (GL) into the superficial region of the external plexiform layer (EPL) or the nidal layer in the laboratory musk shrew, mole, hedgehog, and tree shrew but not in bat, mouse, and rat. We observed, in nidi and the nidal layer in the mole and laboratory musk shrew MOBs, only a few OMP-IR axons. In the hedgehog, another insectivore, OMP-IR processes extending from the glomeruli were scattered and intermingled with calbindin D28k-IR cells at the border between the GL and the EPL. In the superficial region of the EPL of the tree shrew MOBs, there were a small number of tiny glomerulus-like spheroidal structures where OMP-IR axons protruding from glomeruli were intermingled with dendritic branches of surrounding calbindin D28k-IR cells. Furthermore, we recognized the compartmental organization of glomeruli and two types of periglomerular cells in the MOBs of all of the mammals we examined. These structural features are therefore considered to be common and important organizational principles of the MOBs.",M1
14748690,"Variation in ovarian morphology in four species of New World <e>moles</e> with a peniform clitoris.Female moles of the Old World genus Talpa display a curious suite of reproductive features that include a peniform clitoris and ovaries with a discrete interstitial gland or testis-like region (so-called 'ovotestes'). The masculinization of the female external genitalia in Talpa has accordingly been linked with secretion of androgens from the interstitial gland region of the fetal gonad. Although their ovarian morphology has received less attention, some species of New World moles also have ovaries with a pronounced interstitial gland (for example star-nosed mole, Condylura cristata), whereas females of other species do not (for example eastern mole, Scalopus aquaticus). Although it is difficult to determine the sex of both Old and New World moles, published accounts describing the external genitalia of female moles are available only for Talpa. The hypothesis that masculinization of the female external genitalia in moles is associated with the presence of an ovarian interstitial gland (OIG) was tested in the present study by using a comparative approach to determine whether these features are ever found in isolation of one another. Three genera of North American moles (Scapanus, Condylura and Neurotrichus) were studied and a peniform clitoris was found in all three species, but OIG were found in only two of three genera. The ovaries of S. latimanus and S. orarius were unremarkable, with no evidence of a discrete interstitial gland or testis-like region. Mapping these results onto recent talpid phylogenies indicates that loss of the bipolar ovarian morphology is a derived trait in Scapanus, and conclusively demonstrates that masculinization of the external genitalia in female moles can develop in the presence or absence of 'ovotestes'.",M1
14673194,"Tactile foveation in the star-nosed mole.Star-nosed <e>moles</e> have a specialized somatosensory system with 22 mechanosensory appendages surrounding the nostrils. A pair of appendages (the 11th pair on the ventral midline) acts as the tactile fovea and is used for detailed investigations. Here we used a high speed video camera to document movements of the star while moles searched for small prey items. Mole foraging behavior was very fast; the star, which is just over a centimeter in diameter, was touched to different areas of the environment approximately 13 times per second. This suggests that a mole foraging without interruption could potentially investigate 46,000 cm2 of surface area per hour. In 100% of 526 trials in which prey was identified and eaten, star-nosed moles made rapid, saccadic movements of the star to investigate the contacted prey with the foveal appendages. The movements of the star were similar to visual saccades in other species. Maximum velocity of the star during saccades was approximately 40 cm/s, and most saccades were between 30 and 60 ms in duration. As in the primate visual system, small corrective saccades were often needed to accurately foveate. We quantified the number of contacts different appendages made with prey items of various sizes during each encounter and compared this distribution to a previously proposed simulation of star movements during prey encounters. The behavior pattern and the simulation produced similar distributions of contact between the appendages and prey, and both distributions were closely correlated with the degree of cortical magnification of the appendage representations in primary somatosensory cortex (S1).",M1
14584782,"Abnormal sex-duct development in female <e>moles</e>: the role of anti-Müllerian hormone and testosterone.We have performed a morphological, hormonal and molecular study of the development of the sex ducts in the mole Talpa occidentalis. Females develop bilateral ovotestes with a functional ovarian portion and disgenic testicular tissue. The Müllerian ducts develop normally in females and their regression is very fast in males, suggesting a powerful action of the anti-Müllerian hormone in the mole. RT-PCR demonstrated that the gene governing this hormone begins to be expressed in males coinciding with testis differentiation, and expression continues until shortly after birth. Immunohistochemical studies showed that expression occurs in the Sertoli cells of testes. No expression was detected in females. Wolffian duct development was normal in males and degenerate in prenatal females, but developmental recovery after birth gave rise to the formation of rudimentary epididymides. This event coincides in time with increasing serum testosterone levels and Leydig cell differentiation in the female gonad, thus suggesting that testosterone produced by the ovotestes is responsible for masculinisation of female moles. During postnatal development, serum testosterone concentrations decreased in males but increased in females, thus approaching the levels that adult males and females have during the non-breeding season.",M1
12695089,"Molecular phylogenetic relationships of <e>moles</e>, shrew moles, and desmans from the new and old worlds.A Rich variety of anatomical and physiological specializations has enabled members of the family Talpidae (moles, shrew moles, and desmans) to exploit a diverse range of habitats: terrestrial, semi-aquatic, aquatic/fossorial, semi-fossorial, and fossorial. While numerous morphological and biochemical studies pertaining to the origin and radiation of the Talpidae have been completed, phylogenetic hypotheses remain controversial. To address this shortcoming we sequenced the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene (1140bp) from 29 individuals spanning 12 talpid species. Phylogenetic trees incorporating 12 New and Old World genera (18 species; all 3 extant subfamilies) were then constructed using NJ, MP, ML, and NJ-ML (NJ with ML parameters) methods. Our results provide molecular support for a mononphyletic Talpidae, and suggest that the 12 genera are clustered into seven major clades; (1) Asiatic shrew-like moles (Uropsilus), (2) North American aquatic/fossorial moles (Condylura), (3) North American fossorial moles (Parascalops, Scalopus, and Scapanus), (4) North American semi-fossorial shrew moles (Neurotrichus), (5) Japanese semi-fossorial shrew moles (Dymecodon and Urotrichus), (6) European semi-aquatic desmans (Desmana), and (7) Eurasian fossorial moles (Euroscaptor, Mogera, and Talpa). None of these groupings comprised mole species from both continents. In fact, North American moles and shrew moles do not appear to have specific affinities with Asian moles and shrew moles, respectively. Although low bootstrap support was generally found for evolutionary nodes uniting the major talpid clades, all gene trees constructed identified fossorial North American and Eurasian mole lineages as nonmonophyletic groups, suggesting subterranean specializations arose independently at least twice during the evolution of the Talpidae. Additionally, our data set provides molecular support for a basal divergence and long independent history of Uropsilus from the main talpid line, and refutes the traditional taxonomic status and secondarily basal phylogenetic placement of the subfamily Desmaninae within the Talpidae.",M1
12590828,"Effects of stimulus duration on neuronal response properties in the somatosensory cortex of the star-nosed mole.Star-nosed <e>moles</e> have a series of mechanosensory appendages surrounding each nostril. Each appendage is covered with sensory organs (Eimer's organs) containing both rapidly adapting and slowly adapting mechanoreceptors and each appendage is represented in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) by a single cortical module. When the skin surface of an appendage is depressed, neurons in the corresponding module in S1 respond in either a transient or sustained fashion. The aim of this study was to characterize and compare the responses of these two classes of neurons to both short (5 or 20 ms) and long (500 ms) mechanosensory stimulation. Activity from neurons in the representation of appendage 11, the somatosensory fovea, was recorded while delivering mechanosensory stimuli to the corresponding skin surface. Transient and sustained neurons had different levels of spontaneous activity and different responses to both short and long mechanosensory stimulation. Neurons with sustained responses had a significantly higher spontaneous firing rate than neurons with transient responses. Transient neurons responded to a 5 ms stimulus with excitation followed by suppression of discharge whereas sustained neurons did not exhibit post-excitatory suppression. Rather, responses of sustained neurons to 5 ms stimuli lasted several hundred milliseconds. Consequently sustained responses contained significantly more spikes than transient responses. These experiments suggest contact to the appendages causes two distinct firing patterns in cortex regardless of the duration of the stimulus. The sustained and transient responses could reflect either the activity of fundamentally different classes of neurons or activity in distinct subcortical and cortical networks.",M1
11976396,"Receptive fields and response properties of neurons in the star-nosed mole's somatosensory fovea.Star-nosed <e>moles</e> have an extraordinary mechanosensory system consisting of 22 densely innervated nasal appendages covered with thousands of sensitive touch domes. A single appendage acts as the fovea and the star is constantly shifted to touch this foveal appendage to objects of interest. Here we investigated the receptive fields on the star and the response properties of 144 neurons in the mole's primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Excitatory receptive fields were defined by recording multiunit activity from the S1 representations of the nasal appendages that form the star, while stimulating the touch domes on the skin surface with a small probe. Receptive fields were among the smallest reported for mammalian glabrous skin, averaging &lt;1 mm(2). The smallest receptive fields were found for the fovea representation, corresponding to its greater cortical magnification. Single units were then isolated, primarily from the representation of the somatosensory fovea, and the skin surface was stimulated with a small probe attached to a piezoelectric wafer controlled by a computer interface. The response properties of neurons and the locations of inhibitory surrounds were evaluated with two complementary approaches. In the first set of experiments, single microelectrodes were used to isolate unit activity in S1, and data were collected for stimulation to different areas of the sensory star. In the second set of experiments, a multi-electrode array (4 electrodes spaced at 200 microm in a linear sequence) was used to simultaneously record from isolated units in different cortical areas representing different parts of the sensory periphery. These experiments revealed a short-latency excitatory discharge to stimulation of the fovea followed by a long-lasting suppression of spontaneous activity. Sixty-one percent of neurons responded with an excitatory OFF response at the end of the stimulus; the remaining 39% of cells did not respond or were inhibited at stimulus offset. Stimulation of areas surrounding the central receptive field often revealed inhibitory surrounds. Forty percent of the neurons that responded to mechanosensory stimulation of the receptive field center were inhibited by stimulation of surrounding areas of skin on the same appendage. In contrast to neurons in rodent barrels, few neurons within a stripe representing an appendage responded to stimulation of neighboring (nonprimary) appendages on the snout. The small receptive fields, short latencies, and inhibitory surrounds are consistent with the star's role in rapidly determining the locations and identities of objects in a complex tactile environment.",M1
11818411,"Body oxygen stores, aerobic dive limits and diving behaviour of the star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata) and comparisons with non-aquatic talpids.The dive performance, oxygen storage capacity and partitioning of body oxygen reserves of one of the world's smallest mammalian divers, the star-nosed mole Condylura cristata, were investigated. On the basis of 722 voluntary dives recorded from 18 captive star-nosed <e>moles</e>, the mean dive duration (9.2+/-0.2 s; mean +/- S.E.M.) and maximum recorded dive time (47 s) of this insectivore were comparable with those of several substantially larger semi-aquatic endotherms. Total body O(2) stores of adult star-nosed moles (34.0 ml kg(-1)) were 16.4 % higher than for similarly sized, strictly fossorial coast moles Scapanus orarius (29.2 ml kg(-1)), with the greatest differences observed in lung and muscle O(2) storage capacity. The mean lung volume of C. cristata (8.09 ml 100 g(-1)) was 1.81 times the predicted allometric value and exceeded that of coast moles by 65.4 % (P=0.0001). The overall mean myoglobin (Mb) concentration of skeletal muscles of adult star-nosed moles (13.57+/-0.40 mg g(-1) wet tissue, N=7) was 19.5 % higher than for coast moles (11.36+/-0.34 mg g(-1) wet tissue, N=10; P=0.0008) and 54.2 % higher than for American shrew-moles Neurotrichus gibbsii (8.8 mg g(-1) wet tissue; N=2). The mean skeletal muscle Mb content of adult star-nosed moles was 91.1 % higher than for juveniles of this species (P&lt;0.0001). On the basis of an average diving metabolic rate of 5.38+/-0.35 ml O(2) g(-1) h(-1) (N=11), the calculated aerobic dive limit (ADL) of star-nosed moles was 22.8 s for adults and 20.7 s for juveniles. Only 2.9 % of voluntary dives by adult and juvenile star-nosed moles exceeded their respective calculated ADLs, suggesting that star-nosed moles rarely exploit anaerobic metabolism while diving, a conclusion supported by the low buffering capacity of their skeletal muscles. We suggest that a high mass-specific O(2) storage capacity and relatively low metabolic cost of submergence are key contributors to the impressive dive performance of these diminutive insectivores.",M1
11794732,"Areal and callosal connections in the somatosensory cortex of the star-nosed mole.Star-nosed <e>moles</e> have a well-developed somatosensory cortex with multiple cortical areas representing the behaviorally important tactile star. In each of three cortical representations, the 11 mechanosensory appendages from the contralateral nose are represented in a series of dark cytochrome oxidase modules. Here the connections of this complex cortical network were explored with injections of the neuroanatomical tracer wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP). The main goal was to determine the connection patterns of the somatosensory areas that represent the star. Injections of tracer made in or around the primary somatosensory representation (S1) of the star allowed us to determine the topography of local cortical connections and the projection and termination sites of corresponding interhemispheric connections. The results revealed precise topographic corticocortical connections reciprocally interconnecting the S1 star representation with its counterparts in S2 and in a third representation (S3) unique to star-nosed moles. Callosal connections from a widespread area of the contralateral hemisphere terminated primarily in the septa between cytochrome oxidase dark modules and in areas of cortex surrounding the star representations. However, midline structures of the star represented in S1 and S2 exhibited a high level of callosally labeled cells and terminals. This included label both within septa and within the centers of cytochrome oxidase dense modules representing midline appendages.",M1

Our analysis suggested that (1) a sister relationship exists between <e>moles</e> and shrews, which form an eulipotyphlan clade; (2) chiropterans have a sister-relationship with eulipotyphlans; and (3) the Eulipotyphla/Chiroptera clade is closely related to fereuungulates (Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla and Carnivora). Divergence times on the mammalian tree were estimated from consideration of a relaxed molecular clock, the amino acid sequences of 12 concatenated mitochondrial proteins and multiple reference criteria. Moles and shrews were estimated to have diverged approximately 48 MyrBP, and bats and eulipotyphlans to have diverged 68 MyrBP. Recent phylogenetic controversy over the polyphyly of microbats, the monophyly of rodents, and the position of hedgehogs is also examined.",M1
11668393,"Short interspersed elements (SINEs) from insectivores. Two classes of mammalian SINEs distinguished by A-rich tail structure.Four tRNA-related SINE families were isolated from the genome of the shrew Sorex araneus (SOR element), mole Mogera robusta (TAL element), and hedgehog Mesechinus dauuricus (ERI-1 and ERI-2 elements). Each of these SINEs families is specific for a single Insectivora family: SOR, for Soricidae (shrews); TAL, for Talpidae (<e>moles</e> and desmans); ERI-1 and ERI-2, for Erinaceidae (hedgehogs). There is a long polypyrimidine region (TC-motif) in TAL, ERI-1, and ERI-2 elements located immediately upstream of an A-rich tail with polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) and an RNA polymerase III terminator (T(4-6)) or TCT(3-4)). Ten out of 14 analyzed mammalian tRNA-related SINE families have an A-rich tail similar to that of TAL, ERI-1, and ERI-2 elements. These elements were assigned to class T+. The other four SINEs including SOR element have no polyadenylation signal and transcription terminator in their A-rich tail and were assigned to class T-. Class T+ SINEs occur only in mammals, and most of them have a long polypyrimidine region. Possible models of retroposition of class T+ and T- SINEs are discussed.",M1

It was found that the foveal appendage led development in the periphery, had the greatest innervated surface area in embryos, and developed mature nerve terminals and epidermal sensory organs first; also, in developing cortex, markers for metabolic activity (cytochrome oxidase) appeared first in the fovea representation. This developmental sequence may provide the fovea with an advantage in a competition for cortical space, and account for the much larger areas of cortex devoted to foveal afferents.",M1
11128799,"A myxozoan-like parasite causing xenomas in the brain of the mole, Talpa europaea L., 1758 (Vertebrata, Mammalia).Light and transmission electron microscopy revealed pericytes of brain capillaries of <e>moles</e> (Talpa europaea L., 1758) as parasitized intracellularly. These host cells were enlarged and of globular or ellipsoid shape, and incorporated a cell-within-cell sequence of primary, secondary and, rarely found, tertiary developmental stages of an eukaryotic organism. Other stages like spores were not discovered either in brain or in other organs. Due to the vertebrate host, and the parasitic cells showing the enveloped state this parasite can be classified as belonging to the Myxozoa rather than Paramyxea. Since spores, which would allow an exact identification of the parasite, could not be detected and mammals are very unusual hosts for Myxozoa, the parasite was designated a myxozoan-like organism.",M1
11125877,"Cortical-organization in <e>moles</e>: evidence of new areas and a specialized S2.The somatosensory cortex of several mole species (family Talpidae), with different peripheral sensory adaptations, was investigated and compared to determine common and specialized features of cortical organization. Previously unidentified medial representations of the trunk and limbs were found in all species, indicating that S1 in moles occupies a medial to lateral strip of cortex as in most other mammals. This finding suggests a large lateral forelimb representation, previously attributed to S1, is actually part of S2. In the face representation, evidence was found for three representations of the unusual nose of the star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata). Each of these areas was divided into a series of modules (visible in cytochrome oxidase processed tissue) representing individual nasal appendages on the star. In the closely related but less specialized eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus) and coast mole (Scapanus orarius), only two nose representations were identified in an area of cortex with a more uniform histological appearance. The results indicate that moles have enlarged somatosensory representations of the glabrous nose as compared to shrews and rats that instead have large vibrissal representations. In addition moles have a very large and specialized representation of the digging forepaw in S2. Since this part of S2 projects directly to the cervical spinal cord, the specialization may provide adaptive sensorimotor functions related to digging.",M1
11124516,"Epidermal sensory organs of <e>moles</e>, shrew moles, and desmans: a study of the family talpidae with comments on the function and evolution of Eimer's organ.The epidermal sensory organs of members of the family Talpidae (moles, shrew-moles, and desmans) were investigated and compared to determine the range of sensory specializations and better understand how they evolved. Small domed mechanosensory organs called 'Eimer's organs' were present on the rhinarium of nearly all species of talpids, but not among the sister group of shrews (Soricidae) or other insectivore families. This suggests that the common ancestor to the talpids possessed Eimer's organs. Two species of moles from the driest habitats did not exhibit Eimer's organs - suggesting that their sensory organs degenerated in response to harsh, abrasive soil conditions. The semi-aquatic desmans uniquely possessed tiny sensory hairs interspersed with their Eimer's organs; these may act to sense water currents. Some species exhibited a subdivided, star-like, rhinarium - resembling an early embryonic stage of the star-nosed mole and providing clues to the evolution of the star. A single genera (Uropsilus) that branched off early in the evolution of the talpids had Eimer's organ-like structures but lacked some typical components. These findings fill a major gap in our knowledge of talpid sensory biology and suggest (1) how Eimer's organs evolved, (2) how the unusual appendages of the star-nosed mole evolved, (3) that the evolution of Eimer's organ is convergent with the mechanosensory push-rod of monotremes. The results also demonstrate the features that distinguish Eimer's organ from similar configurations of sensory receptors in other mammalian skin surfaces. Finally, a mechanism for Eimer's organ function in detecting object and prey specific surface features is proposed.",M1

Female moles showed higher Zn concentrations in spleen, gonads and skin, higher Cd concentrations in femur and stomach and lower Cu content in kidneys compared to males. Age classes were determined using teeth section. A significant increase in Cd concentration with age was found in kidneys, liver, heart, lung, skin and femur, with the highest increase for kidney samples. Pb accumulated in bone tissue (femur) with increasing age. Although significant site differences in heavy metal concentrations of soil and vegetation samples existed, these differences were only partly reflected by tissue contents.",M1
10846617,"Molecular phylogeny of East Asian <e>moles</e> inferred from the sequence variation of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene.Taxonomic analysis has previously revealed that the species of moles that inhabit Japan are characterized by exceptional species richness and a high level of endemism. Here, we focused on the evolutionary history of the four Japanese mole species of the genera Euroscapter and Mogera, examining mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene sequences and comparing them with those of continental Mogera wogura (Korean and Russian populations), M. insularis from Taiwan, and Talpa europaea and T. altaica from the western and central Eurasian continent, respectively. Our data support the idea that in a radiation center somewhere on the Eurasian continent, a parental stock evolved to modern mole-like morph and radiated several times intermittently during the course of the evolution, spreading its branches to other peripheral geographic domains at each stage of the radiation. Under this hypothesis, the four lineages of Japanese mole species, E. mizura, M. tokudae, M. imaizumii, and M. wogura, could be explained to have immigrated to Japan in this order. Mogera wogura and M. imaizumii showed substantial amounts of geographic variation and somewhat complicated distributions of the cyt b gene types. These intraspecific variations are likely to be associated with the expansion processes of moles in the Japanese Islands during the Pleistocene glacial ages.",M1
10797327,"Female gonad of <e>moles</e>, genus Talpa (Insectivora, mammalia): ovary or ovotestis?The female gonads of moles (genus Talpa) are composed of a cortex, functioning as an ovary, and a medulla, which is structurally similar to that of the testis. In the female reproductive apparatus there are masculine glandular annexes, such as a bilobate prostate, two Cowper glands, and a penis-like clitoris. All these features have recently led to the hypothesis of the presence of hermaphroditism due to sex-reversal in Talpa. The purpose of this study is to understand the functional significance of the structural organization of the female gonads in order to verify this hypothesis. Histological, histochemical and ultrastructural analyses have been carried out on several gonads of both sexes of two species: T. europaea and T. romana, including three fetuses. In both species, the cortical region of the female gonad shows a regular oogenetic activity. While the medulla is composed of interstitial cells that are partly organized in cord-like structures, no spermatogenetic activity has been ever observed inside of them. A histochemical analysis shows that in both sexes the interstitial cells secrete steroids, presumably estrogens as well as androgens. The presence of androgens in the female gonads would therefore explain the persistence of male glandular annexes in the female reproductive apparatus and both the sexual and behavioral monomorphism typical of the genus Talpa. Nonetheless, the female gonad of moles is a real ovary and a well-defined gonochorism exists. Therefore, there is no reason to assert the presence of hermaphroditism due to sex reversal.",M1
10690203,"Reproductive features of the eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus) and star-nose mole (Condylura cristata).Since <e>moles</e> are closely related to shrews, the gametes and reproductive tracts of the star-nose mole (Condylura cristata) and the eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus) were examined to gain further insight into unusual reproductive traits of the Soricidae. Moles display many of these soricid traits, but with some important differences. The cumulus oophorus of Scalopus, ovulated about 16 h after hCG injection, was largely dispersed by hyaluronidase and, though quite dense, was nevertheless more similar to that of higher mammals than to the compact 'ball of the soricid cumulus. Within the female tract in these moles, approximately 85% of the length of the oviduct comprises a narrow ampulla with numerous differentiated crypts that, in shrews, house spermatozoa. However, in contrast to shrews, moles produce considerably larger numbers of spermatozoa, which challenges the proposal that, in shrews, oviductal sperm crypts specifically permit lower sperm production by the males. In the sperm head of these two moles, the acrosome displays the long rostrum that is typical of other Insectivora, and the perforatorium has the barbs by which soricid spermatozoa probably bind to the zona pellucida. Perhaps allied to this, immunoblots indicated that the immunoreactive acrosomal matrix of Scalopus spermatozoa is simpler than the polypeptide complex of the bovine and hamster acrosomal matrix.",M1
10607540,"Postprandial heat increment does not substitute for active thermogenesis in cold-challenged star-nosed <e>moles</e> (Condylura cristata).The postprandial increase in metabolic rate associated with consuming, assimilating and excreting a meal is often termed the heat increment of feeding (HIF). The metabolic heat production of star-nosed moles, Condylura cristata, held at thermoneutrality was monitored for 4 h following a single 10 min session of feeding on a ration consisting of 0 g (controls), 3.5 g or 10 g of earthworms. Coefficients for metabolizable energy digestibility and digesta passage rate of earthworms fed to C. cristata were also determined. We then tested whether feeding-induced thermogenesis substitutes partially or completely for thermoregulatory heat production in these animals exposed to sub-thermoneutral air temperatures (9-24 degrees C). A single feeding on earthworms had both short- and long-term effects on the metabolic rate and respiratory exchange ratio of C. cristata. The observed short-term (0-65 min) rise in metabolic rate, assumed to be associated primarily with the physical costs of nutrient digestion, absorption and excretion, was similar to the calculated mean retention time (66.7+/-7.8 min; mean +/- s.e. m., N=5) of this species. This component of the HIF represented 2.9 % of the food energy ingested by moles fed a single 3.5 g (13.21 kJ) meal of earthworms and 1.4 % of the food energy ingested by moles fed a single 7.5 g (28.09 kJ) meal of earthworms. At all test temperatures, resting metabolic rate typically remained above fasting levels for 1-4 h following ingestion of the high-protein earthworm diet. This protracted rise in metabolic rate, presumably associated with the biochemical costs of amino acid oxidation/gluconeogenesis and ureagenesis, averaged 12.8 % of the metabolizable energy and 8.7 % of the gross energy intake. Despite the potential thermoregulatory benefit, we found no evidence that biochemical HIF substitutes for facultative thermogenesis in star-nosed moles exposed to low air temperatures.",M1
10504308,"The development of a biological novelty: a different way to make appendages as revealed in the snout of the star-nosed mole Condylura cristata.The nose of the star-nosed mole Condylura cristata is a complex biological novelty consisting of 22 epidermal appendages. How did this new set of facial appendages arise? Recent studies find remarkable conservation of the genes expressed during appendage formation across phyla, suggesting that the basic mechanisms for appendage development are ancient. In the nose of these <e>moles</e>, however, we find a unique pattern of appendage morphogenesis, showing that evolution is capable of constructing appendages in different ways. During development, the nasal appendages of the mole begin as a series of waves in the epidermis. A second deep layer of epidermis then grows under these superficial epidermal waves to produce 22 separate, elongated epidermal cylinders embedded in the side of the mole's face. The caudal end of each cylinder later erupts from the face and rotates forward to project rostrally, remaining attached only at the tip of the snout. As a result of this unique 'unfolding' formation, the rostral end of each adult appendage is derived from caudal embryonic facial tissue, while the caudal end of each appendage is derived from rostral facial tissue. This developmental process has essentially no outgrowth phase and results in the reversal of the original embryonic orientation of each appendage. This differs from the development of other known appendages, which originate either as outgrowths of the body wall or from subdivisions of outgrowths (e.g. tetrapod digits). Adults of a different mole species (Scapanus townsendii) exhibit a star-like pattern that resembles an embryonic stage of the star-nosed mole, suggesting that the development of the star recapitulates stages of its evolution.",M1
10501021,"Fasting metabolism and thermoregulatory competence of the star-nosed mole, Condylura cristata (Talpidae: Condylurinae).Metabolic and body temperature (Tb) responses of star-nosed <e>moles</e> (Condylura cristata) exposed to air temperatures ranging from 0 to 33 degrees C were investigated. The thermoneutral zone of this semi-aquatic mole extended from 24.5 to 33 degrees C, over which its basal rate of metabolism averaged 2.25 ml O2 g-1 h-1 (45.16 J g-1 h-1). This rate of metabolism is higher than predicted for terrestrial forms, and substantially higher than for other moles examined to date. Minimum thermal conductance was nearly identical to that predicted for similar-sized eutherians and may represent a compromise between the need to dissipate heat while digging and foraging in subterranean burrows, and the need to conserve heat and avoid hypothermia during exposure to cold. C. cristata precisely regulated Tb (mean +/- SE = 37.7 +/- 0.05 degrees C) over the entire range of test temperatures. Over three separate 24-h periods, Tb of a radio-implanted mole varied from 36.6 to 38.8 degrees C, and generally tracked level of activity. No obvious circadian variation in Tb and activity was apparent, although cyclic 2-4 h intervals of activity punctuated by periods of inactivity lasting 3-5 h were routinely observed. We suggest that the elevated basal metabolic rate and relatively high Tb of star-nosed moles may reflect the semi-aquatic habits of this unique talpid.",M1
9916009,"Testis-like steroidogenesis in the ovotestis of the European mole, Talpa europaea.The female European mole (Talpa europaea) presents a vivid paradox in relation to our contemporary understanding of mammalian sexual differentiation. These animals are exceptional among female mammals in that they possess bilateral ovotestes. The ovotestis contains a morphologically normal ovarian component that develops during the spring breeding season and a histologically defined testicular region, the interstitial gland, which enlarges during autumn when the ovarian component decreases in size. In correlation with this unusual gonadal situation, the female mole displays a penile clitoris traversed by a urethral canal. Although the histology of the ovotestis is well documented and has recently been extended to an additional three species of the genus Talpa, there have been no clear indications of the physiological function, particularly androgen production, of the ovotestis in these female <e>moles</e>. This paper presents the first clear evidence of seasonal variation in plasma testosterone concentrations, which parallel the growth and regression of the  testicular  interstitial gland, in T. europaea. Plasma androstenedione did not show significant seasonal variation, but plasma testosterone (1.06 +/- 0.2 ng/ml) and gonadal testosterone concentration (1.57 +/- 0.65 microgram/mg protein) in females in autumn were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.02) than plasma (0.4 +/- 0.2 ng/ml) and gonadal (0.24 +/- 0.21 microgram/mg) concentrations in pregnant or immediately postpartum females in spring. Our data also reveal selective metabolic production of testosterone from radiolabeled steroid precursors (progesterone and androstenedione) by these ovarian interstitial tissues and male testes; estradiol is produced by ovarian tissue but not interstitial gland or testis.",M1

9034895,"Organization of somatosensory cortex and distribution of corticospinal neurons in the eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus).The somatotopic organization of somatosensory cortex of the eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus) was explored with multiunit microelectrode recordings from middle layers of cortex. The recordings revealed the presence of at least parts of two systematic representations of the body surface in the lateral cortex. One of the representations appears to be primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and it contained cytochrome oxidase dark regions, separated by light septa that formed isomorphs with some body parts. The rostral portion of this presumptive S1 cortex contained a face representation with a series of barrel-like cytochrome oxidase dark ovals that corresponded to the vibrissae on the snout. In caudolateral S1, light septa outline the palm and digits of the forepaw. Cortex caudal to S1, in the expected region of auditory cortex, responded to vibration, suggesting a modification of auditory cortex. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase into the cervical enlargement of the spinal cord revealed two dense foci of cortical cells that project to the spinal cord. The focus medial to the face region in S1 may correspond to primary motor cortex (M1). The second focus was coextensive with the somatosensory representation of the forelimb and the trunk in S1. The dense corticospinal projections from the forelimb representation of S1 and motor cortex may reflect sensorimotor specializations related to digging behaviors in <e>moles</e>.",M1

After ingestion the primary symptoms were burning retrosternal pain, severe vomiting and diarrhoea which progressed to cardiac failure, arrhythmias and severe metabolic acidosis. The patient and his excreta smelled of garlic, ammonium carbide and decaying fish, which is characteristic of this poisoning. In spite of intensive care support the patient died in cardiac and respiratory failure 17 hours after ingestion of the pellets. Treatment is supportive.

8858598,"Females of four mole species of genus Talpa (insectivora, mammalia) are true hermaphrodites with ovotestes.We studied the anatomical, histological, and genetic features of the sexual tract in four European mole species of the genus Talpa (Insectivora, mammalia): T. occidentalis, T. europaea, T. romana, and T. stankovici. All XY individuals had a normal male phenotype, whereas all XX individuals in all four species had features that identified them as intersexes. These individuals were nonetheless presumed to be functionally fertile females. Intersexuality was manifested mainly as gonadal hermaphroditism, with all females possessing bilateral ovotestes. The gonads were composed of a small portion of histologically normal ovarian tissue and a variably sized, generally large mass of disgenetic testicular tissue, accompanied by a small, rudimentary epididymis. The rest of the sexual tract was typically female, including oviducts, uterus, and vagina of normal appearance. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blotting analyses showed that the mammalian testis-determining gene SRY is present in males but not in females. Part of the conserved sequence of the mole SRY gene was cloned and sequenced after PCR amplification in two of the four mole species (T. occidentalis from Spain and T. romana from Italy). Sequences were identical in these two species and were very similar to those of the human and mouse SRY gene. Our findings constitute the first evidence of the existence of a genus-specific case of true hermaphroditism, probably due to a very ancient mutation that fixed in populations of the ancestral species from which contemporary <e>moles</e> evolved. The possible nature of this mutation is discussed with regard to the cytologic, histologic, and genetic features of the gonads in Talpa females.",M1
8762333,"Genetic conflicts and the paradox of sex determination: three paths to the evolution of female intersexuality in a mammal.That sex determining systems ever change is paradoxical but can be explained by noting that conflict between selfish elements and their modifiers will often cause a shift in sex determining strategy. The evolution of the novel sex determining system of <e>moles</e> (Talpa europaea and T. occidentalis) may, we argue, be an example of just such a process. Three different models for the evolution of female intersexuality are presented. These all attempt to account for (1) the fact that a few years ago populations of moles had high frequencies of sterile XX individuals that were either morphologically male or intersex (other XX individuals were normal females) and (2) that presently, the XX individuals in the same population are exclusively fertile intersexes that are functionally female; i.e. have follicle producing ovotestes. This case history is compared to that of the wood lemming and two similarities are discussed. First, in both cases it is noted that one end product could be approached from different routes. Second, selfish elements may be involved in the evolution of both systems. In general, it is suggested that XY sex determination, far from being resilient to evolutionary change, is vulnerable to take-over by selfish elements. This is particularly the case in mammals in which transplacental interactions could allow manipulation of sex determination in one foetus by another. This, we also suggest, is a good candidate explanation for the evolution of novel sex determination in Talpa.",M1
8742693,"Ovotestis variability in young and adult females of the mole Talpa occidentalis (insectivora, mammalia).The age-related evolution and ontogenic origin of the ovotestes in fertile females of the Spanish mole (Talpa occidentalis) were studied. Volume of the ovotestis and its ovarian and testicular components, size of the epididymis and testicular cords, number of ovarian follicles and testicular cords, uterus weight, and age index were analyzed statistically in a large sample of young and adult individuals of this species. Comparison of means and linear correlation analyses were done. Most variables were shown to be age dependent, with a period of rapid change during puberty. In adult animals, volume of the ovarian portion and uterus weight followed a seasonal cycle of sexual activity. Interindividual variability was evident in most of the variables investigated except for the number of testicular cords per ovotestis, which remained unchanged throughout the animal's life and hence was not inversely correlated with the number of ovarian follicles. This finding ruled out an ovary-testis transdifferentiation hypothesis for the ontogenic origin of the testicular tissue in the ovotestes of female <e>moles</e>. An alternative hypothesis based in the absence of oocytes in a portion of the undifferentiated fetal gonad is proposed in accordance with a new general model for mammalian sex determination.",M1

One pattern obtained by restriction enzyme analysis of the virulence plasmid was observed in 20 isolates from 11 human patients and 9 wild rodents, and the other was observed in 2 isolates from 1 human patient and 1 wild rodent.

7615872,"A comparison of the Eimer's organs of three North American <e>moles</e>: the hairy-tailed mole (Parascalops breweri), the star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata), and the eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus).Eimer's organ is a tactile sensory structure found predominantly on the snouts of moles. It consists of a raised papilla of epidermis containing a column of cells associated with sensory receptors. This study compares the Eimer's organs of the hairy-tailed mole, Parascalops breweri, the star-nosed mole, Condylura cristata, and the eastern mole, Scalopus aquaticus, by using scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. Eimer's organs are visible on the snout of the hairy-tailed and the star-nosed moles, but not the eastern mole. The Eimer's organs of the hairy-tailed mole are similar in external appearance, distribution, and internal structure to those found in most species examined. The Eimer's organs of the star-nosed mole and the eastern mole diverge from this basic form in seemingly opposite directions. The Eimer's organs of the star-nosed mole are more numerous, smaller, and highly organized units with a consistent pattern of neuronal terminal swellings within a cell column, below a thin keratinized epidermis. By contrast, the Eimer's organs of the eastern mole lie below a thick keratinized epidermis, are less organized in structure, and have no central cell column. The extreme differences between the Eimer's organs of the star-nosed mole and thos of the eastern mole may be the result of the habitat of each species, saturated mud allowing a more elaborate and delicate sensory apparatus in the star-nosed mole and drier soil requiring a thick keratinized epidermis over the organ in the eastern mole.",M1
7721983,"Organization of the somatosensory cortex of the star-nosed mole.The nose of the star-nosed mole consists of a star-like array of 22 fleshy appendages that radiate from the nostrils and are moved about to explore the environment. The surface of each appendage, or ray, is densely packed with bulbous receptor organs (Eimer's organs) that are highly responsive to tactile stimulation. Here, we report that these rays have corresponding morphological specializations in somatosensory cortex. Using a stain for the metabolic enzyme, cytochrome oxidase (CO), to reveal subdivisions of cortex, we disclosed a complex pattern of CO-dense stripes or bands separated by sharp lines or septa of low CO staining. Multiunit microelectrode recordings of neural activity evoked by light tactile stimuli in somatosensory cortex of anesthetized <e>moles</e> allowed us to mark some of the bands and other CO-dark regions with small electrolytic lesions and later relate recording results to the CO pattern. The results suggest that the primary somatosensory cortex, S1, has an unusual ventrolateral location and orientation with representations of mouth, nose rays, facial vibrissae, forepaw, and trunk in a rostrocaudal sequence. Within this presumptive S1, the 11 rays of the contralateral nose are represented as a rostral-to-caudal cortical pinwheel of 11 stripes. Cortex ventral to the primary set of stripes contains a second rostrocaudal representation of the rays as a mirror image of the first. This second set of stripes may be part of the second somatosensory area, S2. A third pattern of CO stripes appears to merge partially with caudal stripes of the first two patterns, so that a full pattern of 11 stripes is not obvious. This representation may correspond to the ventral somatosensory area, VS, of other mammals. An extensive area of cortex separated from the nose by a large septum was responsive to stimulation of the forelimb. Auditory cortex is unusually caudal in this mole, and the presumptive primary visual area is relatively small. These specializations of somatosensory cortex in star-nosed moles may be more patent examples of the consequences of more general factors in brain development. The observations are consistent with the general rule that the terminations of sensory projections with discorrelated activity segregate.",M1
7830994,"Microvasculature of the lingual papillae in primates and insectivores--fungiform, vallate and foliate papillae.The microvascular architecture of the fungiform, vallate and foliate papillae was investigated under scanning electron microscope in man, common squirrel monkeys, common marmosets, common tree shrews (primates), large Japanese <e>moles</e> and dwarf shrews (insectivores) utilizing microvascular corrosion casts. The fungiform papilla of the lingual apex in man was supplied by an intrapapillary capillary network with a globular pattern. It was composed of 10-15 capillary loops in a circular arrangement and 5-7 thick capillaries in the center. The fungiform papilla of the lingual body was supplied by a dense capillary network on the top and lateral surfaces. That in other primates was supplied by a cylindrical capillary network and loop formation was seen on the top surface. That in insectivores was supplied by a thin cylindrical network with coarse meshes, at the tips of which were observed 2 or 3 capillary rings in the mole and only one in the dwarf shrew. The vallate papilla in primates was supplied by an intrapapillary capillary network with a globular pattern, and showed irregularly tortuous capillary loops on its top surface. The vallum was supplied by a capillary network in man and usually one or two rows of loops arranged in a circle in other primates. The vallate papilla in insectivores was supplied by a doughnut-like capillary network with a recess on the top surface, and an indistinctly low vallum by a low undulating network. The foliate papillae were most developed in man, and each lobule was supplied by capillaries passing longitudinal to it and capillary loops in 5-10 regular rows on the top, but 3-5 rudimentary lobules in the squirrel monkey and marmoset. In the two species, each lobule was supplied by one arteriole, one venule and a coarse capillary network continuing from the interpapillary network.

A cyto-architectonic study revealed that the SCN is well developed, even though other visual nuclei in the dorsal thalamus and the midbrain are not. An immunohistochemical study showed that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-like immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were distributed in the SCN, as has been reported in other mammals. Following intraocular injections of wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), the central retinal projections were examined. The results indicated that the SCN receives a direct projection from the retina, as seen in many other mammals. In addition to the projection to the SCN, retinal fibers were seen to terminate in the anterior hypothalamic region and the retrochiasmatic area, as observed in some other mammals. In moles, retinohypothalamic projections are bilateral, with an ipsilateral predominance. Considering that the retinogeniculate and retinotectal projections are vestigial, it is highly probable that the optic pathway in moles primarily consists of retinohypothalamic projections, which are devoted to the entrainment of circadian and circannual rhythms.",M1

The P+ Y. pseudotuberculosis strains were recovered at less than 10(4) cells per g of the cecal contents.

2408075,"The Chrysochloridae: studies toward a broader perspective of adaptation in subterranean mammals.Earliest chrysochlorids (from the Miocene) resemble contemporary members of the family. Unlike talpids, chrysochlorids have eyes covered with skin; pick-like foreclaws; a blunt, padded rostrum; and no external tail. Golden <e>moles</e> are an ancient lineage of mammals (related to tenrecs) with many unique features; it has been suggested that the Chrysochloridae constitute a separate order, the Chrysochloridea. In contrast, a constancy of structure within the group belies the wide range in habitat of the various species (including grassland, forest, and shifting desert sands), in contrast to the aquatic desmans and shrew-like talpids. Some species of golden mole are able to disperse over large distances, being accomplished swimmers (as are talpids) and having a wide range of diet; nonetheless, populations and species are patchily distributed throughout the range of the family (Africa south of the Sahara whereas talpids occur in the northern hemisphere). Diversity of chrysochlorid species is greatest in Southern Africa, from which emigrations to the north probably occurred. Although solitary, there is little evidence for competitive exclusion between the chrysochlorids, rhizomyids, or the more social and aggressive bathyergid rodent moles to explain the high incidence of endemism. Low litter sizes are indicative of the few predators known to effectively prey on golden moles. Physical factors which might restrict species from an area (such as food shortages and temperature extremes) may be overcome by becoming torpid, an ability unknown for other subterranean mammals. Clustering of largely immobile food resources and friable soils appear to be the major factors influencing chrysochlorid distribution. There is substantial need for basic studies on all aspects of the biology of chrysochlorids for a better understanding of evolutionary processes within the family, which will in turn contribute to a broader understanding and more balanced view of evolutionary processes in all subterranean mammals.",M1
2408073,"Adaptiveness of tunnel system features in subterranean mammal burrows.Most <e>moles</e> and mole rats spend their lifetimes within the confines of tunnel walls, constructing, maintaining, and modifying burrow system structure in response to changing external circumstances and changing internal needs. Thus, anatomy, physiology, behavior, and distribution are all greatly affected by the burrow environment, with temperature, humidity, gas concentrations, living space, availability of food and mating partners, and protection from flooding and predation all being influenced by burrow architecture. Regrettably, the burrow structure of almost all subterranean mammals is unknown, or known only from several incomplete excavations. Moreover, existing data is often vague without any mention of particular structures or surrounding habitat, which makes the placing of burrow structure in an adaptive perspective difficult. Reasons for these short-comings are understandable: excavations require laborious excavation which can extend for hundreds of meters, reaching depths in excess of a meter; it is often difficult to remove the occupant prior to excavation which avoids modification of the system by the animal during excavation; particular types of subterranean mammals are limited in distribution to particular continents so that the literature is often localized and a global perspective difficult to obtain; and there is no standardization of terms relating to burrow structure, making intergroup comparison confusing. This paper addresses the above difficulties and encourages further investigation in this central area of study by making obvious the paucity of information for most subterranean mammals, presenting a synopsis of known burrow structures of major groups which will make particular gaps in our knowledge evident, providing a bibliography of major papers on burrow structure with coverage of most moles and mole rats, establishing a checklist of burrow features to better analyze future excavations and facilitate intergroup comparison, and lastly, to indicate possible adaptive significance of various burrow features to promote further observation, speculation and experimentation.",M1

2531692,"The testes of <e>moles</e> (Talpa europaea) retain a considerable microsomal capacity for androgen synthesis during seasonal regression.Seasonal changes in testicular histology and steroidogenesis were investigated in the mole (Talpa europaea). Androgen synthesis was examined by incubating [4-14C]pregnenolone (P) and [4-14C]dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA) with testicular minces in a static incubation system. The metabolites formed were characterized by thin-layer chromatography. Morphological changes were studied by routine histological methods. During sexual quiescence spermatogenesis was arrested. The regressive seminiferous tubules consisted predominantly of Sertoli cells and spermatogonia. On the other hand, histological quantification suggested that season has no significant effects on the number or the nuclear dimensions of Leydig cells in this species. The capacity of the regressive testes (per unit weight) to metabolize P and DHA to testosterone (T) was somewhat greater in regressive (48.5%, 49.4%) than in active (33.2%, 41.6%) testes. The results also suggest that the greater in vitro T production encountered during reproductive quiescence is due possibly to an increase in the activity of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (per unit weight). Our data on Leydig cell numbers indicate, however, that the capacity of the individual Leydig cells to produce T is decreased during sexual regression. T. europaea appears to be quite exceptional among seasonally breeding small mammals exhibiting pronounced annual changes in spermatogenesis in that the testes retain a considerable enzymatic capacity to produce testosterone from pregnanes during sexual quiescence. The results suggest that pituitary as well as paracrine regulation of the annual testicular cycle in this species differs from that generally encountered in seasonal breeders.",M1

The HRP-labeled axons were found to be ipsilaterally terminated in the trigeminal motor nucleus, supratrigeminal nucleus and trigeminal main and spinal tract nuclei, lateral pontine-medullary reticular formation, vagal dorsal motor and hypoglossal nuclei and the lamina V of the C2 spinal cord segments. No HRP-labeled axons were found in the facial and solitary nuclei and the cerebellum. Also, the functional localization of the trigeminal mesencephalic tract neurons was analyzed with the retrograde tracers of fluorescent compounds injected into the jaw-closing muscles having spindles. The fluorescent-labeled neurons were found to be intermingled throughout the nucleus and clustered at the caudal level of the nucleus. Also, double or triple fluorescent-labeled neurons were not observed in the nucleus. The HRP-labeled axon bundle of the facial proprioceptive neurons are divided rostro-caudally into the shorter ascending and the longer descending roots, both running closely dorsal to the trigeminal spinal tract nucleus. The ascending root lies adjacently dorsal to the spinal tract nucleus, giving off the terminal fibers to it, to the wider area of the dorso-medial pontine nuclei and finally to the cerebellar nuclei. At the level of the facial inner genu, it turns medially to meet the facial nerve root, giving off the terminal fibers to the facial motor nucleus and to the raphe nuclei and to the opposite nuclei bilaterally. The HRP-labeled descending root takes the course caudally at least down to the C3 segment of the spinal cord, giving off the terminal fibers to the spinal tract nucleus, the nuclei of the IXth, Xth and XIIth cranial nerves and the pontine-medullary reticular formation.

The animals were subjected to unilateral and bilateral infraorbital nerve transection. Transganglionic degeneration was studied by the Nauta method and electron microscopy including HRP application to the neck muscles.

Transganglionic degeneration of the fibers was found not only in the main sensory nucleus and spinal tract nucleus of the trigeminal nerve but throughout the cervical and the upper part of the thoracic spinal cord. 2. These transganglionically degenerated fibers descended bilaterally through the cuneate nucleus and then caudally through the posterior funiculus at the obex level. They then entered the dorsal and ventral horns to make a synaptic contact with the degenerated synapses on the dorsal horn cells and with the multipolar cells in the ventral horns. This neuroanatomical information suggests: 1) that the trigemino-neck muscle reflex will be generated monosynaptically by the primary neurons arising from the snout sensory organs and 2) that these primary neurons may play a large role as a neuronal bridge in connecting the masticatory reflex system and the cranio-neck reflex system.",M1

463791,"Morphogenesis of the fetal membranes of an American mole, Scalopus aquaticus.Scalopus membranes are characterized by: Superficial nidation; antimesometrial orientation of the embryonic disc; amniogenesis by folding; an extensive but transitory choriovitelline placenta; a large yolk sac with late and incomplete inversion; large persistent allantoic vesicle; a very broad, thin, villous, epitheliochorial chorioallantoic placenta of annular shape interrupted mesometrially, dotted with numerous areolae, and bordered by a nonvillous sparsely vascular chorioallantoic membrane connected with the persistent bilaminar omphalopleure by a very narrow rim of chorion. There is no decidua. Electron microscopy shows that at 8 mm, CR, (limb bud embryo) the uterine epithelium of the interhemal membrane may be 0.5 micron or less in thickness, but that it shows no signs of degeneration. Trophoblastic microvilli often penetrate the epithelium to within 0.2 micron of its base. At this time there is active secretion by the uterine glands, and cellular hypertrophy and cytolysis of the epithelium at the gland mouths, with active phagocytosis by the areolar cytotrophoblast. The occurrence of absorptive areolae in an insectivore emphasizes the probable primitiveness of this widely distributed placental mechanism. In spite of similarities of the yolk sac to that of rabbits and rodents, the bilaminar omphalopleure produces no invasive trophoblastic giant cells. The definitive membranes of Parascalops breweri and Scapanus latimanus are like those of Scalopus. The placentae of Talpa europaea, Condylura cristata, and Neurotrichus gibbsii are discoid and relatively much smaller, thicker and more complex in internal structure.

During sexual activity, the Leydig cells contain abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), mitochondria with tubular cristae, and lipid droplets. Some areas of the cytoplasm are occupied exclusively by tubular SER, arranged in parallel. During regression the SER appears tortuous, and large lipid droplets are found in the cytoplasm, although these gradually become smaller.

In the sexually active animal, spermatozoa mature during their passage through the epididymis and the structure of the cells lining the duct suggests a clear regional division into initial, middle and terminal segments. Numerous intra-epithelial vesicles were present in the distal part of the middle segment of sexually active moles and the lining epithelium in the terminal segment appeared to be secretory. Variation in the sensitivity of different regions of the epididymis to androgens was apparent: the principal cells of the initial segment were morphologically active only during the peak of the breeding season in spring, while the cells of the terminal segment became active earlier and remained so for longer. During sexual regression, many autophagic vacuoles were found in the principal cells, and these became transformed into lipofuscin pigment granules. Cells heavily laden with these granules appeared concurrently in the lining epithelium. It is suggested that such cells may be involved in the regression of principal cells by means of heterophagic activity. A similar situation was also observed, but to a lesser extent, at the beginning of the breeding season. Outside the breeding season, the organelles of the principal cells were poorly developed throughout the epididymis, and lipofuscin pigment granules remained in the principal and basal cells of adults.

All patients who have atypical moles should be counselled about sun avoidance, screening of family members, and regular skin checks at least once per year. Total body photography and dermoscopy can aid in regular skin monitoring for changes in atypical moles and the emergence of new lesions. The presence of multiple atypical moles increases the risk of melanoma. The greatest risk of melanoma is in patients who have more than 50 atypical moles and two or more family members with melanoma (familial atypical mole and melanoma syndrome). Atypical moles should be removed when they have features suggestive of malignant transformation. Elliptical excision is the preferred removal technique. Removing all atypical moles is neither necessary nor cost effective.",M2
18534076,"Evaluation of the MoleMate training program for assessment of suspicious pigmented lesions in primary care.BACKGROUND: Pigmented skin lesions or '<e>moles</e>' are a common presenting problem in general practice consultations: while the majority are benign, a minority are malignant melanomas. The MoleMate system is a novel diagnostic tool which incorporates spectrophotometric intracutaneous analysis (SIAscopy) within a non-invasive scanning technique and utilises a diagnostic algorithm specifically developed for use in primary care. The MoleMate training program is a short, computer-based course developed to train primary care practitioners to operate the MoleMate diagnostic tool. OBJECTIVES: This pre-trial study used mixed methods to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of a computer-based training program CD-ROM, developed to teach primary care practitioners to identify the seven features of suspicious pigmented lesions (SPLs) seen with the MoleMate system. METHOD: Twenty-five practitioners worked through the MoleMate training program: data on feature recognition and time taken to conduct the assessment of each lesion were collected. Acceptability of the training program and the MoleMate system in general was assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: The MoleMate training program improved users' feature recognition by 10% (pre-test median 73.8%, p&lt;0.001), and reduced the time taken to complete assessment of 30 SPLs (pre-test median 21 minutes 53 seconds, median improvement 3 minutes 17 seconds, p&lt;0.001). All practitioners' feature recognition improved (21/21), with most also improving their time (18/21). Practitioners rated the training program as effective and easy to use. CONCLUSION: The MoleMate training program is a potentially effective and acceptable informatics tool to teach practitioners to recognise the features of SPLs identified by the MoleMate system. It will be used as part of the intervention in a randomised controlled trial to compare the diagnostic accuracy and appropriate referral rates of practitioners using the MoleMate system with best practice in primary care.",M2

METHODS: This population-based study of digital photography and dermoscopy of the child's back (overview, close-up, and dermoscopic images) and genetic specimens took place among fifth graders in the Framingham, Massachusetts School System. Schoolchildren and their parents completed baseline surveys on sun protection practices, sunburns, and past ultraviolet exposures, including summer and vacation experiences. RESULTS: Prestudy outreach was conducted with children, parents, nurses, administrators, and pediatricians. Of the 691 Framingham families with a fifth grader (aged 10-11), 443 consented to complete surveys and undergo digital photography and dermoscopy during the school's routine scoliosis testing. Of the 443 families providing consent, 369 agreed to genetic testing. We identified key factors to consider when implementing school-based studies: (a) pilot studies to demonstrate feasibility, (b) inclusion of school administration and parents, (c) grassroots approach with multiple contacts, and (d) embedding research studies within preexisting school health services. CONCLUSIONS: Launching an observational study within the school environment required an academic/school collaboration across numerous disciplines including dermatology, epidemiology, genetics, medical photography, school health, community health education, and most notably, the need for the presence of a full-time study nurse in the school. A large school system proved to be an excellent resource to conduct this first prospective study on the evolution of moles in US schoolchildren.

The adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.34 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14-0.80) for those with the highest adulthood recreational sun exposure, relative to the lowest. The OR for any freckles, compared to none, was 2.24 (95% CI = 1.18-4.25). We found a linear relationship between the number of benign moles and the presence of atypical moles (p for trend = 0.0001). The OR was 7.34 (95% CI = 3.03-17.80) for &gt; 15 benign moles, relative to 0-4.

16880792,"Cellular senescence in naevi and immortalisation in melanoma: a role for p16?Cellular senescence, the irreversible proliferative arrest seen in somatic cells after a limited number of divisions, is considered a crucial barrier to cancer, but direct evidence for this in vivo was lacking until recently. The best-known form of human cell senescence is attributed to telomere shortening and a DNA-damage response through p53 and p21. There is also a more rapid form of senescence, dependent on the p16-retinoblastoma pathway. p16 (CDKN2A) is a known melanoma susceptibility gene. Here, we use retrovirally mediated gene transfer to confirm that the normal form of senescence in cultured human melanocytes involves p16, since disruption of the p16/retinoblastoma pathway is required as well as telomerase activation for immortalisation. Expression (immunostaining) patterns of senescence mediators and markers in melanocytic lesions provide strong evidence that cell senescence occurs in benign melanocytic naevi (<e>moles</e>) in vivo and does not involve p53 or p21 upregulation, although p16 is widely expressed. In comparison, dysplastic naevi and early (radial growth-phase, RGP) melanomas show less p16 and some p53 and p21 immunostaining. All RGP melanomas expressed p21, suggesting areas of p53-mediated senescence, while most areas of advanced (vertical growth-phase) melanomas lacked both p16 and p21, implying escape from both forms of senescence (immortalisation). Moreover, nuclear p16 but not p21 expression can be induced in human melanocytes by oncogenic BRAF, as found in around 80% of naevi. We conclude that cell senescence can form a barrier to melanoma development. This also provides a potential explanation of why p16 is a melanoma suppressor gene.",M2

16130442,"[Etiologic factors of malignant melanoma in young adults]BACKGROUND: Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancers, involving the cutis and the mucosa. Its incidence keeps increasing dramatically in the last decades. It appears rarely in childhood. The main environmental risk factors are: excessive sun exposure and severe sunburns in both childhood and adolescence. Skin phototype, number of nevi, presence of congenital nevi (especially giant congenital nevi) and non-melanoma skin cancer in previous history refer to increased risk. Investigations of genetical factors have come to the front. The role of hormonal influences and traumas are recurring questions. AIM: The presence of melanoma typically concerns the middle-aged population. The purpose of this study was to determine the main risk factors, etiology factors and predisposing pediatric conditions in development of melanoma in young adulthood (under the age of 30). METHOD: A total of 70 new, histologically verified melanoma patient under 30 years were examined between 1993-2003 with a retrospective study. Results of questionnaire based survey and clinical data base about melanoma risk factors were also analysed. RESULTS: 5% of patients had giant congenital nevi, although in half of the patients (19/40) more than 20 <e>moles</e> were found. On the basis of patients' histories 57.5% of melanomas developed on a nevus existing from birth or childhood. 30% of melanomas developed on a pigmented brown alteration which rose on the normal skin. About 1/3 of patients had fair skin type and almost all patients (38/40) suffered from erythematous sunburn at first sunbath. Melanoma developed mostly on the trunk and lower extremities. 51.5% of patients belonged to Stage I (Breslow thickness below 1 mm in 33%). CONCLUSION: There were 70 young (under 30 years) patients were treated for malignant melanoma at the Dermatology Department of the National Institute of Oncology in Budapest from 1993 till 2003. The incidence of melanoma under the age of 30 was 3.3%. In young adulthood the main risk factors were the number of atypical nevi and repeated or severe sunburns in childhood. The skin type was also an important risk factor. 50% of the melanomas in young women developed on the trunk. Authors could not prove any relationship among hormonal factors, pregnancy and the development of the melanoma.",M2
16079850,"BRAFE600-associated senescence-like cell cycle arrest of human naevi.Most normal mammalian cells have a finite lifespan, thought to constitute a protective mechanism against unlimited proliferation. This phenomenon, called senescence, is driven by telomere attrition, which triggers the induction of tumour suppressors including p16(INK4a) (ref. 5). In cultured cells, senescence can be elicited prematurely by oncogenes; however, whether such oncogene-induced senescence represents a physiological process has long been debated. Human naevi (<e>moles</e>) are benign tumours of melanocytes that frequently harbour oncogenic mutations (predominantly V600E, where valine is substituted for glutamic acid) in BRAF, a protein kinase and downstream effector of Ras. Nonetheless, naevi typically remain in a growth-arrested state for decades and only rarely progress into malignancy (melanoma). This raises the question of whether naevi undergo BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence. Here we show that sustained BRAF(V600E) expression in human melanocytes induces cell cycle arrest, which is accompanied by the induction of both p16(INK4a) and senescence-associated acidic beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) activity, a commonly used senescence marker. Validating these results in vivo, congenital naevi are invariably positive for SA-beta-Gal, demonstrating the presence of this classical senescence-associated marker in a largely growth-arrested, neoplastic human lesion. In growth-arrested melanocytes, both in vitro and in situ, we observed a marked mosaic induction of p16(INK4a), suggesting that factors other than p16(INK4a) contribute to protection against BRAF(V600E)-driven proliferation. Naevi do not appear to suffer from telomere attrition, arguing in favour of an active oncogene-driven senescence process, rather than a loss of replicative potential. Thus, both in vitro and in vivo, BRAF(V600E)-expressing melanocytes display classical hallmarks of senescence, suggesting that oncogene-induced senescence represents a genuine protective physiological process.",M2

15894679,"Risk factors for melanoma by body site.It has been hypothesized that cutaneous melanoma at different anatomic sites develops through divergent pathways. We examined this hypothesis prospectively. We followed 152,949 women and 25,204 men free of cancer at baseline for up to 14 years in three large prospective studies. We examined risk factors for melanoma by anatomic location (head or neck, trunk, upper extremity, and lower extremity). Polytomous logistic regression was used to test the difference among risk factors by location of melanoma. A total of 511 incident cases of invasive melanoma (49 head or neck, 188 trunk, 98 upper extremity, and 176 lower extremity) were included in the analysis. Compared with females, males had a higher risk of developing melanoma on the head or neck and trunk. History of severe and painful sunburn was most strongly related to melanoma of upper extremity; individuals with &gt;10 burns had a 6.86-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.62-18.00) higher risk of melanoma of upper extremity compared with those with no burns (P for trend &lt; 0.0001; P for difference by body site = 0.04).

15761869,"Pigmentary characteristics and <e>moles</e> in relation to melanoma risk.Although benign and atypical moles are considered key melanoma risk factors, previous studies of their influence were small and/or institution-based. We conducted a population-based case-control study in the state of New Hampshire. Individuals of ages 20-69 with an incident diagnosis of first primary cutaneous melanoma were ascertained through the New Hampshire State Cancer Registry. Controls were identified through New Hampshire driver's license lists and frequency-matched by age and gender to cases. We interviewed 423 eligible cases and 678 eligible controls. Host characteristics, including mole counts, were evaluated using logistic regression analyses. Our results showed that pigmentary factors, including eye color (OR = 1.57 for blue eyes compared to brown), hair color (OR = 1.85 for blonde/red hair color compared to brown/black), freckles before age 15 (OR = 2.39 for freckles present compared to absent) and sun sensitivity (OR = 2.25 for peeling sunburn followed by no tan or a light tan and 2.42 for sunburn followed by tan compared to tanning immediately), were related to melanoma risk; these associations held after adjustment for sun-related factors and for moles. In analyses confined to skin examination participants, the covariate-adjusted effects of benign and atypical moles were moderately strong. Compared to 0-4 benign moles, risk increased steadily for 5-14 moles (OR = 1.71), 15-24 moles (OR = 3.55) and &gt;or= 25 moles (OR = 4.33). Risk also increased with the number of atypical moles; compared to none, the ORs for having 1, 2-3, or &gt;or= 4 atypical moles were 2.08, 1.84 and 3.80, respectively. Although risk was highest for those with multiple benign and atypical moles, the interaction was not of statistical significance. Our findings, arising from the first population- and incidence-based study to evaluate atypical moles in relation to melanoma risk, confirm the importance of host susceptibility, represented by pigmentary factors and the tendency to develop benign or atypical moles, in the etiology of this disease.",M2
15694309,"BRAF mutations are sufficient to promote nevi formation and cooperate with p53 in the genesis of melanoma.Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, and the incidence and mortality rates are rapidly rising. Epidemiologically, high numbers of nevi (<e>moles</e>) are associated with higher risk of melanoma . The majority of melanomas exhibit activating mutations in the serine/threonine kinase BRAF . BRAF mutations may be critical for the initiation of melanoma ; however, the direct role of BRAF in nevi and melanoma has not been tested in an animal model. To directly test the role of activated BRAF in nevus and melanoma development, we have generated transgenic zebrafish expressing the most common BRAF mutant form (V600E) under the control of the melanocyte mitfa promoter. Expression of mutant, but not wild-type, BRAF led to dramatic patches of ectopic melanocytes, which we have termed fish (f)-nevi. Remarkably, in p53-deficient fish, activated BRAF induced formation of melanocyte lesions that rapidly developed into invasive melanomas, which resembled human melanomas and could be serially transplanted. These data provide direct evidence that BRAF activation is sufficient for f-nevus formation, that BRAF activation is among the primary events in melanoma development, and that the p53 and BRAF pathways interact genetically to produce melanoma.",M2

15584541,"[Risk factors for skin melanoma: genetic factors probably more important than exposure to sunlight]Pigmented naevi (<e>moles</e>) are increasingly regarded as risk factors for the development of melanoma. The probability of melanoma developing from congenital naevi is proportional to the volume of the naevi. The risk of melanoma development from large naevi (diameter &gt; 20 cm) is already present in the early years of childhood. The most important risk factor is the higher number of acquired naevi. This applies particularly to dysplastic (also called clinically atypical) naevi that not only represent the highest risk group but are also considered potential melanoma precursors. The development of acquired naevi (including dysplastic naevi) is dependant on the degree of skin pigmentation. The role of sunlight (ultraviolet radiation) in the development of melanoma is less significant than is generally assumed. The indirect effect of sunlight on melanoma development is to stimulate naevogenesis. One of the risk-modifying genes is the gene coding for melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R). The presence of some gene variants has been found to lead to changes in melanin synthesis and is associated with a higher risk of melanoma. Recent research has shown that dysplastic naevi synthesise more phaeomelanin. There are also strong indications that dysplastic naevus cells suffer from chronic oxidative stress. This situation can lead to hypermutability and genetical instability.",M2

The American Cancer Society's  ABCD  rules are useful for differentiating a benign nevus from malignant melanoma. While acanthosis nigricans may signal an underlying malignancy (e.g., gastrointestinal tumor), it more often is associated with insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome) or obesity. Melasma is a facial hyperpigmentation resulting from the stimulation of melanocytes by endogenous or exogenous estrogen. Treatments for melasma include bleaching agents, laser therapy, and a new medication that combines hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide. Lesions that develop on the shins of patients with diabetic dermopathy often resolve spontaneously; no treatment is effective or recommended. Tinea versicolor responds to treatment with selenium sulfide shampoo and topical or oral antifungal agents.

14511439,"Linkage and association analysis of radiation damage repair genes XRCC3 and XRCC5 with nevus density in adolescent twins.Previous studies have shown that a deficiency in DNA damage repair is associated with increased cancer risk, and exposure to UV radiation is a major risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma. High density of common nevi (<e>moles</e>) is a major risk factor for cutaneous melanoma. A nevus may result from a mutation in a single UV-exposed melanocyte which failed to repair DNA damage in one or more critical genes. XRCC3 and XRCC5 may have an effect on nevus count through their function as components of DNA repair processes that may be involved directly or indirectly in the repair of DNA damage due to UV radiation. This study aims to test the hypothesis that the frequency of flat or raised moles is associated with polymorphism at or near these DNA repair genes, and that certain alleles are associated with less efficient DNA repair, and greater nevus density. Twins were recruited from schools in south eastern Queensland and were examined close to their 12th birthday. Nurses examined each individual and counted all moles on the entire body surface. A 10cM genome scan of 274 families (642 individuals) was performed and microsatellite polymorphisms in XRCC3 and adjacent to XRCC5 were also typed. Linkage and association of nevus count to these loci were tested simultaneously using a structural-equation modeling approach implemented in MX. There is weak evidence for linkage of XRCC5 to a QTL influencing raised mole count, and also weak association. There is also weak evidence for association between flat mole count and XRCC3. No tests were significant after correction for testing multiple alleles, nor were any of the tests for total association significant. If variation in XRCC3 or XRCC5 influences UV sensitivity, and indirectly affects nevus density, then the effects are small.",M2
12602964,"The 'common mole' from the point of view of digital dermoscopy analysis: subjective vs. objective evaluation of easy pigmented skin lesions.BACKGROUND: The term 'common mole', often used to describe a subset of benign pigmented skin lesions, is traditionally defined on the basis of morpho-chromatic features. In recent years, certain research groups have developed equipment and methods, such as digital dermoscopy analysis, that enable objective evaluation of pigmented skin lesions. OBJECTIVE: In this study we use a digital dermoscopy analyser trained for the recognition of pigmented skin lesions to compare the subjective definition of 'common' and the mathematical concept of 'close to the mean of measurements'. METHODS: A subset (100) of digital images of flat pigmented lesions, obtained in daily practice, were classified by trained and non-expert clinicians as common <e>moles</e> (60) or clear-cut melanoma (40), and processed with a DB-Mips analyser. The resulting parameters, validated by a classifier, were used to evaluate Hotelling's T2 multivariate distances from the mean.

12548604,"Moderate sun exposure and nevus counts in parents are associated with development of melanocytic nevi in childhood: a risk factor study in 1,812 kindergarten children.BACKGROUND: Melanocytic nevi have been identified as the most important risk factor for cutaneous melanoma. Sun exposure, sunburns, and light pigmentation have been found to be associated with their development in childhood. To the authors' knowledge, nevus proneness of parents and the exact type of ultraviolet (UV) exposure have not yet been investigated in this context. The authors' objective was to determine independent risk factors and their impact for nevus development in childhood. METHODS: The current study was conducted by two university departments of dermatology in 49 public nursery schools in Stuttgart, Germany and in 38 public nursery schools in Bochum, Germany. The cross-sectional study included 1,812 children aged 2-7 years and their parents. Total body nevus counts in children, assessment of pigmentary features, and nevus counts on the arms of parents were performed. Parents underwent a standardized interview concerning national origin and lifestyle features, as well as habits and magnitude of sun exposure of children. Analysis was performed by multivariate linear regression analysis and by multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The number of nevi was found to steadily increase with age from a median of 3 at age 2 years to 19 at age 7 years (P &lt; 0.0001). High numbers of nevi in children were associated with the number of weeks on sunny holidays, outdoor activities at home, skin type, facial freckling, ethnicity of parents, and the number of nevi on the arms of parents. Previously experienced sunburns failed significance (P = 0.0620). CONCLUSIONS: The authors found a strong association between nevus development in children and the number of parental <e>moles</e>, which most likely points to an inherited factor. Moderate sun exposure such as outdoor activities during a German summer without sunburns seemed to be sufficient for induction of melanocytic nevi. The authors believe that these findings will have direct impact on concepts for preventive strategies.",M2
11253119,"A distinctive melanocytic lesion associated with melanoma-prone dysplastic naevus syndrome: the hybrid naevus.Clinically and histologically, the concept of dysplastic nevi remains controversial. To elaborate more precise criteria for the nevi of patients with dysplastic naevus syndrome (DNS), we examined 58 nevi from seven DNS patients who developed one or several malignant melanomas. Clinical presentation and histomorphology were evaluated, and immunohistochemistry was performed using proliferation marker Ki-S5 and antibody DO-7 to the p53 protein. Sixty nevi from individuals without history of melanoma served as controls. Of the DNS nevi, 21 (36.2%) exhibited no morphological particularities. The remaining 37 nevi presented distinctive histological features consisting of a slight epidermal acanthosis, spitzoid vertically oriented nests of dyscohesive nevus cells, and single-standing atypical melanocytes in the basal cell layer of the epidermis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an average proliferation index of 2.5%, which significantly surpassed the mean growth fraction of conventional dysplastic nevi (&lt;1%). No increase in p53 expression was observed. Characteristically, active proliferation was found in junctional single-standing melanocytes with or without nuclear atypia rather than in nest-shaped compounds. In conclusion, certain <e>moles</e> of patients with DNS possess distinctive features. The newly characterized criteria may provide a basis for the diagnosis of DNS and might help to identify patients at increased risk for malignant melanoma by examination of a single biopsy.",M2

Images were acquired by a charge-coupled device camera using eight narrow-band filters ranging from 450 nm to 800 nm, at 50-nm intervals. To extract main features of these tumors, principal components analysis (PCA) was performed, because it projects the multidimensional (here, eight-dimensional) data in the direction of maximum data variance. Then, the primary PCA components for red, green, and blue subset images were analyzed in terms of hue-saturation-intensity (HSI). By hue distributions, the BCCs and SCCs were differentiated from the MMs and normal moles. Texture information was used to further classify tumor types after the HSI analysis. The texture analysis, performed using a spatial gray-level co-occurrence matrix (SGCM), could separate MMs from normal moles. The BCCs and SCCs were further studied by Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. Distribution was described as a Gaussian mixture model. By this classification procedure, seven BCCs, eight SCCs, five MMs, and ten NMs were correctly classified. Three BCCs and two SCCs were unseparable.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the SSE in detecting artificial changes in mole size in patients at high risk for melanoma. METHODS: In a single-center, single-blinded cross-over study, patients who had been performing the SSE confidently for at least 1 year examined their backs after the diameter of an existing mole was increased artificially in random order by 0, 2, or 4 mm. RESULTS: The specificity of the SSE was 62% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53%-72%) (N = 103). The sensitivity of the 2 mm change was 58% (95% CI, 49%-68%) and that of the 4 mm change was 75% (95% CI, 66%-83%). SSE performance was not related to perceived risk, number of <e>moles</e>, gender, age, or frequency of self-examination. CONCLUSION: Even in our highly motivated and selected group of high-risk patients, 25% could not detect an obvious increase in the diameter of an existing nevus, whereas 38% incorrectly identified a change when none was made. The SSE is only a moderately effective tool for the detection of acute, large, changes in mole size.

9757365,"<e>Moles</e> and melanoma.The melanoma epidemic in adults is well documented, and there is now evidence that the incidence of malignant melanoma in teenagers is increasing. Risk factors for melanoma are recognizable in children and include congenital nevi, numerous common nevi, and atypical nevi. Large congenital nevi overlying the head or spine also carry risk for central nervous system involvement, which, if symptomatic, carries a grave prognosis. Laser therapy has recently been advocated for small congenital nevi but often yields only temporary improvement. Adjuvant therapy with interferon alfa-2b holds promise for patients with metastatic melanoma. Melanoma risk is also linked to sun sensitivity and childhood exposures, and sunscreen use has been promoted for prevention of skin cancer. Because many sunscreens offer protection from ultraviolet (UV) B but not UVA, spectra that may be involved in melanoma induction, pediatricians should counsel their families to practice a full program of sun protection that includes sun avoidance and protective clothing and eyeware in addition to sunscreens.",M2

9187832,"Naevogenesis: a hypothesis concerning the control of proliferation of melanocytes with special reference to the growth of intradermal naevi.The pigmentary function of epidermal melanocytes depends on the donation of melanin granules to the surrounding surface structures. This involves transfer of cytoplasm (cytocrine transfer) from melanocytes to keratocytes, a process which requires competence of the donor cells and the availability of adjacent competent recipient cells. Donor cell competence involves the extension of dendrites and recipient cell competence consists of the ability of these cells to phagocytose peripheral portions of the melanocyte cytoplasm. Since there is a highly regulated mechanism for the control of cellular size which operates by inhibiting proliferation of cells that are below a critical volume, it is proposed that the continual removal of portions of the melanocyte cytoplasm by cytocrine transfer is responsible for inhibiting growth of the epidermal melanocyte population, accounting for their relatively low population density. It is proposed that inhibition of cytocrine transfer permits the proliferation of melanocytes. Cytocrine transfer may be inhibited by loss of competence of donor or recipient cells or by their relative displacement. Displacement of melanocytes into the dermis, out of range of potential recipient keratocytes, would, according to this hypothesis, result in melanocyte proliferation leading to the generation of localized aggregations of melanocytes (melanocytomas). It is proposed that this is the origin of acquired benign pigmented <e>moles</e>.",M2
9009032,"The skin cancer workload in Australian general practice.OBJECTIVE: Skin cancer is common in Australia. It is managed in large portion within general practice, and early excision usually affords cure, therefore, it may form a much greater workload for general practitioners (GPs) than incidence figures would imply. The aim of this study was to describe the skin cancer workload in Australian general practice. METHOD: Analysis of data recorded by 495 randomly selected GPs relating to 113,468 consultations (98,796 weighted for State size), which were collected as part of a national descriptive study. Medicare and census data were used to calculate rates at which GPs were consulted for different conditions. RESULTS: Skin tumours accounted for 2,083 (1.5%) of all 145,799 problems managed in 98,796 encounters. Annual rates at which GPs were consulted were: 13/1,000 people for 'malignant' tumours of the skin; 23/1,000 for 'naevus/mole; and 13/1,000 for 'other benign' lesions. The rates of diagnoses of 'malignant skin neoplasms' increased with age to a maximum among women and men aged 65 years or more of &gt; 80/1,000 and &gt; 100/1,000, respectively. For 'naevus/mole' the rates of maximum diagnoses were 40/1,000 for women and 351/1,000 for men aged 15-24 years. There was no sex difference for the maximal rate (15/1,000) among the 45-64 age groups for 'other benign skin lesions'. The main form of management was procedural for malignant skin lesions (90% of consultations) and naevi/<e>moles</e> (50%). Referral to specialist services was most common during consultations for malignant disease (22% of consultations), in comparison to naevi/moles (15%) and other benign skin neoplasms (9%). Procedures (cryotherapy, diathermy and excision) and referrals were more common for malignant lesions and naevi/moles. CONCLUSIONS: There were important differences in age distribution for rates of management of benign and malignant skin tumours and naevi. Skin tumours usually were managed in conjunction with other problems. Most were managed procedurally. Only a minority were referred. Skin cancer represents a greater workload for Australian GPs than suggested by previous incidence reports.",M2

8813435,"Nevi and migration within the United States and Canada: a population-based cross-sectional study.A survey to ascertain factors associated with benign melanocytic nevi or <e>moles</e> was conducted among randomly-selected White adults (aged 18 to 50 years) in Washington State (United States). Participants of the telephone interview in 1990-91 were questioned about lifetime places of residence and constitutional factors. Subjects counted raised nevi on their arms at the end of the survey. Logistic regression was used to examine the risk for two or more nevi compared with no nevi. Individuals who resided in warmer areas and lower latitudes than Washington State were at higher risk of having multiple nevi. This association held for residence at birth, during childhood, adolescence, and over lifetime: an odds ratio (OR) of 2.3 (95 percent confidence interval = 1.2-4.3) for lifetime average daily maximum temperature of &gt; or = 64 degrees F compared with 58.9 degrees F, and similar ORs of 2.1 for adolescence and 1.8 for childhood. These associations remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding effects of constitutional factors and for childhood sunburns as a potential mechanism. Risk of multiple nevi was reduced for both early age at migration and longer duration of stay in Washington. These data are consistent with the importance of childhood and adolescent sun exposure in the etiology of nevi, but also suggest an effect of lifetime sun exposure.",M2
7719184,"Self screening for risk of melanoma: validity of self mole counting by patients in a single general practice.OBJECTIVE: To validate self screening by patients of high mole counts, assess the within family association of sun protection behaviour and mole counts, and estimate prevalence of risk factors for melanoma. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Systematic sample of families from a single affluent general practice population in Wessex. DESIGN: Subjects completed a questionnaire about risk factors for melanoma and counted their <e>moles</e>. Subsequently a mole count was done by a general practitioner trained at dermatology clinics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Validation of self counts by observer's count. Within family association of sun protection behaviour and mole counts; self reported risk factors. RESULTS: 199/237 subjects (84%) returned the questionnaire; 212/237 (89%) were examined. High counts by patients on the front of the trunk (&gt; 7 moles of &gt; or = 2 mm) were reasonably sensitive (79%), predictive (75%), and specific (97%) of the observer's mole counts (kappa = 0.74), unlike arm or total body counts. Sun protection behaviour correlated between individuals and other family members (Spearman's coefficient r = 0.50, P &lt; 0.01). In the past three months 15/114 adults (13.2%, 95% confidence interval 7.0% to 19.4%) reported any change in a mole and 6/114 (5.3%, 2.0% to 11.1%)  major  changes; 6/109 adults (5.5%, 2.1% to 11.6%) had both high mole counts and freckling. CONCLUSIONS: Asking patients to count trunk moles could be a feasible way of identifying patients at high risk of melanoma. Concentrating on reported major changes in moles should avoid considerable workload in general practice. The generalisability of these findings and the adverse effects, net benefit in earlier diagnosis and prevention, and workload implications of such self screening need further research.",M2

Attention has also been directed toward pinpointing which persons are at increased risk for melanoma to reduce risk where possible and to aid early diagnosis. Essentially all epidemiologic studies have identified an increased number of melanocytic nevi as an important risk factor in the development of melanoma, but controversy has arisen concerning the risk associated with certain types of nevi, particularly  dysplastic  nevi. We review melanoma risk factors and examine the relationship between melanocytic nevi and melanoma to clarify for primary care physicians what is  known  (non-controversial) and what is  unknown  (controversial).

Our aim was to investigate a large number of survivors of childhood cancer in order to test the hypothesis that they have more melanocytic naevi than matched controls. Total-body naevus counts were obtained from 263 oncology patients ascertained in paediatric oncology departments in Queensland, Australia, and from 263 hospital controls matched for age and sex. Additional information was gathered from children's parents about concurrent factors influencing naevus development such as type of complexion and history of sun exposure. Matched analyses, both crude and adjusted for possible confounding factors, revealed no significant difference in overall density of naevi among oncology patients and control subjects, according to diagnosis or to duration or type of chemotherapy. However significantly more oncology patients had atypical naevi (P &lt; 0.05) and acral naevi (P &lt; 0.0001) than controls. One patient developed a malignant melanoma 13 years after chemotherapy and radiotherapy for rhabdomyosarcoma. These findings support an association between treatment for childhood cancer and acral naevi and suggest that atypical naevi may also be associated with chemotherapy in childhood.",M2

1814138,"Melanocytes, <e>moles</e> and melanoma--a study on UV effects.To investigate the UV effect on epidermal melanocytes, 21 volunteers and 11 patients with dysplastic nevus syndrome (DNS) received UVB irradiation three times weekly during 17 days. Skin biopsies were taken before and three weeks after the last irradiation (on day 37) from exposed and covered buttock skin. The epidermal melanocyte population density was estimated in dopa-stained split skin preparations. The biopsies taken on day 37 revealed that repeated UVB irradiation induces an increase in the number of melanocytes not only in exposed but also in covered skin. This increased mitotic activity might be a link between sun exposure and melanoma development in covered skin. The size of the proliferative response was inversely correlated to the basal melanocyte number. The larger population increase in skin with few melanocytes might amplify the propagation of DNA damage and increase the likelihood of tumor development. The pigment metabolite 5-S-cysteinyldopa (5-S-CD) was measured in urine before the irradiation and twice weekly until day 38. No correlation was found between the basal 5-S-CD excretion and the size or activity of the melanocyte organ, suggesting that the basal 5-S-CD excretion is mainly of non-melanocytic origin. Despite numerous nevi, DNS-patients did not differ from controls in their 5-S-CD excretion. The normal upper range for the tumor maker 5-S-CD is therefore valid in these melanoma-prone subjects. During the irradiation, subjects with a low tanning ability developed a more pronounced erythema and excreted more 5-S-CD than those with a good tanning ability. This suggests that the UVB-induced 5-S-CD excretion is rather due to melanocyte damage than to an increased melanin synthesis. To investigate the influence of sun exposure on the development of nevi and melanoma (CMM), the distribution over the body surface of CMM, common nevi (CN) greater than or equal to 2 mm and dysplastic nevi (DN) was registered in 121 melanoma patients and 310 controls. Four times as many nevi were found in a sun-exposed area than in a comparable sun-protected area, demonstrating that sun exposure plays an important role in nevus development. Subjects with DNA had a larger difference in nevus counts between the two areas than subjects without DN, indicating a different UV-dose and/or a higher sensitivity to the  nevogenic  effect of UV-light than subjects without DN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M2

Lesions measuring 2 mm or less in diameter and those measuring more than 2 mm were recorded separately. Dysplastic nevi were also recorded separately. The attitude toward sun worship was related to the average periods of sunbathing, the frequency of holidays in sunny climates, and the use of artificial ultraviolet sources. The frequency of pigmented nevi showed no correlation with sun behavior, irrespective of sex, mole size, or burning and tanning propensities. This lack of correlation between ultraviolet exposure and mole counts held true for all solar parameters: periods of sunbathing, sunny holidays, and sunlamp usage. Contrary to expectation, there was a clear, although not statistically significant, excess of dysplastic nevi in subjects with short periods of ultraviolet exposure during leisure. From these data insufficient evidence emerges to support the hypothesis of a correlation between the occurrence of common nevocytic nevi and dysplastic nevi and the degree of insolation by natural or artificial ultraviolet radiation.",M2

Cases diagnosed during follow-up from 1976 to 1982 were included in this study. Participants reported counts of all moles and raised moles alone on postal questionnaires. Distributions of moles were similar for right and left sides on upper and lower limbs for cases and controls. Counts declined with increasing age for all women, from a median of 15 for the youngest tertile of controls (aged 36-46 years) to three for the oldest (aged 54-62 years). Cases had more moles than did controls (medians of 23 and 9, respectively, for total moles on all four limbs): The presence of any mole on a limb gave relative risks for melanoma ranging from 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-4.0) for one or more moles on an arm to 2.9 (95% CI = 1.6-5.3) for one or more moles on the lower limb. For raised moles, relative risks were 1.7 (95% CI = 1.0-2.7) for arm, 2.1 (95% CI = 1.3-3.5) for lower limb, and 3.5 (95% CI = 2.0-6.3) for leg (below knee). The highest site-specific risk (i.e., for any moles on the same limb as the melanoma vs. no moles on that limb) was for moles on the lower limb (relative risk = 5.0 (95% CI = 1.8-13.5)). There were positive and significant trends in overall and site-specific risk with increasing numbers of moles on all limbs when absolute mole counts were considered, e.g., for total moles on all four limbs combined, chi for trend = 4.0, one-sided p less than 0.001, with relative risk for more than 100 moles versus none of 6.0. Inclusion of sun exposure and other constitutional factors in logistic regression analyses did not alter these observed relations between the presence of moles and risk of melanoma.",M2

The second section deals with the indication for surgical treatment. Distinction is made between relative and absolute indications. We considered the cosmetic reason only as a relative indication for surgery. On the other hand we based the absolute indication on three reasons: a) Psychosocial aspects observed in patients with moles on the face. b) Risk of malignancy: there is a high risk of melanoma associated with congenital melanocytic naevi, dysplastic naevi and blue naevi; carcinomas can develop to a sebaceous naevus; basaliomas have been described in linear verrucous epidermal naevus (Schimmelpennig-Feuerstein-Mims Syndrome). c) Complications associated with location and/or the size of a mole: amblyopia results if a haemangioma on eyelid remains untreated. Kasabach-Merrit-Syndrome develops in children with large haemangiomas.
