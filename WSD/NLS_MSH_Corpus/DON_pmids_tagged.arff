19024426,"Assuming the mantle of leadership: issues and challenges for directors of nursing.This ethnographic study investigated leadership from the perspective of directors of nursing (<e>DONs</e>) in proprietary nursing homes. Data from interviews and extensive participant observation with 10 DONs were analyzed using open coding and content analysis. The study drew on a priori concepts from transformational leadership theory to describe the role, DON approaches to leadership, and factors that facilitate or impede leadership in nursing homes. This article reports findings from a larger study related to conditions existing when participants entered the DON position. Antecedent conditions influenced organizational expectations of incoming DONs and shaped participants' leadership experiences. DONs filling long-standing vacancies had to reestablish the influence and authority of the role. Those replacing unsuccessful DONs confronted serious regulatory, care, and morale issues. In contrast, DONs with successful predecessors experienced organizational support and had confidence in their abilities to lead.",M1
16350901,"Who will care for the caregivers?Research shows that stable leadership provided by a nursing home's director of nursing (<e>DON</e>) is the foundation of good quality. Conversely, a high DON turnover often results in a quality meltdown at all levels. A recent study, seeking to uncover the root causes of DON turnover, looked at 103 DONs working in Virginia nursing homes. Although DONs overwhelming affirmed their role and agreed that they were overall satisfied, a majority said they would not choose to be a DON again or recommend the role to others. Not surprisingly, low staff retention rates, mounting administrative responsibilities, growing regulatory and legal constraints, and unrealistic time commitments were the leading causes of frustration. Given less time to spend on the responsibilities that lie at the very heart of their mission-direct-care and clinical issues, quality improvement, family relations, staff mentoring and professional development-DONS are likely to experience burnout unless long-term care owners and managers reconfigure their role.",M1
15890300,"Barriers to providing osteoporosis care in skilled nursing facilities: perceptions of medical directors and directors of nursing.OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to identify the barriers to osteoporosis clinical practice guideline use perceived by Medical Directors (MED DIR) and Directors of Nursing (<e>DON</e>) in skilled nursing facilities; and to describe differences in the perceptions of MED DIRs and DONs. DESIGN: The authors conducted a cross-sectional national survey. PARTICIPANTS: This study consisted of a random national sample of MED DIRs (n = 1300) and DONs (n = 1300) belonging to the American Medical Directors Association or the National Association of Directors of Nursing Administration in Long-term Care. MEASUREMENTS: A 24-item survey using a five-point Likert scale was developed. The survey measured agreement to questions in four domains (provider factors, guideline characteristics, patient factors, environmental factors) and 10 content areas (problem acknowledgment, patient/family concern, patient/family compliance, testing availability, safety, reimbursement, regulatory oversight, staff knowledge/time/ability, belief in guidelines, and malpractice liability). Response distributions to each item were plotted and differences between MED DIRs and DONs were tested. RESULTS: Survey response rates were 40% for MED DIRs and 48% for DONs. Respondents strongly agreed that fractures are a problem in their facilities and that osteoporosis guidelines are useful and cost-beneficial (mean responses &gt; or = 4.0). A large proportion of respondents (at least 40% of the sample) identified multiple patient comorbidities, reimbursement issues, length of stay, and regulatory oversight as barriers to providing osteoporosis care. Respondents did not believe that patient and family acceptance, testing availability, staff time, staff self-efficacy, or concerns about bisphosphonate safety were barriers to osteoporosis care. DONs were more likely than MED DIRs to believe that patients and families are concerned about fractures, whereas MED DIRs were more likely to endorse length of stay, staffing issues, and regulatory oversight as influencing treatment decisions. Years of practice and facility size, but not formal geriatrics training, significantly influenced responses. CONCLUSION: Perceived barriers to implementing osteoporosis guidelines differ between facilities and between MED DIRs and DONs. Identification of these barriers could facilitate quality improvement initiatives and improve the quality of osteoporosis care.",M1

10765883,"Preferences for an influences on oral health prevention: perceptions of directors of nursing.Directors of Nursing (<e>DONs</e>) from 196 of 206 Nebraska long-term-care (LTC) facilities were sent a pre-tested questionnaire. The aim was to assess available on-site dental services, existing oral health education and prevention programs as well as future needs/preferences, and the influence of 10 factors in assessing and maintaining residents' oral health. Of the 196 DONs contacted, 126 (64%) participated. Only 36% of DON responders reported having on-site dental services. DONs indicated a preference for nursing staff (NS) oral health inservice training over other educational and/or programmatic proposals. When asked to select the five most influential factors in assessing and maintaining residents' oral health in their respective facilities, DONs selected resident factors (mean, 2.8) more often than NS factors (mean, 2.2). DONs most often identified residents' (R') ability to perform oral hygiene (n = 99), R' cooperation with OH assistance (n = 98), R' interest in their oral health (n = 83), NS interest in R' dental health (n = 70), and NS time constraints (n = 69).",M1

9852661,"Recruitment barriers in rural community hospitals: a comparison of nursing and nonnursing factors.Despite encouraging signs suggesting that many rural hospitals are experiencing less severe staff shortages, the challenge of successfully recruiting nurses to rural practice settings continues to be a major obstacle. Based on a 1993 survey of 164 directors of nursing (<e>DONs</e>) practicing in rural community hospitals, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to cluster 21 DON-rated recruitment barriers into factors associated with nursing delivery, local community, and professional interaction. DONs, most notably those practicing in the smallest rural facilities (&lt; or = 25 beds), reported community-related barriers such as spouse's employment as the most severe obstacles to successful registered nurse (RN) recruitment. However, upon examination conducted by using multiple regression analyses, only those factors related to nursing delivery and professional interaction were found to be statistically significant predictors of existing staff RN full-time equivalency vacancy rates. Given that barriers related to individual nursing staffs are likely to be far more amenable to change than those associated with rural environments, these findings offer encouragement to nursing administrators who are faced with the difficulties of attracting RNs to rural practice settings.",M1

20072653,"Peritoneal adhesion and angiogenesis in ovarian carcinoma are inversely regulated by hyaluronan: the role of gonadotropins.Ovarian carcinoma is the leading cause of death among gynecologic cancers. Although transformation of the outer ovarian epithelium was linked with ovulation, the disease is significantly more prevalent and severe in postmenopausal women. We postulated that menopause could augment ovarian cancer progression through the effects of gonadotropins on multifocal seeding to the mesothelial layer lining the peritoneum. This seeding is mediated by integrins as well as by CD44 interaction with hyaluronan (HA). Here, we report the effect of gonadotropins on HA synthesis and degradation and on peritoneal adhesion. A significant concentration- and time-dependent induction in expression levels of HA synthases (HASs) and hyaluronidases (Hyals) was observed in vitro on stimulation of human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells by gonadotropins. Hormonal regulation of HA-mediated adhesion was manifested in vivo as well, by fluorescence microscopy of stained MLS multicellular tumor spheroids. The number of spheroids adhered to the mesothelium of ovariectomized CD-1 nude mice 9.5 hours after intraperitoneal insertion was significantly higher than in nonovariectomized mice. Inhibition of HA synthesis by 6-diazo-5-oxo-1-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) both in spheroids and ovariectomized mice significantly reduced the number of adhered spheroids. Thus, the change in the hormonal environment during menopause assists in HA-dependent adherence of ovarian cancer spheroids onto the peritoneum. However, HA is antiangiogenic and it can significantly suppress tumor progression. Accordingly, angiogenesis of the adhered spheroids was significantly elevated in DON-treated tumors. These results can explain the selective pressure that can lead to simultaneously increased tumor expression of both HASs and Hyals.",M2
19212100,"Blockade of glutamate release from microglia attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. Despite a variety of anti-inflammatory or immunomodulation drugs including interferon-beta are effective to reduce relapse risk, most patients have progressive neurological deterioration due to axonal degeneration. Accumulation of activated microglia is a pathological hallmark of active MS lesion. Microglia can act as not only antigen-presenting cells but also effector cells to damage other cells in the central nervous system. Especially, glutamate released by activated microglia induces excito-neurotoxicity and may contribute to neurodegeneration in MS. Gap junction is a major cell-to-cell channel and is composed of paired hemichannels on coupled cells. Recent studies showed that cells release various small molecules (including ions, ATP, and amino acids) from unpaired hemichannel of gap junction that is openly exposed to the extracellular space. We have previously revealed that activated microglia produce glutamate via glutaminase and release it through hemichannels of gap junctions. Thus, in this study, we examined whether the glutaminase inhibitor and the gap junction blocker relieved experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that is an animal model of MS. Here we show that the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (CBX) and the glutaminase inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) decreased glutamate release from activated microglia and rescued neuronal death in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In EAE mice, treatment with CBX or DON also attenuated EAE clinical symptoms. Thus, blockade of glutamate release from activated microglia with CBX or DON may be an effective therapeutic strategy against neurodegeneration in MS.",M2
18838022,"Influence of hyaluronan accumulation during cumulus expansion on in vitro porcine oocyte maturation.During oocyte maturation, the cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) expand dramatically. This phenomenon, which is known as cumulus expansion, is the result of the synthesis and accumulation of hyaluronan in the extracellular space between cumulus cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), an inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis, on cumulus expansion during in vitro porcine oocyte maturation and hyaluronan accumulation within COCs. Further, this study aimed to examine the influence of hyaluronan accumulation within COCs on the rate of oocyte maturation. Cumulus expansion was observed during in vitro maturation. However, the addition of DON to the maturation medium significantly inhibited cumulus expansion. The total inhibition of hyaluronan accumulation within COCs was observed with the use of confocal microscopy. Moreover, a positive correlation between the area of cumulus expansion and the rate of oocyte maturation was observed. These results demonstrate that the hyaluronan accumulation within the COCs during oocyte maturation affects oocyte maturation. On the basis of these results, we propose that hyaluronan accumulation within the COCs during cumulus expansion is a necessary step in the porcine oocyte maturation process.",M2

18775425,"Blockade of microglial glutamate release protects against ischemic brain injury.Glutamate released by activated microglia induces excito-neurotoxicity and may contribute to neurodegeneration in numerous neurological diseases including ischemia, inflammation, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative diseases. We observed that the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (CBX) or the glutaminase inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) decreased glutamate release from activated microglia and rescued neuronal death in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In gerbils, treatment with CBX or DON also prevented the delayed death of hippocampal neurons following transient global ischemia.

18452953,"Macrophage-induced neurotoxicity is mediated by glutamate and attenuated by glutaminase inhibitors and gap junction inhibitors.We have shown previously, that the most neurotoxic factor from activated microglia is glutamate that is produced by glutaminase utilizing extracellular glutamine as a substrate. Drugs that inhibit glutaminase or gap junction through which the glutamate is released were effective in reducing neurotoxic activity of microglia. In this study, to elucidate whether or not a similar mechanism is operating in macrophages infiltrating into the central nervous system during inflammatory, demyelinating, and ischemic brain diseases, we examined the neurotoxicity induced by macrophages, in comparison with microglia in vitro. LPS- or TNF-alpha-stimulated macrophage-conditioned media induced robust neurotoxicity, which was completely inhibited by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801. Both the glutaminase inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), and the gap junction inhibitor carbenoxolone (CBX), effectively suppressed glutamate production and subsequent neurotoxicity by activated macrophages. These results revealed that macrophages produce glutamate via glutaminase from extracelluar glutamine, and release it through gap junctions. This study demonstrated that a similar machinery is operating in macrophages as well, and DON and CBX that prevent microglia-mediated neurotoxicity should be effective for preventing macrophage-mediated neurotoxicity. Thus, these drugs may be effective therapeutic reagents for inflammatory, demyelinating, and ischemic brain diseases.",M2
18317946,"Premature senescence of human endothelial cells induced by inhibition of glutaminase.Cellular senescence is now recognized as an important mechanism of tumor suppression, and the accumulation of senescent cells may contribute to the aging of various human tissues. Alterations of the cellular energy metabolism are considered key events in tumorigenesis and are also known to play an important role for aging processes in lower eukaryotic model systems. In this study, we addressed senescence-associated changes in the energy metabolism of human endothelial cells, using the HUVEC model of in vitro senescence. We observed a drastic reduction in cellular ATP levels in senescent endothelial cells. Although consumption of glucose and production of lactate significantly increased in senescent cells, no correlation was found between both metabolite conversion rates, neither in young endothelial cells nor in the senescent cells, which indicates that glycolysis is not the main energy source in HUVEC. On the other hand, glutamine consumption was increased in senescent HUVEC and inhibition of glutaminolysis by <e>DON</e>, a specific inhibitor of glutaminase, led to a significant reduction in the proliferative capacity of both early passage and late passage cells. Moreover, inhibition of glutaminase activity induced a senescent-like phenotype in young HUVEC within two passages. Together, the data indicate that glutaminolysis is an important energy source in endothelial cells and that alterations in this pathway play a role in endothelial cell senescence.",M2
17961828,"Mechanism-of-action determination of GMP synthase inhibitors and target validation in Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus.Mechanism-of-action (MOA) studies of bioactive compounds are fundamental to drug discovery. However, in vitro studies alone may not recapitulate a compound's MOA in whole cells. Here, we apply a chemogenomics approach in Candida albicans to evaluate compounds affecting purine metabolism. They include the IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors mycophenolic acid and mizoribine and the previously reported GMP synthase inhibitors acivicin and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>). We report important aspects of their whole-cell activity, including their primary target, off-target activity, and drug metabolism. Further, we describe ECC1385, an inhibitor of GMP synthase, and provide biochemical and genetic evidence supporting its MOA to be distinct from acivicin or DON. Importantly, GMP synthase activity is conditionally essential in C. albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus and is required for virulence of both pathogens, thus constituting an unexpected antifungal target.",M2
17394798,"Influence of hyaluronic acid synthesis and cumulus mucification on bovine oocyte in vitro maturation, fertilisation and embryo development.During cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) maturation, cumulus expansion involves the deposition of mucoelastic compounds, especially hyaluronic acid, synthesised from glucose via the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of uridine monophosphate (UMP) and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), inhibitors of hyaluronic acid synthesis, during bovine oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) on cumulus expansion, glucose uptake, protein synthesis, cumulus cell number, meiotic maturation, cleavage rate and subsequent embryo development. A further aim of the study was to examine the effect of hyaluronic acid on sperm capacitation and acrosome reaction in relation to the capacity of COCs to be fertilised in vitro. A low correlation between glucose uptake and degree of cumulus expansion was observed. Total and partial inhibition of cumulus expansion was observed with DON and UMP, respectively, and was accompanied by a decrease in glucose uptake with DON. Total protein content and cumulus cell number per COC increased during IVM, but was unaffected by the presence of DON or UMP, as was oocyte meiotic maturation. Rates of cleavage and blastocyst development decreased in oocytes matured with DON and UMP, although this inhibition was reversed when the in vitro fertilisation (IVF) medium contained heparin. Hyaluronic acid induced capacitation and the acrosome reaction, and in IVF medium prevented the inhibition of cleavage and blastocyst development by DON in a similar fashion to heparin. Hyaluronic acid synthesis during cumulus mucification contributes to the penetration and fertilisation of bovine oocytes, most likely by facilitating the processes of capacitation and acrosome reaction. Mucification during IVM is independent of cumulus cell proliferation, COC protein content, oocyte meiotic maturation and subsequent developmental competence once fertilised.",M2
17334904,"Which mechanisms are involved in taurine-dependent granulocytic immune response or amino- and alpha-keto acid homeostasis?We examined the effects of beta-alanine (taurine analogue and taurine transport antagonist), taurine (regarding its role in neutrophil (PMN) immunonutrition) and taurine combined either with L-NAME (inhibitor of *NO-synthase), SNAP (*NO donor), <e>DON</e> (glutamine-analogue and inhibitor of glutamine-requiring enzymes), DFMO (inhibitor of ornithine-decarboxylase) and beta-alanine on neutrophil amino- and alpha-keto acid profiles or important PMN immune functions in order to establish whether taurine transport-, nitric oxide-, glutamine- or ornithine-dependent mechanisms are involved in any of the taurine-induced effects. According to the present findings, the taurine-mediated effect appears to be based primarily on a modulation of important transmembraneous transport mechanisms and only secondarily on directly or indirectly induced modifications in intragranulocytic amino- and alpha-keto acid homoeostasis or metabolism. Although a direct relation to the parallel observed immunological modifications can only be presumed, these results show very clearly that compositional modifications in the free intragranulocytic amino- and alpha keto-acid pools coinciding with changes in intragranulocytic taurine levels are relevant metabolic determinants that can significantly influence the magnitude and quality of the granulocytic immune response.",M2
17072790,"Pathways involved in alanyl-glutamine-induced changes in neutrophil amino- and alpha-keto acid homeostasis or immunocompetence.We examined the effects of <e>DON</e> [glutamine-analogue and inhibitor of glutamine-requiring enzymes], alanyl-glutamine (regarding its role in neutrophil immunonutrition) and alanyl-glutamine combined with L-NAME, SNAP, DON, beta-alanine and DFMO on neutrophil amino and alpha-keto acid concentrations or important neutrophil immune functions in order to establish whether an inhibitor of *NO-synthase [L-NAME], an *NO donor [SNAP], an analogue of taurine and a taurine transport antagonist [beta-alanine], an inhibitor of ornithine-decarboxylase [DFMO] as well as DON could influence any of the alanyl-glutamine-induced effects. In summary, irrespective of which pharmacological, metabolism-inhibiting or receptor-mediated mechanisms were involved, our results showed that impairment of granulocytic glutamine uptake, modulation of intracellular glutamine metabolisation and/or de novo synthesis as well as a blockade of important glutamine-dependent metabolic processes may led to significant modifications of physiological and immunological functions of the affected cells.",M2
16517020,"Glutamine in the mechanism of ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling.Brain edema and the subsequent increase in intracranial pressure are the major neurological complications in fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). Brain edema in FHF is predominantly  cytotoxic  due principally to astrocyte swelling. It is generally believed that ammonia plays a key role in this process, although the mechanism by which ammonia brings about such swelling is yet to be defined. It has been postulated that glutamine accumulation in astrocytes subsequent to ammonia detoxification results in increased osmotic forces leading to cell swelling. While the hypothesis is plausible and has gained support, it has never been critically tested. In this study, we examined whether a correlation exists between cellular glutamine levels and the degree of cell swelling in cultured astrocytes exposed to ammonia. Cultured astrocytes derived from rat brain cortices were exposed to ammonia (5 mM) for different time periods and cell swelling was measured. Cultures treated with ammonia for 1-3 days showed a progressive increase in astrocyte cell volume (59-127%). Parallel treatment of astrocyte cultures with ammonia showed a significant increase in cellular glutamine content (60-80%) only at 1-4 h, a time when swelling was absent, while glutamine levels were normal at 1-3 days, a time when peak cell swelling was observed. Thus no direct correlation between cell swelling and glutamine levels was detected. Additionally, acute increase in intracellular levels of glutamine by treatment with the glutaminase inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) after ammonia exposure also did not result in swelling. On the contrary, DON treatment significantly blocked (66%) ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling at a later time point (24 h), suggesting that some process resulting from glutamine metabolism is responsible for astrocyte swelling. Additionally, ammonia-induced free radical production and induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) were significantly blocked by treatment with DON, suggesting a key role of glutamine in the ammonia-induced free radical generation and the MPT. In summary, our findings indicate a lack of direct correlation between the extent of cell swelling and cellular levels of glutamine. While glutamine may not be acting as an osmolyte, we propose that glutamine-mediated oxidative stress and/or the MPT may be responsible for the astrocyte swelling by ammonia.",M2
15743040,"Modulation of tumor induced angiogenesis in Ehrlich ascites tumor.In this study the enzyme glutaminase, purified from the ascites fluid of ovarian cancer patients, was analysed for its antiangiogenic activity. Intraperitoneal administration of this enzyme reduces the number of tumor directed capillaries in solid and ascites tumor bearing Swiss mice induced by transplantation of Ehrlich ascites cells. The enzyme has a critical role in regulating the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from tumor cell and in turn tumor growth. Glutamine analogue like 6-diazo, 5- oxo L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) is also found to be effective in regulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion from tumor cells in vitro. Treatment with enzyme reduced serum VEGF levels of the tumor induced animals.

15573403,"Differential response of glutamine in cultured neurons and astrocytes.Glutamine, a byproduct of ammonia detoxification, is found elevated in brain in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and other hyperammonemic disorders. Such elevation has been implicated in some of the deleterious effects of ammonia on the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies have shown that glutamine results in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) in cultured astrocytes. We examined whether glutamine shows similar effects in cultured neurons. Both cultured astrocytes and neurons were exposed to glutamine (6.5 mM) for 24 hr and the MPT was assessed by changes in cyclosporin A (CsA)-sensitive inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) using the potentiometric dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). Glutamine significantly dissipated the DeltaPsi(m) in astrocytes as demonstrated by a decrease in mitochondrial TMRE fluorescence, a process that was blocked by CsA. On the other hand, treatment of cultured neurons with glutamine had no effect on the DeltaPsi(m). Dissipation of the DeltaPsi(m) in astrocytes by glutamine was blocked by treatment with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>; 100 microM), suggesting that glutamine hydrolysis and the subsequent generation of ammonia, which has been shown previously to induce the MPT, might be involved in MPT induction by glutamine. These data indicate that astrocytes but not neurons are vulnerable to the toxic effects of glutamine. The selective induction of oxidative stress and the MPT by glutamine in astrocytes may partially explain the deleterious affects of glutamine on the CNS in the setting of hyperammonemia, as well as account for the predominant involvement of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of HE and other hyperammonemic conditions.",M2
14570901,"Glutamine stimulates argininosuccinate synthetase gene expression through cytosolic O-glycosylation of Sp1 in Caco-2 cells.Glutamine stimulates the expression of the argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) gene at both the level of enzyme activity and mRNA in Caco-2 cells. Searching to identify the pathway involved, we observed that (i) the stimulating effect of glutamine was totally mimicked by glucosamine addition, and (ii) its effect but not that of glucosamine was totally blocked by 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), an inhibitor of amidotransferases, suggesting that the metabolism of glutamine to glucosamine 6-phosphate was required. Moreover, run-on assays revealed that glucosamine was acting at a transcriptional level. Because three functional GC boxes were identified on the ASS gene promoter (Anderson, G. M., and Freytag, S. O. (1991) Mol. Cell Biol. 11, 1935-1943), the potential involvement of Sp1 family members was studied. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using either the Sp1 consensus sequence or an appropriate fragment of the ASS promoter sequence as a probe demonstrated that both glutamine and glucosamine increased Sp1 DNA binding. Immunoprecipitation-Western blot experiments demonstrated that both compounds increased O-glycosylation of Sp1 leading to its translocation into nucleus. Again, the effect of glutamine on Sp1 was inhibited by the addition of DON but not of glucosamine. Taken together, the results clearly demonstrate that the metabolism of glutamine through the hexosamine pathway leads to the cytosolic O-glycosylation of Sp1, which, in turn, translocates into nucleus and stimulates the ASS gene transcription. Collectively, the results constitute the first demonstration of a functional relationship between a regulating signal (glutamine), a transcription factor (Sp1), and the transcription of the ASS gene.",M2
12821151,"Role of acetyl-L-carnitine in the brain: revealed by Bioradiography.To elucidate the role of acetyl-L-carnitine in the brain, we used a novel method, 'Bioradiography,' in which the dynamic process could be followed in living slices by use of positron-emitter labeled compounds and imaging plates. We studied the incorporation of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) into rat brain slices incubated in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer solution. Under the glucose-free condition, [18F]FDG uptake rate decreased with time and plateaued within 350 min in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and the addition of 1 or 5mM acetyl-L-carnitine did not alter the [18F]FDG uptake rate. When a glutaminase inhibitor, 0.5mM 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), was added under the normal glucose condition, [18F]FDG uptake rate decreased. Acetyl-L-carnitine (1mM), which decreased [18F]FDG uptake rate, reversed this DON-induced decrease in [18F]FDG uptake rate in the cerebral cortex. These results suggest that acetyl-L-carnitine can be used for the production of releasable glutamate rather than as an energy source in the brain.",M2
12670536,"Design, synthesis, and evaluation of gluten peptide analogs as selective inhibitors of human tissue transglutaminase.Recent studies have implicated a crucial role for tissue transglutaminase (TG2) in the pathogenesis of Celiac Sprue, a disorder of the small intestine triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by dietary exposure to gluten. Proteolytically stable peptide inhibitors of human TG2 were designed containing acivicin or alternatively 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) as warheads. In biochemical and cell-based assays, the best of these inhibitors, Ac-PQP-(DON)-LPF-NH(2), was considerably more potent and selective than other TG2 inhibitors reported to date. Selective pharmacological inhibition of extracellular TG2 should be useful in exploring the mechanistic implications of TG2-catalyzed modification of dietary gluten, a phenomenon of considerable relevance in Celiac Sprue.",M2
12670530,"A molecular warhead and its target: tissue transglutaminase and Celiac Sprue.The substitution of a glutamine residue with 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) transforms an immunodominant gluten peptide into a potent inhibitor of tissue transglutaminase. DON-modified peptides could be useful for the study and therapy of celiac sprue.",M2
11353848,"Trypanosoma brucei CTP synthetase: a target for the treatment of African sleeping sickness.The drugs in clinical use against African sleeping sickness are toxic, costly, or inefficient. We show that Trypanosoma brucei, which causes this disease, has very low levels of CTP, which are due to a limited capacity for de novo synthesis and the lack of salvage pathways. The CTP synthetase inhibitors 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) and alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (acivicin) reduced the parasite CTP levels even further and inhibited trypanosome proliferation in vitro and in T. brucei-infected mice. In mammalian cells, DON mainly inhibits de novo purine biosynthesis, a pathway lacking in trypanosomes. We could rescue DON-treated human and mouse fibroblasts by the addition of the purine base hypoxanthine to the growth medium. For treatment of sleeping sickness, we propose the use of CTP synthetase inhibitors alone or in combination with appropriate nucleosides or bases.",M2
10928046,"In vitro PET evaluations in lung cancer cell lines.One purpose of the study was to explore the PET tracer 11C-L-DOPA for the discrimination between small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A further aim was to explore the potential antitumoral effects of 6-diazo-5-oxy-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) and the use of a PET proliferation marker for the evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four lung cancer and one endocrine tumour cell line (BON) were cultured as monolayer. The uptake of 5-[76Br]-bromo-2-fluoro-deoxyuridine (76Br-BFU), [11C]-L-DOPA (11C-DOPA) and [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) were evaluated. The effects of specific enzyme inhibitors affecting the DOPA metabolism were explored. The effect of DON on proliferation and uptake of 76Br-BFU were assessed. RESULTS: All cell types showed a measurable uptake of 11C-DORA, with slightly lower values in lung cancer. There were no clear differences between SCLC and NSCLC. The addition of COMT inhibitor induced a significantly increased uptake of the tracer in BON cells, but not in lung cancer cells. DON significantly reduced the proliferation in all cell lines. The 76Br-BFU uptake was reduced markedly in all cell lines during DOn treatment. CONCLUSION: 11C-DOPA failed to distinguish between SCLC and NSCLC. DON showed strong antiproliferative effects which might motivate renewed interest in this drug for clinical cancer treatment. PET with 76Br-BFU might be used for treatment evaluation.",M2
10684596,"Reactions of Pseudomonas 7A glutaminase-asparaginase with diazo analogues of glutamine and asparagine result in unexpected covalent inhibitions and suggests an unusual catalytic triad Thr-Tyr-Glu.Pseudomonas 7A glutaminase-asparaginase (PGA) catalyzes the hydrolysis of D and L isomers of glutamine and asparagine. Crystals of PGA were reacted with diazo analogues of glutamine (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine, <e>DON</e>) and asparagine (5-diazo-4-oxo-L-norvaline, DONV), which are known inhibitors of the enzyme. The derivatized crystals remained isomorphous to native PGA crystals. Their structures were refined to crystallographic R = 0.20 and R(free) = 0.24 for PGA-DON and R = 0.19 and R = 0.23 for PGA-DONV. Difference Fourier electron density maps clearly showed that both DON and DONV inactivate PGA through covalent inhibition. Continuous electron density connecting the inhibitor to both Thr20 and Tyr34 of the flexible loop was observed providing strong evidence that Thr20 is the primary catalytic nucleophile and that Tyr34 plays an important role in catalysis as well. The unexpected covalent binding observed in the PGA-DON and PGA-DONV complexes shows that a secondary reaction involving the formation of a Tyr34-inhibitor bond takes place with concomitant inactivation of PGA. The predicted covalent linkage is not seen, however, suggesting an alternative method of inhibition not yet seen for these diazo analogues. These surprising results give insight as to the role of the flexible loop Thr and Tyr in the catalytic mechanism.",M2
10533463,"A mechanism behind the antitumour effect of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>): disruption of mitochondria.6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) exerts a growth inhibitory effect selectively on the neuroendocrine tumour cell line BON and is proposed as an antitumour drug. The mechanism behind this has not yet been clarified. In the present study, transmission electron microscopy was used for the assessment of changes in cellular organelles. Furthermore, the methylthiazolyldiphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay for mitochondrial enzymatic activity, a fluorescent marker (rhodamine 123) for mitochondrial integrity and [2-(11)C]-acetyl-carnitine which is a substrate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle of mitochondria were employed. The studies were performed in parallel in BON and in a neuroblastoma cell line LAN, with the cells grown as monolayers or as multicellular aggregates. Severe morphological changes of intracellular organelles were observed in BON aggregates treated with low-doses of DON. Especially striking was the disruption of mitochondrial internal membrane structures. Other features included the swelling of endoplasmic reticulum, autophagocytosis of secretory granules and nuclear condensation (apoptosis). In LAN cells, no ultrastructural changes were seen after DON treatment. The MTT assay indicated inhibition of mitochondrial enzymatic activity in BON cells but not in LAN cells after 5 h treatment with DON. The mitochondrial damage was also demonstrated as a reduced metabolism of [2-(11)C]-acetyl-carnitine. The observations revealed mitochondrial damage by DON treatment and suggest that the mitochondria might be a primary target for the antitumour effect in neuroendocrine cells.",M2
10377266,"Induction of gadd153 mRNA by nutrient deprivation is overcome by glutamine.The growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible (gadd) genes are co-ordinately activated by a variety of genotoxic agents and/or growth-cessation signals. The regulation of gadd153 mRNA was investigated in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1) cultured in a nutrient- and serum-deprived medium. The addition of glutamine alone to LLC-PK1 cells cultured in Earl's balanced salt solution (EBSS) is sufficient to suppress gadd153 mRNA expression, and the removal of only glutamine from Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) is also sufficient to induce gadd153 mRNA expression. Consistent with these findings, the inhibition of glutamine utilization with acivicin and 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) in cells grown in a glutamine-containing medium effectively induces gadd153 expression. Glutamine can be used as an energy source in cultured mammalian cells. However, it is unlikely that deficits in cellular energy stores (ATP) are coupled to gadd153 mRNA expression, because concentrations of ATP, UTP and GTP are all elevated in EBSS-exposed cells, and the addition of alpha-oxoglutarate to cells grown in EBSS has no effect on gadd153 mRNA expression. In contrast, concentrations of CTP decline substantially in EBSS and glutamine-deprived DMEM-cultured cells. Glutamine also serves as a precursor for the synthesis of protein and DNA. The addition of glutamine to cells grown in EBSS partly restores CTP concentrations. The addition of pyrimidine ribonucleosides (cytidine and uridine) to LLC-PK1 cells also restores CTP concentrations, in a manner commensurate with their relative abilities to overcome gadd153 expression. Finally, glutamine does not completely suppress DNA damage-induced gadd153 expression, suggesting that multiple signalling pathways lead to the expression of gadd153 mRNA under conditions of nutrient deprivation and DNA damage.",M2
9252648,"Effect of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) on human carcinoid tumor cell aggregates.The induction of glutamine starvation has been suggested as a potential target for antitumoral treatment using inhibitors of amidotransferase, an enzyme which mediates the conversion of glutamate to glutamine. Using multicellular aggregates from tumor cell lines, the effect of treatment with a suggested glutamine antagonist, 6-diazo-5-axo-L-norleucine (DON), was investigated. As indicators of treatment response, three different parameters were measured: aggregate size, uptake of 14C-methionine and secretion of Chromogranin A. Of six cell types evaluated (carcinoid, glioma, neuroblastoma pancreas and bladder cancer), the largest inhibition of 14Cmethionine uptake, amounting to 60%, was found in the carcinoid cell line BON. In this cell line the maximum effect was reached already at 10 microM concentration. DON induced marked growth inhibition in the BON aggregates which lasted 3-4 weeks after which regrowth started. During this period the secretion of chromogranin and methionine uptake was also inhibited. These studies suggest that the neuroendocrine cell line BON is especially vulnerable to treatment by DON and show that strong inhibitory effects are found at concentrations lower than that achieved in patient blood in previous clinical trials.",M2
9145921,"gamma-Glutamyl hydrolase from human sarcoma HT-1080 cells: characterization and inhibition by glutamine antagonists.Elevated gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) activity as a contributing factor in mechanisms of acquired and intrinsic antifolate resistance has been reported for several cultured cell lines. Despite this, little is known about this enzyme, especially the human species. Using the human HT-1080 sarcoma line, we observed the secretion of GGH activity into media during culture (a phenomenon that could be markedly stimulated by exposure to NH4Cl) and an acidic pH optimum for in vitro catalytic activity of the enzyme. These properties are consistent with a lysosomal location for the enzyme. Unlike rodent GGH, preparations of HT-1080 enzyme (purified &lt; or = 2000-fold) displayed exopeptidase activity in cleaving successive end-terminal gamma-glutamyl groups from poly-L-gamma-glutamyl derivatives of folate, methotrexate (MTX), and para-aminobenzoic acid substrates and a marked preference for long-chain polyglutamates (Km values for glu4 versus glu1 derivatives were 17- and 15-fold lower for folate and MTX versions, respectively). Using an in vitro assay screen, several glutamine antagonists [i.e., 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), acivicin, and azaserine] were identified as human GGH inhibitors, with DON being the most potent and displaying time-dependent inhibition. In cell culture experiments, simultaneous exposure of DON (10 microM) and [3H]MTX for 24 hr resulted in modest elevations of the long-chain gamma-glutamyl derivatives of the antifolate for HT-1080 and another human sarcoma line. These compounds may serve as useful lead compounds in the development of specific GGH inhibitors for use in examining the relationship between GGH activity and antifolate action and may potentially be used in clinical combination with antifolates that require polyglutamylation for effective cellular retention.",M2
9142921,"Glutamine protects intestinal epithelial cells: role of inducible HSP70.Glutamine (Gln) protects gut mucosa against injury and promotes mucosal healing. Because the induction of heat shock proteins (HSP) protects cells under conditions of stress, we determined whether Gln conferred protection against stress in an intestinal epithelial cell line through HSP induction. Gln added to IEC-18 cells induces an increase in HSP70, a concentration-dependent effect also seen with mRNA. Two forms of injury, lethal heat (49 degrees C) and oxidant, were used, and viability was determined by 51Cr release. Gln-treated cells were significantly more resistant to injury. Treatment with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), a nonmetabolizable analog of Gln, induced HSP70 and protected cells from injury, but less than Gln. These findings suggest that the effects of Gln on HSP70 induction and cellular protection are mediated by metabolic and nonmetabolic mechanisms. To determine whether HSP induction was central to the action of Gln and DON, quercetin, which blocks HSP induction, was used. Quercetin blocked HSP70 induction and the protective effect of Gln and DON. We conclude that the protective effects of Gln in intestinal epithelial cells are in part mediated by HSP70 induction.",M2
9037373,"Antiviral effects of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucin on replication of herpes simplex virus type 1.An L-glutamine antagonist, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucin (L-<e>DON</e>), inhibits replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, poliovirus and paramyxoviruses in cultured cells. We tested the antiviral activity of L-DON against different strains of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in Vero cells. In the presence of a physiological plasma concentration of L-glutamine (0.5mM) L-Don inhibited 50% production of virus plaques at concentrations ranging from 7.9 to 16 microM. At concentrations of 40 microM L-Don inhibited infectious virus yield by 99%. The antiviral activity of L-DON decreased with increasing L-glutamine concentrations. A concentration of 5000 microM of L-Don had no significant effects on the viability of Vero cells. Transmission electron microscopical investigations showed that L-DON prevented mainly envelopment of viral nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. The immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated selective inhibition of synthesis of HSV-1 glycoproteins in L-DON treated cells. The results showed that L-DON inhibits HSV-1 replication at a late stage in the virus replication cycle, probably the cytoplasmic maturation of virions and subsequent virion egress from the cells.",M2
8649470,"DNA strand cleavage by tumor-inhibiting antibiotic 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine.A tumor-inhibiting antibiotic, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), caused DNA single-strand breaks. Thus, supercoiled plasmid DNA was transformed into an open circular relaxed form DNA by incubation with DON at pH 7.4. DNA strand cleavage by DON was not inhibited by superoxide dismutase, but inhibited by catalase. The inhibition by catalase may not be due to the destruction of hydrogen peroxide, but to the masking DON by the interaction with the heme moiety of the enzyme. DNA strand cleavage by DON was inhibited by azide, mannitol, ethanol, cysteine and 2-mercaptoethanol, suggesting the involvement of radical species in the cleavage. The cleavage, however, was not suppressed by removal of dissolved oxygen from the reaction mixture, indicating that no oxygen-derived radicals participated in the cleavage. Electron spin resonance spin-trapping technique using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) and N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) elucidated the generation of a carbon-centered radical from DON. Hence, the carbon-centered radical may participate in DNA strand cleavage by DON.",M2
7576620,"F-actin is involved in control of bovine cumulus expansion.Previously, we showed that the gonadotropin-induced expansion of bovine cumulus oophorus occurs concomitantly with the rearrangement of microfilaments (MFs) inside cumulus cell cytoplasm (Sutovský et al., 1993: Biol Reprod 49:1277-1287; Sutovský et al., 1994: Reprod Nutr Dev 34:415-425) and that cumulus expansion in cattle is accompanied by the increased expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins laminin and type IV collagen as well as of their actin-linked membrane receptors, integrin subunits alpha-6 and beta-1 (Sutovský and Motlík: 1994). The present study was undertaken to determine the spatial and temporal relationship between cytoskeletal rearrangement and ECM synthesis during cumulus expansion. Using electron microscopy and confocal (LSCM) and conventional fluorescence microscopy, we compared the expression of the above integrins and ECM proteins and the rearrangement of cytoskeleton in the gonadotropin-stimulated bovine oocyte cumulus complexes (OCCs) with those exposed to gonadotropin stimulation and to ECM synthesis inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucin (<e>DON</e>), or MF-disorganizing drug cytochalasin B (CB). In control OCCs, the 24-hr culture in the presence of follicle stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone (FSH/LH) caused the expansion of cumuli oophori and an extensive rearrangement of MFs in the cytoplasm of cumulus cells. Concomitantly, we observed an increased deposition of laminin and type IV collagen in the intercellular spaces among cumulus cells. The redistribution of microtubules (MTs), intermediate filaments (IFs), and integrin chains alpha-6 and beta-1 also occurred at this time. The addition of 20 micrograms/ml of CB prevented cumulus expansion and accumulation of laminin and type IV collagen in the OCCs. Moreover, cytochalasin treatment blocked the redistribution of MTs and IFs, and caused the disorganization of MFs and dispersion of integrins in cumulus cells. In contrast, the distribution of integrins and cytoskeletal elements was not affected when we blocked cumulus expansion and ECM protein accumulation by DON. These data suggest that F-actin acts upstream of ECM synthesis in the cascade of events leading to the expansion of bovine cumulus ooophorus.",M2
7779798,"Determination of subunit dissociation constants in native and inactivated CTP synthetase by sedimentation equilibrium.Sedimentation equilibrium was used to correlate changes in aggregation state with active site modification of Escherichia coli CTP synthetase. The native enzyme equilibrated between monomers, dimers, and tetramers in the absence of substrates. At enzyme concentrations above 5 microM, tetramers represented 40% of the species in solution. Inactivation by 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine (<e>DON</e>) or thiourea dioxide reduced the amount of tetramer to below detectable limits. However, inactivated enzyme still equilibrated between monomers and dimers. Simultaneous analysis of multispeed data at three protein concentrations yielded estimates of the dissociation constants for the monomer-dimer and dimer-tetramer equilibria. For multiple data sets of native enzyme, K1,2 was between 1 and 2 microM, and K2,4 was between 1 and 18 microM. For DON inactivated enzyme, K1,2 was 3-4 microM, and for thiourea dioxide inactivated enzyme, K1,2 was approximately 1 microM. The values for K1,2 are consistent with previously published studies by gel filtration, demonstrating that the enzyme dissociates to monomers in very dilute solution (Anderson, 1983). However, the sedimentation equilibrium experiments are the first to show that the enzyme forms tetramers in the absence of nucleotides. This result implies the presence of stable conformations in the native enzyme capable of dynamic equilibrium between monomers, dimers, and tetramers. The results presented here illustrate the sensitivity of sedimentation equilibrium for measuring the aggregation state of equilibrating enzyme species and demonstrate that active site modifications disrupt the quaternary structure of CTP synthetase.",M2
7885392,"Mutagenicity of O-diazoacetyl-L-serine (azaserine) and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L- norleucine (<e>DON</e>) in a soybean test system.The mutagenicity of O-diazoacetyl-L-serine (azaserine) and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), glutamine analogues, were assayed in heterozygous soybean plants (Y11y11), according to the appearance of mutational spots (yellow, dark green and twin) on the leaves. The mutagenicity of azaserine was detected at 0.1 mg/ml, and that of DON, at 0.05 mg/ml. DON was strongly cytotoxic at doses exceeding 0.1 mg/ml. After azaserine and DON treatment, large spots which occupied more than half the leaflet were found in the first and second compound leaves. The glutamine analogues increased the frequency of yellow spots much more than dark green spots or twin spots. Light green spots were observed on y11y11 plants. Azaserine and DON induce somatic crossing over, point mutation and segmental loss as major effects.",M2
7867599,"Endogenous glutamate involvement in pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone: evidence from effect of glutamine and developmental changes.The secretion of GnRH can be stimulated by glutamate (GLU) and GLU agonists, whereas GLU receptor antagonists inhibit GnRH. Using 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), an inhibitor of glutaminase, we aimed to study the involvement of endogenous GLU in GnRH secretion through the effects of impaired GLU biosynthesis from its precursor glutamine (GLN). GnRH secretion by hypothalamic explants of male rats, aged 15 and 50 days, was compared, because the frequency of spontaneous GnRH secretory pulses showed a 2-fold increase between those two ages. Using explants of 50-day-old rats, GLN elicited GnRH secretion in a similar dose-related manner as GLU. DON prevented GLN-evoked secretion of GnRH, whereas the effect of GLU was not altered. DON also markedly inhibited spontaneous pulsatile secretion of GnRH and the secretory response to veratridine, a Na+ channel opener. The inhibitory effect of DON on veratridine-evoked secretion of GnRH was directly related to the duration of exposure to DON and the frequency of GnRH secretory episodes. Using explants of 15-day-old rats, GLN could elicit GnRH release, although this response was lower than GLU-evoked secretion of GnRH. The DON concentrations required for inhibition of veratridine-evoked secretion of GnRH were lower at 15 days than at 50 days. These data indicate that 1) GLU biosynthesis from GLN is a prerequisite to the physiological mechanism of pulsatile GnRH secretion; and 2) inhibition of veratridine- or GLN-induced secretion of GnRH requires higher DON concentrations after the onset of puberty than before. This suggests that glutaminase, the enzyme controlling GLU biosynthesis from GLN, shows increased activity after the onset of puberty when the frequency of pulsatile GnRH secretion is increased as well.",M2
7710273,"Inhibition of replication of human respiratory syncytial virus by 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine.The effect of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (L-<e>DON</e>), a glutamine analog, on RSV replication was studied. At a concentration of 0.01 mM L-DON, 99% of RSV replication in treated CV-1 cells was inhibited. At this concentration of L-DON, the level of cellular protein synthesis was identical to untreated control cells. Trypan blue staining revealed that all the cells remained viable even at concentrations of L-DON as high as 10 mM. In addition, L-DON added as late as 24 h post infection can effectively suppress viral replication. Analysis of viral mRNA levels by Northern blot revealed that secondary transcription and subsequent steps in the virus life cycle were inhibited. Immunoprecipitation of viral proteins from drug treated or untreated cultures showed that synthesis of all viral proteins was drastically reduced by L-DON, with a slightly greater inhibition of viral glycoproteins. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining showed that drug treated cells expressed both F and N proteins and that F was inserted into the membrane as the native F protein.",M2
7910617,"Glutamate immunoreactivity in rat cerebral cortex is reversibly abolished by 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), an inhibitor of phosphate-activated glutaminase.Glutamate (Glu) immunocytochemistry has been widely used to identify presumed gluergic neurons and synapses, but several problems related to the fact that Glu is both a synaptic transmitter and a compound used for metabolic purposes are still unsolved. One of these concerns the intense perikaryal staining observed in perfusion-fixed tissue. Phosphate-activated glutaminase, a key enzyme for the synthesis of releasable glutamate, is inhibited by the diazoketone 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), which greatly reduces glutamate release. In the present experiments, DON was either injected intraparenchymally or applied epipially to the sensorimotor cortex of adult Sprague-Dawley rats at concentrations of 0.25-1 mM. Both intraparenchymal and epipial applications of the chemical abolished Glu immunoreactivity in neuron perikarya. Adjacent sections processed for cytochrome oxidase histochemistry, for aspartate immunoreactivity, or stained with thionine showed no changes. The effects of DON application are reversible, as shown in a second series of experiments in which, after 30 min of DON application, animals were allowed to survive for 5-10 days. In these cases, Glu immunoreactivity in cortical neurons was identical to that observed in normal untreated animals. The results reported here suggest that Glu immunoreactivity demonstrated by the present procedure in neuron perikarya is mainly due to Glu produced via phosphate-activated glutaminase.",M2
8181010,"The relationship between proteoglycan synthesis in Swarm chondrocytes and pathways of cellular energy and UDP-sugar metabolism.The effect of anaerobic culture conditions and various metabolic inhibitors on 35S-proteoglycan synthesis, UDP-sugar pools, and the ATP pool were investigated in confluent, primary, day 1 cultures of Swarm chondrosarcoma chondrocytes. (i) Incubation under a nitrogen atmosphere for 6 h did not affect 35S-proteoglycan synthesis or the pool size for UDP-glucuronate, other UDP-sugars, or ATP. Incubation with 5 mM sodium azide brought about a 40% reduction of proteoglycan synthesis in the first 30 min but no further change over the subsequent 90 min. UDP-Glucuronate, other UDP-sugar pools, and the ATP level were not affected by azide treatment. The results indicate that proteoglycan synthesis and its energy requirements can be supported entirely by anaerobic metabolism in these cells. (ii) 35S-Proteoglycan synthesis, UDP-sugar production, and nucleotide triphosphate pools were inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion with sodium iodoacetate. A &gt; 70% reduction of the ATP pool after 30 min treatment suggests that glycolysis is a major target for iodoacetate. Lactate production was inhibited by 40% after 3 h treatment with 10(-4) M iodoacetate. (iii) Glutamine deprivation resulted in a 60% contraction in the UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pool and markedly inhibited 35S-proteoglycan and 3H-protein synthesis. At the same time the UDP-glucose pool expanded to 200%, but the UDP-glucuronate pool was unchanged. The sum of the UDP-N-acetylhexosamine and UDP-hexose pools remained constant. Restoration of glutamine to previously depleted cultures resulted in excessive expansion of the UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pool and excessive contraction of the UDP-hexose pool before both adjusted to normal levels. The UDP-xylose pool was very small. No increases were observed during inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis induced by glutamine deprivation. (iv) 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), a glutamine analogue and amino transferase inhibitor, induced a further contraction of the UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pool and a further decrease in proteoglycan synthesis in glutamine-deprived cultures. Thus cultures use endogenous glutamine during exogenous glutamine deprivation. DON unaccountably stimulated expansion of the UDP-glucuronate pool by 180%, irrespective of whether glutamine was present or not.",M2
8119496,"Fab fragments from the monoclonal antibody ML30 bind to treated human myeloid leukemia cells.Traditionally, heat-shock proteins were believed to be located intracellularly; however, recent studies have demonstrated that under certain circumstances these proteins can be located at the cell surface. Murine ascites developed from the anti-mycobacterial hsp65 hybridoma ML30 have been shown to contain an antibody that binds to the surface of a range of stimulated myelomonocytic cell lines; however, as the purified ML30 monoclonal antibody produced in vitro did not bind to these cell lines, the results were not considered conclusive evidence of cell-surface expression of the hsp60 homologue of the mycobacterial hsp 65 on human cells. In an effort to clarify this situation, we have confirmed that the ascites derived from the ML30 hybridoma bound to the surface of human myeloid leukemia cell lines and myeloid blast cells purified from freshly diagnosed leukemic patients, but that the in vitro-derived ML30 antibody did not. In addition, we have isolated Fab fragments from the ascites derived from the ML30 hybridoma and demonstrated that these fragments bound to the surface of human myeloid leukemia cells after their treatment with the glutamine analog 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) for various times up to four days. Evidence has been presented in the literature that the ML30 monoclonal antibody recognizes a molecule corresponding to the human hsp60 homologue of the mycobacterial hsp65; therefore our results from the binding of Fab fragment preparations from ascites imply that when human myeloid leukemic cells are treated with DON, they express a human hsp60 homologue on their surface.",M2
8138012,"The role of glutamine and glucose analogues in metabolic inhibition of human myeloid leukaemia in vitro.1. Glutamine analogues L-[alpha S,5S]-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (acivicin) and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) have been shown to possess cytotoxic activity against a wide variety of animal and human xenografted solid tumours, however their potential in man has been limited by toxicity. 2. We have analysed the effects of acivicin and DON on glutamine utilization to determine whether the reason for the disappointing therapeutic profile is solely due to the inefficient inhibition of glutamine metabolism. 3. Human myeloid leukaemic cells treated with acivicin inhibited ribonucleotide biosynthesis but not energy production via glutaminolysis and had little effect on viability, whereas treatment with DON inhibited both ribonucleotide biosynthesis and glutamine oxidation and resulted in reduced viability. 4. Treatment of the myeloid leukaemic cells with the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-D-glucose in addition to DON potentiated the inhibition of de novo nucleotide biosynthesis, glutaminolysis and glycolysis, and caused a further reduction in cell viability. 5. These results provide further support for the essential role of glutamine in cellular metabolism, and indicate that use of the glutamine analogue DON in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia may be more clinically effective if used in combination with 2-deoxy-D-glucose.",M2
8106273,"Regulation by heparan sulfate and interleukin 1 alpha of the ontogenic expression of T-cell receptor, CD4, and CD8 in developing thymus.Increasing expression by T-cell precursors of the T-cell antigen receptor and of the CD4 and CD8 glycoproteins during thymus development enables specific interactions between primitive T cells and thymic epithelial cells, which initiate the development of the T-cell repertoire. Given the importance of GAGs, such as HS, in cell-cell interactions in other organs, we asked whether such molecules might participate in the cellular interactions essential for the development of the thymus. Using an organ culture model in which fetal murine thymuses explanted on gestational day 14 undergo phenotypic maturation from CD3-CD4-CD8- to CD3+CD4+/CD8+, the consequences of inhibiting GAG synthesis with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) were explored. Inhibition of GAG synthesis prevented elaboration of cortical thymocyte-associated HS, IL-1, and de novo expression of the TCR, CD4, and CD8. DON did not alter the expression of TCR or CD4/CD8 by mature thymocytes. Synthesis of IL-1 alpha, TCR, CD4, and CD8 was restored by addition of HS to the cultured organs. These findings support the concept that the ontogenic (but not the constitutive) expression of the TCR and of CD4 and CD8 depends on the synthesis in the thymus of IL-1, and that IL-1 synthesis is in turn regulated by the metabolism of GAGs. Our findings suggest that components of the thymic microenvironment, particularly HS, play a critical role in the maturation of T-cell precursors.",M2
7951513,"Differential regulation of choriocarcinoma gene expression by DNA synthesis inhibitors.We have previously shown that methotrexate (MTX) and hydroxyurea (HU) stimulate expression of the human chorionic gonadotropin alpha and placental alkaline phosphatase genes and repress the expression of the c-myc oncogene in BeWo choriocarcinoma cells. In order to determine whether c-myc downregulation played a role in the induction of these placental genes, we treated BeWo choriocarcinoma cells with aphidicolin (APH), and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), and compared the effects of these drugs with that of MTX. All of these drugs downregulate c-myc gene expression. At the doses used, both APH and DON repress c-myc expression to approximately the same extent, as well as inducing morphologic changes in BeWo similar to that of MTX, although neither stimulated hCG alpha expression. Both DON and APH stimulate placental alkaline phosphatase gene expression, but only MTX and DON stimulate cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme gene expression. This indicates that the downregulation of c-myc gene expression is insufficient to stimulate the expression of all the placental genes stimulated by MTX.",M2
8418823,"Functional significance of cumulus expansion in the mouse: roles for the preovulatory synthesis of hyaluronic acid within the cumulus mass.Gonadotropin-stimulated expansion of the mouse cumulus oocyte complex (COC) in vitro, measured with a quantitative videographic method, is comparable to that observed to occur in vivo when medium is supplemented with porcine follicle stimulating hormone (pFSH), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 2.5 mM glucosamine or optimal concentrations of glutamine and glucose. In the absence of glucosamine, the volumetric expansion of COCs in vitro is never more than 25% of that occurring in its presence. The addition of 6-diazo-5-oxo-1-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), an inhibitor of glucosamine synthesis to medium supplemented with glutamine and glucose, completely inhibits cumulus expansion in vitro. This system was utilized to examine the relationship between cumulus expansion and fertilization rates, and the maintenance of fertilizability in culture. Successful fertilization (as determined by development to the 2-cell stage) was correlated with the quantity and quality of the expanded cumulus mass, and conversely, the spontaneous loss or mechanical removal of the cumulus was correlated with a loss of fertilizability following additional incubation in culture medium. In addition, the i.p. injection of DON inhibited cumulus expansion within the intact follicle and suppressed ovulation.",M2
1359839,"The topology of the glutamine and ATP binding sites of human asparagine synthetase.Human asparagine synthetase was examined using a combination of chemical modifiers and specific monoclonal antibodies. The studies were designed to determine the topological relation between the nucleotide binding site and the glutamine binding site of the human asparagine synthetase. The purified recombinant enzyme was chemically modified at the glutamine binding site by 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), and at the ATP binding site by 8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (8-N3ATP). The effects of chemical modification with DON included a loss of glutamine-dependent reactions, but no effect on ATP binding as measured during ammonia-dependent asparagine synthesis. Similarly, modification with 8-N3ATP resulted in a loss of ammonia-dependent asparagine synthesis, but no effect on the glutaminase activity. A series of monoclonal antibodies was also examined in relation to their epitopes and the sites modified by the two covalent chemical modifiers. It was found that several antibodies were prevented from binding by specific chemical modification, and that the antibodies could be classified into groups correlating to their relative binding domains. These results are discussed in terms of relative positions of the glutamine and ATP binding sites on asparagine synthetase.",M2
1638416,"Enhancement of glutaminase-like immunoreactivity in rat brain by an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme.Changes of glutaminase immunoreactivity in rat brain were examined after intracranial injection of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), an irreversible inhibitor of glutaminase. When 1 M DON was injected into the lateral ventricle, a half-lethal dose was 7.5-10 mumol. After intraventricular injection of 2-7.5 mumol DON, glutaminase immunoreactivity was dose dependently enhanced with the maximum enhancement 3-5 days after the injection. The enhanced glutaminase immunoreactivity was recognized by enlarged granular immunodeposits in both perikarya and neuropil in many regions, such as the hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and some brain stem, cerebellar, and spinal cord regions. Intrathalamic injection of 0.2 mumol DON enhanced glutaminase immunoreactivity in many neuronal perikarya in the thalamus and in some perikarya in layer VI of the cerebral cortex. Intrastriatal injection of the same dose of DON enhanced glutaminase immunoreactivity in neuropil of the caudoputamen and in many neuronal perikarya of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei. These results suggested that DON induced a new massive synthesis of glutaminase in the affected neurons.",M2
1501246,"Transport and membrane binding of the glutamine analogue 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) in Xenopus laevis oocytes.We have examined transport and membrane binding of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON, a photoactive diazo-analogue of glutamine) and their relationships to glutamine transport in Xenopus laevis oocytes. DON uptake was stereospecific and saturable (Vmax of 0.44 pmol/oocyte.min and a Km of 0.065 mM). DON uptake was largely Na+ dependent (80% at 50 microM DON) and inhibited (greater than 75%) by glutamine and arginine (substrates of the System B0,+ transporter) at 1 mM. Glutamine and DON show mutual competitive inhibition of Na(+)-dependent transport. Preincubation of oocytes in medium containing 0.1 mM DON for 24 or 48 hr depressed the Vmax for System B0,+ transport (as measured by Na(+)-dependent glutamine uptake), this effect was highly specific (neither D-DON nor the System B0,+ substrates glutamine and D-alanine showed any independent effect) and required Na+ ions. Glutamine (1 mM in preincubation medium) protected transport from inhibition by DON. The possibility that specific inactivation of System B0,+ by DON reflects attachment of DON to the transporter was tested by examining the binding of [14C]DON to Xenopus oocyte membranes. Oocytes incubated in 100 mM NaCl in the presence of [14C]DON for up to 48 hr showed 2.4-fold higher 14C-binding to membranes than oocytes incubated in choline chloride. Na(+)-dependent DON binding (31 +/- 11 fmol/micrograms membrane protein) was suppressed by external glutamine, arginine or alanine and was largely confined to a membrane protein fraction of 48-65 kDa (as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The present studies indicate that DON and glutamine uptake in oocytes are both mediated by System B0,+ and demonstrate the DON binding to a particular membrane protein fraction is associated with inactivation of the transporter, offering the prospect of using [14C]DON as a covalent label for the transport protein in order to facilitate its isolation and subsequent biochemical characterization.",M2
1412455,"Glutamine antagonist with diet deficient in glutamine and aspartate reduce tumor growth.This study was designed to investigate whether a combination of a glutamine antagonist (<e>DON</e>) and a diet deficient in glutamate and aspartate (AG) altered glutamine metabolism in tumor tissue, and inhibited tumor growth. In experiment-1, 21 male Donryu rats were fed with AG and implanted with Yoshida's Sarcoma. Of them, 7 rats were sacrificed on the 5th day (group AG), other 7 were sacrificed next day (group AG-1) and the remaining 7 were injected with DON on the 5th day and sacrificed next day (group AG+D). The tumor weight of group AG+D was significantly lower than of group AG, or of group AG-1. In experiment-2, of 23 rats, 9 were fed with control diet and 14 were fed with AG and implanted. 12 were sacrificed on the 5th day (group C, AG), and 11 were injected with DON on the 5th day and sacrificed next day (group C+D, AG+D). The reduced ratio of tumor weight in group C+D and group AG+D were 25% and 67%, respectively. These results show that the tumor growth could be inhibited by using metabolic antagonist of glutamine, and that it had synergistic effect in conjunction with the imbalanced diet.",M2
1358530,"Effect of local hyperthermia and chemotherapy on MC29 virus-induced liver tumor transplanted into subcutis of chickens.1. A transplantable liver tumor induced by MC29 virus, whose specific utilization of glutamine in growth of the tumor had been well-demonstrated, was implanted in the subcutis of day-old chickens, and after 7-8 days, when the tumor had reached a soybean size, local hyperthermia with microwave and/or chemotherapy with 6-diazo-5-oxo-1-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), an inhibitor of glutamine metabolism, were given once a day for 7 days successively. 2. At the 7th day of experiment, the tumor growth ratio, expressed by mean +/- standard deviation was, in the tumor control group, 14.3 +/- 1.81; in DON group, 6.93 +/- 0.95; in local hyperthermia group, 3.24 +/- 2.25, and in DON+hyperthermia group, 0.61 +/- 0.57. 3. The body weight-gain ratio in the local hyperthermia group was evidently higher than that in the tumor control group. DON suppressed body weight gain most remarkably. 4. In the present transplantable tumor system, microwave local hyperthermia was more effective in tumor suppression and less hazardous to the host than our former whole-body hyperthermia.",M2
1347046,"Glutamine and glutamate metabolism in normal and heat shock conditions in Drosophila Kc cells: conditions supporting glutamine synthesis maximize heat shock polypeptide expression.We have previously reported that Drosophila Kc cells require glutamine for maximal expression of heat shock proteins in stressed conditions (Sanders and Kon: J. Cell. Physiol. 146:180-190, 1991). The mechanism of this effect has been investigated by comparing the metabolic utilization of glutamine in conditions which support hsp expression with that of glutamate in conditions where up to 100-fold less hsp is synthesized. This comparison showed that free ammonia was generated by cells incubated in the presence of glutamine in 37 degrees C (heat shock) conditions, but not at 25 degrees C, and not in the presence of glutamate in either normal or heat shock conditions. There was no difference in the amount of [14C]O2 generated from either [14C]-labeled amino acid in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, but three- to four-fold more alanine was synthesized in cells incubated in glutamine than in glutamate. Treating the cells with aminotransferase inhibitors to artificially increase NH3 release raised hsp expression in the presence of glutamate to maximal levels characteristic of glutamine. This potentiation correlated with inhibition of alanine aminotransferase. Since only NH3 production correlated with hsp expression in heat shock conditions in the presence of glutamine, and NH3 addition to glutamate also resulted in maximal hsp expression, we measured glutamine production in glutamate plus NH3 and observed net glutamine synthesis. The supposition that glutamine itself is responsible for the regulatory changes supporting maximal hsp expression was supported by the finding that the glutamine analog, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), mimicked the effects of glutamine. We conclude that glutamine imposes regulatory changes which alter nitrogen metabolism and support hsp expression in Kc cells.",M2
1290033,"Divergence in patterns of invasion among subpopulations derived from a human carcinoma clone: roles of intercellular contacts and of cell-substratum adhesion.In tumor progression, populations of cancer cells with different patterns of growth and invasion arise within the same tissue and within individual neoplasms. We tested the hypothesis that, even in histologically undifferentiated carcinomas, such diversity may be influenced by differentiation-dependent adhesive mechanisms. We used as prototypes two cell lines that originated in the same clone of a poorly differentiated cervical carcinoma, but express strikingly different phenotypes. Cells of line C-4I express select characteristics of the spinous stage of stratified squamous epithelial differentiation while cells of line C-4II resemble basal cells. C-4I cells form rapidly expanding compact tumors in vivo and multilayered cohesive colonies in culture, while C-4II cells form slow-growing infiltrating tumors in vivo and dispersed, monolayered colonies in culture. In suspension culture which prevented any cell-substratum interactions, C-4I cells formed aggregates that were significantly larger and more compact than those formed by C-4II. Thus, greater intercellular adhesion between the 'spinous' C-4I cells contributed significantly to the phenotypic divergence of the lines. Upon disruption of intercellular adhesion with the glutamine analogue 6-diazo-4-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), C-4I cultures on plastic and in suspension assumed forms resembling C-4II. On plastic, single 'basal' C-4II cells adhered more rapidly and migrated more slowly than C-4I cells, in keeping with the capacity of C-4II, but not C-4I, to secrete fibronectin (FN) substrata. However, on exogenous FN matrices, migration and cell dispersion were accelerated in both lines. Both lines expressed similar integrin profiles. Thus, the lines had diverged in extracellular matrix production, but not in the receptors for extracellular matrix components. The properties of the C-4 lines mimic those of specific cell types in normal stratified squamous epithelia, where intercellular adhesion increases but FN secretion diminishes with progression from the basal to the spinous stage of differentiation. Our results demonstrate a direct influence of differentiation-associated adhesive mechanisms on growth patterns and suggest that similar mechanisms may be responsible for variations in invasiveness among neoplastic clonal subpopulations. An awareness of these correlations may help to interpret the modes of local invasion by poorly differentiated carcinomas in terms of specific, well-defined cell properties.",M2
1703400,"Bovine pancreatic asparagine synthetase explored with substrate analogs and specific monoclonal antibodies.Several substrate analogs were tested for their ability to inhibit bovine pancreatic asparagine synthetase. Of the substrate analogs tested both 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) and 5-chloro-4-oxo-L-norvaline (CONV) were shown to inhibit the enzyme strongly. DON inhibited the glutaminase and glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetase activities and CONV inhibited the ammonia-dependent activity as well. Both of these inhibitors appeared to be relatively tight binding since desalting failed to remove the inhibition. The inactivation of bovine pancreatic asparagine synthetase by DON is accompanied by a shift from a 47,000 molecular weight monomer to a 96,000 molecular weight dimer as observed by HPLC gel filtration chromatography. This DON-induced shift is prevented by the presence of the substrate glutamine. A monoclonal antibody known to inhibit specifically the ammonia-dependent and glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetase activities but not glutaminase (monoclonal antibody 2B4) binds to both the monomer and the dimer forms of untreated enzyme, as well as to the dimer form of the DON-inactivated enzyme. On the other hand, a monoclonal antibody known to inhibit specifically the glutaminase and glutamine-dependent activities and not the ammonia-dependent asparagine synthetase (monoclonal antibody 5A6) binds to both forms of untreated enzyme but cannot bind to the DON-inactivated enzyme. These data are used to describe the relation of regions of the active site of asparagine synthetase in relation to antibody binding sites.",M2
2358467,"Cytotoxic mechanisms of glutamine antagonists in mouse L1210 leukemia.The glutamine antagonists, acivicin (NSC 163501), azaserine (NSC 742), and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) (NSC 7365), are potent inhibitors of many glutamine-dependent amidotransferases in vitro. Experiments performed with mouse L1210 leukemia growing in culture show that each antagonist has different sites of inhibition in nucleotide biosynthesis. Acivicin is a potent inhibitor of CTP and GMP synthetases and partially inhibits N-formylglycineamidine ribotide (FGAM) synthetase of purine biosynthesis. DON inhibits FGAM synthetase, CTP synthetase, and glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase. Azaserine inhibits FGAM synthetase and glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase. Large accumulations of FGAR and its di- and triphosphate derivatives were observed for all three antagonists which could interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids, providing another mechanism of cytotoxicity. Acivicin, azaserine, and DON are not potent inhibitors of carbamyl phosphate synthetase II (glutamine-hydrolyzing) and amidophosphoribosyltransferase in leukemia cells growing in culture although there are reports of such inhibitions in vitro. Blockade of de novo purine biosynthesis by these three antagonists results in a  complementary stimulation  of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis.",M2
2375279,"The role of the mesenchyme in mouse neural fold elevation. II. Patterns of hyaluronate synthesis and distribution in embryos developing in vitro.Hyaluronate (HA) distribution patterns were examined in the cranial mesenchyme underlying the mesencephalic neural folds of mouse embryos maintained in roller tube culture. Using standard image-processing techniques, the digitized images of Alcian blue-stained or 3H-glucosamine-labeled sections digested with an enzyme specific for HA, were subtracted from adjacent, undigested sections. The resultant difference picture images (DPI) accurately depicted the distribution of stained or labeled HA within the cranial mesenchyme. 3H-glucosamine-labeled HA was distributed uniformly throughout the cranial mesenchyme as 12, 18, and 24 hr of culture. By contrast, the mesenchyme was uniformly stained with Alcian blue at 12 hr, but stain intensity decreased in the central regions of the mesenchyme at 18 and 24 hr. HA distribution patterns were also examined in the cranial mesenchyme of embryos cultured in the presence of diazo-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), a glutamine analogue that inhibits glycosaminoglycan and glycoprotein synthesis. In DON-treated mesenchyme, Alcian blue staining of HA was decreased from that in controls at 12, 18, and 24 hr. However, incorporation of 3H-glucosamine into HA was increased. The distribution of labeled HA within treated mesenchyme as 12, 18, and 24 hr resembled that in controls at 12 hr. These results indicate that the distribution of HA within the cranial mesenchyme of normal mouse embryos during neural fold elevation and convergence is not determined solely by regional differences in HA synthesis. We propose that HA distribution patterns result from the expansion of the HA-rich extracellular matrix of the central mesenchyme regions. This expansion may play a major role in fold elevation. These results also suggest that DON treatment reversibly inhibits HA synthesis, since treated mesenchymal cells retain the capability of synthesizing HA when provided with a glucosamine substrate. Patterns of 3H-glucosamine incorporation by DON-treated mesenchyme are similar to those observed in control mesenchyme prior to mesenchymal expansion at 12 hr.",M2
2375278,"The role of the mesenchyme in mouse neural fold elevation. I. Patterns of mesenchymal cell distribution and proliferation in embryos developing in vitro.Using the computer-assisted method of smoothed spatial averaging, spatial and temporal patterns of cell distribution and mitotic activity were analyzed in the cranial mesenchyme underlying the mesencephalic neural folds of mouse embryos maintained in roller tube culture. Total cell density increased in central and medial mesenchymal regions after 12 hr in culture, decreased after 18 hr, and showed a further decrease after 24 hr when the neural folds of the embryos had elevated, converged, and were fusing or fused. Mitotic activity, as measured by the ratio of 3H-thymidine-labeled cells to unlabeled cells, was highest in the central mesenchyme at all culture times. Embryos were also cultured in the presence of diazo-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), which inhibits glycosaminoglycan and glycoprotein synthesis. After 24 hr in culture, neural folds of DON-treated embryos had failed to elevate. Total cell density increased in central and medial regions of the mesenchyme of DON-treated folds at 12 hr but showed no significant decrease in these regions with further culture. Mitotic activity was highest in the central mesenchyme of these treated embryos. These results suggest that cell distribution patterns observed in the cranial mesenchyme during neural fold elevation in normal cultured embryos are not produced by regional differences in mitotic activity. Rather, we propose that cell distribution patterns in the central and medial regions of the mesenchyme result from expansion of a glycosaminoglycan-rich extracellular matrix that disperses cells from these regions and decreases their density. In DON-treated embryos, in which expansion of the mesenchyme is prohibited by the decreased glycosaminoglycan and glycoprotein content of the extracellular matrix, mitotic activity apparently determines these patterns.",M2

The L-DON-sensitive step of HPIV-2 replication was considered to be relatively early. The NP, P and M proteins were, although at a low level, clearly detectable in HPIV-2-infected Vero cells treated with L-DON, whereas the HN and F proteins were scarcely detected by either immunostaining or immunoprecipitation, indicating that L-DON mainly decreased the amounts of viral glycoproteins.

2914426,"A computer graphics program for measuring two- and three-dimensional form change in developing craniofacial cartilages using finite element methods.Allometric analysis of chondrocranial growth seeks to provide objective measures of morphogenetic form change during ontogeny of the primordial skull. Linear measures, typically employed to study differential growth, become problematic at the histological level since an external referencing system is impossible to achieve for microscopic anatomies in embryos. The purpose of this paper is to describe a computer graphics program which generates spatially invariant measures of two- and three-dimensional form change using finite element methods. Anatomical form change is viewed as a continuous deformation of an initial finite element representing an anatomical unit into a second configuration. The algorithm consists of isoparametric scaling of finite elements, strain matrix formulation, and size/shape variable derivation. The routine includes four segments serving to extract nodal data, generate the strain matrix relating the two morphologies as well as deriving corresponding size/shape variables, reference the major and minor axes of form change, and provide graphic display of the anatomical geometries. Applications are provided measuring two- and three-dimensional form change in the developing craniofacial cartilages of rats subjected to treatment with the known teratogen diazo-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>). The finite element routine provides craniofacial form change variables which are expected in light of cellular alterations induced by DON administration. Finally, computational differences between this routine and similar approaches using finite element methods for analyzing biological form change are examined.",M2

The DON transport system was found to resemble that of another glutamine antimetabolite, Acivicin, in its strong temperature dependence, utilization of the  L  transport system, inhibition by glutamine but not by glutamate, potent inhibition by p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, Na+, and only minimal inhibition by various energy poisons. A Km of approximately 70 microM and a Vmax of 3.4 nmoles/10(6) cells/min was calculated for this cell line. The accumulated DON was not metabolized by P388 cells and moderate efflux occurred at 37 degrees C. The DON transport characteristics of a DON-resistant P388 cell line (100 times ID50 of parent line) were similar to those of the DON-sensitive parent line, indicating that altered drug transport may not be involved in development of resistance to this antimetabolite. The finding that an Acivicin-resistant subline of P388 cells which exhibited good transport of DON showed negligible transport of Acivicin suggests different modes of resistance towards the two glutamine antimetabolites.",M2
3342470,"Pharmacokinetic and phase I study of intravenous <e>DON</e> (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine) in children.DON (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine), a glutamine antagonist, has been subjected to limited clinical trials since 1957. Use of the drug in adults has been curtailed due to sparse reports of effectiveness as well as its dose-limiting toxicities, i.e., severe nausea, vomiting and mucositis. In earlier studies, children given DON orally in combination with 6-mercaptopurine had significant prolongation of remission of acute leukemias during maintenance therapy. As DON is acid-labile and relatively unstable in solution, oral administration does not appear to be ideal for DON. In the trial described in this report, i.v. DON therapy was studied, using i.v. chlorpromazine to control vomiting, in 20 children, 17 of whom were evaluable following treatment at DON dose levels ranging from 150 mg/m2 to 520 mg/m2. Nausea and vomiting, the dose-limiting toxicity for adults, was controlled with chlorpromazine. Mucositis, which has also been observed in adults, did not occur in the children given DON i.v. A maximum tolerated dose was not defined; however, the projected maximum tolerated dose appears to be in excess of 450 mg/m2. DON was measured in plasma using a rapid-sampling HPLC procedure. The total body clearance, plasma t1/2, and area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) were calculated using a noncompartmental method. The drug is rapidly cleared from plasma (t 1/2 = 3 h), and its volume of distribution is approximately twice that of total body water in children. These pharmacokinetic data, differ from that of adults reported by others. Specifically, the plasma t 1/2 for children is longer: total body clearance (Cl), and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) are greater. In addition, no dose dependency of t 1/2, Cl or Vss was observed in this study, and the DON pharmacokinetics were linear and predictable. Five of nine children with acute leukemia showed improvement, though insufficient for classification as partial response, and five of eight children with solid tumors also showed improvement. Further trials using DON in combination with thiopurines or other agents appear indicated.",M2

Following a 24-h incubation with 100 micrograms/ml DON (0.58 mM) or without L-glutamine, the incorporation of [35S]sulfate was maximally inhibited to about 50%, whereas the incorporation of [3H]leucine or [3H]serine and their specific activity were not significantly affected. Several lines of evidence indicate that the inhibition of [35S]sulfate incorporation was mediated by a reduction in the intracellular pool of UDP-N-acetylhexosamine: the intracellular hexosamine levels were reduced by about 50%; taking into account the changes in specific activity, the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine was also significantly inhibited; and exogenous D-glucosamine (2.3 mM) was capable of substantially reversing the inhibitory effects of DON. This decrease in endogenous sugar supply resulted in the generation of an underglycosylated, lower buoyant density proteoglycan which contained significantly fewer heparan sulfate chains of otherwise normal size and sulfation and even fewer O-linked oligosaccharides. These biochemical changes were corroborated ultrastructurally by the appearance of smaller ruthenium red-stained proteoglycans on the surface of the cells. DON also caused a marked inhibition of cell proliferation and profound morphological changes, both of which were reversible upon culturing in DON-free medium. These results demonstrate that perturbations in glutamine metabolism have profound effects on the structure of heparan sulfate proteoglycan and on the phenotype of human colon carcinoma cells and indicate that DON treatment could be useful for studying post-translational modifications of proteoglycans in various cell systems.",M2
3112139,"The effects of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine, a glutamine analogue, on the structure of the major cartilage proteoglycan synthesized by cultured chondrocytes.Incubation of embryonic chick chondrocytes with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), a glutamine analogue, led to a dose-dependent inhibition of [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycan. In the absence of exogenous L-glutamine, a maximal inhibition of 50-60% was achieved with DON concentrations greater than or equal to 1 microgram/ml (6 microM); the ED50 was approximately 0.2 microM. This inhibitory effect could be partially restored by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of either exogenous L-glutamine or M-glucosamine. The quantitative changes were due neither to inhibition of protein core synthesis nor to undersulfation of glycosaminoglycan chains. Rather, the proteoglycan synthesized in the presence of DON contained substantially fewer (approximately 50% of control) and smaller (10-15% of control, on the average) chondroitin sulfate chains as well as a paucity of keratan sulfate chains. The result of these structural changes was a proteoglycan with significantly lower molecular weight, buoyant density, and anionic charge. In spite of these modifications, the altered proteoglycan synthesized in the presence of DON was secreted normally and retained the ability to interact with exogenous hyaluronic acid and link proteins. The results of our experiments also indicate that DON substantially diminished the pool of hexosamine precursors required for glycosaminoglycan synthesis. We conclude that this decrease was responsible for the molecular alterations described above; and these, in turn, can account for the morphological changes previously seen in cartilage matrix synthesized in the presence of DON.",M2
2882437,"Effects of glutaminase inhibition on release of endogenous glutamic acid.The effects of four inhibitors of glutamine hydrolysis on synaptosomes derived from several regions of the brain were studied. The calcium-specific release of endogenous glutamic acid was determined in the presence of varying concentrations of 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM), 2-chloroadenosine (2-CA) or haloperidol. Both DON and NEM reduced the calcium-specific release in a concentration-dependent manner, equally in all regions tested. 2-Chloroadenosine also decreased release and the effect was most evident in the amygdala. As reported earlier, haloperidol blocked release of glutamic acid only in the amygdala. In synaptosomes from the amygdala, both DON and NEM failed to affect the calcium-specific release of aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine or serotonin at concentrations which reduced release of glutamate by 50%; NEM, but not DON, elevated the release of dopamine. Dopamine itself affected neither the release of glutamate nor its blockade by haloperidol even in extremely large concentrations.",M2
3788820,"Measuring histological form change with finite element methods: an application using diazo-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>)-treated rats.Analyses of drug-induced anatomical malformations routinely rely on linear measurements as a data base. Morphometric approaches utilizing these measures become inappropriate at the histological level at which a constant external referencing system is impossible to achieve. The purpose of this study was to quantify anatomical form change in the craniofacial region of late embryonic rats induced by a known teratogen, diazo-oxo-norleucine (DON), independent of any global referencing system. A sample of 17 untreated specimens of 17-day gestation served as the control. A second group, equivalent in number and age, received 2.0 mg DON on day 15. Homologous landmarks were identified in each specimen and craniofacial regions were partitioned with respect to these bounding nodes into nasal, oral, and mandibular elements. Form change was viewed as the continuous deformation of a reference craniofacial region from a 15-day untreated specimen into each final 17-day geometry. An interactive graphics program generated spatially invariant measures of form change through finite element methods. A local coordinate system was established for each element. A point within each region of the 15-day reference specimen was selected and the spatial relationship between this point and bounding nodes was quantified through interpolation functions. Size and shape variables were derived from a Lagrangian strain tensor, and values were compared between groups. Results showed that all three craniofacial regions were smaller in size among DON-treated specimens, but only oral and mandibular region shapes were different from controls. The finite element approach was considered superior to other histological morphometric techniques since an entire geometry was described and a visual description of form change as well as spatially invariant measures of size and shape change were derived.",M2
3707592,"6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine and azaserine as affinity inhibitors of glutamin(asparagin)ase.Incubation of homogeneous glutamin(asparagin)ase from Pseudomonas aurantiaca with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) and azaserine leads to an almost complete inactivation of the enzyme. The inactivation process in both cases involves the step of reversible binding of the enzyme with the inhibitor into a complex and subsequent modification of the enzyme within this complex. The data on saturation of the enzyme by low concentrations of inhibitors, the protective effect of substrate and its analogs as well as of the competitive inhibitor and product of the enzymatic reaction, L-aspartate, suggest that the modification of functional groups takes place in the enzyme active site. The presence of essential threonine hydroxyl groups in/or near the enzyme active site is surmised.",M2

The enzyme was demonstrated to be highly sensitive to the the action of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine and azaserine. L-isomers of glutamine, aspartate, glutamate and several other substrate analogues with free alpha-amino groups protected the enzyme against the inhibitory <e>DON</e> effect.

4086244,"Phase I study and clinical pharmacology of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>).The toxicity of the glutamine antagonist 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) administered as a 24 hour infusion has been evaluated. Studies of the clinical pharmacology of the drug have also been performed in 3 patients. The limiting toxicity of the drug was acute nausea, vomiting and diarrhea that was dose dependent in its severity and duration. The maximum tolerated dose was 600 mg/m2 over 24 hours. The other major toxicity was thrombocytopenia that was maximal 7-10 days after the completion of the infusion. The drug does not exhibit renal, hepatic or central nervous system toxicity. DON achieves steady state levels during these infusions and is eliminated by first order kinetics when the infusion is completed (t1/2 alpha = 1.81 h). The principal route of excretion is renal. A starting dose of 400 mg/m2 would be acceptable for Phase II studies of this drug administered on this schedule.",M2
3856328,"Isolation and characterization of a mutant Chinese hamster cell line resistant to the glutamine analog 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine.A mutant cell line, called don801, was isolated from a wild-type population of V79.5 Chinese hamster cells by its ability to grow in the presence of the glutamine analog 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), which is toxic for V79.5 cells. The don801 cells were found not to be cross-resistant to another glutamine analog, O-diazoacetyl-L-serine (azaserine, AS). It was shown that guanine but neither hypoxanthine nor adenine protected V79.5 cells from the toxic effects of DON, while hypoxanthine and adenine, but not guanine protected them against AS toxicity. Exposure of wild-type cells to DON was shown to result in a specific reduction of intracellular GTP pools, while in the mutant cells there was no effect on GTP levels. These results strongly suggested that DON was specifically inhibiting guanylate synthetase (GMP synthetase;xanthosine-5'-phosphate: L-glutamine amidoligase, EC 6.3.5.2) in V79.5 cells and that the enzyme in don801 cells was resistant to inhibition. In vitro assays of GMP synthetase activities from V79.5 and don801 cells confirmed this hypothesis. The mutant phenotype was also found to be dominant in intraspecific cell hybrids.",M2
6149445,"Discriminative effect of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase inhibitors on metabolism of leukotriene C4 in peritoneal cells.Leukotrienes are naturally-occurring metabolites of arachidonic acid that are formed via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in several tissues. Rat peritoneal cells (RPC) can produce leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4 (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4) in response to stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187 (1,2). The mechanism of enzymatic conversion of LTC4 to LTD4 is presumed to be via the action of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTPase, Figure 1) and has been demonstrated with purified enzymes from rat and porcine kidneys (3-6). We report that RPC contain gamma-GTPase-like activity that catalyzes the liberation of p-Nitroaniline (p-NA) from the chromophoric substrate gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (gamma-GpNA) in the presence of the acceptor molecules glycylglycine and L-cysteine. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under similar conditions, this preparation catalyzes the conversion of LTC4 to LTD4. Activity with gamma-GpNA is inhibited by D,L-gamma-glutamyl(o-carboxy)-phenylhydrazide (GOP) and serine-borate complex, (competitive inhibitors of kidney gamma-GTPase), and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) and o-diazo-acetyl-L-serine (AZA), (irreversible inhibitors of kidney gamma-GTPase). In contrast, conversion of both endogenously-generated or exogenous LTC4 into LTD4 by RPC is inhibited only by serine-borate complex. These results suggest that RPC contain at least two distinct forms of gamma-GTPase; one capable of recognizing gamma-GpNA and susceptible to inhibition by all four compounds, and a second form utilizing also LTC4 as substrate, and is not inhibited by high concentrations of several  classic  gamma-GTPase inhibitors.",M2
6147017,"The route of incorporation of nitrogen atom into rifamycin during its biosynthesis.In this paper, it was first shown that under various conditions of nitrogen supply the rifamycin yield was positively correlated with the mycelial specific activity of glutamine synthetase (GS), then the enhancing effect of glutamine, the product of GS, on rifamycin biosynthesis was demonstrated with resting cell system. The stimulatory effect of glutamine was more pronounced than that of glutamate, and not reduced by a GS specific inhibitor, <e>DON</e>. However, the increase in yield brought about by glutamate, and by asparagine was strongly inhibited by this inhibitor. Glutamine-CO15NH2 amd glutamate-alpha-15NH2 were synthesized and compared for the incorporation of 15N into rifamycin. It was found that the amide nitrogen was incorporated to a much greater extent than the alpha-amino nitrogen, showing that glutamine was a direct precursor of the nitrogen atom in rifamycin. In addition, synthesis of A-32 (C7N), an intermediate secreted by an inactive mutant rif 1, was also greatly stimulated by glutamine, and the synthetic C7N was found to be able to stimulate the biosynthesis of rifamycin. Based upon the above results, the route of incorporation of nitrogen atom into rifamycin is summarized as follows: (Formula: see text).",M2
6531777,"Type, location and role of glycosaminoglycans in cloned differentiated chick retinal pigmented epithelium.In clonal culture, colonies of 3-4 week old chick retinal pigmented epithelial cells exhibit Alcian Blue positive extracellular matrix (ECM) material on the surface of the cells. Alcian blue positive ECM is located between undifferentiated cells at the edges of the disc-shaped colonies and beneath the differentiated cells in the colony center. The latter material is associated with the basement membrane. The staining properties suggest that glycosaminoglycans (GAG) are present in these regions. Extraction of GAG from homogenates of colonies, followed by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate strips, results in three bands with mobilities similar to those of hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate, respectively. All three bands label with [3H]glucosamine, and the last two also label with [35S]sulfate. The composition appeared to differ when colonies were grown in different media. Digestion of the GAG preparations with various enzymes suggests that bands II and III represent heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, respectively, in colonies grown in Ham's F10g medium. The composition of band I is as yet undetermined. In minimal Eagle's medium (MEM), bands I and III consisted of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, respectively, while band II had properties suggestive of a copolymer of heparan sulfate and an unidentified GAG. Cells release only one [3H]glucosamine-labelled GAG into the medium. This material has a mobility similar to hyaluronic acid and is digested by Streptomyces hyaluronidase, suggesting that it is hyaluronic acid. Staining with Alcian Blue at different pH suggests that it may represent the material associated with the upper surface of the cells. Some of the ECM located between the undifferentiated cells and associated with the basement membrane in the differentiated regions of the colonies stains with Alcian Blue at pH 1.0 and 0.2 suggesting that it may contain GAGs found in bands I and II. Colonies treated with medium containing 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), an inhibitor of GAG synthesis, for 48 hr showed a reduced Alcian Blue staining of the ECM in the undifferentiated regions. After 72 hr of treatment with DON, the undifferentiated cells had detached from the plate, whereas the differentiated cells remained intact. The results suggest that the GAG may be involved in cellular adhesion, particularly of the undifferentiated cells.",M2
6208320,"Poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus replication in the presence of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine or 2-deoxy-D-glucose.The effects of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), 2-deoxy-D-glucose (DOG), and tunicamycin (TM) on the replication of poliovirus (PV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were examined. During a 48-hr replication period, TM, DON, and DOG inhibit VSV plaque formation in HEp-2 cells by 99.9%, 99.8%, and 99.9% respectively. Inhibition of VSV by DON is reversed with glutamine. Although all three agents are known to affect glycoprotein synthesis, DON and DOG also inhibit plaque formation of viruses devoid of structural glycoproteins. Thus, plaque formation of PV types 1 and 3 and Coxsackie B3 virus is delayed in HEp-2 and Buffalo green monkey kidney cells during exposure to these agents. Since these viruses do not contain glycoproteins and since concentrations up to 10 micrograms TM/ml cause no significant inhibition of PV, DON and DOG are affecting another viral or cellular process. Inhibition of PV replication by DON is reversed by addition of 25 mM glutamine or marginally by exposure to a combination of 5 mM concentrations of cytidine, uridine, adenosine monophosphate, and guanosine monophosphate. Inhibition of PV replication by DOG is reversed with 5 mM uridine alone. During DON exposure of HEp-2 cells infected with PV, the amount of 3H-uridine incorporation at 5.5 hr postinfection (pi) is reduced to 53% of untreated controls, an amount 11% greater than incorporation in cultures infected with PV but not treated with DON. These data indicate that the inhibition of PV replication by DON or DOG occurs at the level of viral RNA synthesis, while the primary target of these agents during VSV replication is probably glycosylation.",M2
6618009,"Use of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine to study interaction between myocardial glycoconjugate secretion and endothelial activation in the early embryonic chick heart.The glutamine analog, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), a glycoconjugate inhibitor, was used to probe the relationships between myocardial secretion of extracellular matrix and endothelial differentiation and formation of cushion mesenchyme (primordia of A V values). When DON was given to stage 12 chick embryos maintained in shell-less culture, the myocardial secretion gradient of glucose- and sulfate-labeled matrix was blocked. Concomitantly, the endothelium failed to complete activation but continued to divide and incorporate thymidine. By varying DON concentration, two distinct phases of endothelial differentiation were identified: the first (labile to 0.5 micrograms) involved hypertrophy, the second (labile to 0.25 micrograms) acquisition of migratory appendages with resultant mesenchyme formation. Glucosamine + DON (but not inosine, glucose, or glutamine) restored the matrical secretion gradient and to varying degrees both phases of endothelial activation. Endothelia totally suppressed from forming mesenchyme in situ acquired this capacity when explanted into three-dimensional collagen gel culture. The capacity was enhanced by glucosamine given in situ as an inhibitory override, dependent upon serum concentration, inhibited by heat-inactivated serum or by adding DON to the medium, but unaffected by hyaluronate. These results were compared to those obtained by co-culturing endothelium and myocardium and discussed in terms of the hypothesis that cushion mesenchyme formation results from an epithelial interaction mediated by glycoconjugates.",M2
6617769,"Biosynthesis of proteoglycans in organ cultures of developing kidney mesenchyme.The biosynthesis of proteoglycans was studied in organ cultures of differentiating metanephric mesenchymes. When triggered by a contact-mediated inductive interaction, this tissue undergoes transition from a mesenchyme to an epithelium. In the present study, proteoglycans were extracted by guanidinium hydrochloride in the presence of protease inhibitors. We found that, as a response to induction, the differentiating mesenchyme begins to synthesize large size proteoglycans with an apparent molecular weight (MW) of 1 X 10(6) D. The major glycosaminoglycans detected were chondroitin sulfates. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans were also detected, constituting 20% of the proteoglycans. An inhibitor of glucosamine synthesis, 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) was found to inhibit glycosaminoglycan synthesis by approx. 60%, and the size of the proteoglycans was also diminished. Our studies suggest that the transition of the mesenchyme to epithelium is associated with initiation of synthesis of large size proteoglycans.",M2
6879460,"Morphogenesis of median facial clefts in mice treated with diazo-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>).The morphogenesis of median facial clefts induced in mice by treatment with diazo-oxo-norleucine (DON) was studied. Following maternal treatment with 0.4 mg/kg DON on the 11th gestational day, 23.1% of fetuses recovered at the 18th day exhibited median facial clefts, which were characterized by a separation in the midline of normal midfacial components, i.e., the premaxilla, nasal bones, and nasal capsule. Malformed embryos could first be identified grossly 24 hr after DON administration by the presence of an abnormally wide separation between the two narrowed medial nasal processes. Evidence of cellular degeneration was observed in the mesenchyme of the nasal processes of DON-treated embryos 8 and 12 hr after treatment, but little or no pyknotic debris remained at 24 hr post-injection. Loss of cells due to cell death was reflected in decreased cell density observed in all areas of facial mesenchyme examined 24 hr after DON administration. It is suggested that DON-induced median facial clefts may be caused by a reduction in tissue volume, particularly in the midline, or by an interference with normal facial growth resulting in increased facial width and consequent failure of merging of the medial nasal processes.",M2

Elevation of PRPP pool size following administration of L-[alpha S,5S]-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isopazoleacetic acid (NSC-163501) (AT-125) was maximal at 8 hr and returned to pretreatment levels by 24 hr. In P388 leukemia, dose for dose, at 4 hr, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (NSC-7365) (<e>DON</e>) was the most potent of the L-glutamine antagonists in elevating basal PRPP pool size (50% above control) followed by AT-125 and azaserine, 300 and 100% above control respectively. Moreover, such augmentation in PRPP pool size preferentially affected P388 tumor rather than the small intestine. Following i.p. administration of LD10 doses of AT-125, DON and azaserine, the specific activities of PRPP anabolizing and catabolizing enzymes were determined. A significant inhibition of PRPP amidotransferase was demonstrated with DON and AT-125 (P less than 0.05), and no inhibition with azaserine. A similar modulation of PRPP pool size demonstrated in vivo following administration of 250 mg/kg of ART-125 in mice bearing colonic adenocarcinoma lines. It was suggested that a significant increase of PRPP pool size might cause the possible synergism of a selected L-glutamine antagonist and 5-fluorouracil as reported after the appropriately scheduled administration of methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil.",M2

In the present study we have studied the effect of DON on the formation of the extracellular matrix by using light microscopic autoradiography and transmission electron microscopy. The inhibition of odontoblast differentiation was accompanied by alterations in the extracellular matrix at the epithelio-mesenchymal interface. The interface was reduced in space and filled with filamentous material, and the organization of collagen fibers in more advanced tooth germs was disturbed. DON also reduced the incorporation of [35S]sulphate into the basement membrane region, whereas no marked change was observed in the incorporation of [3H]fucose.

The concentration of DON ranged from 5-100 microgram/ml; the lowest dose at which consistent results were obtained was 75 microgram/ml. At the end of a 4-day culture period, controls displayed characteristic incisiform or molariform morphologies and possessed odontoblasts and preameloblasts. The growth and development of DON-treated germs, however, was arrested and such germs remained morphologically and histologically similar to the developmental state attained at the time of explantation. DON-treated germs also contained less abundant Alcian blue staining material than controls. Development arrest by DON was prevented by addition of glutamine but not by glucosamine or the purine analog amino imidazol carboximine.

Within the bundles, the tubules were oriented either randomly or parallel to one another. They measured 25 to 35 nm in diameter with angular or circular profiles and were as long as 1 to 2 micron. In the center of each tubule, a small tubule-like component was evident that measured 5 to 7 nm in diameter. With the exception of endoplasmic reticulum, often with attached ribosomes, organelles were excluded from the bundles. Since the tubules and the endoplasmic reticulum occasionally were observed to be continuous, it is suggested that the tubules may originate from this organelle.",M2

Twenty-six evaluable patients received 31 courses of the drug. Doses ranged from 100 to 500 mg/m2. Nausea with vomiting was the dose-limiting toxic effect, transient thrombocytopenia was seen frequently, and mucositis occurred in 39% of the patients. No definite therapeutic responses were observed in 18 patients with measurable lesions. The recommended dose for phase II studies is 200-300 mg/m2 iv twice weekly.",M2

7192426,"The rediscovery of <e>DON</e> (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine).DON (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine) and azotomycin are glutamine antagonists that were tested in human malignancies in the 1950s. Azotomycin demonstrated significant activity in colorectal cancer. DON is probably the active form of azotomycin. Recent impressive results for both of these agents in human tumor xenografts (especially the CX-2 colon tumor) have stimulated renewed clinical interest in DON, the more readily available agent. DON mechanism of action, clinical pharmacology, previous clinical data, and current phase I studies are discussed.",M2
6256247,"The control of adrenocortical cytodifferentiation by extracellular matrix.Adult rat adrenal cortical cells maintained in medium supplemented with horse serum (HS) from cohesive epithelial islands secrete large amounts of corticosterone. Such cells do not produce detectable extracellular material (ECM) and are not motile. Cultures exposed to fetal calf serum supplements (FCS) produce metachromatic ECM, modulate to a fibroblastic morphology, and become motile. Within 24 h, steroid production by these cells drop 100-fold. Cells now resemble myofibroblastic  stem  cells of the adrenal cortical capsule, and express structural and functional bimorphism by exhibiting a myofibroblastic phenotype while retaining responsiveness to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and limited corticosteroid secreting capacity. Exposure of the myofibroblastic cells to ACTH in FCS overrides the effect of FSC: ECM disappears, steroid production increases several fold, and cells develop an epithelial morphology. The possibility that ECM produced in response to FCS may be responsible for the alteration from a highly differentiated, non-motile adrenocortical cell to a less differentiated, motile adrenocortical stem cell was investigated by inhibition studies using 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-nor-leucine (<e>DON</e>) and by exogenously added components of ECM. DON, a glutamine analogue, inhibited the synthesis of metachromatic ECM in FCS, and prevented the modulation to a fibroblastic morphology, onset of motility, and decrease in steroid production. Addition of hyaluronic acid, but not of chondroitin sulfate, to the epithelioid secretory cells promoted a drop in steroid production and slight alteration in morphology and movement. Both results are consistent with the possibility that metachromatic ECM production is responsible for the reversion of the steroid secretory to the myofibroblastic phenotype. This effect was mimicked by maintaining cells on polystyrene surfaces that were sulfonated to a negative charge density similar to that of ECM. This result implies that the negative charge of ECM may contribute to the expression of the adrenocortical stem cell phenotype, and that its effect is extracellular. A possible physiologic role for ECM-mediated control of adrenal cortical differentiation is proposed.",M2

Both drugs displayed remarkable activity against the murine leukemia L1210 and P388, the Colon Tumors C26 and C38 and the CD8F1 mammary tumor. No significant activity was observed against Lewis lung carcinoma, B16 carcinoma, B16 melanoma, and intracranial ependymoblastoma. DON and azotomycin also exhibited striking inhibitory effects on the growth of s.c. human tumor (MX-1 mammary, LX-1 lung and CX-1 and CX-2 colon) xenografts in athymic mice. With the exception of one colon xenograft (CX-1), all tumor lines were markedly responsive to both drugs. Tumor regressions below the initial tumor sizes of 100 to 300 mg, albeit temporary, were brought about by one course of treatment every 4 days for 3 doses (at optimal dose) with either drug. Although these drugs have been tested previously in the clinic and have shown only limited therapeutic effectiveness, they seem to worthy of a second and closer look in light of the recent laboratory results.",M2
515963,"Selective inhibition of mandibular growth and induction of cleft palate by diazo-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>) in the rat.A high percentage of cleft palates can be induced in rat fetuses by a single injection of the glutamine analog diazo-oxo-norleucine (DON) on day 15 of gestation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of DON in vivo on craniofacial growth and spatial relations in order to identify factors that may contribute to the palatal defects. Sprague-Dawley rats in the experimental groups were given a single IP injection of 2.0 mg DON (6 mg/kg maternal body weight) on day 15 and were killed on day 16 or 17. Control fetuses were collected on days 15, 16 and 17. Fetal heads were fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in Paraplast and serially-sectioned. Midsagittal and coronal sections were projected at 30 X and a series of linear and angular measurements were made. DON had limited effect on growth of the cranial base, nasomaxillary complex, and palatine processes, but dramatically reduced the length of Meckel's cartilage. Treatment with DON delayed shelf elevation approximately 24 hours, and tongue position remained high in the oronasal cavity. Growth retardation in Meckel's cartilage therefore may contribute to delayed shelf movement by retarding downward and forward positioning of the tongue-mandibular complex.",M2

All three drugs are analogs of L-glutamine and contain a diazo group. They have been studied as single agents in a wide variety of human malignancies and have also been included in trials using combination chemotherapy. Most of these studies were performed early in the history of clinical trials and, therefore, the method of reporting results and the evaluation criteria were quite different from those in use today. A renewed interest in these agents has been triggered by the remarkable activity of DON and azotomycin against human tumor lines implanted into nude mice. On the basis of this activity and the clinical data we have compiled, we feel that new clinical trials with these agents are warranted.",M2
468901,"DNA damage and repair induced by diazoacetyl derivatives of amino acids with different mechanism of cytotoxicity. Correlations with mutagenicity and carcinogenicity.Eight synthetic N-diazoacetyl amino acids, prepared by inserting a diazoacetyl group onto the alpha-nitrogen of a natural amino acid, and two natural diazoazetyl amino acids, azaserine (9-diazoacetyl-L-serine) and <e>DON</e> (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine), have been studied by autoradiography for their capacity to induce DNA repair synthesis in mouse cells cultivated  in vitro . Dose-dependent unscheduled DNA synthesis was present in cells treated with the eight N-diazoacetyl derivatives, and was absent in cells exposed to approximately equitoxic concentrations of azaserine and DON. Azaserine and DON, unlike N-diazoacetyl derivatives, did not alkylate gamma-(4-nitrobenzyl) pyridine at an appreciable extent. When DNA damage (single stranded breaks or weak points in alkali) was measured by the sensitive technique of alkaline elution, DGA was found about 4 times as potent as azaserine and about 12 times as DON on a molar basis, but about 800 and 17,000 times as potent as azaserine and DON respectively by extrapolating to equitoxic concentrations. Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity seem to follow mainly the capability of inducing DNA damage.",M2
458364,"Inhibition of tooth germ differentiation in vitro by diazo-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>).Molar tooth germs from mouse embryos were studied in a Trowell-type organ culture. After 5 days of culture the odontoblasts had secreted predentine and the ameloblasts had differentiated. When cultured in the presence of 10-50 micro M diazo-oxo-norleucine (DON), which is a glutamine analogue, the differentiation of odontoblasts was inhibited, but the teeth looked otherwise healthy. When DON was added after 2 days of culture in control medium (at this time the odontoblasts in the cuspal area were already differentiated), it did not inhibit predentine secretion, ameloblast differentiation, nor enamel secretion. However, this was seen only in the cuspal area and the boundary to the undifferentiated, more cervical cells was distinct. The results support the concept that the mechanism of the differentiation of odontoblasts is different from that of the ameloblasts. We have shown earlier that a close association between the basement membrane and the mesenchymal cells is required for odontoblast differentiation. Because DON interferes with glycosaminoglycan and glycoprotein synthesis we suggest that DON inhibits odontoblast differentiation by affecting the mesenchymal cell surface and/or the basement membrane.",M2

218477,"Formation of concentric saccules in murine parietal cells after injection of diazo-oxo-norleucine.After treatment with various chemical and physical agents, flattened or ring-like saccules may occur in the cytoplasm of parietal cells of the gastric glands of several species of mammals. In the current investigation, similar structures appeared after treatment with high dosages of diazo-oxo-norleucine (<e>DON</e>), a glutamine antagonist. A tentative sequence for their formation is suggested. Saccules formed of unit membrane became abundant in some parietal cells of the treated mice. Single saccules often had narrow lumens and peripheral distensions. The saccules, either singular or several stacked together, became progressively more curved, enclosing a region of cytoplasm that often contained glycogen-like particles and occasionally vesicles or other organelles. Many of the concentric saccules were close to an intracellular canaliculus. Membrane bound cytoplasm containing glycogen-like particles occasionally occurred in the canaliculi, suggesting that exocytosis had occurred. Cytochemistry revealed that glycoproteins were associated with the concentric saccules, probably located on the luminal surface. The glycogen-like particles in all locations stained in a manner characteristic of glycogen. It is suggested that the concentric saccules may form from vesicles of the tubulovesicular system.",M2

Sulfated glycosaminoglycan synthesis (primarily chondroitin-6-sulfate and heparan sulfate) was not significantly reduced until after cushion cell formation, an event accompanied by their altered migratory behavior. Results thus support a causal relationship between the morphogenesis of cushion tissue and extracellular glycosaminoglycans.",M2
