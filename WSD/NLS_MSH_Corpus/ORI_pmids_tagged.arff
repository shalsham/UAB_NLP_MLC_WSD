20029091,"Investigations of pi initiator protein-mediated interaction between replication origins alpha and gamma of the plasmid R6K.A typical plasmid replicon of Escherichia coli, such as <e>ori</e> gamma of R6K, contains tandem iterons (iterated initiator protein binding sites), an AT-rich region that melts upon initiator-iteron interaction, two binding sites for the bacterial initiator protein DnaA, and a binding site for the DNA-bending protein IHF. R6K also contains two structurally atypical origins called alpha and beta that are located on either side of gamma and contain a single and a half-iteron, respectively. Individually, these sites do not bind to initiator protein pi but access it by DNA looping-mediated interaction with the seven pi-bound gamma iterons. The pi protein exists in 2 interconvertible forms: inert dimers and active monomers. Initiator dimers generally function as negative regulators of replication by promoting iteron pairing ( handcuffing ) between pairs of replicons that turn off both origins. Contrary to this existing paradigm, here we show that both the dimeric and the monomeric pi are necessary for ori alpha-driven plasmid maintenance. Furthermore, efficient looping interaction between alpha and gamma or between 2 gamma iterons in vitro also required both forms of pi. Why does alpha-gamma iteron pairing promote alpha activation rather than repression? We show that a weak, transitory alpha-gamma interaction at the iteron pairs was essential for alpha-driven plasmid maintenance. Swapping the alpha iteron with one of gamma without changing the original sequence context that caused enhanced looping in vitro caused a significant inhibition of alpha-mediated plasmid maintenance. Therefore, the affinity of alpha iteron for pi-bound gamma and not the sequence context determined whether the origin was activated or repressed.",M1
20018882,"Replication initiation at a distance: determination of the cis- and trans-acting elements of replication origin alpha of plasmid R6K.Plasmid R6K, which contains 3 replication origins called alpha, gamma, and beta, is a favorable system to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) of action at a distance, i.e. replication initiation at a considerable distance from the primary initiator protein binding sites (iterons). The centrally located gamma origin contains 7 iterons that bind to the plasmid-encoded initiator protein, pi. <e>Ori</e> alpha, located at a distance of approximately 4 kb from gamma, contains a single iteron that does not directly bind to pi but is believed to access the protein by pi-mediated alpha-gamma iteron-iteron interaction that loops out the intervening approximately 3.7 kb of DNA. Although the cis-acting components and the trans-acting proteins required for ori gamma function have been analyzed in detail, such information was lacking for ori alpha. Here, we have identified both the sequence elements located at alpha and those at gamma, that together promoted alpha activity. The data support the conclusion that besides the single iteron, a neighboring DNA primase recognition element called G site is essential for alpha-directed plasmid maintenance. Sequences preceding the iteron and immediately following the G site, although not absolutely necessary, appear to play a role in efficient plasmid maintenance. In addition, while both dnaA1 and dnaA2 boxes that bind to DnaA protein and are located at gamma were essential for alpha activity, only dnaA2 was required for initiation at gamma. Mutations in the AT-rich region of gamma also abolished alpha function. These results are consistent with the interpretation that a protein-DNA complex consisting of pi and DnaA forms at gamma and activates alpha at a distance by DNA looping.",M1
19936737,"Evidence for the in vivo expression of a distant downstream gene under the control of ColE1 replication origin.ColE1-like plasmids are widely used as expression vectors and as gene delivery vehicles. We have recently described a naturally occurring plasmid deletion phenomenon in the ColE1-type plasmid, pCI-neo, which leads to the detectable expression of an apparently promotorless kanamycin resistance gene. In the current work, we found that the expression of that aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (aph) gene is regulated by an RNAII preprimer promoter located within the plasmid ColE1 replication origin, as a consequence of the extension of the RNA II species for at least 1.5 kb, up to the aph gene. This mechanism is dependent on the nonformation and/or dissociation of the hybrid between plasmid DNA and RNA II preprimer transcript. This is the first in vivo description of RNA II transcription beyond <e>ori</e> in wild-type Escherichia coli strains and nonmutated RNAII plasmid sequences resulting in productive transcription of distant downstream genes. Our results raise questions about unwanted expression of genes from expression or cloning vectors of ColE1 type and highlight the importance of a more careful design of ColE1-derived plasmid vectors.",M1
19815620,"Impaired replication dynamics at the FRA3B common fragile site.Chromosomal common fragile sites (CFSs) are genetically unstable regions of the genome that are induced by conditions that impair DNA replication. In this report, we show that treatment with the DNA polymerase inhibitor, aphidicolin (APH), slows the replication rate throughout S phase. To investigate the unusual sensitivity of CFSs to APH-induced replication stress, we examined replication dynamics within a 50 kb region of the most frequently expressed CFS, FRA3B. We mapped four origins of replication, <e>ori</e> 1-4, using two independent methods. In untreated cells, we detected significantly less newly replicated DNA at FRA3B ori 1-3, as compared with three control origins located within non-fragile regions (NCFSs). In APH-treated cells, all FRA3B and control origins tested were active; however, there was a significant increase of nascent strand DNA at the control origins and, to a lesser extent, at the FRA3B ori 1-3. On the basis of these observations and the theoretical modeling of the nascent strand abundance assay developed in this study, we hypothesize that CFS origins may be less efficient, and that APH treatment slows replication fork movement near these origins to a greater extent, resulting in impaired DNA replication and, ultimately, leading to the genetic instability characteristic of CFSs.",M1
19763421,"Cloning and molecular characterization of a novel rolling-circle replicating plasmid, pK1S-1, from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki K1.Bacillus thuringiensis, an entomopathogenic bacterium belonging to the B. cereus group, harbors numerous extra-chromosomal DNA molecules whose sizes range from 2 to 250 kb. In this study, we used a plasmid capture system (PCS) to clone three small plasmids from B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki Kl which were not found in B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD-1, and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pKlS-1 (5.5 kb). Of the six putative open reading frames (ORF2-ORF7) in pKlS-1, ORF2 (MobKl) showed approximately 90% aa identity with the Mob-proteins of pGI2 and pTX14-2, which are rolling circle replicating group VII (RCR group VII) plasmids from B. thuringiensis. In addition, a putative origin of transfer (oriT) showed 95.8% identity with those of pGI2 and pTX14-2. ORF3 (RepK1) showed relatively low aa identity (17.8-25.2%) with the Rep protein coded by RCR plasmids, however. The putative double-strand origin of replication (dso) and single-strand origin of replication (sso) of pKlS-1 exhibited approximately 70% and 64% identities with those of pGI2 and pTX14-2. ORF6 and 7 showed greater than 50% similarities with alkaline serine protease, which belongs to the subtilase family. The other 2 ORFs were identified as hypothetical proteins. To determine the replicon of pKlS-1, seven subclones were contructed in the B. thuringiensis <e>ori</e>-negative pHTIK vector and were electroporated into a plasmid cured B. thuringiensis strain. The 1.6 kb region that included the putative ORF3 (ReplK), dso and ORF4, exhibited replication ability. These findings identified pKlS-1 as a new RCR group VII plasmid, and determined its replication region.",M1
19463783,"The impact of nucleosome positioning on the organization of replication origins in eukaryotes.The distribution of DNA replication origins (<e>ORIs</e>) on eukaryotic chromosomes is nonrandom, but the reasons behind this are not well understood. Previous studies have suggested a prominent role of transcriptional activity in determining the ORI organization. Here, we identify nucleosome occupancy as a likely candidate to set up ORI distribution. Combining genome-wide data on nucleosome positioning and ORI organization in yeast and humans, we demonstrate that open chromatin domains, characterized by nucleosome depletion, are preferentially permissive for replication. However, contrary to priori claims, the impact of transcriptional activity is considerably weaker than previously proposed and could partly be explained by our nucleosome exclusion model. We propose that the ORI organization imposed by nucleosome positioning is phylogenetically widespread in eukaryotes.",M1
19458011,"Upstream regulatory region alterations found in human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) isolates from cervical carcinomas increase transcription, <e>ori</e> function, and HPV immortalization capacity in culture.Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNAs isolated from cervical and head and neck carcinomas frequently contain nucleotide sequence alterations in the viral upstream regulatory region (URR). Our study has addressed the role such sequence changes may play in the efficiency of establishing HPV persistence and altered keratinocyte growth. Genomic mapping of integrated HPV type 16 (HPV-16) genomes from 32 cervical cancers revealed that the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes, as well as the L1 region/URR, were intact in all of them. The URR sequences from integrated and unintegrated viral DNA were found to harbor distinct sets of nucleotide substitutions. A subset of the altered URRs increased the potential of HPV-16 to establish persistent, cell growth-altering viral-genome replication in the cell. This aggressive phenotype in culture was not solely due to increased viral early gene transcription, but also to augmented initial amplification of the viral genome. As revealed in a novel ori-dependent HPV-16 plasmid amplification assay, the altered motifs that led to increased viral transcription from the intact genome also greatly augmented HPV-16 ori function. The nucleotide sequence changes correlate with those previously described in the distinct geographical North American type 1 and Asian-American variants that are associated with more aggressive disease in epidemiologic studies and encompass, but are not limited to, alterations in previously characterized sites for the negative regulatory protein YY1. Our results thus provide evidence that nucleotide alterations in HPV regulatory sequences could serve as potential prognostic markers of HPV-associated carcinogenesis.",M1
19360092,"Transcription initiation activity sets replication origin efficiency in mammalian cells.Genomic mapping of DNA replication origins (<e>ORIs</e>) in mammals provides a powerful means for understanding the regulatory complexity of our genome. Here we combine a genome-wide approach to identify preferential sites of DNA replication initiation at 0.4% of the mouse genome with detailed molecular analysis at distinct classes of ORIs according to their location relative to the genes. Our study reveals that 85% of the replication initiation sites in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are associated with transcriptional units. Nearly half of the identified ORIs map at promoter regions and, interestingly, ORI density strongly correlates with promoter density, reflecting the coordinated organisation of replication and transcription in the mouse genome. Detailed analysis of ORI activity showed that CpG island promoter-ORIs are the most efficient ORIs in ES cells and both ORI specification and firing efficiency are maintained across cell types. Remarkably, the distribution of replication initiation sites at promoter-ORIs exactly parallels that of transcription start sites (TSS), suggesting a co-evolution of the regulatory regions driving replication and transcription. Moreover, we found that promoter-ORIs are significantly enriched in CAGE tags derived from early embryos relative to all promoters. This association implies that transcription initiation early in development sets the probability of ORI activation, unveiling a new hallmark in ORI efficiency regulation in mammalian cells.",M1
19332823,"Comparative analysis of Caulobacter chromosome replication origins.Caulobacter crescentus (CB15) initiates chromosome replication only in stalked cells and not in swarmers. To better understand this dimorphic control of chromosome replication, we isolated replication origins (<e>oris</e>) from freshwater Caulobacter (FWC) and marine Caulobacter (MCS) species. Previous studies implicated integration host factor (IHF) and CcrM DNA methylation sites in replication control. However, ori IHF and CcrM sites identified in the model FWC CB15 were only conserved among closely related FWCs. DnaA boxes and CtrA binding sites are established CB15 ori components. CtrA is a two-component regulator that blocks chromosome replication selectively in CB15 swarmers. DnaA boxes and CtrA sites were found in five FWC and three MCS oris. Usually, a DnaA box and a CtrA site were paired, suggesting that CtrA binding regulates DnaA activity. We tested this hypothesis by site-directed mutagenesis of an MCS10 ori which contains only one CtrA binding site overlapping a critical DnaA box. This overlapping site is unique in the whole MCS10 genome. Selective DnaA box mutations decreased replication, while selective CtrA binding site mutations increased replication of MCS10 ori plasmids. Therefore, both FWC and MCS oris use CtrA to repress replication. Despite this similarity, phylogenetic analysis unexpectedly shows that CtrA usage evolved separately among these Caulobacter oris. We discuss consensus oris and convergent ori evolution in differentiating bacteria.",M1
19219620,"Intrinsically bent DNA sites in the Drosophila melanogaster third chromosome amplified domain.Bent DNA sites promote the curvature of DNA in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic chromosomes. Here, we investigate the localization and structure of intrinsically bent DNA sites in the extensively characterized Drosophila melanogaster third chromosome DAFC-66D segment (Drosophila amplicon in the follicle cells). This region contains the amplification control element ACE3, which is a replication enhancer that acts in cis to activate the major replication origin <e>ori</e>-beta. Through both electrophoretic and in silico analysis, we have identified three major bent DNA sites in DAFC-66D. The bent DNA site (b1) is localized in the ACE3 element, whereas the other two bent DNA sites (b2 and b3) are localized in the ori-beta region. Four additional bent DNA sites were identified in the intron of the S18 gene and near the TATA box of the S15, S19, and S16 genes. The identification of DNA bent sites in genomic regions previously characterized as functionally relevant for DNA amplification further supports a function for DNA bent sites in DNA replication in eukaryotes.",M1
19150331,"The N-terminus of porcine circovirus type 2 replication protein is required for nuclear localization and <e>ori</e> binding activities.Porcine circovirus type 2 possesses a circular, single-stranded DNA genome that requires the replication protein (Rep) for virus replication. To characterize the DNA binding potential and the significant region that confers the nuclear localization of the Rep protein, the defined coding regions of rep gene were cloned and expressed. All of the recombinant proteins except for the N-terminal 110 residues deletion mutant could bind to the double-stranded minimal binding site of replication origin (ori). In addition, the N-terminal deletion mutant lacking 110 residues exhibited mainly cytoplasmic staining in the transfected cells in contrast to the others, which localized dominantly in the nucleus, suggesting that this N-terminal domain is essential for nuclear localization. Furthermore, a series of green fluorescence proteins (GFP) containing potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences were tested for their cellular distribution. The ability of the utmost 20 residues of the N-terminal region to target the GFP to the nucleus confirmed its role as a functional NLS.",M1
19057667,"Asymmetry of chromosome Replichores renders the DNA translocase activity of FtsK essential for cell division and cell shape maintenance in Escherichia coli.Bacterial chromosomes are organised as two replichores of opposite polarity that coincide with the replication arms from the <e>ori</e> to the ter region. Here, we investigated the effects of asymmetry in replichore organisation in Escherichia coli. We show that large chromosome inversions from the terminal junction of the replichores disturb the ongoing post-replicative events, resulting in inhibition of both cell division and cell elongation. This is accompanied by alterations of the segregation pattern of loci located at the inversion endpoints, particularly of the new replichore junction. None of these defects is suppressed by restoration of termination of replication opposite oriC, indicating that they are more likely due to the asymmetry of replichore polarity than to asymmetric replication. Strikingly, DNA translocation by FtsK, which processes the terminal junction of the replichores during cell division, becomes essential in inversion-carrying strains. Inactivation of the FtsK translocation activity leads to aberrant cell morphology, strongly suggesting that it controls membrane synthesis at the division septum. Our results reveal that FtsK mediates a reciprocal control between processing of the replichore polarity junction and cell division.",M1
18948737,"Beyond heterochromatin: SIR2 inhibits the initiation of DNA replication.Over the last decade, data have accumulated that support a role for chromatin structure in regulating the initiation of DNA replication and its timing during S-phase. However, the mechanisms underlying how chromatin structure influences replication initiation are not always understood. For example, in Drosophila histone acetylation at the ACE3 and <e>Ori</e>-beta sequences near one of the amplified chorion loci is correlated with ORC (origin recognition complex) binding and re-replication of this locus. Whether histone acetylation promotes ORC binding or some later step in replication is not known. In yeast, hypo-acetylated heterochromatin and telomeric regions replicate late in S-phase but the mechanisms that restrict the initiation of replication at these loci are not fully understood. Nonetheless, it seems likely that histone acetylation and other types of histone modification will significantly impact DNA replication. A recent study published in Molecular Cell reveals a role for the conserved NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase, Sir2, in inhibiting the assembly of the multiprotein complex necessary for the selection and activation of yeast replication origins. Here, we highlight key conclusions from this study, place them in perspective with earlier work, and outline important future questions.",M1
18805089,"A self-associating protein critical for chromosome attachment, division, and polar organization in caulobacter.Cell polarization is an integral part of many unrelated bacterial processes. How intrinsic cell polarization is achieved is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that Caulobacter crescentus uses a multimeric pole-organizing factor (PopZ) that serves as a hub to concurrently achieve several polarizing functions. During chromosome segregation, polar PopZ captures the ParB*<e>ori</e> complex and thereby anchors sister chromosomes at opposite poles. This step is essential for stabilizing bipolar gradients of a cell division inhibitor and setting up division near midcell. PopZ also affects polar stalk morphogenesis and mediates the polar localization of the morphogenetic and cell cycle signaling proteins CckA and DivJ. Polar accumulation of PopZ, which is central to its polarizing activity, can be achieved independently of division and does not appear to be dictated by the pole curvature. Instead, evidence suggests that localization of PopZ largely relies on PopZ multimerization in chromosome-free regions, consistent with a self-organizing mechanism.",M1
18621728,"Identifying a property of origins of DNA synthesis required to support plasmids stably in human cells.The plasmid origin of replication, oriP, of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) was identified in an assay to detect autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) in human cells. Raji <e>ori</e>, a second origin in EBV, functions in vivo but fails in long-term ARS assays. We examined the initiating element, DS, within oriP and Raji ori to resolve this paradox. DS, but not Raji ori, binds EBNA1; whereas both act as ARSs in short-term assays, with DS being more efficient, only DS can act as an ARS in long-term assays. Surprisingly, we found that DS supported the establishment of a plasmid with Raji ori in cis and that after deletion of DS, Raji ori could now act as an ARS in the long term. This finding explains the frequent failure of ARS assays in mammalian cells. More origins can initially act as ARSs than can be established. We identified one requirement for ARSs to be established: They must function efficiently enough initially to generate a wide distribution of numbers of plasmids per cell. Only the cells that have more than a threshold number of plasmids can survive selections imposed on the cells to retain these replicons.",M1
18514058,"The rat mitochondrial <e>Ori</e> L encodes a novel small RNA resembling an ancestral tRNA.The RNA minihelix, a proposed tRNA precursor, exhibits tRNA-like properties. Sequence-specific RNA minihelices can inhibit cell growth probably due to their binding to the cognate tRNA and naturally occurring non-tRNA substrates for aminoacylation may serve a similar purpose. Thus far, no natural RNA minihelices have been found. In the present study, we found a novel small RNA of 32 nucleotides, which is expressed abundantly in all rat tissues tested. Distinct from all of known endogenous small RNAs, this small RNA (temporarily named as tpl-sRNA) can form an RNA minihelix containing a stem-loop domain followed by ACCA. tpl-sRNA is encoded by the light-strand replication origin (Ori L) of the rat mitochondrial genome, and the 3'-terminal CCA of tpl-sRNA is post-transcriptionally added. Moreover, tpl-sRNA is chargeable in vivo. Our study demonstrates for the first time an endogenous small RNA that resembles an ancestral tRNA and exhibits some tRNA-like properties in mammals.",M1
18477575,"Origins of replication in Sorangium cellulosum and Microcystis aeruginosa.The genome of Sorangium cellulosum has recently been completely sequenced, and it is the largest bacterial genome sequenced so far. In their report, Schneiker et al. (in Complete genome sequence of the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum, Nat. Biotechnol., 2007, 25, 1281-1289) concluded that 'In the absence of the GC-skew inversion typically seen at the replication origin of bacterial chromosomes, it was not possible to discern the location of oriC'. In addition, the complete genome of Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-843 has also been recently sequenced, and in this report, Kaneko et al. (in Complete genomic structure of the bloom-forming toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-843, DNA Res., 2007, 14, 247-256) concluded that 'there was no characteristic pattern, according to GC skew analysis'. Therefore, oriC locations of the above genomes remain unsolved. Using <e>Ori</e>-Finder, a recently developed computer program, in both genomes, we have identified candidate oriC regions that have almost all sequence hallmarks of bacterial oriCs, such as asymmetrical nucleotide distributions, being adjacent to the dnaN gene, and containing DnaA boxes and repeat elements.",M1
18456838,"Regression supports two mechanisms of fork processing in phage T4.Replication forks routinely encounter damaged DNA and tightly bound proteins, leading to fork stalling and inactivation. To complete DNA synthesis, it is necessary to remove fork-blocking lesions and reactivate stalled fork structures, which can occur by multiple mechanisms. To study the mechanisms of stalled fork reactivation, we used a model fork intermediate, the origin fork, which is formed during replication from the bacteriophage T4 origin, <e>ori</e>(34). The origin fork accumulates within the T4 chromosome in a site-specific manner without the need for replication inhibitors or DNA damage. We report here that the origin fork is processed in vivo to generate a regressed fork structure. Furthermore, origin fork regression supports two mechanisms of fork resolution that can potentially lead to fork reactivation. Fork regression generates both a site-specific double-stranded end (DSE) and a Holliday junction. Each of these DNA elements serves as a target for processing by the T4 ATPase/exonuclease complex [gene product (gp) 46/47] and Holliday junction-cleaving enzyme (EndoVII), respectively. In the absence of both gp46 and EndoVII, regressed origin forks are stabilized and persist throughout infection. In the presence of EndoVII, but not gp46, there is significantly less regressed origin fork accumulation apparently due to cleavage of the regressed fork Holliday junction. In the presence of gp46, but not EndoVII, regressed origin fork DSEs are processed by degradation of the DSE and a pathway that includes recombination proteins. Although both mechanisms can occur independently, they may normally function together as a single fork reactivation pathway.",M1
18267969,"A DNA-binding activity in BPV initiator protein E1 required for melting duplex <e>ori</e> DNA but not processive helicase activity initiated on partially single-stranded DNA.The papillomavirus replication protein E1 assembles on the viral origin of replication (ori) as a series of complexes. It has been proposed that the ori DNA is first melted by a head-to-tail double trimer of E1 that evolves into two hexamers that encircle and unwind DNA bi-directionally. Here the role of a conserved lysine residue in the smaller tier or collar of the E1 helicase domain in ori processing is described. Unlike the residues of the AAA+ domain DNA-binding segments (beta-hairpin and hydrophobic loop; larger tier), this residue functions in the initial melting of duplex ori DNA but not in the processive DNA unwinding of partially single-stranded test substrates. These data therefore define a new DNA-binding related activity in the E1 protein and demonstrate that separate functional elements for DNA melting and helicase activity can be distinguished. New insights into the mechanism of ori melting are elaborated, suggesting the coordinated involvement of rigid and flexible DNA-binding components in E1.",M1
18245449,"Overreplication of short DNA regions during S phase in human cells.DNA replication origins (<e>ORI</e>) are regulatory regions from which the genome is replicated once every cell cycle. A widely used method for their identification in mammalian chromosomes relies on quantitative PCR of DNA nascent strands across candidate regions. We developed a new high-resolution PCR strategy to localize ORIs directly on total unfractionated human DNA. The increase in sensitivity provided by this approach has revealed that a short region of approximately 200-base-pair overlapping well-characterized replication origins undergoes several rounds of replication, coinciding with their specific time of activation during S phase. This process generates a population of discrete dsDNA fragments detectable as free molecules in preparations of total DNA in normally proliferating cells. Overreplicated regions have precise boundaries at the edge of the nucleosome-free gap that encompasses the transcription initiation sites of CpG island promoters. By itself, active transcription does not induce overreplication but does stimulate it at ORIs associated with promoters. The coincidence in time and space between the overproduction of short DNA fragments and ORI activity predicts the precise localization of thousands of ORIs in the human genome and uncovers a previously unnoticed step in the initiation of DNA replication.",M1
18239897,"The relaxing <e>ori</e>-ter balance of Mycoplasma genomes.Mycoplasma are wall-less bacteria with small genomes, which are thought to have resulted from massive genome reductive processes, during which the ori-ter balance may be disrupted. For technical difficulties, ori and ter have been located only in a few Mycoplasma strains. Using the Z curve method, we were able to locate turning points on the Mycoplasma genomes, with the minimum and maximum points co-locating with ori or ter in the reference genomes. Assuming Z curve correctly located ori and ter, we calculated the distances from ori to ter in both directions on the circular genome and calculated the ori-ter balance status. The Mycoplasma genomes were not balanced, possibly as a result of close association of Mycoplasma with hosts, where there would be no other microbes for Mycoplasma to compete with for nutrients, so fastest possible growth related to balanced genomes might not be needed by Mycoplasma, leading to a relaxing ori-ter balance.",M1
18237442,"<e>Ori</e>-Finder: a web-based system for finding oriCs in unannotated bacterial genomes.BACKGROUND: Chromosomal replication is the central event in the bacterial cell cycle. Identification of replication origins (oriCs) is necessary for almost all newly sequenced bacterial genomes. Given the increasing pace of genome sequencing, the current available software for predicting oriCs, however, still leaves much to be desired. Therefore, the increasing availability of genome sequences calls for improved software to identify oriCs in newly sequenced and unannotated bacterial genomes. RESULTS: We have developed Ori-Finder, an online system for finding oriCs in bacterial genomes based on an integrated method comprising the analysis of base composition asymmetry using the Z-curve method, distribution of DnaA boxes, and the occurrence of genes frequently close to oriCs. The program can also deal with unannotated genome sequences by integrating the gene-finding program ZCURVE 1.02. Output of the predicted results is exported to an HTML report, which offers convenient views on the results in both graphical and tabular formats. CONCLUSION: A web-based system to predict replication origins of bacterial genomes has been presented here. Based on this system, oriC regions have been predicted for the bacterial genomes available in GenBank currently. It is hoped that Ori-Finder will become a useful tool for the identification and analysis of oriCs in both bacterial and archaeal genomes.",M1
18085828,"Chromosome structuring limits genome plasticity in Escherichia coli.Chromosome organizations of related bacterial genera are well conserved despite a very long divergence period. We have assessed the forces limiting bacterial genome plasticity in Escherichia coli by measuring the respective effect of altering different parameters, including DNA replication, compositional skew of replichores, coordination of gene expression with DNA replication, replication-associated gene dosage, and chromosome organization into macrodomains. Chromosomes were rearranged by large inversions. Changes in the compositional skew of replichores, in the coordination of gene expression with DNA replication or in the replication-associated gene dosage have only a moderate effect on cell physiology because large rearrangements inverting the orientation of several hundred genes inside a replichore are only slightly detrimental. By contrast, changing the balance between the two replication arms has a more drastic effect, and the recombinational rescue of replication forks is required for cell viability when one of the chromosome arms is less than half than the other one. Macrodomain organization also appears to be a major factor restricting chromosome plasticity, and two types of inverted configurations severely affect the cell cycle. First, the disruption of the Ter macrodomain with replication forks merging far from the normal replichore junction provoked chromosome segregation defects. The second major problematic configurations resulted from inversions between <e>Ori</e> and Right macrodomains, which perturb nucleoid distribution and early steps of cytokinesis. Consequences for the control of the bacterial cell cycle and for the evolution of bacterial chromosome configuration are discussed.",M1
18067922,"Remodeling of the human papillomavirus type 11 replication origin into discrete nucleoprotein particles and looped structures by the E2 protein.The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA replication origin (<e>ori</e>) shares a common theme with many DNA control elements in having multiple binding sites for one or more proteins spaced over several hundreds of base pairs. The HPV type 11 ori spans 103 bp and contains three palindromic E2 binding sites (E2BS-2, E2BS-3, and E2BS-4) for the dimeric E2 ori binding protein. These sites are separated by 64 and 3 bp. E2BS-1 is located 288 bp upstream of E2BS-2 and is not required for efficient transient or cell-free replication. In this study, electron microscopy was used to visualize complexes of HPV-11 DNA ori bound by purified E2 protein. DNA containing only E2BS-2 showed a single E2 dimer bound. DNA containing E2BS-3 and E2BS-4 showed two side-by-side E2 dimers, while DNA containing E2BS-2, E2BS-3, and E2BS-4 exhibited a large disk/ring-shaped protein particle bound, indicating that the DNA had been remodeled into a discrete complex, likely containing an E2 hexamer. With all four binding sites present, up to 27% of the DNA molecules were arranged into loops by E2, the majority of which spanned E2BS-1 and one of the other three sites. Studies on the dependence of looping on salt, ATP, and DTT using full-length E2 and an E2 protein containing only the carboxyl-terminal DNA binding and protein dimerization domain suggest that looping is dependent on the N-terminal domain and factors that may affect the manner in which E2 scans DNA for binding sites. The role of these structures in the modeling and regulation of the HPV-11 ori is discussed.",M1
17933778,"Atomic force microscopy of DNA in solution and DNA modelling show that structural properties specify the eukaryotic replication initiation site.The replication origins (<e>ORIs</e>) of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, like those in most eukaryotes, are long chromosomal regions localized within A+T-rich domains. Although there is no consensus sequence, the interacting proteins are strongly conserved, suggesting that DNA structure is important for ORI function. We used atomic force microscopy in solution and DNA modelling to study the structural properties of the Spars1 origin. We show that this segment is the least stable of the surrounding DNA (9 kb), and contains regions of intrinsically bent elements (strongly curved and inherently supercoiled DNAs). The pORC-binding site co-maps with a superhelical DNA region, where the spatial arrangement of adenine/thymine stretches may provide the binding substrate. The replication initiation site (RIP) is located within a strongly curved DNA region. On pORC unwinding, this site shifts towards the apex of the curvature, thus potentiating DNA melting there. Our model is entirely consistent with the sequence variability, large size and A+T-richness of ORIs, and also accounts for the multistep nature of the initiation process, the specificity of pORC-binding site(s), and the specific location of RIP. We show that the particular DNA features and dynamic properties identified in Spars1 are present in other eukaryotic origins.",M1

The pFL129 replicon encodes the wild-type initiation replication protein pi, while plasmids pFL130 and pAG101 encode mutant forms of the pi protein conferring the plasmid copy-up phenotype. Plasmids could be transferred to all recipient species tested, although high efficiency conjugal transfer was only obtained with genera of the Enterobacteriaceae. The efficiency of plasmid transfer to all recipients was lower for the copy-up derivatives, pFL130 and pAG101, than for pFL129. The three gamma ori replicons were stably maintained in all transconjugants except pFL129 in Listeria monocytogenes. The two mutant plasmids retained their copy-up phenotype in the new bacterial hosts.",M1
17609856,"Plasmid profile and construction of a small shuttle vector in Laribacter hongkongensis.Among 21 human strains of Laribacter hongkongensis, small plasmids were observed in four strains, and large ones in six strains. The smallest, 3264-bp plasmid, pHLHK19, has only one ORF that encodes a putative replication initiator protein and a predicted origin of replication (<e>ori</e>) with a DnaA box, three 18-bp direct repeats and five pairs of inverted repeats. An Escherichia coli-L. hongkongensis shuttle vector was constructed by ligating the HindIII-digested pHLHK19, containing the replication initiator protein and ori of pHLHK19, to HindIII-digested pBK-CMV. This shuttle vector can propagate in E. coli and L. hongkongensis with good transformation efficiencies.",M1
17584494,"New criteria for selecting the origin of DNA replication in Wolbachia and closely related bacteria.BACKGROUND: The annotated genomes of two closely related strains of the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia pipientis have been reported without the identifications of the putative origin of replication (<e>ori</e>). Identifying the ori of these bacteria and related alpha-Proteobacteria as well as their patterns of sequence evolution will aid studies of cell replication and cell density, as well as the potential genetic manipulation of these widespread intracellular bacteria. RESULTS: Using features that have been previously experimentally verified in the alpha-Proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus, the origin of DNA replication (ori) regions were identified in silico for Wolbachia strains and eleven other related bacteria belonging to Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Rickettsia genera. These features include DnaA-, CtrA- and IHF-binding sites as well as the flanking genes in C. crescentus. The Wolbachia ori boundary genes were found to be hemE and COG1253 protein (CBS domain protein). Comparisons of the putative ori region among related Wolbachia strains showed higher conservation of bases within binding sites. CONCLUSION: The sequences of the ori regions described here are only similar among closely related bacteria while fundamental characteristics like presence of DnaA and IHF binding sites as well as the boundary genes are more widely conserved. The relative paucity of CtrA binding sites in the ori regions, as well as the absence of key enzymes associated with DNA replication in the respective genomes, suggest that several of these obligate intracellular bacteria may have altered replication mechanisms. Based on these analyses, criteria are set forth for identifying the ori region in genome sequencing projects.",M1
17526779,"Comparative sequence analysis of plasmids from Lactobacillus delbrueckii and construction of a shuttle cloning vector.While plasmids are very commonly associated with the majority of the lactic acid bacteria, they are only very rarely associated with Lactobacillus delbrueckii, with only four characterized to date. In this study, the complete sequence of a native plasmid, pDOJ1, from a strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was determined. It consisted of a circular DNA molecule of 6,220 bp with a G+C content of 44.6% and a characteristic <e>ori</e> and encoded six open reading frames (ORFs), of which functions could be predicted for three-a mobilization (Mob) protein, a transposase, and a fused primase-helicase replication protein. Comparative analysis of pDOJ1 and the other available L. delbrueckii plasmids (pLBB1, pJBL2, pN42, and pLL1212) revealed a very similar organization and amino acid identities between 85 and 98% for the putative proteins of all six predicted ORFs from pDOJ1, reflecting a common origin for L. delbrueckii plasmids. Analysis of the fused primase-helicase replication gene found a similar fused organization only in the theta replicating group B plasmids from Streptococcus thermophilus. This observation and the ability of the replicon to function in S. thermophilus support the idea that the origin of plasmids in L. delbrueckii was likely from S. thermophilus. This may reflect the close association of these two species in dairy fermentations, particularly yogurt production. As no vector based on plasmid replicons from L. delbrueckii has previously been constructed, an Escherichia coli-L. delbrueckii shuttle cloning vector, pDOJ4, was constructed from pDOJ1, the p15A ori, the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pCI372, and the lacZ polylinker from pUC18. This cloning vector was successfully introduced into E. coli, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis. This shuttle cloning vector provides a new tool for molecular analysis of Lactobacillus delbrueckii and other lactic acid bacteria.",M1
17497233,"Homologous recombination plays minor role in excision of unit-length viral genomes from head-to-tail direct tandem repeats of porcine circovirus during DNA replication in Escherichia coli.In this report, we confirmed previous work that a theta-replicating bacterial plasmid containing 1.75 copies of genomic porcine circovirus (PCV) DNA in head-to-tail tandem (HTT) [a partial copy of PCV type 1 (PCV1), a complete copy of PCV type 2 (PCV2) and two origins of DNA replication (<e>Ori</e>)] yielded three different double-stranded DNA species when transformed into Escherichia coli: the input construct (U), the unit-length PCV1/PCV2 genome with a composite Ori lacking the plasmid vector (Q(RC)) and the remaining left-over 0.75 copy PCV1/PCV2 genome with a different composite Ori inserted in the plasmid vector (L(RC)). Replication of U was presumably via the theta-like replication mechanism utilizing the colicin E1 Ori, while derivation of L(RC) and Q(RC) was via the rolling-circle replication (RCR) copy-release mechanism and required the presence of two PCV Oris and the virus-encoded Rep protein. Essentially, excision of a unit-length PCV1/PCV2 genome (Q(RC)) via RCR from U yielded L(RC). Furthermore, we examined whether homologous recombination may also result in excision of a different type of unit-length PCV genome (Q(H)) from identical HTT constructs to generate L(H). Whereas the generation of L(RC) is Rep-protein-dependent, the generation of L(H) is Rep-protein-independent. Accordingly, the L(RC) and Q(RC) molecules derived from RCR possess different characteristics from the L(H) and Q(H) molecules generated via homologous recombination. In one of the studies in which both L(RC) and L(H) were generated simultaneously from the same HTT construct, out of 69 samples analyzed, 66 were derived via RCR and 3 were derived via homologous recombination. Thus, in comparison with RCR, homologous recombination plays a minor role in the excision of unit-length PCV genomes from HTT constructs in Escherichia coli.",M1
17478495,"Transcription activator structure reveals redox control of a replication initiation reaction.Redox changes are one of the factors that influence cell-cycle progression and that control the processes of cellular proliferation, differentiation, senescence and apoptosis. Proteins regulated through redox-sensitive cysteines have been characterized but specific 'sulphydryl switches' in replication proteins remain to be identified. In bovine papillomavirus type-1, DNA replication begins when the viral transcription factor E2 recruits the viral initiator protein E1 to the origin of DNA replication (<e>ori</e>). Here we show that a novel dimerization interface in the E2 transcription activation domain is stabilized by a disulphide bond. Oxidative cross-linking via Cys57 sequesters the interaction surface between E1 and E2, preventing pre-initiation and replication initiation complex formation. Our data demonstrate that as well as a mechanism for regulating DNA binding, redox reactions can control replication by modulating the tertiary structure of critical protein factors using a specific redox sensor.",M1
17470061,"Targeted inactivation of the tobacco plastome origins of replication A and B.According to the Kolodner and Tewari model [Kolodner, R.D. and Tewari, K.K. (1975) Nature, 256, 708.], plastid DNA replication involves displacement-loop and rolling-circle modes of replication, which are initiated on a pair of origins of replication (<e>ori</e>). In accordance with the model, such a pair of oris -oriA and oriB- was described in Nicotiana tabacum [Kunnimalaiyaan, M. and Nielsen B.L. (1997b) Nucl. Acids Res. 25, 3681.]. However, as reported previously, both copies of oriA can be deleted without abolishing replication. Deletion of both oriBs was not found [Mühlbauer, S.K. et al. (2002) Plant J. 32, 175.]. Here we describe new ori inactivation lines, in which one oriB is deleted and the other copy is strongly mutated. In addition, lines oriA and oriB were deleted from the same inverted repeat. In contrast to the expectations of the model, neither oriA nor oriB is essential. Some of the deletions led to reduced growth of plants and reduced plastid DNA copy number in later stages of leaf development. The gross structure of plastid DNA was unchanged; however, the location of the ends of branched plastid DNA complexes was different in the inactivation mutants. Taken together, the results indicate that there are additional mechanisms of plastid DNA replication and/or additional origins of replication. These mechanisms seem to be different from those found in eubacteria, which, according to the endosymbiont theory, are the progenitors of plastids.",M1
17464080,"Modulation of lambda plasmid and phage DNA replication by Escherichia coli SeqA protein.SeqA protein, a main negative regulator of the replication initiation of the Escherichia coli chromosome, also has several other functions which are still poorly understood. It was demonstrated previously that in seqA mutants the copy number of another replicon, the lambda plasmid, is decreased, and that the activity of the lambda p(R) promoter (whose function is required for stimulation of <e>ori</e> lambda) is lower than that in the wild-type host. Here, SeqA-mediated regulation of lambda phage and plasmid replicons was investigated in more detail. No significant influence of SeqA on ori lambda-dependent DNA replication in vitro was observed, indicating that a direct regulation of lambda DNA replication by this protein is unlikely. On the other hand, density-shift experiments, in which the fate of labelled lambda DNA was monitored after phage infection of host cells, strongly suggested the early appearance of sigma replication intermediates and preferential rolling-circle replication of phage DNA in seqA mutants. The directionality of lambda plasmid replication in such mutants was, however, only slightly affected. The stability of the heritable lambda replication complex was decreased in the seqA mutant relative to the wild-type host, but a stable fraction of the lambda O protein was easily detectable, indicating that such a heritable complex can function in the mutant. To investigate the influence of seqA gene function on heritable complex- and transcription-dependent lambda DNA replication, the efficiency of lambda plasmid replication in amino acid-starved relA seqA mutants was measured. Under these conditions, seqA dysfunction resulted in impairment of lambda plasmid replication. These results indicate that unlike oriC, SeqA modulates lambda DNA replication indirectly, most probably by influencing the stability of the lambda replication complex and the transcriptional activation of ori lambda.",M1
17432940,"An intrastrain variation of a 189-bp repeat region in the human cytomegalovirus replication origin.A 189-bp repeat has been reported previously to be present in the replication origin (<e>ORI</e>) of Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Towne strain and to contain essential and supporting sequences (Chen et al., Arch. Virol. 141, 13301 (1996)). In this study, clones of HCMV strain Towne were isolated and analyzed for the copy number of the 189-bp repeat within its ORI (oriLyt). Southern blot analysis revealed that out of 14 clones, two contained a dimer, two contained a tetramer, and the remaining contained a trimer of the 189-bp repeat. Nucleotide sequence analysis disclosed that, within the dimer and the tetramer, the 189-bp repeat was present in a directly repeated manner. In this way we demonstrated an HCMV intrastrain variation in the copy number of the 189-bp repeat. Dot blot hybridization and growth curve analysis showed that the clones containing the dimer or the tetramer replicated in infected cells with similar efficiencies. We conclude that the HCMV oriLyt with spatial separation of the essential flanking regions by various copy number of the 189-bp repeat acts as ORI in the viral genome.",M1
17383678,"Mechanism of origin activation by monomers of R6K-encoded pi protein.One recurring theme in plasmid duplication is the recognition of the origin of replication (<e>ori</e>) by specific Rep proteins that bind to DNA sequences called iterons. For plasmid R6K, this process involves a complex interplay between monomers and dimers of the Rep protein, pi, with seven tandem iterons of gamma ori. Remarkably, both pi monomers and pi dimers can bind to iterons, a new paradigm in replication control. Dimers, the predominant form in the cell, inhibit replication, while monomers facilitate open complex formation and activate the ori. Here, we investigate a mechanism by which pi monomers out-compete pi dimers for iteron binding, and in so doing activate the ori. With an in vivo plasmid incompatibility assay, we find that pi monomers bind cooperatively to two adjacent iterons. Cooperative binding is eliminated by insertion of a half-helical turn between two iterons but is diminished only slightly by insertion of a full helical turn between two iterons. These studies show also that pi bound to a consensus site promotes occupancy of an adjacent mutated site, another hallmark of cooperative interactions. pi monomer/iteron interactions were quantified using a monomer-biased pi variant in vitro with the same collection of two-iteron constructs. The cooperativity coefficients mirror the plasmid incompatibility results for each construct tested. pi dimer/iteron interactions were quantified with a dimer-biased mutant in vitro and it was found that pi dimers bind with negligible cooperativity to two tandem iterons.",M1

17241905,"Multiple functions of the origin recognition complex.The origin recognition complex (ORC), a heteromeric six-subunit protein, is a central component for eukaryotic DNA replication. The ORC binds to DNA at replication origin sites in an ATP-dependent manner and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of other key initiation factors. Sequence rules for ORC-DNA binding appear to vary widely. In budding yeast the ORC recognizes specific <e>ori</e> elements, however, in higher eukaryotes origin site selection does not appear to depend on the specific DNA sequence. In metazoans, during cell cycle progression, one or more of the ORC subunits can be modified in such a way that ORC activity is inhibited until mitosis is complete and a nuclear membrane is assembled. In addition to its well-documented role in the initiation of DNA replication, the ORC is also involved in other cell functions. Some of these activities directly link cell cycle progression with DNA replication, while other functions seem distinct from replication. The function of ORCs in the establishment of transcriptionally repressed regions is described for many species and may be a conserved feature common for both unicellular eukaryotes and metazoans. ORC subunits were found at centrosomes, at the cell membranes, at the cytokinesis furrows of dividing cells, as well as at the kinetochore. The exact mechanism of these localizations remains to be determined, however, latest results support the idea that ORC proteins participate in multiple aspects of the chromosome inheritance cycle. In this review, we discuss the participation of ORC proteins in various cell functions, in addition to the canonical role of ORC in initiating DNA replication.",M1
17226771,"Dissection of mammalian replicators by a novel plasmid stability assay.A plasmid, bearing a mammalian replication initiation region (IR) and a matrix attachment region (MAR) was previously shown to be efficiently amplified to high copy number in mammalian cells and to generate chromosomal homogeneously staining regions (HSRs). The amplification mechanism was suggested to entail a head-on collision at the MAR between the transcription machinery and the hypothetical replication fork arriving from the IR, leading to double strand breakage (DSB) that triggered HSR formation. The experiments described here show that such plasmids are stabilized if collisions involving not only promoter-driven transcription but also promoter-independent transcription are avoided, and stable plasmids appeared to persist as submicroscopic episomes. These findings suggest that the IR sequence that promotes HSR generation may correspond to the sequence that supports replication initiation (replicator). Thus, we developed a  plasmid stability assay  that sensitively detects the activity of HSR generation in a test sequence. The assay was used to dissect two replicator regions, derived from the c-myc and DHFR <e>ori</e>-beta loci. Consequently, minimum sequences that efficiently promoted HSR generation were identified. They included several sequence elements, most of which coincided with reported replicator elements. These data and this assay will benefit studies of replication initiation and applications that depend on plasmid amplification.",M1
17204346,"Unit-length, single-stranded circular DNAs of both polarity of begomoviruses are generated in Escherichia coli harboring phage M13-cloned begomovirus genome with single copy of replication origin.Replication of genomic DNAs of plant-pathogenic begomoviruses has been demonstrated in prokaryotes, which supported the possibility of analyzing DNA replication process of begomoviruses in bacteria. However, previous studies indicated that the replication of begomovirus DNAs in prokaryotes requires tandem constructs of viral genomes with at least two copies of the origin of replication (<e>ori</e>). In this study, phage M13 vector harboring the unit-length genome with only a single copy of ori of a mono-partite begomovirus, Ageratum yellow vein virus PD isolate (AYVV-[PD]), was constructed and used to investigate the replication of AYVV-[PD] DNAs in Escherichia coli. The generation of single-stranded, circular DNAs (sscDNAs) corresponding to the unit-length AYVV-[PD] genome of both polarity was observed and verified. Replication-associated (Rep) protein of AYVV-[PD] was detected only in bacteria generating the corresponding sscDNAs, whereas disruption of the Rep gene abolished the phenomenon. The results suggested that a single copy of ori is sufficient for the prokaryotes to support the generation of unit-length, genomic sscDNAs of begomoviruses, which requires the presence of functional Rep protein.",M1
17182000,"The ColE2-P9 Rep protein binds to the origin DNA as a monomer.The Rep proteins of some plasmid replicons have two functions. Dimers bind to the operator sequences acting as auto-repressors, whereas monomers bind to the iterons to initiate replication of DNA. The ColE2 Rep proteins are present mostly in a dimeric form with some multimers larger than dimers in solution, while the form of Rep binding to <e>Ori</e> is not known. We used an EMSA-based method to determine the molecular weight of Rep in the Rep-Ori complex. The result suggested that Rep binds to Ori as a monomer. In addition, the result of EMSA using the Rep protein fused with the maltose binding protein and the His6-tag also supported this conclusion. We proposed that dimerization of Rep might probably be involved in keeping the copy number of the ColE2 plasmid at the normal low level by limiting the amount of active monomeric forms of Rep in the host cell.",M1
17139255,"Structure of the origin-binding domain of simian virus 40 large T antigen bound to DNA.The large T antigen (T-ag) protein binds to and activates DNA replication from the origin of DNA replication (<e>ori</e>) in simian virus 40 (SV40). Here, we determined the crystal structures of the T-ag origin-binding domain (OBD) in apo form, and bound to either a 17 bp palindrome (sites 1 and 3) or a 23 bp ori DNA palindrome comprising all four GAGGC binding sites for OBD. The T-ag OBDs were shown to interact with the DNA through a loop comprising Ser147-Thr155 (A1 loop), a combination of a DNA-binding helix and loop (His203-Asn210), and Asn227. The A1 loop traveled back-and-forth along the major groove and accounted for most of the sequence-determining contacts with the DNA. Unexpectedly, in both T-ag-DNA structures, the T-ag OBDs bound DNA independently and did not make direct protein-protein contacts. The T-ag OBD was also captured bound to a non-consensus site ATGGC even in the presence of its canonical site GAGGC. Our observations taken together with the known biochemical and structural features of the T-ag-origin interaction suggest a model for origin unwinding.",M1
17137626,"Functional analysis of ori1 and repA of the R-plasmid pSJ5.6 from Neisseria gonorrhoeae.The functional ori1 of the 5.6kb gonococcal R-plasmid pSJ5.6 contains an A-T rich region followed by four 22bp direct repeats and one 19bp inverted repeat. The replication region of the plasmid also contains a gene encoding for a 39kD RepA protein. We have further assessed the functionality of the replication region in pSJ5.6, an-iteron type plasmid, using in vivo complementation assays in Escherichia coli. A 2.1kb PstI-RsaI fragment containing the ori1 and repA gene of pSJ5.6 was cloned into vector pZErO -2 to obtain pZA-MRR. The pUC origin in pZA-MRR was deleted to render the plasmid dependable on the cis-acting ori1 for replication. The resulting plasmid, pMRR, was capable of replication and maintenance in E. coli. We also cloned the ori1 and repA gene separately to obtain pA-<e>Ori</e> and pZG-Rep, respectively. Using in vivo complementation assays, we demonstrated that the ori1(+) plasmid (pA-Ori) was maintained only when the RepA protein was supplied in trans by the high copy number plasmid pZG-Rep.",M1
17098894,"Specific interaction between the initiator protein (Rep) and origin of plasmid ColE2-P9.The replication initiator protein (Rep) of plasmid ColE2-P9 (ColE2) is multifunctional. We are interested in how Rep binds to the origin (<e>Ori</e>) to perform various functions. We used the wild type and variants of Rep to study the Rep-Ori interaction by both in vitro and in vivo approaches, including biochemical analyses of protein-DNA interactions and an in vivo replication assay. We identified three regions (I, II, and III) of Rep, located in the C-terminal half, and three corresponding binding sites (I, II, and III) in Ori which are important for Rep-Ori interaction. We showed that region I, containing a putative helix-turn-helix motif, is necessary and sufficient for specific Ori recognition, interacting with site I of the origin DNA from the major groove. Region II interacts with site II of the origin DNA, from the adjacent minor groove in the left half of Ori, and region III interacts with site III, next to the template sequence for primer synthesis, which is one and one-half turn apart from site I on the opposite surface of the origin DNA. A putative linker region located between the two DNA binding domains (regions II and III) was identified, which might provide Rep an extended conformation suitable for binding to the two separate sites in Ori. Based on the results presented in this paper, we propose a model for Rep-Ori interaction in which Rep binds to Ori as a monomer.",M1

We report a detailed genetic analysis of the DiNucleotide Repeat (DNR) element, one of several sequence elements necessary for ectopic ori-beta activity. Deletions within ori-beta identified a 132 bp core region within the DNR element, consisting mainly of dinucleotide repeats, and a downstream region that are required for ori-beta initiation activity at non-specific ectopic sites in hamster cells. Replacement of the DNR element with Xenopus or mouse transcriptional elements from rDNA genes restored full levels of initiation activity, but replacement with a nucleosome positioning element or a viral intron sequence did not. The requirement for the DNR element and three other ori-beta sequence elements was conserved when ori-beta activity was tested at either random sites or at a single specific ectopic chromosomal site in human cells. These results confirm the importance of specific cis-acting elements in directing the initiation of DNA replication in mammalian cells, and provide new evidence that transcriptional elements can functionally substitute for one of these elements in ori-beta.",M1
17020951,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus <e>ori</e>-Lyt-dependent DNA replication: dual role of replication and transcription activator.Lytic replication of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is essential for viral propagation and pathogenicity. In Kaposi's sarcoma lesions, constant lytic replication plays a role in sustaining the population of latently infected cells that otherwise are quickly lost by segregation of latent viral episomes as spindle cells divide. Lytic DNA replication initiates from an origin (ori-Lyt) and requires trans-acting elements. Two functional ori-Lyts have been identified in the KSHV genome. Some cis-acting and trans-acting elements for ori-Lyt-dependent DNA replication have been found. Among these, K8 binding sites, a cluster of C/EBP binding motifs, and a replication and transcription activator (RTA) responsive element (RRE) are crucial cis-acting elements. Binding of K8 and RTA proteins to these motifs in ori-Lyt DNA was demonstrated to be absolutely essential for DNA replication. In the present study, functional roles of RTA in ori-Lyt-dependent DNA replication have been investigated. Two distinct functions of RTA were revealed. First, RTA activates an ori-Lyt promoter and initiates transcription across GC-rich tandem repeats. This RTA-mediated transcription is indispensable for DNA replication. Second, RTA is a component of the replication compartment, where RTA interacts with prereplication complexes composed of at least six core machinery proteins and K8. The prereplication complexes are recruited to ori-Lyt DNA through RTA, which interacts with the RRE, as well as K8, which binds to a cluster of C/EBP binding motifs with the aid of C/EBP alpha. The revelation of these two functions of RTA, together with its role in initiation of a transcriptional cascade that leads to transcription of all viral lytic genes, shows that RTA is a critical initiator and regulator of KSHV lytic DNA replication and viral propagation.",M1
16912316,"Rolling-circle replication of an animal circovirus genome in a theta-replicating bacterial plasmid in Escherichia coli.A bacterial plasmid containing 1.75 copies of double-stranded porcine circovirus (PCV) DNA in tandem (0.8 copy of PCV type 1 [PCV1], 0.95 copy of PCV2) with two origins of DNA replication (<e>Ori</e>) yielded three different DNA species when transformed into Escherichia coli: the input construct, a unit-length chimeric PCV1(Rep)/PCV2(Cap) genome with a composite Ori but lacking the plasmid vector, and a molecule consisting of the remaining 0.75 copy PCV1(Cap)/PCV2(Rep) genome with a different composite Ori together with the bacterial plasmid. Replication of the input construct was presumably via the theta replication mechanism utilizing the ColE(1) Ori, while characteristics of the other two DNA species, including a requirement of two PCV Oris and the virus-encoded replication initiator Rep protein, suggest they were generated via the rolling-circle copy-release mechanism. Interestingly, the PCV-encoded Rep' protein essential for PCV DNA replication in mammalian cells was not required in bacteria. The fact that the Rep' protein function(s) can be compensated by the bacterial replication machinery to support the PCV DNA replication process echoes previous suggestions that circular single-stranded DNA animal circoviruses, plant geminiviruses, and nanoviruses may have evolved from prokaryotic episomal replicons.",M1
16738139,"Common determinants in DNA melting and helicase-catalysed DNA unwinding by papillomavirus replication protein E1.E1 and T-antigen of the tumour viruses bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) and Simian virus 40 (SV40) are the initiator proteins that recognize and melt their respective origins of replication in the initial phase of DNA replication. These proteins then assemble into processive hexameric helicases upon the single-stranded DNA that they create. In T-antigen, a characteristic loop and hairpin structure (the pre-sensor 1beta hairpin, PS1betaH) project into a central cavity generated by protein hexamerization. This channel undergoes large ATP-dependent conformational changes, and the loop/PS1betaH is proposed to form a DNA binding site critical for helicase activity. Here, we show that conserved residues in BPV E1 that probably form a similar loop/hairpin structure are required for helicase activity and also origin (<e>ori</e>) DNA melting. We propose that DNA melting requires the cooperation of the E1 helicase domain (E1HD) and the origin binding domain (OBD) tethered to DNA. One possible mechanism is that with the DNA locked in the loop/PS1betaH DNA binding site, ATP-dependent conformational changes draw the DNA inwards in a twisting motion to promote unwinding.",M1
16648467,"Mapping of DNA replication origins to noncoding genes of the X-inactivation center.In mammals, few DNA replication origins have been identified. Although there appears to be an association between origins and epigenetic regulation, their underlying link to monoallelic gene expression remains unclear. Here, we identify novel origins of DNA replication (<e>ORIs</e>) within the X-inactivation center (Xic). We analyze 86 kb of the Xic using an unbiased approach and find an unexpectedly large number of functional ORIs. Although there has been a tight correlation between ORIs and CpG islands, we find that ORIs are not restricted to CpG islands and there is no dependence on transcriptional activity. Interestingly, these ORIs colocalize to important genetic elements or genes involved in X-chromosome inactivation. One prominent ORI maps to the imprinting center and to a domain within Tsix known to be required for X-chromosome counting and choice. Location and/or activity of ORIs appear to be modulated by removal of specific Xic elements. These data provide a foundation for testing potential relationships between DNA replication and epigenetic regulation in future studies.",M1
16622012,"Replication initiation from a novel origin identified in the Th2 cytokine cluster locus requires a distant conserved noncoding sequence.Lineage commitment of Th cells is associated with the establishment of specific transcriptional programs of cytokines. However, how Th cell differentiation affects the program of DNA replication has not been addressed. To gain insight into interplays between differentiation-induced transcription regulation and initiation of DNA replication, we took advantage of an in vitro differentiation system of naive T cells, in which one can manipulate their differentiation into Th1 or Th2 cells. We searched for replication origins in the murine IL-4/IL-13 locus and compared their profiles in the two Th cell lineages which were derived in vitro from the same precursor T cells. We identified a replication origin (<e>ori</e>(IL-13)) downstream from exon 4 of IL-13 and showed that this origin functions in both Th2 and Th1 cells. A distant regulatory element called CNS-1 (conserved noncoding sequence 1) in the IL-4/IL-13 intergenic region coincides with a Th2-specific DNase I-hypersensitive site and is required for efficient, coordinated expression of Th2 cytokines. Replication initiation from ori(IL-13) is significantly reduced in Th1 and Th2 cells derived from CNS-1-deficient mice. However, the replication timing of this locus is consistently early during S phase in both Th1 and Th2 cells under either the wild-type or CNS-1 deletion background. Thus, the conserved noncoding element in the intergenic region regulates replication initiation from a distant replication origin in a manner independent from its effect on lineage-specific transcription but not the replication timing of the segment surrounding this origin.",M1

During the lytic cycle, the viral genome forms replication compartments, which are usually adjacent to promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies.

A point mutation in the oriCIVC sequence of the classical biotype of O1 serogroup led to the loss of a BglII site, which was utilized for differentiation from El Tor vibrios. Interestingly, the PCR assay amplified a similarly sized ori segment, designated as oriCIVM, from V. mimicus strains, but failed to produce any amplicon with other strains. Cloning and sequencing of the oriCIVM revealed high sequence similarity (96%) with oriCIVC. The results indicate that V. mimicus is indeed very closely related to V. cholerae. In addition, the BglII restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) between oriCIVM and oriCIVC sequences allowed us to differentiate the two species. The ori sequence-based PCR-RFLP assay developed in this study appears to be a useful method for rapid identification and differentiation of V. cholerae and V. mimicus strains, as well as for the delineation of classical and El Tor biotypes of V. cholerae O1.",M1
16481006,"Structural basis for the cooperative assembly of large T antigen on the origin of replication.Large T antigen (LTag) from simian virus 40 (SV40) is an ATP-driven DNA helicase that specifically recognizes the core of the viral origin of replication (<e>ori</e>), where it oligomerizes as a double hexamer. During this process, binding of the first hexamer stimulates the assembly of a second one. Using electron microscopy, we show that the N-terminal part of LTag that includes the origin-binding domain does not present a stable quaternary structure in single hexamers. This disordered region, however, is well arranged within the LTag double hexamer after specific ori recognition, where it mediates the interactions between hexamers and constructs a separated structural module at their junction. We conclude that full assembly of LTag hexamers occurs only within the dodecamer, and requires the specific hexamer-hexamer interactions established upon binding to the origin of replication. This mechanism provides the structural basis for the cooperative assembly of LTag double hexamer on the cognate viral ori.",M1
16427677,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 recombinants without the oriL sequence replicate DNA with increased fidelity.Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) contains three DNA replication origins (<e>ori</e>) of two types. The oriL is located in the center of the unique long sequences, whereas two copies of oriS, which are structurally different from oriL, are within the reiterated sequences flanking the unique short sequences. Recombinant viruses were constructed from ts+7, which contains a deletion of oriL sequences, to have either the beta-galactosidase gene or the supF amplicon integrated into the thymidine kinase locus. Rescue recombinants also were constructed from the supF-containing recombinant to restore the deleted oriL to the wild type sequences. These recombinants were subjected to mutagenesis assays. Results demonstrated that ts+7 viruses with the deletion in oriL sequences replicated both target genes with higher fidelity compared to those derived from the parental strain KOS. Possible mechanisms leading to the high fidelity of DNA replication mediated by viruses without intact oriL sequences are discussed.",M1
16364910,"Oligomeric initiator protein-mediated DNA looping negatively regulates plasmid replication in vitro by preventing origin melting.Although DNA looping between the initiator binding sites (iterons) of the replication origin (<e>ori</e>) of a plasmid and the iterons located in a cis-acting control sequence called inc has been postulated to promote negative control of plasmid DNA replication, not only was definitive evidence for such looping lacking, but also the detailed molecular mechanism of this control had not been elucidated. Here, we present direct evidence showing that both the monomeric and the dimeric forms of the RepE initiator protein of F factor together promote pairing of incC-oriF sites by DNA looping. By using a reconstituted replication system consisting of 26 purified proteins, we show further that the DNA loop formation negatively regulates plasmid replication by inhibiting the formation of an open complex at the replication origin, thus elucidating a key step of replication control.",M1
16237205,"Genome plasticity and <e>ori</e>-ter rebalancing in Salmonella typhi.Genome plasticity resulting from frequent rearrangement of the bacterial genome is a fascinating but poorly understood phenomenon. First reported in Salmonella typhi, it has been observed only in a small number of Salmonella serovars, although the over 2,500 known Salmonella serovars are all very closely related. To gain insights into this phenomenon and elucidate its roles in bacterial evolution, especially those involved in the formation of particular pathogens, we systematically analyzed the genomes of 127 wild-type S. typhi strains isolated from many places of the world and compared them with the two sequenced strains, Ty2 and CT18, attempting to find possible associations between genome rearrangement and other significant genomic features. Like other host-adapted Salmonella serovars, S. typhi contained large genome insertions, including the 134 kb Salmonella pathogenicity island, SPI7. Our analyses showed that SPI7 disrupted the physical balance of the bacterial genome between the replication origin (ori) and terminus (ter) when this DNA segment was inserted into the genome, and rearrangement in individual strains further changed the genome balance status, with a general tendency toward a better balanced genome structure. In a given S. typhi strain, genome diversification occurred and resulted in different structures among cells in the culture. Under a stressed condition, bacterial cells with better balanced genome structures were selected to greatly increase in proportion; in such cases, bacteria with better balanced genomes formed larger colonies and grew with shorter generation times. Our results support the hypothesis that genome plasticity as a result of frequent rearrangement provides the opportunity for the bacterial genome to adopt a better balanced structure and thus eventually stabilizes the genome during evolution.",M1
16045624,"Ability of IncP-9 plasmid pM3 to replicate in Escherichia coli is dependent on both rep and par functions.IncP-9 plasmids are common in Pseudomonas species and can be transferred to other Gram-negative eubacteria but tend not to be stably maintained outside their natural host genus. A 1.3 kb <e>ori</e> V-rep fragment from IncP-9 plasmid pM3 was sufficient for autonomous replication in Pseudomonas putida but not in Escherichia coli. Replication of ori V-rep in E. coli was restored when additional rep was provided in trans, suggesting that the replication defect resulted from insufficient rep expression from its natural promoter. A promoter deficiency in E. coli was confirmed by reporter gene assays, transcriptional start point mapping and mutation of the promoter recognition elements. Dissection of the pM3 mini-replicon, pMT2, showed that this replication deficiency in E. coli is suppressed by additional determinants from its par operon: ParB, which can be supplied in trans, and its target, the par operon promoter, required in cis to ori V-rep. We propose that ParB binding to its target either changes plasmid DNA and thus promoter conformation or by spreading or looping contacts RNAP at the rep promoter so that rep expression is sufficient to activate ori V.",M1
15948945,"Spatial arrangement and macrodomain organization of bacterial chromosomes.Recent developments in fluorescence microscopy have shown that bacterial chromosomes have a defined spatial arrangement that preserves the linear order of genes on the genetic map. These approaches also revealed that large portions of the chromosome in Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis are concentrated in the same cellular space, suggesting an organization as large regions defined as macrodomains. In E. coli, two macrodomains of 1 Mb containing the replication origin (<e>Ori</e>) and the replication terminus (Ter) have been shown to relocalize at specific steps of the cell cycle. A genetic analysis of the collision probability between distant DNA sites in E. coli has confirmed the presence of macrodomains by revealing the existence of large regions that do not collide with each other. Two macrodomains defined by the genetic approach coincide with the Ori and Ter macrodomains, and two new macrodomains flanking the Ter macrodomain have been identified. Altogether, these results indicate that the E. coli chromosome has a ring organization with four structured and two less-structured regions. Implications for chromosome dynamics during the cell cycle and future prospects for the characterization and understanding of macrodomain organization are discussed.",M1
15904920,"Promiscuous initiation on mammalian chromosomal DNA templates and its possible suppression by transcription.The Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) origin consists of many inefficient initiation sites scattered throughout a 55-kb intergenic spacer, with the <e>ori</e>-beta, ori-beta', and ori-gamma subregions being preferred. To test for the presence of genetic replicators within these subregions, fragments containing ori-beta, ori-beta', or, as a negative control, a fragment from the DHFR gene that never initiates in loco were placed at ectopic chromosomal positions. Two-dimensional gel analysis demonstrates that initiation occurs in all three fragments, including the fragment from the gene, and appears to occur at different positions within each fragment in different cells in the population. However, initiation is not detectable in the adjacent, transcribed, neomycin-resistance marker. When a cosmid containing an active DHFR gene was inserted into an ectopic chromosomal site, initiation could no longer be observed in the body of the gene, but was clearly evident in the transcriptionally-silent bacterial vector sequences. In the thirteen independent chromosomal positions into which the four different constructs were inserted, initiation occurred in early S-phase. Since these loci necessarily had to be permissive for transcription of the neo(r) marker or DHFR gene used to select transfectants, it is possible that early-firing origin activity and local transcription are somehow linked. In total, these data suggest that potential initiation sites are distributed at very frequent intervals in the mammalian genome, with usage being regulated both positively and negatively by local transcription.",M1
15901701,"Role of pi dimers in coupling ( handcuffing ) of plasmid R6K's gamma <e>ori</e> iterons.One proposed mechanism of replication inhibition in iteron-containing plasmids (ICPs) is  handcuffing,  in which the coupling of origins via iteron-bound replication initiator (Rep) protein turns off origin function. In minimal R6K replicons, copy number control requires the interaction of plasmid-encoded pi protein with the seven 22-bp iterons of the gamma origin of replication. Like other related Rep proteins, pi exists as both monomers and dimers. However, the ability of pi dimers to bind iterons distinguishes R6K from most other ICPs, where only monomers have been observed to bind iterons. Here, we describe experiments to determine if monomers or dimers of pi protein are involved in the formation of handcuffed complexes. Standard ligation enhancement assays were done using pi variants with different propensities to bind iterons as monomers or dimers. Consistent with observations from several ICPs, a hyperreplicative variant (pi.P106L(wedge)F107S) exhibits deficiencies in handcuffing. Additionally, a novel dimer-biased variant of pi protein (pi.M36A(wedge)M38A), which lacks initiator function, handcuffs iteron-containing DNA more efficiently than does wild-type pi. The data suggest that pi dimers mediate handcuffing, supporting our previously proposed model of handcuffing in the gamma ori system. Thus, dimers of pi appear to possess three distinct inhibitory functions with respect to R6K replication: transcriptional autorepression of pi expression, in cis competition (for origin binding) with monomeric activator pi, and handcuffing-mediated inhibition of replication in trans.",M1
15879555,"Specific signals at the 3' end of the DHFR gene define one boundary of the downstream origin of replication.The Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) origin of replication consists of a 55-kb zone of potential initiation sites lying between the convergently transcribed DHFR and 2BE2121 genes. Two subregions within this zone (<e>ori</e>-beta/ori-beta' and ori-gamma) are preferred. In the DHFR-deficient variant, DR8, which has deleted a 14-kb sequence straddling the 3' end of the DHFR gene, early-firing origin activity in the downstream ori-beta/ori-beta' and ori-gamma regions is completely suppressed. We show that the critical deleted sequences reside within a 168-bp segment encompassing the intron 5/exon 6 boundary, exon 6, 54 bp of the 3' untranslated region (UTR), but not the three natural polyA sites. In wild-type cells, this sequence efficiently arrests transcription in a region a few kilobases downstream, which coincides with the 5' boundary of the replication initiation zone. In DR8, DHFR-specific transcripts efficiently use an alternative sixth exon (6c) and polyA signals near the middle of the former intergenic region to process primary transcripts. However, transcription proceeds to a position almost 35 kb downstream from these signals, and replication initiation can only be detected beyond this point. When the wild-type 168-bp 3' element is inserted into DR8 at the same position as alternative exon 6c, transcription is arrested efficiently and initiations occur almost immediately downstream. Thus, the normal 3' end of the DHFR gene constitutes a boundary element not only for the gene but also for the local origin of replication.",M1
15758215,"Functional analysis and annotation of the virulence plasmid pMUM001 from Mycobacterium ulcerans.The presence of a 174 kb plasmid called pMUM001 in Mycobacterium ulcerans, the first example of a mycobacterial plasmid encoding a virulence determinant, was recently reported. Over half of pMUM001 is devoted to six genes, three of which encode giant polyketide synthases (PKS) that produce mycolactone, an unusual cytotoxic lipid produced by M. ulcerans. In this present study the remaining 75 non-PKS-associated protein-coding sequences (CDS) are analysed and it is shown that pMUM001 is a low-copy-number element with a functional <e>ori</e> that supports replication in Mycobacterium marinum but not in the fast-growing mycobacteria Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium fortuitum. Sequence analyses revealed a highly mosaic plasmid gene structure that is reminiscent of other large plasmids. Insertion sequences (IS) and fragments of IS, some previously unreported, are interspersed among functional gene clusters, such as those genes involved in plasmid replication, the synthesis of mycolactone, and a potential phosphorelay signal transduction system. Among the IS present on pMUM001 were multiple copies of the high-copy-number M. ulcerans elements IS2404 and IS2606. No plasmid transfer systems were identified, suggesting that trans-acting factors are required for mobilization. The results presented here provide important insights into this unusual virulence plasmid from an emerging but neglected human pathogen.",M1
15746324,"Characterization of the cro-<e>ori</e> region of the Streptococcus thermophilus virulent bacteriophage DT1.The virulent cos-type Streptococcus thermophilus phage DT1 was previously isolated from a mozzarella whey sample, and its complete genomic sequence is available. The putative ori of phage DT1 is characterized by three inverted and two direct repeats located in a noncoding region between orf36 and orf37. As the replication ability of the putative ori and flanking genes could not be established, its ability to confer phage resistance was tested. When ori is cloned on a high-copy-number plasmid, it provides protection to S. thermophilus strains against phage infection during milk fermentation. This protection is phage specific and strain dependent. Then, a detailed transcriptional map was established for the region located between the cro-like gene (orf29) and the ori. The results of the Northern blots indicated that the transcription of this region started 5 min after the onset of phage infection. Comparative analysis of the expression of the cro-ori region in the three S. thermophilus cos-type phages DT1, Sfi19 (virulent), and Sfi21 (temperate) reveals significant differences in the number and size of transcripts. The promoter upstream of orf29 was further investigated by primer extension analysis, and its activity was confirmed by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, which showed that the phage promoter is more efficient than the constitutive bacterial promoter of the S. thermophilus operon encoding the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. However, the phage promoter is less efficient than the pts promoter in Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli.",M1

15564457,"Lytic cycle gene regulation of Epstein-Barr virus.Episomal reporter plasmids containing the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) oriP sequence stably transfected into Akata Burkitt's lymphoma cells were used to analyze EBV lytic cycle gene regulation. First, we found that the Zp promoter of EBV, but not the Rp promoter, can be activated in the absence of protein synthesis in these oriP plasmids, casting doubt on the immediate early status of Rp. An additional level of regulation of Zp was implied by analysis of a mutation of the ZV element. Second, our analysis of late lytic cycle promoters revealed that the correct relative timing, dependence on <e>ori</e> lyt in cis, and sensitivity to inhibitors of DNA replication were reconstituted on the oriP plasmids. Late promoter luciferase activity from oriP plasmids also incorporating replication-competent ori lyt was phosphonoacetic acid sensitive, a hallmark of EBV late genes. A minimal ori lyt, which only replicates weakly, was sufficient to confer late timing of expression specifically on late promoters. Finally, deletion analysis of EBV late promoter sequences upstream of the transcription start site confirmed that sequences between -49 and +30 are sufficient for late gene expression, which is dependent on ori lyt in cis. However, the TATT version of the TATA box found in many late genes was not essential for late expression.",M1
15556290,"Bacterial expression system with tightly regulated gene expression and plasmid copy number.A new Escherichia coli host/vector system has been engineered to allow tight and uniform modulation of gene expression and gamma origin (<e>ori</e>) plasmid copy number. Regulation of gamma ori plasmid copy number is achieved through arabinose-inducible expression of the necessary Rep protein, pi, whose gene was integrated into the chromosome of the host strain under control of the P(BAD) promoter. gamma ori replication can be uniformly modulated over 100-fold by changing the concentration of l-arabinose in the growth medium. This strain avoids the problem of all-or-nothing induction of P(BAD) because it is deficient in both arabinose uptake and degradation genes. Arabinose enters the cell by a mutant LacY transporter, LacYA177C, which is expressed from the host chromosome. Although this strain could be compatible with any gamma ori plasmid, we describe the utility of a gamma ori expression vector that allows especially tight regulation of gene expression. With this host/vector system, it is possible to independently modulate gene expression and gene dosage, facilitating the cloning and overproduction of toxic gene products. We describe the successful use of this system for cloning a highly potent toxin, Colicin E3, in the absence of its cognate immunity protein. This system could be useful for cloning genes encoding other potent toxins, screening libraries for potential toxins, and maintaining any gamma ori vector at precise copy levels in a cell.",M1
15493011,"Initiation of DNA replication at a nuclear matrix-attached chromatin fraction.It is still unclear what nuclear components support initiation of DNA replication. To address this issue, we developed a cell-free replication system in which the nuclear matrix along with the residual matrix-attached chromatin was used as a substrate for DNA replication. We found out that initiation occurred at late G1 residual chromatin but not at early G1 chromatin and depended on cytosolic and nuclear factors present in S phase cells but not in G1 cells. Initiation of DNA replication occurred at discrete replication foci in a pattern typical for early S phase. To prove that the observed initiation takes place at legitimate DNA replication origins, the in vitro synthesized nascent DNA strands were isolated and analyzed. It was shown that they were enriched in sequences from the core origin region of the early firing, dihydrofolate reductase origin of replication <e>ori</e>-beta and not in distal to the origin sequences. A conclusion is drawn that initiation of DNA replication occurs at discrete sub-chromosomal structures attached to the nuclear matrix.",M1
15280471,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus <e>ori</e>-Lyt-dependent DNA replication: cis-acting requirements for replication and ori-Lyt-associated RNA transcription.Herpesvirus lytic DNA replication requires both the cis-acting element, the origin, and trans-acting factors such as virally encoded origin-binding protein and DNA replication enzymes. Recently, the origins of lytic DNA replication (ori-Lyt) in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) have been identified and a virally encoded bZip protein, K8, has been shown to specifically bind to the origin. To map cis-acting elements within KSHV ori-Lyt that are required for DNA replication function and to define the nature of K8 bZip protein binding to the origin, we constructed consecutive internal deletion mutations across the core domain of a KSHV ori-Lyt and tested them for DNA replication function in a transient replication assay. This mutagenesis study allowed the identification of four components within the ori-Lyt, and all were indispensable for ori-Lyt function. The first component contains eight CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) binding motifs that organize as four spaced C/EBP palindromes. Each palindrome contains two head-to-head CCAAT consensus motifs that are separated by a 13- or 12-bp space sequence. Substitution mutagenesis of these C/EBP motifs showed that these C/EBP palindromes are required for both K8 binding and ori-Lyt-dependent DNA replication. The second component is an 18-bp AT palindrome, which is essential for ori-Lyt function. The third component was determined to be a 32-bp previously unidentified sequence and is required for DNA replication. The last component consists of an open reading frame 50 (ORF50)/Rta responsive element (RRE) and a TATA box. We showed that the binding of an ORF50/Rta protein to the RRE was essential for ori-Lyt-dependent DNA replication. The presence of a functional RRE and a downstream TATA box suggested that this region serves as an ORF50/Rta-dependent promoter and a transcription event may be necessary for ori-Lyt-dependent DNA replication. Using a luciferase reporter system, we demonstrated that the region of the RRE and TATA box constitutes an ORF50/Rta-dependent promoter. Furthermore, a polyadenylated RNA of 1.4 kb was identified downstream of the promoter.",M1
15247259,"Binding modes of the initiator and inhibitor forms of the replication protein pi to the gamma <e>ori</e> iteron of plasmid R6K.Discerning the interactions between initiator protein and the origin of replication should provide insights into the mechanism of DNA replication initiation. In the gamma origin of plasmid R6K, the Rep protein, pi, is distinctive in that it can bind the seven 22-bp iterons in two forms; pi monomers activate replication, whereas pi dimers act as inhibitors. In this work, we used wild type and variants of the pi protein with altered monomer/dimer ratios to study iteron/pi interactions. High resolution contact mapping was conducted using multiple techniques (missing base contact probing, methylation protection, base modification, and hydroxyl radical footprinting), and the electrophoretic separation of nucleoprotein complexes allowed us to discriminate between contact patterns produced by pi monomers and dimers. We also isolated iteron mutants that affected the binding of pi monomers (only) or both monomers and dimers. The mutational studies and footprinting analyses revealed that, when binding DNA, pi monomers interact with nucleotides spanning the entire length of the iteron. In contrast, pi dimers interact with only the left half of the iteron; however, the retained interactions are strikingly similar to those seen with monomers. These results support a model in which Rep protein dimerization disturbs one of two DNA binding domains important for monomer/iteron interaction; the dimer/iteron interaction utilizes only one DNA binding domain.",M1

In this study, an in vivo excision and amplification system in human BJAB cells was devised by combining the Cre/loxP system of bacteriophage P1 and the large T antigen/SV40 ori system of Simian virus 40. Two loxP sequences, each of which serves as a recognition site for recombinase Cre, were integrated unidirectionally into 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the human iNOS. An SV40 ori sequence, which serves as a conditional replication system, was inserted between the loxP sites. Trans-acting genes cre and large T antigen, which were under the control of a tetracycline responsive promoter, were also inserted into the 5'- and 3'-UTRs of the iNOS, respectively, by homologous recombination. Upon induction by doxycycline, the 45-kb iNOS genomic fragment of human chromosome 17 flanked by two loxP sites was excised and amplified up to about 45 copies per cell. Our method is very useful for obtaining large genomic fragments in quantities directly from human cells without using foreign hosts. Therefore, our approach can be used effectively for gap sequencing of a genome, gene therapy, and functional analysis of unknown genes in human cells.",M1
15121836,"Defined sequence modules and an architectural element cooperate to promote initiation at an ectopic mammalian chromosomal replication origin.A small DNA fragment containing the high-frequency initiation region (IR) <e>ori</e>-beta from the hamster dihydrofolate reductase locus functions as an independent replicator in ectopic locations in both hamster and human cells. Conversely, a fragment of the human lamin B2 locus containing the previously mapped IR serves as an independent replicator at ectopic chromosomal sites in hamster cells. At least four defined sequence elements are specifically required for full activity of ectopic ori-beta in hamster cells. These include an AT-rich element, a 4-bp sequence located within the mapped IR, a region of intrinsically bent DNA located between these two elements, and a RIP60 protein binding site adjacent to the bent region. The ori-beta AT-rich element is critical for initiation activity in human, as well as hamster, cells and can be functionally substituted for by an AT-rich region from the human lamin B2 IR that differs in nucleotide sequence and length. Taken together, the results demonstrate that two mammalian replicators can be activated at ectopic sites in chromosomes of another mammal and lead us to speculate that they may share functionally related elements.",M1
15105447,"Heterochromatin on the inactive X chromosome delays replication timing without affecting origin usage.DNA replication origins (<e>ORIs</e>) map close to promoter regions in many organisms, including mammals. However, the relationship between initiation of replication and transcription is not well understood. To address this issue, we have analyzed replication timing and activity of several CpG island-associated ORIs on the transcriptionally active and silent X chromosomes. We find equivalent ORI usage and efficiency of both alleles at sites that are replicated late on the inactive X chromosome. Thus, in contrast to its repressive effect on transcription, heterochromatin does not influence ORI activity. These findings suggest that the relationship between sites of transcription and replication initiation at CpG island regions is restricted to early development, and that subsequent gene silencing and heterochromatin formation influence only the timing of ORI activation.",M1
15105371,"Sequence requirements for function of the Drosophila chorion gene locus ACE3 replicator and <e>ori</e>-beta origin elements.The developmentally regulated amplification of the Drosophila third chromosome chorion gene locus requires multiple chromosomal elements. Amplification control element third chromosome (ACE3) appears to function as a replicator, in that it is required in cis for the activity of nearby DNA replication origin(s). Ori-beta is the major origin in the locus, and is a sequence-specific element that is sufficient for high-level amplification in combination with ACE3. Sequence requirements for amplification were examined using a transgenic construct that was buffered from chromosomal position effects by flanking insulator elements. The parent construct supported 18- to 20-fold amplification, and contained the 320 bp ACE3, the approximately 1.2 kb S18 chorion gene and the 840 bp ori-beta. Deletion mapping of ACE3 revealed that an evolutionarily conserved 142 bp core sequence functions in amplification in this context. Several deletions had quantitative effects, suggesting that multiple, partially redundant elements comprise ACE3. S. cerevisiae ARS1 origin sequences could not substitute for ori-beta, thereby confirming the sequence specificity of ori-beta. Deletion mapping of ori-beta identified two required components: a 140 bp 5' element and a 226 bp A/T-rich 3' element called the beta-region that has significant homology to ACE3. Antibody to the origin recognition complex subunit 2 (ORC2) recognizes large foci that localize to the endogenous chorion gene loci and to active transgenic constructs at the beginning of amplification. Mutations in Orc2 itself, or the amplification trans regulator satin eliminated the ORC2 foci. By contrast, with a null mutation of chiffon (dbf4-like) that eliminates amplification, diffuse ORC2 staining was still present, but failed to localize into foci. The data suggest a novel function for the Dbf4-like chiffon protein in ORC localization. Chromosomal position effects that eliminated amplification of transgenic constructs also eliminated foci formation. However, use of the buffered vector allowed amplification of transgenic constructs to occur in the absence of detectable foci formation. Taken together, the data suggest a model in which ACE3 and ori-beta nucleate the formation of a ORC2-containing chromatin structure that spreads along the chromosome in a mechanism dependent upon chiffon.",M1
15047840,"Detection of template strand switching during initiation and termination of DNA replication of porcine circovirus.Nucleotide substitution mutagenesis was conducted to investigate the importance of the inverted repeats (palindrome) at the origin of DNA replication (<e>Ori</e>) of porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1). Viral genomes with engineered mutations on either arm or both arms of the palindrome were not impaired in protein synthesis and yielded infectious progeny viruses with restored or new palindromes. Thus, a flanking palindrome at the Ori was not essential for initiation of DNA replication, but one was generated inevitably at termination. Among the 26 viruses recovered, 16 showed evidence of template strand switching, from minus-strand genome DNA to palindromic strand DNA, during biosynthesis of the Ori. Here I propose a novel rolling-circle  melting-pot  model for PCV1 DNA replication. In this model, the replicator Rep protein complex binds, destabilizes, and nicks the Ori sequence to initiate leading-strand DNA synthesis. All four strands of the destabilized inverted repeats exist in a  melted  configuration, and the minus-strand viral genome and a palindromic strand are available as templates, simultaneously, during initiation or termination of DNA replication. Inherent in this model is a  gene correction  or  terminal repeat correction  mechanism that can restore mutilated inverted-repeat sequences to a palindrome at the Ori of circular DNAs or at the termini of circularized linear DNAs. Potentially, the melted state of the inverted repeats increases the rate of noncomplementary or illegitimate nucleotide incorporation into the palindrome. Thus, this melting-pot model provides insight into the mechanisms of DNA replication, gene correction, and illegitimate recombination at the Ori of PCV1, and it may be applicable to the replication of other circular DNA molecules.",M1
14973139,"Reconstitution of F factor DNA replication in vitro with purified proteins.Jacob, Brenner, and Cuzin pioneered the development of the F plasmid as a model system to study replication control, and these investigations led to the development of the  replicon model  (Jacob, F., Brenner, S., and Cuzin, F. (1964) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 28, 329-348). To elucidate further the mechanism of initiation of replication of this plasmid and its control, we have reconstituted its replication in vitro with 21 purified host-encoded proteins and the plasmid-encoded initiator RepE. The replication in vitro was specifically initiated at the F <e>ori</e> (oriV) and required both the bacterial initiator protein DnaA and the plasmid-encoded initiator RepE. The wild type dimeric RepE was inactive in catalyzing replication, whereas a monomeric mutant form called RepE(*) (R118P) was capable of catalyzing vigorous replication. The replication topology was mostly of the Cairns form, and the fork movement was unidirectional and mostly from right to left. The replication was dependent on the HU protein, and the structurally and functionally related DNA bending protein IHF could not efficiently substitute for HU. The priming was dependent on DnaG primase. Many of the characteristics of the in vitro replication closely mimicked those of in vivo replication. We believe that the in vitro system should be very useful in unraveling the mechanism of replication initiation and its control.",M1
14726243,"Cell line-specific accumulation of the baculovirus non-hr origin of DNA replication in infected insect cells.Successive viral passage of Spodoptera exigua multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) in the S. exigua cell line Se301 leads to the rapid accumulation of the non-hr origin of DNA replication (<e>ori</e>) as large concatemers. Passage of SeMNPV in two other S. exigua cell lines, SeUCR1 and SeIZD2109, did not show the accumulation of such concatemers. When introduced into SeUCR1 and SeIZD2109 cells, the non-hr ori concatemers generated in Se301 cells were maintained but did not increase. This suggests that the non-hr ori confers a strong selective advantage in Se301 cells, but not or to a lesser extent in the other cell lines. The cell line-specific accumulation of non-hr ori concatemers might be due to a higher intrinsic recombination frequency in Se301 cells and may reflect tissue related differences involving some host cell factor(s). Since non-hr ori concatemers in Se301 cells were more abundant in intracellular than in extracellular viral DNA preparations, episomal replication and the requirement of a minimal DNA size for packaging into nucleocapsids is hypothesized.",M1
14712068,"When pol I goes into high gear: processive DNA synthesis by pol I in the cell.Pol I is the most abundant polymerase in E. coli and plays an important role in short patch repair. In accord with this role in the cell, the purified polymerase exhibits low processivity and high fidelity in vitro. Pol I is also the polymerase responsible for leader strand synthesis during ColE1 plasmid replication. In a previous publication, we described the generation of a highly error-prone DNA polymerase I. Expression of this mutant Pol I results in errors during the replication of a ColE1 plasmid. The distribution and spectrum of mutations in the ColE1 plasmid sequence downstream the <e>ori</e> indicates that Pol I is capable of more processive replication in vivo than previously accepted. Here, we review evidence suggesting that Pol I may be recruited into a replisome-like holoenzyme and speculate that processive DNA replication by Pol I may play a role in recombination-dependent DNA replication in the cell.",M1
14685268,"migS, a cis-acting site that affects bipolar positioning of oriC on the Escherichia coli chromosome.During replication of the Escherichia coli chromosome, the replicated <e>Ori</e> domains migrate towards opposite cell poles, suggesting that a cis-acting site for bipolar migration is located in this region. To identify this cis-acting site, a series of mutants was constructed by splitting subchromosomes from the original chromosome. One mutant, containing a 720 kb subchromosome, was found to be defective in the bipolar positioning of oriC. The creation of deletion mutants allowed the identification of migS, a 25 bp sequence, as the cis-acting site for the bipolar positioning of oriC. When migS was located at the replication terminus, the chromosomal segment showed bipolar positioning. migS was able to rescue bipolar migration of plasmid DNA containing a mutation in the SopABC partitioning system. Interestingly, multiple copies of the migS sequence on a plasmid in trans inhibited the bipolar positioning of oriC. Taken together, these findings indicate that migS plays a crucial role in the bipolar positioning of oriC. In addition, real-time analysis of the dynamic morphological changes of nucleoids in wild-type and migS mutants suggests that bipolar positioning of the replicated oriC contributes to nucleoid organization.",M1
14602914,"Bidirectional replication from an internal <e>ori</e> site of the linear N15 plasmid prophage.The prophage of coliphage N15 is not integrated into the chromosome but exists as a linear plasmid molecule with covalently closed hairpin ends (telomeres). Upon infection the injected phage DNA circularizes via its cohesive ends. Then, a phage-encoded enzyme, protelomerase, cuts the circle and forms the hairpin telomeres. N15 protelomerase acts as a telomere-resolving enzyme during prophage DNA replication. We characterized the N15 replicon and found that replication of circular N15 miniplasmids requires only the repA gene, which encodes a multidomain protein homologous to replication proteins of bacterial plasmids replicated by a theta-mechanism. Replication of a linear N15 miniplasmid also requires the protelomerase gene and telomere regions. N15 prophage replication is initiated at an internal ori site located within repA and proceeds bidirectionally. Electron microscopy data suggest that after duplication of the left telomere, protelomerase cuts this site generating Y-shaped molecules. Full replication of the molecule and subsequent resolution of the right telomere then results in two linear plasmid molecules. N15 prophage replication thus appears to follow a mechanism that is distinct from that employed by eukaryotic replicons with this type of telomere and suggests the possibility of evolutionarily independent appearances of prokaryotic and eukaryotic replicons with covalently closed telomeres.",M1
14597775,"A function for the mitochondrial chaperonin Hsp60 in the structure and transmission of mitochondrial DNA nucleoids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.The yeast mitochondrial chaperonin Hsp60 has previously been implicated in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transactions: it is found in mtDNA nucleoids associated with single-stranded DNA; it binds preferentially to the template strand of active mtDNA <e>ori</e> sequences in vitro; and wild-type (rho+) mtDNA is unstable in hsp60 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants grown at the permissive temperature. Here we show that the mtDNA instability is caused by a defect in mtDNA transmission to daughter cells. Using high resolution, fluorescence deconvolution microscopy, we observe a striking alteration in the morphology of mtDNA nucleoids in rho+ cells of an hsp60-ts mutant that suggests a defect in nucleoid division. We show that rho- petite mtDNA consisting of active ori repeats is uniquely unstable in the hsp60-ts mutant. This instability of ori rho- mtDNA requires transcription from the canonical promoter within the ori element. Our data suggest that the nucleoid dynamics underlying mtDNA transmission are regulated by the interaction between Hsp60 and mtDNA ori sequences.",M1
14530447,"pi protein- and ATP-dependent transitions from 'closed' to 'open' complexes at the gamma <e>ori</e> of plasmid R6K.R6K-encoded pi protein can bind to the seven, 22 bp tandem iterons of the gamma origin. In this work, we use a variant of pi, His-pi.F107S, that is hyperactive in replication. In vitro, His-pi.F107S-dependent local DNA melting (open complex formation) occurs in the absence of host proteins (IHF/HU or DnaA) and it is positioned in the A + T-rich region adjacent to iterons. Experiments described here examine the effects of ATP, Mg2+ and temperature on the opening reaction. We show that the opening of the gamma origin can occur in the presence of ATP as well as AMP-PCP (a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog). This suggests that, for gamma origin, ATP hydrolysis may be unnecessary for open complex formation facilitated by His-pi.F107S. In the absence of ATP or Mg2+, His-pi.F107S yielded data suggestive of distortions in the iteron attributable to DNA bending rather than DNA melting. Our findings also demonstrate that ATP and pi stimulate open complex formation over a wide range of temperatures, but not at 0 degrees C. These and other results indicate that ATP and/or Mg2+ are not needed for His-pi.F107S binding to iterons and that ATP effects an allosteric change in the protein bound to gamma origin.",M1
13679600,"Spontaneous excision of BAC vector sequences from bacmid-derived baculovirus expression vectors upon passage in insect cells.Repeated baculovirus infections in cultured insect cells lead to the generation of defective interfering viruses (DIs), which accumulate at the expense of the intact helper virus and compromise heterologous protein expression. In particular, Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedovirus (AcMNPV) DIs are enriched in an origin of viral DNA replication (<e>ori</e>) not associated with the homologous regions (hrs). This non-hr ori is located within the coding sequence of the non-essential p94 gene. We investigated the effect of a deletion of the AcMNPV non-hr ori on the heterologous protein expression levels following serial passage in Sf21 insect cells. Using homologous ET recombination in E. coli, deletions within the p94 gene were made in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the entire AcMNPV genome (bacmid). All bacmids were equipped with an expression cassette containing the green fluorescent protein gene and a gene encoding the classical swine fever virus E2 glycoprotein (CSFV-E2). For the parental (intact) bacmid only, a strong accumulation of DIs with reiterated non-hr oris was observed. This was not observed for the mutants, indicating that removal of the non-hr ori enhanced the genetic stability of the viral genome upon passaging. However, for all passaged viruses it was found that the entire BAC vector including the expression cassette was spontaneously deleted from the viral genome, leading to a rapid decrease in GFP and CSFV-E2 production. The rationale for the (intrinsic) genetic instability of the BAC vector in insect cells and the implications with respect to large-scale production of proteins with bacmid-derived baculoviruses are discussed.",M1
12860398,"Interaction of EBV latent origin of replication with the nuclear matrix: identification of S/MAR sequences and protein components.During latency, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) genome, as an episome, is attached to the nuclear matrix (NM) via the latent origin of replication <e>ori</e> P. Within this element, we have found that a region, 580 bp long, encompassing the replicator DS element, shows the strongest affinity for the NM. In addition, by cross-linking with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, we have identified two NM proteins with an apparent molecular weight of 85 and 60 kDa that, with high affinity and specificity, bind ori P. These proteins are not induced by EBV infection, but their interaction with ori P is lost upon induction of EBV lytic cycle. These data strongly suggest that the binding of ori P to specific components of the NM is required for EBV latent replication.",M1
12853603,"Replication of damaged DNA in vitro is blocked by p53.The tumor suppressor protein p53 may have other roles and functions in addition to its well-documented ability to serve as a sequence-specific transcriptional activator in response to DNA damage. We showed previously that p53 can block the replication of polyomavirus origin-containing DNA (Py <e>ori</e>-DNA) in vitro when p53 binding sites are present on the late side of the Py ori. Here we have both further extended these observations and have also examined whether p53 might be able to bind directly to and inhibit the replication of damaged DNA. We found that p53 strongly inhibits replication of gamma-irradiated Py ori-DNA and such inhibition requires both the central DNA binding domain and the extreme C-terminus of the p53 protein. An endogenous p53 binding site lies within the Py origin and is required for the ability of p53 to block initiation of replication from gamma-irradiated Py ori-DNA, suggesting the possibility of DNA looping caused by p53 binding both non-specifically to sites of DNA damage and specifically to the endogenous site in the polyomavirus origin. Our results thus suggest the possibility that under some circumstances p53 might serve as a direct regulator of DNA replication and suggest as well an additional function for cooperation between its two autonomous DNA binding domains.",M1
12732098,"Wavelet to predict bacterial <e>ori</e> and ter: a tendency towards a physical balance.BACKGROUND: Chromosomal DNA replication in bacteria starts at the origin (ori) and the two replicores propagate in opposite directions up to the terminus (ter) region. We hypothesize that the two replicores need to reach ter at the same time to maintain a physical balance; DNA insertion would disrupt such a balance, requiring chromosomal rearrangements to restore the balance. To test this hypothesis, we needed to demonstrate that ori and ter are in a physical balance in bacterial chromosomes. Using wavelet analysis, we documented GC skew, AT skew, purine excess and keto excess on the published bacterial genomic sequences to locate the turning (minimum and maximum) points on the curves. Previously, the minimum point had been supposed to correlate with ori and the maximum to correlate with ter. RESULTS: We observed a strong tendency of the bacterial chromosomes towards a physical balance, with the minima and maxima corresponding to the known or putative ori and ter and being about half chromosome separated in most of the bacteria studied. A nonparametric method based on wavelet transformation was employed to perform significance tests for the predicted loci. CONCLUSIONS: The wavelet approach can reliably predict the ori and ter regions and the bacterial chromosomes have a strong tendency towards a physical balance between ori and ter.",M1
12719550,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus lytic origin (<e>ori</e>-Lyt)-dependent DNA replication: identification of the ori-Lyt and association of K8 bZip protein with the origin.Herpesviruses utilize different origins of replication during lytic versus latent infection. Latent DNA replication depends on host cellular DNA replication machinery, whereas lytic cycle DNA replication requires virally encoded replication proteins. In lytic DNA replication, the lytic origin (ori-Lyt) is bound by a virus-specified origin binding protein (OBP) that recruits the core replication machinery. In this report, we demonstrated that DNA sequences in two noncoding regions of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) genome, between open reading frames (ORFs) K4.2 and K5 and between K12 and ORF71, are able to serve as origins for lytic cycle-specific DNA replication. The two ori-Lyt domains share an almost identical 1,153-bp sequence and a 600-bp downstream GC-rich repeat sequence, and the 1.7-kb DNA sequences are sufficient to act as a cis signal for replication. We also showed that an AT-palindromic sequence in the ori-Lyt domain is essential for the DNA replication. In addition, a virally encoded bZip protein, namely K8, was found to bind to a DNA sequence within the ori-Lyt by using a DNA binding site selection assay. The binding of K8 to this region was confirmed in cells by using a chromatin immunoprecipitation method. Further analysis revealed that K8 binds to an extended region, and the entire region is 100% conserved between two KSHV ori-Lyt's. K8 protein displays significant similarity to the Zta protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is a known OBP of EBV. This notion, together with the ability of K8 to bind to the KSHV ori-Lyt, suggests that K8 may function as an OBP in KSHV.",M1
12682354,"Differential use of multiple replication origins in the ribosomal DNA episome of the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.The factors that control the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication from defined origins (<e>oris</e>) on the chromosome remain incompletely resolved. Here we show that the circular rDNA episome of the human pathogen Entamoeba histolytica contains multiple potential oris, which are utilized in a differential manner. The primary ori in exponentially growing cells was mapped close to the promoter of rRNA genes in the upstream intergenic spacer (IGS) by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Replication initiated predominantly from the upstream IGS and terminated in the downstream IGS. However, when serum-starved cells were allowed to resume growth, the early oris which became activated were located in other parts of the molecule. Later the ori in the upstream IGS became activated, with concomitant silencing of the early oris. When the upstream IGS was located ectopically in an artificial plasmid, it again lost ori activity, while other parts of the rDNA episome could function as oris in this system. Therefore, the activation or silencing of the ori in this episome is context dependent, as is also the case with many eukaryotic replicons. This is the first replication origin to be mapped in this primitive protozoan and will provide an opportunity to define the factors involved in differential ori activity, and their comparison with metazoans.",M1
12644491,"Interaction of the initiator protein of an IncB plasmid with its origin of DNA replication.The replication initiator protein RepA of the IncB plasmid pMU720 was purified and used in DNase I protection assays in vitro. RepA protected a 68-bp region of the origin of replication of pMU720. This region, which lies immediately downstream of the DnaA box, contains four copies of the sequence motif 5'AANCNGCAA3'. Mutational analyses identified this sequence as the binding site specifically recognized by RepA (the RepA box). Binding of RepA to the RepA boxes was ordered and sequential, with the box closest to the DnaA binding site (box 1) occupied first and the most distant boxes (boxes 3 and 4) occupied last. However, only boxes 1, 2, and 4 were essential for origin activity, with box 3 playing a lesser role. Changing the spacing between box 1 and the other three boxes affected binding of RepA in vitro and origin activity in vivo, indicating that the RepA molecules bound to <e>ori</e>(B) interact with one another.",M1
12529386,"The dihydrofolate reductase origin of replication does not contain any nonredundant genetic elements required for origin activity.The Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) origin of replication consists of a broad zone of potential initiation sites scattered throughout a 55-kb intergenic spacer, with at least three sites being preferred (<e>ori</e>-beta, ori-beta', and ori-gamma). We previously showed that deletion of the most active site or region (ori-beta) has no demonstrable effect on initiation in the remainder of the intergenic spacer nor on the time of replication of the DHFR locus as a whole. In the present study, we have now deleted ori-beta', both ori-beta and ori-beta', an 11-kb region just downstream from the DHFR gene, or the central approximately 40-kb core of the spacer. The latter two deletions together encompass &gt;95% of the initiation sites that are normally used in this locus. Two-dimensional gel analysis shows that initiation still occurs in the early S phase in the remainder of the intergenic spacer in each of these deletion variants. Even removal of the 40-kb core fails to elicit a significant effect on the time of replication of the DHFR locus in the S period; indeed, in the truncated spacer that remains, the efficiency of initiation actually appears to increase relative to the corresponding region in the wild-type locus. Thus, if replicators control the positions of nascent strand start sites in this complex origin, either (i) there must be a very large number of redundant elements in the spacer, each of which regulates initiation only in its immediate environment, or (ii) they must lie outside the central core in which the vast majority of nascent strand starts occur.",M1
12490953,"Role for a Drosophila Myb-containing protein complex in site-specific DNA replication.There is considerable interest in the developmental, temporal and tissue-specific patterns of DNA replication in metazoans. Site-specific DNA replication at the chorion loci in Drosophila follicle cells leads to extensive gene amplification, and the organization of the cis-acting DNA elements that regulate this process may provide a model for how such regulation is achieved. Two elements important for amplification of the third chromosome chorion gene cluster, ACE3 and <e>Ori</e>-beta, are directly bound by Orc (origin recognition complex), and two-dimensional gel analysis has revealed that the primary origin used is Ori-beta (refs 7-9). Here we show that the Drosophila homologue of the Myb (Myeloblastosis) oncoprotein family is tightly associated with four additional proteins, and that the complex binds site-specifically to these regulatory DNA elements. Drosophila Myb is required in trans for gene amplification, showing that a Myb protein is directly involved in DNA replication. A Drosophila Myb binding site, as well as the binding site for another Myb complex member (p120), is necessary in cis for replication of reporter transgenes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments localize both proteins to the chorion loci in vivo. These data provide evidence that specific protein complexes bound to replication enhancer elements work together with the general replication machinery for site-specific origin utilization during replication.",M1
12474058,"A DNase I hypersensitive site flanks an origin of DNA replication and amplification in Sciara.In chromosomes of metazoa, the assembly of the genome into chromatin makes an important but poorly understood contribution to determining where DNA replication will initiate. We addressed this issue by studying the developmental progression of the location of the DNA replication origin (<e>ORI</e>) and alterations in chromatin structure in one of the best-mapped ORIs in metazoa, that found in DNA puff II/9A of the fly Sciara coprophila. We found that DNA synthesis for both normal chromosomal endoduplication and DNA amplification initiates within the same 5.5 kb EcoRI fragment. We showed that irrespective of the mode of ORI function--replication or amplification--chromatin over the 1 kb major ORI is never remodeled into a conventional DNase I hypersensitive site (DH site). Instead, we found that the major site of alterations to chromatin structure at this locus is a large (approximately 400 bp) DH site located 600 bp away from the major ORI, at a position where the frequency of replication initiation events falls dramatically. We describe a tight positive correlation between ORI activity, strength of this DH site, and the intranuclear titer of protein factor(s) that bind the DH site in a sequence-specific manner. We propose that the Sciara replicator in locus II/9A is composed of sequences that reside within the ORI per se as well as sequences encompassed by the DH site.",M1
12414923,"Inhibition of polyomavirus <e>ori</e>-dependent DNA replication by mSin3B.When tethered in cis to DNA, the transcriptional corepressor mSin3B inhibits polyomavirus (Py) ori-dependent DNA replication in vivo. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) appear not to be involved, since tethering class I and class II HDACs in cis does not inhibit replication and treating the cells with trichostatin A does not specifically relieve inhibition by mSin3B. However, the mSin3B L59P mutation that impairs mSin3B interaction with N-CoR/SMRT abrogates inhibition of replication, suggesting the involvement of N-CoR/SMRT. Py large T antigen interacts with mSin3B, suggesting an HDAC-independent mechanism by which mSin3B inhibits DNA replication.",M1
12388727,"The latency-associated nuclear antigen of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus supports latent DNA replication in dividing cells.Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. The latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is a multifunctional protein that is consistently expressed in all KSHV-associated malignancies. LANA interacts with a variety of cellular proteins, including the transcriptional cosuppressor complex mSin3 and the tumor suppressors p53 and Rb, thereby regulating viral and cellular gene expression. In addition, LANA is required for maintenance of the episomal viral DNA during latency in dividing cells. Colocalization studies suggest that LANA tethers the viral genome to chromosomes during mitosis. In support of this model, a specific LANA- binding site has recently been identified within the terminal repeat unit, and a chromatin interaction domain was mapped to a short amino acid stretch within the N-terminal domain of LANA. Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1), a functional homologue of LANA, is also required for genome segregation; in addition, EBNA-1 also supports efficient DNA replication of oriP-containing plasmids. By performing short-term replication assays, we demonstrate here for the first time that de novo synthesis of terminal-repeat (TR)-containing plasmids is highly dependent on the presence of LANA. We map the required cis-acting sequences within the TR to a 79-bp region and demonstrate that the DNA-binding domain of LANA is required for this DNA replication activity. Surprisingly, the 233-amino-acid C domain of LANA by itself partially supports replication. Our data show that LANA is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that, like EBNA-1, plays an important role in DNA replication and genome segregation. In addition, we show that all necessary cis elements for the origin of replication (<e>ori</e>) function are located within a single TR, suggesting that the putative ori of KSHV is different from those of other gammaherpesviruses, which all contain ori sequences within the unique long sequence outside of their TR. This notion is further strengthened by the unique modular structure of the KSHV TR element.",M1
12383083,"Functional analysis of plastid DNA replication origins in tobacco by targeted inactivation.Sequences described as chloroplast DNA replication origins were analysed in vivo by creating deletion and insertion mutants via plastid transformation in tobacco. Deletion of the described oriA sequence, which is located within the intron of the trnI gene, resulted in heteroplastomic transformants, when the selection marker was inserted within the intron. Removal of the complete intron sequence together with the oriA sequence, however, yielded homoplastomic transformants of normal phenotype, in which wild-type signals were no longer detectable through Southern analysis, thus bringing the role of the described oriA sequence for plastome replication into question. Similarly, deletion of sequence elements upstream of trnI, which have a possible <e>ori</e> function in Oenothera, did not show any effect in tobacco. The two copies of oriB, which are located at the very end of the plastome Inverted Repeats, were targeted with two different transformation vectors in a cotransformation approach. While in initial transformants integration of the selection marker could be detected at both sites, the transgene was found exclusively at one site or the other after additional rounds of regeneration. Whereas the copy of oriB in Inverted Repeat B could be completely deleted, targeting of the copy in Inverted Repeat A resulted in heteroplastomic lines, as the essential ycf1 gene was also affected. Due to the strong selection against cotransformants we conclude that at least one copy of the oriB sequence is essential for plastome replication, whereas replication appears possible without oriA elements.",M1
12225965,"Fish oil slows S phase progression and may cause upstream shift of DHFR replication origin <e>ori</e>-beta in CHO cells.Fish oils (FOs) have been noted to reduce growth and proliferation of certain tumor cells, effects usually attributed to the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-3 family, which are thought to modulate cellular signaling pathways. We investigated the influence of FO on cell cycle kinetics of cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. Exponentially growing cells were labeled with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and analyzed by flow cytometry after 5-day treatment with exogenous fat. Bivariate BrdU-DNA analysis indicated slower progression through S phase and thus longer S phase duration time in FO- but not corn oil-treated or control cells. We hypothesize that FO treatment might interfere with spatial/temporal organization of replication origins. Therefore, we mapped the well-characterized replication origin ori-beta downstream of the dihydrofolate reductase gene with the nascent strand length assay. Three DNA marker segments with known positions relative to this origin were amplified by PCR. By quantitatively assessing DNA length of the fragments in all fractions containing these markers, the location of ori-beta was established. In control or corn oil-treated cells, the location of ori-beta was consistent with previous studies. However, in FO-treated cells, DNA replication appears to start from a new site located farther upstream from ori-beta, suggesting a different replication initiation pattern. This study suggests novel mechanism(s) by which fats affect cell proliferation and DNA replication in mammalian cells.",M1
12124467,"The expansion of a hypervariable, non-hr <e>ori</e>-like region in the genome of Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus provides in vivo evidence for the utilization of baculovirus non-hr oris during replication.In this report a naturally occurring hypervariable region within the genome of different Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus genotypes is characterized. The region consists of a stretch of direct repeats, short palindromes and an unusual AT-rich region. Although the organization of these repeat sequences is unique to baculoviruses, it has the structural features of a 'non-hr' origin of DNA replication (ori). Restriction analysis and Southern hybridization revealed that this region is expanded during virus replication. Sequence comparison of different isolated genotypes indicated that the expansion is caused by concatenation of short repeats within the region or by concatenation of the complete region. These findings indicate that the expansion of non-hr origin-like regions is not restricted to defective-interfering particles, as was found previously for baculoviruses propagated in cell culture. Moreover, it appears that non-hr complexity contributes to the natural heterogeneity and genetic plasticity of baculovirus genomes. Also, circumstantial evidence is discussed that hr oris might have developed from internal rearrangement and multiplication of a non-hr ori during baculovirus evolution.",M1
12083331,"The UL9 <e>ori</e>-binding protein of herpes simplex virus 1: its expression and localization in vero cells.The ori-binding protein (OBP), an early protein which is encoded by the herpes simples virus 1 (HSV-1) UL9 gene and initiates the replication of viral DNA, was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified on an avidin resin and used for preparation of a mouse antiserum to OBP (OBP antiserum). Expression and localization of OBP in HSV-1-infected Vero cells was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and indirect immunofluorescence test. RT-PCR revealed the presence of abundant UL9 transcripts from 3 to 12 hrs post infection (p.i). Traces of UL9 mRNA were detected already at 1.5 hr p.i. The OBP antiserum detected clumps of irregularly shaped structures in the nuclei of infected Vero cells first at 4 hrs p.i. These nuclear structures peaked at 5-6 hrs p.i. and later on (at 8-12 hrs p.i.) they changed into fine granules filling the whole nucleus.",M1
11991989,"Pivotal role of the non-hr origin of DNA replication in the genesis of defective interfering baculoviruses.The generation of deletion mutants, including defective interfering viruses, upon serial passage of Spodoptera exigua multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) in insect cell culture has been studied. Sequences containing the non-homologous region origin of DNA replication (non-hr <e>ori</e>) became hypermolar in intracellular viral DNA within 10 passages in Se301 insect cells, concurrent with a dramatic drop in budded virus and polyhedron production. These predominant non-hr ori-containing sequences accumulated in larger concatenated forms and were generated de novo as demonstrated by their appearance and accumulation upon infection with a genetically homogeneous bacterial clone of SeMNPV (bacmid). Sequences were identified at the junctions of the non-hr ori units within the concatemers, which may be potentially involved in recombination events. Deletion of the SeMNPV non-hr ori using RecE/RecT-mediated homologous ET recombination in Escherichia coli resulted in a recombinant bacmid with strongly enhanced stability of virus and polyhedron production upon serial passage in insect cells. This suggests that the accumulation of non-hr oris upon passage is due to the replication advantage of these sequences. The non-hr ori deletion mutant SeMNPV bacmid can be exploited as a stable eukaryotic heterologous protein expression vector in insect cells.",M1
11973295,"The mitochondrial nucleoid protein, Mgm101p, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is involved in the maintenance of rho(+) and <e>ori</e>/rep-devoid petite genomes but is not required for hypersuppressive rho(-) mtDNA.The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MGM101 gene encodes a DNA-binding protein targeted to mitochondrial nucleoids. MGM101 is essential for maintenance of a functional rho(+) genome because meiotic segregants, with a disrupted mgm101 allele, cannot undergo more than 10 divisions on glycerol medium. Quantitative analysis of mtDNA copy number in a rho(+) strain carrying a temperature-sensitive allele, mgm101-1, revealed that the amount of mtDNA is halved each cell division upon a shift to the restrictive temperature. These data suggest that mtDNA replication is rapidly blocked in cells lacking MGM101. However, a small proportion of meiotic segregants, disrupted in MGM101, have rho(-) genomes that are stably maintained. Interestingly, all surviving rho(-) mtDNAs contain an ori/rep sequence. Disruption of MGM101 in hypersuppressive (HS) strains does not have a significant effect on the propagation of HS rho(-) mtDNA. However, in petites lacking an ori/rep, disruption of MGM101 leads to either a complete loss or a dramatically decreased stability of mtDNA. This discriminatory effect of MGM101 suggests that replication of rho(+) and ori/rep-devoid rho(-) mtDNAs is carried out by the same process. By contrast, the persistence of ori/rep-containing mtDNA in HS petites lacking MGM101 identifies a distinct replication pathway. The alternative mtDNA replication mechanism provided by ori/rep is independent of mitochondrial RNA polymerase encoded by RPO41 as a HS rho(-) genome is stably maintained in a mgm101, rpo41 double mutant.",M1
18038194,"Causal factors implicated in research misconduct: evidence from <e>ORI</e> case files.There has been relatively little empirical research into the causes of research misconduct. To begin to address this void, the authors collected data from closed case files of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI). These data were in the form of statements extracted from ORI file documents including transcripts, investigative reports, witness statements, and correspondence. Researchers assigned these statements to 44 different concepts. These concepts were then analyzed using multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis. The authors chose a solution consisting of seven clusters: (1) personal and professional stressors, (2) organizational climate, (3) job insecurities, (4) rationalizations A, (5) personal inhibitions, (6) rationalizations B and, (7) personality factors. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for policy and for future research.",M2
17181505,"Research misconduct: Can Australia learn from the UK's stuttering system?Research and publication misconduct is commoner than many believe, hard to detect and difficult to investigate, with institutions often being reluctant to take action. The first countries to set up formal systems for policing research misconduct were the United States and some Scandinavian countries. The US Office of Research Integrity (<e>ORI</e>) is a useful model for other countries; rather than conduct investigations, the ORI supervises the investigation by the respondent's institution. The United Kingdom has taken more than 10 years to set up a national supervisory body - the UK Panel for Research Integrity in Health and Biomedical Sciences. Unlike the ORI, it has no statutory basis. It is too early to tell whether the procedures set up in the UK will work. The present trend for governments to encourage universities to link up with industry may lead to a culture of secrecy and confused accountability. In any country, including Australia, intent on policing research, it is only possible for editors, reviewers or readers to initiate investigations, not undertake them, as power lies in the hands of employers, research funders and regulatory bodies.",M2
16816133,"Complainant issues in research misconduct: the office of research integrity experience.This paper discusses the experiences of the Office of Research Integrity (<e>ORI</e>) with issues involving complainants who make allegations of research misconduct. The paper describes the legal framework for complainant issues, the various roles of the complainant as the allegation of misconduct proceeds through the steps of investigation and resolution, how allegations of retaliation against the complainant are handled, the responsibilities of ORI and of the research institution where the alleged misconduct occurred, and ORI's experience with several cases of alleged retaliation. In each of these areas, the paper attempts to provide guidance to prospective complainants, research institutions, and other interested persons on effective ways to approach the various problems and concerns that arise, while maintaining a balance between the needs of the complainant, the accused, the research institution handling the allegation, and ORI.",M2
16634172,"Assessing the educational literature in the responsible conduct of research for core content.To determine core content for RCR instruction, content analysis was conducted using key instructional resources for <e>ORI</e>'s nine RCR  core instructional areas . Topics discussed in these key RCR resources were identified and their frequency across resources was tabulated. Topics covered most frequently were judged to be core content. Although key educational resources cited a variety of references, specific topics and issues addressed were generally consistent across the materials examined. Nonetheless, key resources varied in organization and depth of coverage for core instructional areas. Recent resources were more systematic and comprehensive than earlier works. This was particularly evident in materials about human participant research, conflicts of interest, and data management and sharing. Key resources presented additional  non-core  issues, such as scientific values, ethical principles, creativity and objectivity, moral reasoning, genetics, epidemiological issues, and scientists' societal roles, suggesting that ORI's core instructional areas should be reconfigured or expanded. Because educational material available on RCR and professionalism was so comprehensive, we recommend that ORI consider research integrity, not research misconduct, as one core instructional area. We also recommend that compliance with research regulations be restored as a core instructional area to accentuate ethical, financial and legal requirements related to acceptance of federal funding.",M2
16279291,"<e>ORI</e> findings of scientific misconduct in clinical trials and publicly funded research, 1992-2002.BACKGROUND: Since 1992 the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) had reviewed investigations of scientific misconduct in research funded by the US Public Health Service (PHS). ORI defined scientific misconduct as  fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other practices that seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the scientific community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research . PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to summarize the findings and administrative actions reported in ORI notices of scientific misconduct in clinical trials occurring between May 1992 and 2002. METHODS: Findings of misconduct were gathered from publicly available sources: the ORI annual reports and the NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts. RESULTS: Clinical trials accounted for 17 (13%) of the 136 investigations that resulted in findings of scientific misconduct, and they were noted in 12 (11%) of the 113 brief reports of investigations closed with findings of no scientific misconduct. In clinical trials, the most severe sanction, debarment from US Government funding, was applied in six (35%) of the cases of misconduct compared to 79 (66%) of 119 cases from all other types of research combined. Of individuals cited for misconduct in clinical trials, three (18%) held doctorates in contrast to 81 (68%) in other types of research. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical trials, junior employees may bear the burden of sanction for scientific misconduct. The most frequently applied sanction was the requirement that a plan of supervision of the sanctioned employees accompany any future application for funding which would include them. This imposition of sanction on an individual employee does not address possible causes of misconduct which may be inherent in the overall pattern of leadership, training and supervision in the trial. Furthermore, the definition of misconduct, as interpreted by the Departmental Appeals Board, excludes carelessness and other poor research practices that may lead to dissemination of more incorrect data than misconduct.",M2
14979320,"The role of culture in research misconduct.There seems to be a taboo against discussing the role culture or national origin might play in research misconduct. Still, some observers wonder why so many scientists representing foreign cultures are among those found guilty of misconduct. Even after examining the scant available data, whether foreign nationals are disproportionately represented among Office of Research Integrity (<e>ORI</e>) respondents remains unclear. The lack of data, however, does not negate culture as a possible explanatory variable in research misconduct. Applying theories from sociological criminology, the author posits that the culture some researchers bring may be at odds with the norms of academic science and may emphasize ends more than means. As such, culture simply may be one of several etiological factors in research misconduct and should be considered in the spirit of objective scientific inquiry. Acknowledging the role of culture in the adherence to research ethics underscores the importance of education and training of both researchers and administrators in the responsible conduct of research and cultural diversity.",M2

10964256,"Scientific misconduct and research integrity for the bench scientist.This paper describes the role of the Office of Research Integrity (<e>ORI</e>), a component of the Public Health Service (PHS), in defining scientific misconduct in research supported with PHS funds and in establishing standards for responding to allegations of misconduct. The principal methods by which ORI exercises its responsibilities in this area are defining what types of behaviors undertaken by research investigators constitute misconduct, overseeing institutional efforts to investigate and report misconduct, and recommending to the Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) PHS administrative actions when misconduct is identified. ORI also takes affirmative steps to promote research integrity through education, training, and other initiatives. The role of the research institution in responding to misconduct and promoting research integrity is complementary and overlapping with ORI's efforts but, as the employer of research investigators and front-line manager of the research, the institution has a greater opportunity to promote the highest standards of integrity in the day-to-day conduct of research. Finally, legal precedent established through civil litigation has played an important role in defining the standards that apply in determining when a breach of research integrity has occurred.",M2
10523125,"Office of Research Integrity: a reflection of disputes and misunderstandings.Each year, the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) provides billions of dollars to support over 30,000 extramural research grants to more than 2,000 institutions in the U.S. and other countries. The Office of Research Integrity (<e>ORI</e>) is responsible for protecting the integrity of the research supported by the grants awarded for the PHS extramural research program. One of its responsibilities includes monitoring investigations into alleged or suspected scientific misconduct by institutions that receive the PHS funds. However, not all of the alleged or suspected scientific misconduct meet the the PHS definition of scientific misconduct. Among the wide range of allegations that the ORI receives are those that are ultimately determined to be authorship disputes. This article will report on ORI's functions and review some of the commonly reported allegations that do not constitute scientific misconduct according to the PHS definition.",M2

Although the record shows that research institutions and the <e>ORI</e> have treated such allegations seriously, the fraction of complainants to the ORI who remain anonymous is small (8% of 986 allegations); few anonymous complaints are sufficiently substantive to be pursued (4% of the 357 formal cases opened in the ORI); and only 1 of these 13 cases resulted in an ORI finding of scientific misconduct.",M2
9109472,"Improving the scientific misconduct hearing process.The overturning and withdrawal of several of the Office of Research Integrity's (<e>ORI</e>'s) findings of scientific misconduct have called its role into question. The contested findings of scientific misconduct that have been tried before the hearing body have been based on lengthy and expensive ORI investigations. How could ORI have failed to prove its findings of scientific misconduct after the commitment of substantial resources that far exceed those devoted during institutional investigations? One reason may be that the current hearing process makes it difficult or impossible for ORI, institutions, or individuals to prove scientific misconduct. The hearing process has been criticized by discouraged whistleblowers who believe that their allegations of scientific misconduct should have been upheld, and by the accused for the expensive and protracted nature of the proceedings. The following article examines problems in the scientific misconduct hearing process and suggests that the process could be improved by letting administrative law judges, patent attorneys, and a scientific majority decide these cases.",M2
