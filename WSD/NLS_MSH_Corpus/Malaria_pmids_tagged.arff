20351286,"A prospective analysis of the Ab response to Plasmodium falciparum before and after a <e>malaria</e> season by protein microarray.Abs are central to malaria immunity, which is only acquired after years of exposure to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Despite the enormous worldwide burden of malaria, the targets of protective Abs and the basis of their inefficient acquisition are unknown. Addressing these knowledge gaps could accelerate malaria vaccine development. To this end, we developed a protein microarray containing approximately 23% of the Pf 5,400-protein proteome and used this array to probe plasma from 220 individuals between the ages of 2-10 years and 18-25 years in Mali before and after the 6-month malaria season. Episodes of malaria were detected by passive surveillance over the 8-month study period. Ab reactivity to Pf proteins rose dramatically in children during the malaria season; however, most of this response appeared to be short-lived based on cross-sectional analysis before the malaria season, which revealed only modest incremental increases in Ab reactivity with age. Ab reactivities to 49 Pf proteins measured before the malaria season were significantly higher in 8-10-year-old children who were infected with Pf during the malaria season but did not experience malaria (n = 12) vs. those who experienced malaria (n = 29). This analysis also provided insight into patterns of Ab reactivity against Pf proteins based on the life cycle stage at which proteins are expressed, subcellular location, and other proteomic features. This approach, if validated in larger studies and in other epidemiological settings, could prove to be a useful strategy for better understanding fundamental properties of the human immune response to Pf and for identifying previously undescribed vaccine targets.",M1
20346126,"Engaging diverse communities participating in clinical trials: case examples from across Africa.BACKGROUND: In the advent of increasing international collaborative research involving participants drawn from populations with diverse cultural backgrounds, community engagement becomes very critical for the smooth conduction of the research. The African <e>Malaria</e> Network Trust (AMANET) is a pan-African non-governmental organization that sponsors and technically supports malaria vaccine trials in various African countries. CASE DESCRIPTION: AMANET sponsored phase Ib or IIb clinical trials of several malaria vaccine candidates in various Africa countries. In Burkina Faso, Mali and Tanzania trials of the merozoite surface protein 3 -- in its Long Synthetic Peptide configuration (MSP3 LSP) -- were conducted. In Mali, the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) was tested, while a hybrid of glutamate rich protein (GLURP) and MSP3 (GMZ2) was tested in Gabon. AMANET recognizes the importance of engaging with the communities from which trial participants are drawn, hence community engagement was given priority in all project activities conducted in the various countries. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: Existing local social systems were used to engage the communities from which clinical trial participants were drawn. This article focuses on community engagement activities employed at various AMANET-supported clinical trial sites in different countries, highlighting subtle differences in the approaches used. The paper also gives some general pros and cons of community engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Community engagement enables two-way sharing of accurate information and ideas between researchers and researched communities, which helps to create an environment conducive to smooth research activities with enhanced sense of research ownership by the communities.",M1
20331863,"Heterogeneity in <e>malaria</e> exposure and vaccine response: implications for the interpretation of vaccine efficacy trials.BACKGROUND: Phase III trials of the malaria vaccine, RTS, S, are now underway across multiple sites of varying transmission intensity in Africa. Heterogeneity in exposure, vaccine response and waning of efficacy may bias estimates of vaccine efficacy. METHODS: Theoretical arguments are used to identify the expected effects of a) heterogeneity in exposure to infectious bites; b) heterogeneity in individual's response to the vaccine; and c) waning efficacy on measures of vaccine efficacy from clinical trials for an infection-blocking vaccine. RESULTS: Heterogeneity in exposure and vaccine response leads to a smaller proportion of trial participants becoming infected than one would expect in a homogeneous setting. This causes estimates of vaccine efficacy from clinical trials to be underestimated if transmission heterogeneity is ignored, and overestimated if heterogeneity in vaccine response is ignored. Waning of vaccine efficacy can bias estimates of vaccine efficacy in both directions. CONCLUSIONS: Failure to account for heterogeneities in exposure and response, and waning of efficacy in clinical trials can lead to biased estimates of malaria vaccine efficacy. Appropriate methods to reduce these biases need to be used to ensure accurate interpretation and comparability between trial sites of results from the upcoming Phase III clinical trials of RTS, S.",M1
20298576,"Antibodies against multiple merozoite surface antigens of the human <e>malaria</e> parasite Plasmodium falciparum inhibit parasite maturation and red blood cell invasion.BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum merozoites expose at their surface a large protein complex, which is composed of fragments of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1; called MSP-183, MSP-130, MSP-138, and MSP-142) plus associated processing products of MSP-6 and MSP-7. During erythrocyte invasion this complex, as well as an integral membrane protein called apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1), is shed from the parasite surface following specific proteolysis. Components of the MSP-1/6/7 complex and AMA-1 are presently under development as malaria vaccines. METHODS: The specificities and effects of antibodies directed against MSP-1, MSP-6, MSP-7 on the growth of blood stage parasites were studied using ELISA and the pLDH-assay. To understand the mode of action of these antibodies, their effects on processing of MSP-1 and AMA-1 on the surface of merozoites were investigated. RESULTS: Antibodies targeting epitopes located throughout the MSP-1/6/7 complex interfere with shedding of MSP-1, and as a consequence prevent erythrocyte invasion. Antibodies targeting the MSP-1/6/7 complex have no effect on the processing and shedding of AMA-1 and, similarly, antibodies blocking the shedding of AMA-1 do not affect cleavage of MSP-1, suggesting completely independent functions of these proteins during invasion. Furthermore, some epitopes, although eliciting highly inhibitory antibodies, are only poorly recognized by the immune system when presented in the structural context of the intact antigen. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reported provide further support for the development of vaccines based on MSP-1/6/7 and AMA-1, which would possibly include a combination of these antigens.",M1
20236549,"Solution structure of a Plasmodium falciparum AMA-1/MSP 1 chimeric protein vaccine candidate (PfCP-2.9) for <e>malaria</e>.BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium falciparum chimeric protein PfCP-2.9 is a promising asexual-stage malaria vaccine evaluated in clinical trials. This chimeric protein consists of two cysteine-rich domains: domain III of the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1 [III]) and the C-terminal region of the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1-19). It has been reported that the fusion of these two antigens enhanced their immunogenicity and antibody-mediated inhibition of parasite growth in vitro. METHODS: The 15N-labeled and 13C/15N-labeled PfCP-2.9 was produced in Pichia pastoris for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure analysis. The chemical shift assignments of PfCP-2.9 were compared with those previously reported for the individual domains (i.e., PfAMA-1(III) or PfMSP 1-19). The two-dimensional spectra and transverse relaxation rates (R2) of the PfMSP1-19 alone were compared with that of the PfCP-2.9. RESULTS: Confident backbone assignments were obtained for 122 out of 241 residues of PfCP-2.9. The assigned residues in PfCP-2.9 were very similar to those previously reported for the individual domains. The conformation of the PfMSP1-19 in different constructs is essentially the same. Comparison of transverse relaxation rates (R2) strongly suggests no weak interaction between the domains. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the fusion of AMA-1(III) and MSP1-19 as chimeric protein did not change their structures, supporting the use of the chimeric protein as a potential malaria vaccine.",M1
20231693,"Protein-DNA complex is the exclusive <e>malaria</e> parasite component that activates dendritic cells and triggers innate immune responses.Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in the development of protective immunity to malaria. However, it remains unclear how malaria parasites trigger immune responses in DCs. In this study, we purified merozoites, food vacuoles, and parasite membrane fragments released during the Plasmodium falciparum schizont burst to homogeneity and tested for the activation of bone marrow-derived DCs from wild-type and TLR2(-/-), TLR4(-/-), TLR9(-/-), and MyD88(-/-) C57BL/6J mice. The results demonstrate that a protein-DNA complex is the exclusive parasite component that activates DCs by a TLR9-dependent pathway to produce inflammatory cytokines. Complex formation with proteins is essential for the entry of parasite DNA into DCs for TLR9 recognition and, thus, proteins convert inactive DNA into a potent immunostimulatory molecule. Exogenous cationic polymers, polylysine and chitosan, can impart stimulatory activity to parasite DNA, indicating that complex formation involves ionic interactions. Merozoites and DNA-protein complex could also induce inflammatory cytokine responses in human blood DCs. Hemozoin is neither a TLR9 ligand for DCs nor functions as a carrier of DNA into cells. Additionally, although TLR9 is critical for DCs to induce the production of IFN-gamma by NK cells, this receptor is not required for NK cells to secret IFN-gamma, and cell-cell contact among myeloid DCs, plasmacytoid DCs, and NK cells is required for IFN-gamma production. Together, these results contribute substantially toward the understanding of malaria parasite-recognition mechanisms. More importantly, our finding that proteins and carbohydrate polymers are able to confer stimulatory activity to an otherwise inactive parasite DNA have important implications for the development of a vaccine against malaria.",M1
20204850,"An efficient approach to the production of vaccines against the <e>malaria</e> parasite.In malaria vaccine research, one of the major obstacles has been the difficulty of expressing recombinant malarial proteins and it is mainly due to the lack of an efficient methodology for the synthesis of sufficient quantity of quality proteins. We demonstrate that the wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system can be applied for the successful production of leading malaria vaccine candidate antigens and, thus, prove that it may be a key tool for malaria vaccine research.",M1
20194590,"Immunization with VAR2CSA-DBL5 recombinant protein elicits broadly cross-reactive antibodies to placental Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes.Pregnancy-associated <e>malaria</e> is a severe clinical syndrome associated with the sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. Placental binding is mediated by VAR2CSA, a member of the large and diverse P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane 1 (PfEMP1) protein family. To better understand if conserved regions in VAR2CSA can be targeted by antibodies, we immunized rabbits with VAR2CSA-DBL1 and -DBL5 recombinant proteins produced in Pichia pastoris and developed a panel of seven chondroitin sulfate A (CSA)-binding parasites from diverse geographic origins. Overall, no two parasites in the panel expressed the same VAR2CSA sequence. The DBL1 domains averaged 80% amino acid identity (range, 72 to 89%), and the DBL5 domains averaged 86% amino acid identity (range, 83 to 99%), similar to a broader sampling of VAR2CSA sequences from around the world. Whereas antibodies generated against the VAR2CSA-DBL1 recombinant protein had only limited breadth and reacted with three or four parasites in the panel, immunization with DBL5 recombinant proteins elicited broadly cross-reactive antibodies against all or most parasites in the panel, as well as to fresh clinical isolates from pregnant women. These findings demonstrate that the major PfEMP1 variant expressed by placental isolates exposes strain-transcendent epitopes that can be targeted by vaccination and may have application for pregnancy malaria vaccine development.",M1
20188680,"Adenovectors induce functional antibodies capable of potent inhibition of blood stage <e>malaria</e> parasite growth.An effective malaria vaccine remains a global health priority. Recombinant adenoviruses are a promising vaccine platform, and Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and merozoite surface protein 1-42 (MSP1(42)) are leading blood stage vaccine candidates. We evaluated the importance of surface antigen localization and glycosylation on the immunogenicity of adenovector delivered AMA1 and MSP1(42) and assessed the ability of these vaccines to induce functional antibody responses capable of inhibiting parasite growth in vitro. Adenovector delivery induced unprecedented levels of biologically active antibodies in rabbits as indicated by the parasite growth inhibition assay. These responses were as potent as published results using any other vaccine system, including recombinant protein in adjuvant. The cell surface associated and glycosylated forms of AMA1 and MSP1(42) elicited 99% and 60% inhibition of parasite growth, respectively. Antigens that were expressed at the cell surface and glycosylated were much better than intracellular antigens at inducing antibody responses. Good T cell responses were observed for all forms of AMA1 and MSP1(42). Antigen-specific antibody responses, but typically not T cell responses, were boosted by a second administration of adenovector. These data highlight the importance of rational vaccine design and support the advancement of adenovector delivery technology for a malaria vaccine.",M1
20188676,"Helminth infection impairs the immunogenicity of a Plasmodium falciparum DNA vaccine, but not irradiated sporozoites, in mice.Development of an effective vaccine against <e>malaria</e> remains a priority. However, a significant number of individuals living in tropical areas are also likely to be co-infected with helminths, which are known to adversely affect immune responses to a number of different existing vaccines. Here we compare the response to two prototype malaria vaccines: a transmission blocking DNA vaccine based on Pfs25, and a pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine based on irradiated sporozoites in mice infected with the intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus. Following primary immunization with Pfs25 DNA vaccine, levels of total IgG, as well as IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b (all P=0.0002), and IgG3 (P=0.03) Pfs25 antibodies were significantly lower in H. polygyrus-infected mice versus worm-free controls. Similar results were observed even after two additional boosts, while clearance of worms with anthelmintic treatment 3 weeks prior to primary immunization significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of helminth infection. In contrast, helminth infection had no inhibitory effect on immunization with irradiated sporozoites. Mean anti-CSP antibody responses were similar between H. polygyrus-infected and worm-free control mice following immunization with a single dose (65,000 sporozoites) of live radiation attenuated (irradiated) Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites (17X, non-lethal strain), and protection upon sporozoite challenge was equivalent between groups. These results indicate that helminth infection may adversely affect certain anti-malarial vaccine strategies, and highlight the importance of these interactions for malaria vaccine development.",M1
20173408,"The past decade in <e>malaria</e> synthetic peptide vaccine clinical trials.Over the past decade (2000-2009), there have been nine clinical trials of synthetic malaria peptide vaccines designed to target the pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic stages of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. Recent advances in parasite immunology and cell biology have been utilized to improve peptide design and adjuvant formulations. The clinical trials demonstrated the potential of second generation peptide vaccines to elicit antibodies that can neutralize sporozoite infectivity and cooperate with monocytes in ADCI to inhibit blood stage parasites. In addition, peptide-induced malaria-specific human CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were shown in vitro to have similar fine specificity and function as parasite-induced T cells. The results of these clinical trials, while encouraging, have emphasized the critical roles of immunological assays, in particular functional assays, for the evaluation of potential vaccine candidates. Additional challenges include the need for potent adjuvants for the development of synthetic peptide vaccines that can effectively target multiple stages of the Plasmodium parasite.",M1
20173407,"Vaccines against <e>malaria</e>: perspectives from Papua New Guinea.Despite its small population and isolated location Papua New Guinea (PNG) with a malaria burden comparable to sub-Saharan Africa, its intense transmission of all four human Plasmodium species and an unrivalled combination of environmental and human variation offers unique perspectives on malaria vaccines. Building on a long history of malaria research, in this article we review past achievements, highlight current research and outline future directions in malaria vaccine research. With intensive transmission of all four species of human malaria, a full range of malaria endemicities, well described epidemiology and a demonstrated capacity to evaluate a malaria vaccine, PNG currently has the only field site that is ready to conduct proof-of-principle studies of currently available P. vivax vaccine candidates and future combined P. falciparum / P. vivax vaccines and also offers unique opportunities for P. falciparum vaccine research. PNG is thus ready to contribute significantly in the global malaria vaccine endeavor.",M1
20170765,"Immunogenic properties of a recombinant fusion protein containing the C-terminal 19 kDa of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 and the innate immunity agonist FliC flagellin of Salmonella typhimurium.In a recent study, we demonstrated the immunogenic properties of a new <e>malaria</e> vaccine polypeptide based on a 19 kDa C-terminal fragment of the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1(19)) from Plasmodium vivax and an innate immunity agonist, the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium flagellin (FliC). Herein, we tested whether the same strategy, based on the MSP1(19) component of the deadly malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, could also generate a fusion polypeptide with enhanced immunogenicity. The His(6)FliC-MSP1(19) fusion protein was expressed from a recombinant Escherichia coli and showed preserved in vitro TLR5-binding activity. In contrast to animals injected with His(6)MSP1(19), mice subcutaneously immunised with the recombinant His(6)FliC-MSP1(19) developed strong MSP1(19)-specific systemic antibody responses with a prevailing IgG1 subclass. Incorporation of other adjuvants, such as CpG ODN 1826, complete and incomplete Freund's adjuvants or Quil-A, improved the IgG responses after the second, but not the third, immunising dose. It also resulted in a more balanced IgG subclass response, as evaluated by the IgG1/IgG2c ratio, and higher cell-mediated immune response, as determined by the detection of antigen-specific interferon-gamma secretion by immune spleen cells. MSP1(19)-specific antibodies recognised not only the recombinant protein, but also the native protein expressed on the surface of P. falciparum parasites. Finally, sera from rabbits immunised with the fusion protein alone inhibited the in vitro growth of three different P. falciparum strains. In summary, these results extend our previous observations and further demonstrate that fusion of the innate immunity agonist FliC to Plasmodium antigens is a promising alternative to improve their immunogenicity.",M1

20165550,"Extreme polymorphism in a vaccine antigen and risk of clinical <e>malaria</e>: implications for vaccine development.Vaccines directed against the blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum malaria are intended to prevent the parasite from invading and replicating within host cells. No blood-stage malaria vaccine has shown clinical efficacy in humans. Most malaria vaccine antigens are parasite surface proteins that have evolved extensive genetic diversity, and this diversity could allow malaria parasites to escape vaccine-induced immunity. We examined the extent and within-host dynamics of genetic diversity in the blood-stage malaria vaccine antigen apical membrane antigen-1 in a longitudinal study in Mali. Two hundred and fourteen unique apical membrane antigen-1 haplotypes were identified among 506 human infections, and amino acid changes near a putative invasion machinery binding site were strongly associated with the development of clinical symptoms, suggesting that these residues may be important to consider in designing polyvalent apical membrane antigen-1 vaccines and in assessing vaccine efficacy in field trials. This extreme diversity may pose a serious obstacle to an effective polyvalent recombinant subunit apical membrane antigen-1 vaccine.",M1
20114028,"Immunogenicity of whole-parasite vaccines against Plasmodium falciparum involves malarial hemozoin and host TLR9.Although whole-parasite vaccine strategies for <e>malaria</e> infection have regained attention, their immunological mechanisms of action remain unclear. We find that immunization of mice with a crude blood stage extract of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum elicits parasite antigen-specific immune responses via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 and that the malarial heme-detoxification byproduct, hemozoin (HZ), but not malarial DNA, produces a potent adjuvant effect. Malarial and synthetic (s)HZ bound TLR9 directly to induce conformational changes in the receptor. The adjuvant effect of sHZ depended on its method of synthesis and particle size. Although natural HZ acts as a TLR9 ligand, the adjuvant effects of synthetic HZ are independent of TLR9 or the NLRP3-inflammasome but are dependent on MyD88. The adjuvant function of sHZ was further validated in a canine antiallergen vaccine model. Thus, HZ can influence adaptive immune responses to malaria infection and may have therapeutic value in vaccine adjuvant development.",M1

20107498,"Phase 1 trial of the Plasmodium falciparum blood stage vaccine MSP1(42)-C1/Alhydrogel with and without CPG 7909 in <e>malaria</e> naïve adults.BACKGROUND: Merozoite surface protein 1(42) (MSP1(42)) is a leading blood stage malaria vaccine candidate. In order to induce immune responses that cover the major antigenic polymorphisms, FVO and 3D7 recombinant proteins of MSP1(42) were mixed (MSP1(42)-C1). To improve the level of antibody response, MSP1(42)-C1 was formulated with Alhydrogel plus the novel adjuvant CPG 7909. METHODS: A Phase 1 clinical trial was conducted in healthy malaria-naïve adults at the Center for Immunization Research in Washington, D.C., to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of MSP1(42)-C1/Alhydrogel +/- CPG 7909. Sixty volunteers were enrolled in dose escalating cohorts and randomized to receive three vaccinations of either 40 or 160 microg protein adsorbed to Alhydrogel +/- 560 microg CPG 7909 at 0, 1 and 2 months. RESULTS: Vaccinations were well tolerated, with only one related adverse event graded as severe (Grade 3 injection site erythema) and all other vaccine related adverse events graded as either mild or moderate. Local adverse events were more frequent and severe in the groups receiving CPG. The addition of CPG enhanced anti-MSP1(42) antibody responses following vaccination by up to 49-fold two weeks after second immunization and 8-fold two weeks after the third immunization when compared to MSP1(42)-C1/Alhydrogel alone (p&lt;0.0001). After the third immunization, functionality of the antibody was tested by an in vitro growth inhibition assay. Inhibition was a function of antibody titer, with an average of 3% (range -2 to 10%) in the non CPG groups versus 14% (3 to 32%) in the CPG groups. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The favorable safety profile and high antibody responses induced with MSP1(42)-C1/Alhydrogel + CPG 7909 are encouraging. MSP1(42)-C1/Alhydrogel is being combined with other blood stage antigens and will be taken forward in a formulation adjuvanted with CPG 7909.

20098724,"The relationship between anti-merozoite antibodies and incidence of Plasmodium falciparum <e>malaria</e>: A systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: One of the criteria to objectively prioritize merozoite antigens for malaria vaccine development is the demonstration that naturally acquired antibodies are associated with protection from malaria. However, published evidence of the protective effect of these antibodies is conflicting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies examining the association between anti-merozoite immunoglobin (Ig) G responses and incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Two independent researchers searched six databases and identified 33 studies that met predefined inclusion and quality criteria, including a rigorous definition of symptomatic malaria. We found that only five studies were performed outside sub-Saharan Africa and that there was a deficiency in studies investigating antibodies to leading vaccine candidates merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1(42) and erythrocyte binding antigen (EBA)-175. Meta-analyses of most-studied antigens were conducted to obtain summary estimates of the association between antibodies and incidence of P. falciparum malaria. The largest effect was observed with IgG to MSP-3 C terminus and MSP-1(19) (responders versus nonresponders, 54%, 95% confidence interval [CI] [33%-68%] and 18% [4%-30%] relative reduction in risk, respectively) and there was evidence of a dose-response relationship. A tendency towards protective risk ratios (RR&lt;1) was also observed for individual study estimates for apical membrane antigen (AMA)-1 and glutamate-rich protein (GLURP)-R0. Pooled estimates showed limited evidence of a protective effect for antibodies to MSP-1 N-terminal regions or MSP-1-EGF (epidermal growth factor-like modules). There was no significant evidence for the protective effect for MSP-2 (responders versus nonresponders pooled RR, MSP-2(FC27) 0.82, 95% CI 0.62-1.08, p = 0.16 and MSP-2(3D7) 0.92, 95% CI 0.75-1.13, p = 0.43). Heterogeneity, in terms of clinical and methodological diversity between studies, was an important issue in the meta-analysis of IgG responses to merozoite antigens. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are valuable for advancing vaccine development by providing evidence supporting merozoite antigens as targets of protective immunity in humans, and to help identify antigens that confer protection from malaria. Further prospective cohort studies that include a larger number of lead antigens and populations outside Africa are greatly needed to ensure generalizability of results. The reporting of results needs to be standardized to maximize comparability of studies. We therefore propose a set of guidelines to facilitate the uniform reporting of malaria immuno-epidemiology observational studies. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.",M1
20080619,"A bicomponent Plasmodium falciparum investigational vaccine composed of protein-peptide conjugates.There is yet no licensed vaccine against <e>malaria</e>, a serious human disease affecting mostly children, with an annual death rate of about one million. Plasmodia, the malaria-causing parasites, have two obligatory hosts: mammals or birds, in which they multiply asexually, and mosquitoes with sexual multiplication. The most common and serious type of malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a major surface antigen of sporozoites, is a protective antigen. A unique feature of P. falciparum CSP is its large central domain composed of over 30 tetrapeptide repeats of Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro (NANP). Several NANP peptide-protein conjugates were tested clinically but elicited a low level of CSP antibodies for a short duration. To provide a CSP-based candidate vaccine, we investigated recombinant CSP and NANP conjugates of various peptide lengths, with different N-terminal amino acids, bound at different ratios to various carrier proteins. Injected into mice, CSP alone and CSP or NANP conjugates induced antibodies with booster responses and were positive by the sporozoite immunofluorescent assay. The use of the mosquito stage P. falciparum ookinete surface protein, Pfs25, cross-linked onto itself as a carrier for NANP, induced in mice high levels of uniquely long-lasting antibodies to both vaccine components with secondary biological activities, that will provide immunity to liver infection by sporozoites and block transmission by mosquitoes.",M1
20078211,"Expression of genes associated with immunoproteasome processing of major histocompatibility complex peptides is indicative of protection with adjuvanted RTS,S <e>malaria</e> vaccine.BACKGROUND: Patterns of expressed genes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of persons who were receiving RTS,S/AS01 or RTS,S/AS02 malaria vaccine and were undergoing experimental challenge with mosquito-borne falciparum malaria were examined to identify markers associated with protection. METHODS: Thirty-nine vaccine recipients were assessed at study entry; on the day of the third vaccination; at 24 h, 72 h, and 2 weeks after vaccination; and on day 5 after challenge. Of 39 vaccine recipients, 13 were protected and 26 were not. Eleven vaccine recipients exhibited delayed onset of parasitemia. All infectivity control subjects developed parasitemia. Prediction analysis of microarrays identified genes corresponding with protection. Gene set enrichment analysis identified sets of genes associated with protection after the third vaccination and before challenge. RESULTS: After the third vaccination and before challenge, differential expression of genes in the immunoproteasome pathway distinguished protected and nonprotected persons. At 5 days after challenge, differential expression of genes associated with programmed cell death distinguished between subjects protected and not protected from malaria blood-stage infection. CONCLUSIONS: The up-regulation of genes associated with the efficient processing of major histocompatibility complex peptides suggests a potential role of the vaccine in conferring major histocompatibility complex class 1-mediated protection and may represent a useful surrogate marker of vaccine efficacy without the need for challenge.",M1
20064234,"Several domains from VAR2CSA can induce Plasmodium falciparum adhesion-blocking antibodies.BACKGROUND: <e>Malaria</e> caused by Plasmodium falciparum can result in several different syndromes with severe clinical consequences for the about 200 million individuals infected each year. During pregnancy, women living in endemic areas become susceptible to malaria due to lack of antibodies against a unique P. falciparum membrane protein, named VAR2CSA. This antigen is not expressed in childhood infections, since it binds chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) expressed on the intervillous space in the placenta. A vaccine appears possible because women acquire protective antibodies hindering sequestration in the placenta as a function of parity. A challenge for vaccine development is to design small constructs of this large antigen, which can induce broadly protective antibodies. It has previously been shown that one domain of VAR2CSA, DBL4-FCR3, induces parasite adhesion-blocking antibodies. In this study, it is demonstrated that other domains of VAR2CSA also can induce antibodies with inhibitory activity. METHODS: All VAR2CSA domains from the 3D7 and HB3 parasites were produced in Baculovirus-transfected insect cells. Groups of three rats per protein were immunized and anti-sera were tested for surface reactivity against infected erythrocytes expressing FCR3 VAR2CSA and for the ability to inhibit FCR3CSA parasite adhesion to CSA. The fine specificity of the immune sera was analysed by VAR2CSA peptide arrays. RESULTS: Inhibitory antibodies were induced by immunization with DBL3-HB3 T1 and DBL1-3D7. However, unlike the previously characterised DBL4-FCR3 response the inhibitory response against DBL1-3D7 and DBL3-HB3 T1 was poorly reproduced in the second rounds of immunizations. CONCLUSION: It is possible to induce parasite adhesion-blocking antibodies when immunizing with a number of different VAR2CSA domains. This indicates that the CSA binding site in VAR2CSA is comprised of epitopes from different domains.",M1
20061802,"Prime-boost vectored <e>malaria</e> vaccines: progress and prospects.The difficulty of inducing protective immunity through antibodies against sporozoites led to efforts to assess vectored vaccines as a means of inducing protective T-cell immunity against the malaria liver-stage parasite. Although DNA vectored vaccines used alone were poorly immunogenic and not protective, high levels of parasite clearance in the liver has been achieved with viral vectored vaccines used in heterologous prime-boost regimes. Such vectored vaccination regimes represent one of only two approaches that have induced repeatable partial efficacy in human P. falciparum subunit vaccine trials. Interestingly, vectors expressing the TRAP antigen have been consistently been more immunogenic and protective than vectors expressing the circumsporozoite protein in human trials. However, sterile protection requires induction of very potent T-cell responses that are currently only achievable with heterologous prime-boost regimes. Recently, simian adenoviruses have been assessed as priming agents in Adenovirus-MVA regimes in both phase I and phase IIa trials in the UK, based on very promising pre-clinical results showing better immunogenicity and efficacy than previous prime-boost regimes. The same vectors are also being assessed clinically expressing blood-stage antigens, attempting to induce both protective antibodies and T cells as recently demonstrated in murine efficacy studies. These viral vectors now provide a major option for inclusion in a high efficacy multi-stage malaria vaccine that should achieve deployable levels of efficacy in endemic settings.",M1

Previous evidence indicates that Plasmodium ookinete-secreted chitinase is important in midgut invasion. The mechanistic role of other ookinete-secreted enzymes in midgut invasion has not been previously examined. De novo mass spectrometry sequencing of a protein obtained by benzamidine affinity column of Plasmodium gallinaceum ookinete axenic culture supernatant demonstrated the presence of an ookinete-secreted plasmepsin, an aspartic protease previously only known to be present in the digestive vacuole of asexual stage malaria parasites. This plasmepsin, the ortholog of Plasmodium falciparum plasmepsin 4, was designated PgPM4. PgPM4 and PgCHT2 (the P. gallinaceum ortholog of P. falciparum chitinase PfCHT1) are both localized on the ookinete apical surface, and both are present in micronemes. Aspartic protease inhibitors (peptidomimetic and natural product), calpain inhibitors, and anti-PgPM4 monoclonal antibodies significantly reduced parasite infectivity for mosquitoes. These results suggest that plasmepsin 4, previously known only to function in the digestive vacuole of asexual blood stage Plasmodium, plays a role in how the ookinete interacts with the mosquito midgut interactions as it becomes an oocyst. These data are the first to delineate a role for an aspartic protease in mediating Plasmodium invasion of the mosquito and demonstrate the potential for plasmepsin 4 as a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine target.",M1
20051276,"Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity trial of the Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage <e>malaria</e> vaccine AMA1-C1/ISA 720 in Australian adults.A Phase 1 trial was conducted in malaria-naïve adults to evaluate the recombinant protein vaccine apical membrane antigen 1-Combination 1 (AMA1-C1) formulated in Montanide ISA 720 (SEPPIC, France), a water-in-oil adjuvant. Vaccinations were halted early due to a formulation issue unrelated to stability or potency. Twenty-four subjects (12 in each group) were enrolled and received 5 or 20 microg protein at 0 and 3 months and four subjects were enrolled and received one vaccination of 80 microg protein. After first vaccination, nearly all subjects experienced mild to moderate local reactions and six experienced delayed local reactions occurring at Day 9 or later. After the second vaccination, three subjects experienced transient grade 3 (severe) local reactions; the remainder experienced grade 1 or 2 local reactions. All related systemic reactogenicity was grade 1 or 2, except one instance of grade 3 malaise. Anti-AMA1-C1 antibody responses were dose dependent and seen following each vaccination, with mean antibody levels 2-3 fold higher in the 20 microg group compared to the 5 microg group at most time points. In vitro growth-inhibitory activity was a function of the anti-AMA1 antibody titer. AMA1-C1 formulated in ISA 720 is immunogenic in malaria-naïve Australian adults. It is reasonably tolerated, though some transient, severe, and late local reactions are seen.",M1
20045030,"The pir multigene family of Plasmodium: antigenic variation and beyond.Multigene families are present on the telomeric and sub-telomeric regions of most chromosomes of the <e>malaria</e> parasite, Plasmodium. The largest gene family identified so far is the Plasmodium interspersed repeat (pir) multigene gene family and is shared by Plasmodium vivax, and simian and rodent malaria species. Most pir genes share a similar structure across the different species; a short first exon, long second exon and a third exon encoding a trans-membrane domain, and some pir genes can be assigned to specific sub-families. Although pir genes can be differentially transcribed in different life cycle stages, suggesting different functions, there is no clear link between sub-family and transcription pattern. Some of the pir genes encode proteins expressed on or near the surface of infected erythrocytes, and therefore could be potential targets of the host's immune response, and involved in antigenic variation and immune evasion. Other functions such as signalling, trafficking and adhesion have been also postulated. The presence of pir in rodent models will allow the investigation of this gene family in vivo and thus their potential as vaccines or in other interventions in human P. vivax infections.",M1

20041125,"Contrasting population structures of the genes encoding ten leading vaccine-candidate antigens of the human <e>malaria</e> parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.The extensive diversity of Plasmodium falciparum antigens is a major obstacle to a broadly effective malaria vaccine but population genetics has rarely been used to guide vaccine design. We have completed a meta-population genetic analysis of the genes encoding ten leading P. falciparum vaccine antigens, including the pre-erythrocytic antigens csp, trap, lsa1 and glurp; the merozoite antigens eba175, ama1, msp's 1, 3 and 4, and the gametocyte antigen pfs48/45. A total of 4553 antigen sequences were assembled from published data and we estimated the range and distribution of diversity worldwide using traditional population genetics, Bayesian clustering and network analysis. Although a large number of distinct haplotypes were identified for each antigen, they were organized into a limited number of discrete subgroups. While the non-merozoite antigens showed geographically variable levels of diversity and geographic restriction of specific subgroups, the merozoite antigens had high levels of diversity globally, and a worldwide distribution of each subgroup. This shows that the diversity of the non-merozoite antigens is organized by physical or other location-specific barriers to gene flow and that of merozoite antigens by features intrinsic to all populations, one important possibility being the immune response of the human host. We also show that current malaria vaccine formulations are based upon low prevalence haplotypes from a single subgroup and thus may represent only a small proportion of the global parasite population. This study demonstrates significant contrasts in the population structure of P. falciparum vaccine candidates that are consistent with the merozoite antigens being under stronger balancing selection than non-merozoite antigens and suggesting that unique approaches to vaccine design will be required. The results of this study also provide a realistic framework for the diversity of these antigens to be incorporated into the design of next-generation malaria vaccines.",M1
20037644,"Quantitative PCR evaluation of cellular immune responses in Kenyan children vaccinated with a candidate <e>malaria</e> vaccine.BACKGROUND: The T-cell mediated immune response plays a central role in the control of malaria after natural infection or vaccination. There is increasing evidence that T-cell responses are heterogeneous and that both the quality of the immune response and the balance between pro-inflammatory and regulatory T-cells determines the outcome of an infection. As Malaria parasites have been shown to induce immunosuppressive responses to the parasite and non-related antigens this study examined T-cell mediated pro-inflammatory and regulatory immune responses induced by malaria vaccination in children in an endemic area to determine if these responses were associated with vaccine immunogenicity. METHODS: Using real-time RT- PCR we profiled the expression of a panel of key markers of immunogenecity at different time points after vaccination with two viral vector vaccines expressing the malaria TRAP antigen (FP9-TRAP and MVA-TRAP) or following rabies vaccination as a control. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The vaccine induced modest levels of IFN-gamma mRNA one week after vaccination. There was also an increase in FoxP3 mRNA expression in both TRAP stimulated and media stimulated cells in the FFM ME-TRAP vaccine group; however, this may have been driven by natural exposure to parasite rather than by vaccination. CONCLUSION: Quantitative PCR is a useful method for evaluating vaccine induced cell mediated immune responses in frozen PBMC from children in a malaria endemic country. Future studies should seek to use vaccine vectors that increase the magnitude and quality of the IFN-gamma immune response in naturally exposed populations and should monitor the induction of a regulatory T cell response.",M1
20009526,"Current status of Plasmodium vivax vaccine.From a total of 2.6 billion people at permanent risk of suffering <e>malaria</e> infection worldwide, 80-300 million experience Plasmodium vivax infections every year, with clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to mild and chronic infection that in some cases lead to severe disease and death. The increasing P. vivax drug resistance and reports of severe and lethal cases, the relapsing parasite behavior and the existence of Plasmodium spp. co-infections must prompt more investment and greater efforts for the development of P. vivax vaccine. Currently there are only two P. vivax vaccine candidates being tested in clinical trials and few others are being assessed in preclinical studies which contrast with the numerous P. falciparum vaccines candidates under evaluation. The recent availability of the P. vivax genome and ongoing proteomic analysis are likely to accelerate P. vivax vaccine development. Recent development of human sporozoite-challenge models would contribute to move clinical development forward and to identify mechanisms of immunity.",M1

19997632,"High antibody titer against apical membrane antigen-1 is required to protect against <e>malaria</e> in the Aotus model.A Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) vaccine, formulated with AS02(A) adjuvant, slowed parasite growth in a recent Phase 1/2a trial, however sterile protection was not observed. We tested this AS02(A), and a Montanide ISA720 (ISA) formulation of 3D7 AMA1 in Aotus monkeys. The 3D7 parasite does not invade Aotus erythrocytes, hence two heterologous strains, FCH/4 and FVO, were used for challenge, FCH/4 AMA1 being more homologous to 3D7 than FVO AMA1. Following three vaccinations, the monkeys were challenged with 50,000 FCH/4 or 10,000 FVO parasites. Three of the six animals in the AMA+ISA group were protected against FCH/4 challenge. One monkey did not become parasitemic, another showed only a short period of low level parasitemia that self-cured, and a third animal showed a delay before exhibiting its parasitemic phase. This is the first protection shown in primates with a recombinant P. falciparum AMA1 without formulation in Freund's complete adjuvant. No animals in the AMA+AS02(A) group were protected, but this group exhibited a trend towards reduced growth rate. A second group of monkeys vaccinated with AMA+ISA vaccine was not protected against FVO challenge, suggesting strain-specificity of AMA1-based protection. Protection against FCH/4 strain correlated with the quantity of induced antibodies, as the protected animals were the only ones to have in vitro parasite growth inhibitory activity of &gt;70% at 1:10 serum dilution; immuno-fluorescence titers &gt;8,000; ELISA titers against full-length AMA1 &gt;300,000 and ELISA titer against AMA1 domains1+2 &gt;100,000. A negative correlation between log ELISA titer and day 11 cumulative parasitemia (Spearman rank r = -0.780, p value = 0.0001), further confirmed the relationship between antibody titer and protection. High titers of cross-strain inhibitory antibodies against AMA1 are therefore critical to confer solid protection, and the Aotus model can be used to down-select future AMA1 formulations, prior to advanced human trials.",M1
19958549,"Cardiac complication after experimental human <e>malaria</e> infection: a case report.A 20 year-old healthy female volunteer participated in a clinical Phase I and IIa safety and efficacy trial with candidate malaria vaccine PfLSA-3-rec adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide. Eleven weeks after the third and last immunization she was experimentally infected by bites of Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquitoes. When the thick blood smear became positive, at day 11, she was treated with artemether/lumefantrine according to protocol. On day 16 post-infection i.e. two days after completion of treatment, she woke up with retrosternal chest pain. She was diagnosed as acute coronary syndrome and treated accordingly. She recovered quickly and her follow-up was uneventful. Whether the event was related to the study procedures such as the preceding vaccinations, malaria infection or antimalarial drugs remains elusive. However, the relation in time with the experimental malaria infection and apparent absence of an underlying condition makes the infection the most probable trigger. This is in striking contrast, however, with the millions of malaria cases each year and the fact that such complication has never been reported in the literature. The rare occurrence of cardiac events with any of the preceding study procedures may even support a coincidental finding. Apart from acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis can be considered as a final diagnosis, but the true nature and patho-physiological explanation of the event remain unclear.",M1
19956619,"Humoral immune response to mixed PfAMA1 alleles; multivalent PfAMA1 vaccines induce broad specificity.Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1), a merozoite protein essential for red cell invasion, is a candidate <e>malaria</e> vaccine component. Immune responses to AMA1 can protect in experimental animal models and antibodies isolated from AMA1-vaccinated or malaria-exposed humans can inhibit parasite multiplication in vitro. The parasite is haploid in the vertebrate host and the genome contains a single copy of AMA1, yet on a population basis a number of AMA1 molecular surface residues are polymorphic, a property thought to be primarily as a result of selective immune pressure. After immunisation with AMA1, antibodies more effectively inhibit strains carrying homologous AMA1 genes, suggesting that polymorphism may compromise vaccine efficacy. Here, we analyse induction of broad strain inhibitory antibodies with a multi-allele Plasmodium falciparum AMA1 (PfAMA1) vaccine, and determine the relative importance of cross-reactive and strain-specific IgG fractions by competition ELISA and in vitro parasite growth inhibition assays. Immunisation of rabbits with a PfAMA1 allele mixture yielded an increased proportion of antibodies to epitopes common to all vaccine alleles, compared to single allele immunisation. Competition ELISA with the anti-PfAMA1 antibody fraction that is cross-reactive between FVO and 3D7 AMA1 alleles showed that over 80% of these common antibodies were shared with other PfAMA1 alleles. Furthermore, growth inhibition assays revealed that for any PfAMA1 allele (FVO or 3D7), the cross-reactive fraction alone, on basis of weight, had the same functional capacity on homologous parasites as the total affinity-purified IgGs (cross-reactive+strain-specific). By contrast, the strain-specific IgG fraction of either PfAMA1 allele showed slightly less inhibition of red cell invasion by homologous strains. Thus multi-allele immunisation relatively increases the levels of antibodies to common allele epitopes. This explains the broadened cross inhibition of diverse malaria parasites, and suggests multi-allele approaches warrant further clinical investigation.",M1
19946222,"Development of a metabolically active, non-replicating sporozoite vaccine to prevent Plasmodium falciparum <e>malaria</e>.Immunization of volunteers by the bite of mosquitoes carrying radiation-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites protects greater than 90% of such volunteers against malaria, if adequate numbers of immunizing biting sessions and sporozoite-infected mosquitoes are used. Nonetheless, until recently it was considered impossible to develop, license and commercialize a live, whole parasite P. falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccine. In 2003 Sanaria scientists reappraised the potential impact of a metabolically active, non-replicating PfSPZ vaccine, and outlined the challenges to producing such a vaccine. Six years later, significant progress has been made in overcoming these challenges. This progress has enabled the manufacture and release of multiple clinical lots of a 1(st) generation metabolically active, non-replicating PfSPZ vaccine, the Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine, submission of a successful Investigational New Drug application to the US Food and Drug Administration, and initiation of safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy studies in volunteers in MD, US. Efforts are now focused on how best to achieve submission of a successful Biologics License Application and introduce the vaccine to the primary target population of African children in the shortest possible period of time. This will require implementation of a systematic, efficient clinical development plan. Short term challenges include optimizing the (1) efficiency and scale up of the manufacturing process and quality control assays, (2) dosage regimen and method of administration, (3) potency of the vaccine, and (4) logistics of delivering the vaccine to those who need it most, and finalizing the methods for vaccine stabilization and attenuation.

19945493,"Computational characterization of Plasmodium falciparum proteomic data for screening of potential vaccine candidates.Advancement in the field of proteomics and bioinformatics offers tremendous opportunities for the development of novel epitope-based effective vaccine against human <e>malaria</e>. In this study, we have characterized 25 antigens as a vaccine candidate and screened the potential T-lymphocyte epitopes presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, and -DR molecules based on the proteomic data of Plasmodium falciparum. Of the 25 proteins, 22 were predicted as probable antigens and two were predicted as adhesions. In addition, seven proteins were predicted to contain signal peptide for secretary pathway and six proteins were found similar to the human and mouse reference proteins, whereas none of the proteins were predicted as allergen. A total of 14,841 peptides were predicted as epitope, presented by HLA class I and II supertypes that covered a broad human population (approximately 95%). Our results suggest that HLA-based multistage and multiepitope malaria vaccine would likely be needed to induce broader CD8(+) as well as CD4(+) T-cell responses. The predicted epitopes may be served as a useful diagnostic reagent for evaluating T-cell responses in the context of natural infection and/or vaccine trials.",M1
19940133,"Role of Plasmodium berghei cGMP-dependent protein kinase in late liver stage development.The liver is the first organ infected by Plasmodium sporozoites during <e>malaria</e> infection. In the infected hepatocytes, sporozoites undergo a complex developmental program to eventually generate hepatic merozoites that are released into the bloodstream in membrane-bound vesicles termed merosomes. Parasites blocked at an early developmental stage inside hepatocytes elicit a protective host immune response, making them attractive targets in the effort to develop a pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine. Here, we generated parasites blocked at a late developmental stage inside hepatocytes by conditionally disrupting the Plasmodium berghei cGMP-dependent protein kinase in sporozoites. Mutant sporozoites are able to invade hepatocytes and undergo intracellular development. However, they remain blocked as late liver stages that do not release merosomes into the medium. These late arrested liver stages induce protection in immunized animals. This suggests that, similar to the well studied early liver stages, late stage liver stages too can confer protection from sporozoite challenge.",M1
19933832,"Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1)-MSP-3 chimeric protein: immunogenicity determined with human-compatible adjuvants and induction of protective immune response.A chimeric gene, MSP-Fu(24), was constructed by genetically coupling immunodominant, conserved regions of the two leading <e>malaria</e> vaccine candidates, Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (C-terminal 19-kDa region [PfMSP-1(19)]) and merozoite surface protein 3 (11-kDa conserved region [PfMSP-3(11)]). The recombinant MSP-Fu(24) protein was produced in Escherichia coli cells and purified to homogeneity by a two-step purification process with a yield of approximately 30 mg/liter. Analyses of conformational properties of MSP-Fu(24) using PfMSP-1(19)-specific monoclonal antibody showed that the conformational epitopes of PfMSP-1(19) that may be critical for the generation of the antiparasitic immune response remained intact in the fusion protein. Recombinant MSP-Fu(24) was highly immunogenic in mice and in rabbits when formulated with two different human-compatible adjuvants and induced an immune response against both PfMSP-1(19) and PfMSP-3(11). Purified anti-MSP-Fu(24) antibodies showed invasion inhibition of P. falciparum 3D7 and FCR parasites, and this effect was found to be dependent on antibodies specific for the PfMSP-1(19) component. The protective potential of MSP-Fu(24) was demonstrated by in vitro parasite growth inhibition using an antibody-dependent cell inhibition (ADCI) assay with anti-MSP-Fu(24) antibodies. Overall, the antiparasitic activity was mediated by a combination of growth-inhibitory antibodies generated by both the PfMSP-1(19) and PfMSP-3(11) components of the MSP-Fu(24) protein. The antiparasitic activities elicited by anti-MSP-Fu(24) antibodies were comparable to those elicited by antibodies generated with immunization with a physical mixture of two component antigens, PfMSP-1(19) and PfMSP-3(11). The fusion protein induces a protective immune response with human-compatible adjuvants and may form a part of a multicomponent malaria vaccine.",M1
19930613,"Cellular responses to modified Plasmodium falciparum MSP119 antigens in individuals previously exposed to natural <e>malaria</e> infection.BACKGROUND: MSP1 processing-inhibitory antibodies bind to epitopes on the 19 kDa C-terminal region of the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1(19)), inhibiting erythrocyte invasion. Blocking antibodies also bind to this antigen but prevent inhibitory antibodies binding, allowing invasion to proceed. Recombinant MSP1(19) had been modified previously to allow inhibitory but not blocking antibodies to continue to bind. Immunization with these modified proteins, therefore, has the potential to induce more effective protective antibodies. However, it was unclear whether the modification of MSP1(19) would affect critical T-cell responses to epitopes in this antigen. METHODS: The cellular responses to wild-type MSP1(19) and a panel of modified MSP1(19) antigens were measured using an in-vitro assay for two groups of individuals: the first were malaria-naïve and the second had been naturally exposed to Plasmodium falciparum infection. The cellular responses to the modified proteins were examined using cells from malaria-exposed infants and adults. RESULTS: Interestingly, stimulation indices (SI) for responses induced by some of the modified proteins were at least two-fold higher than those elicited by the wild-type MSP1(19). A protein with four amino acid substitutions (Glu27--&gt;Tyr, Leu31--&gt;Arg, Tyr34--&gt;Ser and Glu43--&gt;Leu) had the highest stimulation index (SI up to 360) and induced large responses in 64% of the samples that had significant cellular responses to the modified proteins. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that specific MSP1(19) variants that have been engineered to improve their antigenicity for inhibitory antibodies, retain T-cell epitopes and the ability to induce cellular responses. These proteins are candidates for the development of MSP1-based malaria vaccines.",M1

A novel ultrasonic atomization approach for the formulation of biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles of malaria DNA vaccines encoding MSP1(19) is presented here. After condensing the plasmid DNA (pDNA) molecules with a cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI), a 40 kHz ultrasonic atomization frequency was used to formulate PLGA microparticles at a flow rate of 18 mL h(-1). High levels of gene expression and moderate cytotoxicity in COS-7 cells were achieved with the condensed pDNA at a nitrogen to phosphate (N/P) ratio of 20, thus demonstrating enhanced cellular uptake and expression of the transgene. The ability of the microparticles to convey pDNA was examined by characterizing the formulated microparticles. The microparticles displayed Z-average hydrodynamic diameters of 1.50-2.10 microm and zeta potentials of 17.8-23.2 mV. The encapsulation efficiencies were between 78 and 83%, and 76 and 85% of the embedded malaria pDNA molecules were released under physiological conditions in vitro.

This disease is re-emerging mainly due to the development of drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. Therefore, we are now forced to resort to remedy through vaccination. Until now, not even a single licensed malaria vaccine has been developed despite intensive efforts. Even the efficacy of RTS,S, the most advanced and promising vaccine candidate in the pipeline of malaria vaccine development, was only around 50% based on a number of clinical trials. These facts urge malaria researchers to urgently enrich this pipeline, as much as possible, with potential vaccine candidates. With the availability of malaria genome database, the enrichment of this pipeline is possible if we could now employ an efficient protein expression technology to decode the malaria genomic data, without any codon optimization, into quality recombinant proteins. Then, these synthesized recombinant proteins can be characterized and screened for discovering novel potential vaccine targets. The wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system will be a promising tool to this end. This review highlights the recent successes in synthesizing quality malaria proteins using this tool.",M1
19884337,"Toward the rational design of a <e>malaria</e> vaccine construct using the MSP3 family as an example: contribution of antigenicity studies in humans.Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein (MSP3) is a main target of protective immunity against malaria that is currently undergoing vaccine development. It was shown recently to belong, together with MSP6, to a new multigene family whose C-terminal regions have a similar organization, contain both homologous and divergent regions, and are highly conserved across isolates. In an attempt to rationally design novel vaccine constructs, we extended the analysis of antigenicity and function of region-specific antibodies, previously performed with MSP3 and MSP6, to the remaining four proteins of the MSP3 family using four recombinant proteins and 24 synthetic peptides. Antibodies to each MSP3 family antigen were found to be highly prevalent among malaria-exposed individuals from the village of Dielmo (Senegal). Each of the 24 peptides was antigenic, defining at least one epitope mimicking that of the native proteins, with a distinct IgG isotype pattern for each, although with an overall predominance of the IgG3 subclass. Human antibodies affinity purified upon each of the 24 peptides exerted an antiparasite antibody-dependent cellular inhibition effect, which in most cases was as strong as that of IgG from protected African adults. The two regions with high homology were found to generate a broad network of cross-reactive antibodies with various avidities. A first multigenic construct was designed using these findings and those from related immunogenicity studies in mice and demonstrated valuable immunological properties. These results indicate that numerous regions from the MSP3 family play a role in protection and provide a rationale for the tailoring of new MSP3-derived malaria vaccines.",M1

Here, we have extended this finding to human Plasmodium falciparum genes, evaluating the immune enhancing effect of Vaxfectin formulation on a mixture, designated CSLAM, of five plasmid DNA vaccines encoding antigens from the sporozoite (PfCSP, PfSSP2/TRAP), intrahepatic (PfLSA1), and erythrocytic (PfAMA1, PfMSP1) life cycle stages of P. falciparum administered at 2, 10 or 50microg doses. Vaxfectin formulation enhanced both antibody and cellular immune responses to each component of the multi-antigen vaccine mixture, as assessed by ELISA, IFAT, and IFN-gamma ELIspot, respectively. There was no apparent antigenic competition, as indicated by comparison of responses induced in mice immunized with PfCSP vs. CSLAM.

19874576,"The <e>malaria</e> candidate vaccine liver stage antigen-3 is highly conserved in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from diverse geographical areas.BACKGROUND: A high level of genetic stability has been formerly identified in segments of the gene coding for the liver stage antigen-3 (LSA-3), a subunit vaccine candidate against Plasmodium falciparum. The exploration of lsa-3 polymorphisms was extended to the whole sequence of this large antigen in 20 clinical isolates from four geographical areas; Senegal, Comoro islands, Brazil and Thailand. METHODS: The whole 4680 bp genomic sequence of lsa-3 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The clinical isolate sequences were aligned on the sequence of the laboratory reference P. falciparum strain 3D7. RESULTS: The non-repeated sequence of lsa-3 was very well conserved with only a few allelic variations scattered along the sequence. Interestingly, a formerly identified immunodominant region, employed for the majority of pre-clinical vaccine development, was totally conserved at the genetic level. The most significant variations observed were in the number and organization of tetrapeptide repeated units, but not in their composition, resulting in different lengths of these repeated regions. The shorter repeated regions were from Brazilian origin. A correlation between the geographical distribution of the parasites with single nucleotide polymorphisms was not detected. CONCLUSION: The lack of correlation between allelic polymorphisms with a specific transmission pressure suggests that LSA-3 is a structurally constrained molecule. The unusual characteristics of the lsa-3 gene make the molecule an interesting candidate for a subunit vaccine against malaria.",M1
19859562,"The quantity and quality of African children's IgG responses to merozoite surface antigens reflect protection against Plasmodium falciparum <e>malaria</e>.BACKGROUND: Antibodies, particularly cytophilic IgG subclasses, with specificity for asexual blood stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum, are thought to play an important role in acquired immunity to malaria. Evaluating such responses in longitudinal sero-epidemiological field studies, allied to increasing knowledge of the immunological mechanisms associated with anti-malarial protection, will help in the development of malaria vaccines. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a 1-year follow-up study of 305 Senegalese children and identified those resistant or susceptible to malaria. In retrospective analyses we then compared post-follow-up IgG responses to six asexual-stage candidate malaria vaccine antigens in groups of individuals with clearly defined clinical and parasitological histories of infection with P. falciparum. In age-adjusted analyses, children resistant to malaria as well as to high-density parasitemia, had significantly higher IgG1 responses to GLURP and IgG3 responses to MSP2 than their susceptible counterparts. Among those resistant to malaria, high anti-MSP1 IgG1 levels were associated with protection against high-density parasitemia. To assess functional attributes, we used an in vitro parasite growth inhibition assay with purified IgG. Samples from individuals with high levels of IgG directed to MSP1, MSP2 and AMA1 gave the strongest parasite growth inhibition, but a marked age-related decline was observed in these effects. CONCLUSION: Our data are consistent with the idea that protection against P. falciparum malaria in children depends on acquisition of a constellation of appropriate, functionally active IgG subclass responses directed to multiple asexual stage antigens. Our results suggest at least two distinct mechanisms via which antibodies may exert protective effects. Although declining with age, the growth inhibitory effects of purified IgG measurable in vitro reflected levels of anti-AMA1, -MSP1 and -MSP2, but not of anti-GLURP IgG. The latter could act on parasite growth via indirect parasiticidal pathways.",M1
19859560,"A randomized trial assessing the safety and immunogenicity of AS01 and AS02 adjuvanted RTS,S <e>malaria</e> vaccine candidates in children in Gabon.BACKGROUND: The malaria vaccine candidate antigen RTS,S includes parts of the pre-erythrocytic stage circumsporozoite protein fused to the Hepatitis B surface antigen. Two Adjuvant Systems are in development for this vaccine, an oil-in water emulsion--based formulation (AS02) and a formulation based on liposomes (AS01). METHODS &amp; PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this Phase II, double-blind study (NCT00307021), 180 healthy Gabonese children aged 18 months to 4 years were randomized to receive either RTS,S/AS01(E) or RTS,S/AS02(D), on a 0-1-2 month vaccination schedule. The children were followed-up daily for six days after each vaccination and monthly for 14 months. Blood samples were collected at 4 time-points. Both vaccines were well tolerated. Safety parameters were distributed similarly between the two groups. Both vaccines elicited a strong specific immune response after Doses 2 and 3 with a ratio of anti-CS GMT titers (AS02(D)/AS01(E)) of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.68-1.15) post-Dose 3. After Doses 2 and 3 of experimental vaccines, anti-CS and anti-HBs antibody GMTs were higher in children who had been previously vaccinated with at least one dose of hepatitis B vaccine compared to those not previously vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: RTS,S/AS01(E) proved similarly as well tolerated and immunogenic as RTS,S/AS02(D), completing an essential step in the age de-escalation process within the RTS,S clinical development plan.

19858306,"Prime-boost immunization with adenoviral and modified vaccinia virus Ankara vectors enhances the durability and polyfunctionality of protective <e>malaria</e> CD8+ T-cell responses.Protection against liver-stage malaria relies on the induction of high frequencies of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. We have previously reported high protective levels against mouse malaria, albeit short-lived, by a single vaccination with adenoviral vectors coding for a liver-stage antigen (ME.TRAP). Here, we report that prime-boost regimens using modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and adenoviral vectors encoding ME.TRAP can enhance both short- and long-term sterile protection against malaria. Protection persisted for at least 6 months when simian adenoviruses AdCh63 and AdC9 were used as priming vectors. Kinetic analysis showed that the MVA boost made the adenoviral-primed T cells markedly more polyfunctional, with the number of gamma interferon (INF-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) triple-positive and INF-gamma and TNF-alpha double-positive cells increasing over time, while INF-gamma single-positive cells declined with time. However, IFN-gamma production prevailed as the main immune correlate of protection, while neither an increase of polyfunctionality nor a high integrated mean fluorescence intensity (iMFI) correlated with protection. These data highlight the ability of optimized viral vector prime-boost regimens to generate more protective and sustained CD8+ T-cell responses, and our results encourage a more nuanced assessment of the importance of inducing polyfunctional CD8(+) T cells by vaccination.",M1
19857448,"Evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1, merozoite surface protein 1 or RTS,S vaccines with adjuvant system AS02A administered alone or concurrently in rhesus monkeys.In an effort to broaden the immune response induced by the RTS,S/AS02(A),vaccine, we have evaluated the immunogenicity of the RTS,S antigen when combined with MSP1(42) and with AMA1, antigens derived from the asexual blood stage. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine whether MSP1(42) and AMA1 vaccines formulated with the AS02(A) Adjuvant System were safe and immunogenic in the rhesus monkey model; (ii) to investigate whether MSP1(42) or AMA1 induced immune interference to each other, or to RTS,S, when added singly or in combinations at a single injection site; (iii) in the event of immune interference, to determine if this could be reduced when antigens were administered at separate sites. We found that MSP1(42) and AMA1 were safe and immunogenic, eliciting antibodies, and Th1 and Th2 responses using IFN-gamma and IL-5 as markers. When <e>malaria</e> antigens were delivered together in one formulation, MSP1(42) and RTS,S reduced AMA1-specific antibody responses as measured by ELISA however, only MSP1(42) lowered parasite growth inhibitory activity of anti-AMA1 antibodies as measured by in vitro growth inhibition assay. Unlike RTS,S, MSP1(42) significantly reduced AMA1 IFN-gamma and IL-5 responses. MSP1(42) suppression of AMA1 IFN-gamma responses was not seen in animals receiving RTS,S+AMA1+MSP1(42) suggesting that RTS,S restored IFN-gamma responses. Conversely, AMA1 had no effect on MSP1(42) antibody and IFN-gamma and IL-5 responses. Neither AMA1 alone or combined with MSP1(42) affected RTS,S antibody or IFN-gamma and IL-5 responses. Immune interference by MSP1(42) on AMA1 antibody responses was also evident when AMA1, MSP1(42) and RTS,S were administered concurrently at separate sites. These results suggest that immune interference may be complex and should be considered for the design of multi-antigen, multi-stage vaccines against malaria.",M1
19838068,"Genetically engineered, attenuated whole-cell vaccine approaches for <e>malaria</e>.Malaria remains one of the most significant infectious diseases affecting human populations in developing countries. The quest for an efficacious malaria vaccine has been ongoing for nearly a century with limited success. The identification of malaria parasite antigens focused efforts on the development of subunit vaccines but has so far yielded only one partially efficacious vaccine candidate, RTS/S. The lack of high vaccine efficacy observed to date with subunit vaccine candidates raises doubts that the development of a single antigen or even a multi-antigen malaria subunit vaccine is possible. Fortunately, it has been demonstrated in animal studies and experimental clinical studies that immunizations with live-attenuated sporozoite stages of the malaria parasite confer long lasting, sterile protection against infection, providing a benchmark for vaccine development. These early successful vaccinations with live-attenuated malaria parasites did not however, promote a developmental path forward for such a vaccine approach. The discovery of genetically engineered parasite strains that are fully attenuated during the early asymptomatic liver infection and confer complete sterile protection in animal malaria models support the development of a live attenuated sporozoite vaccine for Plasmodium falciparum and its accelerated safety and efficacy testing in malaria challenge models and in malaria endemic areas.",M1

The pv34 gene product was characterized by molecular biology and immunological techniques. Additionally, association of Pv34 to detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs), expression in late blood-stage parasites and recognition of recombinant Pv34 (rPv34) by sera from P. vivax-infected Aotus monkeys and patients was assessed.

19837090,"Comparing human T cell and NK cell responses in viral-based <e>malaria</e> vaccine trials.Vaccination with viral-based vaccines continues to hold promise for the prevention of malaria. Whilst antigen-specific T cell responses are considered a major aim of such an approach, a role for induced NK cells as anti-malarial effector cells, or in shaping T cell responses, has received less attention. In this study naïve human volunteers were vaccinated in a prime-boost vaccination regimen comprising recombinant viral vectors fowlpox (FP9) and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) encoding liver-stage antigens, or a virosome vaccine. Significant T cell responses specific for the vectored vaccine antigens were demonstrated by IFNgamma ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for IFNgamma and IL-2, the ICS being associated with increased time to parasitaemia following subsequent challenge. Numbers of CD56(bright) lymphocytes increased significantly following vaccination, as did CD3(+) CD56(+) lymphocytes, whilst CD56(dim) cells did not. No such increases were seen with the virosome vaccine. There was no significant correlation of these CD56(+) populations with the antigen-specific T cell responses nor time to parasitaemia. To investigate pathways of immune activation that could contribute to these lymphocyte responses, viral vectors were shown in vitro to efficiently infect APCs but not lymphocytes, and stimulated inflammatory cytokines such as type I interferons. In conclusion, measuring antigen-specific T cells is more meaningful than NK cells in these vaccination regimens.",M1
19823032,"The role of Plasmodium falciparum variant surface antigens in protective immunity and vaccine development.There is substantial immuno-epidemiological evidence that the parasite-encoded, so-called variant surface antigens (VSAs), such as PfEMP1 on the surface of infected erythrocytes (IEs) are important-in some cases probably decisive determinants of clinical outcome of P. falciparum <e>malaria</e>. The evidence is increasingly being underpinned by specific molecular understanding of the pathogenic processes involved. Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) caused by placenta-sequestering IEs expressing the PfEMP1 variant VAR2CSA is a particularly striking example of this. These findings have raised hopes that development of PfEMP1-based vaccines to protect specifically against severe malaria syndromes-in particular PAM-is feasible. This review summarizes the evidence that VSAs are important targets of NAI, discusses why VSA-based vaccines might be feasible despite the extensive intra- and interclonal variation of VSAs, and how vaccines based on this type of antigens fit into the current global strategy to reduce, eliminate and eventually eradicate the burden of malaria.",M1
19806184,"Randomized controlled trial of RTS,S/AS02D and RTS,S/AS01E <e>malaria</e> candidate vaccines given according to different schedules in Ghanaian children.BACKGROUND: The target delivery channel of RTS,S candidate malaria vaccines in malaria-endemic countries in Africa is the World Health Organisation Expanded Program on Immunization. As an Adjuvant System, age de-escalation and schedule selection step, this study assessed 3 schedules of RTS,S/AS01(E) and RTS,S/AS02(D) in infants and young children 5-17 months of age in Ghana. METHODOLOGY: A Phase II, partially-blind randomized controlled study (blind to vaccine, not to schedule), of 19 months duration was conducted in two (2) centres in Ghana between August 2006 and May 2008. Subjects were allocated randomly (1:1:1:1:1:1) to one of six study groups at each study site, each defining which vaccine should be given and by which schedule (0,1-, 0,1,2- or 0,1,7-months). For the 0,1,2-month schedule participants received RTS,S/AS01(E) or rabies vaccine at one center and RTS,S/AS01(E) or RTS,S/AS02(D) at the other. For the other schedules at both study sites, they received RTS,S/AS01(E) or RTS,S/AS02(D). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of serious adverse events until 10 months post dose 1. RESULTS: The number of serious adverse events reported across groups was balanced. One child had a simple febrile convulsion, which evolved favourably without sequelae, considered to be related to RTS,S/AS01(E) vaccination. Low grade reactions occurred slightly more frequently in recipients of RTS,S/AS than rabies vaccines; grade 3 reactions were infrequent. Less local reactogenicity occurred with RTS,S/AS01(E) than RTS,S/AS02(D). Both candidate vaccines were highly immunogenic for anti-circumsporozoite and anti-Hepatitis B Virus surface antigen antibodies. Recipients of RTS,S/AS01(E) compared to RTS,S/AS02(D) had higher peak anti-circumsporozoite antibody responses for all 3 schedules. Three dose schedules were more immunogenic than 2 dose schedules. Area under the curve analyses for anti-circumsporozoite antibodies were comparable between the 0,1,2- and 0,1,7-month RTS,S/AS01(E) schedules. CONCLUSIONS: Both candidate malaria vaccines were well tolerated. Anti-circumsporozoite responses were greater with RTS,S/AS01(E) than RTS,S/AS02(D) and when 3 rather than 2 doses were given. This study supports the selection of RTS,S/AS01(E) and a 3 dose schedule for further development in children and infants. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00360230.",M1
19806009,"From the circumsporozoite protein to the RTS, S/AS candidate vaccine.The RTS,S/AS01(E) <e>malaria</e> vaccine candidate has recently entered Phase 3 testing. Reaching this important milestone is the culmination of more than 20 years of research and development by GlaxoSmithKline and partners and collaborators. The vaccine has been developed to protect young children and infants living in Sub-Saharan Africa against clinical and severe disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum infection. Over the past 9 years, RTS,S/AS has been evaluated in multiple Phase 2 studies. The vaccine was shown to have a favorable safety profile and to be well tolerated in all age groups in which it was tested, including the intended target population of infants and young children in Sub-Saharan Africa. Data obtained so far suggest that RTS,S/AS can be co-administered with other vaccines included in the routine Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI). In Phase 2 testing, the vaccine candidate was shown to confer significant protection against P. falciparum infection and clinical disease, including severe malaria. Furthermore, a trend towards an indirect beneficial effect of the vaccine on non-malarial morbidities has been observed in several trials. In this paper, we will describe the genesis of the RTS,S/AS concept, including the rationale for selecting the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) as the target antigen. Early development history of the vaccine will be briefly described. We will present the most salient results from recent Phase 2 studies conducted in the target pediatric population, which have led to the decision to progress RTS,S/AS to Phase 3 testing. If the Phase 3 results confirm the observations made during Phase 2 testing, the RTS,S/AS vaccine, when broadly implemented and judiciously integrated with other malaria-prevention measures, would have a major public-health impact in Sub-Saharan Africa.",M1
19798415,"The synthetic Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite peptide PfCS102 as a <e>malaria</e> vaccine candidate: a randomized controlled phase I trial.BACKGROUND: Fully efficient vaccines against malaria pre-erythrocytic stage are still lacking. The objective of this dose/adjuvant-finding study was to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate based on a peptide spanning the C-terminal region of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCS102) in malaria naive adults. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thirty-six healthy malaria-naive adults were randomly distributed into three dose blocks (10, 30 and 100 microg) and vaccinated with PfCS102 in combination with either Montanide ISA 720 or GSK proprietary Adjuvant System AS02A at days 0, 60, and 180. Primary end-point (safety and reactogenicity) was based on the frequency of adverse events (AE) and of abnormal biological safety tests; secondary-end point (immunogenicity) on P. falciparum specific cell-mediated immunity and antibody response before and after immunization. The two adjuvant formulations were well tolerated and their safety profile was good. Most AEs were local and, when systemic, involved mainly fatigue and headache. Half the volunteers in AS02A groups experienced severe AEs (mainly erythema). After the third injection, 34 of 35 volunteers developed anti-PfCS102 and anti-sporozoite antibodies, and 28 of 35 demonstrated T-cell proliferative responses and IFN-gamma production. Five of 22 HLA-A2 and HLA-A3 volunteers displayed PfCS102 specific IFN-gamma secreting CD8(+) T cell responses. Responses were only marginally boosted after the 3(rd) vaccination and remained stable for 6 months. For both adjuvants, the dose of 10 microg was less immunogenic in comparison to 30 and 100 microg that induced similar responses. AS02A formulations with 30 microg or 100 microg PfCS102 induced about 10-folds higher antibody and IFN-gamma responses than Montanide formulations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: PfCS102 peptide was safe and highly immunogenic, allowing the design of more advanced trials to test its potential for protection. Two or three immunizations with a dose of 30 microg formulated with AS02A appeared the most appropriate choice for such studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Swissmedic.ch 2002 DR 1227.",M1

Within the predicted open reading frame of P. falciparum hypothetical protein PFF0165c, several segments with low hydrophobic amino acid content, which are likely to be intrinsically unstructured, were identified. The synthetic peptide corresponding to one such segment (P27A) was well recognized by sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of adults living in different regions where malaria is endemic. High antibody titers were induced in different strains of mice and in rabbits immunized with the polypeptide formulated with different adjuvants. These antibodies recognized native epitopes in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes, formed distinct bands in Western blots, and were inhibitory in an in vitro antibody-dependent cellular inhibition parasite-growth assay. The immunological properties of P27A, together with its low polymorphism and association with clinical protection from malaria in humans, warrant its further development as a malaria vaccine candidate.",M1

Despite the theoretical benefits of such production, expression of parasite antigens in plants, particularly those from Plasmodium, the causative parasites for <e>malaria</e>, have achieved only limited success. We have previously shown that stable transformation of tobacco plants with a plant-codon optimized form of the Plasmodium yoelii merozoite surface protein 4/5 (PyMSP4/5) gene resulted in PyMSP4/5 expression of up to approximately 0.25% of total soluble protein. In this report, we describe the rapid expression of PyMSP4/5 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves using the deconstructed tobacco mosaic virus-based magnICON expression system. PyMSP4/5 yields of up to 10% TSP or 1-2 mg/g of fresh weight were consistently achieved. Characterization of the recombinant plant-made PyMSP4/5 indicates that it is structurally similar to PyMSP4/5 expressed by Escherichia coli. It is notable that the plant-made PyMSP4/5 protein retained its immunogenicity following long-term storage at ambient temperature within freeze-dried leaves. With assistance from a mucosal adjuvant the PyMSP4/5-containing leaves induced PyMSP4/5-specific antibodies when delivered orally to naïve mice or mice primed by a DNA vaccine. This study provides evidence that immunogenic Plasmodium antigens can be produced in large quantities in plants using the magnICON viral vector system.",M1

To identify the target antigen of M26-32, a P. falciparum Dd2 asexual stage cDNA expression library was screened with this antibody, and a full open reading frame cDNA was obtained. This gene, named pfmag-1, encodes a polypeptide of 589 amino acids. The protein PfMAg-1 was characterized as a membrane-associated protein that expressed on the surface of merozoite during erythrocytic stage. Remarkably, at the C terminus of PfMAg-1, there are 14 copies of a deca-peptide sequence of QTDEIKND (H/N) I. This tandem repeat domain was identified to harbor the epitope of the protective M26-32 monoclonal antibody, and was also recognized by sera of patients infected with P. falciparum.

We synthesized, as 20-mer long peptides, the members of the ring exported (REX) protein family encoded in chromosome 9, as well as the early transcribed membrane proteins (E-TRAMP) 10.2 and 4, to identify specific RBC binding regions in these proteins. Twelve binding peptides were identified (designated as HABPs): three were identified in REX1, two in REX2, one in REX3, two in REX4 and four in E-TRAMP 10.2. The majority of these HABPs was conserved among different P. falciparum strains, according to sequence analysis. No HABPs were found in E-TRAMP 4. Bindings of HABPs were saturable and sensitive to the enzymatic treatment of RBCs and HABPs had different structural features, according to circular dichroism studies. Our results suggest that the REX and E-TRAMP families participate in relevant interactions with RBC membrane proteins, which highlight these proteins as potential targets for the development of fully effective immunoprophylactic methods.",M1

19727400,"Construction of transgenic Plasmodium berghei as a model for evaluation of blood-stage vaccine candidate of Plasmodium falciparum chimeric protein 2.9.BACKGROUND: The function of the 19 kDa C-terminal region of the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1-19) expressed by Plasmodium has been demonstrated to be conserved across distantly related Plasmodium species. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a reporter protein that has been widely used because it can be easily detected in living organisms by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: In this study, we used gene targeting to generate transgenic P. berghei (Pb) parasites (designated as PfMSP1-19Pb) that express the MSP1-19 of P. falciparum (Pf) and the GFP reporter protein simultaneously. The replacement of the PbMSP1-19 locus by PfMSP1-19 was verified by PCR and Southern analysis. The expression of the chimeric PbfMSP-1 and the GFP was verified by Western blot and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Moreover, GFP-expressing transgenic parasites in blood stages can be readily differentiated from other blood cells using flow cytometry. A comparison of growth rates between wild-type and the PfMSP1-19Pb transgenic parasite indicated that the replacement of the MSP1-19 region and the expression of the GFP protein were not deleterious to the transgenic parasites. We used this transgenic mouse parasite as a murine model to evaluate the protective efficacy in vivo of specific IgG elicited by a PfCP-2.9 <e>malaria</e> vaccine that contains the PfMSP1-19. The BALB/c mice passively transferred with purified rabbit IgG to the PfCP-2.9 survived a lethal challenge of the PfMSP1-19Pb transgenic murine parasites, but not the wild-type P. berghei whereas the control mice passively transferred with purified IgG obtained from adjuvant only-immunized rabbits were vulnerable to both transgenic and wild-type infections. CONCLUSIONS: We generated a transgenic P. berghei line that expresses PfMSP1-19 and the GFP reporter gene simultaneously. The availability of this parasite line provides a murine model to evaluate the protective efficacy in vivo of anti-MSP1-19 antibodies, including, potentially, those elicited by the PfCP-2.9 malaria vaccine in human volunteers.",M1

19691557,"Antigens for pre-erythrocytic <e>malaria</e> vaccines: building on success.Immunization with attenuated pre-erythrocytic malaria parasites can confer sterile protection against malaria in humans and rodents, and a single pre-erythrocytic antigen incorporated in a subunit vaccine has substantially reduced clinical Plasmodium falciparum malaria episodes in African infants during phase 2 trials. Building upon this success has been hindered by technical obstacles that limit research on pre-erythrocytic parasites, especially the liver stage (LS) parasites, and by an incomplete understanding of the immune mechanisms that confer protection in humans. Recent improvements in growing and isolating LS parasites have allowed progress in defining the transcriptome and proteome of the LS parasite, although more work remains to be done particularly for the early LS parasite of P. falciparum. Next generation pre-erythrocytic antigens can be assessed and prioritized based on immunization studies in animals, and on models of immunity such as attenuated parasite vaccines that confer sterile protection or naturally acquired LS-specific immune responses that correlate with protection in endemic areas. Although mechanisms of protection in humans remain poorly understood, the availability of a human malaria challenge model for early clinical testing of candidate vaccines is a valuable tool to confirm which immunogens should move forward to larger field trials.",M1
19689738,"The relationship between human effector and memory T cells measured by ex vivo and cultured ELISPOT following recent and distal priming.Maintenance of T-cell responses is an essential feature in protection from many infectious diseases that must be harnessed in vaccination. The relationship between effector T-cell responses and more durable and highly proliferative T-cell memory, particularly in humans, is not well understood. In this study, effector T-cell responses were measured by overnight ex vivo interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot-forming cell assay (ELISPOT), whereas memory T cells were measured by 10-day culture followed by IFN-gamma ELISPOT (cultured ELISPOT). We observed a significant correlation between IFN-gamma responses to CD4-stimulatory, but not to CD8-stimulatory, recall antigens measured by these assays, suggesting a divergence in regulation. In vaccine trial participants who received a prime-boost vaccination regimen comprising <e>malaria</e> antigens delivered by poxviruses, there was a correlation between ex vivo and cultured responses on day 7, but not 3 months post-vaccination, with the ratio of cultured : ex vivo response increasing over time. To compare responses revealed by cultured ELISPOT in more detail, tetramers comprising viral recall antigens were used to ascribe effector-memory and central-memory T-cell phenotypes through CCR7 and CD62L costaining. For CD8(+) responses the effector phenotype decreased during the initial culture period and memory populations remained high within the resulting 20-fold to 50-fold increased IFN-gamma-secreting or tetramer(+) population. This was less marked for CD4(+) responses, which had higher starting memory phenotype. Depletion of these central-memory T-cell populations generally ablated responses in cultured ELISPOT and reduced ex vivo responses. This study highlights differences between CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector and memory T cells, and the more complex phenotype of CD4(+) T cells.",M1

The result indicates high potential of gel core liposomes for their use as a carrier adjuvant for intramuscular delivery of recombinant antigen Pfs25 based transmission blocking malaria vaccine.",M1
19686691,"Evaluation of a prime-boost vaccine schedule with distinct adenovirus vectors against <e>malaria</e> in rhesus monkeys.A vaccine that elicits both specific antibodies and IFN-gamma-producing T cells is required to protect against pre-erythrocytic malaria. Among the most promising approaches to induce such complex immunity are heterologous prime-boost vaccination regimens, in particular ones containing live viral vector. We have demonstrated previously that adenovectors serotype 35 (Ads35) encoding the circumsporozoite (CS) antigen or liver-stage antigen-1 (LSA-1) are highly effective in improving the T-cell responses induced by immunizations with protein-based vaccines in a heterologous prime-boost schedule. Here we evaluated the potential of a heterologous prime-boost vaccination that combines the Ad35.CS vector with the serologically distinct adenovector Ad5.CS, in rhesus macaques, after establishing the potency in mice. We show that the heterologous Ad35.CS/Ad5.CS prime-boost regimen elicits both antibody responses and robust IFN-gamma-producing CD8(+) T-cell responses against the CS antigen. Analysis of the quality of the antibody responses in rhesus macaques, using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with Plasmodium falciparum-coated slides, demonstrated that this heterologous prime-boost regimen elicits a high titer of antibodies that are able to bind to P. falciparum sporozoites. Level of the IFA response was superior to the response measured with sera of an adult human population living in endemic malaria region. In conclusion, the combination of Ad35.CS, a vaccine based on a rare serotype adenovirus, with Ad5.CS or possibly another adenovector of a distinct serotype, induces a complex immune response that is required for protection against malaria, and is thus a highly promising approach for pediatric vaccination.",M1

19660590,"Use of o-phthalaldehyde assay to determine protein contents of Alhydrogel-based vaccines.Aluminum based adjuvants (alum), including aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel) and aluminum phosphate are the most commonly used adjuvant in the US. In order to ensure quality of vaccines, regulatory authorities require evaluation of antigen content in final vaccine products. Currently, there are no generic methods available for the determination of protein content in alum-based vaccines. Aluminum hydroxide gels exist as particles in solution, which interfere with direct quantitation of protein content in formulations using assays such as Lowry, BCA or Bradford protein assay. The present study adapts a simple fluorescent assay to directly (without the need for antigen extraction) determine antigen content on Alhydrogel with accuracy and sensitivity using the o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent. <e>Malaria</e> vaccine candidates AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel, AMA1-C2/Alhydrogel, MSP1(42)-3D7/Alhydrogel, MSP1(42)-C1/Alhydrogel or BSAM-2/Alhydrogel were used as model formulations. The results of the present study show that the OPA assay is highly accurate (87-100%), reproducible, and simple with a linear detection range of 25-400 microg/mL for Alhydrogel vaccines (except for MSP1(42)-C1, which has a linear detection range of 31.25-500 microg/mL).

19658096,"Multiple functions of human T cells generated by experimental <e>malaria</e> challenge.Protective immunity generated following malaria infection may be comprised of Ab or T cells against malaria Ag of different stages; however, the short-lived immunity that is observed suggests deficiency in immune memory or regulatory activity. In this study, cellular immune responses were investigated in individuals receiving Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite challenge by the natural (mosquito bite) route as part of a malaria vaccine efficacy trial. Parasitemia, monitored by blood film microscopy and PCR, was subsequently cleared with drugs. All individuals demonstrated stable IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-4 ex vivo ELISPOT effector responses against P. falciparum-infected RBC (iRBC) Ag, 28 and 90 days after challenge. However, infected RBC-specific central memory responses, as measured by IFN-gamma cultured ELISPOT, were low and unstable over time, despite CD4(+) T cells being highly proliferative by CFSE dilution, and showed an inverse relationship to parasite density. In support of the observation of poor memory, co-culture experiments showed reduced responses to common recall Ag, indicating malaria-specific regulatory activity. This activity could not be accounted for by the expression of IL-10, TGF-beta, FOXP3 or CTLA-4, but proliferating T cells expressed high levels of CD95, indicating a pro-apoptotic phenotype. Lastly, there was an inverse relationship between FOXP3 expression, when measured 10 days after challenge, and ex vivo IFN-gamma measured more than 100 days later. This study shows that malaria infection elicits specific Th1 and Th2 effector cells, but concomitant weak central memory and regulatory activity, which may help to explain the short-lived immunity observed.",M1
19651872,"Plasmodium falciparum-specific cellular immune responses after immunization with the RTS,S/AS02D candidate <e>malaria</e> vaccine in infants living in an area of high endemicity in Mozambique.Results from clinical trials in areas where malaria is endemic have shown that immunization with RTS,S/AS02A malaria vaccine candidate induces partial protection in adults and children and cellular effector and memory responses in adults. For the first time in a malaria vaccine trial, we sought to assess the cell-mediated immune responses to RTS,S antigen components in infants under 1 year of age participating in a clinical phase I/IIb trial of RTS,S/AS02D in Mozambique. Circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific responses were detected in approximately half of RTS,S-immunized infants and included gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and combined IL-2/IL-4 responses. The median stimulation indices of cytokine-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells were very low but significantly higher in RTS,S-immunized infants than in infants that received the comparator vaccine. Protection against subsequent malarial infection tended to be associated with a higher percentage of individuals with CSP-specific IL-2 in the supernatant (P = 0.053) and with higher CSP-specific IFN-gamma-producing CD8(+) T-cell responses (P = 0.07). These results report for the first time the detection of malaria-specific cellular immune responses after vaccination of infants less than 1 year of age and pave the way for future field studies of cellular immunity to malaria vaccine candidates.",M1

Thirty eligible volunteers were randomized to receive either the MSP3-LSP candidate vaccine or tetanus toxoid vaccine as a control. A dose of each vaccine was administered on days 0, 28 and 112 and the vaccine was formulated with aluminium hydroxide. Humoral immune responses were assessed by ELISA at days 0, 28, 56, 112, 140, 252 and 365 and cell-mediated immune responses by lymphoproliferation assay and by ELISA on days 0, 56 and 140. IgG responses to four peptides of MSP3 were similar in both vaccine groups. Higher IgG concentrations were recorded after the beginning of malaria high transmission season in both vaccine groups. The lymphocyte proliferation and the production of IFN-gamma in response to stimulation with the four overlapping peptides increased following vaccination in the MSP3-LSP vaccine group, but did not change appreciably in the control group. In contrast to natural infection, MSP3-LSP did not boost humoral responses to the four overlapping peptides of MSP3 to any detectable degree in our semi-immune adult. MSP3-LSP may be more immunogenic in young children with little or no acquired immunity.",M1
19643205,"Nucleotide sequence polymorphism at the apical membrane antigen-1 locus reveals population history of Plasmodium vivax in Thailand.Apical membrane antigen-1 is a candidate for inclusion in a vaccine for the human <e>malaria</e> parasite Plasmodium vivax. We collected 231 complete sequences of the gene encoding this antigen (pvama-1) from three regions of Thailand, the most extensive collection to date of sequences at this locus. The domain II loop (previously mentioned as a potential vaccine component) was almost completely conserved, with a single amino acid variant (I313R) observed in a single sequence. The 3' portion of the gene (domain II through the stop codon) showed significantly lower nucleotide diversity than the 5' portion (start codon through domain I); and a given domain I sequence might be found in a haplotype with more than one domain II sequence. These results imply a hotspot of recombination between domains I and II. We found significant geographic subdivision among the three regions of Thailand (NW, East, and South) in which collections were made in 2007. Numbers of P. vivax infections have experienced overall declines since 1990 in all three regions; but the decline has been most recent in the NW, and there has been a rebound in numbers of infections in the South since 2000. Consistent with population history, amino acid sequence diversity was greatest in the NW. The South, which had by far the lowest sequence diversity of the three regions, showed signs of a population that has expanded from a small number of founders after a bottleneck.",M1

19641203,"Protection against a <e>malaria</e> challenge by sporozoite inoculation.BACKGROUND: An effective vaccine for malaria is urgently needed. Naturally acquired immunity to malaria develops slowly, and induction of protection in humans can be achieved artificially by the inoculation of radiation-attenuated sporozoites by means of more than 1000 infective mosquito bites. METHODS: We exposed 15 healthy volunteers--with 10 assigned to a vaccine group and 5 assigned to a control group--to bites of mosquitoes once a month for 3 months while they were receiving a prophylactic regimen of chloroquine. The vaccine group was exposed to mosquitoes that were infected with Plasmodium falciparum, and the control group was exposed to mosquitoes that were not infected with the malaria parasite. One month after the discontinuation of chloroquine, protection was assessed by homologous challenge with five mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum. We assessed humoral and cellular responses before vaccination and before the challenge to investigate correlates of protection. RESULTS: All 10 subjects in the vaccine group were protected against a malaria challenge with the infected mosquitoes. In contrast, patent parasitemia (i.e., parasites found in the blood on microscopical examination) developed in all five control subjects. Adverse events were mainly reported by vaccinees after the first immunization and by control subjects after the challenge; no serious adverse events occurred. In this model, we identified the induction of parasite-specific pluripotent effector memory T cells producing interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-2 as a promising immunologic marker of protection. CONCLUSIONS: Protection against a homologous malaria challenge can be induced by the inoculation of intact sporozoites. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00442377.)",M1

19633296,"Structure of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, a leading <e>malaria</e> vaccine candidate.The Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is critical for sporozoite function and invasion of hepatocytes. Given its critical nature, a phase III human CSP malaria vaccine trial is ongoing. The CSP is composed of three regions as follows: an N terminus that binds heparin sulfate proteoglycans, a four amino acid repeat region (NANP), and a C terminus that contains a thrombospondin-like type I repeat (TSR) domain. Despite the importance of CSP, little is known about its structure. Therefore, recombinant forms of CSP were produced by expression in both Escherichia coli (Ec) and then refolded (EcCSP) or in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (PpCSP) for structural analyses. To analyze the TSR domain of recombinant CSP, conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies that recognized unfixed P. falciparum sporozoites and inhibited sporozoite invasion of HepG2 cells in vitro were identified. These monoclonal antibodies recognized all recombinant CSPs, indicating the recombinant CSPs contain a properly folded TSR domain structure. Characterization of both EcCSP and PpCSP by dynamic light scattering and velocity sedimentation demonstrated that both forms of CSP appeared as highly extended proteins (R(h) 4.2 and 4.58 nm, respectively). Furthermore, high resolution atomic force microscopy revealed flexible, rod-like structures with a ribbon-like appearance. Using this information, we modeled the NANP repeat and TSR domain of CSP. Consistent with the biochemical and biophysical results, the repeat region formed a rod-like structure about 21-25 nm in length and 1.5 nm in width. Thus native CSP appears as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, flexible rod-like protein on the sporozoite surface.",M1

19625622,"Preerythrocytic, live-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidates by design.Falciparum <e>malaria</e> is initiated when Anopheles mosquitoes transmit the Plasmodium sporozoite stage during a blood meal. Irradiated sporozoites confer sterile protection against subsequent malaria infection in animal models and humans. This level of protection is unmatched by current recombinant malaria vaccines. However, the live-attenuated vaccine approach faces formidable obstacles, including development of accurate, reproducible attenuation techniques. We tested whether Plasmodium falciparum could be attenuated at the early liver stage by genetic engineering. The P. falciparum genetically attenuated parasites (GAPs) harbor individual deletions or simultaneous deletions of the sporozoite-expressed genes P52 and P36. Gene deletions were done by double-cross-over recombination to avoid genetic reversion of the knockout parasites. The gene deletions did not affect parasite replication throughout the erythrocytic cycle, gametocyte production, mosquito infections, and sporozoite production rates. However, the deletions caused parasite developmental arrest during hepatocyte infection. The double-gene deletion line exhibited a more severe intrahepatocytic growth defect compared with the single-gene deletion lines, and it did not persist. This defect was assessed in an in vitro liver-stage growth assay and in a chimeric mouse model harboring human hepatocytes. The strong phenotype of the double knockout GAP justifies its human testing as a whole-organism vaccine candidate using the established sporozoite challenge model. GAPs might provide a safe and reproducible platform to develop an efficacious whole-cell malaria vaccine that prevents infection at the preerythrocytic stage.",M1
19623257,"A potent <e>malaria</e> transmission blocking vaccine based on codon harmonized full length Pfs48/45 expressed in Escherichia coli.Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for nearly 1 million deaths annually. Although much progress has been made in the recent past, the development of a safe, effective and affordable malaria vaccine has remained a challenge. A vaccine targeting sexual stages of the parasite will not only reduce malaria transmission by female Anopheles mosquitoes, but also reduce the spread of parasites able to evade immunity elicited by vaccines targeting pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic asexual stages. We focused our studies on Pfs48/45, a protein expressed in the sexual stages developing within an infected person and one of the most promising transmission-blocking vaccine targets. Functional immunogenicity of Pfs48/45 protein requires proper disulfide bond formation, consequently evaluation of the immunogenicity of recombinant full-length Pfs48/45 has been hampered by difficulties in expressing properly folded protein to date. Here we present a strategy involving harmonization of codons for successful recombinant expression of full length Pfs48/45 in Escherichia coli. The purified protein, designated CH-rPfs48/45, was recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed against reduction-sensitive conformational epitopes in the native protein. Immunogenicity evaluation in mice revealed potent transmission blocking activity in membrane feeding assays of antisera elicited by CH-rPfs48/45 formulated in three different adjuvants, i.e. Alum, Montanide ISA-51 and complete Freund's adjuvant. More importantly, CH-rPfs48/45 formulated with Montanide ISA-51 when administered to nonhuman primates (Olive baboons, Papio anubis) resulted in uniformly high antibody responses (ELISA titers &gt;2 million) in all five animals. Sera from these animals displayed greater than 93% blocking activity in membrane feeding assays after a single immunization, reaching nearly complete blocking after a booster dose of the vaccine. The relative ease of expression and induction of potent transmission blocking antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates provide a compelling rationale and basis for development of a CH-rPfs48/45 based malaria transmission blocking vaccine.",M1
19615093,"Epidemiology of <e>malaria</e> in an area prepared for clinical trials in Korogwe, north-eastern Tanzania.BACKGROUND: Site preparation is a pre-requesite in conducting malaria vaccines trials. This study was conducted in 12 villages to determine malariometric indices and associated risk factors, during long and short rainy seasons, in an area with varying malaria transmission intensities in Korogwe district, Tanzania. Four villages had passive case detection (PCD) of fever system using village health workers. METHODS: Four malariometric cross-sectional surveys were conducted between November 2005 and May 2007 among individuals aged 0-19 years, living in lowland urban, lowland rural and highland strata. A total of 10,766 blood samples were collected for malaria parasite diagnosis and anaemia estimation. Blood smears were stained with Giemsa while haemoglobin level was measured by HaemoCue. Socio-economic data were collected between Jan-Apr 2006. RESULTS: Adjusting for the effect of age, the risk of Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia was significantly lower in both lowland urban, (OR = 0.26; 95%CI: 0.23-0.29, p &lt; 0.001) and highlands, (OR = 0.21; 95%CI: 0.17-0.25, p &lt; 0.001) compared to lowland rural. Individuals aged 6-9 years in the lowland rural and 4-19 years in both lowland urban and highlands had the highest parasite prevalence, whilst children below five years in all strata had the highest parasite density. Prevalence of splenomegaly and gametocyte were also lower in both lowland urban and highlands than in lowland rural. Anaemia (Hb &lt;11 g/dl) prevalence was lowest in the lowland urban. Availability of PCD and higher socio-economic status (SES) were associated with reduced malaria and anaemia prevalence. CONCLUSION: Higher SES and use of bed nets in the lowland urban could be the important factors for low malaria infections in this stratum. Results obtained here were used together with those from PCD and DSS in selecting a village for Phase 1b MSP3 vaccine trial, which was conducted in the study area in year 2008.",M1
19607731,"Satisfactory safety and immunogenicity of MSP3 <e>malaria</e> vaccine candidate in Tanzanian children aged 12-24 months.BACKGROUND: Development and deployment of an effective malaria vaccine would complement existing malaria control measures. A blood stage malaria vaccine candidate, Merozoite Surface Protein-3 (MSP3), produced as a long synthetic peptide, has been shown to be safe in non-immune and semi-immune adults. A phase Ib dose-escalating study was conducted to assess the vaccine's safety and immunogenicity in children aged 12 to 24 months in Korogwe, Tanzania (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00469651). METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled, dose escalation phase Ib trial, in which children were given one of two different doses of the MSP3 antigen (15 microg or 30 microg) or a control vaccine (Engerix B). Children were randomly allocated either to the MSP3 candidate malaria vaccine or the control vaccine administered at a schedule of 0, 1, and 2 months. Immunization with lower and higher doses was staggered for safety reasons starting with the lower dose. The primary endpoint was safety and reactogenicity within 28 days post-vaccination. Blood samples were obtained at different time points to measure immunological responses. Results are presented up to 84 days post-vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 45 children were enrolled, 15 in each of the two MSP3 dose groups and 15 in the Engerix B group. There were no important differences in reactogenicity between the two MSP3 groups and Engerix B. Grade 3 adverse events were infrequent; only five were detected throughout the study, all of which were transient and resolved without sequelae. No serious adverse event reported was considered to be related to MSP3 vaccine. Both MSP3 dose regimens elicited strong cytophilic IgG responses (subclasses IgG1 and IgG3), the isotypes involved in the monocyte-dependant mechanism of Plasmodium falciparum parasite-killing. The titers reached are similar to those from African adults having reached a state of premunition. Furthermore, vaccination induced seroconversion in all vaccinees. CONCLUSION: The MSP3 malaria vaccine candidate was safe, well tolerated and immunogenic in children aged 12-24 months living in a malaria endemic community. Given the vaccine's safety and its induction of cytophilic IgG responses, its efficacy against P. falciparum infection and disease needs to be evaluated in Phase 2 studies.",M1
19581391,"Toward the rational design of a <e>malaria</e> vaccine construct using the MSP3 family as an example: contribution of immunogenicity studies in models.Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3), the target of antibodies that mediate parasite killing in cooperation with blood monocytes and are associated with protection in exposed populations, is a vaccine candidate under development. It belongs to a family of six structurally related genes. To optimize immunogenicity, we attempted to improve its design based on knowledge of antigenicity of various regions from the conserved C terminus of the six proteins and an analysis of the immunogenicity of  tailored  constructs. The immunogenicity studies were conducted in BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice, using MSP3 (referred to here as MSP3-1) as a model. Four constructs were designed in order to assess the effect of sequences flanking the 69-amino-acid region of MSP3-1 previously shown to be the target of biologically active antibodies. The results indicate major beneficial effects of removing (i) the subregion downstream from the 69-amino-acid sequence, since antibody titers increased by 2 orders of magnitude, and (ii) the upstream subregion which, although it defines a T-helper cell epitope, is not the target of antibodies. The construct, excluding both flanking sequences, was able to induce Th1-like responses, with a dominance of cytophilic antibodies. This led to design a multigenic construct based on these results, combining the six members of the MSP3 family. This new construction was immunogenic in mice, induced antibodies that recognized the parasite native proteins, and inhibited parasite growth in the functional antibody-dependent cellular inhibition assay, thus satisfying the preclinical criteria for a valuable vaccine candidate.",M1
19576940,"Molecular adjuvants for <e>malaria</e> DNA vaccines based on the modulation of host-cell apoptosis.Malaria represents a major global health problem but despite extensive efforts, no effective vaccine is available. Various vaccine candidates have been developed that provide protection in animal models, such as a gene gun-delivered DNA vaccine encoding the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium berghei. A common shortcoming of most malaria vaccines is the requirement for multiple immunizations leaving room for improvement even for established vaccine candidates such as the CSP-DNA vaccine. In this study, we explored whether regulating apoptosis in DNA vaccine transfected host cells could accelerate the onset of protective immunity and provide significant protection after a single immunization. A pro-apoptotic gene (Bax) was used as a molecular adjuvant in an attempt to mimic the immunostimulatory apoptosis triggered by viral or virus-derived vaccines, while anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-XL may increase the life span of transfected cells thus prolonging antigen production. Surprisingly, co-delivery of either Bax or Bcl-XL greatly reduced CSP-DNA vaccine efficacy after a single immunization. Co-delivery of Bax for three immunizations still had a detrimental effect on protective immunity, while repeated co-delivery of Bcl-XL had no negative impact. The fine characterization of humoral and cellular immune response modulated by these two molecular adjuvants revealed a previously unknown effect, i.e., a shift in the Th-profile. These results demonstrate that pro- or anti-apoptotic molecules should not be used as molecular adjuvants without careful evaluation of the resulting immune response. This finding represents yet another example that strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy developed for other model systems such as viral diseases cannot easily be applied to any vaccine.",M1

METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized trial, 102 healthy volunteers were evenly allocated to receive RTS,S/AS01B or RTS,S/AS02A vaccine at months 0, 1, and 2 of the study, followed by malaria challenge. Protected vaccine recipients were rechallenged 5 months later. RESULTS: RTS,S/AS01B and RTS,S/AS02A were well tolerated and were safe. The efficacy of RTS,S/AS01B and RTS,S/AS02A was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.9%-67.1%) and 32% (95% CI, 17.6%-47.6%), respectively. At the time of initial challenge, the RTS,S/AS01B group had greater circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific immune responses, including higher immunoglobulin (Ig) G titers, higher numbers of CSP-specific CD4(+) T cells expressing 2 activation markers (interleukin-2, interferon [IFN]-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or CD40L), and more ex vivo IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospots (ELISPOTs) than did the RTS,S/AS02A group. Protected vaccine recipients had a higher CSP-specific IgG titer (geometric mean titer, 188 vs 73 mug/mL; P &lt; .001), higher numbers of CSP-specific CD4(+) T cells per 10(6) CD4(+) T cells (median, 963 vs 308 CSP-specific CD4(+) T cells/10(6) CD4(+) T cells; P &lt; .001), and higher numbers of ex vivo IFN-gamma ELISPOTs (mean, 212 vs 96 spots/million cells; P &lt; .001).

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, phase 2b trial of RTS,S/AS02A in 2022 Mozambican children aged 1-4 years. We now report safety results for all randomized subjects and vaccine efficacy (VE) findings for children in the Manhiça area over the 45-month surveillance period. RESULTS: During the surveillance period, the VE((2.5-45)) (VE over months 2.5-45 of surveillance) against a first or only episode of clinical malaria disease was 30.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.9%-40.4%; P &lt; .001), and the VE((2.5-45)) against all episodes was 25.6% (95% CI, 11.9%-37.1%; P &lt; .001). When the same period was considered, the VE((2.5-45)) for subjects protected against severe malaria was 38.3% (95% CI, 3.4%-61.3%; P = .045).

Merozoite surface proteins involved in the invasion of host erythrocytes are likely targets of protective antibodies.

Ninety-four percent of the children were reinfected with P. vivax during biweekly follow-ups for 6 months. Since PvDBPII is polymorphic, we examined whether individuals acquired strain-specific immunity to PvDBPII. Children with high antibody levels to a prevalent PvDBPII allele (O) were associated with a delay in the time to reinfection with the same variant of P. vivax by 25% compared to parasites expressing other PvDBPII alleles (age-adjusted hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 1.00 by Cox regression]) and 39% lower incidence density parasitemia (P = 0.01). Two other prevalent alleles (AH and P) showed a similar trend of 16% and 18% protection, respectively, against parasites with the same PvDBPII allele and reduced incidence density parasitemia. Antibodies directed to PvDBPII PNG-P and -O were both associated with a 21 to 26% reduction in the risk of P. vivax infections with higher levels of parasitemia (&gt;150 parasites/mul), respectively. There was no association with high antibody levels to PvMSP1(19) and a delay in the time to P. vivax reinfection. Thus, anti-PvDBPII antibodies are associated with strain-specific immunity to P. vivax and support the use of PvDBPII for a vaccine against P. vivax.",M1
19563628,"Optimizing expression of the pregnancy <e>malaria</e> vaccine candidate, VAR2CSA in Pichia pastoris.BACKGROUND: VAR2CSA is the main candidate for a vaccine against pregnancy-associated malaria, but vaccine development is complicated by the large size and complex disulfide bonding pattern of the protein. Recent X-ray crystallographic information suggests that domain boundaries of VAR2CSA Duffy binding-like (DBL) domains may be larger than previously predicted and include two additional cysteine residues. This study investigated whether longer constructs would improve VAR2CSA recombinant protein secretion from Pichia pastoris and if domain boundaries were applicable across different VAR2CSA alleles. METHODS: VAR2CSA sequences were bioinformatically analysed to identify the predicted C11 and C12 cysteine residues at the C-termini of DBL domains and revised N- and C-termimal domain boundaries were predicted in VAR2CSA. Multiple construct boundaries were systematically evaluated for protein secretion in P. pastoris and secreted proteins were tested as immunogens. RESULTS: From a total of 42 different VAR2CSA constructs, 15 proteins (36%) were secreted. Longer construct boundaries, including the predicted C11 and C12 cysteine residues, generally improved expression of poorly or non-secreted domains and permitted expression of all six VAR2CSA DBL domains. However, protein secretion was still highly empiric and affected by subtle differences in domain boundaries and allelic variation between VAR2CSA sequences. Eleven of the secreted proteins were used to immunize rabbits. Antibodies reacted with CSA-binding infected erythrocytes, indicating that P. pastoris recombinant proteins possessed native protein epitopes. CONCLUSION: These findings strengthen emerging data for a revision of DBL domain boundaries in var-encoded proteins and may facilitate pregnancy malaria vaccine development.",M1
19562032,"Rapid assessment of <e>malaria</e> transmission using age-specific sero-conversion rates.BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission intensity is a crucial determinant of malarial disease burden and its measurement can help to define health priorities. Rapid, local estimates of transmission are required to focus resources better but current entomological and parasitological methods for estimating transmission intensity are limited in this respect. An alternative is determination of antimalarial antibody age-specific sero-prevalence to estimate sero-conversion rates (SCR), which have been shown to correlate with transmission intensity. This study evaluated SCR generated from samples collected from health facility attendees as a tool for a rapid assessment of malaria transmission intensity. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The study was conducted in north east Tanzania. Antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens MSP-1(19) and AMA-1 were measured by indirect ELISA. Age-specific antibody prevalence was analysed using a catalytic conversion model based on maximum likelihood to generate SCR. A pilot study, conducted near Moshi, found SCRs for AMA-1 were highly comparable between samples collected from individuals in a conventional cross-sectional survey and those collected from attendees at a local health facility. For the main study, 3885 individuals attending village health facilities in Korogwe and Same districts were recruited. Both malaria parasite prevalence and sero-positivity were higher in Korogwe than in Same. MSP-1(19) and AMA-1 SCR rates for Korogwe villages ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 and 0.07 to 0.21 respectively. In Same district there was evidence of a recent reduction in transmission, with SCR among those born since 1998 [MSP-1(19) 0.002 to 0.008 and AMA-1 0.005 to 0.014 ] being 5 to 10 fold lower than among individuals born prior to 1998 [MSP-1(19) 0.02 to 0.04 and AMA-1 0.04 to 0.13]. Current health facility specific estimates of SCR showed good correlations with malaria incidence rates in infants in a contemporaneous clinical trial (MSP-1(19) r(2) = 0.78, p&lt;0.01 &amp; AMA-1 r(2) = 0.91, p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SCRs generated from age-specific anti-malarial antibody prevalence data collected via health facility surveys were robust and credible. Analysis of SCR allowed detection of a recent drop in malaria transmission in line with recent data from other areas in the region. This health facility-based approach represents a potential tool for rapid assessment of recent trends in malaria transmission intensity, generating valuable data for local and national malaria control programs to target, monitor and evaluate their control strategies.",M1
19545652,"Age-dependent systemic antibody responses and immunisation-associated changes in mice orally and nasally immunised with Lactococcus lactis expressing a <e>malaria</e> parasite protein.Gram positive food-grade bacteria such as lactococci have significant advantages over attenuated pathogens as vaccine delivery vehicles because of their inherently greater safety. Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface antigen 2 (MSA2) was expressed in recombinant Lactococcus lactis both intracellularly and covalently anchored to the peptidoglycan of the cell wall (MSA2cP). Balb/c mice of different ages were immunised with the MSA2cP expressing L. lactis in a combined oral and nasal immunisation procedure. Serum IgG antibody responses to MSA2 were higher in young adult Balb/c mice compared to old mice and neonates. The elicited serum IgG antibodies reacted with native MSA2 on the surface of P. falciparum merozoites in an immunofluorescence assay. The serum IgG antibody isotypes in young adult mice were mainly IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b, while IgG3 tended to be higher in old mice. IgA antibodies to MSA2 were also produced in young mice. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, and more prominent lymphoid tissue in the lamina propria of the ileum and lymphoid follicles in the spleen, were observed in mice fed L. lactis. These findings are relevant for developing L. lactis as a vector to deliver vaccines in human populations.",M1

19505328,"Simulation of the cost-effectiveness of <e>malaria</e> vaccines.BACKGROUND: A wide range of possible malaria vaccines is being considered and there is a need to identify which vaccines should be prioritized for clinical development. An important element of the information needed for this prioritization is a prediction of the cost-effectiveness of potential vaccines in the transmission settings in which they are likely to be deployed. This analysis needs to consider a range of delivery modalities to ensure that clinical development plans can be aligned with the most appropriate deployment strategies. METHODS: The simulations are based on a previously published individual-based stochastic model for the natural history and epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Three different vaccine types: pre-erythrocytic vaccines (PEV), blood stage vaccines (BSV), mosquito-stage transmission-blocking vaccines (MSTBV), and combinations of these, are considered each delivered via a range of delivery modalities (Expanded Programme of Immunization - EPI-, EPI with booster, and mass vaccination combined with EPI). The cost-effectiveness ratios presented are calculated for four health outcomes, for assumed vaccine prices of US$ 2 or US$ 10 per dose, projected over a 10-year period. RESULTS: The simulations suggest that PEV will be more cost-effective in low transmission settings, while BSV at higher transmission settings. Combinations of BSV and PEV are more efficient than PEV, especially in moderate to high transmission settings, while compared to BSV they are more cost-effective in moderate to low transmission settings. Combinations of MSTBV and PEV or PEV and BSV improve the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness compared to PEV and BSV alone only when applied with EPI and mass vaccinations. Adding booster doses to the EPI is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to delivering vaccines via the EPI for any vaccine, while mass vaccination improves effectiveness, especially in low transmission settings, and is often a more efficient alternative to the EPI. However, the costs of increasing the coverage of mass vaccination over 50% often exceed the benefits. CONCLUSION: The simulations indicate malaria vaccines might be efficient malaria control interventions, and that both transmission setting and vaccine delivery modality are important to their cost-effectiveness. Alternative vaccine delivery modalities to the EPI may be more efficient than the EPI. Mass vaccination is predicted to provide substantial health benefits at low additional costs, although achieving high coverage rates can lead to substantial incremental costs.",M1
19502690,"Genetic polymorphism in msp-2, ama-1 and csp genes in Plasmodium falciparum field isolates from north and north-western India.BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVES: <e>Malaria</e> is a major public health problem in tropical and sub-tropical countries. Malaria vaccine is highly desirable as an adjunct to existing malaria control measures. The polymorphism in vaccine candidate antigens might be a hurdle in developing an effective vaccine. Merozoite surface protein-2, apical membrane antigen-1 and circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum are vaccine candidate antigens. The aim of this study was to detect extent of genetic polymorphism in potential vaccine candidate antigen genes, i.e. msp-2, ama-1 and csp of P. falciparum isolates prevalent in northern and north-western parts of India. METHODS: Overall 88 parasite isolates of P. falciparum were collected during July 1998-March 2002 from different parts of northern and north-western India. DNA was extracted and analyzed for genetic polymorphism by PCR-RFLP method. For msp-2 gene, family-specific (FC-27 and 3D7) nested PCR was also performed. RESULTS: PCR showed size polymorphism in all the target genes. Three alleles were observed in msp-2 and ama-1, while only two in csp. RFLP of ama-1 and csp with Dra-1 and Ssp-1 endonucleases respectively, failed to differentiate isolates in sub-allelic types, while Hinf-I digestion of msp-2 amplicons differentiated three alleles into two distinct allelic families, i.e. FC-27 and 3D7. The allelic family-specific PCR generally confirmed the results of PCR-RFLP except in a few isolates, which showed mixed (two) clones of msp-2 gene. INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: There was extensive polymorphism in msp-2 gene while ama-1 and csp genes showed low polymorphism which may be due to the functional constraints of these proteins. The low level transmission of malaria in the study area may also be a factor for low polymorphism.",M1
19464527,"Prevalence of serum neutralizing antibodies against chimpanzee adenovirus 63 and human adenovirus 5 in Kenyan children, in the context of vaccine vector efficacy.Vaccination against Plasmodium falciparum <e>malaria</e> could reduce the worldwide burden of this disease, and decrease its high mortality in children. Replication-defective recombinant adenovirus vectors carrying P. falciparum epitopes may be useful as part of a vaccine that raises cellular immunity to the pre-erythrocytic stage of malaria infection. However, existing immunity to the adenovirus vector results in antibody-mediated neutralization of the vaccine vector, and reduced vaccine immunogenicity. Our aim was to examine a population of children who are at risk from P. falciparum malaria for neutralizing immunity to replication-deficient recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus 63 vector (AdC63), compared to human adenovirus 5 vector (AdHu5). We measured 50% and 90% vector neutralization titers in 200 individual sera, taken from a cohort of children from Kenya, using a secreted alkaline phosphatase neutralization assay. We found that 23% of the children (aged 1-6 years) had high-titer neutralizing antibodies to AdHu5, and 4% had high-titer neutralizing antibodies to AdC63. Immunity to both vectors was age-dependent. Low-level neutralization of AdC63 was significantly less frequent than AdHu5 neutralization at the 90% neutralization level. We conclude that AdC63 may be a useful vector as part of a prime-boost malaria vaccine in children.",M1

The mosquitoes were collected monthly from May 2007 to April 2008 by human landing catch technique from 6:00-12:00 PM for 2 consecutive nights, at 3 collection sites. A total of 3,048 mosquitoes within 5 species were captured: An. epiroticus, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, Cx. sitiens Wiedemann, Aedes aegypti (L.) and Ae. albopictus Skuse. PCR was used for molecular identification of An. sundaicus complex, by determination of COI, ITS2, and D3 genes. The target mosquitoes were An. epiroticus, which was the predominant species, accounting for 43.8% of specimens collected. The biting cycle pattern increased during 6:00-8:00 PM and reached a maximum of 6.6 bites/person/hour by 12:00 PM. The mosquitoes varied in population density throughout the year. The highest biting rate was 37.6 bites/person/ half night in September and the lowest (10.2 bites/person/half night) in January. Nested PCR and real-time PCR techniques were used to detect the malaria parasite in An. epiroticus adult females. Nine of 926 (0.97%) mosquitoes tested were malaria parasite positive: 6 P. falciparum and 3 P. vivax. The infective mosquitoes were found in the dry and early rainy seasons. The overall annual entomological inoculation rate (EIR) in the village was 76.6. The overall parity rate was 74%. A total of 38 cement tanks were used to characterize the nature of the breeding places of An. epiroticus. An. epiroticus larvae coexisted with Aedes and Culex larvae; the maximum larval density was more than 140 larvae per dip in May. Breeding places included fresh, brackish and salt water, typically with full sunlight and mats of green algae on the water surface. The salinity of the water ranged from 0.5 to 119.4 g/l, with a narrow pH range of 8.2-8.7. Dissolved oxygen was highest in November (6.27 mg/l) and lowest in March (3.46 mg/l).

20577158,"<e>Malaria</e> surveillance - United States, 2008.PROBLEM/CONDITION: Malaria in humans is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of the genus Plasmodium. These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective female Anopheles species mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United States occur among persons who have traveled to areas with ongoing malaria transmission. In the United States, cases can occur through exposure to infected blood products, congenital transmission, or local mosquitoborne transmission. Malaria surveillance is conducted to identify episodes of local transmission and to guide prevention recommendations for travelers. PERIOD COVERED: This report summarizes cases in patients with onset of illness in 2008 and summarizes trends during previous years. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood film, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic tests are mandated to be reported to local and state health departments by health-care providers or laboratory staff members. Case investigations are conducted by local and state health departments, and reports are transmitted to CDC through the National Malaria Surveillance System (NMSS), National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), and direct CDC consultations. Data from these reporting systems are the basis for this report. RESULTS: CDC received reports of 1,298 cases of malaria with an onset of symptoms in 2008 among patients in the United States, a decrease of 13.8% from the 1,505 cases reported for 2007 (p&lt;0.001). These cases included one transfusion-related case, one congenital case, and two fatal cases. Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale were identified in 40.6%, 14.6%, 1.5%, and 1.4% of cases, respectively. The first documented case of simian malaria, P. knowlesi, was reported in a U.S. traveler. Eight (0.6%) of the 1,298 patients were infected by two or more species. The infecting species was unreported or undetermined in 41.2% of cases. Based on estimated volume of travel from the World Tourism Organization, the highest estimated relative case rates of malaria among travelers occurred among those returning from countries in West Africa. A total of 508 U.S. civilians acquired malaria abroad; among the 480 civilians for whom chemoprophylaxis information was known, 344 (71.7%) reported that they had not followed a chemoprophylactic drug regimen recommended by CDC for the area to which they had traveled. Fourteen cases were reported in pregnant women, among whom none adhered to a complete prevention drug regimen. INTERPRETATION: A significant decrease in the number of malaria cases occurred from 2007 to 2008. No change occurred in the proportions of cases caused by the various Plasmodium species. U.S. civilians traveling to countries in West Africa had the highest estimated relative case rates. In the majority of reported cases, U.S. civilians who acquired malaria abroad had not adhered to a chemoprophylaxis regimen that was appropriate for the country in which they acquired the infection. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Persons traveling to an area in which malaria is endemic should take steps to prevent malaria, which might include taking one of the recommended chemoprophylaxis regimens appropriate for the region of travel and using personal protection measures to prevent mosquito bites. Any person who has been to a malarious area and who subsequently develops a fever or influenza-like symptoms should seek medical care immediately and report their travel history to the clinician; investigation should always include blood-film tests for malaria with results available immediately. Malaria infections can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Malaria prevention recommendations are available from CDC online (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/contentDiseases.aspx#malaria) or by calling the Malaria Hotline (telephone 770-488-7788). Malaria treatment recommendations can be obtained from CDC online (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment/treatment.htm) or by calling the Malaria Hotline.",M2

Methods: In the present study, data from 50 US states and the District of Columbia on malaria outbreaks in 1994, compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was analyzed in relation to state by state all cancer mortality data, 1950-94, from the National Cancer Institute. RESULTS: There was a significant association of malaria incidence with all cancer mortality in 50 US states and the District of Columbia. The association was independent of state population size, percentage black population by state, and median population age. CONCLUSION: The association between malaria and cancer mortality can be possibly explained by the well established ability of Plasmodium to induce suppression of the immune system. A second explanation may be that the anopheles mosquito, the vector of malaria, transmits an obscure virus that initially causes only a mild transitory illness but much later predisposes to cancer.",M2

This is the first crystal structure of a parasitic arginase. Various protein constructs were explored to identify an optimally active enzyme form for inhibition and structural studies and to probe the structure and function of two polypeptide insertions unique to malarial arginase: a 74-residue low-complexity region contained in loop L2 and an 11-residue segment contained in loop L8. Structural studies indicate that the low-complexity region is largely disordered and is oriented away from the trimer interface; its deletion does not significantly compromise enzyme activity. The loop L8 insertion is located at the trimer interface and makes several intra- and intermolecular interactions important for enzyme function. In addition, we also demonstrate that arg- Plasmodium berghei sporozoites show significantly decreased liver infectivity in vivo. Therefore, inhibition of malarial arginase may serve as a possible candidate for antimalarial therapy against liver-stage infection, and ABH may serve as a lead for the development of inhibitors.",M2

Other studies from malaria-endemic areas have reported an adverse effect of iron supplements on malaria prevalence in pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between iron/folic acid supplements and prenatal antimalaria prophylaxis on neonatal mortality in malaria-endemic countries of sub-Saharan Africa. DESIGN: This analysis used the most recent data from Demographic and Health Surveys of 19 malaria-endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Survival information of 101,636 singleton live-born infants from the most recent delivery of ever-married women &lt; or =5 y before each survey was examined. The effect of each potential predictor on neonatal deaths was analyzed by using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Infants whose mothers received any iron/folic acid supplements and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine intermittent preventive treatment (SP-IPT(p)) for malaria during pregnancy were significantly protected from neonatal death [hazard ratio (HR): 0.76; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.99]. The protective effect was not significant in mothers who received only iron/folic acid supplements (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.12) or only SP-IPT(p) (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.57). Among the sociodemographic and birth characteristics, factors that significantly increased the risk of neonatal death included first-born infants, a birth interval of &lt;2 y, maternal age at delivery of &gt; or =30 y, smaller than average-sized infants, and male infants.

Pregnant women are among the groups with the highest risk of malaria. Use of insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) is a cost-effective method of controlling malaria. Despite this, there is low utilisation of ITNs among pregnant women in Kilifi district which is an endemic malaria zone. OBJECTIVE: To determine knowledge, attitude and practice on the use of ITNs in the prevention of malaria among pregnant women in Kilifi district. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study. SETTING: The district hospital and the five health centres in Kilifi district SUBJECTS: Two hundred and twenty pregnant women attending antenatal clinics (ANC) between October and December 2007. RESULTS: Knowledge on malaria illness and ITNs was high with majority of pregnant women having adequate level of knowledge (86.9%). There was significant association between level of education and adequate knowledge (P-value = 0.010). Good attitude on ITNs use was low. There was no association between good attitude and any of the socio-demographic variables. The majority of pregnant women attending ANC owned ITNs (75.4%). ITNs usage was high (70.5%). There was significant association between religion and good practice (p-value = 0.050). Although adequate level of knowledge on malaria and protective role of ITNs was high, there was no association between knowledge with practice and attitude.

OBJECTIVE: To identify factors affecting net utilisation (sleeping under insecticide treated net) among caregivers of under fives in Makueni District in Kenya. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, descriptive study. SETTING: Eight sub-locations in Wote division Makueni district. SUBJECTS: Four hundred caregivers of children aged five years and below. RESULTS: The results indicated that 88.5% of caregivers were aware of ITNs. The proportion of households with children below five years that owned mosquito net were found to be 46.2%, and only 32.0% had at least a treated net. Slightly more than half of treated nets were used by under fives (52.2%) compared to 47.8% used by children over five years including adults. The main reason cited by majority of caregivers as a hindrance to net utilisation was lack of treated nets in households (72.3%). Utilisation of ITNs by under five children was found to be positively associated with knowledge of ITNs (p = 0.024), marital status (p = 0.018) and occupation (p = 0.043). CONCLUSION: Utilisation of ITNs by under fives was low despite high level of awareness among caregivers. Factors such as awareness of ITNs, marital status and occupation significantly affected ITNs utilisation. Although the government with support from other stakeholders has recently embarked on large scale distribution of nets in high risky districts, more interventions from various stakeholders are needed to increase availability and accessibility of subsidised permanently treated nets, including interventions to address non-compliance to proper utilisation of nets. There is also need for intensive education emphasising on their proper and consistent use. Scaling up proper use of ITNs along with other initiatives can contribute significantly in reducing malaria.",M2

20499745,"ITN utilization among pregnant women attending ANC in Etsako West Lga, Edo State, Nigeria.OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors affecting utilization of ITN by pregnant women in Etsako West LGA, Edo State. METHODOLOGY: A descriptive cross-sectional study design was employed. Using a systematic sampling method, a total of 385 respondents were selected from all ANC facilities in the LGA following a verbally obtained consent. Tool for data collection was a semi-structured, researcher administered questionnaire. RESULT: The respondents' knowledge of cause of <e>malaria</e> was good, as 269 (69%) had good knowledge but only 9 (2.3%) knew its effects on the foetus. Meanwhile, ownership of ITN and its use were very low, 36 (9.3%) and 31 (8.0) respectively. The main factor affecting the use of the commodity in the LGA was unavailability of ITNs. Other factors included belief of the women on the effectiveness of the commodity, level of education, marital status and family sizes ofrespondents. CONCLUSION: Use of Insecticide treated bed net has been hampered by unavailability of the commodity. It is therefore recommended that efforts should be made to make the commodity available to reduce morbidity and mortality among this vulnerable group.",M2
20496588,"Botanical repellents and pesticides traditionally used against hematophagous invertebrates in Lao People's Democratic Republic: a comparative study of plants used in 66 villages.Hematophagous parasites such as leeches, ticks, mites, lice, bedbugs, mosquitoes, and myiasis-producing fly larvae are common health problems in Lao People's Democratic Republic. Several arthropod-borne infections, e.g., <e>malaria</e>, dengue fever, and Japanese encephalitis, are endemic there. Effective vector control methods including the use of pesticides, insecticide-treated bed nets, and synthetic and plant-based repellents are important means of control against such invertebrates and the pathogens they may transmit or directly cause. In this study, we documented traditional knowledge on plants that are used to repel or kill hematophagous arthropods, including mosquitoes, bedbugs, human lice, mites and ticks, fly larvae, and blood-sucking leeches. Structured interviews were carried out in 66 villages comprising 17 ethnic groups, covering a range of cultures, throughout Lao People's Democratic Republic. A total of 92 plant species was recorded as traditional repellents (including plants for pesticidal usages) in 123 different plant-ectoparasite combinations. The number and species of plants, and animal taxa repelled (or killed) per plant species differed per region, village, and ethnic group. Traditional use was confirmed in the scientific literature for 74 of these plant species, and for an additional 13 species using literature on closely related species. The use of botanical repellents and pesticides from many plant species is common and widespread in the Lao countryside. In the future, the identification of the active components in certain plants to develop more optimal, inexpensive repellents, insecticides, acaricides, or antileech compounds as alternatives to synthetic repellents/pesticides against blood-feeding insects, ticks, mites, and leeches is warranted.",M2

Monitoring studies should be planned during any wide-scale malaria control program integrating insecticide-treated materials, to evaluate their effects and effectiveness on epidemiologically relevant parameters. Such operational control interventions may be challenged by insecticide resistance spread within vector populations, as a result of wide insecticide pressure. A nationwide distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets was implemented throughout Niger in 2005. We studied the population genetic structure of major malaria vectors across Nigerien Sahel, and investigated potential effects of this large malaria control intervention. Wild-caught Anopheles gambiae sensu lato females from seven villages and two wet seasons were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci. The genetic diversity within both species appeared homogenous between villages and years. The estimated genetic differentiation among samples was very low within both species, indicating high gene flow across the area. An absence of differentiation was also found between 2005 and 2006 wet seasons, for all samples but one, showing that the net distribution did not impact significantly the genetic diversity and structure of vector populations in a single year. We provide valuable results participating to document effects of large malaria control programs, to maximize the efficiency of available tools in future interventions.",M2

In Mali, meeting this prerequisite is impeded by underuse of laboratory diagnosis by clinicians, absence of qualified laboratory facilities in some locations, and poor continuous professional education of laboratory technicians. The twofold aim of this investigation was to perform quality control of thick smear readings made by laboratory technicians in 1998 and 1999 and to study the feasibility and diagnostic value of two rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), i.e., ParaSight and OptiMAL, in comparison with the thick smear technique in the period from 1998 to 2003. Quality control of thick smear readings indicated a 56% false positive rate with 49.3% concordance between laboratory technician readings and the reference centre. Trials using RDT showed that the OptiMAL test was more efficient with 97.2% sensibility, 95.4% specificity and 93% concordance in comparison with thick smear. A program of training, refresher courses, and regular didactic supervision (quality control) for laboratory technicians has been set up in Mali under the sponsorship of the  Fondation Mérieux  (ACTION BIOMALI) and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI).

20484391,"CISH and susceptibility to infectious diseases.BACKGROUND: The interleukin-2-mediated immune response is critical for host defense against infectious pathogens. Cytokine-inducible SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain protein (CISH), a suppressor of cytokine signaling, controls interleukin-2 signaling. METHODS: Using a case-control design, we tested for an association between CISH polymorphisms and susceptibility to major infectious diseases (bacteremia, tuberculosis, and severe <e>malaria</e>) in blood samples from 8402 persons in Gambia, Hong Kong, Kenya, Malawi, and Vietnam. We had previously tested 20 other immune-related genes in one or more of these sample collections. RESULTS: We observed associations between variant alleles of multiple CISH polymorphisms and increased susceptibility to each infectious disease in each of the study populations. When all five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (at positions -639, -292, -163, +1320, and +3415 [all relative to CISH]) within the CISH-associated locus were considered together in a multiple-SNP score, we found an association between CISH genetic variants and susceptibility to bacteremia, malaria, and tuberculosis (P=3.8x10(-11) for all comparisons), with -292 accounting for most of the association signal (P=4.58x10(-7)). Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells obtained from adult subjects carrying the -292 variant, as compared with wild-type cells, showed a muted response to the stimulation of interleukin-2 production--that is, 25 to 40% less CISH expression. CONCLUSIONS: Variants of CISH are associated with susceptibility to diseases caused by diverse infectious pathogens, suggesting that negative regulators of cytokine signaling have a role in immunity against various infectious diseases. The overall risk of one of these infectious diseases was increased by at least 18% among persons carrying the variant CISH alleles.",M2
20482824,"Bionomics of Anopheline species and <e>malaria</e> transmission dynamics along an altitudinal transect in Western Cameroon.BACKGROUND: Highland areas of Africa are mostly malaria hypoendemic, due to climate which is not appropriate for anophelines development and their reproductive fitness. In view of designing a malaria control strategy in Western Cameroon highlands, baseline data on anopheline species bionomics were collected. METHODS: Longitudinal entomological surveys were conducted in three localities at different altitudinal levels. Mosquitoes were captured when landing on human volunteers and by pyrethrum spray catches. Sampled Anopheles were tested for the presence of Plasmodium circumsporozoite proteins and their blood meal origin with ELISA. Entomological parameters of malaria epidemiology were assessed using Mac Donald's formula. RESULTS: Anopheline species diversity and density decreased globally from lowland to highland. The most aggressive species along the altitudinal transect was Anopheles gambiae s.s. of S molecular form, followed in the lowland and on the plateau by An. funestus, but uphill by An. hancocki. An. gambiae and An. ziemanni exhibited similar seasonal biting patterns at the different levels, whereas different features were observed for An. funestus. Only indoor resting species could be captured uphill; it is therefore likely that endophilic behaviour is necessary for anophelines to climb above a certain threshold. Of the ten species collected along the transect, only An. gambiae and An. funestus were responsible for malaria transmission, with entomological inoculation rates (EIR) of 90.5, 62.8 and zero infective bites/human/year in the lowland, on the plateau and uphill respectively. The duration of gonotrophic cycle was consistently one day shorter for An. gambiae as compared to An. funestus at equal altitude. Altitudinal climate variations had no effect on the survivorship and the subsequent life expectancy of the adult stage of these malaria vectors, but most probably on aquatic stages. On the contrary increasing altitude significantly extended the duration of gonotrophic cycle and reduced: the EIR, their preference to human blood and consequently the malaria stability index. CONCLUSION: Malaria epidemiological rooting in the outskirts of Western Cameroon highlands evolves with increasing altitude, gradually from stable to unstable settings. This suggests a potential risk of malaria epidemic in highlands, and the need for a continuous epidemiological surveillance.",M2

METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study in the districts of Apac and Oyam of Lango, northern Uganda. Volunteers were clinically examined, and 5 ml samples of venous blood were taken in heparinised tubes for a 6-month post-spray screening for DDT and plasma markers of liver function and internal organ disease. DDE/DDT was assayed using ELISA kits (Abraxis, USA); plasma enzyme activity concentrations of amylase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) were analysed using routine clinical chemistry-automated methods (Konelab, Vantaa, Finland). RESULTS: All 96 plasma samples analysed for xenobiotics contained DDE/DDT in the empirical range of 24.00 - 128.00 parts per billion (ppb) with a mean (SD) of 77.00 (+/-26.00) ppb. All 119 plasma samples studied for the markers exhibited enzyme activity concentration values within the population reference ranges, with empirical means (SD) of amylase 71.86 (34.07), AST 23.83 (12.71), ALT 7.84 (10.01) and GGT 58.37 (62.68) microg/l. CONCLUSION: Six months after IRS with DDT, the spray team had an average concentration of plasma DDE/DDT of 77 ppb. This had no deleterious effect on liver function. We recommend continued use of DDT for IRS disease control in Uganda until better practical alternatives are available.",M2
20459650,"Beneficial effect of aurothiomalate on murine <e>malaria</e>.BACKGROUND: Premature death of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes is considered to favourably influence the clinical course of malaria. Aurothiomalate has previously been shown to trigger erythrocyte death or eryptosis, which is characterized by cell membrane scrambling leading to phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface. Phosphatidylserine-exposing cells are rapidly cleared from circulating blood. The present study thus tested whether sodium aurothiomalate influences the intraerythrocytic parasite development in vitro and the clinical course of murine malaria in vivo. METHODS: Human erythrocytes were infected with Plasmodium falciparum BinH in vitro and mice were infected (intraperitoneal injection of 1 x 106 parasitized murine erythrocytes) with Plasmodium berghei ANKA in vivo. RESULTS: Exposure to aurothiomalate significantly decreased the in vitro parasitemia of P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes without influencing the intraerythrocytic DNA/RNA content. Administration of sodium aurothiomalate in vivo (daily 10 mg/kg b.w. s.c. from the 8th day of infection) enhanced the percentage of phosphatidylserine-exposing infected and noninfected erythrocytes in blood. All nontreated mice died within 30 days of infection. Aurothiomalate-treatment delayed the lethal course of malaria leading to survival of more than 50% of the mice 30 days after infection. CONCLUSIONS: Sodium aurothiomalate influences the survival of Plasmodium berghei-infected mice, an effect only partially explained by stimulation of eryptosis.",M2
20459613,"Towards a precise test for <e>malaria</e> diagnosis in the Brazilian Amazon: comparison among field microscopy, a rapid diagnostic test, nested PCR, and a computational expert system based on artificial neural networks.BACKGROUND: Accurate malaria diagnosis is mandatory for the treatment and management of severe cases. Moreover, individuals with asymptomatic malaria are not usually screened by health care facilities, which further complicates disease control efforts. The present study compared the performances of a malaria rapid diagnosis test (RDT), the thick blood smear method and nested PCR for the diagnosis of symptomatic malaria in the Brazilian Amazon. In addition, an innovative computational approach was tested for the diagnosis of asymptomatic malaria. METHODS: The study was divided in two parts. For the first part, passive case detection was performed in 311 individuals with malaria-related symptoms from a recently urbanized community in the Brazilian Amazon. A cross-sectional investigation compared the diagnostic performance of the RDT Optimal-IT, nested PCR and light microscopy. The second part of the study involved active case detection of asymptomatic malaria in 380 individuals from riverine communities in Rondônia, Brazil. The performances of microscopy, nested PCR and an expert computational system based on artificial neural networks (MalDANN) using epidemiological data were compared. RESULTS: Nested PCR was shown to be the gold standard for diagnosis of both symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria because it detected the major number of cases and presented the maximum specificity. Surprisingly, the RDT was superior to microscopy in the diagnosis of cases with low parasitaemia. Nevertheless, RDT could not discriminate the Plasmodium species in 12 cases of mixed infections (Plasmodium vivax + Plasmodium falciparum). Moreover, the microscopy presented low performance in the detection of asymptomatic cases (61.25% of correct diagnoses). The MalDANN system using epidemiological data was worse that the light microscopy (56% of correct diagnoses). However, when information regarding plasma levels of interleukin-10 and interferon-gamma were inputted, the MalDANN performance sensibly increased (80% correct diagnoses). CONCLUSIONS: An RDT for malaria diagnosis may find a promising use in the Brazilian Amazon integrating a rational diagnostic approach. Despite the low performance of the MalDANN test using solely epidemiological data, an approach based on neural networks may be feasible in cases where simpler methods for discriminating individuals below and above threshold cytokine levels are available.",M2

The surveys, the conduct of which directly involved the national <e>malaria</e> control programme managers of the two countries, provides the groundwork for evidence-based policy implementation. The results of the surveys could be extrapolated to other countries with similar socio-demographic and malaria profiles. The meeting resulted in recommendations on key actions to be taken at the global, national, and community level for better ACT accessibility. At the global level, both public and private sectors have actions to take to strengthen policies that lead to the replacement of loose blister packs with fixed-dose ACT products, develop strategies to ban inappropriate anti-malarials and regulate those bans, and facilitate technology and knowledge transfer to scale up production of fixed-dose ACT products, which should be readily available and affordable to those patients who are in the greatest need of these medicines. At the national level, policies that regulate the anti-malarial medicines market should be enacted and enforced. The public sector, including funding donors, should participate in ensuring that the private sector is engaged in the ACT implementation process. Research similar to the surveys discussed is important for other countries to develop and evaluate the right incentives at a local level. At the community level, community outreach and education about appropriate preventive and treatment measures must continue and be strengthened, with service delivery systems developed within both public and private sectors, among other measures, to decrease access to ineffective and inappropriate anti-malarial medicines. What was clear during the meeting is that continuing commitment, strengthened interaction and transparency among various stakeholders, with focus on communities, national governments, and evidence-based policy and action are the only way to sustainably address the control of malaria, a disease which continues to have a significant health and socio-economic impact worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

This paper presents and discusses a methodology for estimating the lives saved through selected service deliveries reported to the Global Fund. METHODS: Global Fund-supported programs reported, by end-2007, 1.4 million HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral treatment (ARV), 3.3 million new smear-positive tuberculosis cases detected in DOTS (directly observed TB treatment, short course) programs, and 46 million insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) delivered. We estimated the corresponding lives saved using adaptations of existing epidemiological estimation models. RESULTS: By end-2007, an estimated 681,000 lives (95% uncertainty range 619,000-774,000) were saved and 1,097,000 (993,000-1,249,000) life-years gained by ARV. DOTS treatment would have saved 1.63 million lives (1.09-2.17 million) when compared against no treatment, or 408,000 lives (265,000-551,000) when compared against non-DOTS treatment. ITN distributions in countries with stable endemic falciparum malaria were estimated to have achieved protection from malaria for 26 million of child-years at risk cumulatively, resulting in 130,000 (27,000-232,000) under-5 deaths prevented. CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate the scale of mortality effects that supported programs may have achieved in recent years, despite margins of uncertainty and covering only selected intervention components. Evidence-based evaluation of disease impact of the programs supported by the Global Fund with international and in-country partners must be strengthened using population-level data on intervention coverage and demographic outcomes, information on quality of services, and trends in disease burdens recorded in national health information systems.",M2

Here we show that after infection of mice with Plasmodium chabaudi, a c-Kit(hi) progenitor subset positive for interleukin 7 receptor-alpha (IL-7Ralpha) emerged that had both lymphoid and myeloid potential in vitro. After being transferred into uninfected alymphoid or malaria-infected hosts, IL-7Ralpha(+)c-Kit(hi) progenitors generated mainly myeloid cells that contributed to the clearance of infected erythrocytes in infected hosts. The generation of these infection-induced progenitors was critically dependent on interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling in hematopoietic progenitors.

20424529,"<e>Malaria</e> infection and human evolution.During the evolution of the genus Homo, with regard to the species habilis, erectus and sapiens, malaria has played a key biological role in influencing human development. The plasmodia causing malaria have evolved in two ways, in biological and phylogenetic terms: Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale appear to have either coevolved with human mankind, or encountered human species during the most ancient phases of Homo evolution; on the other hand, Plasmodium falciparum has been transmitted to humans by monkeys in a more recent period, probably between the end of the Mesolithic and the beginning of the Neolithic age. The authors show both direct and indirect biomolecular evidence of malarial infection, detected in buried subjects, dating to ancient times and brought to light in the course of archaeological excavations in major Mediterranean sites. In this review of the literature the authors present scientific evidence confirming the role of malaria in affecting the evolution of populations in Mediterranean countries. The people living in several different Mediterranean regions, the cradle of western civilization, have been progressively influenced by malaria in the course of the spread of this endemic disease in recent millennia. In addition, populations affected by endemic malaria progressively developed cultural, dietary and behavioural adaptation mechanisms, which contributed to diminish the risk of disease. These habits were probably not fully conscious. Nevertheless it may be thought that both these customs and biological modifications, caused by malarial plasmodia, favoured the emergence of groups of people with greater resistance to malaria. All these factors have diminished the unfavourable demographic impact of the disease, also positively influencing the general development and growth of civilization.",M2

20416059,"Predicting and mapping <e>malaria</e> under climate change scenarios: the potential redistribution of malaria vectors in Africa.BACKGROUND: Malaria is rampant in Africa and causes untold mortality and morbidity. Vector-borne diseases are climate sensitive and this has raised considerable concern over the implications of climate change on future disease risk. The problem of malaria vectors (Anopheles mosquitoes) shifting from their traditional locations to invade new zones is an important concern. The vision of this study was to exploit the sets of information previously generated by entomologists, e.g. on geographical range of vectors and malaria distribution, to build models that will enable prediction and mapping the potential redistribution of Anopheles mosquitoes in Africa. METHODS: The development of the modelling tool was carried out through calibration of CLIMEX parameters. The model helped estimate the potential geographical distribution and seasonal abundance of the species in relation to climatic factors. These included temperature, rainfall and relative humidity, which characterized the living environment for Anopheles mosquitoes. The same parameters were used in determining the ecoclimatic index (EI). The EI values were exported to a GIS package for special analysis and proper mapping of the potential future distribution of Anopheles gambiae and Anophles arabiensis within the African continent under three climate change scenarios. RESULTS: These results have shown that shifts in these species boundaries southward and eastward of Africa may occur rather than jumps into quite different climatic environments. In the absence of adequate control, these predictions are crucial in understanding the possible future geographical range of the vectors and the disease, which could facilitate planning for various adaptation options. CONCLUSION: Thus, the outputs from this study will be helpful at various levels of decision making, for example, in setting up of an early warning and sustainable strategies for climate change and climate change adaptation for malaria vectors control programmes in Africa.",M2

Alterations in metabolism of male and female mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA are reported here. METHODS: 1H NMR spectra of urine, sera and brain extracts of these mice were analysed over disease progression using Principle Component Analysis and Orthogonal Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis. RESULTS: Analyses of overall changes in urinary profiles during disease progression demonstrate that females show a significant early post-infection shift in metabolism as compared to males. In contrast, serum profiles of female mice remain unaltered in the early infection stages; whereas that of the male mice changed. Brain metabolite profiles do not show global changes in the early stages of infection in either sex. By the late stages urine, serum and brain profiles of both sexes are severely affected. Analyses of individual metabolites show significant increase in lactate, alanine and lysine, kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid in sera of both males and females at this stage. Early changes in female urine are marked by an increase of ureidopropionate, lowering of carnitine and transient enhancement of asparagine and dimethylglycine. Several metabolites when analysed individually in sera and brain reveal significant changes in their levels in the early phase of infection mainly in female mice. Asparagine and dimethylglycine levels decrease and quinolinic acid increases early in sera of infected females. In brain extracts of females, an early rise in levels is also observed for lactate, alanine and glycerol, kynurenic acid, ureidopropionate and 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that P. berghei infection leads to impairment of glycolysis, lipid metabolism, metabolism of tryptophan and degradation of uracil. Characterization of early changes along these pathways may be crucial for prognosis and better disease management. Additionally, the distinct sexual dimorphism exhibited in these responses has a bearing on the understanding of the pathophysiology of malaria.",M2
20412600,"Assessing the quality of service of village <e>malaria</e> workers to strengthen community-based malaria control in Cambodia.BACKGROUND: Malaria continues to be a major public health problem in remote forested areas in Cambodia. As a national strategy to strengthen community-based malaria control, the Cambodian government has been running the Village Malaria Worker (VMW) project since 2001. This study sought to examine the nature and quality of the VMWs' services. METHODS: Data collection was carried out in February and March 2008 through interviews with one of the two VMWs who takes the lead in malaria control activities in each of the 315 VMW villages (n = 251). The questionnaire addressed 1) the sociodemographic characteristics of VMWs, 2) service quality, 3) actions for malaria prevention and vector control, and 4) knowledge of malaria epidemiology and vector ecology. RESULTS: VMWs were effective in conducting diagnosis with Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) and prescribing anti-malarials to those who had positive RDT results, skills that they had acquired through their training programmes. However, most other services, such as active detection, explanations about compliance, and follow-up of patients, were carried out by only a small proportion of VMWs. The variety of actions that VMWs took for malaria prevention and vector control was small (average action index score 12.8/23), and their knowledge was very limited with less than 20% of the VMWs giving correct answers to six out of seven questions on malaria epidemiology and vector ecology. Knowledge of vector breeding places and malaria transmission were significant determinants of both the quality of VMWs' services and the variety of their actions for malaria prevention and vector control. CONCLUSIONS: VMWs' services focused primarily on diagnosis and treatment. Their focus needs to be broadened to cover other aspects of malaria control in order to further strengthen community-based malaria control. VMWs' actions and knowledge also need substantial improvement. Strengthening training programmes can help achieve better performance by VMWs.",M2
20409349,"Sub-microscopic <e>malaria</e> cases and mixed malaria infection in a remote area of high malaria endemicity in Rattanakiri province, Cambodia: implication for malaria elimination.BACKGROUND: Malaria microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests are insensitive for very low-density parasitaemia. This insensitivity may lead to missed asymptomatic sub-microscopic parasitaemia, a potential reservoir for infection. Similarly, mixed infections and interactions between Plasmodium species may be missed. The objectives were first to develop a rapid and sensitive PCR-based diagnostic method to detect low parasitaemia and mixed infections, and then to investigate the epidemiological importance of sub-microscopic and mixed infections in Rattanakiri Province, Cambodia. METHODS: A new malaria diagnostic method, using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the cytochrome b genes of the four human Plasmodium species and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, has been developed. The results of this RFLP-dHPLC method have been compared to 1) traditional nested PCR amplification of the 18S rRNA gene, 2) sequencing of the amplified fragments of the cytochrome b gene and 3) microscopy. Blood spots on filter paper and Giemsa-stained blood thick smears collected in 2001 from 1,356 inhabitants of eight villages of Rattanakiri Province have been analysed by the RFLP-dHPLC method and microscopy to assess the prevalence of sub-microscopic and mixed infections. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the new RFLP-dHPLC was similar to that of the other molecular methods. The RFLP-dHPLC method was more sensitive and specific than microscopy, particularly for detecting low-level parasitaemia and mixed infections. In Rattanakiri Province, the prevalences of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax were approximately two-fold and three-fold higher, respectively, by RFLP-dHPLC (59% and 15%, respectively) than by microscopy (28% and 5%, respectively). In addition, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae were never detected by microscopy, while they were detected by RFLP-dHPLC, in 11.2% and 1.3% of the blood samples, respectively. Moreover, the proportion of mixed infections detected by RFLP-dHPLC was higher (23%) than with microscopy (8%). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid and sensitive molecular diagnosis method developed here could be considered for mass screening and ACT treatment of inhabitants of low-endemicity areas of Southeast Asia.",M2
20409342,"Comparison of anaemia and parasitaemia as indicators of <e>malaria</e> control in household and EPI-health facility surveys in Malawi.BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has recommended that anaemia be used as an additional indicator to monitor malaria burden at the community level as malaria interventions are nationally scaled up. To date, there are no published evaluations of this recommendation. METHODS: To evaluate this recommendation, a comparison of anaemia and parasitaemia among 6-30 month old children was made during two repeated cross-sectional household (HH) and health facility (HF) surveys in six districts across Malawi at baseline (2005) and in a follow-up survey (2008) after a scale up of malaria control interventions. RESULTS: HH net ownership did not increase between the years (50.5% vs. 49.8%), but insecticide treated net (ITN) ownership increased modestly from 41.5% (95% CI: 37.2%-45.8%) in 2005 to 45.3% (95% CI: 42.6%-48.0%) in 2008. ITN use by children 6-30 months old, who were living in HH with at least one net, increased from 73.6% (95% CI:68.2%-79.1%) to 80.0% (95% CI:75.9%-84.1%) over the three-year period. This modest increase in ITN use was associated with a decrease in moderate to severe anaemia (Hb &lt;8 g/dl) from 18.4% (95% CI:14.9%-21.8%) in 2005 to 15.4% (13.2%-17.7%) in 2008, while parasitaemia, measured as positive-slide microscopy, decreased from 18.9% (95% CI:14.7%-23.2%) to 16.9% (95% CI:13.8%-20.0%), a relative reduction of 16% and 11%, respectively. In HF surveys, anaemia prevalence decreased from 18.3% (95% CI: 14.9%-21.7%) to 15.4% (95% CI: 12.7%-18.2%), while parasitaemia decreased from 30.6% (95% CI: 25.7%-35.5%) to 13.2% (95% CI: 10.6%-15.8%), a relative reduction of 15% and 57%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Increasing access to effective malaria prevention was associated with a reduced burden of malaria in young Malawian children. Anaemia measured at the HF level at time of routine vaccination may be a good surrogate indicator for its measurement at the HH level in evaluating national malaria control programmes.",M2
20409313,"Anopheles culicifacies breeding in brackish waters in Sri Lanka and implications for <e>malaria</e> control.BACKGROUND: Anopheles culicifacies is the major vector of both falciparum and vivax malaria in Sri Lanka, while Anopheles subpictus and certain other species function as secondary vectors. In Sri Lanka, An. culicifacies is present as a species complex consisting of species B and E, while An. subpictus exists as a complex of species A-D. The freshwater breeding habit of An. culicifacies is well established. In order to further characterize the breeding sites of the major malaria vectors in Sri Lanka, a limited larval survey was carried out at a site in the Eastern province that was affected by the 2004 Asian tsunami. METHODS: Anopheline larvae were collected fortnightly for six months from a brackish water body near Batticaloa town using dippers. Collected larvae were reared in the laboratory and the emerged adults were identified using standard keys. Sibling species status was established based on Y-chromosome morphology for An. culicifacies larvae and morphometric characteristics for An. subpictus larvae and adults. Salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH were determined at the larval collection site. RESULTS: During a six month study covering dry and wet seasons, a total of 935 anopheline larvae were collected from this site that had salinity levels up to 4 parts per thousand at different times. Among the emerged adult mosquitoes, 661 were identified as An. culicifacies s.l. and 58 as An. subpictus s.l. Metaphase karyotyping of male larvae showed the presence of species E of the Culicifacies complex, and adult morphometric analysis the presence of species B of the Subpictus complex. Both species were able to breed in water with salinity levels up to 4 ppt. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the ability of An. culicifacies species E, the major vector of falciparum and vivax malaria in Sri Lanka, to oviposit and breed in brackish water. The sibling species B in the An. subpictus complex, a well-known salt water breeder and a secondary malaria vector in the country, was also detected at the same site. Since global warming and the rise in sea levels will further increase of inland brackish water bodies, the findings have significant implications for the control of malaria in Sri Lanka and elsewhere.",M2
20403155,"Alpha-tocopherol transfer protein disruption confers resistance to malarial infection in mice.BACKGROUND: Various factors impact the severity of <e>malaria</e>, including the nutritional status of the host. Vitamin E, an intra and extracellular anti-oxidant, is one such nutrient whose absence was shown previously to negatively affect Plasmodium development. However, mechanisms of this Plasmodium inhibition, in addition to means by which to exploit this finding as a therapeutic strategy, remain unclear. METHODS: alpha-TTP knockout mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei NK65 or Plasmodium yoelii XL-17, parasitaemia, survival rate were monitored. In one part of the experiments mice were fed with a supplemented diet of vitamin E and then infected. In addition, parasite DNA damage was monitored by means of comet assay and 8-OHdG test. Moreover, infected mice were treated with chloroquine and parasitaemia and survival rate were monitored. RESULTS: Inhibition of alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP), a determinant of vitamin E concentration in circulation, confers resistance to malarial infection as a result of oxidative damage to the parasites. Furthermore, in combination with the anti-malarial drug chloroquine results were even more dramatic. CONCLUSION: Considering that these knockout mice lack observable negative impacts typical of vitamin E deficiency, these results suggest that inhibition of alpha-TTP activity in the liver may be a useful strategy in the prevention and treatment of malaria infection. Moreover, a combined strategy of alpha-TTP inhibition and chloroquine treatment might be effective against drug resistant parasites.",M2
20402811,"Associations between Helicobacter pylori infection, co-morbid infections, gastrointestinal symptoms, and circulating cytokines in African children.BACKGROUND: Refugee children have complex medical needs and often have multiple infections. The relationship between infection, gastrointestinal symptoms, and systemic inflammation is poorly understood. We investigated these parameters in refugee children with a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori, helminth, and <e>malaria</e> infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: African refugee children were recruited at resettlement health screening. Data were collected on demography, gastrointestinal symptoms, co-morbid infection, and serum for peripheral cytokine levels. Helicobacter pylori infection was diagnosed by a fecal-based immunoassay. RESULTS: Data from 163 children were analyzed, of which 84.0% were positive for H. pylori. Infected children were significantly older (9.2 years +/- 3.7 vs 7.1 years +/- 3.9, p = .01). Half the cohort (84/163, 51.5%) described gastrointestinal symptoms but these were not strongly associated with co-morbid infections. Helicobacter pylori-infected children had significantly lower circulating log-interleukin-8 (IL-8) (odds ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40, 0.94, p = .025). Helminth infections were common (75/163, 46%) and associated with elevated log-IL-5 (beta: 0.42, 95% CI 0.077, 0.76). Children with malaria (15/163, 9.2%) had elevated log-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and log-IL-10 (beta: 0.67, 95% CI 0.34, 1.0 and beta: 1.3, 95% CI 0.67, 1.9, respectively). IL-10 : IL-12 ratios were increased in H. pylori-infected children with malaria or helminth infections. Symptoms were generally not associated with levels of circulating peripheral cytokines irrespective of co-morbid infection diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of asymptomatic H. pylori infection in recently resettled African refugee children. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not predictive of H. pylori nor of helminth infections. Serum cytokines, particularly IL-5, IL-10, and TNFalpha, were significantly elevated in children with malaria and helminth infections but not in those with H. pylori infection.",M2

20398318,"Rural health centres, communities and <e>malaria</e> case detection in Zambia using mobile telephones: a means to detect potential reservoirs of infection in unstable transmission conditions.BACKGROUND: Effective malaria control depends on timely acquisition of information on new cases, their location and their frequency so as to deploy supplies, plan interventions or focus attention on specific locations appropriately to intervene and prevent an upsurge in transmission. The process is known as active case detection, but because the information is time sensitive, it is difficult to carry out. In Zambia, the rural health services are operating effectively and for the most part are provided with adequate supplies of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) as well as effective drugs for the diagnosis and treatment of malaria. The tests are administered to all prior to treatment and appropriate records are kept. Data are obtained in a timely manner and distribution of this information is important for the effective management of malaria control operations. The work reported here involves combining the process of positive diagnoses in rural health centres (passive case detection) to help detect potential outbreaks of malaria and target interventions to foci where parasite reservoirs are likely to occur. METHODS: Twelve rural health centres in the Choma and Namwala Districts were recruited to send weekly information of rapid malaria tests used and number of positive diagnoses to the Malaria Institute at Macha using mobile telephone SMS. Data were entered in excel, expressed as number of cases per rural health centre and distributed weekly to interested parties. RESULTS: These data from each of the health centres which were mapped using geographical positioning system (GPS) coordinates were used in a time sensitive manner to plot the patterns of malaria case detection in the vicinity of each location. The data were passed on to the appropriate authorities. The seasonal pattern of malaria transmission associated with local ecological conditions can be seen in the distribution of cases diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate supplies of RDT are essential in health centres and the system can be expanded throughout the country to support strategic targeting of interventions by the National Malaria Control Programme. Participation by the health centre staff was excellent.",M2
20393950,"Indoor residual spraying for preventing <e>malaria</e>.BACKGROUND: Primary malaria prevention on a large scale depends on two vector control interventions: indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs). Historically, IRS has reduced malaria transmission in many settings in the world, but the health effects of IRS have never been properly quantified. This is important, and will help compare IRS with other vector control interventions. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the impact of IRS alone, and to compare the relative impacts of IRS and ITNs, on key malariological parameters. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (September 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2009), EMBASE (1974 to September 2009), LILACS (1982 to September 2009), mRCT (September 2009), reference lists, and conference abstracts. We also contacted researchers in the field, organizations, and manufacturers of insecticides (June 2007). SELECTION CRITERIA: Cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before-and-after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) of IRS compared to no IRS or ITNs. Studies examining the impact of IRS on special groups not representative of the general population, or using insecticides and dosages not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently reviewed trials for inclusion. Two authors extracted data, assessed risk of bias and analysed the data. Where possible, we adjusted confidence intervals (CIs) for clustering. Studies were grouped into those comparing IRS with no IRS, and IRS compared with ITNs, and then stratified by malaria endemicity. MAIN RESULTS: IRS versus no IRSStable malaria (entomological inoculation rate (EIR) &gt; 1): In one RCT in Tanzania IRS reduced re-infection with malaria parasites detected by active surveillance in children following treatment; protective efficacy (PE) 54%. In the same setting, malaria case incidence assessed by passive surveillance was marginally reduced in children aged one to five years; PE 14%, but not in children older than five years (PE -2%). In the IRS group, malaria prevalence was slightly lower but this was not significant (PE 6%), but mean haemoglobin was higher (mean difference 0.85 g/dL).In one CBA trial in Nigeria, IRS showed protection against malaria prevalence during the wet season (PE 26%; 95% CI 20 to 32%) but not in the dry season (PE 6%; 95% CI -4 to 15%). In one ITS in Mozambique, the prevalence was reduced substantially over a period of 7 years (from 60 to 65% prevalence to 4 to 8% prevalence; the weighted PE before-after was 74% (95% CI 72 to 76%).Unstable malaria (EIR &lt; 1): In two RCTs, IRS reduced the incidence rate of all malaria infections;PE 31% in India, and 88% (95% CI 69 to 96%) in Pakistan. By malaria species, IRS also reduced the incidence of P. falciparum (PE 93%, 95% CI 61 to 98% in Pakistan) and P. vivax (PE 79%, 95% CI 45 to 90% in Pakistan); There were similar impacts on malaria prevalence for any infection: PE 76% in Pakistan; PE 28% in India. When looking separately by parasite species, for P. falciparum there was a PE of 92% in Pakistan and 34% in India; for P. vivax there was a PE of 68% in Pakistan and no impact demonstrated in India (PE of -2%).IRS versus Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs)Stable malaria (EIR &gt; 1): Only one RCT was done in an area of stable transmission (in Tanzania). When comparing parasitological re-infection by active surveillance after treatment in short-term cohorts, ITNs appeared better, but it was likely not to be significant as the unadjusted CIs approached 1 (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.22). When the incidence of malaria episodes was measured by passive case detection, no difference was found in children aged one to five years (risk ratio = 0.88, direction in favour of IRS). No difference was found for malaria prevalence or haemoglobin.Unstable malaria (EIR &lt; 1): Two studies; for incidence and prevalence, the malaria rates were higher in the IRS group compared to the ITN group in one study. Malaria incidence was higher in the IRS arm in India (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.48) and in South Africa (risk ratio 1.34 but the cluster unadjusted CIs included 1). For malaria prevalence, ITNs appeared to give better protection against any infection compared to IRS in India (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.70) and also for both P. falciparum (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.78) and P. vivax (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.37). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Historical and programme documentation has clearly established the impact of IRS. However, the number of high-quality trials are too few to quantify the size of effect in different transmission settings. The evidence from randomized comparisons of IRS versus no IRS confirms that IRS reduces malaria incidence in unstable malaria settings, but randomized trial data from stable malaria settings is very limited. Some limited data suggest that ITN give better protection than IRS in unstable areas, but more trials are needed to compare the effects of ITNs with IRS, as well as to quantify their combined effects.",M2
20391433,"Blood-stage Plasmodium berghei infection leads to short-lived parasite-associated antigen presentation by dendritic cells.Despite extensive evidence that Plasmodium species are capable of stimulating the immune system, the association of <e>malaria</e> with a higher incidence of other infectious diseases and reduced responses to vaccination against unrelated pathogens suggests the existence of immune suppression. Recently, we provided evidence that blood-stage Plasmodium berghei infection leads to suppression of MHC class I-restricted immunity to third party (non-malarial) antigens as a consequence of systemic DC activation. This earlier study did not, however, determine whether reactivity was also impaired to MHC class II-restricted third party antigens or to Plasmodium antigens themselves. Here, we show that while P. berghei-expressed antigens were presented early in infection, there was a rapid decline in presentation within 4 days, paralleling impairment in MHC class I- and II-restricted presentation of third party antigens. This provides important evidence that P. berghei not only causes immunosuppression to subsequently encountered third party antigens, but also rapidly limits the capacity to generate effective parasite-specific immunity.",M2

20385827,"A defunctioning polymorphism in FCGR2B is associated with protection against <e>malaria</e> but susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease more prevalent in people of African and Asian origin than Caucasian origin. FcgammaRIIb is an inhibitory Fc receptor with a critical role in immune regulation. Mouse data suggest that FcgammaRIIb deficiency increases susceptibility to autoimmune disease but protects against infection. We show that a SNP in human FCGR2B that abrogates receptor function is strongly associated with susceptibility to SLE in both Caucasians and Southeast Asians. The minor allele of this SNP is more common in Southeast Asians and Africans, populations from areas where malaria is endemic, than in Caucasians. We show that homozygosity for the minor allele is associated with substantial protection against severe malaria in an East African population (odds ratio = 0.56; P = 7.1 x 10(-5)). This protective effect against malaria may contribute to the higher frequency of this SNP and hence, SLE in Africans and Southeast Asians.",M2
20381127,"DDT contamination from indoor residual spraying for <e>malaria</e> control.The insecticide DDT is still used in specific areas of South Africa for indoor residual spray (IRS) to control malaria vectors. Local residents could be exposed to residues of DDT through various pathways including indoor air, dust, soil, food and water. The aims of this study were to determine the levels of DDT contamination, as a result of IRS, in representative homesteads, and to evaluate the possible routes of human exposure. Two villages, exposed (DV) and reference (TV) were selected. Sampling was done two months after the IRS process was completed. Twelve homesteads were selected in DV and nine in TV. Human serum, indoor air, floor dust, outside soil, potable water, leafy vegetables, and chicken samples (muscle, fat and liver) were collected and analyzed for both the o,p'- and p,p'-isomers of DDT, DDD and DDE. DDT was detected in all the media analyzed indicating a combination of potential dietary and non-dietary pathways of uptake. DV had the most samples with detectable levels of DDT and its metabolites, and with the exception of chicken muscle samples, DV also had higher mean levels for all the components analyzed compared to TV. Seventy-nine percent of participants from DV had serum levels of DDT (mean [summation operator]DDT 7.3microg g(-1) lipid). These residues constituted mainly of p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE. [summation operator]DDT levels were detected in all indoor air (mean [summation operator]DDT 3900.0 ng m(-3)) and floor dust (mean [summation operator]DDT 1200.0 microg m(-2)) samples. Levels were also detected in outside soil (mean [summation operator]DDT 25.0 microg kg(-1)) and potable water (mean [summation operator]DDT 2.0 microg L(-1)). Vegetable sample composition (mean [summation operator]DDT 43.0 microg kg(-1)) constituted mainly p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDD. Chicken samples were highly contaminated with DDT (muscle mean [summation operator]DDT 700.0 microg kg(-1), fat mean [summation operator]DDT 240,000.0 microg kg(-1), liver mean [summation operator]DDT 1600.0 microg kg(-1)).

20380748,"Community participation for <e>malaria</e> elimination in Tafea Province, Vanuatu: Part I. Maintaining motivation for prevention practices in the context of disappearing disease.BACKGROUND: In the 1990s, the experience of eliminating malaria from Aneityum Island, Vanuatu is often given as evidence for the potential to eliminate malaria in the south-west Pacific. This experience, however, cannot provide a blueprint for larger islands that represent more complex social and environmental contexts. Community support was a key contributor to success in Aneityum. In the context of disappearing disease, obtaining and maintaining community participation in strategies to eliminate malaria in the rest of Tafea Province, Vanuatu will be significantly more challenging. METHOD: Nine focus group discussions (FGDs), 12 key informant interviews (KIIs), three transect walks and seven participatory workshops were carried out in three villages across Tanna Island to investigate community perceptions and practices relating to malaria prevention (particularly relating to bed nets); influences on these practices including how malaria is contextualized within community health and disease priorities; and effective avenues for channelling health information. RESULTS: The primary protection method identified by participants was the use of bed nets, however, the frequency and motivation for their use differed between study villages on the basis of the perceived presence of malaria. Village, household and personal cleanliness were identified by participants as important for protection against malaria. Barriers and influences on bed net use included cultural beliefs and practices, travel, gender roles, seasonality of mosquito nuisance and risk perception. Health care workers and church leaders were reported to have greatest influence on malaria prevention practices. Participants preferred receiving health information through visiting community health promotion teams, health workers, church leaders and village chiefs. CONCLUSION: In low malaria transmission settings, a package for augmenting social capital and sustaining community participation for elimination will be essential and includes: 'sentinel sites' for qualitative monitoring of evolving local socio-cultural, behavioural and practical issues that impact malaria prevention and treatment; mobilizing social networks; intersectoral collaboration; integration of malaria interventions with activities addressing other community health and disease priorities; and targeted implementation of locally appropriate, multi-level, media campaigns that sustain motivation for community participation in malaria elimination.",M2
20380703,"<e>Malaria</e> knowledge and agricultural practices that promote mosquito breeding in two rural farming communities in Oyo State, Nigeria.BACKGROUND: Agricultural practices such as the use of irrigation during rice cultivation, the use of ponds for fish farming and the storage of water in tanks for livestock provide suitable breeding grounds for anthropophylic mosquitoes. The most common anthropophylic mosquito in Nigeria which causes much of the morbidity and mortality associated with malaria is the anopheles mosquito. Farmers are therefore at high risk of malaria - a disease which seriously impacts on agricultural productivity. Unfortunately information relating to agricultural practices and farmers' behavioural antecedent factors that could assist malaria programmers plan and implement interventions to reduce risk of infections among farmers is scanty. Farmers' knowledge about malaria and agricultural practices which favour the breeding of mosquitoes in Fashola and Soku, two rural farming communities in Oyo State were therefore assessed in two rural farming communities in Oyo State. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study involved the collection of data through the use of eight Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and the interview of 403 randomly selected farmers using semi-structured questionnaires. These sets of information were supplemented with observations of agricultural practices made in 40 randomly selected farms. The FGD data were recorded on audio-tapes, transcribed and subjected to content analysis while the quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Most respondents in the two communities had low level of knowledge of malaria causation as only 12.4% stated that mosquito bite could transmit the disease. Less than half (46.7%) correctly mentioned the signs and symptoms of malaria as high body temperature, body pains, headache, body weakness and cold/fever. The reported main methods for preventing mosquito bites in the farming communities included removal of heaps of cassava tuber peelings (62.3%), bush burning/clearing (54.6%) and clearing of ditches (33.7%). The dumping of cassava tuber peelings which allows the collection of pools of water in the farms storage of peeled cassava tubers soaked in water in uncovered plastic containers, digging of trenches, irrigation of farms and the presence of fish ponds were the observed major agricultural practices that favoured mosquito breeding on the farms. A significant association was observed between respondents' knowledge about malaria and agricultural practices which promote mosquito breeding. Respondents' wealth quintile level was also seen to be associated with respondents' knowledge about malaria and agricultural practices which promote mosquito breeding. CONCLUSION: Farmers' knowledge of malaria causation and signs and symptoms was low, while agricultural practices which favour mosquito breeding in the farming communities were common. There is an urgent need to engage farmers in meaningful dialogue on malaria reduction initiatives including the modification of agricultural practices which favour mosquito breeding. Multiple intervention strategies are needed to tackle the factors related to malaria prevalence and mosquito abundance in the communities.",M2

Infections with Plasmodium ovale are widely distributed but rarely investigated, and the resulting burden of disease is not known. Dimorphism in defined genes has led to P. ovale parasites being divided into classic and variant types. We hypothesized that these dimorphs represent distinct parasite species. METHODS: Multilocus sequence analysis of 6 genetic characters was carried out among 55 isolates from 12 African and 3 Asia-Pacific countries. RESULTS: Each genetic character displayed complete dimorphism and segregated perfectly between the 2 types. Both types were identified in samples from Ghana, Nigeria, São Tomé, Sierra Leone, and Uganda and have been described previously in Myanmar. Splitting of the 2 lineages is estimated to have occurred between 1.0 and 3.5 million years ago in hominid hosts. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that P. ovale comprises 2 nonrecombining species that are sympatric in Africa and Asia. We speculate on possible scenarios that could have led to this speciation. Furthermore, the relatively high frequency of imported cases of symptomatic P. ovale infection in the United Kingdom suggests that the morbidity caused by ovale malaria has been underestimated.",M2
20380310,"Using nylon strips to dispense mosquito attractants for sampling the <e>malaria</e> vector Anopheles gambiae s.s.Synthetic versions of human derived kairomones can be used as baits when trapping host seeking mosquitoes. The effectiveness of these lures depends not only on their attractiveness to the mosquitoes but also on the medium from which they are dispensed. We report on the development and evaluation of nylon strips as a method of dispensing odorants attractive to the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae s.s. (Giles). When a synthetic blend of attractants was dispensed using this method, significantly more mosquitoes were trapped than when two previous methods, open glass vials or low density polyethylene sachets were used. We conclude that the nylon strips are suitable for dispensing odorants in mosquito trapping operations and can be adopted for use in rural and remote areas. The nylon material required is cheap and widely available and the strips can be prepared without specialized equipment or electricity.",M2
20380296,"Expression and characterization of three new glutathione transferases, an epsilon (AcGSTE2-2), omega (AcGSTO1-1), and theta (AcGSTT1-1) from Anopheles cracens (Diptera: Culicidae), a major Thai <e>malaria</e> vector.Glutathione transferases (GSTs) (E.C.2.5.1.18) are multifunctional enzymes involved in the detoxification of many exogenous and endogenous compounds. This study aimed to characterize several new GSTs from Anopheles cracens, a major Thai malaria vector formerly known as Anopheles dirus. The three recombinant enzymes obtained were from the epsilon, theta and omega classes. They showed 80-93% identity to orthologous An. gambiae GSTs. AcGSTE2-2 possessed peroxidase activity that cannot be detected for the An. gambiae AgGSTE2-2. AcGSTT1-1 had high activity toward several substrates that are specific for mammalian theta class. The AcGSTO1-1 can use 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, dichloroacetic acid, and hydroxyethyl disulfide substrates. The enzymes bound but did not metabolize the organophosphate temephos. The epsilon AcGSTE2-2 functioned as a peroxidase and DDT metabolizing enzyme. The theta AcGSTT1-1 functioned not only as peroxidase but also acted as a binding protein for organophosphates. The omega GST had thiol transferase activity suggesting a role in oxidative stress response.",M2

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of women presenting for delivery in two hospitals was conducted during November-December 2006. Data collected included sociodemographic information, medical and obstetric histories, and anthropometric measures. Laboratory investigations for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum and intestinal helminths, and tests for hemoglobin levels were also performed. RESULTS: The stillbirth rate was relatively high in this population (5%). Most of the stillbirths were fresh and 24% were macerated. When compared to women with no malaria, women with malaria had increased risk of stillbirth (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2-9.3). Other factors associated with stillbirth were severe anemia, low serum folate concentration, past induced abortion, and history of stillbirth. CONCLUSION: The fact that most of the stillbirths were fresh suggests that higher quality intrapartum care could reduce stillbirth rates.",M2

20362381,"'Like sugar and honey': the embedded ethics of a larval control project in The Gambia.This paper describes a <e>malaria</e> research project in The Gambia to provoke thinking on the social value of transnational research. The Larval Control Project (LCP) investigated the efficacy of a microbial insecticide to reduce vector density and, ultimately, clinical malaria in Gambian children. The LCP's protocol delineated a clinical surveillance scheme that involved Village Health Workers (VHWs) supported by project nurses. Combining insights from ethnographic fieldwork conducted at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratories in Farafenni from 2005 to 2009, open-ended interviews with project nurses, and eight focus group discussions held with participant mothers in October 2007, we consider the social impact of the LCP's investigative method against the backdrop of several years of research activity. We found that while participants associated the LCP with the clinical care it provided, they also regarded the collaboration between the nurses and VHWs added additional benefits. Organised around the operational functions of the trial, small-scale collaborations provided the platform from which to build local capacity. While ethical guidelines emphasise the considerations that must be added to experimental endeavour in southern countries (e.g. elaborating processes of informed consent, developing strategies of community engagement or providing therapeutic access to participants after the trial concludes), these findings suggest that shifting attention from supplementing ethical protocols to the everyday work of research -embedding ethics through scientific activity - may provide a sounder basis to reinforce the relationship between scientific rigour and social value.",M2

20350312,"Polymorphisms in genes of interleukin 12 and its receptors and their association with protection against severe malarial anaemia in children in western Kenya.BACKGROUND: Malarial anaemia is characterized by destruction of <e>malaria</e> infected red blood cells and suppression of erythropoiesis. Interleukin 12 (IL12) significantly boosts erythropoietic responses in murine models of malarial anaemia and decreased IL12 levels are associated with severe malarial anaemia (SMA) in children. Based on the biological relevance of IL12 in malaria anaemia, the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of IL12 and its receptors and SMA was examined. METHODS: Fifty-five tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms covering genes encoding two IL12 subunits, IL12A and IL12B, and its receptors, IL12RB1 and IL12RB2, were examined in a cohort of 913 children residing in Asembo Bay region of western Kenya. RESULTS: An increasing copy number of minor variant (C) in IL12A (rs2243140) was significantly associated with a decreased risk of SMA (P = 0.006; risk ratio, 0.52 for carrying one copy of allele C and 0.28 for two copies). Individuals possessing two copies of a rare variant (C) in IL12RB1 (rs429774) also appeared to be strongly protective against SMA (P = 0.00005; risk ratio, 0.18). In addition, children homozygous for another rare allele (T) in IL12A (rs22431348) were associated with reduced risk of severe anaemia (SA) (P = 0.004; risk ratio, 0.69) and of severe anaemia with any parasitaemia (SAP) (P = 0.004; risk ratio, 0.66). In contrast, AG genotype for another variant in IL12RB1 (rs383483) was associated with susceptibility to high-density parasitaemia (HDP) (P = 0.003; risk ratio, 1.21). CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown strong associations between polymorphisms in the genes of IL12A and IL12RB1 and protection from SMA in Kenyan children, suggesting that human genetic variants of IL12 related genes may significantly contribute to the development of anaemia in malaria patients.",M2

Because laboratory testing is often unavailable in rural areas, the cost-benefit and viability of this approach may depend on accurately diagnosing malaria by using clinical criteria. We assessed the accuracy of syndromic diagnosis for malaria in three peripheral health units in rural Sierra Leone and determined factors that were associated with an accurate malaria diagnosis. Of 175 children diagnosed with malaria on syndromic grounds, 143 (82%) were confirmed by the Paracheck-Pf test. In a multivariate analysis, splenomegaly (P = 0.04) was the only clinical sign significantly associated with laboratory-confirmed malaria, and sleeping under a bed net was protective (P = 0.05). Our findings show that clinical malaria is diagnosed relatively accurately in rural Sierra Leone. Incorporating bed net use and splenomegaly into the national Integrated Management of Childhood Illness guidelines for evaluation of fever may further enhance diagnostic accuracy for malaria.",M2
20337112,"[Imported <e>malaria</e> in Tunisia: consequences on the risk of resurgence of the disease]Although malaria has been eradicated in Tunisia since 1979, the disease is still a health issue due to the persistence of mosquitoes and coexistence with a potential parasite reservoir in the form of imported cases. From 1999 to 2006, 98 cases of imported malaria were diagnosed at the Pasteur Institute in Tunis where nearly 30% of national cases are recorded. Tunisians accounted for 24.5% of these cases versus 75.5% involving foreigners. The occurrence rate has steadily increased in volunteer workers, businessmen, diplomats and athletes who together accounted for 41.7% of cases in 1995 as compared to only 17.4% in 1980 (p&lt;0.01). Most cases (96.5%) were imported from sub-Saharan Africa. The most frequent countries involved in importation were Cote d'Ivoire (23 cases) and Mali (8 cases) that are now linked to Tunisia by regular flights. About one third of patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. This finding underlines the importance of recommending systematic screening in high-risk groups. Fever (70.6%) and gastro-intestinal manifestations (27.9%) were the most frequent clinical findings in the 69 symptomatic cases. Plasmodium falciparum (71.4%) was the most common species followed by Plasmodium ovale (19.4%). Gametocytes were detected in 9.2% of subjects, thus creating a theoretical source of infection for mosquitoes especially since 60.2% of all cases were recorded between June and October when mosquitoes are active in Tunisia. Due to increasing exchange with endemic malaria areas in Africa that has resulted in a higher incidence of imported cases and a futher risk of introduction of tropical mosquito species as well as to global warming that promotes plasmodium transmission, greater vigilance is necessary to ensure eradication of malaria in Tunisia.",M2

Evaluation focused on three study areas: (i) organizational efficiency and effectiveness of the Global Fund, (ii) effectiveness of the Global Fund partner environment, (iii) system effects of the Global Fund and impact of increased funding on the level of response to the three diseases. Findings can be summed up as follows: the Global Fund has been successful in mobilizing additional funding and in attracting new players. However, the demand-driven model used for allocation of funding is poorly adapted to epidemiological profiles with regard to population, persons at highest risk, and number of persons affected by the disease. The partner environment of the Global Fund, involving UN technical partners and institutions cooperating in development has failed to produce planned results due to weak institutional capacity of recipients and health systems overall, as well as little synergy and coordination work between international partners. Increased financial resources have allowed rapid expansion of prevention and care services for the three diseases. Spectacular results have been achieved against malaria in Eastern African countries, but little progress has been made in the collective effort to slow down the spread of HIV/AIDS. In preparation for the upcoming Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund and prior to any further decisions to expand the use of innovative financing instruments for development, the author of this article calls the attention of policy-makers on the need to ensure the development of accompanying strategies to increase the effectiveness and impact of these instruments.",M2

The concentrations of artemisinin in the extracts was up to 20-fold higher than that in a herbal tea prepared from the dried herb, but the amount of total artemisinin extracted by the Chinese methods was much less than that removed in the herbal tea. While both extracts exhibited potent in vitro activities against Plasmodium falciparum, only the pounded juice contained sufficient artemisinin to suppress parasitaemia in P. berghei infected mice.

Field information is available for both Olyset(R) and PermaNet((R)), with limited data on the newer LLINs. To address this gap, a field evaluation was carried out to determine the acceptability and durability of Interceptor((R)) LLINs. METHODS: A one-year prospective field study was conducted in eight rural returnee villages in Liberia. Households were randomized to receive Interceptor((R)) LLINs or conventionally treated nets (CTNs). Primary outcomes were levels of residual alpha-cypermethrin measured by HPLC and participant utilization/acceptability of the ITNs. RESULTS: A total of 398 nets were analysed for residual alpha-cypermethrin. The median baseline concentrations of insecticide were 175.5 mg/m2 for the Interceptor((R)) LLIN and 21.8 mg/m2 for the CTN. Chemical residue loss after a one year follow-up period was 22% and 93% respectively. Retention and utilization of nets remained high (94%) after one year, irrespective of type, while parasitaemia prevalence decreased from 29.7% at baseline to 13.6% during the follow up survey (p = &lt; 0.001). Interview and survey data show perceived effectiveness of ITNs was just as important as other physical attributes in influencing net utilization. CONCLUSION: Interceptor((R)) LLINs are effective and desirable in rural communities in Liberia. Consideration for end user preferences should be incorporated into product development of all LLINs in the future, in order to achieve optimum retention and utilization.",M2
20334637,"Insecticide resistance status in Anopheles gambiae in southern Benin.BACKGROUND: The emergence of pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae has become a serious concern to the future success of <e>malaria</e> control. In Benin, the National Malaria Control Programme has recently planned to scaling up long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria prevention. It is, therefore, crucial to monitor the level and type of insecticide resistance in An. gambiae, particularly in southern Benin where reduced efficacy of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and IRS has previously been reported. METHODS: The protocol was based on mosquito collection during both dry and rainy seasons across forty districts selected in southern Benin. Bioassay were performed on adults collected from the field to assess the susceptibility of malaria vectors to insecticide-impregnated papers (permethrin 0.75%, delthamethrin 0.05%, DDT 4%, and bendiocarb 0.1%) following WHOPES guidelines. The species within An. gambiae complex, molecular form and presence of kdr and ace-1 mutations were determined by PCR. RESULTS: Strong resistance to permethrin and DDT was found in An. gambiae populations from southern Benin, except in Aglangandan where mosquitoes were fully susceptible (mortality 100%) to all insecticides tested. PCR showed the presence of two sub-species of An. gambiae, namely An. gambiae s.s, and Anopheles melas, with a predominance for An. gambiae s.s (98%). The molecular M form of An. gambiae was predominant in southern Benin (97%). The kdr mutation was detected in all districts at various frequency (1% to 95%) whereas the Ace-1 mutation was found at a very low frequency (&lt;or= 5%). CONCLUSION: This study showed a widespread resistance to permethrin in An. gambiae populations from southern Benin, with a significant increase of kdr frequency compared to what was observed previously in Benin. The low frequency of Ace-1 recorded in all populations is encouraging for the use of bendiocarb as an alternative insecticide to pyrethroids for IRS in Benin.",M2

Mosquitoes were collected periodically with a dry-ice-tent trap and a blacklight trap during the mosquito season (April-October) in 2008. Anopheles sinensis (94.9%) was the most abundant species collected, followed by Anopheles belenrae (3.8%), Anopheles pullus (1.2%), and Anopheles lesteri (0.1%). Hibernating Anopheles mosquitoes were also collected from December 2007 to March 2008. An. pullus (72.1%) was the most frequently collected, followed by An. sinensis (18.4%) and An. belenrae (9.5%). The composition of Anopheles species differed between the mosquito season and hibernation seasons. The parous rate fluctuated from 0% to 92.9%, and the highest rate was recorded on 10 September 2008. Sporozoite infections were detected by PCR in the head and thorax of female Anopheles mosquitoes. The annual sporozoite rate of mosquitoes was 0.11% (2 of 1,845 mosquitoes). The 2 mosquitoes that tested positive for sporozoites were An. sinensis. Malarial infections in anopheline mosquitoes from a population pool were also tried irrespective of the mosquito species. Nine of 2,331 pools of Anopheles mosquitoes were positive. From our study, it can be concluded that An. sinensis, which was the predominant vector species and confirmed as sporozoite-infected, plays an important role in malaria transmission in Ganghwa-do.",M2

The present study examined and compared the immune responses of NIH mice in either single or mixed infections with avirulent (DK) or virulent (DS) strains of Plasmodium chabaudi adami using the ELISA test for detecting and measurement of cytokines and antibody production. In both single and mixed infections, the study showed that both cell- and antibody-mediated responses were activated. In all experiments, an early relatively high level of IFN-gamma and IgG2a during the acute phase of the infection, and later elevation of IL-4 and IgG1, suggested that there was a sequential Th1/Th2 response. However, in the avirulent DK strain infection a stronger Th1 response was observed compared to the virulent DS strain-infection or in mixed infections. In the virulent DS infection, there was a stronger Th2 response compared to that in the DK and mixed infections. The faster proliferation rate of the virulent DS strain compared to the DK strain was also evident.",M2
20332090,"An acid-loading chloride transport pathway in the intraerythrocytic <e>malaria</e> parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.The intraerythrocytic malaria parasite exerts tight control over its ionic composition. In this study, a combination of fluorescent ion indicators and (36)Cl(-) flux measurements was used to investigate the transport of Cl(-) and the Cl(-)-dependent transport of  H(+)-equivalents  in mature (trophozoite stage) parasites, isolated from their host erythrocytes. Removal of extracellular Cl(-), resulting in an outward [Cl(-)] gradient, gave rise to a cytosolic alkalinization (i.e. a net efflux of H(+)-equivalents). This was reversed on restoration of extracellular Cl(-). The flux of H(+)-equivalents was inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and, when measured in ATP-depleted parasites, showed a pronounced dependence on the pH of the parasite cytosol; the flux was low at cytosolic pH values &lt; 7.2 but increased steeply with cytosolic pH at values &gt; 7.2. (36)Cl(-) influx measurements revealed the presence of a Cl(-) uptake mechanism with characteristics similar to those of the Cl(-)-dependent H(+)-equivalent flux. The intracellular concentration of Cl(-) in the parasite was estimated to be approximately 48 mm in situ. The data are consistent with the intraerythrocytic parasite having in its plasma membrane a 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive transporter that, under physiological conditions, imports Cl(-) together with H(+)-equivalents, resulting in an intracellular Cl(-) concentration well above that which would occur if Cl(-) ions were distributed passively in accordance with the parasite's large, inwardly negative membrane potential.",M2
20331433,"Antibiotics in <e>malaria</e> therapy and their effect on the parasite apicoplast.The impact of selected antibiotics on combating malaria infections was discovered in the mid of last century. Only recently, studies on their modes of action in malaria parasites have been initiated, prompted by the discovery of a prokaryotic organelle, the apicoplast. This plastid-derived structure, which originates from a secondary endosymbiotic event, possesses important metabolic as well as housekeeping functions, including fatty acid and heme biosynthesis. Due to its indispensability for parasite survival it represents a promising target for the use of antibiotics in malaria therapy. Most antibiotics cause a delayed death phenotype, which manifests in the late onset of antimalarial activity during the second replication cycle of the pathogen. This review will describe the effect of classical antibacterial agents against malaria parasites and the use of some of these compounds in clinical settings. Firstly we discuss the current knowledge about the physiological and morphological effects of antibiotics on the parasite and the apicoplast in particular, with special focus on the delayed death effect. Secondly antimalarial antibiotics are specified and their effects in vitro are compared with available in vivo data and clinical studies. Major precautions and side effects are described.",M2

With the objective of studying malaria in pregnancy, a cross-sectional, descriptive epidemiological study was carried out on 449 women, in mining areas of the San Isidro parish, municipality Sifontes, state of Bolívar, Venezuela, during 2005-2006. The Malaria incidence in pregnant women was 27.4%: 87% for Plasmodium vivax, 12.2% Plasmodium falciparum and 0.8% mixed infections. These infections appeared mainly during the second trimester (41.5%). Of the women studied, 71.5% presented symptoms and 26.2% had anemia. A higher proportion of abortions occurred among infected mothers with Plasmodium vivax (3/5); and there were 3.3% low-birth-weight neonates. A case of placental malaria (0.8%) for Plasmodium vivax was registered. An association was observed between mothers receiving chemoprophylaxis and the adequate weight of newborns (chi2 = 41 23gl. p &lt; 0.0001), independently of the regularity of treatment. It is concluded that the routine administration of antimalarial quimioprophilaxis against P. vivax to pregnant women, could be justified in endemic areas.

The objectives of this study were to assess the completeness of autochthonous malaria notification forms; to estimate the incidence trends of autochthonous cases in the State of São Paulo from 1980 to 2007; and to analyze the clinical and epidemiological patterns of cases in two autochthonous regions over this period. METHODS: This was a descriptive study that analyzed 18 variables on the notification form for malaria in the State of São Paulo, comparing these two regions over two periods (1980-1993 and 1994-2007). The data sources were SUCEN/SES/SP, SINAN/CVE/SES/SP and DATASUS. RESULTS: The completeness was greater than 85% for 11 variables. The incidence trend was decreasing. There were 821 autochthonous cases: 91.6% occurred in the eastern region, predominantly due to Plasmodium vivax. Asymptomatic infection had a higher percentage in the second period (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The completeness of the information was satisfactory. The clinical differences observed deserve attention from epidemiological surveillance agencies, which need to deal with the challenge of asymptomatic infection by Plasmodium.",M2
20302674,"Mapping <e>malaria</e> incidence distribution that accounts for environmental factors in Maputo Province--Mozambique.BACKGROUND: The objective was to study if an association exists between the incidence of malaria and some weather parameters in tropical Maputo province, Mozambique. METHODS: A Bayesian hierarchical model to malaria count data aggregated at district level over a two years period is formulated. This model made it possible to account for spatial area variations. The model was extended to include environmental covariates temperature and rainfall. Study period was then divided into two climate conditions: rainy and dry seasons. The incidences of malaria between the two seasons were compared. Parameter estimation and inference were carried out using MCMC simulation techniques based on Poisson variation. Model comparisons are made using DIC. RESULTS: For winter season, in 2001 the temperature covariate with estimated value of -8.88 shows no association to malaria incidence. In year 2002, the parameter estimation of the same covariate resulted in 5.498 of positive level of association. In both years rainfall covariate determines no dependency to malaria incidence. Malaria transmission is higher in wet season with both covariates positively related to malaria with posterior means 1.99 and 2.83 in year 2001. For 2002 only temperature is associated to malaria incidence with estimated value 2.23. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of malaria in year 2001, presents an independent spatial pattern for temperature in summer and for rainfall in winter seasons respectively. In year 2002 temperature determines the spatial pattern of malaria incidence in the region. Temperature influences the model in cases where both covariates are introduced in winter and summer season. Its influence is extended to the summer model with temperature covariate only. It is reasonable to state that with the occurrence of high temperatures, malaria incidence had certainly escalated in this year.",M2
20301065,"Health impact of the 2004 Andaman Nicobar earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.BACKGROUND: The human impact of the tsunami that occurred on 26 December 2004 was enormous, with Indonesia bearing a huge proportion of the losses. The aftermath brought predictions of communicable disease outbreaks and widespread fear of epidemics. However, evidence from previous disasters due to natural hazards does not support all of these predictions. The objectives of this study were to: (1) describe the relative importance of infectious diseases and injuries as a consequence of a disaster due to natural hazards; and (2) identify key recommendations for the improvement of control and surveillance of these diseases during and after disasters. METHODS: A team from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters visited Jakarta and Banda Aceh from 11-23 January 2005, and collected data from the Central and Provincial Ministries of Health (MOH), the World Health Organization (WHO), and a field hospital from the International Committee of the Red Cross in Banda Aceh. The epidemiological profiles of diseases before and after the tsunami were compared. Cholera, tetanus, wounds and wound infections, acute respiratory infections, <e>malaria</e>, and dengue were included in this analysis. RESULTS: Certain diseases (e.g., cholera, malaria, dengue) are not always an immediate priority post-disaster. Rates of disaster-related health conditions requiring emergency response fell by half, and became negligible around four weeks after the precipitating events. Some conditions, such as aspiration pneumonia and tetanus, which normally are rare, require special preparedness for emergency personnel. In addition, resistant and rare pathogens are associated with disasters due to natural hazards in the tropics and require specialized knowledge for the rapid and successful treatment of related infections. CONCLUSIONS: Within the first four weeks of a disaster, international humanitarian agencies in the health sector should start working with the MOH. The WHO surveillance system established immediately after the tsunami offers lessons for developing a prototype for future emergencies. Guidelines for tetanus and aspiration pneumonia should be included in disaster medicine handbooks, and humanitarian aid groups should be prepared to provide emergency obstetrics and post-natal services. Relief funding after naturally occurring disasters should consider funding sustainability. Donors should know when to stop providing emergency relief funds and transition to recovery/development strategies.",M2
20309445,"Transmission-mode direct analysis in real time and desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of insecticide-treated bednets for <e>malaria</e> control.Transmission-mode direct analysis in real time (TM-DART) is presented as an alternative sampling strategy to traditional methods of sample introduction for DART MS analysis. A custom-designed sample holder was fabricated to rapidly and reproducibly position insecticide-treated nets normal to the ionizing metastable gas stream, enabling transmission of desorbed analyte ions through the holder cavity and into the MS. Introduction of the sample at this fixed geometry eliminates the need for optimizing sample position and allows spectra based on factors such as metastable gas temperature and flow to be systematically evaluated. The results presented here, supported by computational fluid dynamic simulations, demonstrate the effects of these factors on the resulting mass spectra and the potential of this sampling strategy to be used for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Transmission-mode desorption electrospray ionization (TM-DESI) experiments on similar insecticide-treated nets were performed for comparison purposes.",M2
20307316,"Up- and down-modulation of liver cytochrome P450 activities and associated events in two murine <e>malaria</e> models.BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which malaria up and down-regulates CYP activities are not understood yet. It is also unclear whether CYP activities are modulated during non-lethal malaria infections. This study was undertaken to evaluate the time course of CYP alterations in lethal (Plasmodium berghei ANKA) and non-lethal (Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi) murine malaria. Additionally, hypotheses on the association of CYP depression with enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production, and of CYP2a5 induction with endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, enhanced haem metabolism and oxidative stress were examined as well. METHODS: Female DBA-2 and C57BL/6 mice were infected with P.berghei ANKA or P. chabaudi and killed at different post-infection days. Infection was monitored by parasitaemia rates and clinical signs. NO levels were measured in the serum. Activities of CYP1a (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase), 2b (benzyloxyresorufin-O-debenzylase), 2a5 (coumarin-7-hydroxylase) and uridine-diphosphoglucuronyl-transferase (UGT) were determined in liver microsomes. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity and concentrations of gluthatione (GSH) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were determined in the liver. Levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) were evaluated by immunoblotting, while mRNAs of haemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Plasmodium berghei depressed CYP1a and 2b and induced 2a5 in DBA-2 mice. In P.berghei-infected C57BL/6 mice CYP activities remained unaltered. In both strains, GST and UGT were not affected by P.berghei. Plasmodium c. chabaudi depressed CYP1a and 2b and induced 2a5 activities on the day of peak parasitaemia or near this day. CYP2a5 induction was associated with over-expression of HO-1 and enhanced oxidative stress, but it was not associated with GRP78 induction, a marker of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Plasmodium chabaudi increased serum NO on days near the parasitaemia peak in both strains. Although not elevating serum NO, P.berghei enhanced iNOS mRNA expression in the liver. CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of CYP1a and 2b and induction of 2a5 occurred in lethal and non-lethal infections when parasitaemia rates were high. A contribution of NO for depression of CYP2b cannot be ruled out. Results were consistent with the view that CYP2a5 and HO-1 are concurrently up-regulated and suggested that CYP2a5 induction may occur in the absence of enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress.",M2
