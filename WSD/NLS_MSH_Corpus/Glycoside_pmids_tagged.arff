20131034,"Gene expression profiling of the proliferative effect of periplocin on mouse cardiac microvascular endothelial cells.OBJECTIVE: Periplocin is an active digitalis-like component from Cortex Periplocae, which has been widely used in the treatment of heart diseases in China for many years. According to the recommendations on the cardiovascular effect of periplocin from in vivo experiments, subsequent in vitro experiments are greatly needed for the global assessment of periplocin. The objective of this study is to investigate the cell proliferation effect and the mechanism of periplocin on endothelial cells. METHODS: The proliferative activity of periplocin (0.4, 2, 10, 50, 250 micromol/L; 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 h) was investigated by a comparison with the well-reported cardiac <e>glycoside</e>, ouabain, on mouse cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC). 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation and viability. Subsequently, cDNA microarray experiments were performed on periplocin- (50 micromol/L) and ouabain- (50 micromol/L) treated cells, and data was analyzed by ArrayTrack software. RESULTS: Periplocin could increase cell viability to a level lower than ouabain in the MTT analysis, but decrease LDH release simultaneously. The BrdU incorporation assay showed an increase in cell proliferation with 2-50 micromol/L periplocin. Genes related to protein serine/threonine kinase were the most significantly enriched in the 160 genes identified in periplocin versus the control. In the 165 genes regulated by periplocin versus ouabain, GTP-binding was the most altered term. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated the proliferation action of periplocin on CMEC. Meanwhile, its lower cytotoxicity compared to ouabain provides a new insight into the treatment of heart failure.",M1
20016840,"Cardiac <e>glycosides</e> induce cell death in human cells by inhibiting general protein synthesis.BACKGROUND: Cardiac glycosides are Na(+)/K(+)-pump inhibitors widely used to treat heart failure. They are also highly cytotoxic, and studies have suggested specific anti-tumor activity leading to current clinical trials in cancer patients. However, a definitive demonstration of this putative anti-cancer activity and the underlying molecular mechanism has remained elusive. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using an unbiased transcriptomics approach, we found that cardiac glycosides inhibit general protein synthesis. Protein synthesis inhibition and cytotoxicity were not specific for cancer cells as they were observed in both primary and cancer cell lines. These effects were dependent on the Na(+)/K(+)-pump as they were rescued by expression of a cardiac glycoside-resistant Na(+)/K(+)-pump. Unlike human cells, rodent cells are largely resistant to cardiac glycosides in vitro and mice were found to tolerate extremely high levels. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The physiological difference between human and mouse explains the previously observed sensitivity of human cancer cells in mouse xenograft experiments. Thus, published mouse xenograft models used to support anti-tumor activity for these drugs require reevaluation. Our finding that cardiac glycosides inhibit protein synthesis provides a mechanism for the cytotoxicity of CGs and raises concerns about ongoing clinical trials to test CGs as anti-cancer agents in humans.",M1
19874809,"2'-epi-2'-O-Acetylthevetin B extracted from seeds of Cerbera manghas L. induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells.2'-epi-2'-O-Acetylthevetin B (GHSC-74) is a cardiac <e>glycoside</e> isolated from the seeds of Cerbera manghas L. We have demonstrated that GHSC-74 reduced the viability of HepG2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The present study was designed to explore cellular mechanisms whereby GHSC-74 led to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Cell cycle flow cytometry demonstrated that HepG2 cells treated with GHSC-74 (4microM) resulted in S and G2 phase arrest in a time-dependent manner, as confirmed by mitotic index analysis. G2 phase arrest was accompanied with down-regulation of CDC2 and Cyclin B1 protein. Furthermore, GHSC-74-induced apoptotic killing, as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation, DAPI staining, and flow cytometric detection of sub-G1 DNA content in HepG2 cells. GHSC-74 treatment resulted in a significant increase in reactive oxygen species, activation of caspase-9, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondrion to the nucleus in HepG2 cells. Nevertheless, after GHSC-74 exposure, no significant Fas and FasL up-regulation was observed in HepG2 cells by flow cytometry. In addition, treatment with antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk partially prevented apoptosis but did not abrogate GHSC-74-induced nuclear translocation of AIF. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that GHSC-74 inhibited growth of HepG2 cells by inducing S and G2 phase arrest of the cell cycle and by triggering apoptosis via mitochondrial disruption including both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways, and ROS generation.",M1
19751721,"Isoform specificity of cardiac <e>glycosides</e> binding to human Na+,K+-ATPase alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1.Cardiac glycosides inhibit the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and are used for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. In human heart three isoforms of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase are expressed: alpha(1)beta(1), alpha(2)beta(1) and alpha(3)beta(1). It is unknown, if clinically used cardiac glycosides differ in isoform specific affinities, and if the isoforms have specific subcellular localization in human cardiac myocytes. Human Na(+),K(+)-ATPase isoforms alpha(1)beta(1), alpha(2)beta(1) and alpha(3)beta(1) were expressed in yeast which has no endogenous Na(+),K(+)-ATPase. Isoform specific affinities of digoxin, digitoxin, beta-acetyldigoxin, methyldigoxin and ouabain were assessed in [(3)H]-ouabain binding assays in the absence or presence of K(+) (each n=5). The subcellular localizations of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase isoforms were investigated in isolated human atrial cardiomyocytes by immunohistochemistry. In the absence of K(+), methyldigoxin (alpha(1)&gt;alpha(3)&gt;alpha(2)) and ouabain (alpha(1)=alpha(3)&gt;alpha(2)) showed distinct isoform specific affinities, while for digoxin, digitoxin and beta-acetyldigoxin no differences were found. In the presence of K(+), also digoxin (alpha(2)=alpha(3)&gt;alpha(1)) and beta-acetyldigoxin (alpha(1)&gt;alpha(3)) had isoform specificities. A comparison between the cardiac glycosides demonstrated highly different affinity profiles for the isoforms. Immunohistochemistry showed that all three isoforms are located in the plasma membrane and in intracellular membranes, but only alpha(1)beta(1) and alpha(2)beta(1) are located in the T-tubuli. Cardiac glycosides show distinct isoform specific affinities and different affinity profiles to Na(+),K(+)-ATPase isoforms which have different subcellular localizations in human cardiomyocytes. Thus, in contrast to current notion, different cardiac glycoside agents may significantly differ in their pharmacological profile which could be of hitherto unknown clinical relevance.",M1
19687166,"Sodium-hydrogen exchange inhibition attenuates <e>glycoside</e>-induced hypertrophy in rat ventricular myocytes.AIMS: Cardiac glycosides induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via yet to be defined mechanisms. These hypertrophic effects are likely related to changes in intracellular signalling secondary to Na(+)-K(+) ATPase (NKA) inhibition which would produce elevations in intracellular sodium concentrations. Sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform 1 (NHE-1) also contributes to intracellular sodium regulation. Accordingly, we determined the contribution of NHE-1 to cardiac glycoside-induced hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: The majority of the experiments were performed on cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes exposed to either ouabain (100 microM) or digoxin (40 microM) for 24 h, although additional experiments were also done using adult left ventricular myocytes with 30 microM of either glycoside. Both glycosides increased cell surface area by 30% and atrial natriuretic peptide gene expression by two- to three-fold (P &lt; 0.05 for both). These effects were associated with a significant reduction in the expression of two NKA isoforms, alpha(2) and alpha(3), whereas the alpha(1) isoform was unaffected. Conversely, both glycosides increased NHE-1 expression in cardiomyocytes by approximately two-fold and significantly increased intracellular sodium concentrations by more than 60% (P &lt; 0.05). Both ouabain and digoxin were also found to significantly increase phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. All these effect were prevented when identical experiments were carried out in the presence of the NHE-1 inhibitors EMD 87580 or AVE 4890. Identical results were obtained using adult myocytes, although this was associated with downregulation of all three NKA isoforms. Glycoside-induced increase in cell shortening or intracellular Ca(2+) transients was not significantly affected by NHE-1 inhibition. CONCLUSION: When taken together, these studies show that NHE-1 inhibition attenuates the hypertrophic effect of cardiac glycosides without affecting inotropic parameters and suggest a possible approach to limiting glycoside-induced hypertrophic responses while preserving therapeutic, i.e. inotropic, actions.",M1
19679550,"Cardiac <e>glycosides</e> inhibit p53 synthesis by a mechanism relieved by Src or MAPK inhibition.p53 is regulated at multiple levels. We report here that p53, in multiple lines of human cancer cells, is down-regulated by cardiac glycoside drugs digoxin and ouabain, potent inhibitors of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. These drugs reduced the basal levels of p53 protein at nanomolar concentrations in a dose-, time-, and cancer cell line-dependent manner, but independent of p53 status of wild-type or mutant. The drugs also reduced the levels of p53 induced by its activators as well as p53 transfected into human cancer cells, regardless of its status. Interestingly, the drugs had no effect on endogenous p53 in two immortalized human cell lines. Mechanistically, p53 reduction occurred not at the mRNA levels but at the protein levels, as a result of reduced protein synthesis rather than enhanced degradation. The cellular sensitivity to drug-induced p53 reduction was not associated with the levels of alphasubunits of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in different cell lines. Although lowering extracellular K(+) did not reduce p53 as did ouabain and digoxin, it did potentiate both digoxin- and ouabain-induced p53 reduction in sensitive lines. Finally, p53 reduction seems to be triggered by activation of Src/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways upon drug binding to the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and can be completely blocked by the inhibitors of Src or MAP/ERK kinase. This is the first report that cardiac glycoside drugs, by initiating the Src/MAPK signaling pathways, reduce the p53 levels via inhibition of p53 protein synthesis. The drugs may be useful in the treatment of human cancers with a gain-of-function p53 mutation.",M1
19524689,"2'-Epi-2'-O-acetylthevetin B induces apoptosis partly via Ca(2+)-mediated mitochondrial pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells.2'-Epi-2'-O-acetylthevetin B (GHSC-74), a cardiac <e>glycoside</e>, can be isolated from the seeds of Cerbera manghas L. We demonstrated that GHSC-74 reduced the viability of HepG2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and efficiently induced apoptosis without significantly decreasing the viability of Chang human liver cells and Swiss albino 3T3 fibroblasts, as indicated by annexin-V/PI binding assay and Hoechst 33342 staining. In addition, stimulation of HepG2 cells with GHSC-74 induced a series of intracellular events: (1) loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; (2) sustained elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+]; and (3) downregulation of Bcl-2. BAPTA-AM, a cytosolic Ca2+ chelator, partly suppressed cell death and prevented mitochondrial membrane potential from losing in GHSC-74-treated HepG2 cells. In contrast, EGTA, an extracellular Ca2+ chelator, exhibited a weaker effect as compared to that of BAPTA-AM. Taken together, the Ca(2+)-mediated mitochondrial pathway was found to be involved in GHSC-74-induced HepG2 cell apoptosis.",M1
19487957,"Inhibition of the alpha1beta1 isoform of the Na, K-ATPase by 8-methoxycoumestrol without positive inotropic effect in human myocardium--novel aspects of cardiac <e>glycoside</e> pharmacology.BACKGROUND: The Na,K-ATPase (NKA) is necessary for maintaining the resting membrane potential by transporting Na and K ions across the cell membrane. Although its 3 isoforms expressed in human heart (alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1, and alpha3beta1) possess similar biochemical properties, their specific functions in human tissues remain unknown. In our search for an isoform-specific agent, which can serve to identify isoform-specific functions, we examined 8-methoxycoumestrol in its ability to inhibit the NKA and to produce inotropism in connection with the possibility to identify the NKA isoform-specific functions. METHODS AND RESULTS: In radioligand binding experiments (membrane preparations of yeast expressing isoforms alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1, and alpha3beta1; backdoor phosphorylation; and [H]-ouabain, n = 3), 8-methoxycoumestrol (1-10 microM) produced no or only little inhibition of specific ouabain binding. However, when NKA activity of the alpha1beta1 isoform was measured in membrane preparations from human kidney (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-coupled assay, n = 3), a concentration-dependent full inhibition of the activity was induced by 8-methoxycoumestrol (IC50: 90 +/- 97 nM), similar to that observed for classical cardiac glycosides digitoxin, digoxin, methyldigoxin, and beta-acetyldigoxin (IC50 = 287 +/- 190 nM, 409 +/- 171 nM, 282 +/- 482 nM, 587 +/- 135 nM, P &gt; 0.05). However, unlike the classical cardiac glycosides, 8-methoxycoumestrol did not increase cardiac contractility of electrically stimulated human right atrial trabeculae. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that 8-methoxycoumestrol inhibits the human alpha1beta1 NKA by a mechanism different to that of cardiac glycosides. In addition, the inhibition of the alpha1beta1 NKA activity seems not sufficient to evoke positive inotropy in human trabeculae, indicating that either the positive inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides is not mediated via the alpha1beta1 isoform or the specific glycoside binding to alpha1beta1 is needed for positive inotropy.",M1
19293189,"Inhibition of the sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump sensitizes cancer cells to anoikis and prevents distant tumor formation.Normal epithelial cells undergo apoptosis upon detachment from the extracellular matrix, a process termed  anoikis.  However, malignant epithelial cells with metastatic potential resist anoikis and can survive in an anchorage-independent fashion. Molecules that sensitize resistant cells to anoikis will be useful chemical probes to understand this pathway. To identify novel anoikis sensitizers in anoikis-resistant PPC-1 prostate adenocarcinoma cells, a library of 2,000 off-patent drugs and natural products was screened for their ability to preferentially induce cell death in suspension over adherent culture conditions. This screen identified five members of the family of cardiac <e>glycosides</e> as anoikis sensitizers, including ouabain, peruvoside, digoxin, digitoxin, and strophanthidin. We conducted further studies with ouabain to discern the mechanism of cardiac glycoside-induced anoikis sensitization. Ouabain initiated anoikis through the mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation. In addition, ouabain sensitized cells to anoikis by inhibiting its known target, the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase pump, and inducing hypoosmotic stress. Resistance to anoikis permits cancer cells to survive in the circulation and facilitates their metastasis to distant organs, so we tested the effects of Na(+)/K(+) ATPase inhibition on distant tumor formation in mouse models. In these mouse models, ouabain inhibited tumor metastases but did not alter the growth of subcutaneous tumors. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism to sensitize resistant cells to anoikis and decrease tumor metastasis. These results suggest a potential mechanism for the observed clinical reduction in metastasis and relapse in breast cancer patients who have undergone treatments with cardiac glycosides.",M1
19196986,"The cardiac <e>glycoside</e> binding site on the Na,K-ATPase alpha2 isoform plays a role in the dynamic regulation of active transport in skeletal muscle.The physiological significance of the cardiac glycoside-binding site on the Na,K-ATPase remains incompletely understood. This study used a gene-targeted mouse (alpha2(R/R)) which expresses a ouabain-insensitive alpha2 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase to investigate whether the cardiac glycoside-binding site plays any physiological role in active Na(+)/K(+) transport in skeletal muscles or in exercise performance. Skeletal muscles express the Na,K-ATPase alpha2 isoform at high abundance and regulate its transport over a wide dynamic range under control of muscle activity. Na,K-ATPase active transport in the isolated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of alpha2(R/R) mice was lower at rest and significantly enhanced after muscle contraction, compared with WT. During the first 60 s after a 30-s contraction, the EDL of alpha2(R/R) mice transported 70.0 nmol/g.min more (86)Rb than WT. Acute sequestration of endogenous ligand(s) in WT mice infused with Digibind to sequester endogenous cardiac glycoside(s) produced similar effects on both resting and contraction-induced (86)Rb transport. Additionally, the alpha2(R/R) mice exhibit an enhanced ability to perform physical exercise, showing a 2.1- to 2.8-fold lower failure rate than WT within minutes of the onset of moderate-intensity treadmill running. Their enhanced exercise performance is consistent with their enhanced contraction-induced Na,K-ATPase transport in the skeletal muscles. These results demonstrate that the Na,K-ATPase alpha2 isozyme in skeletal muscle is regulated dynamically by a mechanism that utilizes the cardiac glycoside-binding site and an endogenous ligand(s) and that its cardiac glycoside-binding site can play a physiological role in the dynamic adaptations to exercise.",M1
19066128,"Determinants of human and mouse melanoma cell sensitivities to oleandrin.Oleandrin, a cardiac <e>glycoside</e> component of Nerium oleander, has been shown to induce apoptosis in malignant cells. While human tumor cells are very sensitive to growth inhibition by oleandrin, murine tumor cells are extremely resistant. Using human BRO and mouse B16 melanoma cell lines, we explored several possible determinants of cell sensitivity to oleandrin and compared with ouabain. The studies include Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity and its isoforms as well as the cellular uptake of these cardiac glycosides. Oleandrin and ouabain induced apoptosis was detected in BRO cells while no evidence of cell death was observed in B16 cells even at concentrations 1000-fold higher than that used for BRO cells. Cellular uptake of oleandrin and ouabain was 3-4 fold greater in human BRO tumor cells than murine tumor cells. Partially purified Na+, K(+)-ATPase from human BRO cells was inhibited at a concentration that was 1000-fold less than that was required to inhibit mouse B16 enzyme to the same extent. Using Western blot analyses, human BRO cells were found to express both the sensitive alpha3 isoform and the less sensitive alpha1 isoform of Na+, K(+)-ATPase while mouse B16 cells expressed only the alpha1 isoform. These data suggest that differential expressions of Na+, K(+)-ATPase activities and its isoforms in BRO and B16 cells as well as cellular drug uptake may be important determinants of tumor cell sensitivity to cardiac glycosides.",M1
18948999,"Novel therapeutic applications of cardiac <e>glycosides</e>.Cardiac glycosides are a diverse family of naturally derived compounds that bind to and inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase. Members of this family have been in clinical use for many years for the treatment of heart failure and atrial arrhythmia, and the mechanism of their positive inotropic effect is well characterized. Exciting recent findings have suggested additional signalling modes of action of Na+/K+-ATPase, implicating cardiac glycosides in the regulation of several important cellular processes and highlighting potential new therapeutic roles for these compounds in various diseases. Perhaps most notably, the increased susceptibility of cancer cells to these compounds supports their potential use as cancer therapies, and the first generation of glycoside-based anticancer drugs are currently in clinical trials.",M1
18823299,"Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in healthy subjects receiving etoricoxib.AIMS: Digoxin is a commonly prescribed cardiac <e>glycoside</e> with a narrow therapeutic index. The aim was to investigate whether the cyclooxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug etoricoxib affects the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin. METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over study. In each period, 14 healthy volunteers ranging in age from 21 to 35 years received oral digoxin 0.25 mg daily and were randomized to either etoricoxib 120 mg or matching placebo tablets once daily for 10 days. Trough digoxin plasma concentrations were analysed by linear regression to examine digoxin accumulation over time. RESULTS: The geometric mean ratios (etoricoxib/placebo) for AUC(0-24h), C(max) and urinary excretion were 1.06 (90% confidence interval 0.97, 1.17), 1.33 (1.21, 1.46) and 1.10 (1.00, 1.20), respectively. The median (range) for digoxin T(max) (h) values with etoricoxib and placebo were 0.5 (0.5, 1.5) and 1.0 (0.5, 1.5), respectively. Steady-state digoxin plasma concentrations were achieved by day 7 in each treatment period. No serious adverse experiences were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although etoricoxib 120 mg did produce an approximately 33% increase in digoxin C(max), this increase does not appear to be clinically meaningful, as cardiotoxicity with digoxin has been associated with elevations in steady-state rather than peak concentrations. From these results, it appears that etoricoxib does not cause any changes in digoxin steady-state pharmacokinetics that would necessitate a dose adjustment.",M1
18794087,"High-throughput screening identifies cardiac <e>glycosides</e> as potent inhibitors of human tissue kallikrein expression: implications for cancer therapies.PURPOSE: Human tissue kallikreins (KLK) comprise a subgroup of 15 homologous secreted serine proteases. Primarily known for their clinical use as cancer biomarkers (e.g., PSA), KLKs have recently been directly implicated in cancer-related processes, including invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor growth regulation. Therefore, the identification of compounds that would modulate expression of KLKs might be of considerable therapeutic value. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) of three small molecule libraries ( approximately 4,500 compounds) was undertaken; KLK expression in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 was assessed with sensitive ELISAs. RESULTS: The initial screening resulted in 66  putative hits  that decreased KLK5 expression by at least 50% over control. Secondary screening and mini-dose-response assays resulted in 21  validated hits.  These 21 compounds were clustered in only three distinct functional families and were further analyzed in vitro to determine their effectiveness (IC(50)s). Hits that failed to show dose-responsiveness or interfered with the viability of the cells were excluded. Multiple members of the cardiac glycoside family were found to be novel inhibitors of KLK expression, acting at low concentrations (10-50 nmol/L). Furthermore, members of the same family induced marked decreases in c-MYC and c-FOS expression, in a dose-dependent manner that correlated the KLK inhibition, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism of regulation of KLK expression. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that cardiac glycosides can dramatically suppress the transcription of KLKs and that these effects may be linked to proto-oncogene (c-myc/fos) expression. These findings may partially explain the recently realized antineoplastic actions of cardiac glycosides.",M1
18453240,"A potential krimpsiekte vaccine.Krimpsiekte, a chronic form of cardiac <e>glycoside</e> poisoning, is an important plant-induced intoxication of small stock in South Africa. It is caused by cumulative, neurotoxic bufadienolides, such as cotyledoside. A cotyledoside-bovine serum albumin conjugate was synthesized to immunize animals. The efficacy of the cotyledoside-conjugate in inducing an immunological response was ascertained in rabbits (n = 4) and sheep (n = 4) by determining cotyledoside antibody titres with an ELISA using cotyledoside-hen ovalbumin as antigen. The formation of anticotyledoside antibodies was induced in both rabbits and sheep following immunization with the cotyledoside-protein conjugate. Protection provided by the vaccine was demonstrated by challenging sheep (n = 4) with repeated, daily doses of cotyledoside (0.015 mg/kg) administered intravenously, commencing 45 days after the initial vaccination. One control animal died on Day 3 of the challenge period and the other was severely affected after administration of the third cotyledoside dose. The immunized ewes (n = 2) remained clinically unaffected and the challenge was suspended following six daily injections. Vaccination as a means of preventing krimpsiekte seems to be quite feasible and deserves further investigation.",M1

18048883,"Autophagic cell death of human pancreatic tumor cells mediated by oleandrin, a lipid-soluble cardiac <e>glycoside</e>.Lipid-soluble cardiac glycosides such as bufalin, oleandrin, and digitoxin have been suggested as potent agents that might be useful as anticancer agents. Past research with oleandrin, a principle cardiac glycoside in Nerium oleander L. (Apocynaceae), has been shown to induce cell death through induction of apoptosis. In PANC-1 cells, a human pancreatic cancer cell line, cell death occurs not through apoptosis but rather through autophagy. Oleandrin at low nanomolar concentrations potently inhibited cell proliferation associated with induction of a profound G(2)/M cell cycle arrest. Inhibition of cell cycle was not accompanied by any significant sub G1 accumulation of cells, suggesting a nonapoptotic mechanism. Oleandrin-treated cells exhibited time- and concentration-dependent staining with acridine orange, a lysosomal stain. Subcellular changes within PANC-1 cells included mitochondrial condensation and translocation to a perinuclear position accompanied by vacuoles. Use of a fluorescent oleandrin analog (BODIPY-oleandrin) revealed co-localization of the drug within cell mitochondria. Damaged mitochondria were found within autophagosome structures. Formation of autophagosomes was confirmed through electron microscopy and detection of green fluorescent protein-labeled light chain 3 association with autophagosome membranes. Also observed was a drug-mediated inhibition of pAkt formation and up-regulation of pERK. Transfection of Akt into PANC-1 cells or inhibition of pERK activation by MAPK inhibitor abrogated oleandrin-mediated inhibition of cell growth, suggesting that the reduction of pAkt and increased pERK are important to oleandrin's ability to inhibit tumor cell proliferation. The data provide insight into the mechanisms and role of a potent, lipid-soluble cardiac glycoside (oleandrin) in control of human pancreatic cancer proliferation.",M1
17618121,"Identification and characterization of novel sodium/potassium-ATPase inhibitors by virtual screening of a compound database.The medicinal value of cardiac <e>glycoside</e> inhibitors for the treatment of congestive heart failure symptoms stems from their ability to specifically inhibit the ion transport activity of the transmembrane enzyme sodium/potassium-ATPase (Na/K-ATPase) in myocardial cells. In this study, we used the inhibitory potencies of 39 cardiac glycoside analogues for the development of a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model for Na/K-ATPase inhibition. In conjunction with a substructure and similarity search, the QSAR model was used to select ten potential inhibitors from a commercial compound database. The inhibitory potencies of these compounds were measured and four were found to be more active than the commonly used inhibitor ouabain. The results of the bioassays were incorporated into a second QSAR model, whose physical interpretation suggested that the nature of substituents in positions 10, 12, and 17 at the cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene core of the inhibitors was critical for enzyme inhibition. All descriptors of the QSAR models were conformation-independent, making the search protocol a suitable tool for the rapid virtual screening of large compound databases for novel inhibitors.",M1
17535738,"Vascular endothelium as a target for endogenous ouabain: studies on the effect of ouabain on human endothelial cells.It has been suggested that an endogenous inhibitor of the sodium pump, identified as ouabain, contributes to the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of certain forms of hypertension.

We studied the effect of ouabain on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and found that nanomolar concentrations of the <e>glycoside</e> have an antiapoptotic activity that is dependent on the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI-3K) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). At the same concentrations we found that ouabain affects the endocytosis of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) through the activation of signaling proteins such as Src kinase.

17535736,"Metabolic and signaling events mediated by cardiotonic steroid ouabain in rat skeletal muscle.The cardiac <e>glycoside</e> ouabain initiates a cascade of signaling events through Na+,K+-ATPase, leading to an increase in cell growth and proliferation in different cell types. We explored the effects of ouabain on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle and clarified the mechanisms of ouabain signal transduction. In rat soleus muscle 200 microM ouabain decreased basal glucose uptake without effect on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Ouabain increased glycogen synthesis additively to insulin and this effect was abolished in the presence of a MEK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) or a c-Src inhibitor (PP2). Ouabain exposure reduced glucose oxidation, and this effect was reversed in the presence of PP2. Incubation with ouabain did not affect intramuscular ATP and its metabolites; however acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation was reduced, with no effect on AMPK phosphorylation. Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was not affected by ouabain. Ouabain reduced basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PKC alpha/beta and delta isoforms, whereas phosphorylation of PKCzeta was unchanged. Ouabain exposure increased interaction of 1- and 2-subunits of Na-pump with c-Src, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation with c-Src. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, GSK 3 / and p90rsk activity was increased in response to ouabain, and these effects were prevented in the presence of PD98059 and PP2. In conclusion, the cardiac glycoside ouabain stimulates glycogen synthesis additively to insulin in rat skeletal muscle. This effect is mediated by activation of c-Src-, ERK1/2- p90rsk- and GSK3-dependent signaling pathway.",M1

The results also showed that H. crepitans oil contains 20.12% oleic acid, followed by stearic acid (3.0%), while linoleic acid is present at the lowest level (0.03%) among the other acids. The Hura oil has a high saponification value (127.16 +/- 0.18 mg/g) and low acid value (3.56 +/- 0.16 mg/g). The results also showed that the average molecular weight of glycerides is higher in the oil as reflected by the ester value (123.6 +/- 0.73 mg/g). The iodine value of Hura oil was found to be 65.62 +/- 0.73%. A low peroxide value (6.6 +/- 0.2 mg/g) was observed in Hura oil. The results showed that H. crepitans seed contains 328.1 IU of vitamin A/100 g, 0.398 mg of vitamin E/100 g, and 0.26 mg of vitamin K/100 g. The results also showed that H. crepitans seed is very rich in glutamate (14.41 g/100 g of protein) and deficient in cysteine (0.78 g/100 g of protein). Among the essential amino acids, arginine has the highest value (5.97 g/100 g of protein). This is followed by leucine, at 4.16 g/100 g of protein. Therefore, H. crepitans seed is a nutritionally promising seed.",M1
17349614,"Role of homologous ASP334 and GLU319 in human non-gastric H,K- and Na,K-ATPases in cardiac <e>glycoside</e> binding.Cardiac steroids inhibit Na,K-ATPase and the related non-gastric H,K-ATPase, while they do not interact with gastric H,K-ATPase. Introducing an arginine, the residue present in the gastric H,K-ATPase, in the second extracellular loop at the corresponding position 334 in the human non-gastric H,K-ATPase (D334R mutation) rendered it completely resistant to 2mM ouabain. The corresponding mutation (E319R) in alpha1 Na,K-ATPase produced a approximately 2-fold increase of the ouabain IC(50) in the ouabain-resistant rat alpha1 Na,K-ATPase and a large decrease of the ouabain affinity of human alpha1 Na,K-ATPase, on the other hand this mutation had no effect on the affinity for the aglycone ouabagenin. These results provide a strong support for the orientation of ouabain in its biding site with its sugar moiety interacting directly with the second extracellular loop.",M1
17137529,"Unexpectedly dangerous escargot stew: oleandrin poisoning through the alimentary chain.A female, aged 43 and a male, aged 66, experienced gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms after a meal including snail stew. Twelve hours after the ingestion, they presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cardiovascular symptoms typical of acute toxic digoxin ingestion and were hospitalized. The man's electrocardiogram was altered, and the woman's was normal. Serum digoxin levels, measured on a Roche COBAS Integra 800 with the Roche On-Line Digoxin reagent, were 1.14 and 1.00 nmol/L, respectively. Potassium levels were normal in both patients. The serum digoxin concentration decreased on the second day, and symptoms resolved on the third day with patients fully recovered (i.e., reversion to a normal sinus rhythm). Cardiac-<e>glycoside</e>-like intoxication symptoms follow the ingestion of leaves or flowers of Nerium oleander. The consumed snails were suspected to be responsible for the intoxication. In the homogenized snail tissue, the concentration expressed in digoxin equivalents was 0.282 nmol/g. The presence of oleandrin and oleandrigenin in the snails was confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, which was performed on a ionic-trap Finnigan LXQ instrument using an electrospray ionization interface. High-pressure liquid chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 column with a gradient of methanol/water. An extract of oleander leaves was used as reference.",M1
17054261,"Antidotes for acute cardenolide (cardiac <e>glycoside</e>) poisoning.BACKGROUND: Cardenolides are naturally occurring plant toxins which act primarily on the heart. While poisoning with the digitalis cardenolides (digoxin and digitoxin) are reported worldwide, cardiotoxicity from other cardenolides such as the yellow oleander are also a major problem, with tens of thousands of cases of poisoning each year in South Asia. Because cardenolides from these plants are structurally similar, acute poisonings are managed using similar treatments. The benefit of these treatments is of interest, particularly in the context of cost since most poisonings occur in developing countries where resources are very limited. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of antidotes for the treatment of acute cardenolide poisoning, in particular atropine, isoprenaline (isoproterenol), multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC), fructose-1,6-diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, phenytoin and anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Controlled Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration, Current Awareness in Clinical Toxicology, Info Trac, www.google.com.au, and Science Citation Index of studies identified by the previous searches. We manually searched the bibliographies of identified articles and personally contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials where antidotes were administered to patients with acute symptomatic cardenolide poisoning were identified. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently extracted data on study design, including the method of randomisation, participant characteristics, type of intervention and outcomes from each study. We independently assessed methodological quality of the included studies. A pooled analysis was not appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Two randomised controlled trials were identified, both were conducted in patients with yellow oleander poisoning. One trial investigated the effect of MDAC on mortality, the relative risk (RR) was 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83) indicating a beneficial effect. The second study found a beneficial effect of anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin on the presence of cardiac dysrhythmias at two hours post-administration; the RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.81). Other benefits were also noted in both studies and serious adverse effects were minimal. Studies assessing the effect of antidotes on other cardenolides were not identified. One ongoing study investigating the activated charcoal for acute yellow oleander self-poisoning was also identified. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence to suggest that MDAC and anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin may be effective treatments for yellow oleander poisoning. However, the efficacy and indications of these interventions for the treatment of acute digitalis poisoning is uncertain due to the lack of good quality controlled clinical trials. Given pharmacokinetic differences between individual cardenolides, the effect of antidotes administered to patients with yellow oleander poisoning cannot be readily translated to those of other cardenolides. Unfortunately cost limits the use of antidotes such as anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin in developing countries where cardenolide poisonings are frequent. More research is required using relatively cheap antidotes which may also be effective.",M1
16960423,"Topics on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger: role of vascular NCX1 in salt-dependent hypertension.Excess salt intake is a major risk factor for hypertension. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying salt-dependent hypertension remain obscure. Our recent studies using selective Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibitors and genetically engineered mice provide compelling evidence that salt-dependent hypertension is triggered by Ca(2+) entry through Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger type 1 (NCX1) in arterial smooth muscle. Endogenous cardiac <e>glycosides</e>, which may contribute to salt-dependent hypertension, seem to be necessary for NCX1-mediated hypertension. Intriguingly, recent studies by Dostanic-Larson et al. using knock-in mice with modified cardiac glycoside binding affinity of Na(+),K(+)-ATPases demonstrate that this binding site plays an important physiological role in blood pressure control. Thus, when cardiac glycosides inhibit Na(+),K(+)-ATPase in arterial smooth muscle cells, the elevation of local Na(+) on the submembrane area is believed to facilitate Ca(2+) entry through NCX1, resulting in vasoconstriction. This proposed pathway may have enabled us to explain how to link dietary salt to hypertension.",M1
16825310,"The inotropic effect of cardioactive <e>glycosides</e> in ventricular myocytes requires Na+-Ca2+ exchanger function.Glycoside-induced cardiac inotropy has traditionally been attributed to direct Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase inhibition, causing increased intracellular [Na(+)] and consequent Ca(2+) gain via the Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX). However, recent studies suggested alternative mechanisms of glycoside-induced inotropy: (1) direct activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release channels (ryanodine receptors; RyRs); (2) increased Ca(2+) selectivity of Na(+) channels (slip-mode conductance); and (3) other signal transduction pathways. None of these proposed mechanisms requires NCX or an altered [Na(+)] gradient. Here we tested the ability of ouabain (OUA, 3 microm), digoxin (DIG, 20 microm) or acetylstrophanthidin (ACS, 4 microm) to alter Ca(2+) transients in completely Na(+)-free conditions in intact ferret and cat ventricular myocytes. We also tested whether OUA directly activates RyRs in permeabilized cat myocytes (measuring Ca(2+) sparks by confocal microscopy). In intact ferret myocytes (stimulated at 0.2 Hz), DIG and ACS enhanced Ca(2+) transients and cell shortening during twitches, as expected. However, prior depletion of [Na(+)](i) (in Na(+)-free, Ca(2+)-free solution) and in Na(+)-free solution (replaced by Li(+)) the inotropic effects of DIG and ACS were completely prevented. In voltage-clamped cat myocytes, OUA increased Ca(2+) transients by 48 +/- 4% but OUA had no effect in Na(+)-depleted cells (replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine). In permeabilized cat myocytes, OUA did not change Ca(2+) spark frequency, amplitude or spatial spread (although spark duration was slightly prolonged). We conclude that the acute inotropic effects of DIG, ACS and OUA (and the effects on RyRs) depend on the presence of Na(+) and a functional NCX in ferret and cat myocytes (rather than alternate Na(+)-independent mechanisms).",M1
16793926,"Cardiac <e>glycosides</e> provide neuroprotection against ischemic stroke: discovery by a brain slice-based compound screening platform.We report here the results of a chemical genetic screen using small molecules with known pharmacologies coupled with a cortical brain slice-based model for ischemic stroke. We identified a small-molecule compound not previously appreciated to have neuroprotective action in ischemic stroke, the cardiac glycoside neriifolin, and demonstrated that its properties in the brain slice assay included delayed therapeutic potential exceeding 6 h. Neriifolin is structurally related to the digitalis class of cardiac glycosides, and its putative target is the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Other cardiac glycoside compounds tested also showed neuroprotective activity, although with lower apparent potencies. In subsequent whole-animal studies, we found that neriifolin provided significant neuroprotection in a neonatal model of hypoxia/ischemia and in a middle cerebral artery occlusion model of transient focal ischemia. The neuroprotective potential of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase is of particular interest because of its known  druggability ; indeed, Food and Drug Administration-approved, small-molecule compounds such as digitoxin and digoxin have been in clinical usage for congestive heart failure and arrhythmias for several decades. Thus, an existing cardiac glycoside or closely related compound could provide an accelerated path toward clinical trial testing for ischemic stroke. Our findings underscore the important role that hypothesis-neutral, high-content, tissue-based screens can play in the identification of new candidate drugs and drug targets for the treatment of diseases for which validated therapeutic pathways are not currently available.",M1
16704760,"Effect of plantain on therapeutic drug monitoring of digoxin and thirteen other common drugs.INTRODUCTION: Plantain, a herbal remedy, has been reported to interfere with therapeutic drug monitoring of digoxin. We evaluated three commercially available plantain products for potential interference with therapeutic drug monitoring of digoxin and 13 other common drugs. METHOD: Dry content of plantain capsule or plantain leaf was extracted with either methanol or ethanol:water (60:40 by volume), added to drug-free serum and apparent digoxin was measured by both fluorescence polarization immunoassay and microparticle enzyme immunoassay. Using immunoassays, we also measured apparent concentrations of 13 other drugs (tobramycin, procainamide, tricyclic antidepressants, quinidine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, theophylline, valproic acid, amikacin, gentamycin, phenobarbital, salicylate and acetaminophen [paracetamol]) due to the presence of plantain. In separate experiments, a serum pool prepared from patients receiving digoxin was further supplemented with plantain and observed digoxin values were compared with original digoxin concentration. The presence of any cardiac <e>glycoside</e> in plantain was also investigated using thin layer chromatography (TLC). RESULTS: We observed no apparent digoxin in the presence of plantain in serum. Moreover, when aliquots of digoxin serum pool were supplemented with various amounts of plantain, the observed digoxin concentrations in the presence of plantain compared well with original digoxin concentration. TLC analysis did not show the presence of either digoxin or digitoxin in plantain products studied. Moreover, plantain did not affect immunoassay results of the 13 other drugs studied. CONCLUSIONS: The plantain products studied did not interfere with therapeutic drug monitoring of digoxin as well as 13 other commonly monitored drugs.",M1
16641927,"Hypertension, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and Na+, K+-ATPase.Hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, or end-stage renal failure. The critical importance of excess salt intake in the pathogenesis of hypertension is widely recognized, but the mechanisms whereby salt intake elevates blood pressure have puzzled researchers. Recent studies using Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitors and genetically engineered mice provide evidence that vascular Na+/Ca2+ exchanger type 1 (NCX1) is involved in the development of salt-dependent hypertension. Endogenous cardiac <e>glycosides</e>, which may contribute to salt-dependent hypertension, seem to be necessary for NCX1-mediated hypertension. Intriguingly, studies using knock-in mice with modified cardiac glycoside binding affinity of Na+,K+-ATPases provide a clear demonstration that this cardiac glycoside-binding site plays an important role in blood pressure regulation. Taken all together: (1) endogenous cardiac glycosides are secreted after high salt intake; (2) these cardiac glycosides inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase in vascular smooth muscle cells; (3) this inhibition results in the elevation of local Na+ on the submembrane area; and (4) this elevation of local Na+ facilitates Ca2+ entry through NCX1, resulting in vasoconstriction. This proposed pathway may have enabled us to explain how to link dietary salt to hypertension.",M1
16467499,"Physiological role of the alpha1- and alpha2-isoforms of the Na+-K+-ATPase and biological significance of their cardiac <e>glycoside</e> binding site.An interesting feature of Na+-K+-ATPase is that it contains four isoforms of the catalytic alpha-subunit, each with a tissue-specific distribution. Our laboratory has used gene targeting to define the functional role of the alpha1- and alpha2-isoforms. While knockout mice demonstrated the importance of the alpha1- and alpha2-isoforms for survival, the knockin mice, in which each isoform can be individually inhibited by ouabain and its function determined, demonstrated that both isoforms are regulators of cardiac muscle contractility. Another intriguing aspect of the Na+-K+-ATPase is that it contains a binding site for cardiac glycosides, such as digoxin. Conservation of this site suggests that it may have an in vivo role and that a natural ligand must exist to interact with this site. In fact, cardiac glycoside-like compounds have been observed in mammals. Our recent study demonstrates that the cardiac glycoside binding site of the Na+-K+-ATPase plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure and that it mediates both ouabain-induced and ACTH-induced hypertension in mice. Whereas chronic administration of ouabain or ACTH caused hypertension in wild-type mice, it had no effect on blood pressure in mice with a ouabain-resistant alpha2-isoform of Na+-K+-ATPase. Interestingly, animals with the ouabain-sensitive alpha1-isoform and a ouabain-resistant alpha2-isoform develop ACTH-induced hypertension to a greater extent than wild-type animals. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the cardiac glycoside binding of the Na+-K+-ATPase has a physiological role and suggests a function for a naturally occurring ligand that is stimulated by administration of ACTH.",M1
16331685,"Cardiac <e>glycoside</e> inhibits IL-8-induced biological responses by downregulating IL-8 receptors through altering membrane fluidity.Considering the potential role of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in inflammation, angiogenesis, tumorogenesis, and metastasis, and the involvement of different cell types especially neutrophils and macrophages in those processes, the regulation of IL-8-mediated biological responses is important. In this report we provide evidences that oleandrin, a cardiac glycoside potentially inhibited IL-8-, formyl peptide (FMLP)-, EGF-, or nerve growth factor (NGF)-, but not IL-1- or TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation in macrophages. Oleandrin inhibited IL-8-, but not TNF-induced NF-kappaB-dependent genes expression. Oleandrin inhibited the binding of IL-8, EGF, or NGF, but not IL-1 or TNF. It decreased almost 79% IL-8 binding without altering affinity towards IL-8 receptors and this inhibition of IL-8 binding was observed in isolated membrane. The IL-8, anti-IL-8Rs antibodies, or protease inhibitors were unable to protect oleandrin-mediated inhibition of IL-8 binding. Phospholipids significantly protected oleandrin-mediated inhibition of IL-8 binding thereby restoring IL-8-induced NF-kappaB activation. Oleandrin altered the membrane fluidity as detected by microviscosity parameter and a decrease in diphenylhexatriene, a lipid binding fluorophore binding in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, our results suggest that oleandrin inhibits IL-8-mediated biological responses in diverse cell types by modulating IL-8Rs through altering membrane fluidity and microviscosity. The study might help to regulate IL-8-mediated biological responses involved in inflammation, metastasis, and neovascularization.",M1
16309889,"The neurotoxic effects of prenatal cardiac <e>glycoside</e> exposure: a hypothesis.Cardiac glycosides (CGs) are beneficial in treating cardiac conditions; depending on time and dosage, they can also be toxic as they regularly cross the blood brain barrier and the placenta and may affect the unborn baby. This paper therefore focuses on the effects of CGs administered to the mother on normal cellular physiology of the foetus with specific reference to neural tissue. CGs act by binding to the Na+/K+-ATPase and decrease or inhibit Na+-K+ pump activity. In the foetus, CGs may disrupt ion homeostasis. An over-dosage of CGs or when it is taken during pregnancy, can also affect the neuro-energy levels of brain tissue in particular. We conclude and hypothesize that CGs in this case will not only cause severe alterations in neuronal function due to disruption of membrane activity, but also in glutamate clearance, affecting neurotransmission in general. Furthermore, elevated cytosolic Ca2+ will lead to permeabilization of the mitochondrial membranes, resulting ultimately in mitochondrial dysfunction. This will result in neurotoxicity--ensuing in neural cell damage or death, and we propose the mechanism to be due to neuro-necrapoptosis.",M1
16300187,"The role of fluorescence polarization immuno-assay in the diagnosis of plant-induced cardiac <e>glycoside</e> poisoning livestock in South Africa.Poisoning with cardiac glycoside-containing plants is collectively the most important plant-associated poisoning of livestock in southern Africa. As a diagnosis of this significant poisoning is currently based on circumstantial evidence, a practical chemical procedure indicating the presence of cardiac glycosides in plants and animal specimens would be of considerable benefit. The fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) method, used to determine digoxin plasma levels in humans and dogs, was adapted to estimate cardiac glycoside levels in known cardiac-glycoside-containing plants as well as in the rumen and organs of dosed sheep. Positive FPIA values were obtained with bufadienolide-containing plants, while negative results were obtained with plants not known to contain cardiac glycosides. The FPIA has aided in the diagnosis of cardiac glycoside poisoning in livestock and game in 30 outbreaks examined at the Division of Toxicology, Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute. Each outbreak is briefly described. As a result of this assay, a better understanding of cardiac glycoside poisoning has been reached.",M1

16243970,"The highly conserved cardiac <e>glycoside</e> binding site of Na,K-ATPase plays a role in blood pressure regulation.The Na,K-ATPase contains a binding site for cardiac glycosides, such as ouabain, digoxin, and digitoxin, which is highly conserved among species ranging from Drosophila to humans. Although advantage has been taken of this site to treat congestive heart failure with drugs such as digoxin, it is unknown whether this site has a natural function in vivo. Here we show that this site plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure, and it specifically mediates adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced hypertension in mice. We used genetically engineered mice in which the Na,K-ATPase alpha2 isoform, which is normally sensitive to cardiac glycosides, was made resistant to these compounds. Chronic administration of ACTH caused hypertension in WT mice but not in mice with an ouabain-resistant alpha2 isoform of Na,K-ATPase. This finding demonstrates that the cardiac glycoside binding site of the Na,K-ATPase plays an important role in blood pressure regulation, most likely by responding to a naturally occurring ligand. Because the alpha1 isoform is sensitive to cardiac glycosides in humans, we developed mice in which the naturally occurring ouabain-resistant alpha1 isoform was made ouabain-sensitive. Mice with the ouabain-sensitive  human-like  alpha1 isoform and an ouabain-resistant alpha2 isoform developed ACTH-induced hypertension to greater extent than WT animals. This result indicates that the cardiac glycoside binding site of the alpha1 isoform can also mediate ACTH-induced hypertension. Taken together these results demonstrate that the cardiac glycoside binding site of the alpha isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase have a physiological function and supports the hypothesis for a role of the endogenous cardiac glycosides.",M1

15971203,"Molecular modeling of cardiac <e>glycoside</e> binding by the human sequence monoclonal antibody 1B3.The amino acid sequences of the heavy- and light-chain variable regions of the high-affinity human sequence antidigoxin monoclonal antibody 1B3 (mAb 1B3) were determined, and a structural model for the mAb's variable region was developed by homology modeling techniques. The structural model provided the basis for computationally docking digoxin and eight related cardiac glycosides into the putative binding site of mAb 1B3. Analysis of the consensus binding mode obtained for digoxin showed that the cardenolide moiety of digoxin is deeply embedded in a predominantly hydrophobic, narrow cavity, whereas the terminal, gamma-carbohydrate group is solvent-exposed. The docking results indicated that the primary driving forces for digoxin binding by mAb 1B3 are hydrophobic interactions with the digoxin steroid ring system and hydrogen bonds with the digitoxose groups. The binding model accounts for the experimentally observed variations in mAb 1B3 binding affinity for various structural analogs of digoxin used previously to develop a 3D structure-activity relationship model of drug binding (Farr CD, Tabet MR, Ball WJ Jr, Fishwild DM, Wang X, Nair AC, Welsh WJ. Three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis of ligand binding to human sequence antidigoxin monoclonal antibodies using comparative molecular field analysis. J Med Chem 2002;45:3257-3270). In particular, the hydrogen bond pattern is consistent with the unique sensitivity of mAb 1B3's binding affinity to the number of sugar residues present in a cardiac glycoside. The hydrophobic environment about the steroid moiety of digoxin is compatible with the mAb's reduced affinity for ligands that possess hydrophilic hydroxyl and acetyl group modifications in this region. The model also indicated that most of the amino acid residues in contact with the ligand reside in or about the three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the heavy chain and the third CDR of the light chain. A comparison of the 1B3 binding model with the crystal structures of two murine antidigoxin mAbs revealed similar binding patterns used by the three mAbs, such as a high frequency of occurrence of aromatic, hydrophobic residues in the CDRs and a dominant role of the heavy chain CDR3 in antigen binding.",M1

12027881,"Endogenous cardiac <e>glycosides</e>, a new class of steroid hormones.The search for endogenous digitalis has led to the isolation of ouabain as well as several additional cardiotonic steroids of the cardenolide and bufadienolide type from blood, adrenals, and hypothalamus. The concentration of endogenous ouabain is elevated in blood upon increased Na(+) uptake, hypoxia, and physical exercise. Changes in blood levels of ouabain upon physical exercise occur rapidly. Adrenal cortical cells in tissue culture release ouabain upon addition of angiotensin II and epinephrine, and it is thought that ouabain is released from adrenal cortex in vivo. Ouabain levels in blood are elevated in 50% of Caucasians with low-renin hypertension. Infusion over several weeks of low concentrations of ouabain, but not of digoxin, induces hypertension in rats. A digoxin-like compound, which has been isolated from human urine and adrenals, as well various other endogenous cardiac glycosides may counterbalance their actions within a regulatory framework of water and salt metabolism. Marinobufagenin, for instance, whose concentration is increased after cardiac infarction, may show natriuretic properties because it inhibits the alpha1 isoform of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, the main sodium pump isoform of the kidney, much better than other sodium pump isoforms. In analogy to other steroid hormones, cardiotonic steroid hormones in blood are bound to a specific cardiac glycoside binding globulin. The discovery of ouabain as a new adrenal hormone affecting Na(+) metabolism and the development of the new ouabain antagonist PST 2238 allows for new possibilities for the therapy of hypertension and congestive heart failure. This will lead in turn to a better understanding of the disease on a physiological and endocrinological level and of the action of ouabain on the cellular level as a signal that is transduced to the plasma membrane as well as to the cell nucleus.",M1

These early reports were based on indirect measurements in multicellular preparations, hence, there was some uncertainty whether ion accumulation/depletion rather than pump stimulation caused the observations. Here, we utilize the whole-cell patch-clamp technique on isolated cardiac myocytes to directly measure Na/K pump current (I(P)) in conditions that minimize the possibility of ion accumulation/depletion causing the observed effects. In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, nanomolar concentrations of dihydro-ouabain (DHO) caused an outward current that appeared to be due to stimulation of I(P) because of the following: (1) it was absent in 0 mM [K(+)](o), as was I(P); (2) it was absent in 0 mM [Na(+)](i), as was I(P); (3) at reduced [Na(+)](i), the outward current was reduced in proportion to the reduction in I(P); (4) it was eliminated by intracellular vanadate, as was I(P). Our previous work suggested guinea pig ventricular myocytes coexpress the alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-isoforms of the Na/K pumps. The stimulation of I(P) appears to be through stimulation of the high glycoside affinity alpha(2)-isoform and not the alpha(1)-isoform because of the following: (1) regulatory signals that specifically increased activity of the alpha(2)-isoform increased the amplitude of the stimulation; (2) regulatory signals that specifically altered the activity of the alpha(1)-isoform did not affect the stimulation; (3) changes in [K(+)](o) that affected activity of the alpha(1)-isoform, but not the alpha(2)-isoform, did not affect the stimulation; (4) myocytes from one group of guinea pigs expressed the alpha(1)-isoform but not the alpha(2)-isoform, and these myocytes did not show the stimulation. At 10 nM DHO, total I(P) increased by 35 +/- 10% (mean +/- SD, n = 18). If one accepts the hypothesis that this increase is due to stimulation of just the alpha(2)-isoform, then activity of the alpha(2)-isoform increased by 107 +/- 30%. In the guinea pig myocytes, nanomolar ouabain as well as DHO stimulated the alpha(2)-isoform, but both the stimulatory and inhibitory concentrations of ouabain were approximately 10-fold lower than those for DHO. Stimulation of I(P) by nanomolar DHO was observed in canine atrial and ventricular myocytes, which express the alpha(1)- and alpha(3)-isoforms of the Na/K pumps, suggesting the other high glycoside affinity isoform (the alpha(3)-isoform) also was stimulated by nanomolar concentrations of DHO. Human atrial and ventricular myocytes express all three isoforms, but isoform affinity for glycosides is too similar to separate their activity. Nevertheless, nanomolar DHO caused a stimulation of I(P) that was very similar to that seen in other species. Thus, in all species studied, nanomolar DHO caused stimulation of I(P), and where the contributions of the high glycoside affinity alpha(2)- and alpha(3)-isoforms could be separated from that of the alpha(1)-isoform, it was only the high glycoside affinity isoform that was stimulated. These observations support early reports that nanomolar concentrations of glycosides stimulate Na/K pump activity, and suggest a novel mechanism of isoform-specific regulation of I(P) in heart by nanomolar concentrations of endogenous ouabain-like molecules.",M1
11926013,"Cardiovascular <e>glycoside</e>-like intoxication following ingestion of Thevetia nereifolia/peruviana seeds: a case report.Some plants contain glycoside compounds which determine cardiovascular symptoms similar to those observed after acute toxic digoxin administration. The present case report involves a patient who showed important cardiovascular symptoms following the ingestion of Thevetia nereifolia/peruviana seeds. About 30 min after ingestion, a 65-year-old man presented with dizziness, giddiness, numbness and a burning sensation, diarrhea, sweating, vomiting and ECG changes. At the time of admission he presented with tremors; his body temperature was 37 degrees C, and blood analysis gave the following results: K 5.6 mEq/l, myoglobin 176 IU, troponin T 0.10 ng/ml, PO2 69 mmHg, PCO2 37.4 mmHg, pH 7.33, HCO3- 19.9 mEq/l, hemoglobin 14.8 g/dl, saturation 92.5%. Echocardiography showed a left ventricle with normal global and segmentary contractility. The following days, the patient showed a reduction, until total resolution, of the atrioventricular block and of the alterations of the ST segment. The ectopic beats also resolved; K value before discharge was 4.4 mEq/l. On the third day, the serum levels of digoxin were 0.15 ng/ml. This case report is important because it describes all the cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular signs of glycoside toxicity in an adult patient who accidentally swallowed only two seeds (non-fatal dose) of Thevetia.",M1
11861419,"The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is essential for the action of cardiac <e>glycosides</e>.The widely accepted model to explain the positive inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides invokes altered Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity secondary to Na+ pump inhibition. However, proof of this model is lacking and alternative mechanisms have been proposed. We directly tested the role of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in the action of the glycoside ouabain using Na+-Ca2+ exchanger knockout mice. Ablation of the exchanger is embryonic lethal, but contractility can be studied in embryonic heart tubes at day 9.5 postcoitum. Heart tubes isolated from homozygous Na+-Ca2+ exchanger knockout mice (NCX-/-) display surprisingly normal Ca2+ transients. Removal of extracellular Na+ induces Ca2+ overload in wild-type heart tubes but does not alter the Ca2+ transients of NCX-/- heart tubes. Similarly, ouabain, at levels causing Ca2+ overload in wild-type heart tubes, has no effect on NCX-/- heart tubes. We conclude that in embryonic mouse myocytes the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is absolutely required for the effect of cardiac glycosides on Ca2+(i).",M1
11525232,"Local and systemic effects of Na+/K+ATPase inhibition.The positive inotropic and electrophysiological effects of cardiac <e>glycosides</e> on cardiac muscle are mediated through inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase by binding to a specific extracytoplasmic site of the a-subunit of this enzyme. The inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase affects ionic flux and produces direct local effects on cardiac contractility, electrical excitability and conduction, but also profound systemic effects mainly as a result of haemodynamic changes. These effects are responsible for beneficial therapeutic as well as toxic effects. Inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase results in potentiation of K+ loss from cells and Na+ entry into cells, so consequently affects action potential generation and propagation. This also underlines the potentiation of certain effects of cardiac glycosides by hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia, and the effects of changes in calcium homeostasis on the cardiac glycoside pharmacodynamics. Furthermore, inhibition of Na+/Ca++ exchange enhances Ca++ mobilization and promotes contractility. These effects (locally and systemically) differ greatly, depending on the haemodynamic status and myocardial oxygen supply. Cardiac glycosides have less affinity for Na+/K+ ATPases at other sites (e.g. skeletal muscle), but some extracardiac effects (vascular effects, effects on colour vision, CNS and autonomic effects, renal effects) may be related to Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition.",M1
11448457,"Inhibition of export of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) from the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 by Anvirzel and its cardiac <e>glycoside</e> component, oleandrin.Anvirzel is an extract of Nerium oleander currently undergoing Phase I clinical evaluation as a potential treatment for cancer. Two of the active components of Anvirzel are the cardiac glycosides oleandrin and oleandrigenin. Previous studies have demonstrated that, in vitro, cardiac glycosides may inhibit fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) export through membrane interaction with the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase pump. In continuing research on the antitumor activity of this novel plant extract, the relative abilities of oleandrin and oleandrigenin to inhibit FGF-2 export from two human prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3, were examined. An ELISA assay was utilized to determine the FGF-2 concentration in the cell culture medium before and after exposure to cardiac glycosides or the parent extract material Anvirzel. Both cell lines were exposed to non-cytotoxic concentrations of oleandrin (0.05 and 0.1 ng/mL) for up to 72 hr. Studies also were conducted with Anvirzel and ouabain. Oleandrin (0.1 ng/mL) produced a 45.7% inhibition of FGF-2 release from PC3 cells and a 49.9% inhibition from DU145 cells. Non-cytotoxic concentrations (100 ng/mL) of Anvirzel produced a 51.9 and 30.8% inhibition of FGF-2 release, respectively, in the two cell lines. The decrease in FGF-2 release from cells required continuous incubation for 48--72 hr; shorter incubation times were not effective. These results demonstrate that Anvirzel, like oleandrin, inhibited FGF-2 export in vitro from PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion and may, therefore, contribute to the antitumor activity of this novel treatment for cancer.",M1
11355001,"Endogenous cardiotonic steroids.The search for endogenous digitalis led to the isolation of ouabain from blood adrenals and hypothalamus. Additional cardiotonic steroids of the cardenolid and bufadienolide type seem to circulate in blood. Adrenal cortical cells in tissue culture release ouabain upon addition of angiotensin 11. Ouabain in blood is increased in 50% of Caucasians with low renin hypertension. Analogous to other steroid hormones, cardiotonic steroid hormones in blood are bound to a specific cardiac <e>glycoside</e> binding globulin. Since ouabain induced growth of myocytes in tissue culture, this effect probably mediates by partial inhibition of the sodium pump and consecutive rise of intracellular Ca2+ the thickening of the wall of arteries and myocardium. PST 2238, an antagonist of cardiac glycoside function at the sodium pump, leads in rats under prolonged therapy to a decrease of hypertension. The finding of ouabain as a new adrenal hormone of the Na+ metabolism and of ouabain antagonists opens new possibilities of therapy of hypertension and congestive heart failure.",M1
11306668,"Charge movements in intact amphibian skeletal muscle fibres in the presence of cardiac <e>glycosides</e>.1. Intramembrane charge movements were examined in intact voltage-clamped amphibian muscle fibres following treatment with cardiac glycosides in the hypertonic gluconate-containing solutions hitherto reported to emphasise the features of q(gamma) at the expense of q(beta) charge. 2. The application of chlormadinone acetate (CMA) at concentrations known selectively to block Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase conserved the steady-state voltage dependence of intramembrane charge, contributions from delayed (q(gamma)) charging transients, and their inactivation characteristics brought about by shifts in holding potential. 3. The addition of either ouabain (125, 250 or 500 nM) or digoxin (5 nM) at concentrations previously reported additionally to influence excitation-contraction coupling similarly conserved the steady-state charge-voltage relationships, Q(V), in fully polarised fibres to give values of maximum charge, Q(max), transition voltage, V*, and steepness factor, k, that were consistent with a persistent q component as reported on earlier occasions (Q(max) approximately = 25-27 nC F-1, V* approximately = -45 to -50 mV, k approximately = 7-9 mV). 4. In both cases shifts in holding potential from -90 to -50 mV produced a partial inactivation that separated steeply and more gradually voltage-dependent charge components in agreement with previous characterisations. 5. However, charge movements that were observed in the presence of either digoxin or ouabain were monotonic decays in which delayed (q(gamma)) transients could not be distinguished from the early charging records. These features persisted despite the further addition of chlormadinone acetate over a 10-fold concentration range (5-50 microM) known to displace ouabain from the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase. 6. Ouabain (500 nM) restored the steady-state charge movement that was previously abolished by the addition of 2.0 mM tetracaine in common with previous results of using ryanodine receptor (RyR)-specific agents. 7. Perchlorate (8.0 mM) restored the delayed 'on' relaxations and increased the prominence of the 'off' decays produced by q(gamma) charge following treatment with cardiac glycosides. This was accompanied by a negative (approximately 10-15 mV) shift in the steady-state charge-voltage relationship but an otherwise conserved maximum charge, Q(max), and steepness factor, k, in parallel with previously reported effects of perchlorate following treatments with RyR-specific agents. 8. The features of cardiac glycoside action thus parallel those of other agents that act on RyR-Ca(2+) release channels yet influence the kinetics but spare the steady-state properties of intramembrane charge.",M1
11230321,"Structure-activity relationships for the hypertensinogenic activity of ouabain: role of the sugar and lactone ring.Elevated levels of an endogenous ouabain circulate in many patients with essential hypertension. However, in contrast to ouabain, digoxin does not induce hypertension. This study investigated the hypothesis that within a single cardiac <e>glycoside</e>, the structural elements that induce hypertension differ from those responsible for high potency as a sodium pump inhibitor. Normal male Sprague-Dawley rats received infusions of vehicle (VEH), rhamnose (RHA), ouabain (OUA), ouabagenin (OGN), dihydro-ouabain (DHO), iso-ouabain (ISO), and a lactone ring opened analog (ORO) at 30 microgram. kg(-1). 24 h(-1) for 5 weeks via subcutaneous osmotic pumps. Cuff pressures were taken weekly. At the end of the study, trunk blood was harvested, extracted by C18 column, and subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography. Fractions were analyzed for OUA, OGN, and DHO by immunoassay. In OUA-, OGN-, and DHO-infused rats, 1 main peak of immunoreactivity corresponding to the infused agent was found. No evidence of in vivo conversion to OUA or DHO was found for any analog except ORO. At 5 weeks, systolic blood pressures in VEH, RHA, OUA, OGN, DHO, ISO, and ORO were 132+/-2.5, 133+/-1.5, 159+/-2.6,* 154+/-4,* 167+/-4,* 171+/-2.2,* and 169+/-2.4* mm Hg, respectively (*P&lt;0.01 versus VEH and RHA, P&lt;0.05 versus OUA). The hypertensinogenic activity was greater than OUA in 3 analogs (DHO, ISO, and ORO) in which the lactone was saturated, conformationally restrained by linkage with the oxygen at C14, or opened, respectively. These compounds were weak inhibitors of dog kidney Na,K-ATPase. Thus, RHA and the unsaturated lactone ring are crucial to the high potency of OUA as an inhibitor of the sodium pump but appear to be unrelated to its ability to induce hypertension. The conclusion that this form of hypertension is mediated primarily by the steroid nucleus suggests also that OUA may have a mechanism of action independent of the sodium pump.",M1
11126988,"[Unwanted drug interaction between anti-arrhythmic drugs and drugs used for heart failure]The appearance of adverse drug reactions may depend on the category of used drugs as well as on the coexistence of a pathological stage. Clinically important are: interactions of digitalis <e>glycoside</e> drugs leading to the occurrence or intensification of toxic symptoms characteristic for those drugs; interactions of antiarrhythmic drugs which may cause proarrhythmic effects and hypotension, and also interactions of nitrates resulting in lowering of the blood pressure. Quinidine, verapamil, nitrendipine, amiodaron, propafenone, captopril, spironolactone decrease renal clearance of digoxin, and amilorid/triamteren lower the extrarenal clearance of this drug. Thus the outcome of those concommitant therapies is the increase of digoxin serum concentration and appearance of toxic symptoms. Clinically dangerous, in the course of the antiarrhythmic therapy, is the increased risk of the arrhythmia appearance when two or more antiarrhythmic drugs are applied concomitantly. Antiarrhythmic drugs class IA (quinidine, disopyramide), class III (sotalol, amiodarone), class IV (calcium channel blockers) used at the same time with potassium depleters diuretics or beta-blocking agents result in the inhibition of repolarization and the increased duration of activation potential with the risk of developing arrhythmia of the torsade de pointes types. Nitrates interactions are mainly of the pharmacodynamic character. Most common adverse drug reaction, observed during the concomitant nitrates and another circulatory drug therapy, is excessive lowering of the blood pressure. These may lead to the decrease in the therapeutic efficacy of these combinations. Interactions of circulatory drugs are numerous, sometimes difficult to predict and they may lead to the intensification of the adverse drug reaction and lowering of their therapeutic efficacy.",M1
11035687,"Effects of cardiac <e>glycosides</e> on atrial contractile dysfunction after short-term atrial fibrillation.BACKGROUND: Despite a long history of use in the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), the efficacy of cardiac glycosides has not been established. If such drugs are beneficial in this condition, the general view is that the benefit must be related to their inotropic actions. METHODS AND RESULTS: To assess the effects of the rapid-acting cardiac glycoside, acetylstrophanthidin (AS), on AF and AF-induced right atrial (RA)  stunning,  RA wall motion (with ultrasonic crystals), RA pressure, and peak first derivative of pressure (dp/dt) (with microtip transducers) were measured before and after 5 min of high-intensity rapid atrial stimulation (10 Hz; 10 mA; 1 ms) and after the cessation of poststimulation AF. Measurements were made in neurally intact and autonomically blockaded dogs both before and after the administration of AS (0.01 mg/kg IV bolus and 0.015 mg/kg/h IV infusion). AS prevented the post-AF reduction in RA peak dp/dt under neurally intact and autonomically blockaded conditions, and it prevented the post-AF increase in the RA end-systolic dimension and the decrease in the percentage of RA systolic shortening with autonomic blockade. AS was beneficial whether or not baseline inotropy was enhanced by AS. The duration of AF following atrial stimulation was the same before and after AS, but when compared to controls, AS treatment appeared to prolong AF. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac glycosides exert a favorable effect on AF-induced RA stunning, but this action is unrelated to its effects on the duration of AF.",M1

This chinkerinchee species was previously linked to a condition known as 'kwylbek' krimpsiekte in small stock in the Beaufort West district of the Western Cape Province, South Africa. In a dosing trial, respiratory distress, tachycardia and sternal recumbency were observed in 2 sheep drenched with fresh plant material. A fluorescence polarisation immunoassay (FPIA) detected the presence of a substance that cross-reacted with digoxin antibodies in some of the plant material collected at Keetmanshoop and Beaufort West.

10926161,"Effect of dietary cardiac <e>glycosides</e> on blood pressure regulation in rats.To investigate the possible physiological significance of dietary cardiac glycosides in blood pressure regulation, the blood pressure of normal Sprague Dawley rats raised on a regular diet, which naturally contains large amounts of Na+-pump inhibitors, was compared with that of rats on a purified synthetic diet, which contains no Na+-pump specific inhibitors, and with that of rats on a synthetic diet supplemented with 10 microg x mL(-1) ouabain or 10 microg x mL- convallatoxin in the drinking water. After 6 weeks on the synthetic diet, the systolic blood pressure in the synthetic diet group was significantly elevated (145 +/- 5 vs. 128 +/- 4 mmHg, P &lt; 0.05). At 10 weeks it reached a plateau (154 +/- 3 vs. 122 +/- 3 mmHg, P &lt; 0.05). Plasma renin activity and Na+ level were significantly higher in animals fed synthetic diets than in the regular diet group (P &lt; 0.01). Administration of either losartan or lisinopril or a switch to a low salt synthetic diet (0.03% sodium) normalized the synthetic diet-induced high blood pressure. Supplementation of the synthetic diet with the cardiac glycosides delayed the onset of the increase in blood pressure for 4 weeks. Plasma aldosterone levels were approximately doubled in the cardiac glycoside-treated groups. Higher plasma Na+ levels and hematocrit values present in the synthetic diet group were normalized by the glycoside supplements. These results suggest that supplemental dietary cardiac glycosides exert bidirectional effects on blood pressure regulation through actions that modulate extracellular fluid and electrolyte balance.",M1
10768435,"Anti-digoxin Fab fragments in cardiotoxicity induced by ingestion of yellow oleander: a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Severe cardiac <e>glycoside</e> cardiotoxicity after ingestion of yellow oleander seeds is an important problem in rural areas of Sri Lanka. Currently, patients must be transferred to the capital for temporary cardiac pacing. We did a randomised controlled trial to investigate whether anti-digoxin Fab could reverse serious oleander-induced arrhythmias. METHODS: After a preliminary dose-finding study, 66 patients who presented to hospital with a serious cardiac arrhythmia were randomised to receive either 1200 mg of anti-digoxin Fab or a saline placebo. A 12-lead electrocardiogram, 3 min rhythm strip, and blood sample for measurement of electrolytes and cardiac glycosides were taken before treatment and at 12 timepoints thereafter. FINDINGS: 34 patients received anti-digoxin Fab and 32 received placebo. The presenting arrhythmia had resolved completely after 2 h in 15 antibody-treated patients and two controls (p&lt;0.001); 24 and five patients, respectively, were in sinus rhythm at 8 h (p&lt;0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to first reversal showed a significant response to anti-digoxin Fab. The heart rate increased in cases, from 49.1 per min at baseline to 66.8 at 2 h, but not in controls (50.6 per min at baseline to 51.5; p&lt;0.001). Mean serum potassium concentrations decreased from 4.9 mmol/L to 4.1 mmol/L at 2 h in cases; no such decrease occurred in controls. INTERPRETATION: Anti-digoxin Fab fragments are a safe and effective treatment for serious cardiac arrhythmias induced by yellow oleander. Their use in small rural hospitals in Sri Lanka should minimise costly transfer of patients and reduce the numbers of deaths; however, further study will be required to confirm this reduction.",M1
10757415,"In-vivo and in-vitro evidence of a carrier-mediated efflux transport system for oestrone-3-sulphate across the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.The efflux transport of oestrone-3-sulphate, a steroid hormone sulphate, across the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier has been examined following its intracerebroventricular administration. [3H]Oestrone-3-sulphate was eliminated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an apparent efflux clearance of 205 microL min(-1) per rat. There was 25% of unmetabolized [3H]oestrone-3-sulphate in the plasma 5 min after intracerebroventricular administration, indicating that at least a part of [3H]oestrone-3-sulphate is transported from CSF to the circulating blood across the blood-CSF barrier. This efflux transport was inhibited by co-administration of excess oestrone-3-sulphate (25 mM 10 microL = 0.25 micromol) into rat cerebral ventricle. To characterize the oestrone-3-sulphate transport process, an in-vitro uptake experiment was performed using isolated rat choroid plexus. Oestrone-3-sulphate uptake by isolated rat choroid plexus was found to be a saturable process with a Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 18.1 +/- 6.3 microM, and a maximum uptake rate (Vmax) of 48.0 +/- 15.1 pmol min(-1) microL(-1) of tissue. The oestrone-3-sulphate transport process was temperature dependent and was inhibited by metabolic inhibitors such as 2,4-dinitrophenol and rotenone, suggesting an energy dependence. This uptake process was also inhibited by steroid hormone sulphates (1 mM dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and 1 mM oestrone sulphate), bile acids (1 mM taurocholic acid and 1 mM cholic acid) and organic anions (1 mM sulphobromophthalein and 1 mM phenolsulphonphthalein), whereas 1 mM p-aminohippuric acid, 1 mM p-nitrophenol sulphate, 0.1 mM methotrexate and the cardiac <e>glycoside</e>, 2.5 microM digoxin, had little effect. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that oestrone-3-sulphate is transported from CSF to the circulating blood across the blood-CSF barrier via a carrier-mediated efflux transport system.",M1

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Medical wards of Anuradhapura District General Hospital, Sri Lanka, and coronary care unit of the Institute of Cardiology, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, the national tertiary referral centre for cardiology. PATIENTS: 351 patients with a history of oleander ingestion. MEASUREMENTS: ECG and blood sample analysis on admission. RESULTS: Most symptomatic patients had conduction defects affecting the sinus node, the atrioventricular (AV) node, or both. Patients showing cardiac arrhythmias that required transfer for specialised management had significantly higher mean serum cardiac glycoside and potassium but not magnesium concentrations. Although there was considerable overlap between groups, those with conduction defects affecting both sinus and AV nodes had significantly higher mean serum cardiac glycoside levels. CONCLUSIONS: Most of these young previously healthy patients had conduction defects affecting the sinus or AV nodes. Relatively few had the atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias or ventricular ectopic beats that are typical of digoxin poisoning. Serious yellow oleander induced arrhythmias were associated with higher serum cardiac glycoside concentrations and hyperkalaemia but not with disturbances of magnesium.",M1
10483514,"Effects of AL 107, a novel semisynthetic cardiac <e>glycoside</e>, on the cardiovascular system in anaesthetized beagle dogs with pentobarbital-induced cardiac insufficiency.The inotropic efficacy, arrhythmogenicity and cardiohaemodynamic properties of AL 107 (3-alpha-methyl-digitoxigenin glucoside, CAS 62190-59-4), a novel cardiac glycoside, were studied in anaesthetized dogs with pentobarbital-induced acute cardiac insufficiency. Three groups of dogs received AL 107, ouabain or verhicle. The cardiac glycosides were infused intravenously in eight increasing dose levels which where given cumulatively. Slope of left ventricular pressure rise (LVdp/dtmax) increased in the AL 107- and ouabain-treated groups. At the end of the 6th dose level ouabain caused a significantly higher LVdp/dtmax (137 +/- 15% of the baseline value taken before induction of insufficiency) than AL 107 (94 +/- 9%). Further increase of the dose resulted in a reduction of LVdp/dtmax in ouabain-treated dogs, whereas AL 107 continuously increased LVdp/dtmax up to the highest dose infused, where 130 +/- 16% of the baseline value was reached. In ouabain-treated dogs, ECG abnormalities accompanied the decrease of LVdp/dtmax whereas ECG-changes did not interfere with the development of left ventricular contractility in AL 107-treated dogs. The 6th dose of ouabain provoked a maximal increase of cardiac output (CO) (up to 107 +/- 8% of baseline values) and stroke volume (SV) (up to 122 +/- 6% of baseline values) which decreased upon further dose elevation. In the dose-range studied AL-107 induced a continuous increase of both parameters which, however, hardly reached the baseline values. ECG abnormalities occurred in both substance-treated groups and showed quantitative but not qualitative differences. The ECG showed rapid recovery after cessation of AL 107 infusion but did not normalize during a postinfusional recovery period of 1 h after treatment with ouabain. In conclusion, AL 107 increased cardiac performance in an acute canine model of cardiac insufficiency. It was slightly less active than ouabain. However, the ECG disorders were more moderate in AL 107--than in ouabain-treated dogs, a difference which was most pronounced with respect to reversibility in the postinfusional period.",M1

9789548,"Ligand binding sites of Na,K-ATPase.Our studies have concentrated on two aspects of the Na,K-ATPase, the first relates to the identification of amino acids involved in binding Na+ and K+ during the catalytic cycle and the second involves defining how cardiac <e>glycosides</e> inhibit the enzyme. To date, three amino acids, Ser775, Asp804 and Asp808, all located in transmembrane regions five and six, have been shown to play a major role in K+ binding. These findings are based on site directed mutagenesis and expression studies. In order to understand how cardiac glycosides interact with the Na,K-ATPase, studies again involving mutagenesis coupled with expression have been used. More specifically, amino acid residues have been substituted in an ouabain sensitive alpha subunit using random mutagenesis, and the ability of the resulting enzyme to confer resistance to ouabain sensitive cells was determined. Interestingly, the amino acids of the alpha subunit which alter ouabain sensitivity cluster in two major regions, one comprised of the first and second transmembrane spanning domains and the extracellular loop joining them, and the second formed by the extracellular halves of transmembrane regions four, five, six and seven. As noted above, transmembrane regions five and six also contain the three amino acid residues Ser775, Asp804 and Asp808 which play a key role in cation transport, possibly binding K+. Thus, it is reasonable to propose that cardiac glycosides bind to two sites, the N- terminal region and the central region which contains the cation binding sites. Cardiac glycoside binding to the center region may lock the cation transport region into a configuration such that the enzyme cannot go through the conformational change required for ion transport.",M1

Even very high concentrations of other steroids, such as estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, and cortisone, did not prevent HDMA-labeling (at 5 and 100 nM) of CGBG, but the cardenolides ouabain and digoxin or the bufadienolide proscillaridin A did so. CGBG is a homodimer of two 26-kDa subunits forming disulfide bonds, since HDMA labeling of a protein of 53 kDa was observed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when beta-mercaptoethanol was absent during SDS denaturation. The N-terminal amino acid sequence K-D-V-Y-R-A-P-D-G-T-Q-S-A showed no sequence similarity with proteins recorded in gene and protein sequence data banks. A 90-kDa cytosolic CGBG exists in bovine kidneys and reacts with antibodies against CGBG. Binding of ouabain to the cardiac glycoside-binding globulin was monitored by quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Such studies reveal two negatively cooperative ouabain binding sites with Kd' of 1.52 nM and Kd' = 75 nM and with an interaction factor of 50 using a Koshland-Némethy-Filmer model. The demonstration of a cardiac glycoside-binding globulin in plasma is consistent with the recent finding of endogenous cardiac glycosides in mammals.",M1
9578549,"Identification of a model cardiac <e>glycoside</e> receptor: comparisons with Na+,K+-ATPase.The availability of high-affinity anti-digoxin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offers the potential for their use as models for the characterization of the relationship between receptor structure and cardiac glycoside binding. We have characterized the binding of anthroylouabain (AO), a fluorescent derivative of the cardiac glycoside ouabain, to mAbs 26-10, 45-20, and 40-50 [Mudgett-Hunter, M., et al. (1995) Mol. Immunol. 22, 477] and lamb kidney Na+, K+-ATPase by monitoring the resultant AO fluorescence emission spectra, anisotropy, lifetime values, and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from protein tryptophan(s) (Trp) to AO. These data suggest that the structural environment in the vicinity of the AO-binding site of Na+,K+-ATPase is similar to that of mAb 26-10 but not mAbs 45-20 and 40-50. A model of AO complexed to the antigen binding fragment (Fab) of mAb 26-10 which was generated using known X-ray crystal structural data [Jeffrey, P. D., et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 10310] shows a heavy chain Trp residue (Trp-H100) that is close ( approximately 3 A) to the anthroyl moiety. This is consistent with the energy transfer seen upon AO binding to mAb 26-10 and suggests that Trp-H100, which is part of the antibody's cardiac glycoside binding site, is a major determinant of the fluorescence properties of bound AO. In contrast, the generated model of AO complexed to Fab 40-50 [Jeffrey, P. D., et al. (1995) J. Mol. Biol. 248, 344] shows a heavy chain Tyr residue (Tyr-H100) which is part of the cardiac glycoside binding site, located approximately 10 A from the anthroyl moiety. The closest Trp residues (H52 and L35) are located approximately 17 A from the anthroyl moiety, and no FRET is observed despite the fact that these Trp residues are close enough for significant FRET to occur. The energy transfer seen upon AO binding to Na+,K+-ATPase suggests the presence of one completely quenched or two highly quenched enzyme Trp residues approximately 10 and approximately 17 A, respectively, from the anthroyl moiety. These data suggest that the Na+,K+-ATPase Trp residue(s) involved in fluorescence energy transfer to AO is likely to be part of the cardiac glycoside binding site.",M1

Toelken subsp. wallichii.The specific neurotoxic principle of Tylecodon wallichii (Harv.) Toelken subsp. wallichii, the cause of krimpsiekte in small stock, was isolated and identified as the previously described cumulative bufadienolide, cotyledoside. Krimpsiekte was experimentally induced in two sheep by the repeated intravenous administration of cotyledoside at the rate of 0.01-0.015 mg/kg body mass. On day 9, both animals developed clinical signs typical of krimpsiekte, which is characterized by tremors, paresis and recumbency. Both sheep had difficulty in controlling their hindquarters when attempting to lie down. No significant electrocardiograph abnormalities were detected during the experiment which confirms that cotyledoside at low doses does not overtly affect the electrical activity of the heart. No gross lesions were observed in the sheep. The most significant microscopic lesions comprised mild brain oedema and pronounced vacuolation of the white matter of thalamic nuclei. These lesions might explain some of the motor function deficiencies clinically observed in this syndrome. The previously held contention that these neurotoxic cardiac glycosides are indeed the cause of krimpsiekte is, therefore, confirmed.",M1

9371549,"Influence of extracellular K+ concentration on the time-course of Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition by cardiac <e>glycosides</e> with fast and low binding kinetics.The magnitude of the K+ antagonism of cardiac glycoside binding to Na+/K+-ATPase prepared from porcine heart, was estimated from the enzyme activities determined in the presence of different concentrations of K+ ([K+]), ouabain, and alpha-methyl-digitoxigenin-glucoside, the latter showing a 30 fold greater dissociation rate than ouabain. An increase of [K+] (3-20 mmol/l) prolonged the half-lives of Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition and caused a rightward shift of the cardiac glycoside's dose-response curves by the same factor, almost maximal (4 fold) at 14 mmol/l K+. These data could be verified from the cardiac glycoside-elevated intravesicular Na+ concentrations of rat brain vesicles. These concentrations declined rapidly in brain vesicles treated with alpha-methyl-digitoxigenin-glucoside but not with ouabain after K+ was increased from 3.5 to 14 mM. The results suggest that the magnitude of the K+ antagonism under physiological conditions is only limited by the lifespan of the cardiac glycoside-binding E2P enzyme conformation reduced by K+.",M1
9363783,"Fluoresceinyl-ethylenediamine-ouabain detects an acidic environment in the cardiac <e>glycoside</e> binding site of Na+/K+-ATPase.To probe the pH value in the microenvironment of the cardiac glycoside-binding site of Na+/K+-ATPase, pH-sensitive fluorescent derivatives of ouabain were synthesized. The fluoresceinyl derivative of ethylenediamino-ouabain (FEDO) had a pKs of 6.0 and showed a H+-dependent fluorescence change, when its ratio of excitation at 490 nm/450 nm was recorded at 530 nm. Binding of FEDO inactivated Na+/K+-ATPase at 37 degrees C and pH 7.25 in a slow time-dependent process under the conditions of backdoor phosphorylation with k(on) of 891 s(-1) M(-1). The complex dissociated with k(on) of 0.35 x 10(-3) s(-1) resulting in a Kd value of 0.4 microM for the FEDO x enzyme complex. Binding of FEDO was associated with a decrease of the excitatory fluorescence ratio at 490 nm/450 nm which could be used to convert this change into a pH value. A pH value of 5.1 +/- 0.2 was calculated to exist in the microenvironment of the FEDO x enzyme complex. This pH value was independent of the pH of the incubation medium used to form the FEDO x enzyme complex. Analysis of the accessibility of the fluorophore in the FEDO x enzyme complex to the dynamic quencher potassium iodide detected a decrease of the Stern-Volmer constant from 6.2 mM(-1) (free FEDO) to 1.5 mM(-1) (FEDO x enzyme complex) indicating thereby a limited accessibility of the fluorophore to anions. Analysis of the microenvironment of the fluorescein residue of the FEDO x enzyme complex by measurements of the anisotropy and the fluorescence half-life time revealed that both processes differed significantly when H2O was replaced by D2O. We conclude, therefore, that a pH of 5.1 +/- 0.2 exists in the vicinity of ouabain that is hidden in the depth of the receptor site when the ouabain receptor complex has been formed.",M1
9322594,"Rapid detection of oleander poisoning using fluorescence polarization immunoassay for digitoxin. Effect of treatment with digoxin-specific Fab antibody fragment (ovine).Poisoning from the oleander plant is common. Taking advantage of the high cross-reactivity of oleandrin, the major cardiac <e>glycoside</e> found in the oleander plant, we demonstrated that the serum digitoxin assay can be successfully used for the rapid diagnosis of oleander poisoning. Digitoxin is rarely used for treatment of cardiac disorders in the United States and has a therapeutic range of 19.7 to 39.3 nmol/L. In a typical oleander poisoning, serum oleandrin concentrations may reach 174 mmol/L or more. A serum specimen supplemented with 174 mmol/L of oleandrin containing no digitoxin showed an apparent digitoxin concentration of 1,272.1 nmol/L, a very high value compared with the range of the serum digitoxin assay, which is 2.6 to 104.8 nmol/L. Moreover, the response of the serum digitoxin assay with serum specimens containing various concentrations of oleandrin (and no digitoxin) is linear. Therefore, the oleandrin concentration in serum can be calculated from the apparent digitoxin concentration to access the severity of poisoning. Recently, the usefulness of the digoxin-specific Fab antibody fragment in the treatment of oleander poisoning has been described; however, no laboratory test was performed to demonstrate the progress of therapy. We demonstrated that the digoxin-specific Fab antibody can bind oleandrin in vitro, thus reducing the pharmacologically active free oleandrin. Because Fab and oleandrin bound to Fab are absent in the protein-free ultrafiltrates, monitoring the activity of free oleandrin in the ultrafiltrates can be used for monitoring the effectiveness of therapy.",M1
9315538,"Modulation of cytokine production and protection against lethal endotoxemia by the cardiac <e>glycoside</e> ouabain.BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that cytokines are capable of modulating cardiovascular function and that some drugs used in the treatment of heart failure variably modulate the production of cytokines. To examine whether cardiac glycosides also modulate cytokine production, we evaluated the effects of ouabain on the production of cytokines in vitro and in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from healthy volunteers. PBMC were cultured with or without ouabain in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Ouabain induced the production of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in PBMC and induced mRNA of these cytokines, an induction apparently at the transcriptional level. Amiloride, staurosporin, and genistein inhibited cytokine production, and protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase appeared to be involved in the modulation of cytokine production induced by ouabain. However, when PBMC were stimulated with LPS, ouabain suppressed the production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. To investigate whether ouabain modulates cytokine production in vivo, we evaluated the effects of ouabain in LPS-treated mice. Ouabain was found to protect against LPS-induced lethal toxicity in mice and decreased circulating IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These previously unrecognized immunomodulating effects of a cardiac glycoside may explain either the beneficial or the detrimental effects of these drugs in heart failure patients.",M1
9294213,"Isolation of a multispecific organic anion and cardiac <e>glycoside</e> transporter from rat brain.A novel multispecific organic anion transporting polypeptide (oatp2) has been isolated from rat brain. The cloned cDNA contains 3,640 bp. The coding region extends over 1,983 nucleotides, thus encoding a polypeptide of 661 amino acids. Oatp2 is homologous to other members of the oatp gene family of membrane transporters with 12 predicted transmembrane domains, five potential glycosylation, and six potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. In functional expression studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes, oatp2 mediated uptake of the bile acids taurocholate (Km approximately 35 microM) and cholate (Km approximately 46 microM), the estrogen conjugates 17beta-estradiol-glucuronide (Km approximately 3 microM) and estrone-3-sulfate (Km approximately 11 microM), and the cardiac gylcosides ouabain (Km approximately 470 microM) and digoxin (Km approximately 0.24 microM). Although most of the tested compounds are common substrates of several oatp-related transporters, high-affinity uptake of digoxin is a unique feature of the newly cloned oatp2. On the basis of Northern blot analysis under high-stringency conditions, oatp2 is highly expressed in brain, liver, and kidney but not in heart, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, and testes. These results provide further support for the overall significance of oatps as a new family of multispecific organic anion transporters. They indicate that oatp2 may play an especially important role in the brain accumulation and toxicity of digoxin and in the hepatobiliary and renal excretion of cardiac glycosides from the body.",M1
9164359,"Inhibition of peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation by cardiac <e>glycosides</e>.INTRODUCTION: Prior studies have shown that ouabain, a cardiac glycoside that inhibits the sodium, potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+,K+ ATPase) enzyme, downregulates phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) proliferation. OBJECTIVE: This study examined and compared the effects of both ouabain and digoxin, a cardiac glycoside used therapeutically in humans, on PBMNC proliferation. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy human subjects, incubated for 72 hours with and without PHA (2%) in the presence and absence of ouabain (10(-12) M to 10(-4) M) or digoxin (10(-9) M to 10(-6) M), and pulsed with 3H thymidine. RESULTS: For PHA-stimulated PBMNCs in the ouabain-treated group (n = 10 subjects), the mean (+/-STD) % uptake (% 3H thymidine uptake in absence of ouabain) was 80.5 +/- 6.0 at 10(-12) M ouabain, 73.1 +/- 8.4 at 10(-10) M, 47.89 +/- 13.1 at 10(-8) M, 6.9 +/- 3.2 at 10(-6) M, and 3.4 +/- 1.6 at 10(-4) M. For PHA-stimulated cells in the digoxin-treated group (n = 9 subjects), the mean (+/-STD) % uptake (% 3H thymidine uptake in absence of digoxin) was 89.8 +/- 9.8 at 10(-9) M digoxin, 92.6 +/- 8.2 at 10(-8) M, 54.3 +/- 19.8 at 10(-7) M, and 1.0 +/- 2.4 at 10(-6) M. Repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated a significant effect of concentration of both glycosides on PBMNC proliferation (P &lt; .01). The inhibitory effect was reversible, but was largely abbrogated if ouabain was added after 48 hours of incubation with PHA. Further, the inhibitory effect extended to PBMNCs stimulated with recall antigen (tetanus) and to fractionated PBMNCs (CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+) stimulated with mitogens. Additionally, dose-response inhibitory effects of glycosides on PBMNC Na+,K+ ATPase enzyme activity and interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion by PHA-stimulated PBMNC were also noted. Neither glycoside had an effect on spontaneous PBMNC proliferation (no PHA) or trypan blue exclusion. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that both cardiac glycosides inhibited PHA-induced PBMNC proliferation, possibly via Na+,K+ ATPase inhibition, but not via cell toxicity. The concentration range over which inhibition was observed was similar for both glycosides. The results raise the possibility that therapeutic or toxic doses of digoxin could have an effect on cell-mediated immunity in vivo.",M1

Derivatives of oleandrin are structurally similar to digoxin. We investigated the cross-reactivities of oleandrin and its aglycone metabolite, oleandrigenin, in several commercially available digoxin immunoassays; assessed their ability to inhibit Na,K-ATPase catalytic activity; and measured their binding to proteins in serum. As assayed with ACS:180, Stratus, RIA, On-Line, and TDx digoxin assays, oleandrin at 100 micromol/L in digoxin-free serum gave apparent digoxin values of 0, 0.83, 2.24, 2.37, and 5.34 nmol/L, respectively, whereas oleandrigenin at that concentration gave results of 0, 0.52, 0.77, 4.94, and 1.40 nmol/L. Study of Na,K-ATPase inhibition showed IC50 values (micromol/L) of 0.22 for ouabain, 0.62 for oleandrin, 1.23 for oleandrigenin, and 2.69 for digoxin. At 25 degrees C, 96% of oleandrin and 48% of oleandrigenin were bound to serum proteins. Because detection of oleandrin and oleandrigenin by digoxin immunoassays is variable between assays as well as between congeners, assessment of cross-reactivity is warranted for each assay. The inhibition of Na,K-ATPase by oleandrin and oleandrigenin confirms that they likely exert their toxic effects through inhibition of sodium pump activity. In cases of digitalis-like poisoning with suspicion of oleander ingestion, a combination of digoxin immunoassays may be useful to effectively rule out the presence of oleander.",M1
8662895,"Ouabain interactions with the H5-H6 hairpin of the Na,K-ATPase reveal a possible inhibition mechanism via the cation binding domain.Cardiac <e>glycosides</e> such as ouabain and digoxin specifically inhibit the Na,K-ATPase. Three new residues in the carboxyl half of the Na, K-ATPase, Phe-786, Leu-793 (PFLIF786IIANIPL793PLGT797), and Phe-863 (FTYF863VIM) have been identified as ouabain sensitivity determinants using random mutagenesis. Polymerase chain reaction was utilized to randomly mutate the DNA sequence encoding the amino acids between Lys-691 and Lys-945 in the alpha subunit of the Na, K-ATPase. This region contains four transmembrane segments (H5, H6, H7, and H8) and the connecting extracellular and cytoplasmic loops. Diverse substitutions of these three residues resulted in proteins displaying 2.8-48-fold increases in the I50 of different cardiac glycosides for inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase activity. By locating these residues, in conjunction with Thr-797 (Feng, J., and Lingrel, J. B (1994) Biochemistry 33, 4218-4224), a new region of the protein containing the H5-H6 hairpin and the H7 transmembrane segment emerges as a major determinant of ouabain inhibition. Thus, a link between the cardiac glycoside binding site and the cation transport sites of the Na,K-ATPase transpires giving a structural base to the cation antagonism of ouabain binding. Furthermore, this link suggests a possible mechanism for cardiac glycoside inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase, such that ouabain binding to the implicated region blocks the movement of the H5 and H6 transmembrane domains which may be required for energy transduction and cation transport.",M1

METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of TS on tumor cells were determined by trypan blue dye exclusion, neutral red vital staining and clonogenic assay. The time-effect relationship and growth inhibition of tumor cells by TS were assayed with trypan blue exclusion method. RESULTS: TS at low doses (0.005-0.1 mg.L-1), with dose dependence, was able to kill SMMC-7721, SGC-7901 and HeLa cells. IC50 values for SMMC-7721, SGC-7901 and HeLa cells were 0.007, 0.011 and 0.018 mg.L-1 by trypan blue dye exclusion test and 0.016, 0.055 and 0.078 mg.L-1 by neutral red vital staining test. TS inhibited the clonal forming rate of SMMC-7721 and SGC-7901 significantly with IC50 values of 0.021 and 0.036 mg.L-1, respectively. Only when the cells were continuously treated with TS for more than 8 hours, the drug-induced cell lethality could be displayed and strengthened quickly. The growth of tumor cells was notably inhibited after they were exposed to 0.1 microgram/ml of TS for 12 hours. All the experimental results of antitumor activity in vitro showed that SMMC-7721 was most sensitive to TS among the three kinds of tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: TS has cytotoxic action on tumor cells cultured in vitro and this lethal effect must have an action process, in which tumor cells are not dead but suffer from deadly injury and lost the capability of unlimited proliferation.",M1

We tested the hypothesis of whether increased expression of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in failing human myocardium is accompanied by enhanced sensitivity of the failing human myocardium toward cardiac glycosides and Na+ -channel activators. We studied the positive inotropic effects of the new Na+ -channel activator BDF and the cardiac glycoside ouabain in human failing (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class IV, heart transplants for dilated cardiomyopathy, n = 11) and nonfailing (donor hearts, n = 5) myocardium on electrically driven left ventricular papillary muscle strips (1 Hz, 37 degrees C). The effectiveness of ouabain and BDF to increase force of contraction was similar in human nonfailing and failing myocardium. BDF was more potent to increase force of contraction in failing than in nonfailing tissue (p &lt; 0.05). The time until maximal inotropic effect developed after ouabain was significantly shorter in NYHA IV (mean 150 +/- 16 min) than in nonfailing myocardium (mean 240 +/- 20 min). These results suggest that human failing myocardium exerts and enhanced sensitivity to cardiac glycosides and Na+ -channel activators, possibly because of enhanced expression of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger or because of an altered intracellular Na+ -homeostasis.",M1

To study the role of this Cys on ion transport activity, we measured pump currents in HeLa cells expressing wild-type or mutant alpha 1-subunit cDNAs. The endogenous ouabainsensitive Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase was selectively inhibited by growing the cells in 0.1 microM ouabain. A Cys-to-Tyr substituted mutant exhibited decreased sensitivity to digitoxin but not digoxin compared with wild type. The decreased affinity for digitoxin was due to a faster dissociation rate. In contrast, the Cys-to-Ala substitution did not significantly alter the sensitivity to digitoxin or digoxin. Both wild-type and mutant cells displayed marked external K(+)-dependent pump currents; however, the affinity for K+ was reduced by the mutations. The decrease in K+ affinity was due to a slower association rate. The results show that the Cys that interacts with cardiac glycosides also participates in the sensitivity of the pump to external K+.",M1
8770197,"The carbohydrate moieties of the beta-subunit of Na+, K(+)-ATPase: their lateral motions and proximity to the cardiac <e>glycoside</e> site.The beta-subunit associated with the catalytic (alpha) subunit of the mammalian Na+, K(+) -ATPase is a transmembrane glycoprotein with three extracellularly located N-glycosylation sites. Although beta appears to be essential for a functional enzyme, the role of beta and its sugars remains unknown. In these studies, steady-state and dynamic fluorescence measurements of the fluorophore lucifer yellow (LY) covalently linked to the carbohydrate chains of beta have demonstrated that the bound probes are highly solvent exposed but restricted in their diffusional motions. Furthermore, the probes' environments on beta were not altered by Na+ or K+ or ouabain-induced enzyme conformational changes, but both divalent cation and oligomycin addition evoked modest changes in LY fluorescence. Frequency domain measurements reflecting the Förster fluorescence energy transfer (FET) occurring between anthroylouabain (AO) bound to the cardiac glycoside receptor site on alpha and the carbohydrate-linked LY demonstrated their close proximity (18 A). Additional FET determinations made between LY as donor and erythrosin-5-isothiocyanate, covalently bound at the enzyme's putative ATP binding site domain, indicated that a distance of about 85 A separates these two regions and that this distance is reduced upon divalent cation binding and increased upon the Na+E1--&gt;K+E2 conformational transition. These data suggest a model for the localization of the terminal moieties of the oligosaccharides that places them, on average, about 18 A from the AO binding site and this distance or less from the extracellular membrane surface.",M1
7586451,"Direct effects of protamine sulfate on myocyte contractile processes. Cellular and molecular mechanisms.BACKGROUND: Administration of the arginine-rich, highly charged protamine (PROT) molecule has been associated with episodes of acute left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that PROT has direct effects on isolated LV myocyte contractile processes and sarcolemmal transduction systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: Exposure of porcine LV myocytes (n = 305) to 40 micrograms/mL PROT (reflecting a dose of 2.5 mg/kg) decreased basal contractile function and beta-adrenergic responsiveness. For example, myocyte percent shortening was 4.3 +/- 0.1% in control myocytes and decreased to 2.8 +/- 0.2% in the presence of 40 micrograms/mL PROT (P &lt; .05). Myocyte percent shortening was 9.3 +/- 0.7% after beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation (isoproterenol; 25 nmol/L) and was significantly reduced in the presence of 40 micrograms/mL PROT (5.7 +/- 0.7%, P &lt; .05). PROT reduced myocyte responsiveness to forskolin (100 mumol/L), which directly activates adenylate cyclase, by &gt; 40% from forskolin. In addition, PROT abolished the inotropic effects of ouabain on myocyte contractile function. To determine contributory mechanisms for the effects of PROT on myocyte sarcolemmal systems, beta-receptor- and cardiac <e>glycoside</e>-binding characteristics were determined in sarcolemmal preparations. beta-receptor binding was 175 +/- 10 fmol/mg and was reduced to 140 +/- 6 fmol/mg in the presence of PROT (P &lt; .05). Ouabain receptor binding was 7.1 pmol/mg and decreased to 2.6 +/- 0.4 pmol/mg in the presence of PROT. In addition, cAMP production after stimulation with isoproterenol and forskolin was significantly blunted in the presence of PROT. Variants of the PROT moelcule were constructed by specific amino acid substitutions and deletions, which provided a means to vary charge as well as structure. Substitution of arginine with lysine in the PROT peptide sequence ameliorated the negative effects on myocyte contractile processes; despite identical overall charge (21+). However, a PROT variant with an 18+ charge but different amino acid sequence induced significant negative effects on myocyte function and inotropic responsiveness. Thus, the effects of PROT on myocyte contractile processes are not due simply to the high positive charge of the molecule. To further establish that PROT can contribute to changes in LV function in the clinical setting, fluorescein-labeled PROT was circulated in antegradely perfused rabbit hearts. Microscopic examination revealed that PROT could traverse the vascular compartment of the myocardium and come in direct contact with the myocyte. CONCLUSIONS: The unique findings from the present study suggest that a fundamental contributory mechanisms for the changes in LV function observed after protamine administration may be the direct effect of unbound protamine on myocyte contractile processes.",M1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of antibodies against cardiac glycosides on Na+, K(+)-ATPase in human erythrocytes. For this purpose, we measured the effect of antibodies against two different cardiac glycosides (anti-ouabain rabbit antiserum and anti-digoxin Fab fragments) on the activity of the Na+, K(+)-ATPase, as measured by erythrocyte rubidium-86 (86Rb) uptake, in subjects who had never come into contact with exogenous cardiac glycosides, and compared these results with the effect of two control rabbit sera: a normal serum and an antiserum to a non-related antigen. Anti-ouabain rabbit antiserum and anti-digoxin Fab fragments induced a significantly greater percentage change in 86Rb uptake in the erythrocytes than the two control sera (ANOVA followed by multiple comparison by the Games-Howell test). The average percentage change was +11.8 +/- 16.3% (n = 19) (mean +/- SD) for anti-ouabain antiserum +10.8 +/- 15.6% (n = 23) for anti-digoxin Fab fragments, -1.68 +/- 11.2% (n = 11) for anti-rhGM-CSF antiserum, and -5.8 +/- 11.7 (n = 10) for normal control serum. In a subgroup of ten subjects in whom the 3 antisera were tested simultaneously, the stimulation of erythrocyte 86Rb uptake induced by the two antidigitalis antibodies correlated significantly (r = 0.906, p = 0.001, n = 10).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1

7851443,"Affinity labeling of a sulfhydryl group in the cardiacglycoside receptor site of Na+/K(+)-ATPase by N-hydroxysuccinimidyl derivatives of digoxigenin.Na+/K(+)-ATPase from pig kidney is inactivated by protein-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimidyl derivatives of digoxigenin. Like digoxigenin, its protein-reactive derivatives N-hydroxysuccinimidyl digoxigenin-3-methylcarbonyl-epsilon-aminocaproate (HDMA), 3-amino-3-deoxydigoxigenin hemisuccinimide succinimidyl ester (ADHS), 3-iodoacetylamino-3-deoxydigoxigenin (IAD) and digoxigenin-3-O-succinyl-[2-(N-maleimido)]ethylamide (DSME) inhibited the sodium pump in the presence of Na+, Mg2+ and ATP. At 37 degrees C, half-maximal inhibition of Na+/K(+)-ATPase was seen by HDMA at 0.47 microM, by ADHS at 5.8 microM, by IAD at 8 microM and by DSME at 94 microM. Thus, all compounds bind to the cardiac steroid receptor site of Na+/K(+)-ATPase. Affinity labeling of the alpha subunit by 'front door' or 'back door' phosphorylation was only seen with HDMA or ADHS in the range 0.1 microM. Excess of ouabain protected against affinity labeling. All the other protein-reactive derivatives of digoxigenin labeled the enzyme independent of the formation of a phosphointermediate at much higher concentrations. This labeling was not suppressed by an excess of ouabain. Tryptic hydrolysis of the HDMA-modified Na+/K(+)-ATPase gave peptides of the apparent molecular masses 20, 12.5 and 11.2 kDa. The 11.2-kDa and 12.5-kDa peptides started amino-terminally with Asp68, and the 20-kDa peptide with Asp24. Thus, the HDMA-labeled peptides originate from the cardioactive steroid-binding site formed by the first and second transmembrane helix. N-Hydroxysuccinimidyl esters such as HDMA are normally thought to modify lysine and arginine residues covalently. Since such residues do not exist in the putative cardiac <e>glycoside</e>-binding site, the possibility of a thioester formation of the digoxigenin derivatives HDMA and ADHS with Cys104 in the H1 transmembrane domain was tested. In fact, hydroxylaminolysis led to the release of the covalently bound HDMA, and the formation of a free sulfhydryl group. This could be labeled by [2-14C]ICH2COOH. We therefore propose, consistent with a recent conclusion from a site-directed mutagenesis experiment [Canessa, C. M., Horisberger, J.-D., Louvard, D. &amp; Rossier, B. C. (1992) EMBO J. 11, 1681-1687], that a cysteine residue (probably Cys104) participates in the structure and function of the cardiac glycoside binding.",M1
7738826,"The effect of cardiac <e>glycosides</e> on the Na+ pump current-voltage relationship of isolated rat and guinea-pig heart cells.1. Whole-cell recording from isolated rat and guinea-pig ventricular myocytes revealed a change of the cardiac Na+ pump current (Ip)-voltage (V) relationship by cardiac glycosides, specific inhibitors of the Na(+)-K+ pump. 2. Dihydro-ouabain (DHO) diminished Ip in rat ventricular cells at 0 mV in a concentration-dependent manner. 3. The concentration-response curve of Ip inhibition caused by DHO was shifted to higher [DHO] at higher extracellular K+ concentrations ([K+]o) or at more negative membrane potentials. 4. In rat myocytes, DHO immediately flattened the normalized cardiac Ip-V curve and evoked or enhanced a region of negative slope. 5. Ouabain, at concentrations which caused a comparable inhibition of Ip, exerted DHO-like effects on the Ip-V relationship of rat ventricular myocytes. However, the effects developed more slowly. 6. A slowly developing alteration of the Ip-V curve was also observed upon application of DHO to guinea-pig ventricular cells. The range of [DHO] used was about 100-fold lower than that applied to rat ventricular cells, but was equally effective for Ip inhibition. 7. Increasing the K+ concentration of DHO-containing media affected the existing equilibrium of DHO binding to the cardiac Na(+)-K+ pump. A new equilibrium was reached within about 3 s in rat ventricular myocytes, but only within about 50 s in guinea-pig ventricular cells under the experimental conditions chosen. 8. It is concluded that the changes of the cardiac Ip-V curve induced by cardiac glycosides are mediated by voltage-dependent variations of the local [K+]o at the K+ binding sites of the Na(+)-K+ pump in an 'access channel'. The variations were estimated by means of the Boltzmann equation. The estimations agreed with those derived from the measured DHO binding to the Na(+)-K+ pump at various [K+]o. A new equilibrium of glycoside binding to the pump is established at the altered [K+]o. The time necessary to reach the new binding equilibrium varies with the cardioactive steroid, its concentration and the glycoside sensitivity of the cardiac cells.",M1

The efficacy of deglucohyrcanoside et least to that of digoxin, while the toxicity of the former is several times lower, makes the glycoside a potential candidate for therapeutic use.",M1
7929066,"Identification of an amino acid substitution in human alpha 1 Na,K-ATPase which confers differentially reduced affinity for two related cardiac <e>glycosides</e>.The ouabain-resistant cell line H1C1 displays a 30-fold differential of reduced sensitivity to the structurally related cardiac glycosides digoxin and digitoxin (Baker, R. M. (1976) in Biogenesis and Turnover of Membrane Macromolecules (Cook, J.S., ed) pp. 93-103, Raven Press, New York). Since these ligand congeners differ only by the presence of a hydroxyl group at C-12 of digoxin we predicted that the H1C1 phenotype must reflect a mutation which alters the binding site of the cardiac glycoside receptor (Na,K-ATPase). Complementary DNA encoding the alpha 1 Na,K-ATPase was prepared from H1C1 cell total RNA by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction and these cDNAs were cloned. Sequence analysis of the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction clones revealed several independent isolates containing a G &gt; A transition at nucleotide 332 of the propeptide coding sequence, generating the amino acid substitution C108Y. The ability of this substitution to confer differential sensitivity for digoxin and digitoxin was tested and confirmed by expressing a human alpha 1 C108Y-Na,K-ATPase in wild type HeLa cells and assaying for inhibition of cell growth and inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity. Phenylalanine or alanine substitutions of this cysteine also confer this pattern of ligand discrimination. Ouabain-resistant Na,K-ATPase substitutions, at positions other than Cys-108 failed to exhibit differential sensitivity indicating that this ligand discrimination is unique to Cys-108 substitutions rather than a general property of cardiac glycoside-resistant mutants. It is proposed that differential resistance of the C108Y receptor for these ligands is a consequence of altering two features of the ligand-receptor interaction; one, a disruption of a common hydrogen bond resulting in general loss of affinity for cardiac glycosides and the other, formation of a new H-bond between the C-12 hydroxyl of digoxin and the receptor, specifically augmenting the stability of this ligand-receptor complex.",M1

The inotropic effect was evaluated by the use of the systolic time intervals (left ventricular ejection time, LVET, and electromechanic systole, QS2) and by the QT-Interval of the ECG. The glycoside plasma level was measured simultaneously to the pharmacodynamic parameters by a radioimmunoassay, 16 alpha-gitoxin abbreviated dose-dependently the STI (LVET and QS2) for 30 (i.v.) or 15 ms (per os) and the QT interval for 35 ms. A mean plasma concentration of 401 ng/ml was measured 15 minutes after the i.v. injection of 5 mg and a mean plasma level of 402 ng/ml was measured 1 hour after the oral intake of 10 mg 16 alpha-gitoxin as an aqueous-ethanolic solution. The shortening of the STI-values and of the QT-interval correlated with the administered glycoside dose and with the AUC0-6-value. The AUC-values increased linearly with the administered dose. The ratio of the AUC0-6-values after i.v. or oral administration of 7.5 mg 16 alpha-gitoxin amounted to 0.673.

8061604,"Contribution of a single heavy chain residue to specificity of an anti-digoxin monoclonal antibody.Two distinct spontaneous variants of the murine anti-digoxin hybridoma 26-10 were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for reduced affinity of surface antibody for antigen. Nucleotide and partial amino acid sequencing of the variant antibody variable regions revealed that 1 variant had a single amino acid substitution: Lys for Asn at heavy chain position 35. The second variant antibody had 2 heavy chain substitutions: Tyr for Asn at position 35, and Met for Arg at position 38. Mutagenesis experiments confirmed that the position 35 substitutions were solely responsible for the markedly reduced affinity of both variant antibodies. Several mutants with more conservative position 35 substitutions were engineered to ascertain the contribution of Asn 35 to the binding of digoxin to antibody 26-10. Replacement of Asn with Gln reduced affinity for digoxin 10-fold relative to the wild-type antibody, but maintained wild-type fine specificity for cardiac <e>glycoside</e> analogues. All other substitutions (Val, Thr, Leu, Ala, and Asp) reduced affinity by at least 90-fold and caused distinct shifts in fine specificity. The Ala mutant demonstrated greatly increased relative affinities for 16-acetylated haptens and haptens with a saturated lactone. The X-ray crystal structure of the 26-10 Fab in complex with digoxin (Jeffrey PD et al., 1993, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90:10310-10314) reveals that the position 35 Asn contacts hapten and forms hydrogen bonds with 2 other contact residues. The reductions in affinity of the position 35 mutants for digoxin are greater than expected based upon the small hapten contact area provided by the wild-type Asn. We therefore performed molecular modeling experiments which suggested that substitution of Gln or Asp can maintain these hydrogen bonds whereas the other substituted side chains cannot. The altered binding of the Asp mutant may be due to the introduction of a negative charge. The similarities in binding of the wild-type and Gln-mutant antibodies, however, suggest that these hydrogen bonds are important for maintaining the architecture of the binding site and therefore the affinity and specificity of this antibody. The Ala mutant eliminates the wild-type hydrogen bonding, and molecular modeling suggests that the reduced side-chain volume also provides space that can accommodate a congener with a 16-acetyl group or saturated lactone, accounting for the altered fine specificity of this antibody.",M1
7976380,"[Inhibitory effects of 6 cardiac <e>glycosides</e> on sodium pump in sheep Purkinje fibers]The inhibitory effects of 6 cardiac glycosides (digoxin, meproscillarin, acrihellin, deslanoside, ouabain, K-strophanthin) on sodium pump in sheep Purkinje fibers were studied. Isolated Purkinje fibers were used and stimulated at 0.4 Hz regularly. Intracellular sodium activity (aiNa), potassium activity (aiK) and membrane potential (Em) were monitored with single barrel normal and ion-selective micro-electrodes. It was shown that aiNa rose definitely from the concentration of 30 nmol.L-1, and became more significant until the dose of 0.4 mumol.L-1. aiNa rose very much faster within the range of toxic doses (from 1-20 mumol.L-1 to 1 mmol.L-1). The occurrence time of delay afterdepolarization (DAD) after adding drugs varied with various drugs used, or with different experiments, hence the time points of DAD and delta aiNa-time, concentration relation curves were quite scattered. But when basing on the appearance of DAD as a common time point we calculated the temporal variation of aiNa before and after toxic effect, the relation curves in a same sort of glycoside were kept uniform. When the toxic effects of glycosides appeared, the inhibition degree of sodium pump activity was quite close (between 52.8% and 65.5%), suggesting that there existed close relationship between sodium pump inhibition and toxic effects of glycosides. Intracellular potassium ions lost progressly within the scope of subtoxic doses (10-30 nmol.L-1) and lost more significantly within the scope of toxic doses (1-20 mumol.L-1). Based on the results of calculation, the inward current induced by the sodium pump inhibition might be responsible for the abnormal automaticity.",M1
8171041,"Regulation of Na,K-ATPase by endogenous ouabain-like materials.Sodium, potassium-ATPase (NKA) is an essential energy transduction mechanism in which the free energy released by hydrolysis of ATP is transferred to an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane.

The search for endogenous mammalian counterparts of the cardiac glycosides, which regulate the activity of the enzyme by interacting from the extracellular surface at this receptor site, has moved ahead dramatically with evidence that ouabain is an endogenous product of the mammalian adrenal cortex.

The enzyme is composed of two subunits and serves as the receptor for cardiac <e>glycosides</e>. Utilizing an expression/selection system it has been possible to identify several amino acid residues that affect sensitivity to the cardiac glycoside, ouabain. Those identified to date are located in the first transmembrane region and first extracellular region. The fact that amino acid residues within a transmembrane region affect ouabain sensitivity suggests that the drug is partially internalized in the lipid bilayer. In an effort to determine whether any of the amino acid residues which affect ouabain sensitivity interact with the sugar part of cardiac glycosides, ouabain and ouabagenin were tested in terms of their ability to inhibit enzyme containing substitutions at these positions. The two compounds differ in that ouabagenin lacks a sugar moiety. Interestingly, the ratio of I50's for the substituted enzymes remains the same as the wild type, which suggests that the amino acids identified as determinants of ouabain sensitivity to date are not likely to interact with the sugar.

8226778,"Kinetic analysis of ouabain binding to native and mutated forms of Na,K-ATPase and identification of a new region involved in cardiac <e>glycoside</e> interactions.Cardiac glycosides inhibit the Na,K-ATPase by binding to the catalytic alpha subunit of the enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis of the H1-H2 domain has demonstrated the importance of this region in determining cardiac glycoside affinity. In this study, random mutagenesis was used to identify an amino acid, arginine 880, in the COOH-terminal portion of the alpha subunit which influences the sensitivity of the enzyme to ouabain. This residue is predicted to reside in the H7-H8 extracellular loop. Conversion of arginine 880 to a proline causes a 10-fold increase in the dissociation rate constant and a 2-fold increase in the association rate constant for [3H]ouabain binding. This results in an enzyme with a KD for ouabain 5-fold higher than the wild-type sheep alpha 1 isoform. These data are compatible with arginine 880 comprising a portion of the ouabain binding site. Furthermore, if arginine 880 is at the physical binding site, then this finding lends support to models that place this amino acid extracellularly since cardiac glycosides interact with the extracellular surface of the Na,K-ATPase. The ouabain binding characteristics of substitution R880P were compared with those of several different Na,K-ATPases, each of which contains a single amino acid substitution in the H1-H2 region of the alpha subunit. The substituted enzymes, C104A, Y108A, E116Q, P118K, and Y124F, vary considerably in their rates of dissociation (1-4-fold increase in the dissociation rate constant). In addition, the rate of association of [3H]ouabain binding to substitution P118K is 2-fold slower than that of the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that the H1-H2 domain may participate directly in ouabain binding as well as be involved in conformational changes, both of which could affect the sensitivity of the enzyme to ouabain.",M1

1472097,"A multispecific uptake system for taurocholate, cardiac <e>glycosides</e> and cationic drugs in the liver.To test the hypothesis of multiplicity in carrier-mediated uptake mechanisms for organic cations in the liver and to study the possible relation with bile acid and cardiac glycoside uptake mechanisms, mutual interaction during uptake of various radiolabeled quaternary amines has been studied in isolated rat hepatocytes. Inhibition patterns at low concentrations (1 microM) of the presumed type I monovalent organic cation tri-n-butylmethylammonium were markedly different from those at relatively high concentrations (25 microM). Both the cardiac glycoside K-strophantoside and the bile acid taurocholate clearly reduced the uptake rate of tri-n-butylmethylammonium at 25 microM whereas these agents completely failed to reduce the uptake at low concentrations of the cation. Subsequently, inhibition of uptake of some multivalent amphipathic organic cations (muscle relaxants) for the type II uptake system was investigated. It was found that the uptake of these muscle relaxants both at tracer concentrations (&lt; 1 microM) and at relatively high concentrations (25 microM) was decreased in the presence of low concentrations of the cardiac glycoside K-strophantoside, while taurocholate only inhibited the uptake at the concentration range &gt; 25 microM of the muscle relaxants. Procainamide ethobromide, a typical type I organic cation, did not affect the uptake either at the low or high concentration range of the muscle relaxants. It is concluded that for each of the type I-like compounds and type II-like compounds tested at least two systems are involved in uptake into hepatocytes: tri-n-butylmethylammonium in a concentration range &lt; or = 1 microM is mainly taken up by the type I uptake system and at concentrations &gt; or = 25 microM also by system(s) that can be inhibited by taurocholate and K-strophantoside. Bulky amphipathic organic (type II) cations at concentrations &lt; 1 microM are also transported by an uptake system that is inhibitable by cardiac glycosides but not by bile salts. At concentrations &gt; 25 microM these compounds are predominantly accommodated by an uptake system that possibly mediates uptake of both cardiac glycosides and bile acids. This concept was supported by the observation that both type II organic cations and bile salts can inhibit ouabain uptake, while type II organic cations as well as the cardiac glycosides reduce taurocholate uptake rate. The present data support the idea that the liver seems to be equipped with a  multispecific  uptake system that transports hydrophobic compounds irrespective of charge, including some type I and type II organic cations at relatively high substrate concentrations.",M1

It is possible to hypostatize that hesperidin, due to its rutinoside moiety, is located at the level of polar head whereas hesperetin interacts better with acyl chains and adopts a more planar conformation. The findings of this work may contribute to explain the high bioavailability of aglycones due to better membrane interaction.",M2

20355121,"Effects of the beta-glycosidase reaction on bio-conversion of isoflavones and quality during tofu processing.BACKGROUND: Isoflavones are the most common group of phytoestrogens which are present in significantly large amounts in soybean and soy products such as tofu. Isoflavones occur naturally in <e>glycoside</e> forms having lower bioavailability than their aglycone forms. beta-Glycosidase acts as a bio-catalyst for the conversion of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones, raising the bioavailability of isoflavones; therefore, it can be used to improve the quality of tofu. We need to establish process conditions for the optimal outcome of the enzyme reaction in tofu. RESULTS: By using the beta-glycosidase (0.02% w/v) reaction at 55 degrees C for 30 min, a maximum 84.5% conversion of isoflavone glycoside to isoflavone aglycone was obtained. The enzyme reaction caused no significant effects on the sensory acceptability of soft tofu. The hardness of enzyme-treated hard tofu increased with the coagulant amount whereas prolonged heating resulted in decrease of hardness. Incorporation of enzyme reaction before the coagulation process during soft tofu processing provided a sufficient bio-conversion of isoflavones at optimal conditions. CONCLUSION: beta-Glycosidase can be effectively used for the bioconversion of isoflavones in soft tofu manufacturing process at optimal reaction conditions before the onset of coagulation process.",M2

20201801,"Five years patenting time frame concerning enzymatic preparation of <e>glycosides</e>.Carbohydrates are important molecules in various technological fields. The regio- and stereoselective synthesis of oligosaccharides for food and pharmaceutical molecular design and the selective glycosylation of peptides, proteins and drugs, as well as the selective hydrolysis of natural abundant saccharidic materials affording low molecular weight high value- added products, can be all considered significant aspects. Advance in the chemical synthesis of glycosidic bond represents one of the most successful topic in organic synthetic chemistry in the last half century for the intrinsic difficulties chemists have to face dealing with carbohydrates: yields and selectivity. Biocatalytic strategies selected for high-yield and stereospecific construction of glycosidic bonds are based principally on the action of two classes of enzymes, namely glycoside hydrolases (endo- and exo-glycosidases) and glycosyltransferases although only enzymes of the second class are devoted to synthetic action in nature. Reviewing patents on the preparation of glycosides is hard to manage, here a five years time frame for this review is set, considering it a suitable compromise in terms of amount of innovation and numbers of patents to analyze. Interest of researchers for the natural sources of biocatalysts, with particular emphasis on modified enzymes and lists of the most innovative patents in cosmetic, fine chemicals and food fields will be commented. Biomolecular asset of selected patents related to glycosides will be expressly considered. Large number of enzymes will be required in future in order to realize more sustainable new enzymatic processes to answer human needs.",M2
20188057,"Development and application of a screening assay for <e>glycoside</e> phosphorylases.Glycoside phosphorylases (GPs) are interesting enzymes for the glycosylation of chemical molecules. They require only a glycosyl phosphate as sugar donor and an acceptor molecule with a free hydroxyl group. Their narrow substrate specificity, however, limits the application of GPs for general glycoside synthesis. Although an enzyme's substrate specificity can be altered and broadened by protein engineering and directed evolution, this requires a suitable screening assay. Such a screening assay has not yet been described for GPs. Here we report a screening procedure for GPs based on the measurement of released inorganic phosphate in the direction of glycoside synthesis. It appeared necessary to inhibit endogenous phosphatase activity in crude Escherichia coli cell extracts with molybdate, and inorganic phosphate was measured with a modified phosphomolybdate method. The screening system is general and can be used to screen GP enzyme libraries for novel donor and acceptor specificities. It was successfully applied to screen a residue E649 saturation mutagenesis library of Cellulomonas uda cellobiose phosphorylase (CP) for novel acceptor specificity. An E649C enzyme variant was found with novel acceptor specificity toward alkyl beta-glucosides and phenyl beta-glucoside.

20157237,"A flavonol <e>glycoside</e>, isolated from roots of Panax notoginseng, reduces amyloid-beta-induced neurotoxicity in cultured neurons: signaling transduction and drug development for Alzheimer's disease.A Radix Notoginseng flavonol glycoside (RNFG), quercetin 3-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, was isolated from roots of Panax notoginseng. Among different biological properties tested, RNFG possessed a strong activity in preventing amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced cell death. In an in vitro assay, RNFG inhibited the aggregation of Abeta in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, application of RNFG in cultured cortical neurons, or PC12 cells, reduced the Abeta-induced cell death in time- and dose-dependent manners, with the suppression of Abeta-induced DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation. In cultured neurons, the pre-treatment of RNFG abolished the increase of Ca(2+) mobilization triggered by Abeta. The neuroprotective properties of RNFG required a specific sugar attachment within the main chemical backbone because the flavonol backbone by itself did not show any protective effect. In memory impairment experiments using the passive avoidance task, the administration of RNFG reduced brain damage in scopolamine-treated rats. These results therefore reveal a novel function of Radix Notoginseng and its flavonol glycoside that could be very useful in developing food supplements for the prevention, or potential treatment, of Alzheimer's disease.",M2

Spices generally used to increase the taste and flavor of food also has the history of usage as an ayurvedic medicine. Therefore to explore the health modulating effects of Cuminum cyminum and to identify the active compound, immunomodulatory properties were evaluated using flowcytometry and ELISA in normal and immune-suppressed animals. C. cyminum and compound 1 stimulated the T cells and Th1 cytokines expression in normal animals. Swiss albino mice subjected to Cyclosporine-A induced immune-suppression were dosed orally with C. cyminum (25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) on consecutive days. The results showed that administration significantly increased T cells (CD4 and CD8) count and Th1 predominant immune response in a dose dependent manner thereby suggesting immunomodulatory activity through modulation of T lymphocytes expression. In restraint stress induced immune-suppressed animals, compound 1 countered the depleted T lymphocytes, decreased the elevated corticosterone levels and size of adrenal glands and increased the weight of thymus and spleen.

20024121,"Assessing the cluster <e>glycoside</e> effect during the binding of concanavalin A to mannosylated artificial lipid rafts.Mannosyl glycolipids with perfluoroalkyl membrane anchors have been synthesised. When inserted into vesicles, these mannosyl lipids either dispersed evenly over the surface or, in the presence of cholesterol, phase-separated into artificial lipid rafts. At 1% mol/mol, the affinity of dispersed mannosyl lipids for Con A was 3-fold weaker than in solution, perhaps reflecting steric blocking by the surface. However increasing membrane loading 5-fold increased Con A affinity by up to 75% and indicated weak intramembrane chelation of Con A. Despite this observation, concentrating the mannosyl lipids into artificial lipid rafts did not significantly improve affinity for Con A. This lack of a cluster glycoside effect was ascribed to lipid congestion inhibiting intra-raft chelation of Con A, and implies that glycolipids located in lipid rafts may not necessarily be preorganised for multivalent binding.",M2
20024120,"Mechanism of <e>glycoside</e> hydrolysis: A comparative QM/MM molecular dynamics analysis for wild type and Y69F mutant retaining xylanases.Computational simulations have been performed using hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical potentials to investigate the catalytic mechanism of the retaining endo-beta-1, 4-xylanase (BCX) from B. circulans. Two-dimensional potential-of-mean-force calculations based upon molecular dynamics with the AM1/OPLS method for wild-type BCX with a p-nitrophenyl xylobioside substrate in water clearly indicates a stepwise mechanism for glycosylation: the rate-determining step is nucleophilic substitution by Glu78 to form the covalently bonded enzyme-substrate intermediate without protonation of the leaving group by Glu172. The geometrical configuration of the transition state for the enzymic reaction is essentially the same as found for a gas-phase model involving only the substrate and a propionate/propionic acid pair to represent the catalytic glutamate/glutamic acid groups. In addition to stabilizing the (2,5)B boat conformation of the proximal xylose in the non-covalent reactant complex of the substrate with BCX, Tyr69 lowers the free-energy barrier for glycosylation by 42 kJ mol(-1) relative to that calculated for the Y69F mutant, which lacks the oxygen atom O(Y). B3LYP/6-31+G* energy corrections reduce the absolute height of the barrier to reaction. In the oxacarbenium ion-like transition state O(Y) approaches closer to the endocyclic oxygen O(ring) of the sugar ring but donates its hydrogen bond not to O(ring) but rather to the nucleophilic oxygen of Glu78. Comparison of the average atomic charge distributions for the wild-type and mutant indicates that charge separation along the bond between the anomeric carbon and O(ring) is matched in the former by a complementary separation of charge along the O(Y)-H(Y) bond, corresponding to a pair of roughly antiparallel bond dipoles, which is not present in the latter.",M2

In this paper we compared the inhibitory effects of various <e>glycosides</e> in which various hydrophobic aglycons were attached to D-GalNAc(4SO4) via ss anomeric configuration. p-Nitrophenyl-beta-D-GalNAc(4SO4) and p-chlorophenyl-beta-D-GalNAc(4SO4) were stronger inhibitors than phenyl-beta-D-GalNAc(4SO4). Among inhibitors examined here, 3-estradiol-beta-D-GalNAc(4SO4) was the strongest inhibitor; the Ki of 3-estradiol-beta-D-GalNAc(4SO4) for the competitive inhibition was 0.008 mM, which was much lower than the Ki of phenyl-beta-D-GalNAc(4SO4), 0.98 mM. In contrast, 7-estradiol-beta-D-GalNAc(4SO4) showed only weak inhibition to GalNAc4S-6ST. 3-Estradiol-beta-D-GalNAc(4SO4) did not inhibit chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase and chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase under the concentration where GalNAc4S-6ST was inhibited by 90%. When 3-estradiol-beta-D-GalNAc(4SO4) was added to the culture medium of chondrosarcoma cells expressing human GalNAc4S-6ST, a significant, albeit small, reduction in the cellular synthesis of CS-E was observed. These results suggest that estradiol group of 3-estradiol-beta-D-GalNAc(4SO4) may enhance the inhibitory activity of the glycoside through increasing the affinity to the enzyme and may allow the glycosides to diffuse at a low efficiency into the cells to inhibit cellular synthesis of CS-E.",M2

19959572,"Carotenoids of Gemmatimonas aurantiaca (Gemmatimonadetes): identification of a novel carotenoid, deoxyoscillol 2-rhamnoside, and proposed biosynthetic pathway of oscillol 2,2'-dirhamnoside.Gemmatimonas aurantiaca strain T-27(T) is an orange-coloured, Gram-negative, facultatively aerobic, polyphosphate-accumulating bacterium belonging to a recently proposed phylum, Gemmatimonadetes. We purified its pigments and identified them as carotenoids and their <e>glycoside</e> derivatives using spectral data. The major carotenoid was (2S,2' S)-oscillol 2,2'-di-(alpha-l-rhamnoside), and the minor carotenoids were (2S)-deoxyoscillol 2-( alpha-l-rhamnoside) and didemethylspirilloxanthin. Deoxyoscillol 2-rhamnoside is a novel carotenoid. Oscillol 2,2'-diglycosides have hitherto only been reported in a limited number of cyanobacteria, and this is believed to be the first finding of such carotenoids in another bacterial phylum. Based on the identification of the carotenoids and the completion of the entire nucleotide sequence, we propose a biosynthetic pathway for the carotenoids and the corresponding genes and enzymes. We propose the involvement of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (CrtE), phytoene synthase (CrtB) and phytoene desaturase (CrtI) for lycopene synthesis; and of carotenoid 1,2-hydratase (CruF) and carotenoid 2-O-rhamnosyltransferase (CruG) for oscillol 2,2'-dirhamnoside synthesis. Further, isopentenyl pyrophosphate could be synthesized by a non-mevalonate pathway (DXP pathway).",M2

19933203,"Members of the LBD family of transcription factors repress anthocyanin synthesis and affect additional nitrogen responses in Arabidopsis.Nitrogen (N) and nitrate (NO(3)(-)) per se regulate many aspects of plant metabolism, growth, and development. N/NO(3)(-) also suppresses parts of secondary metabolism, including anthocyanin synthesis. Molecular components for this repression are unknown. We report that three N/NO(3)(-)-induced members of the LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY DOMAIN (LBD) gene family of transcription factors (LBD37, LBD38, and LBD39) act as negative regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Overexpression of each of the three genes in the absence of N/NO(3)(-) strongly suppresses the key regulators of anthocyanin synthesis PAP1 and PAP2, genes in the anthocyanin-specific part of flavonoid synthesis, as well as cyanidin- but not quercetin- or kaempferol-<e>glycoside</e> production. Conversely, lbd37, lbd38, or lbd39 mutants accumulate anthocyanins when grown in N/NO(3)(-)-sufficient conditions and show constitutive expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. The LBD genes also repress many other known N-responsive genes, including key genes required for NO(3)(-) uptake and assimilation, resulting in altered NO(3)(-) content, nitrate reductase activity/activation, protein, amino acid, and starch levels, and N-related growth phenotypes. The results identify LBD37 and its two close homologs as novel repressors of anthocyanin biosynthesis and N availability signals in general. They also show that, besides being developmental regulators, LBD genes fulfill roles in metabolic regulation.",M2

19846069,"Macoma birmanica agglutinin recognizes <e>glycoside</e> clusters of beta-GlcNAc/Glc and alpha-Man.Macoma birmanica agglutinin (MBA) that seems to play crucial roles in the innate immunity of marine bivalve, M. birmanica has been earlier defined as GlcNAc/Man specific. However, most complementary carbohydrate structures to its binding domain and ligand clustering in its recognition profile have not been established. In this study, the complete recognition profile of MBA was examined by enzyme-linked lectin-sorbent assay and inhibition assay. Among the monosaccharides tested, GlcNAc was more reactive followed by Man and Glc, others were non-reactive; revealing the importance of equatorial -NAc group at C-2, -OH group at C-4 and C-6, and pyranose conformation of hexose. Moreover, beta-glycosides of GlcNAc and Glc were more potent whereas for Man it was alpha-glycoside. MBA recognized both exposed and internal alpha-Man and beta-GlcNAc/Glc residues well with most linkages except (beta1-4). This binding pattern was further extended and confirmed by polyvalent glycoside clusters of GlcNAc(beta1-2)Man(alpha1-, which was a better inhibitor than Man(alpha1-2/3/6)Man(alpha1- or Man(alpha1-3/6)Man(beta1- present in well-defined naturally occurring glycoproteins.

19836522,"An approach to identifying sequential metabolites of a typical phenylethanoid <e>glycoside</e>, echinacoside, based on liquid chromatography-ion trap-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis.Metabolite identification for the compounds that undergo multiple and sequential metabolism is still a great challenge. Echinacoside (ECH), a typical phenylethanoid glycoside, contains multiple unstable chemical bonds and high reactive functional groups which are susceptible to multiple pathways of degradation and metabolism, leading great difficulties for its metabolite identification. This study proposed a novel approach for rapidly identifying the complicated and unpredictable metabolites of ECH, based on the powerful liquid chromatography hybrid ion trap and time of flight mass spectrometry (LC/MS-IT-TOF) analysis. Four degradation products were rapidly identified via the  fragmentation-degradation  comparisons. Five phase I and phase II metabolites of the degradation products were rapidly characterized via the crossover mass differences comparisons of their quasi-molecular ions with the potential precursors. Four direct phase I and phase II metabolites of the parent compound were identified by the mass differences analysis of the molecular ions between metabolites and the parent compound. Multiple stages of fragmentation patterns were used to confirm the metabolites characterizations. This study provides a novel approach to characterizing the complicated metabolites, and would be widely applicable for the metabolite identification of natural products.",M2

19816047,"Multi-<e>glycoside</e> of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f. ameliorates prolonged mesangial lesions in experimental progressive glomerulonephritis.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Multi-glycoside from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f. (GTW) is used for treatment of progressive glomerulonephritis (GN) in China. We have previously reported the beneficial effects of GTW on acute GN induced by an anti-Thy-1.1 monoclonal antibody (mAb). In the present study, the effect and potential mechanisms of GTW on the chronic irreversible model of GN were investigated. METHODS: Progressive GN was induced in rats by two intravenous injections of anti-Thy-1.1 mAb 1-22-3. Daily oral administration of GTW was started before the second injection of mAb until the day of sacrifice. Ten rats were randomly divided into a control (vehicle-treated) and a GTW-treated group, and sacrificed on day 45 after the first injection of mAb 1-22-3. Proteinuria was determined on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45. Blood biochemical parameters, morphological changes of mesangium, glomerular infiltration of macrophage and T lymphocyte, and glomerular mRNA expression of cytokines (TGF-beta, IL-2, and IFN-gamma) were examined from the samples taken at terminal sacrifice. RESULTS: GTW treatment significantly ameliorated proteinuria, renal function, prolonged mesangial lesions and inflammatory cell accumulation in glomerulus. In addition, it significantly reduced the glomerular mRNA expression for TGF-beta, IL-2, and IFN-gamma. CONCLUSION: GTW ameliorates prolonged glomerular lesions presumably through suppression of cytokine production (TGF-beta, IL-2, and IFN-gamma). GTW could be an effective therapeutic agent for treatment of chronic renal diseases.",M2

19783642,"A real-time fluorogenic assay for the visualization of <e>glycoside</e> hydrolase activity in planta.There currently exists a diverse array of molecular probes for the in situ localization of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins in plant cells, including reporter enzyme strategies (e.g. protein-glucuronidase fusions). In contrast, however, there is a paucity of methods for the direct analysis of endogenous glycoside hydrolases and transglycosidases responsible for cell wall remodeling. To exemplify the potential of fluorogenic resorufin glycosides to address this issue, a resorufin beta-glycoside of a xylogluco-oligosaccharide (XXXG-beta-Res) was synthesized as a specific substrate for in planta analysis of XEH activity. The resorufin aglycone is particularly distinguished for high sensitivity in muro assays due to a low pK(a) (5.8) and large extinction coefficient (epsilon 62,000 M(-1) cm(-1)), long-wavelength fluorescence (excitation 571 nm/emission 585 nm), and high quantum yield (0.74) of the corresponding anion. In vitro analyses demonstrated that XXXG-beta-Res is hydrolyzed by the archetypal plant XEH, nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) NXG1, with classical Michaelis-Menten substrate saturation kinetics and a linear dependence on both enzyme concentration and incubation time. Further, XEH activity could be visualized in real time by observing the localized increase in fluorescence in germinating nasturtium seeds and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) inflorescent stems by confocal microscopy. Importantly, this new in situ XEH assay provides an essential complement to the in situ xyloglucan endotransglycosylase assay, thus allowing delineation of the disparate activities encoded by xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase genes directly in plant tissues. The observation that XXXG-beta-Res is also hydrolyzed by diverse microbial XEHs indicates that this substrate, and resorufin glycosides in general, may find broad applicability for the analysis of wall restructuring by polysaccharide hydrolases during morphogenesis and plant-microbe interactions.",M2
19778371,"Growth and nutritive value of cassava (Manihot esculenta Cranz.) are reduced when grown in elevated CO.Global food security in a changing climate depends on both the nutritive value of staple crops as well as their yields. Here, we examined the direct effect of atmospheric CO(2) on cassava (Manihot esculenta Cranz., manioc), a staple for 750 million people worldwide. Cassava is poor in nutrients and contains high levels of cyanogenic <e>glycosides</e> that break down to release toxic hydrogen cyanide when damaged. We grew cassava at three concentrations of CO(2) (C(a): 360, 550 and 710 ppm) supplied together with nutrient solution containing either 1 mM or 12 mM nitrogen. We found that total plant biomass and tuber yield (number and mass) decreased linearly with increasing C(a). In the worst-case scenario, tuber mass was reduced by an order of magnitude in plants grown at 710 ppm compared with 360 ppm CO(2). Photosynthetic parameters were consistent with the whole plant biomass data. It is proposed that since cassava stomata are highly sensitive to other environmental variables, the decrease in assimilation observed here might, in part, be a direct effect of CO(2) on stomata. Total N (used here as a proxy for protein content) and cyanogenic glycoside concentrations of the tubers were not significantly different in the plants grown at elevated CO(2). By contrast, the concentration of cyanogenic glycosides in the edible leaves nearly doubled in the highest C(a). If leaves continue to be used as a protein supplement, they will need to be more thoroughly processed in the future. With increasing population density, declining soil fertility, expansion into marginal farmland, together with the predicted increase in extreme climatic events, reliance on robust crops such as cassava will increase. The responses to CO(2) shown here point to the possibility that there could be severe food shortages in the coming decades unless CO(2) emissions are dramatically reduced, or alternative cultivars or crops are developed.",M2

To investigate the relationship between substrate specificity and amino acid sequence similarity in family GH1 glycoside hydrolases, Os3BGlu8 and Os7BGlu26, putative rice beta-D-glucosidases from this cluster, and a beta-D-mannosidase from barley (rHvBII), were expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized.

All the enzymes hydrolyzed cellooligosaccharides with increased hydrolytic rates as the degree of polymerization increased from 3-6, but only rHvBII hydrolyzed cellobiose with a higher k(cat)/K(m) value than cellotriose. This was primarily due to strong binding of glucosyl residues at the+2 subsite for the rice enzymes, and unfavorable interactions at this subsite with rHvBII.",M2

To evaluate any preventive effect, GRRK was administered 1h (hour) before each OVA-sensitization and challenge, while to analyze the curative effect, mice were first sensitized with OVA, followed by GRRK given at day 18 through 21. The onset of AAD was evaluated 24h after the last OVA challenge. Both treatments resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in total leukocyte and eosinophil counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL). GRRK also decreased CD4(+), B220(+), MHC class II and CD40 molecule expressions in BAL cells. Histology and lung mechanic showed that GRRK suppressed mucus production and ameliorated the AHR induced by OVA challenge. Furthermore, GRRK impaired Th2 cytokine production (IL-5 and IL-13) and did not induce a Th1 pattern of inflammation. These findings demonstrate that GRRK treatment before or after established allergic lung disease down-regulates key asthmatic features. Therefore, GRRK has a potential clinical use for the treatment of allergic asthma.",M2
19735189,"Phytochemical composition and antioxidant activity of Laurus nobilis L. leaf infusion.Laurus nobilis L. (laurel) leaves are frequently used as a spice for cooking purposes. Folk medicine in many countries uses the infusion of the plant in stomachic and carminative remedies, as well as for the treatment of gastric diseases. Little information is available about the phytochemical composition of the infusion of dried leaves, which is a way to consume this aromatic and medicinal plant. Phytochemical investigations on the infusion were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a diode array detector (DAD) and direct electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Several flavonoid derivatives were detected. Semipreparative HPLC from the infusion of laurel leaves isolated 10 flavonoid O-<e>glycosides</e>, one flavonoid C-glycoside, catechin, and cinnamtannin B1. Structures of the isolated compounds were computed on the basis of spectral measurements including high-resolution mass spectrometry spectroscopy and one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The amount of the flavonoids was also determined by HPLC-DAD. The antioxidant activity of the tea and the isolated compounds was also measured using two different in vitro methods: the Briggs-Rauscher oscillating reaction test, at a pH similar to that of the gastric juice, and the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay, at the pH of blood. For the infusion and the methanol extract the total phenolic content was also measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent.",M2
19733839,"Twisting of glycosidic bonds by hydrolases.Patterns of scissile bond twisting have been found in crystal structures of <e>glycoside</e> hydrolases (GHs) that are complexed with substrates and inhibitors. To estimate the increased potential energy in the substrates that results from this twisting, we have plotted torsion angles for the scissile bonds on hybrid Quantum Mechanics::Molecular Mechanics energy surfaces. Eight such maps were constructed, including one for alpha-maltose and three for different forms of methyl alpha-acarviosinide to provide energies for twisting of alpha-(1,4) glycosidic bonds. Maps were also made for beta-thiocellobiose and for three beta-cellobiose conformers having different glycon ring shapes to model distortions of beta-(1,4) glycosidic bonds. Different GH families twist scissile glycosidic bonds differently, increasing their potential energies from 0.5 to 9.5 kcal/mol. In general, the direction of twisting of the glycosidic bond away from the conformation of lowest intramolecular energy correlates with the position (syn or anti) of the proton donor with respect to the glycon's ring oxygen atom. This correlation suggests that glycosidic bond distortion is important for the optimal orientation of one of the glycosidic oxygen lone pairs toward the enzyme's proton donor.",M2

19715310,"Probing synergy between two catalytic strategies in the <e>glycoside</e> hydrolase O-GlcNAcase using multiple linear free energy relationships.Human O-GlcNAcase plays an important role in regulating the post-translational modification of serine and threonine residues with beta-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine monosaccharide unit (O-GlcNAc). The mechanism of O-GlcNAcase involves nucleophilic participation of the 2-acetamido group of the substrate to displace a glycosidically linked leaving group. The tolerance of this enzyme for variation in substrate structure has enabled us to characterize O-GlcNAcase transition states using several series of substrates to generate multiple simultaneous free-energy relationships. Patterns revealing changes in mechanism, transition state, and rate-determining step upon concomitant variation of both nucleophilic strength and leaving group abilities are observed. The observed changes in mechanism reflect the roles played by the enzymic general acid and the catalytic nucleophile. Significantly, these results illustrate how the enzyme synergistically harnesses both modes of catalysis; a feature that eludes many small molecule models of catalysis. These studies also suggest the kinetic significance of an oxocarbenium ion intermediate in the O-GlcNAcase-catalyzed hydrolysis of glucosaminides, probing the limits of what may be learned using nonatomistic investigations of enzymic transition-state structure and offering general insights into how the superfamily of retaining glycoside hydrolases act as efficient catalysts.",M2

In the present report, one <e>glycoside</e> from the methanol extract of Picrorhiza scrophulariiflora, scrocaffeside A, shows immunomodulatory properties by structure. So we measured various indicators of mammalian immune cells to test its immunostimulation potential. The scrocaffeside A enhanced proliferation of splenocytes and their response to polyclonal T cell mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). There was also a significant increase in the activity of peritoneal macrophages and natural killer cell when treated with doses of scrocaffeside A between 5 microg/ml and 125 microg/ml. A dose-dependent increase was also observed in the populations of mature T cell subsets. The production of cytokines and the CD4/CD8 population of splenocytes were also elevated. The levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-12, and (IFN)-gamma expressed by cultured splenocytes were significantly increased when the cells were exposed to scrocaffeside A. These results indicate that scrocaffeside A may exert immunoenhancement effects on immune system.

Uptake by B16 cells was first observed for all carba-<e>glycoside</e> primers, and, especially, the 5a-carba-sugar analogues of N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminide 1b and beta-d-glucoside 1d were shown to produce two-to-four-fold larger amounts of glycosylated products than the corresponding true sugar primers 1a and 1c. The carba glycoside uptake by cells resulted in beta-galactosylation and subsequent sialylation of the incorporated galactose residues, giving rise to glycosylated products 3b and 3d having similar glycan structures as the ganglioside GM3. According to efficient uptake in cells, in addition to stability of the ether-linked pseudo-reducing ends of the oligosaccharides that formed, the carba glycoside primers have been demonstrated to be versatile building blocks for these biocombinatorial syntheses of glycolipid oligosaccharide mimetics.

19629957,"O-<e>glycoside</e> sequence of pentacyclic triterpene saponins from Phytolacca bogotensis using HPLC-ESI/multi-stage tandem mass spectrometry.INTRODUCTION: The lack of pharmacopoeial methodologies for the quality control of plants used for therapeutic purposes is a huge problem that impacts directly upon public health. In the case of saponins, their great structural complexity, weak glycoside bonds and high polarity hinder their identification by conventional techniques. OBJECTIVE: To apply high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI/MS(n)) to identify the O-glycoside sequence of saponins from the roots of Phytolacca bogotensis. METHODOLOGY: Saponins were isolated by preparative HPLC and characterised by NMR spectroscopic experiments. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of isolated saponins was performed producing typical degradation reactions that can be associated with several glycosidic bonds as empirical criteria. A method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and HPLC/ESI-MS(n) for the characterisation of saponins and identification of novel molecules is described. RESULTS: Three saponins reported for the first time in P. bogotensis were isolated and characterised by NMR spectroscopy. Characteristic cross ring cleavage reactions have been used as empirical criteria for the characterisation of the glycosidic bonds most frequently reported for Phytolacca saponins. One new saponin was proposed on the basis of empirical criteria, and other five saponins were identified for the first time for P. bogotensis using HPLC-ESI/MS(n). CONCLUSION: Electrospray ionisation in combination with tandem mass spectrometry has been established as a powerful tool for the profiling of saponins from roots of P. bogotensis. CID proved to be a useful tool for the characterisation and identification of known and novel saponins from the plant family Phytolaccaceae and can be used for quality control purposes of crude plant extracts.",M2

Deviation from standard rules in modern medicines, where instead of a single isolated fraction, a group of naturally occurring components exerts the desired therapeutic effect, was noted in case of Picroliv or Kutkin of Picrorhiza kurroa.  Picroliv  mainly a glucoside, is one such compound, normally obtained from 3 - 4 years old roots and rhizomes of an endangered medicinal plant - Picrorhiza kurroa (kutki) and constitute an important component of many Indian herbal preparations, used mainly for the treatment of a variety of liver ailments.

The aglycone portion, the glycosylation position, the order of sugars and the identity of sugars of each glycoside were unambiguously identified. The new strategy--identifying the partial structure of a molecule by comparison with a different compound possessing the same assumed partial structure--is quite effective for structure identification of the aglycone of 1-4; the unusual non-radical [Y(0)-H-CH(2)](-) ion observed for the methoxylated flavonoid glycoside 8 is quite useful for structure elucidation of the aglycone of 5-8; the UV data obtained on-line with post-column addition of UV-shift reagents are powerful for determination of the glycosylation and methoxylation positions for each flavone glycoside. Finally, isolation and subsequent individual analysis by NMR were performed to provide complementary information for the configurations of each sugar and the linkage types of each disaccharide. Thus, the structures of the eight detected flavone glycosides, which all have never been reported in D. tanguticum before, were positively identified.",M2

Here, a method for extension of the carbohydrate group of commercially available dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside (DDM) is presented. DDM was converted to dodecyl-beta-d-maltooctaoside (DDMO) in a single step by using a CGTase as catalyst and alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) as glycosyl donor. The coupling reaction is under kinetic control and the maximum yield depends on the selectivity of the enzyme. The Bacillus macerans CGTase favored the coupling reaction while the Thermoanaerobacter enzyme also catalyzed disproportionation reactions leading to a broader product range. A high ratio alpha-CD/DDM favored a high yield of DDMO and yields up to 80% were obtained using the B. macerans enzyme as catalyst.",M2

We show that the active center is extremely similar to those from glycoside hydrolase families GH18, GH20, GH56, GH84, and GH85 implying that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, GH25 enzymes also act with net retention of anomeric configuration using the neighboring-group catalytic mechanism that is common to this 'super-family' of enzymes.",M2
19587102,"Structural and enzymatic characterization of Os3BGlu6, a rice beta-glucosidase hydrolyzing hydrophobic <e>glycosides</e> and (1-&gt;3)- and (1-&gt;2)-linked disaccharides.Glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1) beta-glucosidases play roles in many processes in plants, such as chemical defense, alkaloid metabolism, hydrolysis of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides, phytohormone regulation, and lignification. However, the functions of most of the 34 GH1 gene products in rice (Oryza sativa) are unknown. Os3BGlu6, a rice beta-glucosidase representing a previously uncharacterized phylogenetic cluster of GH1, was produced in recombinant Escherichia coli. Os3BGlu6 hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-beta-d-fucoside (k(cat)/K(m) = 67 mm(-1) s(-1)), pNP-beta-d-glucoside (k(cat)/K(m) = 6.2 mm(-1) s(-1)), and pNP-beta-d-galactoside (k(cat)/K(m) = 1.6 mm(-1)s(-1)) efficiently but had little activity toward other pNP glycosides. It also had high activity toward n-octyl-beta-d-glucoside and beta-(1--&gt;3)- and beta-(1--&gt;2)-linked disaccharides and was able to hydrolyze apigenin beta-glucoside and several other natural glycosides. Crystal structures of Os3BGlu6 and its complexes with a covalent intermediate, 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucoside, and a nonhydrolyzable substrate analog, n-octyl-beta-d-thioglucopyranoside, were solved at 1.83, 1.81, and 1.80 A resolution, respectively. The position of the covalently trapped 2-F-glucosyl residue in the enzyme was similar to that in a 2-F-glucosyl intermediate complex of Os3BGlu7 (rice BGlu1). The side chain of methionine-251 in the mouth of the active site appeared to block the binding of extended beta-(1--&gt;4)-linked oligosaccharides and interact with the hydrophobic aglycone of n-octyl-beta-d-thioglucopyranoside. This correlates with the preference of Os3BGlu6 for short oligosaccharides and hydrophobic glycosides.",M2
19572651,"Quantitation of chafurosides A and B in tea leaves and isolation of prechafurosides A and B from oolong tea leaves.A procedure was developed for the quantitative determination of chafuroside A, a flavone C-<e>glycoside</e> with potent anti-inflammatory activity, and its regioisomer chafuroside B, as well as isovitexin and vitexin, by selected reaction monitoring liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SRM LC-MS/MS) analysis. This method was successfully applied to commercial leaves of green tea, houji tea, oolong tea, and black tea. High levels of chafurosides A and B were found in oolong tea leaves that had been heated at &gt;140 degrees C. Next, their precursors, prechafurosides A and B, were isolated from methanol extract of oolong tea leaves prepared from Shizu 7132, Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze, by partition with n-butanol and H2O and chromatography on Diaion SP-825, Sephadex LH-20, and ODS C-18, guided by assay of chafuroside formation. Prechafurosides A and B gave chafurosides A and B, respectively, in good yields when heated at 160 degrees C for 0.5 h. Solvolysis of prechafurosides A and B with pyridine and dioxane quantitatively afforded isovitexin and vitexin, respectively. On the basis of these results and physicochemical data (MS, UV, and NMR), prechafurosides A and B were concluded to be new flavone C-glycoside sulfates, isovitexin-2''-sulfate and vitexin-2''-sulfate, respectively.",M2

19551733,"Stemucronatoside L, a pregnane <e>glycoside</e> from the roots of Stephanotis mucronata, inhibits Th1/Th2 immune responses in vitro.Stemucronatoside L (SML), isolated from Stephanotis mucronata, could suppress the activation of T cells in vitro. However, the mechanisms responsible for its immunosuppressive activity remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether SML could suppress Th1/Th2 immune responses and to characterize the cellular mechanisms involved. Effects of SML on T-lymphocyte subsets and the production of Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-gamma, and Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 from ConA-stimulated mice splenocytes were detected by flow-cytometric analysis and ELISA method, respectively. Furthermore, effects of SML on mRNA expression level of Th1/Th2 cytokines and transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3 were evaluated by RT-PCR analysis. SML not only significantly decreased the percentage of CD4(+) T cells and the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, but reduced the production of Th1/Th2 cytokines in a concentration-dependent manner. The mRNA expression levels of Th1/Th2 cytokines and transcription factors (T-bet and GATA-3) were also suppressed by SML. These results suggested that SML could simultaneously inhibit Th1/Th2 immune responses by suppressing gene expression of Th1/Th2 cytokines and transcription factors.",M2

19521842,"Protocol for in vitro regeneration and marker <e>glycoside</e> assessment in Swertia chirata Buch-Ham.We have developed a rapid in vitro propagation system, via axillary shoot formation from nodal explants of Swertia chirata Buch Ham. Culture medium supplemented with 2 mg/L. BAP is best for direct shoot regeneration initially formed adventitious buds from axils of the nodal explants after 30 days. The reduced BAP concentration 0.5 mg/L proliferate shoots effectively. Kept the number of hyperhydrated shoots to minimal and induced on an average 22-38 shoots per flask (4.3 cm average length). The regenerated shoots (5- to 6-m long) formed roots very well in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium devoid of any growth regulator and followed by acclimatization of plants in pre-sterilized sand containing 1% Trichoderma viride and Azatobactor chrococcum as bioinoculants. The regenerated plants don't show any genomic alterations. This protocol also outlines procedure of assessment of marker iridoid glycosides (amarogentin and amaroswerin) from callus, roots, multiple shoots, regenerated plants, and mother plant. High propagation frequency, reproducibility of procedure, molecular, and phenotypic and chemical stability ensures the efficiency of the developed protocol.",M2
