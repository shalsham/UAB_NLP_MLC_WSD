20482925,"[<e>Polymyalgia rheumatica</e>: new possibilities for treatment, but not diagnosis]Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disorder, which predominantly occurs in patients aged 50 years and older. It can be difficult to differentiate PMR from other diseases, for general practitioners as well as for rheumatologists. Arteritis temporalis should not be overlooked in these patients, since missing this diagnosis may lead to irreversible visual loss. The majority of patients in whom PMR is suspected respond well to treatment with prednisone 15 mg per day. Methotrexate is an attractive alternative in patients who do not respond to prednisone or who experience side-effects due to prednisone.",M1
20447103,"Ophthalmic presentation of Wegener's granulomatosis on a background of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>.We present a case of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) in a 79-year-old man with limbitis and granulomatous conjunctivitis, on a background of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). The undifferentiated nature of ocular presentations of WG can be diagnostically challenging, especially in cases, such as this, where findings are initially inconclusive and evolve with time. This case highlights the significance of a history of PMR in patients with ocular inflammation. The systemic inflammatory systems of WG, including arthralgias, may mimic other conditions such as PMR. Patients with undifferentiated ocular inflammatory syndromes should be questioned regarding arthralgias, myalgias and stiffness. Such symptoms, or a background of PMR, should raise suspicion of WG.",M1
20398023,"Changes in adiponectin and leptin concentrations during glucocorticoid treatment: a pilot study in patients with <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>.This study is concerned with an evaluation of the effects of glucocorticoids (GC) on adiponectin and leptin concentrations in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Seven patients diagnosed with PMR were studied at baseline and after one and three months of prednisone treatment. Serum leptin and adiponectin, serum glucose and insulin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and IL-6 were all measured by commercial assays. The treatment with GC normalized inflammation markers and significantly increased adiponectin and leptin concentrations without any impairment of insulin sensitivity measured by HOMA-IR. Adiponectin significantly increased only between baseline and 1 month (P= 0.013). A significant correlation was found between adiponectin and leptin concentrations both at baseline and after 3 months of treatment (both rho = 0.89, P= 0.03). In addition, adiponectin correlated also with serum glucose at baseline (rho = 0.81, P= 0.047). According to our results, adiponectin concentrations seem to be driven by inflammation, whereas leptin seems to be increased directly by the use of steroids.",M1
20367535,"Medical management of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>.IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a relatively frequent condition in individuals older than 50 who originate from Western countries. Corticosteroids constitute the cornerstone therapy in the management of patients with PMR. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review summarizes the current literature on clinical clues for the diagnosis of PMR, conditions mimicking PMR, relapses in the setting of PMR and the main therapeutic strategies. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: With this information, the reader receives an overview on the current available data on clinical diagnosis and treatment options in PMR. TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: An initial dose of prednisone of 10-20 mg/day yields clinical improvement in the majority of patients with PMR. This is generally achieved within 7 days of the onset of this therapy. Conditions different from isolated PMR should be considered in atypical cases or when a good response to 20 mg/day of prednisone is not achieved. Relapses of PMR are not uncommon when the dose of prednisone is equal to or below than 5 mg/day. Methotrexate is the most commonly used corticosteroid sparing agent. Osteoporosis prophylaxis is also recommended.",M1
20198931,"Diagnosing joint pain in the older people.There are many potential causes of joint pain in older patients. The most likely aetiology is OA. However, the differential diagnosis includes conditions which should not be missed such as septic arthritis and inflammatory disease. The pattern of joint involvement points to the diagnosis. Bilateral symmetrical small joint pain, swelling and stiffness should arouse the suspicion of RA. The wrist and knee are commonly affected by pseudogout and the first metatarsophalangeal joint or knee joint involvement may represent gout. Stiffness in the shoulder and hip girdles, worse in the morning, suggests <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>. In straightforward cases of OA no specific investigations are required. If doubt exists, however, tests may be necessary including FBC, ESR and CRP, uric acid for suspected gout and X-rays of the affected joints especially following trauma, or pseudogout. Patients with OA should be offered education and advice as well as strengthening exercises and aerobic fitness training (if physically possible). If the patient is overweight, weight loss is critical, especially in OA of the knee. Paracetamol and topical NSAIDs are the first-line drug treatments. Elderly onset RA differs from younger onset RA in the following ways: a more balanced gender distribution; a higher frequency of acute onset; an association with systemic features; more frequent involvement of the shoulder girdle and higher disease activity. DMARD therapy should be used according to disease severity, as in younger onset RA. The current approach is for early, intensive intervention with combination therapy. Corticosteroids may be very effective in the elderly, however, prolonged use and/or high dosage may lead to marked toxicity especially osteoporosis and diabetes.",M1

METHODS: I present 12 patients with recurring PMR from a single clinical practice with long-term clinical follow-up (mean 14.3 years). RESULTS: Despite a disease-free interval off corticosteroids of 2 years or longer, these patients experienced 1 overt recurrence (or more) of PMR. CONCLUSION: The course of PMR is not uniformly monophasic, and patient and physician should remain alert to the possibility of recurring disease.",M1
19915991,"The clinical course of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> in Chinese.Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is diagnosed based on clinical features that may overlap with other rheumatic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Furthermore, a proportion of PMR patients may subsequently evolve into RA. The aim of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics of PMR patients in a Chinese cohort compared to a Caucasian series. Patients diagnosed to have PMR during 1997-2008 were reviewed for clinical features and compared to a reported Caucasian series. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies were determined by immunonephelometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Forty-four patients of southern Chinese origin were diagnosed to have PMR according to specialist opinion. Seventy-five percent of patients (n = 33) were &gt;65 years of age at diagnosis (mean +/- standard deviation, 75.8 +/- 9.6 years). The commonest feature at disease onset was elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate &gt;40 mm/h (100% vs. 95.7%; p = 0.17) and bilateral shoulder pain or stiffness (95.5% vs. 90.8%; p = 0.31), comparable in frequency to the Caucasian cohort. However, Chinese patients had significantly longer duration of symptoms before diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001) but less bilateral upper arm tenderness (p &lt; 0.001) and generalized stiffness (p = 0.01). Twelve (27.3%) patients evolved into RA after a median duration of 2 months from onset of PMR. RF and anti-CCP antibodies were positive in 66.7% and 60% of these patients compared to 9.4% and 6.2%, respectively, among those who did not evolve into RA during the period observed. Chinese patients with PMR have modestly different clinical profile compared to the Caucasian counterpart. RF and anti-CCP antibodies were more likely to be present in those who subsequently developed into RA.",M1
19901135,"Treatment of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>: a systematic review.BACKGROUND: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) treatment is based on low-dose glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoid-sparing agents have also been tested. Our objective was to systematically examine the peer-reviewed literature on PMR therapy, particularly the optimal glucocorticoid type, starting doses, and subsequent reduction regimens as well as glucocorticoid-sparing medications. METHODS: We searched Cochrane Databases and MEDLINE (1957 through December 2008) for English-language articles on PMR treatment (randomized trials, prospective cohorts, case-control trials, and case series) that included 20 or more patients. All data on study design, PMR definition criteria, medical therapy, and disease outcomes were collected using a standardized protocol. RESULTS: Thirty studies (13 randomized trials and 17 observational studies) were analyzed. No meta-analyses or systematic reviews were found. The PMR definition criteria, treatment protocols, and outcome measures differed widely among the trials. Starting prednisone doses higher than 10 mg/d were associated with fewer relapses and shorter therapy than were lower doses; starting prednisone doses of 15 mg/d or lower were associated with lower cumulative glucocorticoid doses than were higher starting prednisone doses; and starting prednisone doses higher than 15 mg/d were associated with more glucocorticoid-related adverse effects. Slow prednisone dose tapering (&lt;1 mg/mo) was associated with fewer relapses and more frequent glucocorticoid treatment cessation than faster tapering regimens. Initial addition of oral or intramuscular methotrexate provided efficacy at doses of 10 mg/wk or higher. Infliximab was ineffective as initial cotreatment. CONCLUSIONS: The scarcity of randomized trials and the high level of heterogeneity of studies on PMR therapy do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn. However, PMR remission seems to be achieved with prednisone treatment at a dose of 15 mg/d in most patients, and reductions below 10 mg/d should preferably follow a tapering rate of less than 1 mg/mo. Methotrexate seems to exert glucocorticoid-sparing properties.",M1

19851514,"Clinical, radiological, and biochemical characteristics in patients with diseases mimicking <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>.To find out clues to differentiate between polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and other diseases that mimic PMR. We studied Japanese patients with PMR (n = 7), pseudogout (n = 1), remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) syndrome (n = 1), and post-infectious polyarthritis (n = 1). The distribution of inflammation in patients was evaluated using a gallium-67 scintigraphy. We measured serum C-reactive protein (CRP), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients before and after treatment. Further, we compared the clinical course of PMR with that of other diseases that mimic PMR. Patients with pseudogout, RS3PE syndrome, post-infectious polyarthritis manifested similar changes in scintigraphic findings and serum CRP, MMP-3, and VEGF levels to PMR before the treatment. A significant reduction in serum CRP levels at one week after use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is a good clue to differentiate pseudogout and post-infectious polyarthritis from PMR. Chondrocalcinosis in the radiographs of joints is also effective to differentiate pseudogout from PMR. A small reduction of CRP levels after NSAIDs use and promptly ameliorated CRP and symptoms by a low-dose steroid therapy, which was commonly observed in patients with PMR, were also found in a patient with RS3PE syndrome. Pitting edema of the back of hands and gallium uptake in metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints were useful to differentiate RS3PE syndrome from PMR. In conclusion, pseudogout, RS3PE syndrome, post-infectious polyarthritis should be included in the spectrum of diseases mimicking PMR. A promptly decreased serum CRP level by NSAIDs is a good clue to differentiate pseudogout and post-infectious polyarthritis from PMR. Pitting edema of the back of hands and symmetric gallium uptake in MCP joints are characteristic for RS3PE syndrome.",M1
19808693,"Longitudinal examination with shoulder ultrasound of patients with <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>.OBJECTIVE: To determine if ultrasonography (US) and power Doppler (PD) may be useful in identifying polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) patients with relapsing disease. METHODS: For a mean of 41 months, 57 consecutive untreated patients with PMR were prospectively assessed for relapses/recurrences. This cohort represented all the patients diagnosed over a 18-month period in one Italian secondary referral centre. Clinical signs and symptoms as well as ESR and CRP were evaluated. US examination of the shoulders was performed in all 57 patients at diagnosis and after the onset of prednisone treatment (mean 24 +/- 3 weeks). Power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS) was performed in 24 patients. Shoulder sonograms were obtained according to standardized techniques. RESULTS: Prednisone therapy significantly reduced the frequency and the degree of subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis, long head biceps tenosynovitis and glenohumeral synovitis. At diagnosis, a positive PD signal was observed more frequently in the subacromial/subdeltoid bursae (33%). Prednisone therapy significantly reduced the frequency of patients with positive PD signal. Of the 44 patients in remission or with low disease activity at the time of the second US, 26 (59%) still had evidence of persistent inflammatory lesions. There was no association between the persistence of inflammation at US and relapses/recurrences; in contrast, a positive PD signal at diagnosis was significantly associated with the occurrence of relapses/recurrences at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Subclinical inflammation detected by US persists in most PMR patients despite glucocorticoid treatment. PDUS may be useful to detect at diagnosis the patients with most active inflammation who have a higher risk of relapses/recurrences.",M1
19773289,"Ultrasonographic monitoring of response to therapy in <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>.OBJECTIVE: To assess the responsiveness of ultrasound (US) inflammatory findings in the shoulder and hip of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) who started treatment with corticosteroids. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with active PMR who started treatment with prednisone in six Spanish centres were prospectively studied. The patients underwent clinical, laboratory and US assessment at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. The US investigation consisted of detection and quantification of inflammatory findings in the shoulder and hip. The responsiveness of clinical, laboratory and US parameters was tested by the standardised response mean. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability between US investigators was assessed. RESULTS: At baseline, 34 patients (69%) had inflammation in at least one bilateral site. During the follow-up period, clinical, laboratory and US variables showed a parallel decrease. A significant decrease in US inflammatory parameters was found at week 4 (p&lt;0.001). After 4 and 12 weeks of treatment with corticosteroids, US inflammatory findings showed similar or better sensitivity to change than clinical and laboratory markers of PMR activity. Intraobserver and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.96 and 0.99, respectively (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: US may be a responsive additional tool in monitoring the response to corticosteroids in patients with PMR in daily practice and multicentre trials.",M1
19738533,"Fusobacterium nucleatum endocarditis mimicking <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>.A case of Fusobacterium nucleatum endocarditis in an 80-year-old man is reported. The patient presented with a headache and nonspecific musculoskeletal symptoms and was misdiagnosed as having polymyalgia rheumatica. The diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis was delayed because of an insidious presentation, typical in infections with low virulence micro-organisms. The musculoskeletal symptoms, unresponsive to protracted corticosteroids, completely resolved with intravenous ampicillin treatment. Rheumatologic symptoms may hinder the correct diagnosis of subacute infective endocarditis. An atypical evolution of a common rheumatic disorder such as polymyalgia rheumatica should alert physicians to the possibility of bacterial endocarditis.",M1
19721349,"[Clinical features in patients with <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>]Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology affecting elderly patients and characterized by muscle pain and morning stiffness in proximal areas (pelvic and shoulder girdles and neck). It is sometimes difficult to distinguish PMR from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or vasculitis. In the present study, we examined the clinical characteristics of the patients diagnosed with PMR in our hospital retrospectively. There were 44 patients with the median age of 71s. Eighty percent of the patients were in their 60s or 70s, and 3 patients (6.8%) were in there 50s or younger. There was no sex preponderance in frequency. Fifteen patients (34%) presented with both proximal and distal muscle pain. Arthritis occurred in 16 patients (36%), the half of which was monarthritis or oligoarthritis, and was more involved in wrist or knee joint. Only 3 patients had temporal arteritis (TA) complicated with PMR. Mean of maximum serum CRP was 8.18 mg/dl, and rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies were positive in 2 patients and a patient, respectively. There was no patient positive for ANCA. Serum MMP-3 levels tended to be higher in female patients. Median of maximum prednisolone (PSL) dose used for the treatment was 0.195 mg/kg of body weight daily. No patient needed any immunosuppressants. In the 26 patients we had a chance to follow, there were no patients who developed RA 6 months after the initial diagnosis. Progression from PMR to RA was reported, and mean period between the diagnosis of PMR and RA was one to 5 years.",M1

METHODS: Cases were ascertained using physician billing and hospitalization data from the province of Manitoba (population 1.1 million). Focusing on the population age &gt;/=45 years, we compared 3 different case definition algorithms and also used statistical methods that accounted for imperfect case ascertainment to estimate the prevalence and the properties of the ascertainment algorithms. A hierarchical Bayesian latent class regression model was developed that also allowed us to assess differences across patient demographics (sex and region of residence). RESULTS: Using methods that account for the imperfect nature of both billing and hospitalization databases, we estimated the prevalence of PMR in women age &gt;/=45 years to be lower in urban areas (754.5 cases/100,000; 95% credible interval [95% CrI] 674.1-850.3) compared with rural areas (1,004 cases/100,000; 95% CrI 886.3-1,143). This regional trend was also seen in men age &gt;/=45 years, where the prevalence was estimated at 273.6 cases/100,000 (95% CrI 219.8-347.6) in urban areas and 380.7 cases/100,000 (95% CrI 311.3-468.1) in rural areas. Billing data appeared more sensitive in ascertaining cases than hospitalization data, and a large proportion of diagnoses was made by physicians other than rheumatologists. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a higher prevalence of PMR in rural versus urban regions. Our approach demonstrates the usefulness of methods that adjust for the imperfect nature of multiple information sources, which also allow for estimation of the sensitivity of different case ascertainment approaches.",M1

We report a case of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis that was distinguished from polymyalgia rheumatica with malignancy. A 77-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of pain and bilateral stiffness in her shoulders and her hips. Tests for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody were negative. Bone erosions and joint space narrowing were not detected radiographically, and polymyalgia rheumatica was suspected. Her arthralgia disappeared with a few days after treatment with prednisolone (10 mg per day) was started, and ESR and CRP were normalized. Computed tomographic scanning of the chest showed a nodular lesion in the right lower lobe, and biopsy revealed lung cancer. Positron-emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) performed before lung surgery showed increased uptake of FDG in the bilateral shoulder joints and wrist joints. Enhanced MRI showed synovitis and bone erosions in the right acromioclavicular joint and bilateral carpal bones and also radiographically bone erosions were seen in the carpometacarpal joint of the right thumb. Therefore, a diagnosis of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis was made. In patients with polymyalgia rheumatica, the detection of rheumatoid synovitis should be routinely evaluated.",M1

Twenty-two patients with SpA, 15 patients with RA, 38 patients with PMR/GCA and 17 HC were prospectively enrolled. The expression of differentiation and activation markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD28, CD45RA, CD45RO) characterizing T-cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. The frequency of CD3(+)CD4(+)CD28(-) memory/effector T-cells was increased in PB of patients with SpA (median 1.1%, range 0.1-69.6), RA (2.5%, 0-42.9) and PMR/GCA (2.7%, 0-49.5) when compared with HC (0.7%, 0-38.0) and tended to be higher in SF of SpA patients (4.5%, 0.2-7.2, P = 0.084).

METHODS: An inception cohort of all Olmsted County, Minnesota residents diagnosed with PMR between 1 January 1970 and 31 December 1999 was compared with non-PMR subjects (two for each PMR subject) from among residents. Both cohorts were followed longitudinally by complete medical record review from the incidence date of PMR (or index date for the non-PMR cohort) until death, incident PAD, migration, or 31 December 2006. PMR-related disease characteristics, traditional cardiovascular risk factors and diagnosis of PAD were abstracted from the medical record. Cumulative incidence of PAD was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risk of PAD in PMR compared with non-PMR. RESULTS: A total of 353 PMR patients (mean age 73.3 years, 67% women) and 705 non-PMR subjects (mean age 73.2 years, 68% female) were followed for a median of 11.0 years. PAD developed in 38 patients (10-year cumulative incidence, 8.5%) with PMR and in 28 non-PMR subjects (10-year cumulative incidence, 4.1%) (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 2.40 (1.47, 3.92)). After adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, patients with PMR still had a significantly higher risk for PAD (hazard ratio, 2.50 (1.53, 4.08)) compared with controls. Giant cell arteritis occurred in 63 (18%) PMR patients but was not predictive of PAD (P = 0.15). There was no difference between mortality in PMR and the non-PMR cohorts nor in PMR patients with and those without PAD (P = 0.16).

19254903,"Circulating cytokines in active <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>.OBJECTIVE: To characterise the circulating cytokine profile and the cellular source of circulating cytokines in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). METHODS: The study included 34 patients with active untreated PMR and 17 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Circulating cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array and ELISA. Intracellular cytokines were assessed in CD3+ and CD14+ cells by flow cytometry. Cytokines in cell culture supernatants were also determined after polyclonal stimulation of patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL6) were significantly higher in subjects with active PMR than in HC. Corticosteroid (CS) treatment was followed by a decrease in the level of IL6. Intracellular cytokine staining showed that circulating monocytes did not produce higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in patients with PMR than in HC. There was a discordance between serum levels and cytokine-producing monocyte and T cells, and it was not possible to demonstrate a Th1 bias in the peripheral compartment. CONCLUSIONS: Active PMR is characterised by increased serum levels of IL6, but not of other proinflammatory cytokines, that are rapidly suppressed by CS treatment. As circulating monocytes do not show increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, IL6 may be mainly produced in the inflamed tissue. A study of the circulating cytokine profile and its cellular source may provide a clue to new therapeutic options.",M1
19248111,"Familial associations of rheumatoid arthritis with autoimmune diseases and related conditions.OBJECTIVE: In the era of genome-wide association studies, familial risks are used to estimate disease heritability and the likelihood of candidate-gene identification. This study was undertaken to estimate associations of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with any of 33 autoimmune diseases and related conditions among parents and offspring, singleton siblings, twins, and spouses. METHODS: The Multigeneration Register in Sweden was used as a reliable source of information on Swedish families throughout the last century. Data on autoimmune diseases in individual family members were obtained through linkage to the Hospital Discharge Register. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated as a measure of the relative risk of RA in family members of patients with RA or any of 33 other autoimmune diseases or related conditions, as compared with the relative risk of RA in those lacking an affected family member. RESULTS: Among a total of 447,704 patients, 47,361 were diagnosed as having RA. The SIRs for RA were 3.02 in offspring of affected parents, 4.64 in siblings, 9.31 in multiplex families, 6.48 in twins, and 1.17 in spouses. Significant associations with the familial risk of RA in offspring according to parental proband were observed for ankylosing spondylitis (SIR 2.96), localized scleroderma (SIR 2.40), Sjögren's syndrome (SIR 2.25), systemic lupus erythematosus (SIR 2.13), systemic sclerosis (SIR 1.65), Hashimoto thyroiditis/hypothyroidism (SIR 1.54), pernicious anemia (SIR 1.53), sarcoidosis (SIR 1.40), psoriasis (SIR 1.36), Wegener's granulomatosis (SIR 1.34), and asthma or <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (SIR 1.32).

To investigate whether there is a difference in immunological aspects among these 3 disorders, we performed a phenotypic analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes.PATIENTS AND METHODS:Eleven patients with early RA, 14 with PMR and 11 with RS3PE were enrolled in this study. After separation of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood using the Ficoll-Hypaque method, surface markers and intracellular cytokines of lymphocytes were analyzed by 2- or 3-color flow cytometry. RESULTS:Both PMR and RS3PE showed a significant decrease in CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD25&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells (p&lt;0.05), and significant increases in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;IFN-gamma&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;IL-4- (p&lt;0.05), CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;IFN-gamma&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;IL-4- (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01, respectively) and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;TNF-alpha&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells (p&lt;0.05) compared with early RA. CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were higher in PMR than in RS3PE (p&lt;0.01), but there were no significant differences in any other phenotypes between these disorders. CONCLUSION:A decrease in activated cytotoxic/suppressor T cells and increases in circulating Th1 and Tc1 cells may be common characteristics of PMR and RS3PE in comparison with early RA. Both disorders are clearly different from early RA, and probably belong to the same disease entity with regard to phenotypes of peripheral blood lymphocytes.",M1
19099273,"[<e>Polymyalgia rheumatica</e>]Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease with unknown aetiology, affecting predominately people of middle age and older. Besides clinical symptoms and diagnostics, imaging techniques including sonography and magnetic resonance imaging may provide evidence of typical inflammatory lesions with bilateral bursitis subdeltoidea or subacromialis, tenosynovitis of the biceps tendon sheath and/or synovitis of the shoulder joints and thus may support the diagnosis of this disease in difficult cases. Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of treatment of PMR, but adverse events because of chronic corticosteroid use are observed in more than 50% of treated patients. Whether immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate and tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors are effective in the therapy of PMR has still not yet been clarified.",M1

METHODS: Data were systematically retrieved and selected from PUBMED, EMBASE and CINAHL databases (6097 hits). RESULTS: A total of 28 studies (2382 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The risk of adverse events over all studies was 150 per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval (CI) 132 to 169). Psychological and behavioural adverse events (eg, minor mood disturbances) were most frequently reported, followed by gastrointestinal events (eg, dyspepsia, dysphagia). In 14 studies comprising 796 patients with rheumatoid arthritis the risk of adverse events was 43/100 patient-years (95% CI 30 to 55), in 4 studies of 167 patients with <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> the risk of adverse events was 80/100 patient-years (95% CI 15 to 146), and in 10 studies of 1419 patients with inflammatory bowel disease the risk of adverse events was 555/100 patient-years (95% CI 391 to 718). High rates of adverse events were reported in high-quality studies with short follow-up, notably in studies of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of adverse events depends on study design and disease. Studies on inflammatory bowel disease were often of short duration with frequent documentation of adverse events which resulted in higher adverse event rates whereas, in studies of rheumatoid arthritis, the longer follow-up may have resulted in lower adverse event rates. In most studies aimed at efficacy of glucocorticoids or other drugs, adverse events were not systematically assessed. Clear guidelines on assessment of adverse events are lacking.",M1

18687983,"<e>Polymyalgia rheumatica</e> in primary care: a cohort study of the diagnostic criteria and outcome.BACKGROUND: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is common and is usually diagnosed and managed in primary care. There are no generally accepted primary care criteria for diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: To identify what features are used to diagnose PMR, to benchmark these against diagnostic criteria and to identify features at diagnosis with prognostic significance. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients diagnosed with PMR in three UK general practices between January 1994 and December 2003. The medical records were examined for features of PMR. The duration of steroid treatment was used as a proxy for duration of disease. Analysis of prognostic predictors was by Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three patients were identified, giving an overall annual incidence of 11.3 per 10 000 patients aged 50 or over. The median age at diagnosis was 75 (interquartile range 69, 79) years: 138 (75%) were female. The most common diagnostic features were proximal muscle pain in 151 (82%), raised inflammatory markers in 160 (87%), clinical response to corticosteroids in 166 (91%) and normalization of inflammatory markers in 147 (81%). Twenty (11%) had normal inflammatory indices. The median duration of treatment was 1.4 years (interquartile range 0.8, 2.4). Female sex and raised inflammatory markers were independently associated with longer treatment: female hazard ratio 1.5 (1.0, 2.2) P = 0.047 and raised inflammatory markers 2.0 (1.2, 3.2) P = 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care practitioners do not use established criteria to diagnose PMR and sometimes diagnose the condition even when inflammatory markers are normal. This exposes patients to a risk of inappropriate steroid use.",M1
18668607,"Serum interleukin-6 receptor in <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>: a potential marker of relapse/recurrence risk.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the modulation of systemic levels of soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and soluble gp130 (sgp130) in untreated and treated polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) patients during a followup period of at least 24 months in order to evaluate the relationship of these molecules with clinical outcome and their feasibility to provide a prognostic tool in clinical practice. METHODS: We analyzed sIL-6R and sgp130 serum levels in 93 PMR patients, and 46 age-matched normal controls, at disease onset and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of followup during corticosteroid therapy by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: No difference in sIL-6R and sgp130 levels was observed between PMR patients and normal controls at disease onset or during followup. A significant correlation was found between the number of relapses and sIL-6R concentrations at baseline and after 1, 3, and 12 months of therapy. No correlation was found between sgp130 levels and the number of relapses. Cox multivariate analysis indicated that the best model for predicting relapses was identified by sIL-6R levels and the hemoglobin value at baseline. We found that high sIL-6R levels combined with low hemoglobin values resulted in a 10.1-fold increased risk of relapse. CONCLUSION: Our data support the identification of a potential prognostic marker of PMR outcome that might have important implications in clinical practice. Because targeting sIL-6R with blocking antibodies has proven useful in other rheumatic disorders, our results could suggest the opportunity to evaluate sIL-6R-blocking treatment in patients with PMR and elevated levels of sIL-6R at disease onset.",M1

18578959,"Long-term follow-up of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> patients treated with methotrexate and steroids.OBJECTIVE: A series of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) who received the steroid-sparing combination therapy, prednisone and methotrexate (MTX), underwent a long-term follow-up study at five years to investigate possible reductions of steroid-related side effects. Additional end-points were the number of patients still in need of steroid treatment, the cumulative steroid dose, and the number of flare-ups of PMR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven PMR patients who were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial on the efficacy of MTX added to standard steroid treatment were reviewed after 5 years. Information was collected on the patients' previous health conditions or causes of death through a standardized questionnaire by direct visit, chart review, or interviews with relatives. RESULTS: After 6 years from initiation of therapy, MTX-treated patients had lower ESR (17.1+/-9.7 mm/h vs. 26.8+/-22.9 mm/h, p=0.08) and CRP (2.7+/-2.3 mg/L vs. 10.2+/-16.4 mg/L, p=0.04). 31% MTX-treated patients were still on steroids in comparison with 39.3% controls. The mean cumulative dosage of prednisone in MTX-treated patients was 2.6+/-3.8 g in comparison with 3.2+/-4.1 g for controls (p=0.6). PMR flare-ups were seen in 30.8% of MTX-treated patients and in 44.4% of controls (p=0.39). During the follow-up, 58 and 55 side effects were observed in MTX-treated patients and in controls, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MTX-treated patients showed slightly less residual inflammation than controls, with the same incidence of steroid-related side effects. PMR is not a benign condition, as often reported, since one third of patients need steroid treatment for more than 6 years.",M1
18477738,"Validity of the <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> activity score in primary care practice.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity and reliability of the polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) activity score (PMR-AS) for relapse diagnosis by general practitioners (GPs) who manage a large proportion of patients with PMR. METHODS: Seven clinical vignettes of PMR were used, for which 35 rheumatologists previously made a diagnosis of relapse or no relapse with greater than 80% agreement. These vignettes were submitted to 163 GPs, who were asked to assess disease activity using a visual analogue scale (VASph), this being the only physician-dependent component of the PMR-AS. The 1116 available vignette-GP combinations were used to assess differences in VASph assessed by GPs versus rheumatologists. Statistical associations linking a relapse diagnosis by the rheumatologists (the reference standard) to the value of the GP-assessed PMR-AS or its components (GP-assessed VASph, visual analogue scale pain score, C-reactive protein, morning stiffness and elevation of upper limbs) were evaluated. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between VASph scores by GPs versus rheumatologists for any of the vignettes. A relapse diagnosis was strongly associated with PMR-AS values of 7 or more (sensitivity 99.4%; specificity 93.3%; agreement 95.9% (95% CI 94.5% to 97.0%) with kappa = 0.92). Of the 590 GP-vignette combinations with PMR-AS values lower than 7, all but three (0.5%) had no relapse diagnosis. Of 510 combinations with PMR-AS values of 7 or more, only 42 (8%) had no flare diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the validity of the PMR-AS in primary care practice and provides evidence that a good scoring system can be useful to guide clinical and therapeutic decisions.",M1

At each visit, the rheumatologist assessed disease activity using a visual analog scale (VAS) and recorded whether a disease flare was diagnosed and/or the glucocorticoid dose changed. Overall, 137 visits including 49 pairs (allowing intraindividual comparisons) were available; a disease flare was diagnosed at 32 visits. We evaluated statistical associations linking flare diagnosis to the PMR-AS, each of its components (VAS, VAS for pain, C-reactive protein, morning stiffness, and elevation of upper limbs), and changes in these parameters between 2 visits. RESULTS: Associations with disease flare diagnosis were strongest for PMR-AS scores &gt; or =9.35 (agreement 92%, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 85.8-95.7%, kappa = 0.78; sensitivity 96.6%, 95% CI 80.4-99.8; specificity 90.7%, 95% CI 83.2-95.2) and for DeltaPMR-AS scores &gt; or =6.6 (agreement 98%, 95% CI 88.0-99.9%, kappa = 0.95; sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 74.7-100; specificity 97.1%, 95% CI 82.9-99.8). Other parameters showed weaker diagnostic performance. CONCLUSION: This study supplies new evidence that the PMR-AS is useful for monitoring PMR activity in everyday practice and for managing glucocorticoid tapering.

METHODS: In all, 12 consecutive, untreated new patients with PMR were investigated. Five patients with fibromyalgia, two patients with cervical osteoarthritis and six patients with spondyloarthritis with neck pain served as controls. MRI of the cervical spine was performed in all 12 PMR case patients and in 13 control patients. Two of the four patients with PMR with pelvic girdle pain also had MRI of the lumbar spine. RESULTS: MRI evidence of interspinous cervical bursitis was found in all patients with PMR, and in three patients with fibromyalgia, in two with psoriatic spondylitis and one with cervical osteoarthritis. A moderate to marked (grade &gt;or=2 on a semiquantitative 0-3 scale) cervical bursitis occurred significantly more frequently in patients with PMR than in control patients (83.3% compared with 30.7%, p = 0.015). In all patients and controls with cervical bursitis the involvement was found at the C5-C7 cervical interspaces. MRI of the lumbar spine showed lumbar interspinous bursitis at the L3-L5 lumbar interspaces in the two patients with PMR and pelvic girdle pain examined. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical interspinous bursitis is a likely basis for discomfort in the neck of patients with PMR. The prominent inflammatory involvement of cervical bursae supports the hypothesis that PMR is a disorder of prominent involvement of extra-articular synovial structures.",M1

The suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and ageing may contribute to the pathogenesis of PMR. Chronic stress (i.e. interpersonal, chronic infections etc.) in elderly people may represent a risk factor for the development of PMR. In fact, elderly represent per se a condition of endocrine senescence including adrenal hypofunction, in addition chronic stress represents a further harmful stimulus to seriously compromise endogenous glucocorticoid production. Synovitis and vasculitis characterize the majority of the patients. Serum cytokine and steroidal hormone patterns suggest that patients with PMR have an intensive inflammatory reaction. As a matter of fact, glucocorticoids represent the most useful temporary  replacement  treatment during the active phase of PMR. The use of modified-release glucocorticoids that might induce higher levels during the night (circadian rhythms as in physiological conditions), will represent another important approach to optimize PMR treatment and reduce the side effects. Combination therapy between glucocorticoids and inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokines should be tested in large studies and early cases of PMR.",M1

METHODS: A 3-stage hybrid consensus approach was used to develop potential PMR classification criteria. The first stage consisted of a facilitated meeting of 27 international experts who anonymously rated the importance of 68 potential criteria. The second stage involved a meeting of the experts, who were provided with the results of the first round of ratings and were then asked to re-rate the criteria. In the third stage, the wider acceptance of the 43 criteria that received &gt; 50% support at round 2 was evaluated using an extended mailed survey of 111 rheumatologists and 53 nonrheumatologists in the United States, Canada, and Northern and Western Europe. RESULTS: A total of 68 and 50 criteria were identified and rated in round 1 and round 2, respectively. In round 2, 43 of the 50 items achieved at least 50% support, including 10 core criteria achieving 100% support. In round 3, over 70% of survey respondents agreed on the importance of 7 core criteria. These were age &gt;or=50 years, duration &gt;or=2 weeks, bilateral shoulder and/or pelvic girdle aching, duration of morning stiffness &gt; 45 min, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevated C-reactive protein, and rapid steroid response (&gt; 75% global response within 1 wk to prednisolone/prednisone 15 20 mg daily). Among physical signs, more than 70% of survey respondents agreed on the importance of assessing pain and limitation of shoulder (84%) and/or hip (76%) on motion, but agreement was low for peripheral signs like carpal tunnel, tenosynovitis, and peripheral arthritis. CONCLUSION: There are differences in opinion as to what PMR is and how it should be treated. These findings make it important to develop classification criteria for PMR.

METHODS: The study group comprised patients with relapsing PMR who were not able to reduce their prednisone dosage below 7.5-10 mg/day and who had experienced corticosteroid-related side effects. Patients received injections of etanercept 25 mg twice weekly for 24 weeks, and were followed up for 3 additional months after treatment withdrawal. Patients regularly underwent clinical assessment, measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, and ultrasound (US) examination of the shoulders during the 9 months of the followup period. RESULTS: All 6 enrolled patients responded to etanercept with sustained remission (improvement of at least 70% according to European League Against Rheumatism response criteria for PMR in 4 patients and at least 50% in 2 patients) and were able to significantly reduce their median prednisone daily dosage without experiencing a disease relapse (8.75 mg versus 2.5 mg; P = 0.026) at the end of the 9-month study period. US shoulder examination performed at the end of followup demonstrated a parallel reduction of glenohumeral and periarticular inflammation.

METHODS: Sixty-one patients with PMR were randomly assigned to two groups, the 32 patients in the treatment group treated with YHD two doses per day combined with prednisone and the 29 patients in the control group treated with prednisone alone. The dosage of prednisone used was started from 20 mg/d and decreased step by step as possible after 2 weeks according to patient's condition. The therapeutic course for them all was 12 weeks. RESULTS: The therapeutic efficacy of PMR in the 32 patients of the treatment group was remission in 9 (28.1%), markedly effective in 15 (46.9%), effective in 7 (21.9%), and ineffective in 1 (3.1%), with the total effective rate of 96.9%; while that for the 29 patients of the control group, the corresponding numbers and percentages were 3 (10.3%), 11 (37.9%), 10 (34.5%), 5 (17.2%), and 82.8%.

17953280,"Definition of adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis from elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis by studying T-lymphocyte subpopulations, their soluble receptors and soluble receptor of interleukin-2.AIMS: The study of the distribution of T-lymphocyte sub-populations has revealed some immune characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as well as <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR). There is much evidence that the subsets of T-lymphocyte subpopulations are well correlated with the age of the patient and the precise diagnosis of RA and PMR. The aims of the study were to evaluate the absolute number and percentage of T-lymphocyte subpopulation subsets in peripheral blood and their soluble receptors and serum soluble receptors of interleukin-2. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients with RA were divided into 21 adult-onset RA (AoRA) and 15 elderly-onsets RA (EoRA) patients. They were compared with 48 PMR patients, 21 normal subjects under 45 years and 17 healthy elderly subjects over 65 years. T-lymphocyte subsets were studied by FACSCAN with double stained specific monoclonal antibodies. The EL ISA method was used to determine soluble receptors of CD4+ and CD8+ and IL-2. RESULTS: The AoRA patients had a significant alteration of T-lymphocyte sub-populations as well as their specific soluble receptors compared to EoRA patients. On the other hand, distribution of T-lymphocyte sub-populations in EoRA patients was quite similar to that in PMR patients. CONCLUSIONS: This method is probably not applicable for daily routine clinical practice but provides some interesting data for differential diagnosis between RA and PMR.",M1

17929127,"Clinical characteristics of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> in Japanese patients: evidence of synovitis and extracapsular inflammatory changes by fat suppression magnetic resonance imaging.Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory condition of unknown etiology characterized by diffuse pain and morning stiffness involving neck, shoulder, and pelvic girdles. To facilitate an understanding of PMR and its proper diagnosis, we evaluated clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and radiographic findings of 32 Japanese patients with it. Distal musculoskeletal manifestations were more frequently observed than had been thought before (81% of the patients), and peripheral arthritis was most common (75%). The joints most often affected were knees and wrists, and most episodes were presented as bilateral oligo- or polyarthritis. A swelling of hands was observed in 34% of the patients. Using contrast-enhanced fat suppression magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the shoulder, we found the evidence of subacromial and subdeltoid bursitis (100%), glenohumeral joint synovitis (93%), and biceps tenosynovitis (57%) in the PMR patients examined. Inflammatory changes in soft tissues around the joint capsule were prominent. By knee MRI, suprapatellar bursitis and joint synovitis were visualized in all cases examined, and extracapsular abnormalities were also prominent in 90% of the patients. Serum matrix metalloproteinase-3, a parameter of synovial inflammation, was significantly increased in PMR patients. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody was useful for differential diagnosis between PMR and elderly onset rheumatoid arthritis. In conclusion, joint and periarticular synovitis seems to be commonly and primarily responsible for the proximal and distal musculoskeletal symptoms of PMR. The presence of the extracapsular change, probably a nonspecific extension of synovitis, can explain the severe discomfort that radiates toward the periphery. To avoid making a wrong diagnosis, we should be aware that peripheral synovitis is one of the hallmarks of PMR.",M1
17907197,"Evidence for a different anatomic basis for joint disease localization in <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> in comparison with rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVE: The anatomic basis for joint disease localization in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is poorly understood. This study used contrast-enhanced and fat suppression magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the relationship between synovial and extracapsular inflammation in PMR and early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Ten patients with new-onset PMR and 10 patients with early RA underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and conventional MRI of affected metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. Synovitis and tenosynovitis were calculated based on the number of enhancing voxels, initial rate of enhancement, and maximal enhancement of gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). Periarticular bone erosion and bone edema were scored according to the OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials) scoring system in both groups. The degree of extracapsular Gd-DTPA enhancement was assessed in both conditions using semiquantitative scoring. RESULTS: No significant differences were seen in the volume of synovitis (P = 0.294), degree of flexor tenosynovitis (P = 0.532), periarticular erosions (P = 0.579), or degree of bone edema (P = 0.143) between RA and PMR joints. However, despite comparable degrees of synovitis, the proportion of MCP joints showing extracapsular enhancement was higher in the PMR group (100%) than in the RA group (50%) (P = 0.030). One PMR patient, but none of the RA patients, had bone edema at the capsular insertion. CONCLUSION: Despite degrees of synovitis and tenosynovitis comparable with those in RA, PMR-related hand disease is associated with prominent extracapsular changes, suggesting that inflammation in these tissues is more prominent than joint synovitis, which is common in both conditions. This suggests that the anatomic basis for joint disease localization differs between RA and PMR.",M1

METHODS: Circulating levels of RANKL and OPG were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in PMR patients with active untreated disease and in patients treated by corticosteroids over a 12-month follow-up period. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant differences in circulating levels of OPG between PMR patients either in the active phase of the disease or during all follow-up period compared to normal controls. On the other hand, systemic production of sRANKL is increased and is not modulated by corticosteroid treatment. CONCLUSION: In PMR increased levels of sRANKL may be related to bone osteoporosis. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate the relationship between the RANK/RANKL/OPG system and bone turnover in PMR patients.",M1

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 129 participants in 8 hospitals in England who met a modified version of the Jones and Hazleman criteria and had not started steroid therapy. The main outcome measures were response to steroids after 3 weeks (minimum 50% improvement in proximal pain, morning stiffness &lt;30 minutes, acute-phase response not elevated), relapses, QOL as measured by the Short Form 36 and Health Assessment Questionnaire, and diagnosis reassessment at 1 year. RESULTS: At 3 weeks, 55% of participants failed to meet our definition of a complete response to steroid therapy. Both physical and mental QOL at presentation were substantially lower than general population norms and improved by 12.6 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 10.8, 14.4) and 11.2 (95% CI 8.5, 13.8) points, respectively, at 1 year. Proximal pain and longer morning stiffness were significantly associated with lower physical QOL during followup, whereas erythrocyte sedimentation rate was most strongly associated with lower mental QOL during followup. There was moderate agreement between clinicians in confirming the PMR diagnosis (kappa coefficients 0.49-0.65). CONCLUSION: PMR is a heterogeneous disease with a major impact on QOL.

METHODS: First, 78 patients with PMR (50 women/28 men, mean age 65.97 years) were enrolled in a cross-sectional evaluation. The PMR-AS, patient's satisfaction with disease status (PATSAT; range 1-5), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; first hour), and a visual analog scale of patients' general health assessment (VAS patient global; range 0-100) were recorded. Subsequently, another 39 PMR patients (24 women/15 men, mean age 68.12 years) were followed longitudinally. Relationships between the PMR-AS, PATSAT, ESR, and VAS patient global were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman's rank correlation, and kappa statistics. PMR-AS values in patients with a PATSAT score of 1 and a VAS patient global &lt;10 formed the basis to establish a remission threshold. RESULTS: PMR-AS values were significantly related to PATSAT (P &lt; 0.001), VAS patient global (P &lt; 0.001), and ESR (P &lt; 0.01). PATSAT and VAS patient global were reasonably different (kappa = 0.226). The median PMR-AS score in patients with PATSAT score 1 and VAS patient global &lt;10 was 0.7 (range 0-3.3), and the respective 75th percentile was 1.3. To enhance applicability, a range from 0 to 1.5 was proposed to define remission in PMR. The median ESR in these patients was 10 mm/hour (range 3-28), indicating external validity. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the reliability, validity, and applicability of the PMR-AS in daily routine. Moreover, we proposed a remission threshold (0-1.5) founded on patient-dependent parameters.",M1

Although infliximab has been used occasionally in steroid-resistant cases, its efficacy has not been demonstrated in a controlled study. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of prednisone plus infliximab with that of prednisone plus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: 7 rheumatology clinics in Italy. PATIENTS: 51 patients with newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica. Patients with associated giant cell arteritis and those who had been previously treated with steroids or biological or immunosuppressive agents were excluded. INTERVENTION: Initial therapy with oral prednisone tapered from 15 mg/d to 0 mg/d over 16 weeks according to a standard protocol, plus infusions of placebo or infliximab, 3 mg/kg of body weight, at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22. MEASUREMENTS: The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients without relapse or recurrence through week 52. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients no longer taking prednisone, the number of relapses and recurrences, the duration of prednisone therapy, and the cumulative prednisone dose. RESULTS: Four patients (3 in the infliximab group and 1 in the placebo group) did not complete the trial. The proportion of patients who were free of relapse and recurrence at 52 weeks did not differ between groups (6 of 20 patients [30%] in the infliximab group vs. 10 of 27 patients [37%] in the placebo group; adjusted risk difference, -3 percentage points [95% CI, -31 to 24 percentage points]; P = 0.80). In a sensitivity analysis that included dropouts, the best-case scenario yielded a difference of 5 percentage points (CI, -21 to 31 percentage points) between the groups. The secondary outcomes at weeks 22 and 52 did not differ between the groups. LIMITATIONS: The study had a small sample and a short follow-up. A low dosage of infliximab was used, and the prednisone dosage was rapidly tapered. CONCLUSIONS: Although too small to be definitive, the trial provides evidence that adding infliximab to prednisone for treating newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica is of no benefit and may be harmful. If there is benefit, it is unlikely to be large. Australian Clinical Trials Registry number: ACTRN012606000205538.",M1

METHODS: Nine clinical vignettes of PMR were written by a panel of experts and submitted to 35 rheumatologists, who were asked to assess disease activity using a visual analog scale (VASph) and to determine whether there was a relapse of PMR requiring an increase in the glucocorticoid dose. In 7 vignettes, &gt;80% of the rheumatologists agreed on the diagnosis of relapse justifying the glucocorticoid dose decision. A total of 243 vignette-physician combinations were obtained. Using these vignettes, we evaluated statistical associations linking a decision to increase the glucocorticoid dose to the value of PMR-AS, of its components (VASph, visual analog scale for pain [VASp], C-reactive protein level [CRP], morning stiffness [MST], and elevation of upper limbs [EUL]), or to the difference in these variables between the last 2 visits (dPMR-AS, dVASph, dVASp, dCRP, dMST, and dEUL). RESULTS: The strongest associations with a decision to increase the glucocorticoid dose occurred with dPMR-AS &gt;4.2, dMST &gt;10 minutes, dVASph &gt;1.55, and dCRP &gt;4 mg/dl (99.3% sensitivity, 100% specificity for all 4 variables); MST &gt;or=10 minutes (100% sensitivity, 99.3% specificity); PMR-AS &gt;or=7 (98.1% sensitivity, 94.3% specificity); VASph &gt;or=2.25 (94.2% sensitivity, 83.6% specificity); and CRP level &gt;or=14.5 mg/liter (66.3% sensitivity, 99.3% specificity). CONCLUSION: Despite inter-individual variations in VASph, PMR-AS was a good indicator of disease activity. However, MST, dMST, dVASph, dPMR-AS, and dCRP performed better than PMR-AS.

METHODS: We assembled a population-based incidence cohort of 364 patients with PMR first diagnosed between January 1, 1970 and December 31, 1999. Inclusion criteria were age &gt; or = 50 years, bilateral aching and morning stiffness involving at least 2 areas (neck, shoulders, hips, or proximal aspects of the thighs), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &gt; or = 40 mm/hour. In patients who fulfilled the first 2 criteria but had a normal ESR, a rapid response to low-dose glucocorticoids served as the third criterion. Patients were followed up until death or December 31, 2004. Cox models with time-dependent covariates were used to examine the association between glucocorticoid exposure and risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS: A total of 364 PMR patients (mean age 73 years, 67% women) were followed for a median of 7.6 years. During the disease course, 310 (85%) patients received glucocorticoids. After adjusting for age, calendar year, and ESR, patients who received glucocorticoids did not have a significantly higher risk for myocardial infarction, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, or cerebrovascular disease (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.58 [0.29-1.18], 0.85 [0.45-1.54], 0.58 [0.24-1.40], and 0.65 [0.33-1.26], respectively) compared with those who did not receive glucocorticoids.

Its clinical hallmark is the severity of pain in the shoulder and pelvic girdle. Mild to moderate synovitis and/or bursitis of the joints involved has been described. Neuropeptides are involved in nociception and modulation of inflammatory reaction. To evaluate whether neuropeptides have a role in PMR pathophysiology, we studied the expression of substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and somatostatin (SOM) in shoulder synovial tissues of PMR patients. METHODS: Synovial expression of neuropeptides was investigated by immunohistochemical analysis, in two groups of PMR patients: the first one at the onset of disease and the second one after corticosteroid treatment, and in other joint diseases, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). RESULTS: The only significant expression of VIP was found in PMR and, to a lesser extent, in RA synovial tissue. In PMR, we observed VIP immunostaining both in the lining layer and in the sublining area. In patients on corticosteroid treatment VIP lining layer expression was not significantly different while VIP positive cells in the sublining area were almost absent. CONCLUSION: Local VIP production in PMR synovial tissue might contribute to the typical musculoskeletal discomfort and it may have a role in the immunomodulation of synovial inflammation.",M1

She was referred to a rheumatologist 10 days after her initial presentation. Within 4 weeks she presented to an outpatient clinic with nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, painful mouth ulcers, rash on her legs and a further decline in appetite; she was readmitted to hospital. Within 4 months of initial presentation she became jaundiced. INVESTIGATIONS: At initial presentation, physical examination, biochemical, hematological and autoimmune screening, radiography of the pelvis, an abdominal ultrasound, and electromyography were conducted. At referral to a rheumatologist similar tests were repeated. At presentation to the outpatient clinic, hematological and biochemical screening, and a urine dipstick test were conducted. At readmittance to hospital, infectious and autoimmune screening, radiography of the chest, electrocardiogram, ultrasound of the abdomen, and renal biopsy were conducted. At the time of development of jaundice, biochemical and hematological screening, CT of the abdomen and ultrasound-guided biopsy of a pancreatic mass were conducted.

17131799,"[<e>Polymyalgia rheumatica</e>]Polymyalgia rheumatica is a disorder that affects people over 50 years of age. The etiology of the disease has not been hitherto clarified exactly. Its incidence among people over 50 is in the range of 0.1-0.5%. The incidence rate peaks in the age group of 60-70 years. It is also found in younger people, but far less frequently. The diagnosis is based primarily on locomotor complains--namely on pronounced pain, morning stiffness of the shoulder girdle, pelvic girdle and neck. Complaints relating to the arms and legs (such as muscular weakness, oedema, tendonitis etc.) are also observed, however, in one third of the cases. The diagnostic criteria are defined empirically. Polymyalgia rheumatica was formerly considered to be a form of elderly onset rheumatoid arthritis. The progressive erosion process is absent in the case of polymyalgia rheumatica unlike in the case of rheumatoid arthritis. Numerous factors are known, which point to a link between polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell vasculitis, arthritis, but the precise nature of this relationship remains unknown. Both conditions affect the same age group in the general population and they are even found--not infrequently--in the same patient. Polymyalgia rheumatica can be found in 40% of the patients suffering from arthritis while the histological examination detected mild vasculitis in approximately 10% of the patients suffering for  isolated  polymyalgia rheumatica. The response to be given to the acute phase is similar in both disorders. Scandinavian authors consider polymyalgia rheumatica as the appearance of generalised arthritis. Arthroscopic, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging as well as isotopic studies show unequivocally, that in the background of the osteo-muscular symptoms, complaints, inflammation is to be found partly of the joints but primarily that of the periarticular synovial structures. The above mentioned--dominant--proximal symptoms can often mask the distal locomotor disorders (pitting oedema of the hands and feet, tendonitis, tendosynovitis, carpal tunnel syndrome). The disorder may be accompanied by atypical generalised symptoms (loss of appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue). An excellent indicators of the acute phase reactions are erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. These are suitable for monitoring the effectiveness of the therapy, for indicating a relapse/recurrence. It should be noted, that polymyalgia rheumatica may also be present if the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein values are low. This disorder is also characterised by fast and effective response to corticosteroid, which should be administered for 1-2 years. In some individual cases a different dosage regime may be necessary: steroid administered in low dosage over a longer period of time. Administration of methotrexate and anti-tumor necrotic factor-alpha may also be considered as alternative or adjuvant therapy for lowering the quantity of corticosteroid. Further multicenter, double blind studies should, however, be performed on large number of patients in this regard.",M1

METHODS: All consecutive patients with isolated PMR underwent a FDG-PET scan before treatment with steroids was started and--if logistics allowed--at 3 and 6 months. PET scans were scored at seven different vascular areas and a total vascular score (TVS) was calculated, ranging from 0 to 21. FDG uptake in the shoulders, the hips and the processi spinosi of the vertebrae was scored as 0 (no uptake), 1 (moderate uptake) or 2 (intense uptake). RESULTS: Thirty-five patients entered the study. At diagnosis, vascular FDG uptake was noted in 11 patients (31%), predominantly at the subclavian arteries. Mean TVS was low. FDG uptake in the shoulders was noted in 94% of patients, in the hips in 89% and in the processi spinosi of the vertebrae in 51%. The intensity of FDG uptake in the large vessels or in the shoulders, hips or processi spinosi did not correlate with the risk of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Only one in three patients has an (moderately) increased vascular FDG uptake, especially in the subclavian arteries. The vast majority has inflammation of shoulders and hips, and half of them have increased FDG-uptake at the processi spinosi. Results of FDG-PET scans in patients with PMR did not correlate with their risk of relapse.",M1

Physicians must be aware that many conditions may simulate PMR, including diseases that carry a grim prognosis or require urgent treatment. PMR may be the first manifestation of giant cell arteritis, and a painstaking search for other signs is mandatory. PMR may inaugurate other rheumatologic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, RS3PE syndrome, spondyloarthropathy, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), myopathy, vasculitis, and chondrocalcinosis. Finally, PMR may be the first manifestation of an endocrine disorder, a malignancy, or an infection. Failure to respond to glucocorticoid therapy should suggest giant cell arteritis, malignant disease, or infection. Ultrasonography may assist in the diagnosis by showing bilateral subdeltoid bursitis. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of the treatment of PMR. Although the optimal starting dosage and tapering schedule are not agreed on, a low starting dosage and slow tapering may decrease the relapse rate. Methotrexate is probably useful when glucocorticoid dependency develops. In contrast, TNF-alpha antagonists are probably ineffective.",M1

16891918,"Peripheral musculoskeletal manifestations in <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>.OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the frequency and characteristics of the peripheral musculoskeletal manifestations in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), evaluate if PMR with peripheral synovitis represents a subset with a more severe disease, and examine for clinical and laboratory characteristics at onset of PMR that might later predict rheumatoid arthritis (RA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were diagnosed with PMR according to the 1982 Chuang criteria. Patients were followed up between 1990 and 2002. The following musculoskeletal manifestations at onset and during the follow up were considered: peripheral synovitis, distal extremity swelling with pitting edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, and distal tenosynovitis. RESULTS: Thirty-eight of the 74 patients (51%) showed distal musculoskeletal symptoms: 29 (39%) had peripheral synovitis, 4 (5%) presented pitting edema, 4 (5%) experienced carpal tunnel syndrome, and one (1.3%) had distal tenosynovitis. These manifestations resolved completely after corticosteroid therapy was initiated. Peripheral synovitis was oligoarticular and often transient. The joints most frequently involved were the wrist, metacarpophalangeal, and knee. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was normal in 7 patients. When comparing patients with PMR with and without peripheral synovitis, no statistically significant differences were found in the studied variables. Through the first year of follow up, 7 patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology 1987 criteria for RA, 2 patients developed giant cell arteritis, and 3 had associated malignancy. Patients who developed RA had statistically significantly increased presence of persistent synovitis and a smaller decrease in mean ESR after treatment with corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: Fifty-one percent of the patients with PMR presented distal musculoskeletal manifestations, with peripheral synovitis being the most frequent one. Patients with PMR with peripheral synovitis did not represent a high-risk subgroup with more severe disease. Seven patients who developed criteria for seronegative RA within the first year of follow up had presented statistically significant persistent synovitis compared with those who continued as PMR and also showed a smaller initial decrease in mean ESR after steroid treatment was initiated. The absence of persistent arthritis and the benign course of the arthritis permit the distinction of PMR from other inflammatory arthropathies.",M1

20197597,"[Giant cell arteritis - two cases with acute blindness]Giant cell arteritis is characterized primarily by inflammation in certain large and medium-sized arteries. The major risk factors are age, female gender and Northern European descent. In this report we describe two cases of acute vision loss due to giant cell arteritis. In both cases the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was below 50 mm/hr and the presenting complaint was foggy vision followed by acute blindness. The cases are to some extent different, for example in the former case the patient reported jaw claudication and ophthalmologic evaluation was consistent with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. In the latter case there was narrowing and box-carring of blood cells in retinal arterioles, consistent with occlusion of the central retinal artery. This patient had recently finished a 2-year long treatment with glucocorticosteroids for <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>. The retina and the optic nerve do not survive for long without perfusion. If giant cell arteritis causes blindness in one eye there is significant risk for the other eye to go blind if no treatment is given. Corticosteroids can spare the other eye and suppress the underlying inflammatory disease process as well. It is vital to confirm the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis with a biopsy and start corticosteroid treatment as soon as possible, even before the biopsy is taken.",M2

We have analyzed for the first time the association of 2 IRF5 gene variants in the susceptibility to giant cell arteritis (GCA). METHODS: Two hundred twenty patients with biopsy-proven GCA and 520 matched controls were assessed. DNA from patients and controls was obtained from peripheral blood. Samples were genotyped for the IRF5 rs2004640 and for the IRF5 CGGGG insertion/deletion polymorphism using a predesigned TaqMan allele discrimination assay and by polymerase chain reaction amplification, followed by an ABI3100 sequencer, respectively. RESULTS: A genotyping rate of 96% was achieved in this series of GCA patients. No significant differences were found in the genotype distribution between GCA patients and controls for both IRF5 gene variants. In this regard, similar genotype frequencies were found in GCA patients and controls. No significant differences were observed when GCA patients were stratified according to the presence of specific clinical features of the disease such as <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> or severe ischemic complications.

19593227,"Takayasu arteritis and giant cell arteritis: a spectrum within the same disease?Giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK) have been considered distinct disorders based on their clinical features, age of onset, and ethnic distribution. However, on closer examination, these disorders appear more similar than different. The histopathology of arterial lesions in these diseases may be indistinguishable. Imaging studies have revealed large vessel inflammation in at least 60% of patients with GCA. We questioned whether the distinctions between these diseases might in part be an artifact due to bias in gathering historical and physical data. We postulated that signs and symptoms of GCA and <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> occur in patients with TAK but have been under-reported as a result of this bias.We performed a retrospective review of 75 patients with TAK and 69 patients with GCA (per American College of Rheumatology criteria). Signs and symptoms attributable to disease within the year before and following diagnosis, treatment and interventional outcomes, and mortality were recorded using a standardized database. All cases were evaluated by a single physician, using identical history and physical examination forms for patients with both diseases.Patients were predominantly female (TAK 91%, GCA 82%) and white (TAK 88%, GCA 95%). New headache was a presenting symptom in 52% of TAK and in 70% of GCA patients. All TAK patients underwent vascular imaging studies and were demonstrated to have large vessel abnormalities. However, only a subset of patients with GCA (43/69, 62%) was similarly studied. Among this group, 73% of GCA patients had at least 1 arterial lesion identified. In both TAK and GCA, the most common sites of involvement were the aorta (TAK 77%, GCA 65%) and subclavian (TAK 65%, GCA 37%) arteries. Compared to patients with TAK, patients with GCA had a greater prevalence of jaw claudication (GCA 33%, TAK 5%), blurred vision (GCA 29%, TAK 8%), diplopia (GCA 9%, TAK 0%), and blindness (GCA 14%, TAK 0%).Symptoms, signs, and imaging abnormalities that are characteristic of GCA or TAK are often present, albeit in differing frequencies, in both disorders. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that these diseases may not be distinct entities, but represent skewed phenotypes within the spectrum of a single disorder. Differences in frequencies of manifestations may reflect a significant bias in how data are gathered for patients with each disease, as well as the influence of vascular and immunologic senescence.",M2

Samples were genotyped for STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in the allele frequencies for the STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism were observed between patients and controls. Although we observed an increased frequency of the T/T genotype in GCA patients (6.0%) compared to healthy controls (3.9%), this difference did not achieve statistical significance (OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.72-3.41). No statistically significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies were observed when patients were stratified according to the presence of typical disease features such as <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>, severe ischemic manifestations, and visual ischemic complications in the setting of this vasculitis.

19327614,"Epidemiological and clinical features of giant cell arteritis in Tunisia.BACKGROUND: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a systemic vasculitis of the elderly that could result in vision loss or even be life threatening. Unlike western countries, this disease is considered exceptional in Tunisia. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to determine epidemiological and clinical features of GCA in Tunisian population and to identify management difficulties. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicentric study of 96 patients in whom GCA was diagnosed between 1986 and 2003. All patients fulfilled the ACR criteria for classification of GCA. RESULTS: The majority of cases (77%) were diagnosed since 1994. The male/female ratio was 0.88 and the mean age at the time of diagnosis was 70.8+/-7.7 years. Clinical features were characterized by gradual onset in 64.4% of cases. The most frequent clinical manifestations were headache (91.7%), abnormalities in temporal arteries (85.4%), severe ischemic manifestations (80.2%), constitutional symptoms (75%), and <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (56.3%). Biological inflammatory syndrome was noted in all patients. Temporal artery biopsy established histological diagnosis in 73% of cases. All patients were treated by corticosteroids. Remission was obtained in 45.6%. Relapses occurred in 40.4% of cases and 30 patients were still receiving corticosteroids at the time of study. Four patients died and irreversible ischemic complications were noted in 15.6% of cases. Steroid adverse effects occurred in 56 patients. CONCLUSION: GCA is not exceptional to Tunisia.

19077714,"Imaging for large-vessel vasculitis.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ultrasonography, MRI, and PET are increasingly studied in large-vessel vasculitis. They have broadened our knowledge on these disorders and have a place in the diagnostic approach of these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Temporal artery ultrasonography can be used to guide the surgeon to that artery segment with the clearest 'halo' sign to perform a biopsy, or in experienced hands can even replace biopsy. The distal subclavian, axillary, and brachial arteries can also be examined. High-resolution MRI depicts superficial cranial and extracranial involvement patterns in giant cell arteritis (GCA). Contrast enhancement is prominent in active inflammation and decreases under successful steroid therapy. Presence of aortic complications such as aneurysm or dissection can be ruled out within the same investigation. Large thoracic vessel FDG-uptake is seen in the majority of patients with GCA, especially at the subclavian arteries and the aorta. FDG-PET cannot predict which patients are bound to relapse, and once steroids are started, interpretation is hazardous, which makes its role in follow-up uncertain. Increased thoracic aortic FDG-uptake at diagnosis of GCA may be a bad prognostic factor for later aortic dilatation. In patients with isolated <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> - who have less intense vascular FDG uptake - symptoms are caused by inflammation around the shoulders, hips, and spine. SUMMARY: Ultrasonography, MRI, and PET remain promising techniques in the scientific and clinical approach of large-vessel vasculitis.",M2

A case report.BACKGROUND: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) of the breast is one of the less recognized variants of this vasculitis and may represent an isolated finding or a manifestation of a more widespread disease. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 74-year-old woman with malaise and a 14-day persistent fever, reaching 38 degrees C. There was a bilateral, painless and mobile axillary lymphadenopathy and a slight tenderness over the medial and lateral upper quadrants of her left breast, as well as an independent palpable tender mass in the upper outer quadrant of the same breast measuring 2 cm in its greatest diameter. Constitutional symptoms, anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggestive of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> were also present. An invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast with coincidental pathologic findings of GCA in the same biopsy specimen was revealed. In this case, arteritis was limited to the breast and presented with diffuse breast tenderness. No other artery was involved by GCA.

18926062,"Giant cell arteritis presenting as facial swelling.Facial swelling is commonly ascribed to angioedema and a host of other causes. Temporal arteritis (TA), a disease most often diagnosed in patients over the age of 50 years, frequently presents with nonspecific and often ignored complaints (headache, symptoms of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>, low-grade fever, fever of unknown origin, loss of appetite, depression, joint pains, weight loss, hair loss, and even respiratory symptoms). The diagnosis of TA is highly likely in the presence of new-onset headaches, polymyalgia rheumatica, and a tender, cord-like, or swollen temporal artery. Facial swelling must be appreciated as another presentation of TA, especially when accompanied by other nonspecific symptoms. High clinical suspicion, immediate treatment, and definitive diagnosis by temporal artery biopsy are necessary to prevent the most severe vascular complications of blindness and cerebrovascular accidents. Treatment with corticosteroids is most often successful. Because this treatment is fraught with all the risks of high-dose and prolonged steroid therapy, it should only be initiated in cases of significant clinical suspicion, followed by a timely temporal artery biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Delay in therapy increases the risk of a vascular catastrophe. Delay in obtaining a temporal artery biopsy after therapy has been initiated decreases the diagnostic sensitivity of the test. Other modalities of immunosuppressive therapy remain either unsuccessful or unproven. Concomitant low-dose aspirin therapy appears to hold promise.",M2

18552581,"Giant cell arteritis presenting as a breast lesion: report of a case and review of the literature.Giant cell arteritis (GCA) mainly affects arteries arising from the external carotid arteries, although it may also be responsible for extracephalic clinical presentation related to impairment of vessels other than the carotids, such as the aorta as well arteries of the lower and upper limbs (10%-30% of cases). However, breast involvement is considered to be a rare complication of GCA. We recently observed a case of particular interest as the patient developed superficial mammary arteriolitis, bilaterally, revealing GCA with favorable outcome after institution of steroid therapy. Our case report reinforces the possibility of an unusual presentation of GCA. Indeed, we suggest that an evaluation for GCA affecting the breast should be made in elderly women exhibiting breast nodule(s)/mass(es) associated with other features of GCA (that are: headache, jaw claudication, constitutional signs, <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>). Furthermore, we also suggest that the prevalence of breast impairment may be underestimated in GCA as the breast is supplied mainly by 2 branches of the subclavian artery (ie, the internal mammary artery [as in the present case report] and the lateral thoracic artery), which is often involved in GCA.",M2

AIM: To help define the prognostic value of the presence of giant cells in temporal arteritis. METHODS: The clinical course of all patients with biopsy proven temporal arteritis from 1994 to 2004 was reviewed. The 92 patients were divided into those with giant cells (GC) (n = 76) seen on biopsy and those with no giant cells (NGC) (n = 16). Clinical findings were compared between groups. An additional analysis combined results with a previous study at the same institution to compare occurrence of blindness. RESULTS: The GC group had a higher proportion of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR) (36.8%) compared to the NGC group (12.5%) (p = 0.059). There was no significant difference in patient age, sex, sedimentation rate, or presenting symptoms.

When combining data with the previous study, in the GC group 21/109 (19%) developed blindness, while only 2/34 (6%) became blind in the NGC group (p = 0.11). CONCLUSION: The presence of giant cells is not a significant factor in determining treatment or clinical progression of temporal arteritis.

METHODS: One hundred forty patients with biopsy-proven GCA who were residents of Reggio Emilia, Italy, and 241 population-based healthy controls from the same geographic area were genotyped for the PlA1/A2 polymorphism of the platelet GPIIIa gene by molecular methods. The patients were divided into subgroups according to the presence or absence of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> and cranial ischemic complications. The distribution of the PlA1/A2 genotype was investigated, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.

METHODS: Retrospective study of a consecutive cohort of 78 patients clinically diagnosed and managed as GCA, who received corticosteroids before TAB. RESULTS: Among the 78 patients, TAB was positive in 57 (73%) and negative in 21 (27%). No significant differences in the length of the specimen were found between the positive and negative biopsies. We grouped patients according to treatment duration before TAB. In those with newly diagnosed GCA treated with high-dose steroid therapy, the biopsy results were positive in 78% (35/45) of patients treated for less than 2 weeks, in 65% of those treated for 2 to 4 weeks (13/20), and in 40% of those treated for more than 4 weeks (2/5). We also observed 8 patients that developed GCA on a background of a prior history of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR); in this group biopsy was positive in 88% of the cases, after a median duration of treatment of 180 +/- 172 days and an average daily dose of 7.1 +/- 1.4 mg/d. CONCLUSION: The performance of TAB should not delay the prompt institution of steroid therapy on diagnosis of GCA, since the diagnostic yield of TAB seems valuable within 4 weeks of starting high-dose steroid treatment. In patients that developed GCA on a background of a prior history of PMR, a late TAB is also generally informative despite long-term treatment with low doses of corticosteroids.",M2

We aimed to test the hypothesis that CDS can replace biopsy in the algorithm for the approach to diagnose GCA. Bilateral CDS was performed in consecutive patients older than 50 years with clinically suspected GCA, as well as in 15 age- and gender-matched control subjects with diabetes mellitus and/or stroke and 15 healthy subjects, to assess flow parameters and the possible presence of a dark halo around the arterial lumen. Unilateral temporal artery biopsy was then performed in patients with suspected GCA, which was directed to a particular arterial segment in case a halo was detected in CDS. Final diagnoses, after completion of a 3-month follow-up in 55 patients, included GCA (n = 22), <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (n = 12), polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's, and Adamantiades-Behçet's diseases (n = 3), and neoplastic (n = 8) and infectious diseases (n = 10). A dark halo of variable size (0.7-2.0 mm) around the vessel lumen was evident at baseline CDS in 21 patients (in 12 and 9 uni- or bilaterally, respectively) but in none of the controls. The presence of unilateral halo alone yielded 82% sensitivity and 91% specificity for GCA, whereas the specificity reached 100% when halos were found bilaterally. Blood-flow abnormal parameters (temporal artery diameter, peak systolic blood-flow velocities, stenoses, occlusions) were common in GCA and non-GCA patients, as well as in healthy and atherosclerotic disease-control, elderly subjects. At follow-up CDS examinations performed at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation of corticosteroid treatment for GCA, halos disappeared in all 18 patients (9 and 9, respectively). We conclude that CDS, an inexpensive, non-invasive, and easy-to-perform method, allows a directional biopsy that has an increased probability to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Biopsy is not necessary in a substantial proportion of patients in whom bilateral halo signs can be found by CDS.",M2
16682165,"Clinical presentation and vascular imaging in giant cell arteritis of the femoropopliteal and tibioperoneal arteries. Analysis of four cases.We present four patients with rapidly progressive claudication of the lower limbs due to extracranial giant cell arteritis. Additional findings suggestive of giant cell arteritis were involvement of the axillary or brachial arteries in two patients, symptoms of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> or temporal arteritis in three, and all patients had severely elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. Lower limb involvement affected preferentially the femoropopliteal, deep femoral, and tibioperoneal arteries. Hypoechogenic, concentric mural thickening suggestive of vasculitis was readily visible in all involved arterial segments by duplex ultrasound imaging, whereas angiography was rather unspecific. Typical changes for large-vessel vasculitis were also detectable by magnetic resonance imaging and fluorine-18-desoxyglucose positron emission tomography. More widespread use of these vascular imaging techniques may show that giant cell arteritis of the lower limbs is more frequent than previously assumed.",M2
16626432,"Giant cell arteritis.Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an immune-mediated vasculitis, affecting medium- to large-sized arteries, in individuals over the age of 50 years. Visual loss is a frequent complication of GCA, and once it occurs it tends to be both permanent and profound. Although major advances have been made in recent years in genetics, molecular biology and the description of the vessel wall morphology, the aetiology and pathogenesis of GCA are still incompletely understood. Over the years there has been much debate over whether <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> and GCA are separate or linked entities. Recent investigations support that polymyalgia rheumatica and GCA are two different expressions of the same underlying vasculitic disorder. A single cause or aetiological agent has not as yet been identified. Except for the histopathology of the arterial wall, there are no laboratory findings specific for GCA, and no particular signs or symptoms specific for the diagnosis. GCA typically causes vasculitis of the extracranial branches of the aorta and spares intracranial vessels. Transmural inflammation of the arteries induces luminal occlusion through intimal hyperplasia. Clinical symptoms reflect end-organ ischaemia. Branches of the external and internal carotid arteries are particularly susceptible. Corticosteroids remain the only proven treatment for GCA, the regimen initially involving high doses followed by a slow taper. However, early detection and treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is effective in preventing visual deterioration in most patients.",M2
16543040,"Fever of unknown origin: temporal arteritis presenting with persistent cough and elevated serum ferritin levels.BACKGROUND: Fever of unknown origin (FUO) at the present time is most frequently caused by neoplasm and less commonly by infection. Currently, collagen vascular diseases (CVDs) are an uncommon cause of FUO because most are readily diagnosable by serologic methods and do not remain undiagnosed for sufficient time to present as FUOs. CVDs presenting as FUOs not readily diagnosable with specific tests include late-onset rheumatoid arthritis, adult juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>/temporal arteritis (TA). TA, or giant cell arteritis, is an uncommon arteritis of the mid- and large-sized extracranial arteries of the head and neck and is a rare cause of FUO. TA is characterized by headache, scalp tenderness, jaw pain on chewing, and sudden loss of vision. Fever, anorexia, weight loss, and night sweats may also be present. With TA, respiratory symptoms occur in 9% and are the presenting feature in 4%. Laboratory abnormalities associated with TA include a highly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anemia, and thrombocytosis, and mildly increased alkaline phosphatase/serum transaminases. PATIENT: We present a patient with FUO caused by TA whose predominant presenting symptom was persistent cough that overshadowed head and neck symptoms of TA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of TA presenting as an FUO, with a highly elevated serum ferritin level. RESULTS: We conclude that highly elevated serum ferritin levels in patients with FUO should alert the clinician to consider TA in the differential diagnosis.",M2
16541271,"[Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis). Pathophysiology, immunology]The diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is established by temporal artery biopsy. The findings are those of a panarteritis with mononuclear infiltrates penetrating all layers of the arterial wall. Typically, activated T cells and macrophages are arranged in granulomas. Multinucleated giant cells, when present, are usually close to the fragmented internal elastic lamina. Often, the intimal layer is hyperplastic, leading to concentric occlusion of the lumen. The CD4(+) T cells are the main players in the disease process. T-cell activation in the arterial wall requires the presence of specialized antigen-presenting cells, the dendritic cells. The activation of monocytes and macrophages is responsible for the systemic inflammatory syndrome in giant cell arteritis and <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>. The blood vessel wall determines the site specificity of giant cell arteritis and provides the ground for the cell to cell interaction.",M2
16118730,"[Blindness in both eyes due to late diagnosis of giant cell arteritis]BACKGROUND: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is often diagnosed very late, variable  facets  of the disease exist render the diagnosis more difficult. METHODS/PATIENTS: Follow-up observations of five very old patients are reported in whom diagnosis was made too late, resulting in blindness of both eyes. RESULTS: Five patients (age 76-84 years, 4 women, one man) with GCA became blind in both eyes because diagnosis had been delayed (two patients) or onset of therapy was too late (three patients). In two patients who also had arterial hypertension, the symptom  headache  had been misleading. Symptoms of accompanying general diseases masked the real diagnosis, particularly in the second patient who had renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, and unilateral obstruction of the internal carotid artery. Symptoms that failed to lead to the correct diagnosis were: muscle or chewing pain (three patients), circumscribed numbness around the mouth (second patient), and persistent headache despite normalization of blood pressure. Normal findings from cranial CTAs (two patients) led to the wrong reassurance of the patient. Swelling of the optic disk (two patients) was misdiagnosed by ophthalmologists, as was a retinal branch arterial occlusion (first patient). Three patients, afraid of possible side effects caused by glucocorticoids, took ineffective alternative medications. Poor vigilance led to blindness of the fifth patient with long-standing <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted examinations at the onset of symptoms are necessary. GCA-symptoms were mis-constructed by additional diseases that disguised the correct diagnosis. The danger of bilateral blindness is particularly great in patients of great age.",M2
16078327,"Lack of association of a functional single nucleotide polymorphism of PTPN22, encoding lymphoid protein phosphatase, with susceptibility to biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis.OBJECTIVE: To assess the possible association between PTPN22 1858C(R)T polymorphism and susceptibility to giant cell arteritis (GCA) and to determine if this polymorphism is implicated in the clinical expression of this vasculitis. METHODS: Ninety-six patients with biopsy-proven GCA and 229 ethnically matched controls from the Lugo region of Northwest Spain were studied using molecular methods. All individuals were of Spanish Caucasian origin. Genotyping of PTPN22 gene 1858C(R)T polymorphism was performed by real time polymerase chain reaction technology, using TaqMan 5' allelic discrimination assay. RESULTS: No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies for PTPN22 polymorphism were observed between patients with GCA and controls or when patients were stratified by presence of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (n = 38) or severe ischemic manifestations (n = 47). CONCLUSION: Our results do not support potential involvement of PTPN22 gene polymorphism in the susceptibility or clinical expression of GCA.",M2
15857793,"What is the best approach to diagnosing large-vessel vasculitis?Temporal arteritis, including large-vessel giant cell arteritis, and Takayasu's arteritis are the two primary large-vessel vasculitides. Patients with temporal arteritis often present with headache, swollen temporal arteries, impairment of vision or symptoms of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>. Clinical examination includes palpation of the temporal arteries and radial pulses, auscultation of the subclavian and axillary region, and fundoscopy. The presence of jaw claudication, diplopia and temporal artery abnormalities correlates with a high probability of positive histology. Duplex ultrasonography of the temporal arteries delineates a characteristic hypoechoic, oedematous wall swelling, stenoses and occlusions. It detects the same pathologies in the axillary arteries and other arteries in large-vessel giant cell arteritis. Angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, electron beam computed tomography, computed tomography angiography and positron emission tomography show characteristic changes in the aorta and its primary branches in large-vessel giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis. Takayasu's arteritis often begins with diffuse symptoms such as low-grade fever, arthralgia, fatigue and weight loss. Clinical examination is important to detect bruits, pulse reduction and blood pressure differences. Profound experience exists with angiography. Other imaging methods are interesting alternatives as they are less invasive and may depict the inflammatory wall swelling.",M2
15854925,"Surgical treatment of ascending aortic aneurysms in patients with giant cell aortitis.BACKGROUND: Giant cell aortitis is a rare cause of ascending aortic aneurysm disease despite giant cell arteritis being a common cause of vasculitis. We evaluated an 8-year experience with surgical repair with regard to preoperative variables, extent of disease, required surgical procedures, and the propensity to develop additional great vessel aneurysms. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients (29 female, 8 male; aged 69.6 +/- 9.5 years) were operated on from 1995 to 2002. Ten (27%) patients had a history of steroid treatment for temporal arteritis or <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> 8.9 +/- 3.9 years before. Nineteen (51%) patients had +3 or +4 aortic regurgitation. Maximal aneurysm size was 6.1 +/- 0.8 cm. Thirty (81%) patients underwent polyethylene terephthalate fiber (Dacron) tube graft replacement of the ascending aorta, 4 (11%) had a modified Bentall procedure, 2 (5%) had a valve-sparing aortic root reconstruction, and 1 (3%) had aortorrhaphy. Twenty-two (59%) patients required 22 +/- 9 minutes of hypothermic circulatory arrest for hemiarch or complete aortic arch replacement. Twenty-six (70%) patients had concomitant cardiac procedures. RESULTS: There was no early mortality. Morbidity was reexploration for bleeding in 3 (8%) patients, stroke in 3 (8%), left vocal cord paralysis in 2 (5%), renal failure in 2 (5%), and gastrointestinal bleeding in 1 (3%). Mean follow-up was 2.8 +/- 2.3 years. Four-year actuarial survival was 74% (95% confidence interval, 57% to 94%). Other descending or abdominal aortic or great vessel aneurysms occurred in 17 (46%) patients. Four patients had prior aneurysm surgery, 8 are monitored with aneurysms, and 5 underwent repair of an aneurysm in the follow-up period. Of 8 late deaths, 3 were caused by complications of a descending thoracic aneurysm. No patient required replacement of a native aortic valve that was preserved during the initial operative procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Ascending aortic aneurysms caused by giant cell aortitis can involve the aorta from the aortic root through the aortic arch, thus requiring a tailored operative approach. The aortic valve tissue is spared from the pathologic process. Other aneurysms of the aorta and great vessels occur in nearly half of patients. Frequent surveillance of the remaining aorta is mandatory.",M2
15615251,"Is giant cell arteritis an infectious disease? Biological and epidemiological evidence.The etiology of giant cell arteritis and <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> remains unknown, although the HLA-DR4 group and the pre-existence of a degenerative vascular disease are confirmed risk factors. The incidence may vary between countries, but the North-South gradient should be considered with caution because of potential detection and collection bias. Infectious trigger factors have been looked for both at the epidemiological and biological level: annual, cyclic variations of incidence have been shown in Minnesota, seasonal variations in Scotland, France or Israel. The pre-existence of clinical, mainly respiratory, infection has been suggested in one study, but not confirmed afterwards. Simultaneous occurrence of peaks of GCA/PMR and respiratory infections have been observed in Denmark. Several viruses have been suspected as triggers and assessed by serological testing, PCR or immunostaining on temporal artery biopsies, or both techniques: the hepatitis B virus can be ruled out, as well as Herpes simplex 1 and 2, Herpes varicellae, Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus. Recent studies focused on parainfluenza virus, Parvovirus B19 and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Immunological studies suggest, at the origin of the inflammatory reaction leading to the typical pathological features of giant cell arteritis, the existence of a triggering antigen of unknown nature activating T-cells in the artery wall.",M2
15604899,"Use of ultrasonography and positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and assessment of large-vessel vasculitis.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ultrasonography and positron emission tomography have been increasingly studied and, in part, introduced in clinical practice to diagnose large-vessel vasculitides, such as temporal arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, large-vessel giant cell arteritis, and isolated aortitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Ultrasonography reveals characteristic homogenous, concentric wall thickening in vasculitis, often combined with stenoses and, less frequently, with acute occlusions. Thirteen studies describe sensitivities of 40 to 100% (median, 86%) for temporal artery vessel wall edema compared with histology, and of 35 to 86% (median, 70%) compared with clinical diagnosis. If wall edema, stenoses, and occlusions are included, sensitivities increase to 91 to 100% (median, 95%) compared with histology, and to 83 to 100% (median, 88%) compared with clinical diagnosis. Specificities for wall edema are 68 to 100% (median, 93%) compared with histology, and 78 to 100% (median, 97%) compared with clinical diagnosis. One should be aware of large-vessel giant cell arteritis in all patients with temporal arteritis and <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>. Ultrasonography reveals characteristic wall thickening, particularly of the distal subclavian, axillary, and proximal brachial arteries. Findings in Takayasu arteritis are similar, but the vessel wall swelling is usually brighter. Positron emission tomography reveals vasculitis in arteries with a diameter of more than 4 mm. Ultrasonography and positron emission tomography agreed completely in the anatomic distribution of changes in patients with large-vessel giant cell arteritis. It reveals asymptomatic large-vessel vasculitis in giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis. Positron emission tomography is not suitable for the assessment of temporal arteries. SUMMARY: Ultrasonography and positron emission tomography are new, promising techniques to assess large-vessel vasculitides.",M2
15511196,"[Analysis of a series of 55 patients with biopsy proven giant cell temporal arteritis]INTRODUCTION: Our main aim with this study is to establish the epidemiologic and clinical features, treatment response and complications of a group composed of 55 patients with biopsy proven temporal arteritis in a local hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study based on clinical records revision of patients diagnosed of giant cell arteritis (GCA) made by temporal artery biopsy between 1989 and 2001. RESULTS: The approximated annual incidence of GCA in our area is 4.1 cases per 100,000 persons over the age of 50. The mean age at diagnostic was 74 years and the 78,2% were women. The most common symptom at diagnostic was headache (81.5%) followed by systemic manifestations (74.1%) and later we found jaw claudication (32,7%), visual impairment (30.2%), isquemic manifestations (17%). <e>Polymyalgia rheumatica</e> was associated to GCA in 49.1% of cases. The temporal artery explorations was abnormal in the 76.9% of patients. The mean initial dose of corticoids was 69 mg prednisone per day, with a half dose reduction time of .5 months. In spite of that, 24,1% of patients relapsed during the first year. The 38% of patients did some complications during the corticosteroid treatment. The ESR was lower 50 mm in 12.7% of patients; it was anaemia in the 37.7% and thrombocytosis in 32,1%. In these last patients we detected a relation between thrombocytosis and specific visual impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of GCA in our area is low. The results of our series aren't different from others publicated before in clinical manifestations, there is a prevalence of female sex and there is a relation between specific visual impairment and the presence of thrombocytosis.",M2
14734523,"Activation of arterial wall dendritic cells and breakdown of self-tolerance in giant cell arteritis.Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a granulomatous and occlusive vasculitis that causes blindness, stroke, and aortic aneurysm. CD4(+) T cells are selectively activated in the adventitia of affected arteries. In human GCA artery-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse chimeras, depletion of CD83(+) dendritic cells (DCs) abrogated vasculitis, suggesting that DCs are critical antigen-presenting cells in GCA. Healthy medium-size arteries possessed an indigenous population of DCs at the adventitia-media border. Adoptive T cell transfer into temporal artery-SCID mouse chimeras demonstrated that DCs in healthy arteries were functionally immature, but gained T cell stimulatory capacity after injection of lipopolysaccharide. In patients with <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR), a subclinical variant of GCA, adventitial DCs were mature and produced the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, but vasculitic infiltrates were lacking. Human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen class II-matched healthy arteries, PMR arteries, and GCA arteries were coimplanted into SCID mice. Immature DCs in healthy arteries failed to stimulate T cells, but DCs in PMR arteries could attract, retain, and activate T cells that originated from the GCA lesions. We propose that in situ maturation of DCs in the adventitia is an early event in the pathogenesis of GCA. Activation of adventitial DCs initiates and maintains T cell responses in the artery and breaks tissue tolerance in the perivascular space.",M2
14673385,"Giant cell arteritis: strategies in diagnosis and treatment.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes current diagnostic assessments and therapeutic strategies in giant cell arteritis. Giant cell arteritis or temporal arteritis is a chronic vasculitis of large and medium-size vessels. Concurrent symptoms of proximal muscular ache and morning stiffness, <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>, are commonly seen. Recent investigations support the contention that polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis are two different expressions of the same underlying vasculitic disorder. RECENT FINDINGS: The symptomatology of giant cell arteritis is quite varying. Recently a frequent occurrence of audiovestibular manifestations was demonstrated, which should be actively searched for in the clinical investigation. Although color Doppler ultrasound, MRI, and positron emission tomography have illustrated the widespread nature of giant cell arteritis, none of these techniques may currently replace temporal artery biopsy. Biopsy of the superficial temporal artery is a safe and simple procedure, and remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. The importance of long biopsies and meticulous histologic examination using sub-serial sectioning is emphasized. Numerous recent publications confirm the low diagnostic yield of a second, contralateral biopsy. Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone in the treatment of giant cell arteritis. Although steroid treatment promptly eliminates symptoms of systemic inflammation, its effect on inflammatory morphology is delayed. Consequently, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies. The potential role of aspirin has recently been implicated.",M2

12910568,"Clinical and epidemiologic analysis of giant cell (temporal) arteritis from a nationwide survey in 1998 in Japan: the first government-supported nationwide survey.OBJECTIVE: To elucidate epidemiologic and clinical manifestations of Japanese patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA), the first nationwide survey for GCA was conducted in 1998 in Japan. METHODS: The first questionnaire on GCA for patients treated in 1997 was sent to 10,717 medical departments in Japan. A total of 177 patients were reported. Among the 177 patients, 66 GCA patients with detailed clinical and epidemiologic features on second survey were analyzed. RESULTS: Prevalence in patients 50 years of age and older in 1997 was 1.47 per 100,000 population in Japan. The average age at onset was 71.5 years old. The male:female ratio was 1:1.7. The association with permanent and complete visual loss (6.5%), jaw claudication (15.2%), and <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR) (30.3%) were low in frequency compared with those reported from other countries. All patients were treated with corticosteroids. Only 3 (4.5%) patients were reported as deceased due to other causes. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of GCA in Japan was revealed to be extremely low compared with other countries. Clinical findings of permanent and complete visual loss, jaw claudication, and PMR were infrequent among Japanese patients with GCA.",M2
12858456,"Influence of age, sex, and place of residence on clinical expression of giant cell arteritis in northwest Spain.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of giant cell arteritis (GCA), we examined whether differences in clinical and laboratory features exist in patients with biopsy-proven GCA from Northwest Spain according to sex, place of residence, and age at disease onset. METHODS: Retrospective study of biopsy-proven GCA diagnosed from January 1, 1981, to December 31, 2001, at the single hospital for a well defined population of 250,000. A comparative analysis was conducted of clinical and laboratory features according to sex, place of residence (rural or urban), and age at the onset of symptoms (&lt; 70 yrs; &gt;or= 70 yrs). RESULTS: Between 1981 and 2001, 210 patients from the Lugo region were diagnosed with biopsy-proven GCA. In urban areas GCA was significantly more common in women (rate ratio 1.58, 95% CI 1.00-2.53, p = 0.05). Women presented manifestations of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR) more commonly than men. However, no statistically significant difference in the frequency of visual manifestations or permanent visual loss were observed between the sexes. GCA was slightly more common in rural than in urban areas (annual adjusted incidence rate in rural areas 10.4/100,000 in people age &gt;or= 50 years vs 9.1/100,000 in urban areas; p = 0.34). GCA was more common among men in rural areas (rate ratio 1.73, 95% CI 1.10-2.70, p = 0.02). Patients younger than 70 years at the time of diagnosis (20%) had a trend to a longer delay to diagnosis and a marginal increase in the frequency of PMR compared with those with disease onset at age &gt;or= 70 years. A higher inflammatory response was observed in the patients younger than 70 years. CONCLUSION: In patients with biopsy-proven GCA from Northwest Spain PMR manifestations are more commonly observed in women. The higher inflammatory response and the longer delay to diagnosis in younger patients call for a higher physician awareness of this vasculitis among individuals younger than 70 years.",M2
12759711,"[Etiopathogenesis of giant cell arteritis]Giant cell arteritis is a vasculitis of large and medium size arteries, especially those of the aortic arch with an extracranial distribution, but also the aorta and some of its larger branches. It is characterised by the presence of mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates close to the internal elastic lamina formed by lymphocytes and macrophages, which in slightly more than 50% of the cases contain multinucleate giant cells. The morbidity associated with this disease is related to phenomena of distal ischemia to the luminal stenosis of the inflamed arteries, and to a lesser extent to the formation of aneurisms due to the weakening of the arterial wall. With an unknown aetiology, its pathogenesis is immune through the migration and location of gamma-INF -producing T cells in the adventitia of the inflamed arteries, it being assumed that this is the place of immune stimulation by a still unidentified antigen. The recruitment and activation of macrophages by this cytokine is one of the most important points of its pathogenesis. The destruction by these of the arterial elastic tissue is a relevant phenomenon, as is the production of other factors promoting neoangiogenesis and a proliferation of neointime, responsible through obliterating light for the ischemic manifestations of the disease. The process is accompanied by an important systemic repercussion characterised by a strong reaction of acute phase and general but barely specific symptoms of disease. On the other hand, an important percentage of patients show a clinical picture of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>, an entity that has a historical and controversial relationship to this arteritis.

To study the frequency and the characteristics of microscopic haematuria in GCA, we retrospectively studied 42 patients with biopsy-proven GCA, 39 patients with <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR) and 62 control patients &gt;or=60 years of age, admitted to the general internal medicine unit. Patients with pyuria, significant bacteriuria or a known haematuric disorder were excluded. Microscopic haematuria was defined as the presence of &gt;5 red blood cells (RBC) per high-power field (sediment counts) or of &gt;8 RBC/microl (direct counting). Microscopic haematuria was present at presentation in 47.6% of the GCA patients, versus 17.9% of the PMR patients (P = 0.005) and 21.0% of the control patients (P = 0.008). Urinary RBC were predominantly dysmorphic in all GCA patients in whom RBC morphology was assessed (n = 7). Presenting symptoms, renal function, arterial blood pressure and degree of leukocyturia did not differ significantly between GCA patients with or without haematuria. After the initiation of corticosteroid therapy, microscopic haematuria was no longer detectable in 25 of 35 GCA patients (71.4%). Microscopic haematuria of renal origin is frequent but generally benign in patients with GCA. Its presence, if unassociated with blood pressure elevation or renal function deterioration, helps to rule in rather than to rule out the diagnosis of GCA. In the typical setting invasive urologic and nephrologic work-up may not be warranted.",M2
12176811,"Reduction of jaw opening (trismus) in giant cell arteritis.OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and the clinical characterisation of jaw problems in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA). METHODS: the prevalence of such symptoms in patients with GCA was evaluated by performing a retrospective analysis of all patients with GCA and <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> who were diagnosed during admission to Hadassah University Hospital. Ten patients reported previously in the literature were also evaluated. RESULTS: Six patients out of 88 (6.8%) had complaints of reduction in jaw opening. These six patients seemed to have a much more abrupt onset of disease with shorter duration until diagnosis, higher prevalence of eye involvement (50% v 27%), and a higher rate of positive pathology (100%). CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in jaw opening in the appropriate setting may indicate the presence of GCA. This sign should not be overlooked in the presence of the claudication sign as it seems to reflect more severe GCA disease.",M2

METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study. Over 4 years, 16 centers from the International Network for the Study of Systemic Vasculitides enrolled patients with unequivocal GCA. The initial treatment was 1 mg/kg/day (&lt;or=60 mg every day) prednisone, plus either 0.15 mg/kg/week MTX (increased to 0.25 mg/kg/week, for a maximum weekly dosage of 15 mg) or placebo. Two physicians, both blinded to treatment allocation, evaluated each patient at every trial visit. One physician was responsible for providing global medical care. The other assessed GCA status according to a standard protocol. Treatment failure was defined as 2 distinct relapses or persistence of disease activity after the first relapse, in spite of increased CS therapy. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were enrolled. No significant differences between treatment groups were noted with regard to age, frequency of positive findings on temporal artery biopsy (placebo 87%, MTX 79%), or comorbidities at the time of enrollment. The median dosage of MTX was 15 mg/week. The incidence of treatment failure was comparable between groups after 12 months: 57.5% in the MTX group failed treatment (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 41.6-73.4%) compared with 77.3% in the placebo group (95% CI 61.9-92.8%) (P = 0.26). In a Cox regression analysis, MTX was not associated with a reduced risk of treatment failure (relative risk 0.72; 95% CI 0.41-1.28). There were no significant differences between groups with regard to abnormal elevations of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate following initial remissions, serious morbidity due to GCA, cumulative CS dose, or treatment toxicity. In the MTX group, there were fewer cases of GCA relapse heralded by symptoms of isolated <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (1 case versus 5 in the placebo group; P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this randomized, multicenter trial do not support the adjunctive use of MTX to control disease activity or to decrease the cumulative dose and toxicity of CS in patients with GCA.",M2
12052130,"Temporal arteritis: a cough, toothache, and tongue infarction.Temporal arteritis, the most common form of systemic vasculitis in adults, is a panarteritis that chiefly involves the extracranial branches of the carotid artery. The condition is illustrated in this article by the case of a 79-year-old woman with a dry cough, toothache, tongue infarction, and vision loss. The mean age of onset is 72 years and the disease rarely occurs in persons younger than 50 years. The most common presenting manifestations are headache, jaw claudication, <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>, and visual symptoms. Eighty-nine percent of patients have an erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 50 mm/h. However, about 40% of patients present with atypical manifestations, including fever of unknown origin, respiratory tract symptoms (especially dry cough), and large artery involvement. Familiarity with such unusual manifestations of temporal arteritis facilitates early diagnosis and treatment, thereby reducing the risk of vision loss.",M2

11790989,"Giant cell arteritis.Giant cell arteritis (GCA), the most common form of systemic vasculitis in adults, preferentially involves large and medium-sized arteries in patients over the age of 50. The classic manifestations are headache, jaw claudication, <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR), and visual symptoms, but 40% of patients present with a wide range of occult manifestations. Early diagnosis and treatment with prednisone can prevent blindness, the most feared complication of GCA. The pathogenesis of GCA is T-cell dependent and antigen driven. Clinical subsets of GCA appear to result from variable cytokine expression. The risk of developing thoracic aortic aneurysm is increased more than 17-fold in patients with GCA. GCA can also involve large arteries, especially the subclavian and axillary arteries. Color Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron-emission tomography scanning are providing insights into the extent and pathogenesis of the disease but have not replaced temporal artery biopsy as the gold standard for securing the diagnosis. Two recently completed double-blind, placebo-controlled trials concerning whether methotrexate plus prednisone is more effective than prednisone alone reached conflicting conclusions.",M2
11530032,"Risk factors for visual loss in giant cell (temporal) arteritis: a prospective study of 174 patients.OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors--especially the effects of thrombocytosis--for permanent visual loss in patients with temporal arteritis. METHODS: One hundred seventy-four patients with temporal arteritis (147 biopsy proven) were prospectively observed for the development of permanent visual loss. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine which of 17 pretreatment characteristics were associated with visual loss. RESULTS: Visual ischemic manifestations occurred in 48 (28%) patients, including permanent visual loss in 23 (13%) patients. The independent predictors associated with an increased risk of permanent visual loss were a history of transient visual ischemic symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 6.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4 to 29; P = 0.02) and a higher platelet count (OR = 3.7 per SD; 95% CI: 1.8 to 7.9; P = 0.001). The presence of constitutional symptoms (OR = 0.14; 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.77, P = 0.01), <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (OR = 0.04; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.48, P = 0.02), and C-reactive protein level (OR = 0.35 per SD; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.92, P = 0.03) were associated with a reduced risk. Upper limb artery involvement was excluded from the multivariate model, as no patients with that problem developed permanent visual loss. Of the 87 patients who presented with thrombocytosis (platelet count &gt;400 x 10(9)/L), 32 (37%) developed ischemic visual symptoms, compared with 16 (18%) of those without thrombocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated platelet count is a risk factor for permanent visual loss in temporal arteritis. The finding of thrombocytosis in a patient with suspected temporal arteritis should emphasize the need for urgent treatment, with consideration of using inhibitors of platelet aggregation or anticoagulation therapy.",M2

11218296,"[Risk factors for irreversible cerebral ischemia complications from Horton's disease: prospective study of 178 patients]PURPOSE: To search for risk factors of developing irreversible cranial ischemic complications (ICIC) in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and to explore whether two subsets of patients (high risk and low risk of developing ICIC) can be defined. METHODS: One-hundred seventy-eight consecutive patients with temporal arteritis (149 biopsy-proven) were diagnosed and followed up in a department of Internal Medicine between 1976 and 1999. The patients were separated into two groups, according to the presence or absence of ICIC, with comparison of 17 clinical and biological parameters prospectively recorded for each patient using a pre-established comprehensive questionnaire. RESULTS: ICIC occurred in 25 patients (14%), with amaurosis in 22 cases. Suggestive symptoms and/or signs of temporal arteritis were present in 92% of the patients, lasting 50 days (median) before the onset of ICIC. Forty-three patients (24%) complained of transient visual ischemic symptoms (TVIS), which preceded acute blindness in 11 cases. A multivariate logistic regression, from which 28 cases with upper limb artery involvement were excluded for technical reasons (no CCII in any case, thus predicting perfectly the lack of ischemic risk, P = 0.02), indicated that the only independent variables associated with the ischemic risk were: a history of TVIS (P = 0.05), the lack of signs of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR; P = 0.02), lower blood levels of fibrinogen (P = 0.024) and higher mean blood platelets levels (P = 0.006). However, these five variables predicted only 30% of the variability of the model. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the model reached respectively 36, 96, 64 and 88%. Overall, 86% of the cases were correctly classified with respect to the ischemic risk. CONCLUSION: The rate of ICIC should be reduced by an earlier recognition of the usual signs of temporal arteritis. Several independent risk factors of ICIC have been identified. However, the logistic model failed to predict accurately the ischemic risk in 14% of the cases, indicating that as yet unrecognised factors probably exist that play a role in the occurrence of ICIC. Nevertheless, regarding the strong association between platelet levels and ICIC, patients with thrombocytosis should receive initially both corticosteroids and antiplatelet agents.",M2
11182025,"Biopsy-negative giant cell arteritis: clinical spectrum and predictive factors for positive temporal artery biopsy.OBJECTIVES: To examine the frequency and features of patients with biopsy-negative giant cell arteritis (GCA), establish differences with biopsy-proven GCA, and identify the optimal set of predictors for a positive temporal artery biopsy (TAB) in patients with GCA. METHODS: Retrospective study of an unselected population of patients with GCA diagnosed at the reference hospital for a defined population between 1981 and 1998. Patients were classified into biopsy-proven GCA if a TAB was positive for GCA, or biopsy-negative GCA if they fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of GCA (Hunder GG, et al Arthritis Rheum 1990; 33:1122-8) despite having a negative TAB. RESULTS: One hundred ninety Caucasian patients were diagnosed with GCA. Twenty-nine of them (15.3%) had a negative TAB. In these biopsy-negative patients, headache and <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> were frequent presenting symptoms. In contrast, jaw claudication, abnormal temporal artery on physical examination, and constitutional syndrome (asthenia, anorexia, and weight loss of 4 kg or more) were less common. They also had lower biologic markers of inflammation. The best predictive model of biopsy-proven GCA included a history of constitutional syndrome (OR = 6.1), an abnormal temporal artery on physical examination (OR = 3.2), and the presence of visual complications (OR = 4.9). CONCLUSIONS: In GCA, a subset of patients have a high likelihood of having a negative TAB. This subset seems to have less severe ischemic complications than that of biopsy-proven GCA. In patients without visual manifestations, abnormal temporal artery on examination or constitutional syndrome the risk of having an abnormal TAB is low.",M2
11103864,"Temporal arteritis and fever: report of a case and a clinical reanalysis of 360 cases.The purposes of this article are to report a case with temporal arteritis (TA) and to summarize and reanalyze the cases of temporal arteritis associated with fever in published articles for understanding better the clinical features of TA. A case with biopsy-proven TA is reported. The publications with TA and fever were searched by using MEDLINE in English from 1966 to 1999. Three hundred sixty cases of temporal arteritis associated with fever were reanalyzed. The results showed that a case of biopsy-proven TA with typically clinical manifestation was initially misdiagnosed and that the reanalysis of 360 cases revealed that the common clinical findings at presentation were abnormal temporal arteries, headache, low fever, loss of weight, <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>, jaw claudication, vision disorder, arthralgis or myalyias, and ear pain and that the uncommon clinical findings at presentation were high fever, malaise, anorexia, breast pain, transient ischemic attack/stroke, cough, mental disorder, diarrhea, and uterine prolapse, etc. Laboratory findings were the range of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 14 to 149 with a mean of 97.0 mm/hr, white blood cells being normal or increased in the range of 10.9 to 22.9 x 10(9)/L, hemoglobin level 7 to 16 g/dL, the platelets count increased to 785 x 10(9)/L, and microscopic hematuria. The diagnosis was made by a combination of clinical features, an increased ESR, a response to steroids, and, most specifically, temporal artery biopsy. The initial diagnosis was misdiagnosed in 38.2% of patients. In conclusion, the features of TA associated with fever have not been widely appreciated yet. TA is a common cause of fever of unknown origin (FUO) in the elderly. TA should be considered when patients complain of common and uncommon manifestations. An elevated ESR will aid in the diagnosis of TA, and temporal artery biopsy will provide certainty.",M2
11072651,"[Headache due to temporal arteritis]Pain associated with geant cell arteritis (GCA) is typically continuous, with exacerbations that often occur at night. Contact is painful and can precipitate an exacerbation of pain lasting several hours. The superficial temporal artery is the most common target of GCA but symptoms vary according to the predominant site of arterial inflammation. As a result, GCA can present in different ways with headaches being mild or absent in some patients. In nearly 40% of patients with biopsy-documented GCA, palpation of the branches of the external carotid artery fails to demonstrate any abnormalities. This arteritis affects the aortic arch and all its branches giving rise to a broad range of neurologic symptoms, for example, ocular disease, ischemic stroke, aortic dissection, etc. About 30% of patients also have symptoms of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>. Demonstration of an inflammatory syndrome is important and temporal artery biopsy is the last element of the diagnostic. In some locations of the GCA angiography is useful. Treatment, commonly including corticosteroids, should be initiated as early as possible. Prevention of osteoporosis should be initiated especially in elderly subjects. In some cases other treatments are useful anticoagulants, immunosuppressive therapies, dapsone.",M2

10655758,"[The significance of color duplex ultrasonography for the diagnosis of temporal arteritis]We examined the usefulness of color duplex ultrasonography in patients suspected of having temporal arteritis. Five patients, who were all aged 70 or older, developed a new onset of localized headache with temporal artery abnormalities, and had an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of &gt; 100 mm/hour. The final diagnoses were temporal arteritis in three patients, <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> in one, and probable healed temporal arteritis in one. Color duplex ultrasonography showed stenoses, which were confirmed histologically as well, in the superficial temporal artery of all patients. The characteristic findings of active temporal arteritis were, however, demonstrated in only three biopsy specimens, and in the remaining two the stenoses were thought to be related to previous arteritis. The hypoechoic halo, which has been reported to be a characteristic finding of color duplex ultrasonography in active temporal arteritis, was detected in only one patient with active temporal arteritis and another one with probable healed temporal arteritis. No stenoses were demonstrated in the superficial temporal arteries of 30 control subjects (20 with at least one risk factor of atherosclerosis and 10 without it). Color duplex ultrasonography can therefore be considered a powerful method for detecting stenoses in the superficial temporal artery. Its ability to identify their etiology is, however, unsatisfactory, so that temporal artery biopsy remains undoubtedly the most reliable test for etiological evaluation. We thus recommend color duplex ultrasonography as a supplementary method for the diagnosis of temporal arteritis, because it can provide useful information concerning the appropriate site of temporal artery biopsy.",M2
10652747,"[Giant cell arteritis, bilateral anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and anticardiolipin antibodies]CLINICAL CASE: We report a case of giant cell arteritis (GCA) that developed acute bilateral amaurosis secondary to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), without other symptoms and with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Physical examination revealed painless and pulseless temporal arteries, ophthalmoscopic findings were blurring of margins, hyperaemia and elevation of both optic discs. Visual acuity was limited to hand motion perception and light-darkness discrimination. Six months before of this syndrome, the patient was diagnosed of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> and was maintained asymptomatic with 6 mg/day of deflazacort. Temporal artery biopsy was diagnostic. An elevated IgG type anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) rate was detected in serum. The remaining laboratory studies were normal. CONCLUSIONS: In old people with uni or bilateral acute visual loss, even with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and without other symptoms associated, it is necessary to have a high index of suspicion in order to detect giant cell arteritis. This can facilitate an early diagnosis and immediate initiation of treatment with high doses of corticosteroids. An elevated level of IgG type anticardiolipin antibodies may be a risk factor to thrombotic complications, as anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, in patients with giant cell arteritis.",M2
10616010,"YKL-40 in giant cells and macrophages from patients with giant cell arteritis.OBJECTIVE: YKL-40, a mammalian member of the family 18 glycosyl hydrolases, is secreted by activated macrophages at a late stage of differentiation. Macrophages are present in inflammation of the arterial wall and are thought to participate in the pathogenesis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether macrophages and giant cells of patients with GCA produce YKL-40, and whether serum YKL-40 concentrations are elevated in these patients. METHODS: Serum YKL-40 was determined by radioimmunoassay in 19 patients with GCA and 8 patients with <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR) who were followed up prospectively during 1 year of treatment with prednisolone. Immunohistochemical staining for YKL-40 was performed in temporal artery biopsy samples that were obtained before treatment. RESULTS: In the arteritic vessels of patients with GCA, positive staining for the YKL-40 antigen was found in CD68+ giant cells and mononuclear cells located in the media. Macrophages located in the adventitia and intima were negative for YKL-40. At the time of diagnosis, patients with GCA had an increased median serum level of YKL-40 (256 microg/liter; P&lt;0.01) compared with healthy age-matched controls (median 118 microg/liter), and the serum level of YKL-40 decreased to normal levels during prednisolone treatment (-38% after 1 month; P&lt;0.001). Most patients with PMR had normal serum YKL-40 levels (median 158 microg/liter) and had no changes in the serum YKL-40 levels during prednisolone treatment. The observed changes in serum YKL-40 did not always parallel the changes in serum C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate during the 1-year study period. CONCLUSION: YKL-40 is found in CD68+ giant cells and mononuclear cells in the media of arteritic vessels of patients with GCA, and the concentration of serum YKL-40 may reflect the local activity of these cells in the inflamed artery.",M2
10606387,"Secondary amyloidosis associated with giant cell arteritis/<e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>.Although giant cell arteritis (GCA) is characterized by chronic inflammation, secondary (AA) amyloidosis appears to be an exceptionally rare complication of this disorder. We describe an 84-year-old man with biopsy proven GCA and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) who was found at autopsy to have AA amyloid deposition in numerous organs, 9 years after his diagnosis of GCA. Persistent musculoskeletal symptoms, attributed to refractory PMR during the patient's life, were likely due to AA amyloidosis. This unrecognized complication of GCA/PMR confounded his therapy, leading to excessive treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate. This case shows that the occurrence of AA amyloidosis should be considered in patients with  refractory PMR  developing after a period of treatment, and that autopsies play a vital role in enigmatic cases.",M2

METHODS: The records of 128 patients with GCA diagnosed over a 42-year-period (1950-1991) in Olmsted County, MN, were reviewed for the presence and type of musculoskeletal manifestations, their relationship to the onset and course of GCA, and their response to treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (41%) developed <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>: 23 before, 17 concurrently with, and 13 after the diagnosis of GCA. Thirty patients (23%) developed 1 or more peripheral musculoskeletal manifestations. These included peripheral synovitis in 23 patients (6 of whom fulfilled criteria for rheumatoid arthritis), distal extremity swelling with pitting edema in 13, distal swelling without pitting in 5, tenosynovitis in 6, and carpal tunnel syndrome in 2. Fifty-seven episodes of peripheral manifestations occurred in the 30 patients at different times during the course of GCA. In most, the onset of PMR and peripheral manifestations was within 2 years of the diagnosis of GCA. CONCLUSION: Musculoskeletal symptoms in GCA are common and varied. Most appear linked temporally to the underlying GCA, indicating that the nature of this illness and its clinical expression are broader than often considered.",M2

Steroid-related toxicity and needs for alternative therapeutic regimens in patients experiencing recurrent active or steroid-resistant diseases, are the main reasons for searching a steroid-sparing agent. Regarding disease pathogenesis, immunosuppressive agents might be useful drugs. Methotrexate is the most widely studied agent in this indication. However, available data are incomplete and studies have included only <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> or both polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis affected patients. Results of these studies evoke the possibility of using methotrexate in steroid-dependent or resistant diseases, as well as a steroid-sparing agent in order to taper off and stop steroids quickly; with an acceptable toxicity. Azathioprine may be used to control steroid-dependant or resistant diseases, but toxicity appears to be higher. An open prospective study compared azathioprine and methotrexate and concluded to the superiority of methotrexate. Available data concerning cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine A are too incomplete. A satisfactory steroid-sparing agent in giant cell arteritis is still unknown. Currently, methotrexate, and probably azathioprine, appear to be the most useful agents in this indication.

METHODS: Four hundred new patients with GCA or <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR) and population-based, individually age- and sex-matched controls were included in this multicenter, prospective case-control study. Each participant was evaluated by review of the medical history and by clinical and laboratory assessments. RESULTS: Among women, smoking was associated with a 6-fold increase in risk (P = 0.00006, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2-17), heavy smoking with a 17-fold increase in risk, and previous atheromatous disease with a 4.5-fold increase in risk (P = 0.0003, 95% CI 2-11) of GCA in both the biopsy-positive and biopsy-negative GCA groups; only smoking appeared to be a risk factor for PMR in women (odds ratio 3.64, 95% CI 1.07-12.40). Among men, no risk factor was found to be significant. CONCLUSION: Smoking and previous arterial disease were independently associated with GCA in women.

METHODS: The National Arthritis Data Workgroup reviewed data from available surveys, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey series. For overall national estimates, we used surveys based on representative samples. Because data based on national population samples are unavailable for most specific musculoskeletal conditions, we derived data from various smaller survey samples from defined populations. Prevalence estimates from these surveys were linked to 1990 US Bureau of the Census population data to calculate national estimates. We also estimated the expected frequency of arthritis in the year 2020. RESULTS: Current national estimates are provided, with important caveats regarding their interpretation, for self-reported arthritis and selected conditions. An estimated 15% (40 million) of Americans had some form of arthritis in 1995. By the year 2020, an estimated 18.2% (59.4 million) will be affected. CONCLUSION: Given the limitations of the data on which they are based, this report provides the best available prevalence estimates for arthritis and other rheumatic conditions overall, and for selected musculoskeletal disorders, in the US population.",M2

9448986,"Large vessel vasculitides.During the past few years remarkable progress has been achieved in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms leading to vascular inflammation and injury in giant cell (temporal) arteritis. T lymphocytes are activated by specific recognition of a putative antigen residing in the arterial wall and, subsequently, activate macrophages that undergo a functional differentiation and contribute to vessel damage through various pathways. Vascular response to inflammation amplifies the inflammatory response through neovascularization and adhesion molecule expression. We are beginning to appreciate that products released by infiltrating inflammatory cells may play an important role in vessel occlusion and resulting ischemic complications. Concomitantly, synovitis underlying <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> musculoskeletal symptoms has been immunopathologically characterized and the nature of its relationship to giant cell arteritis is discussed. Although some components of the disease are highly corticosteroid responsive, other underlying pathogenic mechanisms may remain active. Long-term outcome is heterogeneous in patients with giant cell arteritis. Much less is known about the pathogenesis of Takayasu's arteritis. Recent work supports its association with HLA class I antigens, which may differ in different geographic areas or ethnic groups. Because Takayasu's disease expression may vary in different ethnic settings, this possibility has led to the proposal of new diagnostic criteria.

Histology revealed a segmental arteritis of small, medium and some quite large myometrial arteries with extensive destruction of both internal and external elastic laminae. Multinucleate giant cells, lymphocytes and histiocytes were most prominent in the inflammatory infiltrate. The findings in this case are compared with previous reports. In a review of the literature it was found that almost one third of cases presented with generalised symptoms such as fever, anemia, fatigue and weight loss. The symptoms were not immediately recognised as temporal arteritis or polymyalgia rheumatica. On routine physical examination or radiological investigation, benign gynecological pathology such as a simple ovarian cyst or uterine leiomyoma were found. The subsequent unexpected discovery of GCA on histological examination was the critical event in alerting clinicians to the diagnosis of temporal arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatica. Without exception steroid therapy was successful in achieving relief of generalised symptoms.",M2

Elastolysis by multinucleated giant cells has also been reported. We investigated elastin derived peptides as putative recall antigens for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with GCA. METHODS: PBMC were collected from 17 patients with GCA (Group 1), 17 patients with vascular diseases, connective tissue diseases, or <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> without GCA (Group 2), and 17 healthy controls (Group 3). Cultures of PBMC with different elastin derived peptides or elastase were analyzed. RESULTS: A proliferative response was obtained only with elastate derived elastin peptides in 12/13 untreated patients with GCA. Steroid treatment was believed to abolish this proliferative response in 4 patients with GCA. PBMC from only 3/34 non-GCA subjects responded to these antigens. No proliferative response was obtained for other elastin derived peptides or elastase in any subject. CONCLUSION: Degradation of native elastin by leukocyte elastase can provide elastin derived peptides that act as autoimmune targets for T cells in GCA.",M2

9008596,"Disease patterns and tissue cytokine profiles in giant cell arteritis.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clinical heterogeneity in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) is correlated with different patterns in the tissue-specific inflammatory response. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with typical histomorphologic findings of GCA were grouped according to the presence or absence of jaw claudication and/or visual abnormalities, fever, concomitant <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR), and histologic evidence of giant cell formation. The inflammatory response in temporal artery biopsy specimens was characterized by semiquantification of cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, followed by oligonucleotide hybridization with cytokine-specific probes. Clinical patterns were then correlated with profiles of tissue cytokines. RESULTS: Inflammatory cytokines were expressed in all temporal artery tissues. In situ synthesis of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), and IL-1 beta mRNA, but not of IL-10 and IL-12 mRNA, distinguished different patterns of inflammation, and these patterns correlated with clinical manifestations of the disease. Patients with evidence of ischemic symptoms, indicated by jaw claudication and/or visual symptoms, typically expressed higher concentrations of IFN gamma mRNA (P = 0.008) and IL-1 beta mRNA (P = 0.02). Presence of fever was correlated with lower copy numbers of IFN gamma (P = 0.02). Formation of giant cells in the granulomatous infiltrates was associated with the local synthesis of IFN gamma mRNA (P = 0.003). Tissue from GCA patients with concomitant PMR contained higher levels of IL-2 mRNA transcripts (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Variations in the clinical presentation of GCA were correlated with cytokine mRNA expression in the affected temporal arteries. Differences in the effector functions of tissue-infiltrating T cells distinguished disease patterns in which either local ischemic symptoms or systemic involvement was dominant, or in which there was co-occurrence of PMR. Definition of different patterns of inflammation in GCA might, therefore, facilitate the design of differentiated therapeutic approaches.",M2
8923368,"Clinical manifestations of temporal arteritis: a report from Israel.OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical manifestations of 39 patients with temporal (giant cell) arteritis (GCA), allocated during a 10 year period in the largest medical center in Israel. METHODS: The patients were included in the analysis if they fulfilled the new American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria for the diagnosis of GCA. Patients were divided into biopsy-proven (30 patients) and biopsy-negative (9 patients) groups, and their clinical manifestations were compared using Student's t test for comparison of continuous variables, and Fisher's exact test for comparison of proportions. RESULTS: The most common presenting symptoms of the patients with TA included headache (87% of the biopsy-proven patients), fever (64%), visual abnormalities (41%), and <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR) or weight loss (20% each). Pulmonary involvement occurred in 5 patients. Ten percent of the biopsy-proven patients presented with occult presentation. Analysis of biopsy-proven and biopsy-negative groups revealed the feasibility of making the diagnosis of temporal arteritis on the basis of simple clinical variables, even without a positive biopsy, as the 2 groups of patients had comparable manifestations. However, the biopsy-proven group was older, included more males and presented significantly more with fever, compared to the biopsy-negative patients. Moreover, although not reaching statistical significance, the biopsy-proven patients tended to have more systemic and extracranial symptoms, including pulmonary manifestations. CONCLUSION: Compared to a previous report from Israel on patients with temporal arteritis, almost 2 decades ago, our data suggest that the incidence of the disease in Israel has increased, whereas the ethnic distribution has not changed.",M2

8711631,"[Vasculitis]Vasculitis, restricted to the central nervous system, may be an iodiopathic disorder or may be secondary to toxins, infections or neoplasm. Alternatively, it may be part of a systemic autoimmune disease. Temporal arteritis presents with headache, jay claudication, <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> and constitutional symptoms. Hemispheric strokes occur in 10%, especially in the territory supplied by the posterior or the middle cerebral arteries. Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice. Isolated angitis of the central nervous system is an idiopathic recurrent inflammatory disease of the small and medium-sized vessels, confirmed to the brain and the spinal cord. Persisting headaches, encephalopathy with personality changes, cognitive disorders and memory disturbances as well as multifocal neurologic deficits resulting from recurrent cerebral ischemia and cranial nerve involvement are the most frequent presently symptoms of the disease. Angiography of the intracranial vessels presents segmental stenoses or dilatations of the medium and small vessels; a leptomeningeal biopsy demonstrating vasculitis is the only reliable diagnostic method. Treatment is instituted with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. At least one year of therapy is necessary. The typical dermatological manifestations of Behçet's disease are aphthous stomatitis, genital ulcerations and ocular inflammation. Neurological involvement has been described in 30% of all patients with Behçhet's disease. Sinus thrombosis presents with the signs of intracranial hypertension. A meningoencephalitis with headaches, disturbances of consciousness and focal neurologic symptoms is frequent; spinal cord involvement occurs. The treatment of choice for Behçet's disease consists of steroids in combination with chlorambucil or azathioprine. While polyarteritis nodosa and the Churg-Strauss syndrome most frequently involve the peripheral nervous system. CNS involvement is encountered in Wegener's granulomatosis. In lupus erythematosus and Sjorgren's syndrome, cerebral symptoms are rarely caused by a true vasculitis. In lupus erythematosus, nervous system involvement has been attributed to autoantibodies which interact directly with neurons [antineuronal antibodies] or indirectly lead to thrombotic vasculopathy by influencing the coagulation system [antiphospholipid antibodies].",M2
8651526,"Temporal arteritis: diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.Background: Giant cell arteritis of surgical significance includes two clinical entities, temporal arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis, and they are pathologically indistinguishable from one another. This study summarizes our experience in 21 cases of temporal arteritis during a recent 5-year period. Patient Population and Results: This study includes patients who were discharged with a clinical diagnosis of temporal arteritis. There were 12 women and 9 men, with a mean age of 69 years. Six patients were admitted with an initial diagnosis of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>, nine with severe headache and/or nonspecific symptoms, three with ischemic symptoms of the limbs, one with a cerebrovascular accident, one with syncope, and one with osteomyelitis of the limb. The sedimentation rate ranged from 26 to 110, with a mean of 41. Eight patients had a preoperative duplex ultrasound of their temporal arteries; six of these had a peak systolic velocity of 2 &gt; or = 200 cm/s, and five had a positive temporal artery biopsy. Nineteen patients had temporal artery biopsies, 15 were positive for giant cell arteritis, and the diagnosis was not conclusive in 4. All patients were treated with prednisone with a satisfactory outcome, except for two who had ischemic symptoms of the upper extremity requiring a carotid-axillary artery bypass in one and a carotid-brachial artery bypass in the other. Both patients had satisfactory outcomes after surgery. Conclusions: The primary treatment of temporal arteritis is medical, and surgery should be reserved for severe specific disabling symptoms that have failed medical therapy. Duplex ultrasound might be helpful in predicting the side and location for temporal artery biopsy.",M2

Angina, which appeared a few days after diagnosis, was coupled with electrocardiographic alterations, which did not seem sensitive to nitrates but went back when steroid at full dose was added. The patient was also affected by Basedow disease, which was present during the whole course of the vasculitis. Furthermore islet-cell antibodies (ICA) were present. HLA typing showed the presence of the B8, DR3 haplotype. The patient died after 22 months from the diagnosis of digestive hemorrhage, probably favoured by extended cortisone therapy, while signs of arteritis were still evident.",M2
9033741,"[Aortitis in Horton disease. Review of the literature]First described in 1937, giant cell aortitis (aortitis associated with giant cell arteritis) occurs in 20 to 40% of patients with giant cell arteritis and is often clinically silent. Temporal involvement usually precedes aortic involvement. The process may involve the entire aorta, but complications are usually related to thoracic involvement. Patients with giant cell aortitis may be asymptomatic, or present with aortic arch syndrome, dilation of the aorta, aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, sudden rupture of the aorta, or aortic valve incompetence. Thoracic aneurysms are usually fusiform and can be complicated by dissection in up to 50% of patients. Aortic involvement may be the presenting feature of giant cell arteritis: it may also occur in patients with preexisting temporal arteritis, often when corticosteroid therapy is reduced or discontinued. Aortic rupture complicating aortitis may be the cause of death in 3-12% of patients with giant cell arteritis. Clinical follow-up with assessment of disease activity by chest X-ray and biological markers of inflammation should be performed yearly in giant cell arteritis. Aortic involvement should be suspected if cardiac or vascular echo-Doppler shows evidence of an aortic arch syndrome, aortic dilation, aneurysm, or of aortic valve incompetence. Corticosteroid therapy, beginning with a dose of 1 mg/kg/day remains the key point of therapy. The dose is subsequently adjusted based on the clinical course and the results of ancillary tests. This treatment might prevent fatal outcome with aortic rupture. Long-term follow-up of all patients with giant cell arteritis or <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> is essential, as complications may develop late in the course of the disease.",M2
9098251,"Cotton-wool spots and the early diagnosis of giant cell arteritis.BACKGROUND: Giant cell arteritis is a common cause of severe visual loss in older individuals. Patients often present to the ophthalmologist having already lost vision in one eye. Detection of early ophthalmoscopic signs that precede irreversible visual loss in giant cell arteritis would allow preventative treatment in an otherwise frequently blinding disease. METHODS: Case presentations. RESULTS: Seven patients with mild visual symptoms and results of an ophthalmologic examination significant for cotton-wool spots were found to have giant cell arteritis. On specific questioning, six of seven patients described constitutional symptoms consistent with giant cell arteritis. Six patients had an abnormally elevated Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Temporal artery biopsy confirmed giant cell arteritis in six patients. The seventh patient received a diagnosis of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>. Prompt treatment with corticosteroids led to preservation of vision and uneventful resolution of the cotton-wool spots in all seven patients. CONCLUSION: Cotton-wool spots are an early ophthalmoscopic finding in giant cell arteritis and can precede severe visual loss. Recognition of the significance of cotton-wool spots, use of laboratory studies, and prompt treatment may preserve vision in an otherwise frequently blinding disease.",M2
8592735,"Giant cell arteritis as an antigen-driven disease.Emerging data support the model that giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an antigen-driven disease. Select helper T cells are recruited to the vascular lesions where they produce a defined pattern of cytokines. At least two functionally distinct populations of macrophages are involved and macrophage activation extends into the compartment of circulating phagocytes. Searches for the antigen may be facilitated through structural analysis of specially activated T lymphocytes in the lesions. In addition to the proposed disease-inducing agent, genetic risk factors are important. One of the genetic elements has been mapped to the HLA-DR region and seems to encode parts of a pocket in the HLA-DR molecule, accommodating side chains of the interacting antigenic peptide. On the molecular level, some but not all pathomechanisms are shared by <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> and GCA, indicating that both syndromes form a spectrum of disease.",M2

7667646,"Aortic and extracranial large vessel giant cell arteritis: a review of 72 cases with histopathologic documentation.Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is closely identified with the temporal arteritis-<e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> syndrome of the elderly. It is also a systemic disease that can cripple and kill. Up to 15% of patients with temporal arteritis may have angiographic evidence of extracranial GCA, and aortic insufficiency, ruptured aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, stroke, or myocardial infarction may be the initial manifestation of systemic GCA. A review of 72 cases of aortic and extracranial GCA, all with histopathologic verification of the disease, revealed that 25% of patients with aortic and extracranial large-vessel GCA had asymptomatic temporal arteritis; the ascending aorta and aortic arch were most frequently involved (39%), followed by the subclavian and axillary arteries (26%), and the femoropopliteal arteries (18%). Nine patients (12.5%) underwent an upper or lower limb amputation. Of the 18 patients whose death was directly attributable to extracranial GCA the causes were ruptured aortic aneurysm (6), aortic dissection (6), stroke (3), and myocardial infarction (3). The findings of these 72 cases caution against attributing all aortic and large-vessel arterial disease in the elderly to atherosclerosis and emphasize that timely surgical intervention may be necessary for life-saving and limb-salvage in patients with aortic and extracranial GCA.",M2

Temporal arteritis (TA) with <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> (PMR) was established in biopsy of the temporal artery, and steroid therapy was effective. In our hospital, a third patient of 81 years was also suffering from TA with PMR, but temporal artery biopsy was not performed. Those three cases were followed for several years after the diagnosis of TA. Two years later, cancer in cervix of uterus was diagnosed in first case, and acute myelogenous leukemia in second case. However, such symptoms were not observed in third case. These findings and recently described reports suggest that the patients with biopsy-proven TA may have an increased risk of developing malignancy.",M2
7718419,"Molecular approaches toward pathologic mechanisms in giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis.Molecular techniques have provided new tools to define genetic systems involved in disease susceptibility and to dissect molecular events driving inflammatory reactions. Inflammatory infiltrates in the wall of large and medium-sized arteries, sometimes associated with giant cell formation, are pathognomic for Takayasu's arteritis (TA) and giant cell (cranial) arteritis. Molecular techniques have been used successfully to define genetic host factors involved in disease susceptibility and to dissect the nature of inflammatory cells and mediators in the pathologic lesions. Careful analysis of incidence data for TA suggests that TA is a worldwide disease. Genetic comparison of western and eastern TA, however, raises the possibility of disease heterogeneity. Emerging data indicate that HLA-DRB1 genes represent important risk factors in giant cell arteritis. Whether disease association is related to the role of HLA-DR molecules in presenting a disease-inducing antigen remains to be seen. Analysis of the molecular diversity of tissue-infiltrating T cells indicates that a small proportion of CD4+ T cells proliferate in situ, potentially as a result of antigen recognition. Tissue cytokine profiles reveal functional selection of T cells and are compatible with the model that Th1 cells recognize antigen on the surface of activated macrophages. The presence of T cell-derived cytokines in temporal artery tissue of patients with <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> who are lacking microscopic inflammation indicates subclinical vasculitis.",M2

Histopathological study shows a granulomatous inflammatory lesion with mono-nuclear cell infiltration, associated with Langhans type giant cells, involving mainly the tunica media. Temporal arteritis is not considered to be a life-threatening disorder, however, visual disturbance, the most serious complication, may appear in those with affection of the ophthalmic artery, resulting in blindness in approximately 26% of the untreated cases. Therefore, early diagnosis by temporal artery biopsy and immediate steroid administration should be the keynote of successful therapy for preventing such a critical complication and for relief of the symptoms.",M2
8024610,"Giant cell arteritis in Iceland. An epidemiologic and histopathologic analysis.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and clinical and histopathologic features of giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA) in the Caucasian population of Iceland. METHODS: All patients diagnosed between 1984 and 1990 were included. Case ascertainment for the study was done in 2 ways: 1) a computerized search from all hospitals and primary care clinics for the diagnosis of GCA, and 2) a review of all temporal artery biopsies performed during the 7-year period. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three patients with GCA were identified. All fulfilled the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria for the classification of GCA. The incidence rate for the population 50 years and older was 27/100,000 (36/100,000 and 18/100,000 for women and men, respectively). Clinical findings included the following: mean age at diagnosis 72.5 years for women and 70.3 years for men, new headache 63.2%, abnormal temporal artery on palpation 43.6%, mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate 88 mm/hour, symptoms of <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e> 48.1%, and visual disturbances 14.3%. A total of 744 patients underwent temporal artery biopsy during the 7-year period; 16.8% had a positive biopsy result. All 133 patients with the diagnosis of GCA underwent a temporal artery biopsy; 94% had a positive result. Histopathologic findings from the positive biopsies included a fragmented internal elastic lamina in 99.2%, giant cells in 65.6%, and fibrinoid necrosis in 12%.

8185705,"Application of neural networks to the classification of giant cell arteritis.OBJECTIVE: Neural networks are a group of computer-based pattern recognition methods that have recently been applied to clinical diagnosis and classification. In this study, we applied one type of neural network, the backpropagation network, to the diagnostic classification of giant cell arteritis (GCA). METHODS: The analysis was performed on the 807 cases in the vasculitis database of the American College of Rheumatology. Classification was based on the 8 clinical criteria previously used for classification of this data set: 1) age &gt; or = 50 years, 2) new localized headache, 3) temporal artery tenderness or decrease in temporal artery pulse, 4) <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>, 5) abnormal result on artery biopsy, 6) erythrocyte sedimentation rate &gt; or = 50 mm/hour, 7) scalp tenderness or nodules, and 8) claudication of the jaw, of the tongue, or on swallowing. To avoid overtraining, network training was terminated when the generalization error reached a minimum. True cross-validation classification rates were obtained. RESULTS: Neural networks correctly classified 94.4% of the GCA cases (n = 214) and 91.9% of the other vasculitis cases (n = 593). In comparison, classification trees correctly classified 91.6% of the GCA cases and 93.4% of the other vasculitis cases. Neural nets and classification trees were compared by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The ROC curves for the two methods crossed, indicating that the better classification method depended on the choice of decision threshold. At a decision threshold that gave equal costs to percentage increases in false-positive and false-negative results, the methods were not significantly different in their performance (P = 0.45). CONCLUSION: Neural networks are a potentially useful method for developing diagnostic classification rules from clinical data.",M2

We assessed the diagnostic value of CD8+ levels in a larger group of patients with temporal arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica before and after treatment with prednisolone and in relation to patients with other medical and rheumatic diseases. Median percentage and number of CD8+ cells in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica were significantly decreased (CD8+% 12.0, CD8+ cells 0.192 x 10(9)/l) compared with 1) controls (CD8+% 23.0, CD8+ cells 0.51 x 10(9)/l), 2) patients with other rheumatic diseases (CD8+% 20.8, CD8+ cells 0.39 x 10(9)/l), 3) patients with other medical diseases (CD8+% 20.6, CD8+ cells 0.46 x 10(9)/l).

In this retrospective study we have reviewed the clinical records of 150 patients who underwent temporal artery biopsy between 1983 and 1990 in Kantonsspital Aarau/Switzerland. In 18.6% biopsies were histologically classified as temporal arteritis. To judge the indication for temporal artery biopsy the combination of symptoms leading to biopsy and the histologic results were compared. Symptoms were divided in unspecific, such as fever, loss of weight or malaise, and more specific symptoms as headache, jaw claudication, loss of visual acuity and diplopia, tenderness of temporal artery, or <e>polymyalgia rheumatica</e>. In conclusion the result of this study is that temporal artery biopsy may be an important help in the diagnosis of temporal arteritis in cases with one or two specific symptoms, at which polymyalgia rheumatica is a questionable indication. In our opinion temporal artery biopsy is not indicated in cases with isolated elevation of ESR, one or more unspecific symptoms and three or more specific symptoms, because there no diagnostic profit can be suspected.",M2
