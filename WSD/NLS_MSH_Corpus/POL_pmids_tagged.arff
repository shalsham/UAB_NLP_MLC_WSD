20364666,"[Analysis of HIV-1 integrase gene polymorphism in an HIV-infected population from the nosocomial outbreak of HIV infection in the south of Russia in 1989]The paper presents the data of an investigation of the polymorphism of the <e>pol</e> gene encoding HIV-1 integrase in a HIV subtype G infected population formed during the 1989 HIV-infection outbreak. The investigators analyzed 41 samples of the viruses obtained in 2005-2007. Polymorphism at codons associated with integrase resistance to chemicals was observed in 11 virus variants. The circulation of mutation viruses that potentially promote the formation of resistance to the integrase inhibitors raltegravir and elvitegravir has been established in untreated patients.",M1
20209228,"Variability in HIV-1 partial genomic sequences in Costa Rican patients: analysis with different bioinformatics tools.OBJECTIVE: To estimate subtype and genomic variability in the HIV <e>pol</e> gene of Costa Rican patients by using different bioinformatics tools and to use this information to establish new policies to better manage these patients. METHODS: A total of 113 pol sequences available from Costa Rican patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy were analyzed by using the Genotyping, REGA, Stanford, and MEGA programs. The pol sequences came from 77 virologic failures (VF) and 36 basal samples (BS). Of the 77 VF, 22 also were sequenced in the env region. RESULTS: No major differences were found among the variables studied. However, there was a tendency for more variability in VF patients with a high baseline viral load. In the pol gene, 75%-83% of BS and 66%-75% of VF samples were pure B subtype by Genotyping and REGA, respectively. The other samples presented variations related mainly to circulating recombinant form CRF12 by genotyping or to CRF17 or -29 by phylogenetic analysis or a new possible BD recombinant with all programs. In the Stanford program, all variable samples showed a subtype B with high polymorphism. The variability in the env sequences was lower than that in the pol region. CONCLUSION: The B subtype is predominant in Costa Rican HIV-positive patients. There is high variability within sequences with potential recombination between B and F or D subtypes. The BD recombinant has not been previously reported. This high variability is likely the result of possible recombinant events, nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy, sexual intercourse without protection, and many sexual partners. Similar studies should be done in other countries in the Region, in particular in those places with extensive immigration, in order to decrease the possibility of virus variability as well as the cost of antiretroviral therapy.",M1
20116400,"Development and comparison of strain specific gag and <e>pol</e> real-time PCR assays for the detection of Visna/maedi virus.The aim of this study was the development of gag and pol dual labelled probe real-time PCR and RT PCR assays to quantify the proviral load and the transcripts of the British Visna/maedi virus EV1 strain. Primers and probes were chosen based on the consensus sequences of gag and pol clones representative of EV1 genetic variants. Both PCRs had a detection limit of 3 copies of target gene, with a linearity over 6 orders of magnitude. The performances of the two PCRs in vivo were evaluated and compared on a panel of DNAs extracted from blood of sheep infected experimentally with EV1. The pol assay detected in most cases lower numbers of viral molecules than gag assay, yielding some false negative results. The gag real-time RT PCR had a detection limit of 100 RNA molecules with a linearity over 5 orders of magnitude. This did not result in a lower performance of the RT PCR compared to the PCR in cells permissive for virus replication, which contain higher numbers of viral transcripts than proviral genomes. The real-time assays developed in this study, particularly the gag assay, provide a sensitive tool which can be used to quantify the viral load in experimental infections.",M1
20032547,"Evaluation of minority populations of HIV type-1 with K103N and M184V drug resistance mutations among children in Argentina.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of minority populations of viruses carrying mutations K103N and M184V in drug-naive HIV type-1 (HIV-1)-infected children, and to further evaluate their effect on the selection of drug-resistant viruses within highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). METHODS: Newly diagnosed vertically HIV-1-infected children were evaluated. The HIV-1 <e>pol</e> gene was sequenced for subtyping and antiretroviral drug resistance analysis. Standard genotypic sequencing and sequence-selective real-time PCR (SPCR) to quantify minority viral populations were used. RESULTS: From December 2004 to July 2006, we included 35 children who were studied at baseline and during their first HAART regimen (follow-up median time 29.4 months). Of them, 82.9% were infected with intersubtype B/F recombinant variants. At baseline, all children had a drug-susceptible viral population that was studied by bulk sequencing. SPCR showed that 4 children had between 2-10% of M184V, 11 had &lt;0.7%, 18 had no detectable mutation and 2 could not be amplified. No K103N minority populations were found. Once under HAART, children who had 2-10% of M184V at baseline further selected it in percentages &gt;20% in less time than those with -0.1-0.6% or without minority populations (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: It was shown that having 2-10% of M184V at baseline enhanced its selection in high percentages in a short time after HAART initiation. Further research regarding the presence of minority quasispecies before initiation of HAART in large paediatric populations should be undertaken to evaluate their clinical effect during HAART.",M1
19954302,"HIV type 1 subtype diversity and drug resistance among HIV type 1-infected Kenyan patients initiating antiretroviral therapy.The treatment of HIV-1 infection with antiretroviral drugs has greatly improved the survival of those who are infected. However, HIV-1 diversity and drug resistance are major challenges in patient management, especially in resource-poor countries. To evaluate HIV-1 genetic diversity and drug resistance-associated mutations among drug-naive patients in Kenya prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART), a genetic analysis of HIV-1 <e>pol</e>-RT and env-gp41 was performed on samples collected from 53 (18 males and 35 females) consenting patients between April and June 2005. The average age, baseline CD4(+) T cell counts, and viral loads were 38 (range, 24-62) years, 475 (range, 203-799) cells/mm(3), and 4.7 (range, 3.4-5.9) log(10) copies/ml, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 40 samples (75.5%) were concordant subtypes for the two genes and 13 (24.5%) were discordant, suggesting possible recombination and/or dual infections. Prevalent subtypes included A1/A1(pol-RT/env-gp41), 31 (58.5%); D/D, 9 (16.9%); A1/C, 2 (3.8%); A1/D, 4 (7.5%); G/A1, 2 (3.8%); A1/A2, 1 (1.9%); C/A1, 2 (3.8%); D/A1, 1(1.9%); and D/A2, 1 (1.9%). Major reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) resistance-associated mutations were found in four patients (7.5%). Of these patients, three had nucleoside RTI resistance mutations, such as M184V, K65R, D67N, K70R, and K219Q. Nonnucleoside RTI resistance-associated mutations K103N and Y181C were detected in three patients and one patient, respectively. Multiple drug resistance mutations were observed in this drug-naive population. With increasing numbers of patients that require treatment and the rapid upscaling of ART in Kenya, HIV-1 drug resistance testing is recommended before starting treatment in order to achieve better clinical outcomes.",M1
19775717,"Importance of the major splice donor and redefinition of cis-acting sequences of gutless feline foamy virus vectors.Foamy virus vectors are potent alternatives to lenti- and gamma-retroviral vectors for gene therapy. To construct and optimize gutless feline foamy virus (FFV) replication-deficient (RD) vectors, viral elements essential for optimal efficient marker gene transduction were characterized and fine-mapped and packaging clones constructed. For these purposes, new Gag and <e>Pol</e> expression clones which allow efficient expression of packaging proteins and vectors carrying deletions in coding and non-coding regions of the genome were constructed and functionally evaluated. These studies demonstrate that the 5' major splice donor (5' SD) is indispensable for RD vectors while defined mutations introduced to inactivate the gag start codon improve transgene delivery efficiency. Based on these findings, new gutless FFV vectors were generated yielding un-concentrated vector titers above 10(5) transducing units (TU)/ml. By minimizing the second cis-acting sequence in the pol gene, only 3.8 kb viral sequences are maintained in the novel gutless FFV RD vectors.",M1
19770803,"Diagnosis and monitoring of HIV-1 group O-infected patients in Cameroun.OBJECTIVE: To define a routine algorithm for the specific diagnosis and complete follow-up of HIV-1 group O (HIV-O) infections in Cameroun. METHODS: During 18 months, samples referred to Centre Pasteur du Cameroun for HIV testing or viral monitoring were screened for HIV-O infection with an in-house serotyping assay. HIV-O viral load was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the LTR gene and resistance genotyping was performed on <e>pol</e> and env sequences. RESULTS: Of the 7030 samples tested, 78 HIV-O infections (1.1%) were identified, including 7 M and O dually seroreactive samples (9%). All treatment-naive patients and 59% of the patients receiving HAART had detectable viral loads. Analysis of pol sequences from 15 treatment-naive patients revealed a high number of polymorphisms in the protease region, with natural residues implicated in genotypic resistance to tipranavir and saquinavir for HIV-1 group M according to the Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le Sida et les Hépatites virales algorithm. Six patients (40%) harbored the 181C mutation conferring natural resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Among antiretroviral-treated patients, major resistance mutations described for HIV-1 group M were found. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-O prevalence remains relatively low in Cameroun. The cocirculation of groups M and O in this country leads to replicative dual infections. HIV-O-infected patients in this region can now benefit from effective and specific tools for a complete monitoring of infection. However, further studies are needed to understand long-term response to antiretrovirals of these complex variants.",M1
19579699,"Prevalence of viral hepatitis and molecular analysis of HBV among voluntary blood donors in west Iran.To determine the prevalence of viral hepatitis infection and hepatitis B virus (HBV) molecular characterization, 11,200 blood donors from citizens of Shahrekord (a city located in west of Iran) were investigated. Results showed HBsAg-positive in 1.78% of persons (n=200), anti-HDV-positive in 3% of HBsAg-positive cases (n=6) and anti-HCV-positive in 0.67% of donors (n=76). HBV phylogenetic analysis disclosed HBV genotype D, sub-genotype D1, and subtype ayw2. Amino acid mapping of the HBV <e>pol</e> region revealed various HBV drug-resistance mutations though donors had no antiviral therapy. In conclusion, this study demonstrated notable viral hepatitis seroprevalence rate in blood donors in west of Iran.",M1
19559103,"Analysis of HIV-1 <e>pol</e> sequences from Panama: identification of phylogenetic clusters within subtype B and detection of antiretroviral drug resistance mutations.We report the first study to examine phylogenetic relationships and drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 pol sequences from Panama. For this study, we used plasma RNA samples from 135 HIV-1-infected subjects from Panama, of which 82 (61%) had AIDS and 53 (39%) were asymptomatic drug-naïve individuals. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that 133 (98%) subjects were infected with subtype B viruses and 2 AIDS patients harboured recombinant viruses, CRF02_AG/A3 and CRF12_BF/B, respectively. Using a Bayesian phylogeny inference method, 5 strongly supported clusters of &gt; or =5 sequences, designated B-PA1 to B-PA5, were identified within subtype B, together comprising 87 (65.4%) subtype B viruses. Cluster B-PA1 (n=42) was significantly associated with East Panama and clusters B-PA2 (n=15) and B-PA4 (n=10) were associated with West Panama. A Bayesian coalescent analysis indicated that the most recent common ancestors of the four largest clusters were dated in the 1980s and that of the fifth in the early 1990s. The analysis of antiretroviral drug resistance-associated mutations revealed that 8 (9.7%) AIDS patients, all of them antiretroviral drug-experienced, harboured mutations conferring high or intermediate resistance levels to antiretroviral drugs. No drug resistance mutations were detected among the asymptomatic drug-naïve individuals. In conclusion, the phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 pol sequences from Panama reveals that a majority of subtype B viruses, which are predominant in Panama, branch within well supported intrasubtype phylogenetic clusters, most of them originating in the 1980s, and some with geographical associations, which may reflect either multiple HIV-1 subtype B introductions or the existence of local transmission networks originating in the early epidemic in Panama.",M1
19521252,"Molecular epidemiological study of HIV-1 CRF01_AE transmission in Hong Kong.OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the transmission history of the HIV-1 CRF01_AE epidemics in Hong Kong between 1994 and 2007. METHODS: A total of 465 HIV-1 CRF01_AE <e>pol</e> sequences were derived from an in-house or a commercial HIV-1 genotyping system. Phylogenies of CRF01_AE sequences were analyzed by the Bayesian coalescent method. RESULTS: CRF01_AE patient population included 363 males (78.1%) and 102 females (21.9%), whereas 65% (314 of 465) were local Chinese. Major transmission routes were heterosexual contact (63%), followed by intravenous drug use (IDU) (19%) and men having sex with men (MSM) (17%). From phylogenetic analysis, local CRF01_AE strains were from multiple origins with 3 separate transmission clusters identified. Cluster 1 consisted mainly of Chinese male IDUs and heterosexuals. Clusters 2 and 3 included mainly local Chinese MSM and non-Chinese Asian IDUs, respectively. Chinese reference isolates available from China (Fujian, Guangxi, or Liaoning) were clonally related to our transmission clusters, demonstrating the epidemiological linkage of CRF01_AE infections between Hong Kong and China. The 3 individual local transmission clusters were estimated to have initiated since late 1980s and late 1990s, causing subsequent epidemics in the early 2000s. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive molecular epidemiological study of HIV-1 CRF01_AE in Hong Kong. It revealed that MSM contact is becoming a major route of local CRF01_AE transmission in Hong Kong. Epidemiological linkage of CRF01_AE between Hong Kong and China observed in this study indicates the importance of regular molecular epidemiological surveillance for the HIV-1 epidemic in our region.",M1
19490177,"Primary drug resistance and transmission analysis of HIV-1 in acute and recent drug-naïve seroconverters in Singapore.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to elucidate primary drug resistance and transmission of HIV-1 in acute and recent drug-naïve seroconverters in Singapore. METHODS: Acute and recent HIV-1 seroconverters were enrolled in the study. The HIV-1 polymerase (<e>pol</e>) gene was sequenced and used for genotypic drug resistance analysis and phylogenetic analysis. HIV-1 transmission clusters were inferred from phylogenetic clustering analysis. RESULTS: Of the 60 subjects analysed, 95% were men, and 73.3% were men who have sex with men (MSM). Six HIV-1 subtypes were identified, including CRF01_AE (46.7%), subtypes B (30%), B' (15%) and G (1.7%), CRF33_01B (1.7%) and CRF34_01B (5%). Primary genotypic resistance was detected in only one (1.7%) subtype B variant. Thirty-one patients (51.7%) were phylogenetically clustered, of whom 90% reported having local risk exposure, compared with 59% of the patients who were not phylogenetically clustered [odds ratio (OR) 6.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65-23.95]. MSM (OR 5.63, 95% CI 1.17-27.15), high viral load (OR 4.28, 95% CI 1.37-13.36) and young age (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99) were independently associated with clustered individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In Singapore, HIV-1 primary resistance is insignificant; individuals with seroconversion account for about half of onward transmission among recently infected seroconverters. MSM, high viral load and young age are factors that facilitate transmission. Early detection of these individuals is of paramount importance for the prevention of HIV-1 transmission.",M1
19460333,"Genetic characterization of HIV-1 strains in Togo reveals a high genetic complexity and genotypic drug-resistance mutations in ARV naive patients.In this study, the genetic diversity of HIV-1 and the presence of genotypic drug-resistance mutations in ARV naive patients in Lomé, the capital city of Togo, was documented for the first time. Between June 2006 and January 2007, 83 plasma samples were collected in Lomé from HIV-1 positive and antiretroviral (ARV) naive individuals. <e>Pol</e> (protease+RT) and env (V3-V5) regions were amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic and recombination analyses were done to identify the HIV-1 variants. Pol sequences were then inspected to identify presence of drug-resistance mutations based on the WHO list recommended for epidemiological studies. A total of 75 plasma samples were amplified and sequenced in both genomic regions. The phylogenetic analysis showed that CRF02 (48.7% and 51.2%) and G (12.8% and 16.2%) were predominant, followed by A3 (6.4% and 6.2%) and CRF06 (3.8% and 12.5%) in pol and env, respectively. One strain was identified as CRF05 in pol and env. Two divergent subtype A strains in env were undetermined (U) in pol but clustered with a previously described complex recombinant strain, 99GR303. Overall, at least 23/83 (27.7%) strains were recombinant, 19 had a unique recombinant structure in pol, and 4 had discordant subtype/CRF designations between pol and env. The subtypes/CRFs involved in the recombination events corresponded to those already circulating as non-recombinant strains in the country. A total of 8 patients harbored strains with mutations associated to drug resistance: L90M (n=1), K103N (n=1), T69N (n=1), T215S (n=1), M41L (n=4). In this study we showed the complexity of the HIV-1 strains circulating in Togo and documented a relative high proportion of ARV naive patients with drug-resistance mutations. The high number of resistant strains observed in Togo needs further attention and additional studies are needed to confirm this trend especially because the national ART program experienced major problems to provide drugs on a regular base.",M1
19453981,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 genotypic drug resistance among volunteer blood donors in Yunnan, China.BACKGROUND: Drug resistance profiles of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) in treatment-naïve infections have been reported in developed countries. However, little is known in developing countries, including China, especially in treatment-naïve volunteer blood donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-two HIV-1-positive samples of blood donors were collected from 2005 to 2006 in Yunnan, China. Recent and long-term infections were distinguished by the HIV-1 subtypes B, E, and D immunoglobulin G-capture enzyme immunoassay assay. The nucleotide sequences of <e>pol</e> genes were amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic tree and drug resistance analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 49 samples successfully analyzed, circulating strains were circulating recombinant form (CRF)08_BC (51.0%), CRF07_BC (24.5%), CRF01_AE (20.4%), and B (4.1%). No protease inhibitors (PI) major drug resistance mutation (DRM) was detected. Six samples (12.2%) displayed seven minor PI DRMs. Nine samples (18.4%) displayed 10 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor DRMs, and DRMs to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were present in one sample (2.0%). There was only one sample of the 49 (2.0%) in which the DRMs were of sufficient magnitude to result in a clinical change to drug susceptibility, but even in this sample, the clinical effect of these DRMs was predicted to be low. Significant differences were not observed between the long-term and recent infected population. Differences in DRMs were not observed between peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma within an individual. CONCLUSIONS: CRF_BC was the dominant subtype circulating in HIV-1-infected donors in Yunnan. Prevalence of genotypic drug resistances among donors in Yunnan was low in this study. Surveillance on HIV-1 infections among blood donors should be continued in China.",M1
19351212,"HIV-1 with predicted CXCR4 genotype identified in clade C from India.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: HIV-1 uses co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 in addition to CD4 for viral entry into cells. CCR5 is used in the early stages of HIV-1 infection, but viruses that utilize CXCR4 for viral entry emerge in the later stages. This is not common among clade C strains, with previous data from India showing the absence of the emergence of CXCR4-using strains. Sequence analysis has demonstrated that the V3 loop plays a very important role in determining the syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype. The V3 region of the SI variants were observed to have positively charged amino acids at positions 11 and/or 25 and also a overall higher charge. This study looked at co-receptor usage among HIV-1 strains in India from individuals who were antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve and those not responding to ART. METHODS: Amplification and sequencing of the HIV-1 env gp120 V3 region was done on 40 ART-naïve individuals, who were selected for the study based on their CD4 counts, and eight patients who had not responded to ART. The sequences were submitted to Geno2Pheno and Web PSSM. The <e>pol</e> gene sequences of these strains were submitted to the REGA HIV-1 subtyping tool. RESULTS: Forty-seven strains were identified as clade C and one strain as clade A1. Geno2Pheno identified three CXCR4-using strains, and the Web PSSM clade C matrix identified two. CONCLUSION: We report, for the first time, CXCR4-using strains among HIV-1 clade C strains circulating in India.",M1
19349849,"Increased mutations in Env and <e>Pol</e> suggest greater HIV-1 replication in sputum-derived viruses compared with blood-derived viruses.OBJECTIVE: Low-level HIV-1 replication may occur during antiretroviral therapy (ART) that suppresses plasma HIV-1 RNA to less than 50 copies/ml (suppressive ART). Antiretroviral drugs appear less effective in macrophages and monocytes compared with lymphocytes, both in vitro and as implied in vivo by greater viral evolution observed during suppressive ART. Our objective was to examine sputum, which is rich in macrophages, for evidence of increased HIV-1 replication compared with that in the blood during suppressive ART. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study during suppressive ART was performed, and HIV-1 DNA sequences derived from induced sputa and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were compared. METHODS: Multiple sequences encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, protease, and envelope were generated using single-genome sequencing. Reverse transcriptase and protease sequences were analyzed for genotypic drug resistance. The evolutionary distances of env sequences from the inferred most recent common ancestor of infection were calculated, and CXCR4 usage was predicted. RESULTS: Nine hundred seventy bidirectional sequences from 11 individuals were analyzed. HIV-1 env and pol derived from sputa had greater frequency of drug-resistance mutations (P = 0.05), evolutionary divergence (P = 0.004), and tendency for CXCR4 usage (P = 0.1) compared with viruses derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CONCLUSION: The greater frequency of HIV-1 drug-resistance mutations and divergence of HIV-1 env in sputa-derived viruses compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived viruses suggests greater HIV-1 replication in the respiratory tract compared with the blood. Characterization of viral evolution over time and by cell-type could identify cells that provide a sanctuary for low-level viral replication in the respiratory tract during suppressive ART.",M1
19320567,"High HIV Type 1 prevalence and wide genetic diversity with dominance of recombinant strains but low level of antiretroviral drug-resistance mutations in untreated patients in northeast Gabon, Central Africa.The northeast of Gabon, central Africa is characterized by high population density and a high rate of immigration from the surrounding countries. To determine the prevalence, circulating subtypes, and antiretroviral resistance mutations of HIV-1, 810 blood samples were collected from the general population of the two main cities (Oyem and Makokou) of this region. Of these, 61 (7.5%) were found to be positive for HIV-1. Analysis of the env (gp120), <e>pol</e>, and gag (p24) sequences as well as phylogenetic analyses showed at least eight different viral lineages. The most prevalent strains were CRF02 recombinants, followed by subtypes A, D, and C. The remaining strains were found to be F, J, G, and also, for the first time in Gabon, the recombinant form CRF11cpx. Analysis of antiretroviral drug-resistance mutations in protease and reverse transcriptase from this untreated population showed a low level of specific mutations. These mutations were associated with subtype polymorphism rather than with resistance to antiretroviral drugs. The wide diversity and the emergence of recombinant strains are in accordance with the rapid spread of new HIV strains in the population and, thus, the dynamic evolution of the epidemic.",M1
19295330,"Envelope coreceptor tropism, drug resistance, and viral evolution among subtype C HIV-1-infected individuals receiving nonsuppressive antiretroviral therapy.BACKGROUND: In resource-constrained settings, antiretroviral treatment (ART) is often continued based on clinical and CD4 responses, without virologic monitoring. ART with incomplete viral suppression was assessed in 27 subjects with subtype C HIV-1. METHODS: Plasma HIV-1 RNA, drug resistance, viral tropism, and evolution in polymerase (<e>pol</e>) and envelope (env) genes were measured. The association between these viral parameters and CD4 cell change over time was analyzed using linear regression models. RESULTS: Increased area under the curve of HIV-1 RNA replication was a predictor of lower CD4 cell gains (P &lt; 0.007), while less drug resistance measured as a genotypic susceptibility score (GSS) (P = 0.065), and lower rates of evolution in pol and env genes (P = 0.08 and 0.097, respectively) measured as genetic distance were modestly associated with increasing CD4 cell counts. Evolution of pol and env were correlated (R2 = 0.48, P = 0.005), however, greater evolution was identified in env vs. pol (P &lt; 0.05). CXCR4-usage (X4) was detected in 14/27 (52%) but no differences in CD4 cell change or plasma viremia were associated with X4-usage. DISCUSSION: Among subtype C HIV-1 infected patients in Zimbabwe receiving incompletely suppressive ART, higher virus replication and lower CD4 cell gains were associated with drug resistance and evolution of polymerase and envelope.",M1
19256285,"A study of HIV-1 genetic diversity in the Czech Republic: 1986-2007.BACKGROUND: The global HIV/AIDS epidemic consists of a number of regional epidemics caused by different HIV-1 subtypes prevailing in different regions. OBJECTIVES: To study changes in genetic diversity of HIV-1 strains isolated in the Czech Republic (CR) over a more than twenty-year period (1986-2007). STUDY DESIGN: HIV-1 strains isolated in CR from 1986 to 2007 were subtyped by <e>pol</e> gene sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis. The role of HIV-1 subtyping in molecular epidemiology was considered. RESULTS: Awide range of HIV-1 subtypes were found, with subtype B, into which 76.6% of 534 HIV-1 isolates were classified, being predominant during the whole study period. An increasing number of non-B subtypes A1, C, D, F1, G and some recombinant forms (CRF 01_AE, CRF 02_AG and CRF 06_cpx) were identified after 1990. CONCLUSIONS: The absolute predominance of subtype B among HIV-1 strains in the Czech Republic ended in 1991 when different non-B subtypes had been introduced into the country. The East-West migration is responsible for the introduction of HIV-1 subtypes prevalent in Eastern European and some Asian countries. Genetic analysis of HIV-1 isolates from a given region can be helpful in tracing the course of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.",M1
19214121,"Relationship of injection drug use, antiretroviral therapy resistance, and genetic diversity in the HIV-1 <e>pol</e> gene.OBJECTIVES: To determine if a history of injection drug use influences genotypic protease inhibitor (PI) resistance to antiretroviral agents. METHODS: We assessed the presence of resistance mutations in PI-naive injection drug users (IDUs) and non-IDUs participating in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Eighteen HIV-infected participants who reported injection drug use before study enrollment and 32 HIV-infected non-IDUs contributed a total of 34 and 65 person-visits, respectively, to analyses. RESULTS: Based on data from multiple clones obtained from different time points from each individual, we determined that primary PI resistance mutations were more frequent among person visits contributed by IDUs (24%) than non-IDUs (8%, P = 0.05). Although neither reached statistical significance, diversity was higher within the protease region among study visits carrying PI-resistant clones at both the nucleotide level (2.66 vs. 2.35; P = 0.08) and at the amino acid level (1.60 vs. 1.32; P = 0.23). Most of the primary resistance mutations could not be detected using the standard population sequencing employed in the clinical setting. Five of 6 individuals in whom clones encoding PI resistance mutations were identified failed PI-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy within 12 months of therapy initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that more aggressive sampling for resistance mutations among viral clones before highly active antiretroviral therapy initiation might permit selection of more effective treatment, particularly in IDUs.",M1
19133810,"Phylogenetic reconstruction of transmission events from individuals with acute HIV infection: toward more-rigorous epidemiological definitions.Phylogenetic reconstructions of transmission events from individuals with acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are conducted to illustrate this group's heightened infectivity. Varied definitions of acute infection and assumptions about observed phylogenetic clusters may produce misleading results. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of HIV <e>pol</e> sequences from 165 European patients with estimated infection dates and calculated the difference between dates within clusters. Nine phylogenetic clusters were observed. Comparison of dates within clusters revealed that only 2 could have been generated during acute infection. Previous analyses may have incorrectly assigned transmission events to the acutely HIV infected when they were more likely to have occurred during chronic infection.",M1
19130746,"Emergence of antiretroviral drug resistance in therapy-naive HIV infected patients in Hungary.Mutations in the HIV-1 genes associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs were detected also in primary HIV infected individuals who did not receive antiretroviral treatment. Drug resistance genotyping of HIV <e>pol</e> gene was done by in situ DNA hybridization using a Line Probe Assay and by direct sequencing. Viral variants harbouring resistance mutations such as: M41, T69R, K70R, M184V, T215Y in the pol gene were detected in 14% of the subjects. HIV mutants resistant to NRT inhibitors were found in 10 and 20% of patients infected before and after the year 2000, respectively. Multiple drug resistant viruses (2-3 drug classes) were present in 3.5% of the mainly recently infected patients. In protease gene only minor resistant mutations were found such as L101 and A71V. These findings indicate the evolution of drug resistance showing a correlation with the time of introduction of combination therapy in our country, where more than 70% of HIV infections were by homo/bisexual transmission. This confirms the transmission of drug-resistant HIV shown by genotype testing during primary infection in therapy-naive patients and initiates serious clinical and public health consequences.",M1
19106143,"The A-rich RNA sequences of HIV-1 <e>pol</e> are important for the synthesis of viral cDNA.The bias of A-rich codons in HIV-1 pol is thought to be a record of hypermutations in viral genomes that lack biological functions. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that A-rich sequences are generally associated with minimal local RNA structures. Using codon modifications to reduce the amount of A-rich sequences within HIV-1 genomes, we have reduced the flexibility of RNA sequences in pol to analyze the functional significance of these A-rich 'structurally poor' RNA elements in HIV-1 pol. Our data showed that codon modification of HIV-1 sequences led to a suppression of virus infectivity by 5-100-fold, and this defect does not correlate with, viral entry, viral protein expression levels, viral protein profiles or virion packaging of genomic RNA. Codon modification of HIV-1 pol correlated with an enhanced dimer stability of the viral RNA genome, which was associated with a reduction of viral cDNA synthesis both during HIV-1 infection and in a cell free reverse transcription assay. Our data provided direct evidence that the HIV-1 A-rich pol sequence is not merely an evolutionary artifact of enzyme-induced hypermutations, and that HIV-1 has adapted to rely on A-rich RNA sequences to support the synthesis of viral cDNA during reverse transcription, highlighting the utility of using 'structurally poor' RNA domains in regulating biological process.",M1
19019964,"HLA-associated clinical progression correlates with epitope reversion rates in early human immunodeficiency virus infection.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can evade immunity shortly after transmission to a new host but the clinical significance of this early viral adaptation in HIV infection is not clear. We present an analysis of sequence variation from a longitudinal cohort study of HIV adaptation in 189 acute seroconverters followed for up to 3 years. We measured the rates of variation within well-defined epitopes to determine associations with the HLA-linked hazard of disease progression. We found early reversion across both the gag and <e>pol</e> genes, with a 10-fold faster rate of escape in gag (2.2 versus 0.27 forward mutations/1,000 amino acid sites). For most epitopes (23/34), variation in the HLA-matched and HLA-unmatched controls was similar. For a minority of epitopes (8/34, and generally associated with HLA class I alleles that confer clinical benefit), new variants appeared early and consistently over the first 3 years of infection. Reversion occurred early at a rate which was HLA-dependent and correlated with the HLA class 1-associated relative hazard of disease progression and death (P = 0.0008), reinforcing the association between strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses, viral fitness, and disease status. These data provide a comprehensive overview of viral adaptation in the first 3 years of infection. Our findings of HLA-dependent reversion suggest that costs are borne by some escape variants which may benefit the host, a finding contrary to a simple immune evasion paradigm. These epitopes, which are both strongly and frequently recognized, and for which escape involves a high cost to the virus, have the potential to optimize vaccine design.",M1
19008401,"Recombination analysis and structure prediction show correlation between breakpoint clusters and RNA hairpins in the <e>pol</e> gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 unique recombinant forms.Recombination is recognized as a primary force in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution, increasing viral diversity through reshuffling of genomic portions. The strand-switching activity of reverse transcriptase is required to complete HIV-1 replication and can occur randomly throughout the genome, leading to viral recombination. Some recombination hotspots have been identified and found to correlate with RNA structure or sequence features. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of recombination hotspots in the pol gene of HIV-1 and to assess their correlation with the underlying RNA structure. Analysis of the recombination pattern and breakpoint distribution in a group of unique recombinant forms (URFs) detected two recombination hotspots in the pol region. Two stable and conserved hairpins were consistently predicted corresponding to the identified hotspots using six different RNA-folding algorithms on the URF parental strains. These findings suggest that such hairpins may play a role in the higher recombination rates detected at these positions.",M1
18974494,"High rate of mutation K103N causing resistance to nevirapine in Indian children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.In north India the number of paediatric cases with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is on the rise. Most drug combinations used for treatment of AIDS incorporate nevirapine, resistance to which develops very fast if given singly or because of unplanned interruptions. This paper investigates presence of mutations at codon 103 and codon 215 of the HIV <e>pol</e> gene causing resistance to nevirapine and zidovudine (AZT) respectively in 25 children with AIDS. Mutations T215Y and K103N were detected by a nested cum amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS PCR) and the results were confirmed by direct sequencing in five randomly selected cases. Nineteen patients had received nevirapine containing regimen and six were drug naive. Mutation K103N was observed in 56% (14/25) of the children while mutation T215Y was found in none. Two of the six drug naïve children also showed K103N mutation. Thus, Indian children drug naïve or treated with nevirapine containing regimens show a high rate of mutation conferring resistance to nevirapine which calls for a judicious use of nevirapine both in antenatal and postnatal setting.",M1
18974280,"Evidence of a novel RNA secondary structure in the coding region of HIV-1 <e>pol</e> gene.RNA secondary structures play several important roles in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) life cycle. To assess whether RNA secondary structure might affect the function of the HIV protease and reverse transcriptase genes, which are the main targets of anti-HIV drugs, we applied a series of different computational approaches to detect RNA secondary structures, including thermodynamic RNA folding predictions, synonymous variability analysis, and covariance analysis. Each method independently revealed strong evidence of a novel RNA secondary structure at the junction of the protease and reverse transcriptase genes, consisting of a 107-nucleotide region containing three stems, A, B, and C. First, RNA folding calculations by mfold and RNAfold both predicted the secondary structure with high confidence. Moreover, the same structure was predicted in a diverse set of reference sequences in HIV-1 group M, indicating that it is conserved across this group. Second, the predicted base-pairing regions displayed markedly reduced synonymous variation (approximately threefold lower than average) in a data set of 20,000 HIV-1 subtype B sequences from clinical samples. Third, independent analysis of covariation between synonymous mutations in this data set identified 10 covariant mutation pairs forming two diagonals that corresponded exactly to the sites predicted to base-pair in stems A and B. Finally, this structure was validated experimentally using selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension (SHAPE). Discovery of this novel secondary structure suggests many directions for further functional investigation.",M1
18667928,"Phylogenetic investigation of transmission pathways of drug-resistant HIV-1 utilizing <e>pol</e> sequences derived from resistance genotyping.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the nature of transmission links existing between patients recently infected with HIV strains containing transmitted drug resistance (TDR) mutations. METHODS: Virus from 63 individuals recently infected with HIV-1 containing TDR mutations was analyzed phylogenetically to determine virological links. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using maximum likelihood and distance-based methods. Monophyletic clusters detected on the basis of pol sequences were confirmed using env and gag sequences. Potential bias caused by the presence of drug resistance mutations was assessed by reanalyzing the pol sequence set after the omission of 16 drug resistance codons identified in the TDR population. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed 9 apparent transmission clusters involving 24 of the 63 (38%) TDR patients. Each cluster was supported by high bootstrap values and low intracluster genetic distances. The 9 transmission clusters were confirmed in separate analyses using env and gag sequences and in pol sequences after the removal of codons associated with drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Pol sequences generated during baseline resistance genotyping for newly HIV-infected patients provide the opportunity for real-time phylogenetics to identify sources of multiple HIV transmission events. This study demonstrated the existence of several distinct clusters of patients whose TDR strains were linked. Several discrete clusters involving transmission of K103N- and/or M41L-resistant virus to multiple recipients were detected, suggesting that multiple transmission pathways can exist for viruses with the same resistance mutations.",M1
18650362,"Molecular epidemiology of human enterovirus 71 in the United Kingdom from 1998 to 2006.The last decade witnessed a significant increase in epidemic activity of human enterovirus 71 (EV71) in the Western Pacific Region (WPR). In most European countries, this risk is unrecognized despite occasional cases of severe disease and two severe outbreaks in Eastern Europe 30 years ago. In this study we report the first examination of the molecular epidemiology of EV71 in the United Kingdom from 1998 to 2006. Genomic regions encoding the 1D coat protein (VP1) and 3D polymerase (<e>Pol</e>) from 32 EV71 isolates associated with neurological or cutaneous manifestations were sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of VP1 and 3D Pol sequences identified genotype C as the dominant strain. Several United Kingdom isolates had genetic linkages with predated C1 or C2 strains from Europe and the WPR. Recombination events were not detected between United Kingdom strains. However, a previously published Taiwanese strain was identified as an intergenotypic recombinant. EV71 genotype C appears to have continuous circulation in the United Kingdom from 1998 to 2006 with repeated introductions of new strains replacing previous strains. It is necessary to continuously monitor the molecular evolution and recombination events of EV71.",M1
18645511,"High prevalence of unique recombinant forms of HIV-1 in Ghana: molecular epidemiology from an antiretroviral resistance study.BACKGROUND: In Ghana, programs to expand antiretroviral access are being implemented. In this context, the dynamic genetic evolution of HIV-1 requires continuous surveillance, particularly when diverse genetic forms co-circulate. METHODS: Phylogenetic and antiretroviral resistance analyses of HIV-1 partial <e>pol</e> sequences from plasma RNA samples from 207 Ghanaian individuals were performed. RESULTS: 66% of infections were CRF02_AG, whereas 25% were unique recombinant forms (URFs). All 52 URFs were characterized by bootscanning. CRF02_AG was parental strain in 87% of URFs, forming recombinants with genetic forms circulating in minor proportions: CRF06_cpx, sub-subtype A3, CRF09_cpx and subtypes G and D. Two triple recombinants (CRF02_AG/A3/CRF06_cpx and CRF02_AG/A3/CRF09_cpx) were identified. Antiretroviral resistance analyses revealed that six individuals, five of which were antiretroviral drug-experienced, harbored mutations conferring high level of resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors. No major resistance mutations were identified in the protease, although insertions of one and three amino acids were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of URFs detected probably reflects a significant incidence of coinfections or superinfections with diverse viral strains, which increases the genetic complexity of the HIV-1 epidemic in West Africa. Monitoring of HIV-1 drug resistance might provide data on the implications of intersubtype recombination in response to antiretrovirals.",M1
18620490,"Short communication: high prevalence of drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in treatment-naïve patients in Greenland.A molecular epidemiologic study of HIV-1 in Greenland showed distinct transmission clusters correlated with demographic and behavioral data. Resistance mutations were found in a majority of the <e>pol</e> sequences. The objective of the present study was to estimate prevalence of drug resistance in Greenland and identify transmission chains by comparing resistance data with phylogeny and treatment history. Of 60 untreated patients, 15 (25%) had primary resistance mutations. The most prevalent mutations were T69D/N (15%), K70R (15%), and M184V (10%). Four possible transmission chains were identified based on phylogeny and mutation profiles. The clusters consisted of treated and untreated patients and showed the same mutation profiles in both resistance and nonresistance positions. Prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in Greenland (25%) is higher than in Denmark where only 3% transmission was observed. Suboptimal use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) in Greenland was reflected in the high prevalence of NRTI-related resistance in the patients. A combination of phylogeny and genotypic resistance tests enabled us to study the number of transmissions and how the virus was transmitted. Resistance mutations detected in untreated patients were backed up by the treatment history of index patients in the possible transmission chains and indicated that these drug-resistant variants were in fact transmitted and had not emerged due to unregistered drug intake.",M1
18614915,"Optimization of the oligonucleotide ligation assay, a rapid and inexpensive test for detection of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations, for non-North American variants.OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the feasibility of the oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA), a specific, sensitive, and economical ligase-based point mutation assay designed to detect HIV-1 drug-resistance mutations at 12 codons of HIV-1 subtype B <e>pol</e>, for potential use in resource-poor settings. METHODS: Specimens from HIV-1-infected individuals collected by 7 international laboratories, including subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, J, and recombinants AE and AG, were tested by the OLA developed for HIV-1 subtype B. Common polymorphisms that interfered with reactivity of the OLA were identified and modified probes designed and evaluated. RESULTS: 92.5% (2,410) of 2,604 codons in specimens from 217 individuals were successfully genotyped by the subtype B OLA. A high rate (range 8.3%-31.2%) of indeterminate results (negative OLA reaction for both mutant and wild type) was observed for 5 codons. Modified probes at reverse transcriptase codons 151 and 184 and protease codon 90 increased the rate of valid OLA to 96.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The OLA designed for HIV-1 subtype B genotyped most pol codons in non-B subtypes from Asia and Africa but was improved by addition of several modified probes. International laboratories experienced in molecular techniques were able to perform the OLA.",M1
18614631,"Marked epitope- and allele-specific differences in rates of mutation in human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) Gag, <e>Pol</e>, and Nef cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes in acute/early HIV-1 infection.During acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, early host cellular immune responses drive viral evolution. The rates and extent of these mutations, however, remain incompletely characterized. In a cohort of 98 individuals newly infected with HIV-1 subtype B, we longitudinally characterized the rates and extent of HLA-mediated escape and reversion in Gag, Pol, and Nef using a rational definition of HLA-attributable mutation based on the analysis of a large independent subtype B data set. We demonstrate rapid and dramatic HIV evolution in response to immune pressures that in general reflect established cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response hierarchies in early infection. On a population level, HLA-driven evolution was observed in approximately 80% of published CTL epitopes. Five of the 10 most rapidly evolving epitopes were restricted by protective HLA alleles (HLA-B*13/B*51/B*57/B*5801; P = 0.01), supporting the importance of a strong early CTL response in HIV control. Consistent with known fitness costs of escape, B*57-associated mutations in Gag were among the most rapidly reverting positions upon transmission to non-B*57-expressing individuals, whereas many other HLA-associated polymorphisms displayed slow or negligible reversion. Overall, an estimated minimum of 30% of observed substitutions in Gag/Pol and 60% in Nef were attributable to HLA-associated escape and reversion events. Results underscore the dominant role of immune pressures in driving early within-host HIV evolution. Dramatic differences in escape and reversion rates across codons, genes, and HLA restrictions are observed, highlighting the complexity of viral adaptation to the host immune response.",M1
18593351,"Profile of primary resistance in HIV-1-infected treatment-naive individuals from Western India.The majority of the HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) testing studies have focused on subtype B virus. The predominance of subtype C in the Indian subcontinent along with greater access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) necessitates studies on HIVDR genotyping. We determined the prevalence of mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) from plasma of 40 antiretroviral drug-naive study participants in Indian HIV-1 <e>pol</e> gene sequences. Of these, 36 sequences belonged to subtype C, two to subtype A1, and two were subtype A1C recombinants. The heterosexual route was the most common route of transmission. Drug resistance-associated mutations were observed in 10% (4/40) of the study participants. The resistance mutation observed in the protease gene was V82A, whereas in the RT gene, M41L, D67N, M184V, and A98G were documented. This is the first study reporting major protease mutations by genotyping in ART-naive individuals from western India.",M1

Plasma was collected prior to the national antiretroviral therapy (ART) program. RNA was extracted, followed by RT-PCR and automated DNA sequencing of the viral protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region. Genotyping was done through phylogenetic analysis. The sequences were inspected for resistance-associated mutations against PR and RT inhibitors. A total of 140 pol sequences were analyzed, of which 133 (95%) belong to HIV-1 subtype C, five (3.6%) were subtype B, and one each was subtype G and CRF02_AG. Five sequences (3.6%) had resistance-associated mutations. These include three (2.1%) NNRTI mutations.

The consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer design and seminested or nested PCR assay design were used to enhance the breadth of reactivity and sensitivity of the respective assays. Using expressed RNA and 10-fold dilution series of virus-infected tissue culture isolates from different members of the family or genera, these assays were able to detect on average between 100 and 500 copies of template RNA. The assays were specific to the respective group of genera or subfamily viruses. This set of primers enhances our ability to look for novel viruses in outbreaks and diseases of unknown etiology.",M1
18559113,"Recombination in feline immunodeficiency virus from feral and companion domestic cats.BACKGROUND: Recombination is a relatively common phenomenon in retroviruses. We investigated recombination in Feline Immunodeficiency Virus from naturally-infected New Zealand domestic cats (Felis catus) by sequencing regions of the gag, <e>pol</e> and env genes. RESULTS: The occurrence of intragenic recombination was highest in env, with evidence of recombination in 6.4% (n = 156) of all cats. A further recombinant was identified in each of the gag (n = 48) and pol (n = 91) genes. Comparisons of phylogenetic trees across genes identified cases of incongruence, indicating intergenic recombination. Three (7.7%, n = 39) of these incongruencies were found to be significantly different using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test.Surprisingly, our phylogenies from the gag and pol genes showed that no New Zealand sequences group with reference subtype C sequences within intrasubtype pairwise distances. Indeed, we find one and two distinct unknown subtype groups in gag and pol, respectively. These observations cause us to speculate that these New Zealand FIV strains have undergone several recombination events between subtype A parent strains and undefined unknown subtype strains, similar to the evolutionary history hypothesised for HIV-1  subtype E .Endpoint dilution sequencing was used to confirm the consensus sequences of the putative recombinants and unknown subtype groups, providing evidence for the authenticity of these sequences. Endpoint dilution sequencing also resulted in the identification of a dual infection event in the env gene. In addition, an intrahost recombination event between variants of the same subtype in the pol gene was established. This is the first known example of naturally-occurring recombination in a cat with infection of the parent strains. CONCLUSION: Evidence of intragenic recombination in the gag, pol and env regions, and complex intergenic recombination, of FIV from naturally-infected domestic cats in New Zealand was found. Strains of unknown subtype were identified in all three gene regions. These results have implications for the use of the current FIV vaccine in New Zealand.",M1

METHODS: Healthy adults not infected with human immunodeficiency virus were enrolled in a multicenter, dose-escalating, blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate a 3-dose homologous prime-boost regimen of the trivalent MRK adenovirus type 5 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vaccine containing from 3 x 10(6) to 1 x 10(11) viral particles per 1-mL dose administered on day 1, during week 4 and during week 26. Adverse events were recorded for 29 days after each intradeltoid injection. The primary immunogenicity end point was the proportion of study participants with a positive unfractionated Gag-, Pol-, or Nef-specific interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot response measured 4 weeks after administration of the last dose. RESULTS: Of 259 randomized individuals, 257 (99%) received &gt; or = 1 dose of vaccine or placebo and were included in the safety analyses. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot results were available for 217 study participants (84%) at week 30. No serious vaccine-related adverse events occurred. No study participant discontinued participation because of vaccine-related adverse events. The frequency of injection-site reactions was dose dependent. Vaccine doses of &gt; or = 3 x 10(9) viral particles elicited positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot responses to &gt; or = 1 vaccine component in &gt; 60% of recipients. High baseline antibody titers against adenovirus type 5 diminished enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot responses at all doses except the 3 x 10(10) viral particle dose. CONCLUSIONS: The vaccine was generally well tolerated and induced cell-mediated immune responses against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 peptides in most healthy adults. Despite these findings, vaccination in a proof-of-concept trial with use of this vaccine was discontinued because of lack of efficacy.",M1
18195046,"macroH2A1-dependent silencing of endogenous murine leukemia viruses.We show that macroH2A1 histone variants are important for repressing the expression of endogenous murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) in mouse liver.

In contrast, MLV proviruses with a deletion in the 5' end of pro-<e>pol</e> were expressed in normal liver and showed relatively low levels of derepression in knockout liver. macroH2A1 nucleosomes were enriched on endogenous MLVs, with the highest enrichment occurring on the 5' end of pro-pol. The absence of macroH2A1 also led to a localized loss of DNA methylation on the 5' ends of MLV proviruses. These results demonstrate that macroH2A1 histones have a significant role in silencing endogenous MLVs in vivo and suggest that specific internal MLV sequences are targeted by a macroH2A1-dependent silencing mechanism.",M1
18191436,"Virus-like particle formation and translational start site choice of the plant retrotransposon Tto1.Ty1/copia group retrotransposon Tto1 from tobacco was put under control of an inducible promoter for expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. The system was used to analyze intermediates of the transposition process. The Tto1 RNA 5' region has a complex structure and contains several AUG codons. We therefore sought to experimentally define the translation initiation site. Constructs starting at various positions within the structural gag region were expressed in planta and functionally characterized. We found that gag proteins starting at the first ATG of the gag-<e>pol</e> ORF (ATG1), but also those starting at the third ATG of the gag-pol ORF (ATG3), can form virus-like particles (VLPs). However, gag protein expressed by the inducible Tto1 element had a size similar to gag starting at ATG1, and mutation of ATG1 in the inducible element abolished reverse transcription. This suggested that translation initiation at ATG1 is essential for the Tto1 life cycle. To support this conjecture, gag protein starting at ATG1, or gag protein shortened amino-terminally by nine amino acids (starting at the second ATG of the gag region, ATG2), was co-expressed with Tto1 carrying mutations at ATG1 and ATG2. Trans-complementation of the defective Tto element by gag starting at ATG1, but not by gag starting at ATG2, defines ATG1 as the functional translation initiation site.",M1

Forty-one isolates of HIV-1-infected individuals had protease, reverse transcriptase, and C2C3/ env amplified by nested PCR and sequenced. The subtype was determined by the program REGA and phylogenetic analyses. The samples identified as putative recombinant forms were analyzed by SimPlot. A high prevalence of subtype B (95.1%) was observed, followed by mosaic viruses B/F (4.9%). The amino acid sequences from 30 HIV-1 isolates were analyzed for the antigenic intrasubtype diversity. The most prevalent gp120 V3 loop motif was the GPGR (United States/Europe) (43.3%), described in B and F subtypes, followed by the GPGK tetrapeptide (10%). The Brazilian variant B  (GWGR), GFGR, and GLGR tetrapeptides were found in 6.7%. Other V3 variants were found in eight isolates (26.7%). Phylogenetic tree analysis was also performed in order to verify the relationship of the HIV-1 samples from Central Brazil with other HIV-1 sequences that circulate in Brazil. The subtype B sequences from Central Brazil formed a polyphyletic cluster in the tree, indicating that these strains are similar to those from other geographic regions. These results contribute to the understanding of HIV in Brazil, and may prove useful for the development of vaccine candidates.",M1

17961216,"Control of gag-<e>pol</e> gene expression in the Candida albicans retrotransposon Tca2.BACKGROUND: In the C. albicans retrotransposon Tca2, the gag and pol ORFs are separated by a UGA stop codon, 3' of which is a potential RNA pseudoknot. It is unclear how the Tca2 gag UGA codon is bypassed to allow pol expression. However, in other retroelements, translational readthrough of the gag stop codon can be directed by its flanking sequence, including a 3' pseudoknot. RESULTS: The hypothesis was tested that in Tca2, gag stop codon flanking sequences direct translational readthrough and synthesis of a gag-pol fusion protein. Sequence from the Tca2 gag-UGA-pol junction (300 nt) was inserted between fused lacZ and luciferase (luc) genes in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae dual reporter construct. Although downstream of UGA, luc was expressed, but its expression was unaffected by inserting additional stop codons at the 3' end of lacZ. Luc expression was instead being driven by a previously unknown minor promoter activity within the gag-pol junction region. Evidence together indicated that junction sequence alone cannot direct UGA readthrough. Using reporter genes in C. albicans, the activities of this gag-pol junction promoter and the Tca2 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter were compared. Of the two promoters, only the LTR promoter was induced by heat-shock, which also triggers retrotransposition. Tca2 pol protein, epitope-tagged in C. albicans to allow detection, was also heat-shock induced, indicating that pol proteins were expressed from a gag-UGA-pol RNA. CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration that the LTR promoter directs Tca2 pol protein expression, and that pol proteins are translated from a gag-pol RNA, which thus requires a mechanism for stop codon bypass. However, in contrast to most other retroelement and viral readthrough signals, immediate gag UGA-flanking sequences were insufficient to direct stop readthrough in S. cerevisiae, indicating non-canonical mechanisms direct gag UGA bypass in Tca2.",M1

Drugs were called discordant if resistant by one algorithm and sensitive by the other. RESULTS: Of 2,341 drug comparisons, 501 (21.4%) were discordant, affecting 140 (86.4%) of 162 screened patients. NRTI/NtRTIs were more discordant than NNRTIs and PIs (38.6% vs. 4.3% vs. 12.8%; p &lt; .0001). Sixty-nine (53%) patients were placed on 2 drugs reported as sensitive by VVP but resistant by HIVDB-10/05; they had higher than expected rates of disease progression and a similar time to first event or death as patients on ARVs classified as resistant by both algorithms (p = .61). CONCLUSIONS: Underestimation of drug resistance by older genotypic algorithms resulted in using ARVs incorrectly thought to be sensitive and in higher than expected rates of HIV disease progression. The use of older genotypes to interpret long-term clinical trials should account for this underestimation, because results may be different if viral sequences are interpreted with newer algorithms.",M1
17926204,"Reappearance of an 11-year-old sequence in an HIV-1 infected patient during treatment interruption.HIV-1 from a patient with multi-drug resistant virus was identified as wild type during treatment interruption. The aim of the study was to describe how the viral population is affected by treatment interruptions and use phylogeny to reconstruct the evolutionary pattern. 15 samples covering 13 y and 2 treatment interruptions were analysed in both <e>pol</e> and env. The wild type virus found in the sample from the second treatment interruption in 2002 had not been present as a dominant population since 1994. Phylogeny showed that the 2002 sample was more closely related to wild type sequences than to other sequences sampled in 2002. This indicated that the wild type virus was caused by recruitment from the viral archives rather than reversion of previously circulating resistant strains. A few weeks after re-initiated treatment, virus showed full resistance, indicating that resistant virus was present as a subpopulation and reselected due to higher fitness in the presence of drugs. Phylogeny of env showed that CCR5 and CXCR4 viruses coexist in the patient. In conclusion, the study showed that at all times during infection, virus is archived in the cells and can be recruited when the surrounding environment changes and the archived virus is more fit.",M1
17904181,"AZT-resistant foamy virus.Azidothymidine (AZT) is a reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor that efficiently blocks the replication of spumaretroviruses or foamy viruses (FVs). To more precisely elucidate the mechanism of action of the FV RT enzyme, we generated an AZT-resistant FV in cell culture. Biologically resistant virus was obtained for simian foamy virus from macaque (SFVmac), which was insensitive to AZT concentrations of 1 mM, but not for FVs derived from chimpanzees. Nucleotide sequencing revealed four non-silent mutations in the <e>pol</e> gene. Introduction of these mutations into an infectious molecular clone identified all changes to be required for the fully AZT-resistant phenotype of SFVmac. The alteration of individual sites showed that AZT resistance in SFVmac was likely acquired by consecutive acquisition of pol mutations in a defined order, because some alterations on their own did not result in an efficiently replicating virus, neither in the presence nor in the absence of AZT. The introduction of the mutations into the RT of the closely related prototypic FV (PFV) did not yield an AZT-resistant virus, instead they significantly impaired the viral fitness.",M1
17687491,"A transient three-plasmid expression system for the production of hepatocytes targeting retroviral vectors.Targeting of retroviral vectors to specific cells was attempted through modifying the surface protein of the murine leukemia viruses (MLVs), but in many cases the protein function was affected, and it is difficult to achieve the targeted delivery. In this study, we have tried to engineer ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia viruses (MoMLV)-based retroviral vectors to transduce hepatocytes. A chimeric envelope (Env) expression plasmid was constructed containing the hepatitis B virus PreS2 peptide fused to aa +1 at the N-terminus of Env. Following simultaneous transfection of pgag-<e>pol</e>, pLEGFP and chimeric env plasmids into 293T cells, helper-free retrovirus stocks with the titer of approximately 10(4) infectious units/ml were achieved at 48 h post-transfection. These pseudotype vectors showed the normal host range of retrovirus, infecting host NIH 3T3 cells, although the efficiency was reduced compared with that of virions carrying wild-type ecotropic MoMLV envelope. In addition, the resultant pseudotype viruses could transduce human hepatoma cells mediated by polymerized human serum albumin with relatively high titers in comparison with those transductions without polymerized human serum albumin. This approach can be used to target hepatocytes selectively.",M1
17684370,"The Herpes simplex virus gene <e>Pol</e> expressed in herpes-associated erythema multiforme lesions upregulates/activates SP1 and inflammatory cytokines.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Herpes-simplex-virus-associated erythema multiforme (HAEM) is characterized by lesional skin expression of the viral protein Pol and localized inflammation. The objective of this study is to examine the mechanism whereby Pol induces localized inflammation. METHODS: A431 cells transfected with Pol or an empty vector and lesional skin from HAEM or drug-induced erythema multiforme patients were examined for expression of the transcription factor SP1 and SP1-regulated genes by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: SP1, TGF-beta, p21(waf1) and Hsp27 were upregulated in A431 cells transfected with Pol but not the empty vector. Expression was further increased by exposure to IFN-gamma. Pol+ HAEM lesional skin expressed SP1, Hsp27, TGF-beta and p21(waf1). Normal skin and drug-induced erythema multiforme lesional skin were negative. CONCLUSION: The data indicate that Pol activates SP1, causing upregulation of SP1 target genes (notably TGF-beta) involved in localized inflammation. Upregulation is potentiated by IFN-gamma.",M1
17678466,"Genetic diversity and drug resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains circulating in Shanghai.The HIV-1 epidemic in Shanghai is rapidly increasing. To better understand the HIV-1 genetic diversity and the mutations associated with resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs) and reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs), 95 antiretroviral (ARV)-treated and treatment-naive HIV-1-seropositive individuals living in Shanghai were investigated. The HIV-1 <e>pol</e> gene in 70 of the 95 plasma samples was successfully amplified and analyzed. The result showed that CRF01_AE predominated in Shanghai with 42.9%, followed by subtype B (10%), B' (12.9%), CRF07_BC (11.4%), CRF08_BC (10%), CRF02_AG (4.3%), G (2.9%), and K (1.4%). In addition, three new intersubtype and/or inter-CRF recombinants were detected including B'/CRF01_AE (1.4%), U/G (1.4%), and U/CRF01_AE (1.4%). The mutations conferring primary and secondary resistance to PIs were detected in 3 of 70 (4.3%) patients and the mutations conferring resistance to RTIs were identified in 12 of 70 (17.2%) patients, among whom 11 of 15 (73.3%) and 1 of 55 (1.8%) were ARV-treated and treatment-naive individuals, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). This study reveals the emergence of genetic diversity of HIV-1 currently circulating in Shanghai. HIV-1 infection by heterosexual contact is still a major route for introduction of HIV-1 variants into this city in recent years. It is believed that this information may help to guide recommendations for diagnostic assays, vaccine design, and antiretroviral regimen strategies in China.",M1
17662474,"Systematic evaluation of allele-specific real-time PCR for the detection of minor HIV-1 variants with <e>pol</e> and env resistance mutations.Allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) is a highly sensitive, and reproducible method for the study of minor HIV-1 variants harboring resistance mutations and is significantly less labor-intensive and time-consuming than other techniques used for similar purposes. Furthermore, ASPCR has multiple applications in HIV research: it provides earlier and more sensitive detection of evolving resistance mutations, a more accurate assessment of transmitted drug-resistant mutants and a better evaluation of resistance selection after post-exposure or mother-to-child-transmission prophylaxis programs. This article outlines the principles of ASPCR and illustrates technical challenges in the design and application of ASPCR protocols by describing ASPCR assays developed for detecting resistance mutations in the protease (PR)- and reverse transcriptase (RT)-coding regions of pol and env. The assays achieved sensitivities of &lt;1% for the D30N mutation in HIV-1 PR, M184V and I mutations in RT, and V38A in gp41. This method can be easily adapted to the quantitative detection of other mutations in HIV-1 or other viruses by introducing minor modifications to the methods described. In addition, ASPCR can be used to assess the dynamics of mutant populations in the viral quasispecies in response to changing selection pressures, allowing inferences on viral fitness in vivo through mathematical modeling.",M1
17607774,"Quasispecies analysis of novel HIV-1 recombinants of subtypes A and G reveals no similarity to the mosaic structure of CRF02_AG.HIV-1 circulating recombinant form (CRF) 02_AG is responsible for greater than 65% of HIV-1 infections in Cameroon and is widespread across West and West-Central Africa. The parental subtypes A1 and G cocirculate in this part of Africa, and high rates of infection predispose to the generation of AG unique recombinant forms (URFs). Little is known as to whether A1 and G can recombine and thrive in vivo with breakpoints other than those characteristic of CRF02_AG. In this study, six unique recombinant viruses of subtypes A1 and G were identified in two individuals in Cameroon. A 1.5 kb fragment of the reverse transcriptase (RT) region of <e>pol</e> (HXB2 location 2,612-4,159) and the entire env gene (HXB2 location 6,202-9,096) were evaluated by phylogenetic and breakpoint analyses. Each URF was found to have breakpoints different than CRF02_AG, indicating that A and G gene segments are functionally compatible with more than one pattern of recombination. Furthermore, contemporaneous, cultured viruses from these individuals were analyzed, revealing different proportions of URFs compared to those found in plasma, possibly indicating compart mentalization and/or phenotypic variation among the URFs. CRF02_AG emerged from West-Central Africa to become a highly successful viral strain. As such, monitoring the spread of newly emerging AG recombinants is critical not only for understanding the epidemiology of HIV-1, but also in the design of future therapeutics and vaccines appropriate to this part of Africa, and globally.",M1
17604549,"Difficulties in classifying a/g recombinants: methodological problems or genetic variability?Thirty <e>pol</e> gene plasma-derived sequences clustering with the circulating recombinant form (CRF) 02_AG (IbNG) (bootstrap 100%) were evaluated to analyze the genomic composition. Subtype assignment was also phylogenetically confirmed by C2-V3 region analysis for 18/21 sequences evaluated. Thereafter, we compared the genomic recombination of the CRF02_AG/IbNG prototype as predicted by bootscanning and Jumping HMMER software (jpHMM) to that of our strains. With these methods, 27% and 50%, respectively, of our clinical sequences demonstrated the same pol structure as the prototype CRF02_A/G-IbNG. However, in subtrees built for each segment predicted by jpHMM (with a bootstrap value of more than 75%), all fragments clustered with IbNG and were distinct from A and G clades. Overall, our sequences resulted in true members of CRF02_AG-IbNG, which, however, appeared to be a subtype phylogenetically separate from A or G, at least with regard to the pol gene.",M1

The phylogenetic analysis revealed 14 potentially significant transmission clusters (bootstrap value &gt; or = 98%), comprising 34 HIV-1 strains. The vast majority of clustered individuals were men (91%), and of them, 79% were men who have sex with men. Factors significantly associated with clustering were: recent infection (HIV-1 infection during or after year 2003), diagnosis of primary HIV-1 infection, higher CD4 cell count and acquiring HIV-1 infection in Slovenia. Recent subtype B HIV-1 infections are the important driving force of current HIV-1 epidemic in Slovenia.",M1

17502727,"Antiretroviral drug resistance, HIV-1 tropism, and HIV-1 subtype among men who have sex with men with recent HIV-1 infection.OBJECTIVE: Antiretroviral drug treatment may be complicated in individuals infected with antiretroviral drug-resistant or non-subtype B HIV-1 strains. HIV-1 tropism may also affect disease progression. We analyzed antiretroviral drug resistance, HIV-1 subtype, and HIV-1 tropism among 195 men who have sex with men from six major cities in the United States, using samples collected within 6 months of HIV-1 seroconversion (1999-2003). METHODS: HIV-1 genotyping was performed using the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System. HIV-1 tropism was determined using a commercial assay. HIV-1 subtyping was performed by phylogenetic analysis of <e>pol</e> region sequences. RESULTS: Thirty-one (15.9%) of the men had evidence of antiretroviral drug resistance. Seven (3.6%) men had multi-class resistance, including three (1.5%) with resistance to all three antiretroviral drug classes. We found no statistically significant association of antiretroviral drug resistance with demographic factors, sexual practices, self-reported sexually transmitted infections, use of recreational drugs, or use of antiretroviral drug post-exposure prophylaxis. All samples were HIV-1 subtype B. Four men had CXCR4-using HIV-1 strains. One man with a CXCR4-using strain also had antiretroviral drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Antiretroviral drug resistance is relatively common among recently infected men who have sex with men in the United States. CXCR4-using strains were detected in a small number of these infections, which were all subtype B HIV-1.",M1
17433486,"Sequence analysis of Jembrana disease virus strains reveals a genetically stable lentivirus.Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is a lentivirus associated with an acute disease syndrome with a 20% case fatality rate in Bos javanicus (Bali cattle) in Indonesia, occurring after a short incubation period and with no recurrence of the disease after recovery. Partial regions of gag and <e>pol</e> and the entire env were examined for sequence variation in DNA samples from cases of Jembrana disease obtained from Bali, Sumatra and South Kalimantan in Indonesian Borneo. A high level of nucleotide conservation (97-100%) was observed in gag sequences from samples taken in Bali and Sumatra, indicating that the source of JDV in Sumatra was most likely to have originated from Bali. The pol sequences and, unexpectedly, the env sequences from Bali samples were also well conserved with low nucleotide (96-99%) and amino acid substitutions (95-99%). However, the sample from South Kalimantan (JDV(KAL/01)) contained more divergent sequences, particularly in env (88% identity). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the JDV(KAL/01)env sequences clustered with the sequence from the Pulukan sample (Bali) from 2001. JDV appears to be remarkably stable genetically and has undergone minor genetic changes over a period of nearly 20 years in Bali despite becoming endemic in the cattle population of the island.",M1
17411371,"Slow human immunodeficiency virus type 1 evolution in viral reservoirs in infants treated with effective antiretroviral therapy.A longitudinal study of viral reservoirs in children initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in early infancy was undertaken to test the hypothesis that early effective treatment affects the persistence of replication-competent viral latency and the evolution of HIV-1 in resting CD4(+) T cells. An end point dilution culture assay was used to measure the frequencies of latently-infected resting CD4(+) T cells harboring replication-competent virus in early and late treated children. Gag, <e>pol</e>, and env also were sequenced and compared to pretreatment sequences. HIV-1-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were also assessed. Blood samples were obtained from 12 HIV-1-infected children who started HAART at a median of 1.9 months of age and who maintained suppression of HIV-1 replication for up to 5.5 years. Replication-competent HIV-1 was recovered from 10/12 (84%) subjects. Evolution in gag, pol, and env was restricted for years in early-treated children. HAART initiated from early infancy does not prevent the establishment of a reservoir of latent provirus, but does significantly limit the evolution of HIV-1 in viral reservoirs. The effect of early therapy on HIV-1 evolution may have implications for long-term pharmacologic control of HIV-1.",M1
17396997,"Molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 infection and full-length genomic analysis of circulating recombinant form 07_BC strains from injection drug users in Taiwan.BACKGROUND: Previously, we reported that there was an outbreak of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) circulating recombinant form (CRF) 07_BC among injection drug users (IDUs) in Taiwan in 2004. The objectives of the present study were to conduct a molecular epidemiological analysis and to characterize the full-length genome of the Taiwanese CRF07_BC. METHODS: Three hundred and fifty-eight patients with HIV-1/AIDS from hospitals and 133 HIV-1-infected inmates from detention centers were recruited. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were conducted to determine subtypes and evolutionary relationships. Recombination breakpoints of 2 full-length CRF07_BC strains were elucidated using a bootscanning method. RESULTS: Of 206 HIV-1-infected patients who received a diagnosis in 2004, 44.7% were infected with subtype B, 53.4% with CRF07_BC, and 1.5% with CRF01_AE. Ninety-eight percent (109/111) of IDUs were infected with CRF07_BC. Deletions of 7-11 amino acids in both p6(gag) and p6(<e>pol</e>) proteins were noted among the Taiwanese CRF07_BC strains. The CRF_07BC strains belonged to 2 phylogenetic clusters, and the first cluster contained only CRF07_BC strains from the southern part of Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: The Taiwanese CRF07_BC strains had 97% full-length sequence homology with the prototype from mainland China. CRF07_BC was first introduced into the southern region in 2002 and then spread to other regions in Taiwan in 2004.",M1
17330784,"High rates of forward transmission events after acute/early HIV-1 infection.BACKGROUND: A population-based phylogenetic approach was used to characterize human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-transmission dynamics in Quebec. METHODS: HIV-1 <e>pol</e> sequences included primary HIV infections (PHIs; &lt;6 months after seroconversion) from the Quebec PHI cohort (1998-2005; n=215) and the provincial genotyping program (2001-2005; n=481). Phylogenetic analysis determined sequence interrelationships among unique PHIs (n=593) and infections from untreated (n=135) and treated (n=660) chronically infected (CI) potential transmitter populations (2001-2005). Clinical features, risk factors, and drug resistance for clustered and nonclustered transmission events were ascertained. RESULTS: Viruses from 49.4% (293/593) of PHIs cosegregated into 75 transmission chains with 2-17 transmissions/cluster. Half of the clusters included 2.7+/-0.8 (mean+/-SD) transmissions, whereas the remainder had 8.8+/-3.5 transmissions. Maximum periods for onward transmission in clusters were 15.2+/-9.5 months. Coclustering of untreated and treated CIs with PHIs were infrequent (6.2% and 4.8%, respectively). The ages, viremia, and risk factors were similar for clustered and nonclustered transmission events. Low prevalence of drug resistance in PHI supported amplified transmissions at early stages. CONCLUSIONS: Early infection accounts for approximately half of onward transmissions in this urban North American study. Therapy at early stages of disease may prevent onward HIV transmission.",M1
17329450,"Development and evaluation of an oligonucleotide ligation assay for detection of drug resistance-associated mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 <e>pol</e> gene.Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is naturally resistant to several antiretroviral drugs, including all of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the entry inhibitor T-20, and may have reduced susceptibility to some protease inhibitors. These resistance properties make treatment of HIV-2 patients difficult, with very limited treatment options. Therefore, early detection of resistance mutations is important for understanding treatment failures and guiding subsequent therapy decisions. With the Global Fund Initiative, a substantial number of HIV-2 patients in West Africa will receive antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, development of cheaper and more sustainable resistance assays, such as the oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA), is a priority. In this study, we designed oligonucleotide probes to detect the Q151M mutation, associated with phenotypic resistance to zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, and stavudine, and the M184V mutation, associated with phenotypic resistance to lamivudine and emtricitabine, in HIV-2. The assay was successfully developed and evaluated with 122 samples from The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, The Netherlands, and Sweden. The overall sensitivity of the assay was 98.8%, with 99.2% for Q151M and 98.4% for M184V. OLA results were compared with sequencing to give high concordances of 98.4% (Q151M) and 97.5% (M184V). OLA demonstrated a higher sensitivity for detection of minor variants as a mixture of wild-type and mutant viruses in cases when sequencing detected only the major population. In conclusion, we have developed a simple, easy-to-use, and economical assay for genotyping of drug resistance in HIV-2 that is more sustainable for use in resource-poor settings than is consensus sequencing.",M1

DESIGN: In this phase 1, dose escalation, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 21 healthy adults were randomized to receive placebo or 0.5, 1.5, or 4 mg of a single plasmid expressing a Gag/Pol fusion protein. Each participant received repeat immunizations at days 28 and 56 after the first inoculation. Safety and immunogenicity data were collected. RESULTS: The vaccine was well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild injection site reactions, including pain, tenderness, and erythema. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred. HIV-specific antibody response was not detected in any vaccinee by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HIV-specific T-cell responses to Gag or Pol as measured by enzyme-linked immunospot assay and intracellular cytokine staining were of low frequency and magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: This candidate HIV DNA vaccine was safe and well tolerated. No HIV-specific antibody responses were detected, and only low-magnitude HIV-specific T-cell responses were detected in 8 (53%) of 15 vaccinees. This initial product led to the development of a 4-plasmid multiclade HIV DNA Vaccine Research Center vaccine candidate in which envelope genes expressing Env from clades A, B, and C and a Nef gene from clade B have been added.",M1

This study assessed the genetic relationships between viruses found in plasma donors and haemophiliacs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sequencing of the nef and <e>pol</e> genes of viruses from infected haemophiliacs, plasma donors whose plasma was used in domestic clotting factor manufacture, haemophiliacs infected outside Korea, and local controls were determined by nested polymerase chain reactions and direct DNA sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis was used to investigate the relationships among the sequences. RESULTS: Both plasma donors and the haemophiliacs were infected with a subclade of subtype B that is a founder effect lineage in Korea.

17287279,"Phenotypic and genotypic comparisons of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 reverse transcriptases from infected T-cell lines and patient samples.It is well established that cell-free infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is less efficient than that with other retroviruses, though the specific infectivities of only a limited number of HTLV-1 isolates have been quantified. Earlier work indicated that a post-entry step in the infectious cycle accounted for the poor cell-free infectivity of HTLV-1. To determine whether variations in the <e>pol</e> gene sequence correlated with virus infectivity, we sequenced and phenotypically tested pol genes from a variety of HTLV-1 isolates derived from primary sources, transformed cell lines, and molecular clones. The pol genes and deduced amino acid sequences from 23 proviruses were sequenced and compared with 14 previously published sequences, revealing a limited number of amino acid variations among isolates. The variations appeared to be randomly dispersed among primary isolates and proviruses from cell lines and molecular clones. In addition, there was no correlation between reverse transcriptase sequence and the disease phenotype of the original source of the virus isolate. HTLV-1 pol gene fragments encoding reverse transcriptase were amplified from a variety of isolates and were subcloned into HTLV-1 vectors for both single-cycle infection and spreading-infection assays. Vectors carrying pol genes that matched the consensus sequence had the highest titers, and those with the largest number of variations from the consensus had the lowest titers. The molecular clone from CS-1 cells had four amino acid differences from the consensus sequence and yielded infectious titers that were approximately eight times lower than those of vectors encoding a consensus reverse transcriptase.",M1
17277898,"Expression and phylogenetic analyses of human endogenous retrovirus HC2 belonging to the HERV-T family in human tissues and cancer cells.Recently, a new HERV-T family, representative of the HERV-S71 and HERV-HC2 family, was identified using a screen for envelope genes and a computer-assisted database search. Here, we investigate expression of <e>pol</e> fragments of HERV-HC2 belonging to the HERV-T family in various human tissues and cancer cells. The pol gene was expressed in nearly all human tissues examined and in all cancer cell lines. Expression analyses suggest that the pol gene of HERV-HC2 family is more actively transcribed in human cancer cells than in normal tissues, suggesting a functional role during carcinogenesis. Phylogenetic analysis of the HERV-HC2 pol family revealed three groups (I, II, and III) generated through evolutionary divergence during primate evolution, indicating that they were integrated into primate genomes approximately 56 million years (MY) ago and have evolved at a rate of 0.2% nucleotide differences per MY.

In this report, we genetically characterized a subset of the HIV-1-positive samples identified during this survey, including all the HIV-positive samples from Bujumbura, the capital city, and samples from one semiurban and one rural district. One hundred and nineteen samples were genetically characterized in the V3-V5 region of the env gene and/or in the protease and reverse transcriptase region of the <e>pol</e> gene. Phylogenetic analysis of 101 env/pol sequences revealed that the HIV-1 epidemic in Burundi was driven by subtype C (81.2%), followed by subtype A (7.9 %) and polC/envA recombinants (5.9%). One major mutation associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) in the pol gene, as defined by the International AIDS Society Resistance Testing-USA panel, was observed in one individual, but many minor resistance-associated mutations were also present in the majority of the samples.",M1
17262996,"Multiple sclerosis-associated retrovirus in early multiple sclerosis: a six-year follow-up of a Sardinian cohort.The human endogenous retroviruses (HERV)-W family contains an extracellular particle detected in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and designated as MS-associated retrovirus (MSRV). Through nested RT-PCR assays specific for <e>pol</e> MSRV gene, we preliminary reported that its presence in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of early MS patients could be indicative of a poor prognosis upon a three-year follow-up. In the present clinical study, we enlarged our blind observation up to six years. At study entry, 10 MS patients were MSRV+ and eight were MSRV- in the CSF, both groups having a similar mean age and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. After six year follow-up, the mean EDSS significantly differed between the MSRV+ and MSRV- cohorts (4.3 versus 2.2; P = 0.004), as did the annual relapse rate (0.5 in the MSRV+ versus 0.3 in the MSRV-; P = 0.01). Finally, two MSRV+ patients entered the progressive phase, whilst none of the MSRV- group entered this phase, and 9/10 MSRV+ versus 2/8 MSRV patients were treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs (P = 0.009). In conclusion, we found that the presence of MSRV virions in the CSF at the onset of MS is associated, not only with disability accumulation, but also with a higher rate of clinical re-exacerbations. With the known potential pathogenic effects of MSRV given in the literature, further investigations on MSRV are warranted.",M1
17240470,"Natural transmission and comparative analysis of small ruminant lentiviruses in the Norwegian sheep and goat populations.Serological surveys for small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infections have revealed seropositive sheep in several mixed herds, where sheep are kept together with seropositive goats. Here we have examined the genetic relationships in LTR, <e>pol</e> and env surface unit (SU) and the growth patterns in goat (GSM) and sheep (FOS) synovial membrane cell cultures of SRLV isolates obtained from both mixed and single species herds. Phylogenetic analyses of pol and env SU revealed that Norwegian SRLVs derived from both goat and sheep in mixed herds are distributed into group C, while isolates obtained from unmixed sheep flocks cluster in group A, together with maedi-visna-like representatives of the A1 subtype. In this study, the direction of group C virus transmission is proposed to be from goat to sheep. The replication efficiency in GSM and FOS cultures and the cytopathic phenotype induced by the SRLV isolates gave no indication of any species-specific characteristics. No particular nucleotide sequences of the LTR-U3 region or env SU were identified that could be related to cytopathic phenotype.

DIs was randomly obtained by serial 1-day egg passages of a chorioarantoic membrane-adapted Dairen strain (DIE), resulting in substantial genomic deletion, including various genes regulating the virus-host-range. To investigate the impact of that deletion and of the subsequent insertion of a foreign gene into that region of DIs on the ability of the DIs recombinant to induce antigen-specific immunity, we generated a recombinant vaccinia DIs expressing fulllength gag and pol genes of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (rDIsSIV gag/pol) and studied the biological and immunological characteristics of the recombinant natural mutant. The rDIsSIV gag/pol developed a tiny plaque on the chick embryo fibroblast (CEF). Viral particles of rDIsSIV gag/pol as well as SIV Gag-like particles were electromicroscopically detected in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, the recombinant DIs strain grows well in CEF cells but not in mammalian cells. While rDIsSIV gag/pol produces SIV proteins in mammalian HeLa and CV-1 cells, recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara strain (MVA) expressing SIV gag and pol genes (MVA/SIV239 gag/pol) clearly replicates in HeLa and CV-1 cell lines under synchronized growth conditions and produces the SIV protein in all cell lines. Moreover, intradermal administration of rDIsSIV gag/pol or of MVA/SIV239 gag/pol elicited similar levels of IFN-gamma spot-forming cells specific for SIV Gag. If the non-productive infection characteristically induced by recombinant DIs is sufficient to trigger immune induction, as we believe it is, then a human immunodeficiency virus vaccine employing the DIs recombinant would have the twin advantages of being both effective and safe.",M1
17156809,"Full-length sequence analysis of SIVmus in wild populations of mustached monkeys (Cercopithecus cephus) from Cameroon provides evidence for two co-circulating SIVmus lineages.Mustached monkeys (Cercopithecus cephus), which form a significant component of primate bushmeat in west central Africa, are infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmus). We identified and genetically characterized five new SIVmus strains infecting wild living mustached monkeys from Cameroon. Phylogenetic analysis of partial <e>pol</e> sequences revealed that SIVmus strains form two distinct groups within the clade comprised of lentiviruses isolated from Cercopithecus nictitans (SIVgsn), Cercopithecus mona (SIVmon) and C. cephus (SIVmus). Characterisation of three full-length SIVmus genomes confirmed the presence of two distinct lineages infecting mustached monkeys. These two variants of SIVmus, here designated SIVmus-1 and SIVmus-2, were isolated from animals sharing habitats within the same geographic region. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the diversification of SIVmus, SIVgsn and SIVmon involved inter-lineage recombination, and suggested that one of the SIVmus lineages likely resulted from cross-species transmission and recombination involving SIVmus and an as yet uncharacterized SIV. These results indicate that cross-species transmission and recombination play a major role in the evolution of primate lentiviruses among sympatric primate species.",M1
17150415,"Demographic history of HIV-1 subtypes B and F in Brazil.The reconstruction of the epidemic history of several HIV populations, by using methods that infer the population history from sampled gene sequence data, has revealed important subtype-specific and regional-specific differences in patterns of epidemic growth. Here, we employ Bayesian coalescent-based methods to compare the population history of the HIV-1 subtype B and F1 epidemics in Brazil from non-contemporary env and <e>pol</e> gene sequences. Our results suggest that after the introduction of the subtypes B and F1 into Brazilian population, around mid to late 1960s and late 1970s, respectively, these subtypes experienced an initial period of exponential growth with similar epidemic growth rates ( approximately 0.5-0.6year(-1)). Later, the spreading rate of both subtypes seems to have slowed-down since mid to late 1980s. This demographic pattern is very similar to that reported for the subtype B epidemics in high-income countries where HIV was initially transmitted through homosexual intercourse and injecting drug use, as in Brazil; suggesting that the characteristics of transmission networks may be a key determinant of the HIV epidemic growth pattern. It is important to note that most of the subtype B and F1 sequences used in this study come from the Southeast region that has been the most affected by the AIDS epidemic in Brazil, being responsible for around 63% of all AIDS cases reported since the early eighties; but may not represent the demographic trend of the HIV-1 epidemic in other Brazilian regions.",M1
17132935,"Inhibition of HIV-1 replication by siRNA targeting conserved regions of gag/<e>pol</e>.Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting HIV-1gag, vif, tat, rev and host CD4 and CCR5 have been reported to inhibit HIV replication. However, the sequence divergence of HIV and the concentration dependence of siRNA activity represent significant challenges to RNAi mediated inhibition. To determine the parameters of RNAi in suppression of HIV-1 we screened seven siRNA candidates targeting highly conserved regions of gag/pol, based on target site GC content, for antiviral activity at varying concentrations. Only two of these inhibited CA-p24 production more than 50%, 2064 and 2161. Activity varied with concentration, with 100 nM producing optimal suppression. Requirements for target sequence conservation and activity over a range of concentrations may severely limit the number of siRNA candidates for therapeutic development.",M1
17129685,"A deep-branching clade of retrovirus-like retrotransposons in bdelloid rotifers.Rotifers of class Bdelloidea, a group of aquatic invertebrates in which males and meiosis have never been documented, are also unusual in their lack of multicopy LINE-like and gypsy-like retrotransposons, groups inhabiting the genomes of nearly all other metazoans. Bdelloids do contain numerous DNA transposons, both intact and decayed, and domesticated Penelope-like retroelements Athena, concentrated at telomeric regions. Here we describe two LTR retrotransposons, each found at low copy number in a different bdelloid species, which define a clade different from previously known clades of LTR retrotransposons. Like bdelloid DNA transposons and Athena, these elements are found preferentially in telomeric regions. Unlike bdelloid DNA transposons, many of which are decayed, the newly described elements, named Vesta and Juno, inhabiting the genomes of Philodina roseola and Adineta vaga, respectively, appear to be intact and represent recent insertions, possibly from an exogenous source. We describe the retrovirus-like structure of the new elements, containing gag, <e>pol</e>, and env-like open reading frames, and discuss their possible origins, transmission, and behavior in bdelloid genomes.",M1
17100767,"An adaptation of recombinant vaccinia-based ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining for a comparative measurement of cellular immune responses in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in West Africa.An efficient and quantitative tool for rapid assessment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced cellular immune responses is important for resource-limited settings, such as in sub-Saharan Africa. Modifications are required to previously reported methods for evaluating ex-vivo antigen-specific cellular responses based on direct recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISPOT) and by flow cytometry intracellular cytokine assay (ICA). We made such modifications in order to detect specific responses and compared quantitative cellular immune responses in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected Gambians. The sensitivity of the rVV-based ELISPOT assay was on average 1.25 interferon (IFN)-gamma spot forming cells (SFC) per 50 000 PBMCs specific for either infection, and 5 IFN-gamma-secreting CD8+ T cells/50 000 in the ICA. The level of IFN-gamma SFC detected by ELISPOT and by ICA were correlated (P &lt; 0.02). ICA detected <e>pol</e>-specific responses in 88% and 67% of HIV-1 and HIV-2 subjects, respectively, and gag-specific responses in more than 80% of both infections. Lower proportions of responders were obtained with ELISPOT, for which pol responses were present in 60% of HIV-1 and 46% of HIV-2 infected patients, and gag responses in 55% and 69%, respectively. The assays did not show any significant difference in cellular immune responses between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected subjects with CD4% &gt;or= 20%. These outcomes are comparable with results obtained using standard techniques and thus this method is a suitable, rapid and less expensive assessment of cellular immunity.",M1

The multiresistant HIV reverted slowly to wild type in reverse transcriptase (positions 44, 67, 74, 118) rendering the virus only susceptible to lamivudine/emtricitabine. Persistence of the replication-competent resistant HIV increases its potential to spread further and strengthens the importance of resistance testing in newly infected patients.",M1
17075396,"Increased polymorphism in the HR-1 gp41 env gene encoding the enfuvirtide (T-20) target in HIV-1 variants harboring multiple antiretroviral drug resistance mutations in the <e>pol</e> gene.BACKGROUND: Sequence variations in HR-1 gp41 env gene region encoding the target for T-20 have previously been reported among patients naive to inhibitory fusion. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a previous therapeutic history of patients could have an impact on a differential evolution of the gp41 polymorphism. METHODS: We assessed the genetic polymorphism within the critical HR-1 gp41 env gene region in HIV-1 variants from 108 T-20-naive patients (Groups I-III) and 12 patients receiving T-20 as part of a salvage regimen (Group IV). T-20-naive patients included 50 patients exhibiting variants harboring resistance mutations to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs (Group I), 24 patients with variants harboring resistance mutations for NRTIs and/or NNRTIs (Group II), and 34 antiretroviral drug-naive patients (Group III). RESULTS: In T-20-naive patients whose HIV harbored resistance mutations to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and/or PIs, the mean number of synonymous mutations (ds) per patient was decreased and the mean number of nonsynonymous (da) mutations per patient was increased, resulting in a significant decrease in the mean Sigmads/Sigmada ratio as compared with antiretroviral drug-naive patients (Group III; 4.1 vs. 11.6; P &lt; 0.0001). The mean number of polymorphic mutations in HR-1 gp41 per patient was two-fold higher in patients exhibiting antiretroviral drug resistance mutations (Groups I and II) than in antiretroviral drug-naive patients (Group III; 0.41 vs. 0.20; P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our observations indicate that the HR-1 gp41 T-20 target is subjected to high genetic variability, including intrinsic polymorphism and selection of T-20 resistance mutations under T-20 intake, that is increased by the presence of resistance mutations to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and/or PIs. Our data provide a basis for a potential impact of previous antiretroviral drug history on the therapeutic efficacy of T-20.",M1
17075337,"Impact of HIV-1 <e>pol</e> diversity on drug resistance and its clinical implications.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: HIV knowledge is based on subtype B, common in resource-rich settings, whereas globally non-B subtypes predominate. Inter-subtype pol diversity encompasses multiple genotypic differences among HIV variants, the consequence of which is unknown. This review summarizes publications from the past year relevant to the impact of HIV diversity on drug resistance evolution and its potential clinical implications. RECENT FINDINGS: The benefit of antiretroviral therapy in non-B infected patients is ongoing, though subtype heterogeneity in rates of disease progression is observed. Pol inter-subtype diversity is high, and known subtype B drug resistance mutations occur in non-B subtypes. New mutations and subtype-specific mutation rates are identified, however, unexplained drug susceptibilities are seen, and additional insight is offered on structural pathogenic mechanisms of resistance in non-B subtypes. These differences may affect genotypic interpretation and our ability to apply drug resistance to patient care. SUMMARY: Current evidence suggests good treatment response and comparable drug resistance evolution in HIV-1 B and non-B infected patients, with increasingly emerging differences. Impact of inter-subtype diversity on drug susceptibility and on evolution of drug resistance should continue to be a major research focus to increase our understanding and ability to improve global patient care.",M1
17067268,"Genotypic variation in the <e>pol</e> gene of HIV type 1 in an antiretroviral treatment-naive population in rural southwestern Uganda.The majority of studies of HIV-1 drug resistance have involved subtype B viruses. Here we have characterized subtype distribution and determined the levels of polymorphism at protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) drug resistance positions, in antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-positive Ugandan patients. We have also investigated codon usage variability at these positions and assessed intersubtype recombination within the pol gene. The study population consisted of 187 patients, from a cohort established by the UK Medical Research Council Programme on AIDS in Uganda in 1990. Results indicate that 28.3% of patients were infected with subtype A (n = 53), 64.2% subtype D (n = 120), 6.4% A/D recombinant (n = 12), and 1.1% subtype C (n = 2). Variation in amino acid usage at drug resistance-associated positions was minimal between the two main subtypes (A and D) in RT, but there was appreciable variation in PR. Codon usage, however, was considerably more variable between subtypes A and D in both PR and RT. Thus, while no natural high-level resistance to antiretroviral therapy was detected in this cohort, subtypes A and D may possess different genetic barriers to be overcome in order to achieve resistance. With the increasing introduction of antiretroviral therapy into Africa, such information will be vital in our understanding and evaluation of the development of drug resistance as it occurs, and how to interpret resistance data the type of which has rarely previously been seen. This analysis also significantly increases the number of Ugandan PR and RT sequences characterized to date.",M1

17053347,"Characterization of a new circulating recombinant form comprising HIV-1 subtypes C and B in southern Brazil.OBJECTIVE: To identify a new circulating recombinant form (CRF) of HIV-1 comprising two circulating subtypes in the southern region in Brazil, subtypes B and C. METHODS: A total of 152 HIV-positive patients followed at two hospitals in southern Brazil had their viral <e>pol</e> genes isolated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from plasma. PCR products were sequenced and phylogenetically analysed using HIV-1 subtype reference sequences. Six full-length subtype C viruses from Brazil previously described as 'pure' strains were included in the analysis. Sequences suggestive of recombination were analysed by boot scanning and phylogenetic analyses of separate fragments. The common ancestry of recombinant strains was evaluated by similarity plot and informative site analyses. RESULTS:: HIV-1 subtypes commonly found in Brazil (B, C and F1) were observed. Sixty-two viruses were initially assigned as subtype C, but 15 viruses clustered in a separate internal clade. Pol from two full-length genomes of subtype C viruses grouped together with those samples. Boot scanning analysis showed that all 17 viruses had the same recombinant structure, with a 240 base pair fragment of subtype B in the middle of the reverse transcriptase pol region. Subtype B assignment of this fragment was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses using different methods of tree inference and cluster robustness tests. Mosaics were shown to have a common ancestry. CONCLUSION: As CRF_BC represents 11% of the HIV-1 viruses circulating in the southern region of the country, which borders several south American countries, the assessment of its spread is of pivotal importance to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Brazil and Latin America.",M1

16910827,"HIV Type 1 molecular epidemiology in cuba: high genetic diversity, frequent mosaicism, and recent expansion of BG intersubtype recombinant forms.Highly diverse HIV-1 genetic forms are circulating in Cuba, including subtypes B and G and two recombinant forms of African origin (CRF18_cpx and CRF19_cpx). Here we phylogenetically analyze <e>pol</e> sequences from a large collection of recent samples from Cuba, corresponding to 425 individuals from all Cuban provinces, which represents approximately 12% of prevalent infections in the country. RNA from plasma was used to amplify a pol segment by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; phylogenetic analyses were performed with neighbour-joining trees and bootscanning. The distribution of genetic forms was subtype B, 41.2%; CRF19_cpx, 18.4%; BG recombinants, 11.6%; CRF18_cpx, 7.1%; subtype C, 6.1%; subtype G, 3.8%; B/CRF18 recombinants, 2.6%; subtype H, 2.1%; B/CRF19 recombinants, 1.7%; and others, 5.4%. Seventy-five (17.6%) viruses were recombinant between genetic forms circulating in Cuba. In logistic regression analyses, adjusting by gender and region, subtype B was more prevalent (OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.0-12.3) and subtype G less prevalent (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.5) among men who have sex with men (MSM) than among heterosexuals. Within the main genetic forms of Cuba there were phylogenetic subclusters, several of which correlated with risk exposure or region. BG recombinants formed three phylogenetically related subclusters, corresponding to three different mosaic structures; most of these recombinants were from MSM from Havana City, among whom they have expanded recently, reaching 31% HIV-1 infections diagnosed in 2003. This study confirms the high HIV-1 diversity and frequent recombination in Cuba and reveals the recent expansion of diverse related BG recombinant forms in this country.",M1
16894207,"Gag-<e>Pol</e> bearing a reverse transcriptase drug-resistant mutation influences viral genomic RNA incorporation into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 particles.The unspliced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA is both the messenger for Gag and Gag-Pol and the viral genomic RNA (vRNA) that is packaged into the virion. Although Gag alone is sufficient for the incorporation of vRNA into virus particles, Gag-Pol molecules play an important role in vRNA dimerization and virion maturation. Here, a cis model for vRNA packaging was demonstrated, in which nascent Gag-Pol molecules were preferentially co-encapsulated with their cognate RNA used as the template. Genome-incorporation frequencies were evaluated for two distinct HIV-1 proviral clones differing in their ability to respond to nevirapine (NVP) treatment in one round of infection. It was shown that, under NVP selection, there was a twofold-higher incorporation of vRNAs and integration of provirus genome carrying NVP resistance when compared with the wild-type counterpart. Although cis incorporation has been already demonstrated for Gag, the novelty of these findings is that newly acquired resistant mutations in Gag-Pol will select their specific genomic RNA during virus replication, thus rapidly increasing the chance of the emergence of resistant viruses during the course of anti-retroviral treatment.",M1
16870297,"Molecular characterization and phylogenetic study of Maedi Visna and Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis viral sequences in sheep and goats from Spain.Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) are widely spread in many countries, including Spain. However, little is known about the genetic characteristics of Spanish goat and sheep SRLV. In this study, segments from three genomic regions (<e>pol</e>, gag-p25 and LTR) were amplified using DNA isolated from three Spanish autochthonous sheep (one) and goats (two). Animals (one per flock) belonged to distantly located, single-species flocks (goat or sheep). Sequence analysis showed conservation of regions that are putatively relevant to viral survival. Sequences of Spanish goat and sheep SRLV were allocated into phylogenetic trees (phylograms) with known SRLV groups. The phylograms corresponding to the pol, gag-p25 and LTR regions analyzed presented a compatible topology. This showed that Spanish caprine and ovine SRLV sequences belonged to the A or D phylogenetic groups and were closer to sheep SRLV prototypes (A1 group) than to goat SRLV prototypes (B or C groups), according to the current classification [Shah, C., Boni, J., Huder, J.B., Vogt, H.R., Muhlherr, J., Zanoni, R., Miserez, R., Lutz, H., Schupbach, J., 2004a. Phylogenetic analysis and reclassification of caprine and ovine lentiviruses based on 104 new isolates: evidence for regular sheep-to-goat transmission and worldwide propagation through livestock trade. Virology 319 (1), 12-26]. It was not possible to amplify in the three genetic regions the expected fragment in additional Spanish caprine and ovine SRLV proviral DNA sequences with the PCR primers used. This suggests that there is heterogeneity at the primer binding site among Spanish SRLV sequences. It also illustrates the need to develop diagnostic tests that are sensitive in local breeds.",M1
16822556,"Non-radioisotope detection of <e>pol</e> sequences of HTLV-1 proviral DNA: Standardisation and sensitivity analysis.Proviral DNA amplification methods may be used for identification of HTLV-1 infection or in basic virology research. Published standardised methods in this regard usually depend on hybridisation of PCR products with radioisotope-labelled probes. However, this procedure has limited use in routine testing, due to environmental and health risks. The aim was to assess the feasibility of routine use and the accuracy of an alternative detection system that employs an HTLV-1-specific enzyme-labelled probe. For this purpose DNA was extracted from MT-2 cells, quantified and submitted to serial dilution (1:10), starting from 1.2 microg of genomic DNA. Primary and nested PCR amplifications of pol sequences of the HTLV-1 genome were carried out with standardised primers (SK110/111 and POL1.1/3.1). After Southern blotting, two different detection systems were compared, consisting of hybridisation with either 32P- or alkaline phosphatase-labelled SK112 probes. Both detection systems yielded similar results, detecting PCR products generated from 120 pg of DNA (genomic DNA amount equivalent to 20 diploid human cells) after primary and nested PCR. The alkaline phosphatase-labelled detection technique was feasible for the diagnosis of HTLV-1 with the advantage of precluding the handling of radioisotopes.",M1
16815724,"Superinfection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to cell clone persistently infected with defective virus induces production of highly cytopathogenic HIV-1.Superinfection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in human subjects, defined as reinfection with a heterologous strain of HIV-1, has become a topic of great interest. To illustrate the significance of this occurrence, we performed HIV-1 superinfection of L-2 cells, which were isolated from MT-4 cells persistently infected with subtype B HIV-1 as a cell clone continuously producing defective HIV-1 particles. L-2 cells carrying provirus with a one-base insertion in the <e>pol</e> protease were superinfected with HIV-1 derived from primary isolates of subtype B or CRF01_AE. The kinetics of the superinfection in L-2 were very slow compared with those of primary infections in MT-4. Interestingly, L-2 shifted after superinfection to become a producer of highly cytopathogenic HIV-1. Molecular characterization revealed that superinfection occurred in only about 10% of the CRF01_AE-superinfected L-2, which carried provirus of both subtypes and produced viral particles containing genomic RNA of both subtypes. Surprisingly, such cytopathogenic HIV-1 showed predominantly the original subtype B phenotype. Thus, the mechanism of the production of cytopathic HIV-1 seemed to be mediated by trans complementation with pol products of superinfected CRF01_AE. These findings suggest the significance of long-lived infected cells as recipients for superinfection that could result in the generation of new HIV-1 variants with high virulence in patients who are off therapy or do not adhere to treatment, and may indicate the need for precautions against such superinfection.",M1
16797087,"Gene transfer system derived from the caprine arthritis-encephalitis lentivirus.Lentiviruses are attractive candidates for therapeutic vectors, because of their ability to infect non-dividing target cells. Vectors based on HIV-1 efficiently transfer gene expression to a variety of dividing or quiescent cells, but are subject to reservations on safety grounds. Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) is a lentivirus inducing only minor pathology in its natural host and in related species after cross-species transmission. To test the CAEV potential as vector for gene transfer, a cassette expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of a CMV promoter was inserted into the CAEV genome, producing the pK2EGFPH vector. When pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G envelope protein, this vector allowed efficient transfer of GFP expression in human cells (up to 86% of GFP-expressing cells into the TE671 cell line). Three vectors carrying different parts of the viral gag, <e>pol</e> and env genes were then developed, together with a CAEV packaging system. These vectors allowed delimitation of the minimal CAEV sequences necessary for an improvement of vector production compared to the previously described CAEV-based vectors [Mselli-Lakhal et al., 1998. Defect in RNA transport and packaging are responsible for low transduction efficiency of CAEV-based vectors. Arc. Virol. 143, 681-695]. While our previous vectors were produced in a helper/vector system, the present vectors are produced in a helper/free system. However, these vector titers remain lower than those obtained with other lentiviral vectors carrying equivalent packaging sequences. We discuss on possible reasons of such differences and possible improvements.",M1
16775332,"Residual human immunodeficiency virus type 1 viremia in some patients on antiretroviral therapy is dominated by a small number of invariant clones rarely found in circulating CD4+ T cells.Antiretroviral therapy can reduce human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viremia to below the detection limit of ultrasensitive clinical assays (50 copies of HIV-1 RNA/ml). However, latent HIV-1 persists in resting CD4+ T cells, and low residual levels of free virus are found in the plasma. Limited characterization of this residual viremia has been done because of the low number of virions per sample. Using intensive sampling, we analyzed residual viremia and compared these viruses to latent proviruses in resting CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood. For each patient, we found some viruses in the plasma that were identical to viruses in resting CD4+ T cells by <e>pol</e> gene sequencing. However, in a majority of patients, the most common viruses in the plasma were rarely found in resting CD4+ T cells even when the resting cell compartment was analyzed with assays that detect replication-competent viruses. Despite the large diversity of pol sequences in resting CD4+ T cells, the residual viremia was dominated by a homogeneous population of viruses with identical pol sequences. In the most extensively studied case, a predominant plasma sequence was also found in analysis of the env gene, and linkage by long-distance reverse transcriptase PCR established that these predominant plasma sequences represented a single predominant plasma virus clone. The predominant plasma clones were released for months to years without evident sequence change. Thus, in some patients on antiretroviral therapy, the major mechanism for residual viremia involves prolonged production of a small number of viral clones without evident evolution, possibly by cells other than circulating CD4+ T cells. The sequences have been deposited in GenBank. The accession numbers are DQ 391282 to DQ 391351 (for env) and DQ 391352 to DQ 392955 (for RT).",M1
16763495,"A population-based approach to determine the prevalence of transmitted drug-resistant HIV among recent versus established HIV infections: results from the Canadian HIV strain and drug resistance surveillance program.OBJECTIVES: Published results on primary or transmitted HIV drug resistance may be biased because they have been largely derived from specific cohort studies or higher risk individuals who present symptomatically. Here, we present results from a representative population-based study of newly diagnosed cases of HIV in Canada and compare the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance between recent and established infections. METHODS: Available archived sera taken for the purpose of diagnostic HIV testing from all treatment-naive HIV-positive individuals who were newly diagnosed between 2000 and 2001 were tested for recency of infection, HIV-1 subtype, and mutations conferring reduced susceptibility to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (PIs). Recent infections were identified using the Organon Teknika Vironostika HIV-1-LS assay. After full-length sequencing of the <e>pol</e> gene, drug resistance mutations were identified using the 2004 International AIDS Society-USA mutations panel. Differences in drug resistance profiles between recent and prevalent infections were examined using the chi test and the Fisher exact test. The variables examined included gender, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, exposure category, ethnicity, and HIV-1 subtype. RESULTS: Among the study population, 8.1% had genotypic evidence of transmitted drug resistance: 4.1% against nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 1.4% against nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 1.5% against PIs, and 1% against &gt; or =2 classes of drugs. A higher proportion of recent infections had genotypic evidence of transmitted drug resistance when compared with established infections (12.2% vs. 6.1%, respectively; P = 0.005). Transmitted drug resistance was identified mainly among recently infected Caucasian men who have sex with men but it was not limited to this group. Compared with the year 2000, a higher proportion of recently infected individuals with resistance-conferring mutations were diagnosed during the year 2001 (66.7% vs. 46.6%). CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, transmitted drug resistance is occurring within all 3 drug classes and across different population groups. The results suggest that the prevalence rates may be higher among recent versus established infections. Given the public health implications of transmitting drug-resistant HIV, it is important to continue population-based drug resistance surveillance to guide optimum prevention and treatment of HIV infection.",M1

This result suggests a superinfection with 2 HIV-1 strains, one of which showed the T215Y + M184V resistance mutations. The analysis in the env gene confirmed the existence of 3 different strains in the viral population, one of them a recombinant. This study illustrates that events of superinfection and recombination contribute to the viral genetic variability observed in HIV-1-infected individuals.",M1
16761745,"Incidence of lamivudine resistance associated mutations in <e>pol</e>-gene of HIV-1 in patients from north India: a preliminary report.Screening of drug-resistant variants is very important for the effective clinical management of HIV-infected patients and development of new strategies. The present study was aimed to detect codon-184 mutations in the pol-gene of HIV leading to resistance to lamivudine (3-TC) by nested cum ARMS-PCR approach in 10 treated and 9 treatment naive patients. For correlation the whole blood CD4/CD8 cell counts and the soluble TNFRII levels in plasma were also determined. Of the 19 patients tested, mutant variants were observed in 2 patients (Met Val in one and Met Val &amp; lle in second) both being treated with 3-TC. No mutations were detected in the treatment-naive patients. The results confirmed that, drug resistant variants of codon-184 emerge rapidly in patients receiving 3-TC containing regimens including our population, which is mainly infected with subtypeC of the virus that could be detected along with wild viral population using sensitive approaches such as ARMS-PCR.",M1
16760801,"An epidemic of HIV type I CRF07_BC infection among injection drug users in Taiwan.The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) epidemic in Taiwan is rapidly escalating because of an increasing number of injection drug users (IDUs). A molecular epidemiological study of HIV-1-infected IDUs in Taiwan was conducted from January 2004 to April 2005. Of the 131 HIV-1-positive specimens collected, all contained detectable sequences, including 105 from the C2-V3 region of env and 87 from the protease and reverse transcriptase genes of <e>pol</e>. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences indicated that 128 individuals harbored CRF07_BC, which resembles the dominant strains circulating among IDUs in China. Twenty-three individuals had a history of travel to the southwest provinces of China and shared needles or apparatuses there. This suggests that CRF07_BC might have been transmitted from China into Taiwan, thereby causing an outbreak among IDUs in Taiwan. This is the first report in the English literature of the appearance of HIV-1 CRF07_BC in Taiwan. These provide information relevant to the development of antiviral therapy and vaccine in Taiwan and may assist public health workers in the prevention of HIV-1 spread.",M1
16760407,"Effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transframe protein p6* mutations on viral protease-mediated Gag processing.The proteolytic processing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) particles mediated by the viral <e>pol</e>-encoded protease (PR) is essential for viral infectivity. The pol coding sequence partially overlaps with the gag coding sequence and is translated as a Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor. Within Gag-Pol, the C-terminal p6(gag) domain is replaced by a transframe peptide referred to as p6*, which separates the Gag nucleocapsid domain from PR. Several previous in vitro studies have ascribed a PR-suppression regulatory function to p6*. Here, it was demonstrated that an HIV-1 Gag-Pol lacking p6* is efficiently incorporated into virions when coexpressed with HIV-1 Gag precursor. However, the released virions are not processed appropriately and show a greatly reduced viral infectivity. This suggests that the p6* is indispensable during the process of PR-mediated virus particle maturation.",M1

Despite many efforts, it is not established whether betaretroviruses, exo- or endogenous, are involved in the etiology of breast cancer, or other cancer diseases, in humans. Quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) TaqMan-based assays for HML groups 1-7, targeting the conserved reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) domains of the <e>pol</e> gene were designed. Plasmids containing the entire pol gene of HML1-7 were used as standards. The RT and IN based QPCRs could detect 10(0)-10(3) copies per PCR reaction of the plasmids. However, not all plasmids gave a signal in both RT and IN QPCRs, probably due to mismatches. Furthermore, RT and IN based HML6 specific QPCRs were developed. They were specific for amplification of transcripts for the whole HML6 group. The methods allow the monitoring in body fluids and tissues of expression of a wide range of betaretrovirus-like sequences. Betaretrovirus-like RNA was studied in normal human tissues and of HML6 in brains of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Brain, adrenal gland and testis had a high betaretrovirus-like expression. Multiple sclerosis plaques contained the same HML6 RNA concentration as control tissue. These assays are expected to enhance studies on involvement of betaretroviruses in physiology and disease.",M1
16706626,"HIV-1 genetic diversity and genotypic drug susceptibility in the Republic of Georgia.The genetic diversity and genotypic drug susceptibility of HIV-1 strains circulating in the Republic of Georgia, formerly part of the Soviet Union, were investigated for first time. Forty-eight HIV-positive drug-naive Georgian individuals contributed PBMC DNA between 1998 and 2003. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses of partial <e>pol</e> sequences, the predominant HIV-1 genetic forms were subtype A (70%), followed by subtype B (26%); both genetic forms were carried by injecting drug users and heterosexuals. There was also one subtype C (2%) and one CRF18_cpx (2%). The Georgian subtype A strains clustered with subtype A from Russia, designated A(FSU). Twelve of the subtype A strains (25%) contained the secondary protease inhibitor mutation V77I and 9 also had two other silent mutations. This  V77I haplotype  marks one particular genetic lineage of the epidemic in the former Soviet Union. Two strains (4%) carried antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance mutations. Nearly full-length genome sequences of five Georgian strains were also completed. Two, 98GEMZ011 (subtype A) and 98GEMZ003 (subtype B), closely resembled the parental strains that recombined to create CRF03_AB. The use of these parental strains in the analysis revealed an additional segment of subtype A in CRF03_AB. Thus, the HIV-1 epidemic in Georgia was composed of a mixture of subtype A(FSU) and subtype B.",M1
16706620,"Diversity in HIV-1 envelope V1-V3 sequences early in infection reflects sequence diversity throughout the HIV-1 genome but does not predict the extent of sequence diversity during chronic infection.Differences in the extent of genetic diversity have been observed in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) envelope sequences early in infection, and this has been linked to gender and to modifiable exogenous factors such as hormonal contraceptive use and genital tract infections. But it is unclear whether envelope diversity is indicative of diversity in other regions of the viral genome, and thus whether it adequately reflects whether multiple or a single virus initiated the infection. Here we show that six women with homogeneous envelope V1-V3 sequences during primary infection also had homogeneous gag and polymerase (<e>pol</e>) sequences at the same time. On the other hand, six women with multiple envelope sequences had diverse gag and pol genotypes during a similar interval after infection. This suggests that envelope sequences reflect sequence diversity throughout the viral genomes present early in infection and thus provide an indication of whether a single virus or multiple viruses initiated the infection. Analysis of HIV-1 sequences from about 3 years after infection revealed that the level of diversity and diversification was similar between the women in the two groups.",M1

20205116,"Iodine-deficiency prophylaxis and the restriction of salt consumption - a 21st century challenge.The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a recommendation (Technical Consultation: Paris 2006, Luxembourg 2007) that salt consumption, as a risk factor for hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, and select cancers, should be restricted. The European Commission looked to adhere to this recommendation by creating the High Level Group on Nutrition and Physical Activity. According to WHO recommendations, a daily allowance of 5 g NaCl (i.e., 2 g Na) for individual salt consumption should not be exceeded. At present, mean individual salt consumption in Poland totals 13.5 g, of which salt used in household constitutes 8.8 g. In some regions of Poland, this number reaches upwards of 15.0 g/person. The Position Paper on Initiatives Aimed at Decreasing Salt Consumption in Poland, developed by an expert group at the National Food and Nutrition Institute, set the course for intervention, including changing recipes for massproduced food products and large-scale catering, improving oversight by food control agencies, and continuing legislative changes. These interventions should also include education directed towards consumers, food producers, public health professionals, healthcare workers, and media representatives. The Position Paper of the Polish Hypertension Society also sets the course for promoting restricted salt consumption and controlling hypertension on a population level. However, household salt is the main carrier of iodine in the Polish model of iodine prophylaxis. Thus, any interventions also require synchronized action with the Polish Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders. Current efforts aimed at preventing iodine-deficiency look to increase consumption of other iodine-rich products (e.g., milk, mineral water) with standardized levels of iodine. Once they achieve an iodine concentration of 0.1-0.2 mg, these products can easily supplement any decrease in physiological iodine levels resulting from reduced salt consumption. Also required are wide-ranging educational campaigns which will be coordinated by the new designated WHO Collaborating Centre for Nutrition at the Chair of Endocrinology at Jagiellonian University, Collegium Medicum in Kraków.

20205111,"From open to laparoscopic adrenalectomy: thirty years' experience of one medical centre.INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) has become the standardized treatment of benign adrenal lesions over the last two decades, making the indications to open adrenalectomy (OA) limited. The purpose of this study was to show the thirty years of experience in open (OA) and laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) gained in one medical centre as well as to compare the results of OA and LA performed for benign adrenal lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three hundred patients underwent 127 open and 173 laparoscopic adrenalectomies between 1979 and 2009 at M. Curie Hospital in Szczecin, Poland. Analyzed factors included patients demographic data, ASA score, indication for surgery, tumour size and side, characteristics of the removed tumours, intraoperative and postoperative outcome of LA and OA, postoperative pain sensation, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and conversion rate from LA to OA. Tumours with diameter exceeding 8 cm were excluded. RESULTS: There were no significant differences regarding the analyzed preoperative data in both groups of patients. The mean operative time was longer in the LA group (137 v. 82 min., p &lt; 0.0001) and the blood loss was lower in LA group (110 v. 254 mL, p &lt; 0.0001). The mean time until resumption of normal diet was shorter after LA (22 v. 44 h), as was the mean time until ambulation (17 v. 36 h), mean length of the hospital stay (4.6 v. 6.8 days), and mean time until return to normal activities (14 v. 23 days, p &lt; 0.0001 for each difference). The analgesic requirement on the first and the second day postoperatively was lower in the LA group (p &lt; 0.0001). The incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications did not differ significantly between both analyzed groups. The rate of the conversion from LA to OA was 16%. The histopathological diagnosis was adenoma of the adrenal gland in the majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that LA is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated procedure. It may be recommended as a  gold standard  surgery in a case of benign functioning or non-functioning adrenal tumours with diameter less than 8 cm. (<e>Pol</e> J Endocrinol 2010; 61 (1): 94-101).",M2

In 351 of them, bilateral tumours were detected. The aim of our study was to analyze the character of bilateral tumours and summarize the methods of their management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the whole group of 1790 patients, there were 1311 women and 479 men, aged 11-87 years. The group of patients with bilateral adrenal tumours included 258 women and 93 men, 25-83 years old. Hormonal investigations and imaging examinations were performed to search for subclinical adrenal hyperfunction and to define the malignant potential of the tumours. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were treated by surgery for oncological or endocrinological purposes (mainly pre-Cushing's syndrome). Histological findings included malignant tumours: metastases - 9, adrenal cancer - 7, and lymphomas - 5; and non-malignant tumours: adenomas - 24, nodular hyperplasia - 14, myelolipomas - 4, and pheochromocytomas - 4. Subclinical Cushing's syndrome was relatively more frequent in nodular hyperplasia (40%) than in adenomas (30%). CONCLUSIONS: Indications for surgery were recommended in 20% of patients with bilateral AI, most frequently for adenomas, nodular hyperplasia, and oncological pathologies, with a good prognosis in the non-malignant group.

20205101,"The prevalence of benign and malignant neoplasms in acromegalic patients.INTRODUCTION: In acromegalic patients, the prevalence of certain benign and malignant neoplasms is higher than that in the healthy population. We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of tumours in acromegalic patients treated at our department: the regional centre for acromegalic patients for the Małopolskie voivodeship in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During the years 1983-2008, a hundred and one acromegalic patients (30 males and 71 women), of mean age 51.8 +/- 15.4 years, were diagnosed and treated. Pituitary macroadenoma and microadenoma were stated in 63.4% and 25.7% of these patients, respectively. In 10.9% of these patients no data on tumour diameter were available. The mean observation period was 9.4 +/- 6.5 years. The median levels of hGH and IGF-1 prior to neurosurgery were 20.2 (IQR = 34.9) ng/ml and 764.5 (IQR = 569.6) ng/ml, respectively. RESULTS: In the studied group of patients, we found the following prevalence of various tumours: nodular goitre - 64/101 patients (63.0%), polyps of the colon - 13/101 patients (13.0%); uterine polyps - 4/101 patients (4.0%); and prostate adenoma - 2/101 patients (2.0%). Among malignant tumours, thyroid cancer, endometrium and cervix cancer were the most frequent, each of these occurring in 3 patients (3.0%). Colon cancer prevalence was 2.0% (in 2 patients). CONCLUSIONS: From our retrospective study, we suggest an overall increase of tumour incidence in acromegalic patients. Prospective multicentre studies are required to resolve the significance of this observation. In our study group, the number of malignant neoplasms was significantly higher in patients with long-lasting uncontrolled disease (over 5 years), compared to patients with controlled disease.

Detailed medical and economic analyses were performed. METHODS: Pulmonary artery valve implantation was performed in 14 pts (9 men), aged 16-31 (mean 24.6 +/- 4.8) years, with pulmonary homograft dysfunction after total repair of tetralogy of Fallot (4 pts), pulmonary atresia (2 pts), pulmonary stenosis (1 pt), common arterial trunk type I (1 pt), Ross procedure (3 pts) and TGA - Rastelli operation (3 pts). Eleven pts underwent in the past 2-5 surgical or/and catheter interventions. Indication for PAVTI was based on clinical evaluation and echocardiographic studies. Assessment of morphological and functional features of the right ventricle (RV) and homograft with the use of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed in 10 cases. Pulmonary stenosis (max. pulmonary gradient 32-119, mean 72 +/- 28 mmHg) was observed in 13 pts and/or significant pulmonary regurgitation in 10 pts. The procedure was performed in general anesthesia. The deployment of a valved stent in the pulmonary valve position was preceded by a metal stent implantation. Results were evaluated by echocardiography two days after the procedure and one month later. Four patients were evaluated 6 months after procedure. RESULTS: Time of the procedure varied 60-190 (mean 127 +/- 35) min, time of fluoroscopy ranged 12-31 (mean 21 +/- 11) min. PAVTI was successfully performed in all pts without serious complications. Patients were discharged from the hospital 48-293 (mean 120 +/- 71) h after procedure. Significant reduction of pulmonary gradient after the procedure assessed by echocardiography was observed on the second day (20-60, mean 38 +/- 12 mmHg, p &lt; 0.0001) and one month (19-52, mean 34 +/- 9 mmHg, p &lt; 0.0001). Mild pulmonary regurgitation was observed in 2 pts. In 5 pts evaluated 6 months after procedure haemodynamic parameters were unchanged; no late complications were observed. Average cost of the procedure including a price of the valve (82 000 PLN) was 98 000 PLN. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary artery valve transvascular implantation is an effective and safe method of non-surgical treatment for patients with homograft dysfunction. Cost-effectiveness is approvable.",M2
18585894,"Influence of gender on diagnostic accuracy of rapid atrial and ventricular pacing stress echocardiography for the detection of coronary artery disease: a multicenter study (<e>Pol</e>-RAPSE final results).BACKGROUND: Rapid cardiac pacing using a permanent pacemaker may be used as a nonpharmacologic stress during echocardiographic imaging for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). We presented the final results of a national multicenter study, the Polish study on Rapid Pacing Stress Echocardiography (Pol-RAPSE), aimed at the assessment of the safety and accuracy of rapid cardiac pacing for the noninvasive diagnosis of CAD in women and men. METHODS: We have analyzed 149 tests performed in 100 patients with permanent pacemakers (27% ventricular pacing [VVI], 10% atrial pacing [AAI], 63% dual chamber pacing [DDD]) referred for stress echocardiography. All patients underwent coronary angiography as a reference for assessing the accuracy of rapid cardiac pacing stress echocardiography (RAPSE). Significant CAD was defined as luminal diameter reduction more than 50% in at least 1 major epicardial coronary artery. RESULTS: Peak stress was obtained in 73 patients using physiologic stimulation of right atrium by and mode or in 76 patients by VVI mode. Significant CAD was detected by angiography in 46% of women and 57% of men (P = not significant). The feasibility of the test was 98%. Overall accuracy of the test was slightly lower in women than in men (75% vs 88%, P = .04), although there were no significant differences in sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values between the genders. In women (n = 48), the accuracy of RAPSE performed in AAI and VVI mode was 79% and 70% with no significant difference and in men was 89% and 87%, respectively (P = not significant). CONCLUSION: RAPSE is a safe and feasible modality for diagnosing CAD. The method offers slightly higher accuracy in men compared with women. Overall efficacy is satisfactory with both AAI and VVI pacing, although easier interpretation of peak AAI/DDD images results in a trend toward better accuracy.",M2

DESIGN AND METHODS: Population-based samples aged 45-64 years at enrollment from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) and the Pol-MONICA studies: including 3777 whites from Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA suburbs (urban), 3635 whites from Washington County, Maryland, USA (semi-rural) and 3109 blacks from Jackson, Mississippi, USA surveyed in 1987-1989 and 1990-1992; and 389 persons from Warsaw, Poland (urban) and 322 from Tarnobrzeg Province, Poland (semi-rural) surveyed in 1987-1988 and 1992-1993. RESULTS: Age-standardized systolic and diastolic blood pressures at both screens were 9-20 and 5-9 mmHg higher in the Polish samples than in US blacks, who had higher levels than US whites. Age-adjusted annual hypertension incidence in both Polish male cohorts (6-8%) was higher than that in US white men (4%) and approaching that of US black men (7%); rates were also higher in Polish female cohorts (8-9%) than in US black women (8%), but nearly twice those in US white women (4%). Factors independently related to hypertension incidence included age, family history, smoking, baseline blood pressures and body mass index, and increase in body mass index and alcohol consumption between screenings. After adjustment for these factors, annualized hypertension incidence was similar in US white and Polish men (2.3 and 2.7%) compared with US black men (3.4%), and in US white and Polish women (1.5 and 1.3%) compared with US black women (3.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial differences in blood pressure levels and age-standardized hypertension incidence rates, the differences in incidence between Polish and US white men appear to be explained largely by differences in risk factors for hypertension.",M2

Numerous discoveries of Purkynie have still bear his name, e.g. fibers of the hearth conduction system. In the years 1823-1850 he worked as professor of the Department of Physiology in Wrocław and he distinguished himself as a scientist of wide horizons and modern ideas, as well as a teacher and protector of his students. The periodical Opera Omnia that has been published in Prague from 1938 (until now 13 volumes have been published) in volume number six, known as the Wroclaw volume, offers to us works of Purkynie's fourteen doctoral students.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 149 rapid pacing stress echo tests were performed in 100 patients (33 females, 67 males, aged 47-79, mean 65 +/- 8 years), utilizing previously implanted permanent pacemakers. Left ventricular segmental contractility was assessed at rest, during pacing at the rate of 100/minutes and then at 85% of maximal age-predicted heart rate. Each pacing stage lasted for 3 minutes. The test was performed using only VVI pacing mode in 27 patients in whom atrial pacing was not possible. In the remaining 73 patients AAI/DDD pacing mode was initially used in all 73 patients and followed by VVI pacing in 49 patients. Angiographic coronary stenosis of at least 50% was considered significant. RESULTS: No severe adverse effects were observed. Mean duration of the test was 7 +/- 2 minutes for VVI pacing and 10 +/- 2 minutes for both AAI/DDD and VVI pacing. Among 149 tests performed, AAI/DDD mode was used in 73 (49%), while in VVI mode was used in 76 (51%) tests. Significant increase in heart rate comparing to baseline was achieved[[68/minutes vs. 129/minutes (P &lt; 00001)]], also in patients treated with beta-blockers[[69/minutes vs. 129/minutes (P &lt; 00001)]], whereas, blood pressure remained unchanged between rest and rapid pacing stage. Wall motion score index increased significantly (from 1.32 vs. 1.49 in AAI/DDD to 1.36 vs. 1.65 in VVI mode). Among all 149 tests, 89 (60%) were considered positive, 57 (38%) negative, and 3 (2%) - nondiagnostic. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive, and negative predictive values for significant coronary stenosis were respectively: 91%, 75%, 83%, 81%, and 88%. For AAI/DDD mode the above values were: 91%, 81%, 86%, 82%, 91%, while for VVI mode they were: 91%, 68%, 80%, 80%, 84% (ns). In patients treated with beta-blockers test accuracy was - 79%., with ACE inhibitors - 84%, and with nitrates - 93%. During 1-year follow-up 5 (5%) cardiac deaths and 9 (9,1%) myocardial infarctions occurred. The risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death was significantly higher in patients with positive comparing to negative result of RAPSE test. Complications hazard ratio associated with positive result of RAPSE was 13.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.7-106.0, P + 0.0133) for AAI/DDD mode and 7.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-60.9, P + 0.00472) for VVI mode. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid pacing stress echo test using permanent pacemaker is a rapid and safe diagnostic technique. The accuracy is good for both pacing modes, including tests performed in patients treated with beta-blockers. The test can be utilized as a technique of choice in noninvasive diagnostics of coronary disease and prognostic assessment in patients with permanent pacemakers.",M2

METHODS: Cardiovascular mortality rates for the 1984-2002 period, calculated based on the Central Statistical Office data and the results of individual evaluation of nutrition patterns in 4 independent Pol-MONICA cross-sectional studies (1984, 1988, 1993 and 2001) were analysed. RESULTS: The cardiovascular mortality rate in right-bank Warsaw inhabitants tended to increase until 1991, and then a decline was observed -- in 2002 in comparison to 1991 the mortality rate in both genders decreased by over 50%. From 1984 to 2001 a significant decrease in the following dietary factors was found: total energy intake, dietary cholesterol, and Keys score reflecting atherogenicity of the diet and animal fats. In contrast trends of vegetable fats intake increased. The favourable changes in the dietary habits of Warsaw inhabitants were correlated with the reduction of cardiovascular mortality (R2 within the range of 0.35-0.95), and the strongest relationship between these facts occurred after 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: A positive tendency observed with respect to nutrition patterns of right-bank Warsaw inhabitants contributed to the reduction of cardiovascular mortality.",M2

METHODS: The study group consisted of men and women aged 35-64, residents of two districts of Warsaw (Praga Północ and Praga Południe) and the former Tarnobrzeg Voivodship who were selected at random for POL-MONICA Project cross-sectional studies in 1983-1994. Risk assessment of death due to all causes and due to CVD was performed using the Cox proportional hazards method. Persons with BMI of 22-23.9 were adopted as reference group. RESULTS: Sample size consisted of 5,281 men and 5,691 women. Prospective observation was carried out from 5 to 15 years, mean duration 10.7 years. Overall, the observation comprised 117,839 person-years. During the study, 914 men died (including 448 due to CVD) as well as 430 women (including 160 due to CVD). After adjusting for age, place of residence (Warsaw vs. the Tarnobrzeg Voivodship), risk factors (hypercholesterolemia, arterial hypertension and smoking) and self-assessment of health, increased risk of all cause death was found in men with BMI lower than 20 kg/m(2) (relative risk 2.27), with BMI of 32-34.9 kg/m(2) (relative risk 1.41), with BMI &gt; or =35 kg/m(2) (relative risk 1.73), and in women whose BMI was lower than 20 kg/m(2) (relative risk 1.66). Increased risk of CVD death was found in men with BMI lower than 20 kg/m(2) (relative risk 1.97), with BMI of 32-34.9 kg/m(2) (relative risk 1.66), with BMI &gt; or =35 kg/m(2) (relative risk 2.06), and in women with BMI &gt; or =35.0 kg/m(2) (relative risk 2.02). CONCLUSIONS: The POL-MONICA study carried out in the middle-aged Polish population did not confirm a relationship between overweight (BMI from 25 to 29.9 kg/m(2)) and risk of death due to all causes or due to CVD.",M2

From the randomly selected cohort of Warsaw population, consisted of 348 men and 351 women, aged 35-64 at baseline, the fasting lipid levels were determined three times in 270 men and 266 women. The first study was performed in 1984 year, second in 1988 and third in 1993. The plasma level of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (CH) and HDL cholesterol (HDL), after VLDL and LDL precipitation, were measured by standardized enzymatic methods. LDL cholesterol (LDL) was calculated according to Friedewald's formula. Our laboratory was systematically controlled by WHO Lipid Reference Laboratory in Prague and CDC NHLBI Lipid Standardization Program in Atlanta. After ten years of following up total plasma CH increased significantly by 5% in women (from 5.66 to 5.94 mmol/l i.e. 219 to 230 mg/dl) and did not increase significantly in men (increase by 2%, from 5.63 to 5.75 mmol/l i.e. 218 to 222 mg/dl. LDL fraction increased significantly in both sex groups: by 11% in women (from 3.43 to 3.79 mmol/l i.e. 133 to 147 mg/dl) and by 9% in men (from 3.42 to 3.73 mmol/l i.e. 132 to 144 mg/dl). HDL fraction level changed only within the limits of the accuracy of method. Plasma TG decreased significantly in both sex groups; by 12% in women (from 1.58 to 1.39 mmol/l i.e. 140 to 123 mg/dl) and by 19% in men (from 1.93 to 1.57 mmol/l i.e. 171 to 139 mg/dl). The significant increase in percentage of subjects with elevated atherogenic lipoprotein fraction LDL (LDL &gt;or= 4.1 mmol/l i.e. 160 mg/dl) in both gender groups and prevalence of hypercholestrolemia (CH &gt;or= 6.5 mmol/l i.e. 250 mg/dl) in women only was observed during ten years. Simultaneously the significant decrease in the percentage of subjects with elevated level of triglycerides (TG &gt; or = 2.3 mmol/l i.e. 200 mg/dl) in both gender groups was noticed. The relationship between lipid risk factors and age and relative body mass in all subjects was analyzed. In Polish population the levels of lipids and of atherogenic lipoproteins fractions were very high and during ten years of follow up almost all lipid risk factors, except TG, showed disadventage direction of change.",M2
15334155,"Relationship between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular mortality--the Warsaw <e>Pol</e>-MONICA Project.BACKGROUND: Cardioprotective effects of alcohol recently gained wide spread interest and have been examined in several studies. AIM: To assess the effects of alcohol consumption on mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (CV) in the population of the Eastern part of Warsaw. METHODS: The study group consisted of representative, independent and randomly selected samples of the populations of two Warsaw districts (Praga Północ and Praga Południe), aged between 35 and 64 years. The studied subjects were examined in 1984 (2570 subjects), in 1988 (1397 subjects) and in 1993 (1485 subjects). Their survival rates were followed up until 1998. The annual beer, wine and vodka intake was assessed using a standardised questionnaire and calculated for a daily pure ethanol intake. The studied subjects were divided into four groups: abstinents and three groups according to the tertile distribution of the alcohol intake (mean alcohol intake in the first tertile: males 1.1 g/day, females 0.2 g/day, in the second tertile: 3.9 and 0.4 g/day, respectively, and in the third tertile: 28.2 and 2.8 g/day, respectively). The relative risk of death in the analysed groups was assessed using the proportional hazard Cox analysis. RESULTS: In total, 471 males and 244 females died during the follow-up period. There were 221 CV deaths among males and 85 among females. The relative risk of CV death after adjustment for other parameters (age, screening, cigarette smoking, body mass index, education level, cholesterol level, anginal symptoms, systolic blood pressure and self-assessed health status) was approximately 40% lower among males who consumed alcohol compared with the abstinents. The lowest risk of CV death was noted in the first tertile group. Females who consumed alcohol, had a 40-70% lower CV risk of death than abstinents the lowest risk was documented for the third tertile group. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption independently lowers the risk of death due to cardio-vascular diseases.",M2
15002248,"[Assessment of medical students' intake of antioxidants and vitamins essential for homocysteine metabolism]The main death cause in Western countries, as well as in Poland, is cardiovascular diseases based on atherosclerosis. Epidemiological studies have shown that low intake of some vitamins might be associated with cardiovascular disease. The most important are antioxidant vitamins (A, E, C) and vitamins essential in homocysteine metabolism (B6, B12 and folate). The objective was to assess the vitamin dietary intake of the fourth year Warsaw Medical University students and compare it to the Warsaw population data from the <e>Pol</e>-Monica Bis study. A random sample of 182 medical students (125 women and 57 men) was analysed using a computer programme FOOD 3.0 and the photo album of the food products and dishes. It was observed that the vitamin daily intake of medical students was lower than recommended vitamin's values: folic acid--women 67%, men 68%, vitamin C--women 41%, men 56%, vitamin E--women 34%, men 63%, vitamin B6--women 36%, men 39%, vitamin A--women 21%, men 28%, vitamin B12--women 14%, men 9%. The intake of mentioned vitamins was also lower in comparison with the intake in the Warsaw population. In conclusion, the medical students' intake of antioxidants and essential in homocysteine metabolism vitamins is below recommended values, so the education as for as human nutrition and prevention of cardiovascular diseases are concerned are strongly advised.",M2

Warsaw <e>Pol</e>-MONICA bis project]The aim of the study was to evaluate changes in dietary habits and the realization degree of the recommended dietary allowances of vitamins and minerals intake in the diet of the Warsaw inhabitants in the 8-year period. In years 1993 and 2001 dietary habits where assessed according to 1485 and 836 randomly selected 35-64 year old men and women. Over the observation period substantial changes in food consumption pattern were noticed: the percentage of energy from fat decreased from 39.9% to 37.8% in men and from 38.2% to 35.9% in women, the percentage of energy from saturated fatty acids decreased from 14.0% to 12.4% in men and from 13.5% to 11.9% in women, the percentage from carbohydrates increased from 46.0% to 47.5% and from 47.5% to 49.6% and dietary fibre intake from 21.5 g to 22.8 g and from 15.7 g to 17.5 g respectively. In 2001 in comparison with 1993 intakes of vitamins C and B2, calcium, magnesium, potassium and iron were higher in both genders, vitamin B1 in men and E in women. Despite those positive changes still in year 2001 fibre, vitamins B1 and B2 and analyzed minerals intake was on too low level.

The use of vitamins/minerals supplement was reported by 20% men and 28% women from Warsaw and 8% and 17% from former Tarnobrzeg voivodeship respectively. Use of supplements was more frequent among persons with university education, full-time employment and people taking other medicines. The role of supplement usage was different in cases of minerals and vitamins. Calcium and magnesium were used in the doses not sufficient (5-15% total intake) to eliminate the risk of deficiency. Vitamins were taken in amounts much higher (40-80% total intake) than Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). Among 6-19% people, doses of vitamins A and E 10-times exceeded the RDAs.",M2
12931490,"[Are fluctuations in health status related to socioeconomic factors among the Polish population?]INTRODUCTION: Several studies indicated that prevalence of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) rose with increasing wealth of the population and previously higher IHD prevalence was observed in the higher social strata. Later, the IHD prevalence was higher in lower social class because the higher social class faster followed the recommendation connected with IHD prevention. Currently, in majority of wealthy countries the higher IHD prevalence is connected with lower social class. To assess the relationship between analyzed social factors (social background, education of father and subject himself and character of activity at work), marital status and self evaluation of the health status on the one hand and on the other hand classical IHD risk factors and death both total and cardiovascular. The basis of analyses constituted the results of examined in 1984, 1988 and 1993 independent 3 random samples of Warsaw population aged 35-64 years, the study conducted within the framework of the <e>Pol</e>-MONICA Warsaw Project. The screened population was followed up to 1998 from the death and its cause point of view. To the lower social class were included persons with peasant or blue collar worker social background, subjects, whose father's or himself had not finished the elementary education, and whose employment required very heavy physical work. Separately the analysis dealt with marital status and self assessment of health status. The lower social class was characterized by higher BMI and higher prevalence of obesity, higher heart frequency, higher level of systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure as well as prevalence of hypertension and higher HDL-C level. Higher social class was characterized by higher height and higher prevalence of cigarettes smoking. Married persons were characterized by higher weight and height as well as BMI. Persons who evaluated health status as bad or poor had lower height but higher systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure as well as prevalence of hypertension than the reference characteristics. Regardless that 18 characteristics (social factors and classical risk factors) were introduced previously into the regression model to evaluate the risk of death, in female population only lack of employment and poor assessments of health status out of social factors increased the overall risk of death; the risk of cardiovascular death increased with higher level of education, employment required heavy physical activity, not--maried status and poor or bad evaluation of health status, while compared with risk of reference characteristics. Among men the overall risk of death was connected with blue collar type of work, widow or divorced status, employment required heavy physical activity and poor or bad evaluation of health status. The risk of IHD death was connected with widow or not--married status, education at least college and poor or bad assessment of health status. One should conclude that currently in Poland the higher risk of death began to be transferred to lower social class.",M2

The investigated group consisted of 170 persons, 92 males and 78 females aged 41-69 years (mean age 62.0+/-5.11). The observed frequency of apolipoprotein E alleles was: epsilon2 - 7.6%, epsilon3 - 81.8% and epsilon4 - 10.6%, which was similar to frequencies in the neighbouring European countries. Statistically significant lower means of total cholesterol (TC) and of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in epsilon2 carriers and higher means of TC, of LDL-C and of triglycerides in epsilon4 carriers were observed as compared with noncarriers of respective alleles. Some nonlipid cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension (HT) and obesity) and coronary heart disease (CHD) showed a tendency to lower prevalence in the epsilon2 allele carriers as compared to noncarriers. In the epsilon4 allele carriers a tendency to higher prevalence of HT, but not of CHD was observed as compared to noncarriers of this allele.",M2

The lipids were determined by enzymatic methods in laboratory controlled by CDC Lipid Standardization Program in Atlanta. In the screened sample the observed levels of total cholesterol (5.76 +/- 1.01 and 5.68 +/- 1.03 mmol/l respectively in men and in women) and LDL cholesterol (3.67 +/- 0.90 and 3.56 +/- 0.94 mmol/l respectively) were rather high what can indicate on rather high coronary risk of Warsaw population. On the other hand the high mean level of HDL cholesterol (1.36 +/- 0.36 and 1.53 +/- 0.35 mmol/l respectively) and its subfractions HDL2 (0.24 in men and 0.39 mmol/l in women) as well as HDL3 (1.12 and 1.14 mmol/l respectively) observed in this sample can decrease this global risk.

In Warsaw population 2646 inhabitants aged 35-64 years were examined. Ischaemic heart disease was diagnosed in 30% screened persons. Only 39% of subjects were involved in taking cardiovascular drugs. In ischaemic heart disease the drugs used most frequently were pentaerythritol tetranitrate and dipyridamole. The influence of several psychosocial factors on the fact of undertaking of pharmacological therapy was analysed using multivariant logistic function method. Significant relationships were found for age, health self-care self-estimation of health status and fact of medical consultation.

11126349,"Weight gain and its correlates in Poland between 1983 and 1993.BACKGROUND: Weight gain and its unfavorable consequences on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk have been observed worldwide. Determinants of weight gain were studied in a Polish cohort of 1042 men and women age 35-64 at baseline. Participants were randomly selected from an urban population in Warsaw and a rural population in Tarnobrzeg Province surveyed by investigators in Krakow. The surveys, part of the <e>Pol</e>-MONICA project, were conducted in 1983-1984, 1987-1988, and 1992-1993. The purpose of this report is to gain insight into the dynamics of weight gain in this population that could be helpful in identifying high-risk groups for intervention, and to determine if economic changes that took place shortly after the second survey had any impact on weight gain. METHODS: Weight, height and demographic characteristics were measured at each visit according to Pol-MONICA standard protocol. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as kg/m2. Years of schooling, 7-day alcohol history and smoking history were self-reported. RESULTS: Sixty percent of the cohort gained some weight, averaging 0.3-0.7kg/y. Weight gain was highest in younger rural women, in urban men and in rural women with low education. In multiple linear regression, low education was related to a 1.29 kg greater weight gain (P&lt;0.01), ex-smoking status was related to a 2.54 kg greater weight gain (P&lt;0.001), and younger age was related to a 1.14 kg greater weight gain (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a need to target intervention programs at young low SES adults. Developing effective means of reaching these vulnerable groups is a critical research goal.",M2
10439881,"Low-dose glucose-insulin-potassium is ineffective in acute myocardial infarction: results of a randomized multicenter <e>Pol</e>-GIK trial.We aimed to assess the clinical efficacy of glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) in acute myocardial infarction. Experimental data provided evidence of the beneficial effects of GIK on ischemic myocardium. The clinical trials, mostly uncontrolled and conducted mainly before the thrombolytic era, were inconclusive due to the small number of patients and discrepancies in protocols. In order to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention, we have performed a prospective multicenter randomized study. The study consisted of 954 patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) randomized within 24 hours from the onset of symptoms to low-dose GIK (n = 494), which consisted of 1000 mL 10% dextrose, 32-20 U insulin, and 80 mEq K-, or to the control group (n = 460), which was given 1000 mL 0.89% sodium chloride, by intravenous 24-hour infusion at a rate of 42 mL/h.

Project to test exposure to risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the studied sample]Dementia is found in a small percent of general population but remains a significant problem in the elderly population. Little is known whether prevention of dementia in the elderly is possible. Some evidence exists that both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's type dementia are related to cardiovascular disease risk factors. The main goal of the CASCADE Kraków Project is to study the relation between the exposure to cardiovascular disease risk factors in the middle age and cognitive impairment and cerebral white matter lesions in old age. Project CASCADE Kraków is an independent part of the international project CASCADE, which is carried out in 11 research centres from 9 countries. Polish part of the study includes a longitudinal observation of the sample screened earlier in <e>POL</e>-MONICA Kraków Project, which was selected from population of residents of rural province (Tarnobrzeg Voivodship). Studied sample are 1318 persons, for whom cardiovascular disease risk factors were measured in 1983-84 and who completed at least 64 years in 1997. Two-stage examination was designed. In the first stage collection of the following data was designed: socio-economic factors, history of cardiovascular disease, perceived health, blood pressure and cognitive function assessment using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) procedure. In the second stage (sub-sample of 300 persons included) the following procedures were designed: detailed neuro-psychological testing, neurolo-gical examination, MRI, determination of total- and HDL-cholesterol and determination of apoE isoforms. There were 625 (47%) men and 693 (53%) women selected for the first stage. Out of them 128 (43%) men and 172 (57%) women were selected for the second stage. There were no important differences in age, education, health status and exposure to cardiovascular disease risk factors between the studied groups in the baseline assessment. However, there were important differences between men and women. Compared to men, women had lower education (higher than elementary education in 17% and 9% respectively), more frequent obesity (respectively 12% and 36%), hypertension (respectively 57% and 71%) and hyperlipoproteinemia (respectively 17% and 30%) but lower smoking rate (respectively 53% and 4%). Integration of neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging with the epidemiological approach to risk factors could contribute to better understanding of the mechanisms on which the disease affects the brain morphology and functions. The results of CASCADE and CASCADE Kraków projects will contribute also to the development of the strategies of medical care and management of the cognitive impairment in the elderly.",M2
10215280,"Comparison of medical care and survival of hospitalized patients with acute myocardial infarction in Poland and the United States.Few studies have evaluated between-country differences in medical care and survival after acute myocardial infarction, and none have compared the US with countries from Eastern Europe. Comparable data from the US (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study [US-ARIC]) and Poland (Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease project [<e>Pol</e>-MONICA]) were developed. From 1987 through 1993, a total of 3,694 patients were hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction events in the 2 Pol-MONICA communities and 4,801 in the 4 US-ARIC communities. Patients in the US-ARIC were 1.7 times more likely to be treated in a coronary care unit and received cardiac procedures, calcium channel blockers, and thrombolytic agents significantly more often than patients in the Pol-MONICA. The use of antiplatelet agents, nitrates, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta blockade agents was similar in both countries. Case fatality (28-day) rates after hospitalized acute myocardial infarction were nearly identical (men, 7% in Pol-MONICA vs 6% in US-ARIC; women, 9% in Pol-MONICA vs 8% in US-ARIC). However, when fatal coronary heart disease events not associated with a hospitalized myocardial infarction were included, the US-ARIC rates were less than half than those seen in Pol-MONICA. Substantial differences in treatment of hospitalized acute myocardial infarction between countries did not translate into a survival advantage for patients reaching clinical attention. Differences in case severity, arising from the high out-of-hospital coronary death rate in Poland may play an important role in this finding.",M2
9465988,"Poland and U.S. collaborative study on cardiovascular epidemiology hypertension in the community: prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in the <e>Pol</e>-MONICA Project and the U.S. Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.PURPOSE: The objectives of this manuscript are to assess differences in blood pressure levels and in hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control for selected rural and urban areas in the U.S. and Poland, where ischemic heart disease mortality trends are different. METHODS: Included are white persons aged 45-64 selected in Minneapolis, MN suburbs [urban] and Washington County, MD [semi-rural] from the U.S. Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) surveyed in 1987-89, and in Warsaw [urban] and Tarnobrzeg Province [semi-rural] from Poland's Pol-MONICA Project surveyed in 1987-88. Sample sizes were: U.S.--3,696 men, 3,801 women; Poland--875 men, 960 women. RESULTS: Mean blood pressures were &gt; 15% higher for Polish samples than for the U.S. (p &lt; 0.01). In multivariable analysis, hypertension was significantly positively related to age and body mass index (BMI) in both U.S. and Polish samples (except age in Polish men), and to heart rate in Polish samples and U.S. rural women. Smoking was significantly negatively related to hypertension in urban Polish and rural U.S. men. Hypertension awareness, treatment, and control were better in U.S. than in Polish samples. In the U.S. &gt; 80% of subjects with hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; or = 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; or = 95 mmHg or on treatment) were controlled whereas in Polish samples &lt; or = 17% of hypertensive men and 16% of hypertensive women were controlled. When SBP &gt; or = 140 mmHg or DBP &gt; or = 90 mmHg or on treatment defined hypertension, control was about 55% in U.S. samples and about 2% in Polish samples. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension prevalence is higher and blood pressure levels are less well controlled in Polish than in U.S. samples. These striking differences can be expected to contribute to opposing trends in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in the two countries. Hypertension control programs in the U.S. are almost certainly responsible for much of the observed differences. There is a clear need for similar programs in Poland.",M2
9099191,"Stroke mortality rates in Poland did not decline between 1984 and 1992.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke mortality has decreased in most industrialized countries in recent decades. In Poland, as in other eastern European countries, mortality rates for stroke remain high. METHODS: The Warsaw Stroke Registry (WSR) registered patients in the Mokotów district of Warsaw from 1991 through 1992. The Warsaw <e>Pol</e>-MONICA study registered stroke patients in the North and South Praga regions of Warsaw from 1984 through 1992. Stroke incidence rates, case-fatality rates, and stroke mortality rates were computed based on both studies and compared with published mortality rates based on death certificates. Eight-year trends of stroke incidence, case-fatality rate, and mortality were derived from the Warsaw Pol-MONICA study. RESULTS: The WSR and Warsaw Pol-MONICA studies showed similar incidence rates, mortality rates, and 28-day case-fatality rates for stroke. Mortality rates from the WSR and the Warsaw Pol-MONICA study were similar to rates from death certificate data. Mortality rates in the group aged 35 to 64 years were higher in men (47.5 to 50/100000 per year) than in women (30/100000 per year). CONCLUSIONS: Two different population-based studies suggest that stroke mortality is high in Poland because of high 28-day case-fatality rates. Stroke mortality failed to decline in Poland in the period 1984 through 1992 because neither case fatality nor stroke incidence declined in this period.",M2
9099399,"Changes over time in blood lipids and their correlates in Polish rural and urban populations: the Poland-United States Collaborative Study in cardiopulmonary disease epidemiology.PURPOSE: The purpose of this manuscript is to examine changes in blood lipid levels and related factors between 1983 and 1987 in two selected Polish populations, to evaluate these changes and their association with other coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors, and to examine the nutrient intake changes for consistency with observed lipid changes. METHODS: Men and women, aged 35-64 were screened from Warsaw and rural Tarnobrzeg province, Poland-the <e>Pol</e>-MONICA screening sites. An independent random sample of 5132 screened in 1983-84 and a second independent random sample of 2596 screened in 1987-88 were compared. A 25% cohort of the 1983-84 sample was also rescreened in 1987-88 (n = 1236) and 24-hour dietary recall information on this cohort was used to evaluate nutrient intake changes and their relationship to the lipid changes. RESULTS: For the random samples, the total cholesterol increased by 5.1 mg/dL (rural) and by 7.9 mg/dL (urban) for women; there were no significant changes among men. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) increased for all site and gender subgroups by 5.4-8.7 mg/dL. Among rural men and women, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) decreased by 3.4 and 3.3 mg/dL, respectively, whereas it increased by 3.3 mg/dL among urban women and did not change among urban men. Total triglycerides (TG) increased by 9.5 mg/dL for rural men, with no significant change for rural women. For urban men and women, TG decreased by 29.5 and 21.8 mg/dL respectively. In the cohort, changes in dietary intake (decreases in energy from fat, Keys index and increases in the polyunsaturated to saturated fats ratio) were related to a decrease in TC at both sites and to a decrease or smaller increase in LDL-C for rural men. CONCLUSIONS: The observed changes were generally unfavorable, with a decrease in the proportion of persons with desirable lipid levels. At both sites nutritional changes were favorable, including a drop in total energy intake. Less pronounced were changes in percentages of total energy from fats, where the only significant decrease was for rural women; however, improvements in dietary fat composition and declines in cholesterol consumption were found. These favorable changes in diet were not strong enough or were not in effect long enough to counter the unfavorable changes in blood lipids.",M2

This paper presents the complex analysis of 10-year trends of incidence, case fatality and mortality due to myocardial infarction (MI) and changes in medical care in the acute phase of MI in residents of one province of Poland-Tarnobrzeg Voivodship, which was the target population of the POL-MONICA Kraków Project (over 280,000 men and women at age 25-64 years). In men, the incidence of MI, which was 335/100,000 in 1984, increased in 1986 to 463/1,000,000 and then was stable until 1993 when it felt to 362/100,000. Mortality from MI, which was 149/100,000 in 1984, increased to 212/100,000 in 1986 and then was stable until 1992, before falling to 173/100,000 in 1993. There were large fluctuations in the incidence and mortality from MI in women i.e. from 58/100,000 to 116/100,000 and from 21/100,000 to 55/100,000 respectively. In 1993 the incidence was 82/100,000 and mortality was 32/100,000. After adding sudden deaths and other fatal events attributed to IHD the mortality figures increased over the ten years of observation by an average of 29% in men and by 28% in women. The average total MI case fatality was 47% in men and 40% in women, with 86% of all deaths due to MI occurring out of hospital. Case-fatality of MI managed in hospital was 11% on average.",M2

All deaths were registered according to the cause of death based on death certificate diagnosis. The proportional hazard Cox model was used for univariate heart rate (HR) analysis and for multivariate analysis after adjustment for covariates (HR divided into 4 subgroups). Out of screened subjects 263 persons died (139 due to cardiovascular disease CVD). Mean baseline HR of persons who died was 76.8 (+/- 11.5) versus 73.9 (+/- 10.2) for subjects who survived (p = 0.0001). In the univariate analysis the heart rate was significantly positively related both to all cause mortality (relative risk RR = 1.29, p = 0.0001) as well as to cardiovascular mortality (RR = 1.31, p = 0.0025). In the multivariate analysis HR was significantly positively related to all cause mortality (standardized RR = 1.24, p = 0.0012), but almost significantly related to cardiovascular mortality (SRR = 1.20, p = 0.052).",M2

9199127,"[Evaluation of using statistical methods in selected national medical journals]The paper covers the performed evaluation of frequency with which the statistical methods were applied in analyzed works having been published in six selected, national medical journals in the years 1988-1992. For analysis the following journals were chosen, namely: Klinika Oczna, Medycyna Pracy, Pediatria Polska, Polski Tygodnik Lekarski, Roczniki Państwowego Zakładu Higieny, Zdrowie Publiczne. Appropriate number of works up to the average in the remaining medical journals was randomly selected from respective volumes of <e>Pol</e>. Tyg. Lek. The studies did not include works wherein the statistical analysis was not implemented, which referred both to national and international publications. That exemption was also extended to review papers, casuistic ones, reviews of books, handbooks, monographies, reports from scientific congresses, as well as papers on historical topics. The number of works was defined in each volume. Next, analysis was performed to establish the mode of finding out a suitable sample in respective studies, differentiating two categories: random and target selections. Attention was also paid to the presence of control sample in the individual works. In the analysis attention was also focussed on the existence of sample characteristics, setting up three categories: complete, partial and lacking. In evaluating the analyzed works an effort was made to present the results of studies in tables and figures (Tab. 1, 3). Analysis was accomplished with regard to the rate of employing statistical methods in analyzed works in relevant volumes of six selected, national medical journals for the years 1988-1992, simultaneously determining the number of works, in which no statistical methods were used. Concurrently the frequency of applying the individual statistical methods was analyzed in the scrutinized works. Prominence was given to fundamental statistical methods in the field of descriptive statistics (measures of position, measures of dispersion) as well as most important methods of mathematical statistics such as parametric tests of significance, analysis of variance (in single and dual classifications). non-parametric tests of significance, correlation and regression. The works, in which use was made of either multiple correlation or multiple regression or else more complex methods of studying the relationship for two or more numbers of variables, were incorporated into the works whose statistical methods were constituted by correlation and regression as well as other methods, e.g. statistical methods being used in epidemiology (coefficients of incidence and morbidity, standardization of coefficients, survival tables) factor analysis conducted by Jacobi-Hotellng's method, taxonomic methods and others. On the basis of the performed studies it has been established that the frequency of employing statistical methods in the six selected national, medical journals in the years 1988-1992 was 61.1-66.0% of the analyzed works (Tab. 3), and they generally were almost similar to the frequency provided in English language medical journals. On a whole, no significant differences were disclosed in the frequency of applied statistical methods (Tab. 4) as well as in frequency of random tests (Tab. 3) in the analyzed works, appearing in the medical journals in respective years 1988-1992. The most frequently used statistical methods in analyzed works for 1988-1992 were the measures of position 44.2-55.6% and measures of dispersion 32.5-38.5% as well as parametric tests of significance 26.3-33.1% of the works analyzed (Tab. 4). For the purpose of increasing the frequency and reliability of the used statistical methods, the didactics should be widened in the field of biostatistics at medical studies and postgraduation training designed for physicians and scientific-didactic workers.",M2

Mean values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased in both sexes with age, however diastolic blood pressure increased only up to age 45-54 years. Prevalence of hypertension according to WHO criteria was higher in men than in women and in both sexes increased with age. Among subjects with hypertension the mild diastolic hypertension was most frequent. The high percentage of subjects with hypertension at screening was not previously detected (47.4% men and 27.6% women).

A comparison of HDL cholesterol and its subfractions in populations covered by the United States Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study and the <e>Pol</e>-MONICA Project.HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are inversely related to coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, and HDL-C distributions vary among countries. Poland is one of the few developed countries in which CHD rates are increasing at the same time that US rates have been falling, but whether these differences are explained by differences in risk factors such as HDL-C has not been determined. To examine this possibility, levels of HDL-C and its subfractions were compared in US and Polish urban and rural men and women aged 45 to 64 years. Age-adjusted HDL-C means were 0.20 mmol/L higher in urban Polish men and 0.37 mmol/L higher in rural Polish men than in their US counterparts (P &lt; .0001); means in urban Polish women were 0.06 mmol/L higher (P &lt; .05) and in rural Polish women 0.09 mmol/L higher (P &lt; .001) than in their US counterparts. Adjustment for age, education, alcohol intake, smoking, BMI, heart rate, and menopause status (in women) had little effect on differences. Means of HDL2 and HDL3 levels showed similar between-country differences, although differences were minimal for HDL2 in urban men and women, and HDL3 means did not differ between rural women. BMI was inversely related to HDL-C and both subfractions in all gender-country-site strata (P &lt; .001), and alcohol was directly related to HDL-C (P &lt; .001) in all strata except Polish women. Cigarette smoking was negatively related to HDL-C and both subfractions in all US samples except HDL2 in urban men, whereas in Polish samples, significant associations were found only in urban women for HDL-C and in rural and urban women for HDL3. Age, heart rate, and education showed inconsistent or no association with HDL-C and its subfractions in either country. This profile of HDL-C and its subfractions in Polish samples contrasts sharply with the opposite trend in CHD mortality rates, which suggests either that other risk factors may account for the trends or that the relationship between HDL-C and CHD may differ between the two countries.",M2

The smoking intensity was higher in the agricultural areas both among men and women. It has been stated that smoking habit depends on such social or demographic patterns as age, sex, civil state, education, physical activity related to work. Smoking influenced significantly the level of such risk factors as systolic arterial blood pressure, the fat body content in both men and women, and the HDL-cholesterol in women from both environments.",M2
