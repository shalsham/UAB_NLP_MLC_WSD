20509909,"Prevalence of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi sensu lato in rodents from Gansu, northwestern China.BACKGROUND: Lyme disease is a multi-organ infection disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Lyme disease was first documented in north-east China in 1986. Since then more than 20 provinces in China were confirmed the existence of nature foci of Lyme disease. In the present study, a molecular epidemiological survey was conducted to investigate the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in rodents from Gansu Province for the first time. RESULT: A total of 140 rodents of 7 species were examined for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. by nested-PCR and culture isolation. The overall infection rate was 22.86%. Two rodent species most frequently trapped were responsible for all positive. 3 strains were isolated from Apodemus agrarius, which belonged to B. garinii, 1 strain isolated from Rattus losea was identified as B. afzelii. CONCLUSION: The study firstly showed the role of rodents in maintaining the pathogen of Lyme disease in the environment from Gansu Province and there existed at least two genotypes of Lyme disease spirochaetes in rodents.",M1
20507740,"Evolution of northeastern and midwestern <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi, United States.The per capita incidence of human Lyme disease in the northeastern United States is more than twice that in the Midwest. However, the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, in the tick vector is nearly identical in the 2 regions. The disparity in human Lyme disease incidence may result from a disparity in the human invasiveness of the bacteria in the Northeast and Midwest caused by fundamentally different evolutionary histories. B. burgdorferi populations in the Northeast and Midwest are geographically isolated, enabling evolutionary divergence in human invasiveness. However, we found that B. burgdorferi populations in the Northeast and Midwest shared a recent common ancestor, which suggests that substantial evolutionary divergence in human invasiveness has not occurred. We propose that differences in either animal ecology or human behavior are the root cause of the differences in human incidence between the 2 regions.",M1
20496594,"Forest and surface water as predictors of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi and its vector Ixodes scapularis (Acari: Ixodidae) in Indiana.The objective of this study was to assess whether the distribution of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, and its vector tick Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) across Indiana is influenced by large-scale landscape features, specifically the proportion of forest within the surrounding landscape and the distance to water features such as lakes and major streams. Hunter-killed deer were checked for ticks in designated check-stations in the opening firearm hunting season between 2005 and 2007. Hunting locations for approximately 3,600 deer were used in ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA) to examine the influence of forest and water features in the surrounding area on the occurrence of the tick and bacteria. In total, 82 of the 92 (89%) Indiana counties were sampled from 2005 to 2007. The proportion of tick-infested deer was 13.6, 15.8, and 25.5% in these years, respectively. There was a significant nonlinear response for I. scapularis to forest cover in 1 yr that indicated a greater probability of this tick presence at intermediate levels of forest area. Infested does were harvested in significantly more forested areas than bucks. No significant correlation was found neither between levels of forest area and B. burgdorferi nor between water bodies and both organisms.",M1
20483726,"Invariant NKT cell development requires a full complement of functional CD3 zeta immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs.Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells regulate early immune responses to infections, in part because of their rapid release of IFN-gamma and IL-4. iNKT cells are proposed to reduce the severity of Lyme disease following <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi infection. Unlike conventional T cells, iNKT cells express an invariant alphabeta TCR that recognizes lipids bound to the MHC class I-like molecule, CD1d. Furthermore, these cells are positively selected following TCR interactions with glycolipid/CD1d complexes expressed on CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Whereas conventional T cell development can proceed with as few as 4/10 CD3 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), little is known about the ITAM requirements for iNKT cell selection and expansion. We analyzed iNKT cell development in CD3 zeta transgenic lines with various tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions (YF) that eliminated the functions of the first (YF1,2), third (YF5,6), or all three (YF1-6) CD3 zeta ITAMs. iNKT cell numbers were significantly reduced in the thymus, spleen, and liver of all YF mice compared with wild type mice. The reduced numbers of iNKT cells resulted from significant reductions in the expression of the early growth response 2 and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger transcription factors. In the mice with few to no iNKT cells, there was no difference in the severity of Lyme arthritis compared with wild type controls, following infections with the spirochete B. burgdorferi. These findings indicate that a full complement of functional CD3 zeta ITAMs is required for effective iNKT cell development.",M1
20441518,"Recognition of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi by NOD2 is central for the induction of an inflammatory reaction.Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) plays an important role in the recognition of Borrelia bacteria, the causative agent of Lyme disease, but the existence and importance of additional receptors in this process has been hypothesized. In the present study, we confirmed the role played by TLR2 in the recognition of Borrelia bacteria but also demonstrated a crucial role for the intracellular peptidoglycan receptor NOD2 for sensing the spirochete. Cells from individuals who were homozygous for the loss-of-function mutation 3020insC in the NOD2 gene were defective with respect to cytokine release after stimulation with Borrelia species, and this was confirmed in peritoneal macrophages from mice lacking RICK, the adaptor molecule used by NOD2. In contrast, NOD1 played no major role in the recognition of Borrelia spirochetes. This raises the intriguing possibility that recognition of Borrelia spirochetes is exerted by TLR2 in combination with NOD2 and that both receptors are necessary for an effective induction of cytokines by Borrelia species. The interplay between TLR2 and NOD2 might not only be necessary for the induction of a proper immune response but may also contribute to inflammatory-induced pathology.",M1
20437826,"Our experience with examination of antibodies against antigens of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi in patients with suspected lyme disease.BACKGROUND: Lyme borreliosis is a multisystemic disease which affects several organs such as skin, nervous system, joints and the heart. The presented study focused on patients with persisting symptoms of the disease, which could be in correlation with Lyme disease but antiborrelial antibodies were not confirmed by screening tests. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 32 patients with anamnestic data and suspected clinical signs of lyme borreliosis were tested for the presence of antiborrelia antibodies by using ELISA and westernblot analysis and the state of cellular and humoral immunity. RESULTS: All patients had specific antiborrelial antibodies confirmed by using the westernblot in spite of negative ELISA. Immunological investigations revealed a deficiency of cellular immunity in all patients and in a part of them (15.6%) a deficiency of humoral immunity was also found. The presence of different types of autoantibodies was detected in 17 (53.1%) patients. CONCLUSION: In patients with persisting difficulties that could be associated with Lyme disease, it is necessary to use the westernblot test which could prove the presence of specific antibodies. It is probably due to the very low production of specific antibodies caused also by the status of immune deficiency detected in all our patients (Tab. 1, Ref. 11).",M1
20421380,"Role of the surface lipoprotein BBA07 in the enzootic cycle of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi.Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease pathogen, dramatically alters its protein profile when it is transmitted between ticks and mammals. Several differentially expressed proteins have been shown to be critical for the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi. In this study, we demonstrated that expression of the surface lipoprotein-encoding gene bba07 is induced by an elevated temperature and a reduced pH during in vitro cultivation, as well as during nymphal tick feeding. Expression of bba07 is regulated by the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway, a central regulatory network that is activated during nymphal feeding. By generating a bba07 mutant of an infectious strain of B. burgdorferi, we demonstrated that although BBA07-deficient spirochetes were capable of infecting mice via needle inoculation and surviving in ticks, they were defective in infection of mammals via tick transmission. Complementation of the bba07 mutant with a wild-type copy of bba07 partially restored the transmission defect of the bba07 mutant. Based on these findings, we concluded that the surface lipoprotein BBA07 is produced during tick feeding and facilitates optimal transmission of B. burgdorferi from the tick vector to a mammalian host.",M1
20404081,"The Lyme disease spirochete <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi utilizes multiple ligands, including RNA, for interferon regulatory factor 3-dependent induction of type I interferon-responsive genes.We recently discovered a critical role for type I interferon (IFN) in the development of murine Lyme arthritis. Borrelia burgdorferi-mediated induction of IFN-responsive genes by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) was dependent upon a functional type I IFN receptor but independent of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, TLR9, and the adapter molecule MyD88. We now demonstrate that induction of the IFN transcriptional profile in B. burgdorferi-stimulated BMDMs occurs independently of the adapter TRIF and of the cytoplasmic sensor NOD2. In contrast, B. burgdorferi-induced transcription of these genes was dependent upon a rapid STAT1 feedback amplification pathway. IFN profile gene transcription was IRF3 dependent but did not utilize B. burgdorferi-derived DNA or DNase-sensitive ligands. Instead, IFN-responsive gene expression could be induced by B. burgdorferi-derived RNA. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent IFN profile gene transcription was also induced by sonicated bacteria, by the lipoprotein OspA, and by factors released into the BSKII medium during culture of B. burgdorferi. The IFN-stimulatory activity of B. burgdorferi culture supernatants was not destroyed by nuclease treatment. Nuclease digestion also had no effect on IFN profile induction mediated by sonicated B. burgdorferi. Thus, B. burgdorferi-derived RNA, OspA, and non-nucleic acid ligands present in both sonicated bacteria and B. burgdorferi culture medium contribute to type I IFN-responsive gene induction. These findings suggest that B. burgdorferi invasion of joint tissue and the resultant type I IFN induction associated with Lyme arthritis development may involve multiple triggering ligands.",M1
20380218,"Community ecology and disease risk: lizards, squirrels, and the Lyme disease spirochete in California, USA.Vector-borne zoonotic diseases are often maintained in complex transmission cycles involving multiple vertebrate hosts and their arthropod vectors. In the state of California, U.S.A., the spirochete <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, is transmitted between vertebrate hosts by the western black-legged tick, Ixodes pacificus. Several mammalian species serve as reservoir hosts of the spirochete, but levels of tick infestation, reservoir competence, and Borrelia-infection prevalence vary widely among such hosts. Here, we model the host (lizards, Peromyscus mice, Californian meadow voles, dusky-footed wood rats, and western gray squirrels), vector, and pathogen community of oak woodlands in northwestern California to determine the relative importance of different tick hosts. Observed infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi in host-seeking I. pacificus nymphs was 1.8-5.3%, and our host-community model estimated an infection prevalence of 1.6-2.2%. The western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus) was the only source of infected nymphs. Lizards, which are refractory to Borrelia infection, are important in feeding subadult ticks but reduce disease risk (nymphal infection prevalence). Species identity is therefore critical in understanding and determining the local disease ecology.",M1
20377044,"Direct detection of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi spirochetes in patients with early disseminated Lyme borreliosis.The detection of spirochetes in 15 patients with clinically documented early disseminated LB has been analysed when using cultivation method of the plasma or the cerebrospinal fluid, electron microscopy, commercial Western blot and detecting the DNA of the pathogen in vitro cultures by PCR-RFLP. Spirochetes were isolated in eight blood and one cerebrospinal fluid culture samples. In seven cases (47%), previous serodiagnostic laboratory tests were negative. Borrelial DNA was detected by PCR in 67% patients (9 blood samples and 1 CSF sample). Using Msel restriction fragments of PCR products of the amplified rrf-rrl region, we identified Borrelia garinii (80%), one B. afzelii isolate and one B. burgdorferi s.s.",M1
20369737,"[Presence of antibodies against gangliosides among patients with Lyme borreliosis--preliminary study]THE AIM of the study was the evaluation of autoantibody reaction against endogenous gangliosides in the course of Lyme borreliosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antibodies against profile of gangliosides composed of GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a,GD1b,GT1b, GQ1b were evaluated in serum patients with early disseminated (neuroborreliosis) Lyme disease (n = 16), patients with long lasting serologic response against <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi (n = 32) and in healthy subjects (n = 16). Immunoblot test for IgG was used. RESULTS: Antibodies were detected in all evaluated groups. In group of neuroborreliosis (lymphocytic meningitis with cranial nerve invoIvement) there was no essential difference with control group. It was stated in group of forestry workers with serological features of infection B. burgdorferi lasting for years. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the study do not support the thesis of participation of IgG autoantibodies against gangliosides in pathogenesis early disseminated Lyme borreliosis in form of lymphocytic meningitis with cranial nerves paresis. Antibodies against endogenous glicosfingolipides in Lyme borreliosis probably can lead to affecting nervous system (demielinisation and polineuropathy) but probably require long-term immunization, what is suggested by results of examined group of patients with the multi-annual serological features of infection.",M1
20369726,"[Coexisting of borreliosis, depression and psoriasis--case report]Lyme disease is a multisystem infectious disease with a wide variety of symptoms involving the skin as well as the nervous system. Lyme disease is caused by spirochaete <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi transmitted by Ixodes ticks in endemic regions. A case of 45 year old woman suffering from borreliosis, psoriasis and depression is presented in the paper. In the study a standardized screening list was applied to evaluate the psychiatric health state--Classification of Psychic Disorders (DSM-IV) and Hamilton Scale. Patient was diagnosed with a major depressive episode (MDE) according to DSM-IV Diagnosis Criteria. Patient obtained a score 21 on the 24-item in Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression.

20368453,"The bba64 gene of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent, is critical for mammalian infection via tick bite transmission.The spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted by bites of Ixodes ticks to mammalian reservoir hosts and humans. The mechanism(s) by which the organism is trafficked from vector to host is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that a B. burgdorferi mutant strain deficient in the synthesis of the bba64 gene product was incapable of infecting mice via tick bite even though the mutant was (i) infectious in mice when introduced by needle inoculation, (ii) acquired by larval ticks feeding on infected mice, and (iii) able to persist through tick molting stages. This finding of a B. burgdorferi gene required for pathogen transfer and/or survival from the tick to the susceptible host represents an important breakthrough toward understanding transmission mechanisms involved for the Lyme disease agent.",M1
20364477,"[Genotyping some <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi sensu lato isolates from Ixodes ricinus ticks in Russia and Ukraine]The 4 Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato isolates obtained from 1. Ricinus ticks collected in the natural foci in Russia and Ukraine, having an unusual RFLP Msel-pattern, were studied using sequencing rrfA-rrlB spacer and rrs gene. The Ir-5215 isolate from the tick collected in southern Ukraine represented recently described genospecies B. spielmanii pathogenic for humans. The three atypical isolates Ir-3519, Ir-4721, and Ir-4812 had 100% identity with the sequence of the atypical European B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains. They constituted a subgroup of the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto on the grounds of Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA). These data can be indicative of the genetic heterogeneity of the current group B. burgdorferi sensu stricto.",M1
20357256,"Disordered lymphoid purine metabolism contributes to the pathogenesis of persistent <e>Borrelia</e> garinii infection in mice.Extracellular ATP and adenosine are important regulators of immune responses; however, contribution of purinergic signaling to host defense during persistent microbial infections remains obscure. Lyme borreliosis is a common arthropod-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. In this study, we investigated whether lymphoid purinergic signaling contributes to the mechanisms by which borreliae species evade the immune system and trigger joint inflammation. Intracutaneous inoculation of Borrelia garinii to C3H/He mice induced symptomatic infection manifested in elevated levels of borrelia-specific IgG Abs, persistent spirochete dissemination into the tissues and joint swelling, as well as approximately 2- to 2.5-fold enlargement of draining lymph nodes with hyperplasia of B cell follicle area and L-selectin shedding from activated T lymphocytes. Purine catabolism was also activated in lymph nodes but not spleen and blood of infected C3H/He mice within the first 4 postinfection weeks, particularly manifested in transient upregulations of adenosine triphosphatase/ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase and ecto-5'-nucleotidase/CD73 on CD4(+)CD8(+) T lymphocytes and adenosine deaminase activity on B220(+) B lymphocytes. Compared with borrelia-susceptible C3H/He strain, lymphocytes from C57BL/6 mice displayed markedly enhanced adenosine-generating capability due to approximately three times higher ratio of ecto-5'-nucleotidase to adenosine deaminase. Borrelia-infected C57BL/6 mice efficiently eradicated the inoculated spirochetes at more chronic stage without any signs of arthritis. Strikingly, deletion of key adenosine-generating enzyme, ecto-5'-nucleotidase/CD73, was accompanied by significantly enhanced joint swelling in borrelia-infected CD73-deficient C57BL/6 mice. Collectively, these data suggest that insufficient basal adenosine level and/or pathogen-induced disordered lymphoid purine homeostasis may serve as important prerequisite for promotion of inflammatory responses and further host's commitment to persistence of bacterial infection and arthritis development.",M1
20237200,"One-year duration of immunity induced by vaccination with a canine Lyme disease bacterin.Laboratory-reared beagles were vaccinated with a placebo or a bacterin comprised of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi S-1-10 and ospA-negative/ospB-negative B. burgdorferi 50772 and challenged after 1 year with B. burgdorferi-infected Ixodes scapularis ticks. For the placebo recipients, spirochetes were recovered from 9 (60%) skin biopsy specimens collected after 1 month, and the organisms persisted in the skin thereafter. Ten (67%) dogs also developed joint infection (3 dogs), lameness or synovitis (7 dogs), or B. burgdorferi-specific antibodies (8 dogs). For the vaccine recipients, spirochetes were recovered from 6 (40%) skin biopsy specimens collected after 1 month. However, subsequent biopsy specimens were negative, and the dogs failed to develop joint infection (P = 0.224), lameness/synovitis (P = 0.006), or Lyme disease-specific antibody responses (P = 0.002).

20228796,"An intravascular immune response to <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi involves Kupffer cells and iNKT cells.Here we investigate the dynamics of the hepatic intravascular immune response to a pathogen relevant to invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells). Immobilized Kupffer cells with highly ramified extended processes into multiple sinusoids could effectively capture blood-borne, disseminating Borrelia burgdorferi, creating a highly efficient surveillance and filtering system. After ingesting B. burgdorferi, Kupffer cells induced chemokine receptor CXCR3-dependent clustering of iNKT cells. Kupffer cells and iNKT cells formed stable contacts via the antigen-presenting molecule CD1d, which led to iNKT cell activation. An absence of iNKT cells caused B. burgdorferi to leave the blood and enter the joints more effectively. B. burgdorferi that escaped Kupffer cells entered the liver parenchyma and survived despite Ito cell responses. Kupffer cell-iNKT cell interactions induced a key intravascular immune response that diminished the dissemination of B. burgdorferi.",M1
20219882,"Humoral immune response in dogs naturally infected with <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi sensu lato and in dogs after immunization with a Borrelia vaccine.Lyme arthritis in dogs can be induced under experimental and natural conditions. However, the veterinary relevance of canine borreliosis is still under extensive investigation. The prevalence of symptoms is clearly low, although the risk of tick exposure is high. Current research focuses on case definitions, methods for diagnosing clinical disease in dogs, and discrimination between an immune response to a natural infection and an immune response to vaccination. In this experimental study, 23 dogs raised under tick-free conditions were allocated to two groups. The 11 dogs in the first group were vaccinated with a commercial borrelia vaccine and subsequently developed detectable antibody titers. The 12 dogs in the second group were walked on two consecutive days in an area where ticks were endemic. On day 5 after exposure, engorged ticks were removed from the 12 dogs and were analyzed for Borrelia DNA by a real-time PCR assay. Blood samples were taken before exposure/vaccination and at defined time points thereafter. Antibody responses were evaluated using an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and Western blotting. Seven dogs from which Borrelia-positive ticks were removed seroconverted and developed individual immune responses. Blood and urine samples taken from the tick-exposed group at weeks 1 and 3 for real-time PCR analysis and culture were always negative for bacterial DNA. In conclusion, despite serological evidence of infection/immunization, no clinical signs of disease were observed. The antibody patterns in a single Western blot did not permit differentiation between the different antigen sources (vaccine versus natural infection). However, repeated Western blot analyses may be useful for the confirmation of infection or vaccination status, since the time courses of the levels of specific antibodies seem to be different.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recombinant antigens OspC B. garinii and OspC B. afrelii, serum samples from patients with TBB were used as well as solid-phase enzyme immunoassay and parametric and non-parametric statistical methods. RESULTS: Higher antigenic activity of B. garinii OspC compared with OspC from B. afzelii was observed when these recombinant proteins were compared in enzyme immunoassay. Detection rate of class M and G immunoglobulins to B. garinii OspC in sera of patients with TBB was 60.5% and 70% respectively.

Nonetheless, serologic evidence of exposure of dogs to B. burgdorferi agrees with the geographical distribution of autochthonous transmission of the agent of Lyme borreliosis, and continued monitoring of exposure rates in dogs might allow early recognition of geographic expansion of endemic areas as well as identify hyperendemic areas where both humans and dogs are at increased risk of infection.",M1
20146822,"Identification and functional characterisation of Complement Regulator Acquiring Surface Protein-1 of serum resistant <e>Borrelia</e> garinii OspA serotype 4.BACKGROUND: B. burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) is the etiological agent of Lyme borreliosis in humans. Spirochetes have adapted themselves to the human immune system in many distinct ways. One important immune escape mechanism for evading complement activation is the binding of complement regulators Factor H (CFH) or Factor H-like protein1 (FHL-1) to Complement Regulator-Acquiring Surface Proteins (CRASPs). RESULTS: We demonstrate that B. garinii OspA serotype 4 (ST4) PBi resist complement-mediated killing by binding of FHL-1. To identify the primary ligands of FHL-1 four CspA orthologs from B. garinii ST4 PBi were cloned and tested for binding to human CFH and FHL-1. Orthologs BGA66 and BGA71 were found to be able to bind both complement regulators but with different intensities. In addition, all CspA orthologs were tested for binding to mammalian and avian CFH. Distinct orthologs were able to bind to CFH of different animal origins. CONCLUSIONS: B. garinii ST4 PBi is able to evade complement killing and it can bind FHL-1 to membrane expressed proteins. Recombinant proteins BGA66 can bind FHL-1 and human CFH, while BGA71 can bind only FHL-1. All recombinant CspA orthologs from B. garinii ST4 PBi can bind CFH from different animal origins. This partly explains the wide variety of animals that can be infected by B. garinii.",M1

Of 405 patients with endometriosis treated in our study over a 6-year period, 3(0.8%) had Lyme disease. All cases presented with typical erythema migraines, fever and fatigue. The serological findings were positive for <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi, for 3 cases. Two out of 3 women underwent IVF-ET procedures and one of them conceived in the first cycle without complication during pregnancy or after childbirth recorded. We concluded that women with endometriosis are more likely to have chronic fatigue syndrome, systemic lupus erythematous, Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and other autoimmune inflammatory and endocrine diseases.

20143357,"Chemoenzymatic synthesis of a glycolipid library and elucidation of the antigenic epitope for construction of a vaccine against Lyme disease.Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne disease in Europe, North America, and Asia. The etiologic agents of LD are spirochetes of the group <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi sensu lato, which possess a lipid content of 25-30% of the dry weight. The major glycolipid cholesteryl 6-O-acyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ACGal), present in B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, and B. garinii, is a specific and highly prevalent antigen frequently recognized by antibodies in late-stage LD. Here we report a convenient route for the chemical synthesis of ACGal by employing a combination of chemical synthesis steps with enzymatic transformations. This synthesized molecule was compared with bacterial extracts by immunoblots with patient sera, confirming the preserved antigenicity. Next, a glycolipid library derived from the native molecules with variations in the fatty acyl moiety and derivatives in which the cholesterol has been replaced was designed and synthesized. The chemical structures were confirmed by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The native and synthetic glycolipids were utilized in immunoblots to determine the epitope recognized by antibodies in patient sera. By this method we could demonstrate that galactose, cholesterol, and a fatty acid with a minimal chain length of four carbon atoms comprises the essential structure for recognition by antibodies. Finally, this finding allowed the synthesis of a functionalized ACGal with an omega-mercapto group at the fatty acid and a facile protection and deprotection strategy. This antigenic hapten can be conjugated to a carrier protein to effect immunization against Lyme disease.",M1

This study was undertaken in order to evaluate the prevalence of both B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (hereinafter referred to as B. burgdorferi) and A. phagocytophilum in several species of sciurid rodents from northern California, USA. Rodents were either collected dead as road-kills or live-trapped in four state parks from 13 counties. Thirty-seven western gray squirrels (Sciurus griseus), nine nonnative eastern gray squirrels (S. carolinensis) and an eastern fox squirrel (S. niger), four Douglas squirrels (Tamiasciurus douglasii), and two northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology for evidence of coinfection. Of the 14 individual S. griseus that were PCR-positive for B. burgdorferi, two (14%) also were PCR-positive for A. phagocytophilum and 11 (79%) had serologic evidence of A. phagocytophilum exposure. Two of the four Douglas squirrels were PCR positive for B. burgdorferi and seropositive to A. phagocytophilum.

All samples were examined for the presence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi sensu lato and A. phagocytophilum by the use of the SNAP 4DX ELISA test. RESULTS: Overall, 29.0% of the horses were seropositive for B. burgdorferi sensu lato whereas 22.3% were seropositive for A. phagocytophilum. CONCLUSIONS: Antibodies against B burgdorferi sensu lato and A. phagocytophilum are commonly found among Danish horses thus showing that Danish horses are frequently infected by these organisms.",M1
20067594,"Treatment of Lyme borreliosis.ABSTRACT : <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi sensu lato is the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis in humans. This inflammatory disease can affect the skin, the peripheral and central nervous system, the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system and rarely the eyes. Early stages are directly associated with viable bacteria at the site of inflammation. The pathogen-host interaction is complex and has been elucidated only in part. B. burgdorferi is highly susceptible to antibiotic treatment and the majority of patients profit from this treatment. Some patients develop chronic persistent disease despite repeated antibiotics. Whether this is a sequel of pathogen persistence or a status of chronic auto-inflammation, auto-immunity or a form of fibromyalgia is highly debated. Since vaccination is not available, prevention of a tick bite or chemoprophylaxis is important. If the infection is manifest, then treatment strategies should target not only the pathogen by using antibiotics but also the chronic inflammation by using anti-inflammatory drugs.",M1
20052487,"Presence of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi in endomyocardial biopsies in patients with new-onset unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy.Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents the third most common cause of heart failure and the most frequent cause of heart transplantation. Infectious, mostly viral, and autoimmune mechanisms, together with genetic abnormalities, have been reported as three major causes of DCM. We hypothesized that Lyme disease (LD), caused by spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), might be an important cause of new-onset unexplained DCM in patients living in a highly endemic area for LD such as the Czech Republic. We performed endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) in 39 consecutive patients presenting with symptomatic unexplained left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction lasting no more than 12 months. In eight subjects (21%), Bb was detected in the EMB sample by polymerase chain reaction or by electron microscopy. None of these patients exhibited any form of atrioventricular block or other extracardiac manifestation of Bb infection. Serological testing identified IgG antibodies against Bb in only two cases and IgM antibodies in none. All affected patients were treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 3 weeks. At 6 months follow-up, LV morphology and function as well as functional status of these patients significantly improved. In conclusion, Bb infection may represent an important cause of new-onset unexplained DCM in patients living in endemic regions such as the Czech Republic. Because the antibiotic treatment appears to be markedly effective and serological examination does not provide a tool for diagnosing the disease, EMB focused on the detection of Bb should be performed in all patients from endemic areas with new-onset unexplained DCM not responding to conventional therapy.",M1

In Europe, including Slovakia, the principal vector of both pathogens is the common tick - Ixodes ricinus, in which double infections with these pathogens have been reported. The aim of our study was evidence of IgG antibodies against A. phagocytophilum in blood sera of humans with suspects LB from several Clinics of University Hospitals, and the evaluation of the possibility of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum co-infection in examined patients. The serological method ELISA was used to detect IgM and IgG antibodies against B. burgdorferi. Anti-A. phagocytophilum IgG antibodies were analyzed by the A. phagocytophilum Indirect Immunofluorescence Antibody (IFA) IgG test. A total of 214 human samples (91 men, 123 women) were obtained from patients living in Kosice town and in villages around Kosice (Eastern Slovakia). IgG antibodies against A. phagocytophilum were detected in 15 cases (6 men, 9 women), which represented 7.0 % positivity.

A group of 1,155 forestry workers from six forest inspectorates in southern Poland were examined with the immunoenzymatic method (ELISA test). The general level of anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies was 12.8 % in IgM class, and 25 % in IgG class. Markedly more seropositive results were found in the group of fieldworkers (13.8 % - IgM and 25.0 % - IgG) than in office workers (10.0 % - IgM and 13.7 % - IgG). The highest proportions of infections both in IgM and IgG class (17.4 % and 34.8 %, respectively) were recorded in the group of persons over 50 years of age, the lowest - in the group of workers younger than 30 (IgM - 13.0 %, IgG - 14.1%). Significant differences in the level of seropositive results in IgG class were related to the workers' gender - in women the percentage was 9.8 %, in men - 28.1 %.

The data as a basis for this analysis originated from the database on the occupational disease certification created by the Public Health Service in Poznan. Documentation from the years 2000-2007 reviewed. The maximum number of the cases of borreliosis in the territory of Wielkopolska certified as the occupational disease fell in the years 2002-2003.

19998007,"[Pandora's Box: pathogens in Ixodes ricinus ticks in Central Europe]Among the various species of hard ticks, Ixodes ricinus is the most frequently found tick throughout Europe. As with other ixodid ticks, the developmental cycle runs through three stages. In each stage a blood meal is required in order to develop to the next stage. Ixodes ricinus has been found to feed on more than 300 different vertebrate species. Usually, larval ticks feed on small mammals such as mice and become infected with various microorganisms and viruses, of which some are substantial pathogens to humans. The pathogens remain in the tick during molting and are thus transstadially transmitted to the next developmental stage. Pathogens transmitted to humans are the agents of Lyme borreliosis, the tick-borne encephalitis virus, Rickettsia species, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, occasionally Francisella tularensis, and protozoal Babesia species. Within the scope of an EU project Ixodes ricinus ticks from all federal states of Austria were searched by means of PCR methods for bacterial pathogens such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum, <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi sensu lato, Coxiella burnetii, Ehrlichia spp., Francisella tularensis, Rickettsia spp., and protozoal Babesia. Additionally, the prevalence of Bartonella spp. in this tick species was also determined. Besides the singular detection of Coxiella burnetii and Francisella tularensis in one tick collection site the overall prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, borreliae, rickettsae and babesiae in Ixodes ricinus amounted to 15%, 14%, 6% and surprising 36% and 51%, respectively.

19995919,"Ineffectiveness of tigecycline against persistent <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi.The effectiveness of a new first-in-class antibiotic, tigecycline (glycylcycline), was evaluated during the early dissemination (1 week), early immune (3 weeks), or late persistent (4 months) phases of Borrelia burgdorferi infection in C3H mice. Mice were treated with high or low doses of tigecycline, saline (negative-effect controls), or a previously published regimen of ceftriaxone (positive-effect controls). Infection status was assessed at 3 months after treatment by culture, quantitative ospA real-time PCR, and subcutaneous transplantation of joint and heart tissue into SCID mice. Tissues from all saline-treated mice were culture and ospA PCR positive, tissues from all antibiotic-treated mice were culture negative, and some of the tissues from most of the mice treated with antibiotics were ospA PCR positive, although the DNA marker load was markedly decreased compared to that in saline-treated mice. Antibiotic treatment during the early stage of infection appeared to be more effective than treatment that began during later stages of infection. The viability of noncultivable spirochetes in antibiotic-treated mice (demonstrable by PCR) was confirmed by transplantation of tissue allografts from treated mice into SCID mice, with dissemination of spirochetal DNA to multiple recipient tissues, and by xenodiagnosis, including acquisition by ticks, transmission by ticks to SCID mice, and survival through molting into nymphs and then into adults. Furthermore, PCR-positive heart base tissue from antibiotic-treated mice revealed RNA transcription of several B. burgdorferi genes. These results extended previous studies with ceftriaxone, indicating that antibiotic treatment is unable to clear persisting spirochetes, which remain viable and infectious, but are nondividing or slowly dividing.",M1

The Salpl5 protein from both Ixodes scapularis Say and Ixodes ricinus (L.), the principal vectors of the Lyme disease spirochete in eastern North America and Europe, respectively, have been well characterized and found to bind the murine CD4 receptor, DC-SIGN, and the OspC protein of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi. In the current study, we characterized the full salp15 gene in Ixodes pacificus Cooley &amp; Kohls and Ixodes persulcatus Schulze, the principal vectors of Lyme disease spirochetes in western North America and Asia, respectively. In comparing the Salp15 protein of all four principal vector ticks of public health importance for the transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes, we find the 53 C-terminal amino acids to have a high degree of similarity. There are at least three clades in the tree of Salp15 and its homologues, probably representing a multigene family.",M1
19956677,"Evidence that two ATP-dependent (Lon) proteases in <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi serve different functions.The canonical ATP-dependent protease Lon participates in an assortment of biological processes in bacteria, including the catalysis of damaged or senescent proteins and short-lived regulatory proteins. Borrelia spirochetes are unusual in that they code for two putative ATP-dependent Lon homologs, Lon-1 and Lon-2. Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, is transmitted through the blood feeding of Ixodes ticks. Previous work in our laboratory reported that B. burgdorferi lon-1 is upregulated transcriptionally by exposure to blood in vitro, while lon-2 is not. Because blood induction of Lon-1 may be of importance in the regulation of virulence factors critical for spirochete transmission, the clarification of functional roles for these two proteases in B. burgdorferi was the object of this study. On the chromosome, lon-2 is immediately downstream of ATP-dependent proteases clpP and clpX, an arrangement identical to that of lon of Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lon-1 and Lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in the NH(2)-terminal substrate binding domains that may reflect differences in substrate specificity. Recombinant Lon-1 manifested properties of an ATP-dependent chaperone-protease in vitro but did not complement an E. coli Lon mutant, while Lon-2 corrected two characteristic Lon-mutant phenotypes. We conclude that B. burgdorferi Lons -1 and -2 have distinct functional roles. Lon-2 functions in a manner consistent with canonical Lon, engaged in cellular homeostasis. Lon-1, by virtue of its blood induction, and as a unique feature of the Borreliae, may be important in host adaptation from the arthropod to a warm-blooded host.",M1

19950279,"HLA-DR alleles determine responsiveness to <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi antigens in a mouse model of self-perpetuating arthritis.OBJECTIVE: Arthritis is a prominent manifestation of Lyme disease, which is caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb). Chronic Lyme arthritis persisting even after antibiotic treatment is linked to HLA-DRB1*0401 (DR4) and related alleles. In contrast, patients whose Lyme arthritis resolves within 3 months postinfection show an increased frequency of HLA-DRB1*1101 (DR11). The aim of this study was to analyze the underlying mechanism by which HLA-DR alleles confer genetic susceptibility or resistance to antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis. METHODS: We generated DR11-transgenic (DR11-Tg) mice on a murine MHCII-/- background and compared their immune response to Bb antigens with the response of DR4-Tg mice after immunization with Bb outer surface protein A (OspA) or infection with live Bb. RESULTS: T cells from OspA-immunized and Bb-infected DR11-Tg mice had defective production of interferon-gamma as compared with those from DR4-Tg mice. In contrast, DR11-Tg mice developed higher titers of anti-OspA and anti-Bb antibodies, respectively, than did DR4-Tg mice. Consistent with this observation, we found that the Bb-infected DR11-Tg mice had a decreased spirochetal burden as compared with the DR4-Tg mice, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: This study provides direct evidence that in the presence of HLA-DR11, the immune response against Bb antigens is directed toward a protective antibody response. In contrast, an inflammatory Th1 response is induced in the presence of DR4. These observations offer an explanation for the differential genetic susceptibility of DR4+ and DR11+ individuals to the development of chronic Lyme arthritis and, eventually, the progression to antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis.",M1
19920352,"Live imaging reveals a biphasic mode of dissemination of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi within ticks.Lyme disease is caused by transmission of the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi from ticks to humans. Although much is known about B. burgdorferi replication, the routes and mechanisms by which it disseminates within the tick remain unclear. To better understand this process, we imaged live, infectious B. burgdorferi expressing a stably integrated, constitutively expressed GFP reporter. Using isolated tick midguts and salivary glands, we observed B. burgdorferi progress through the feeding tick via what we believe to be a novel, biphasic mode of dissemination. In the first phase, replicating spirochetes, positioned at varying depths throughout the midgut at the onset of feeding, formed networks of nonmotile organisms that advanced toward the basolateral surface of the epithelium while adhering to differentiating, hypertrophying, and detaching epithelial cells. In the second phase of dissemination, the nonmotile spirochetes transitioned into motile organisms that penetrated the basement membrane and entered the hemocoel, then migrated to and entered the salivary glands. We designated the first phase of dissemination  adherence-mediated migration  and provided evidence that it involves the inhibition of spirochete motility by one or more diffusible factors elaborated by the feeding tick midgut. Our studies, which we believe are the first to relate the transmission dynamics of spirochetes to the complex morphological and developmental changes that the midgut and salivary glands undergo during engorgement, challenge the conventional viewpoint that dissemination of Lyme disease-causing spirochetes within ticks is exclusively motility driven.",M1
19917502,"Antibodies against a tick protein, Salp15, protect mice from the Lyme disease agent.Traditionally, vaccines directly target a pathogen or microbial toxin. Lyme disease, caused by <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi, is a tick-borne illness for which a human vaccine is not currently available. B. burgdorferi binds a tick salivary protein, Salp15, during transmission from the vector, and this interaction facilitates infection of mice. We now show that Salp15 antiserum significantly protected mice from B. burgdorferi infection. Salp15 antiserum also markedly enhanced the protective capacity of antibodies against B. burgdorferi antigens, such as OspA or OspC. Mice actively immunized with Salp15 were also significantly protected from tick-borne Borrelia. In vitro assays showed that Salp15 antiserum increased the clearance of Salp15-coated B. burgdorferi by phagocytes, suggesting a mechanism of action. Vaccination with a vector molecule that a microbe requires for infection of the mammalian host suggests a new strategy for the prevention of Lyme disease, and this paradigm may be applicable to numerous arthropod-borne pathogens of medical importance.",M1

B. burgdorferi isolates from the United States induced macrophages to secrete significantly higher levels of interleukin (IL)-8, CCL3, CCL4, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor than B. garinii or B. afzelii isolates. Consistent with this response in cultured macrophages, chemokine and cytokine levels in serum samples of patients from whom the isolates were obtained were significantly greater in B. burgdorferi-infected patients than in B. afzelii- or B. garinii-infected patients. These results demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that B. burgdorferi has greater inflammatory potential than B. afzelii and B. garinii, which may account in part for variations in the clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis.",M1
19906179,"The BosR regulatory protein of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi interfaces with the RpoS regulatory pathway and modulates both the oxidative stress response and pathogenic properties of the Lyme disease spirochete.Summary Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete, adapts as it moves between the arthropod and mammalian hosts that it infects. We hypothesize that BosR serves as a global regulator in B. burgdorferi to modulate the oxidative stress response and adapt to mammalian hosts. To test this hypothesis, a bosR mutant in a low-passage B. burgdorferi isolate was constructed. The resulting bosR::kan(R) strain was altered when grown microaerobically or anaerobically suggesting that BosR is required for optimal replication under both growth conditions. The absence of BosR increased the sensitivity of B. burgdorferi to hydrogen peroxide and reduced the synthesis of Cdr and NapA, proteins important for cellular redox balance and the oxidative stress response, respectively, suggesting an important role for BosR in borrelial oxidative homeostasis. For the bosR mutant, the production of RpoS was abrogated and resulted in the loss of OspC and DbpA, suggesting that BosR interfaces with the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS regulatory cascade. Consistent with the linkage to RpoS, cells lacking bosR were non-infectious in the mouse model of infection. These results indicate that BosR is required for resistance to oxidative stressors and provides a regulatory response that is necessary for B. burgdorferi pathogenesis.",M1

Thus far, a role for BosR in Bb metabolism, gene regulation or pathogenesis has not been determined, largely due to the heretofore inability to inactivate bosR in low-passage, infectious Bb isolates. Herein, we report the generation of the first bosR-deficient mutant in a virulent strain of Bb. Whereas the bosR mutant persisted normally in ticks, the mutant was unable to infect mice, indicating that BosR is essential for Bb infection of a mammalian host. Moreover, transcriptional profiling of the bosR mutant showed that a number of genes were either positively or negatively influenced by BosR deficiency, suggesting that BosR may function both as a global repressor and activator in Bb. Strikingly, our study showed that BosR controls the expression of two major virulence-associated Bb lipoproteins, OspC and DbpA, likely via an influence on the alternative sigma factor, RpoS. This study thus not only has elucidated another key virulence gene of Bb, but also provides new insights into a previously unknown layer of gene regulation governing RpoS in Bb.",M1

Multilocus sequence analysis of five genomic loci from seven samples representing Borrelia sp. nov. isolated from nymphal Ixodes minor collected in South Carolina showed their close relatedness to California strains known as genomospecies 1 and separation from any other known species of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex. One nucleotide difference in the size of the 5S-23S intergenic spacer region, one substitution in 16S rRNA gene signature nucleotides, and silent nucleotide substitutions in sequences of the gene encoding flagellin and the gene p66 clearly separate Borrelia sp. nov. isolates from South Carolina into two subgroups. The sequences of isolates of each subgroup share the same restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns of the 5S-23S intergenic spacer region and contain unique signature nucleotides in the 16S rRNA gene.

19843949,"Cyclooxygenase-1 orchestrates germinal center formation and antibody class-switch via regulation of IL-17.The cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes are known modulators of innate immune cell function; however, their contributions to adaptive immunity are relatively unknown. We investigated the roles of COX-1 and COX-2 in the humoral immune response to infection with the Lyme disease pathogen <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi. We report that in vitro, murine B cells constitutively expressed COX-1 and up-regulated expression of both COX-1 and COX-2 as well as their products PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), and thromboxane B(2) and their receptors following stimulation with B. burgdorferi or anti-CD40. In vitro inhibition of COX-1 and/or COX-2 in murine B cells resulted in decreased eicosanoid production and altered Ab production. Importantly, infection of mice lacking COX-1, but not COX-2, activity resulted in a defect in Ig class-switching and a lack of Borrelia-specific IgG production. This defect correlated with decreased germinal center formation and IL-6 and IL-17 production, and it could be partially recovered by restoration of IL-6, but fully recovered by IL-17. Furthermore, sera from COX-1 inhibitor-treated mice were dramatically less effective in killing B. burgdorferi, but borreliacidal activity was restored in COX-1 inhibitor-treated mice administered IL-17. We conclude that IL-17 plays a role in Ab production and Ig class-switching in response to infection and that COX-1 is a critical, previously unrecognized regulator of this response.",M1
19822652,"Passage through Ixodes scapularis ticks enhances the virulence of a weakly pathogenic isolate of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi.Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in the United States. In this paper we explore the contribution of Ixodes scapularis ticks to the pathogenicity of Borrelia burgdorferi in mice. Previously we demonstrated that an isolate of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (designated N40), passaged 75 times in vitro (N40-75), was infectious but was no longer able to cause arthritis and carditis in C3H mice. We now show that N40-75 spirochetes can readily colonize I. scapularis and multiply during tick engorgement. Remarkably, tick-transmitted N40-75 spirochetes cause disease in mice. N40-75 spirochetes isolated from these animals also retained their pathogenicity when subsequently administered to mice via syringe inoculation. Array analysis revealed that several genes associated with virulence, including bba25, bba65, bba66, bbj09, and bbk32, had higher expression levels in the tick-passaged N40-75 spirochete. These data suggest that transmission of a high-passage attenuated isolate of B. burgdorferi by the arthropod vector results in the generation of spirochetes that have enhanced pathogenesis in mice.",M1

However, B. burgdorferi seropositivity ranges between 6-44% among high risk groups. B. burgdorferi is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks belonging to the genus Ixodes, which may be seen throughout our country. Since the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is attracting attentions to tick bites more than ever in Turkey, the patients with tick bites are followed up more cautiously and have been referred to central hospitals. In this study 4 patients who were referred to our center with prediagnosis of CCHF but later appeared to be Lyme cases, were presented. All of the cases were women, age ranging between 25-67 years old. The patients were from areas where there is high risk of CCHF. CCHF were ruled out in these patients by agent specific polymerase chain reaction and IgM results. All of the patients were clinically diagnosed as Lyme disease since they had lesions compatible with erythema migrans. B. burgdorferi total antibodies investigated by ELISA (Zeus Scientific Inc., USA) were found positive in all patients. Since Western blot method could not be performed, positive serologic results have not be confirmed. However, the diagnosis of Lyme disease was done according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria and all of the cases have recovered following treatment with antibiotics (cefuroxime axetil or sulbactam ampicillin or amoxicillin clavulanic acid). When the increase in the incidence of arthropod-borne infections in our country is considered, it should be noted that tick-bite cases should also be evaluated in terms of Lyme disease besides CCHF.

19794067,"Recognition of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete, by TLR7 and TLR9 induces a type I IFN response by human immune cells.Borrelia burgdorferi is the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, a multisystemic disorder characterized by inflammation. Using global transcriptional profiling, we characterized the response of human PBMCs exposed to B. burgdorferi in an ex vivo coculture system. The expression profiles induced by B. burgdorferi were marked by the intense up-regulation of IFN-responsive transcripts and transcripts involved in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Transcript levels of IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IRF7, and protein concentrations of IFN-alpha, were significantly elevated relative to those in unstimulated PBMCs. The induction of IFN-alpha was completely dependent upon phagocytosis of B. burgdorferi. Addition of a soluble type I IFN receptor, B18R, did not abolish the induction of IFN-inducible genes, indicating that B. burgdorferi directly elicits enhanced expression of these genes independently of type I IFN feedback signaling. Inhibitors of either TLR7 or TLR9 significantly reduced B. burgdorferi-stimulated IFN-alpha protein expression and transcription of IFN-induced genes. Simultaneous inhibition of both TLR7 and TLR9 completely abrogated IFN-alpha induction. The IFN-alpha-producing populations in PBMCs were identified as plasmacytoid dendritic and CD14(+)CD11c(+) cells. These results reveal a TLR7/9-dependent signaling pathway used by human PBMCs to initiate a type I IFN response to the extracellular bacterium B. burgdorferi.",M1

We determined the population structure of B. burgdorferi in over 200 infected nymphs of the primary bridging vector to humans, Ixodes pacificus, collected in Mendocino County, CA. This was accomplished by sequence typing the spirochete lipoprotein ospC and the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (IGS). Thirteen ospC alleles belonging to 12 genotypes were found in California, and the two most abundant, ospC genotypes H3 and E3, have not been detected in ticks in the Northeast. The most prevalent ospC and IGS biallelic profile in the population, found in about 22% of ticks, was a new B. burgdorferi strain defined by ospC genotype H3. Eight of the most common ospC genotypes in the northeastern United States, including genotypes I and K that are associated with disseminated human infections, were absent in Mendocino County nymphs. ospC H3 was associated with hardwood-dominated habitats where western gray squirrels, the reservoir host, are commonly infected with LB spirochetes. The differences in B. burgdorferi population structure in California ticks compared to the Northeast emphasize the need for a greater understanding of the genetic diversity of spirochetes infecting California LB patients.",M1
19780008,"[The dilemma with Lyme borreliosis in the dog with particular consideration of  Lyme nephritis ]Lyme borreliosis is the most commonly reported tick-transmitted infectious disease in the northern hemisphere in humans. Certain diseases are associated with Lyme borreliosis in the dog as well, but only intermittent lameness with articular swelling, lymphadenomegaly, fever, and anorexia were experimentally documented. Lyme borreliosis is considered an over diagnosed disease. The term  Lyme nephritis  was introduced for dogs with characteristic renal lesions and typical clinical signs, in which antibodies against <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi were found. Different studies have been aimed at showing a relation between renal disease and B. burgdorferi infection; however, this was not possible until now. Reasons for the uncertainty of the effects of B. burgdorferi in the dog are the high prevalence of circulating antibodies, the unspecific clinical picture and the inaccuracy of serologic tests.",M1
19776192,"BBK07, a dominant in vivo antigen of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi, is a potential marker for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease.One of the recently identified Borrelia burgdorferi immunogens, BBK07, is characterized for its expression in the spirochete infection cycle and evaluated for its potential use as a serodiagnostic marker for Lyme disease. We show that the BBK07 gene is expressed at extremely low levels in vitro and in ticks but is dramatically induced by spirochetes once introduced into the host and is highly expressed throughout mammalian infection. In contrast, the expression of BBK12, a paralog of BBK07 with 87% amino acid identity, although expressed in vitro, remained undetectable in vivo throughout murine infection and in ticks. BBK07 is localized in the outer membrane, and the amino-terminal domain of the antigen is exposed on the microbial surface. A truncated BBK07 protein representing the amino-terminal domain is able to effectively detect antibodies to B. burgdorferi, both in experimentally infected mice and in humans. Further characterization of the immunodominant antigens of B. burgdorferi, such as BBK07, could contribute to the development of novel serodiagnostic markers for detection of Lyme disease.",M1
19754309,"Toll-like receptors 1 and 2 heterodimers alter <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi gene expression in mice and ticks.Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, is recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 and 2 heterodimers. Microarray analysis of in vivo B. burgdorferi gene expression in murine skin showed that several genes were altered in TLR1/2-deficient animals compared with wild-type mice. For example, expression of bbe21 (a gene involved in B. burgdorferi lp25 plasmid maintenance) and bb0665 (a gene encoding a glycosyl transferase) were higher in TLR1/2-deficient mice than in control animals. In contrast, messenger RNA levels for bb0731 (a spoJ-like gene) and bba74 (a gene encoding a periplasmic protein) were lower in TLR1/2-deficient mice than in wild-type animals. The expression profiles of some of these genes were altered similarly in B. burgdorferi-infected ticks fed on control or TLR1/2-deficient mice. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis supported the microarray analysis and suggested that spirochete gene expression is altered by the milieu created by specific host TLRs, both in the murine host and in the arthropod vector.",M1

An analysis of bb0323 expression in vivo showed variable transcription throughout the spirochete infection cycle, with elevated expression during tick-mouse transmission. Deletion of bb0323 in infectious B. burgdorferi did not affect microbial survival in vitro, despite considerable alterations in growth kinetics and cell morphology. The bb0323 mutants were unable to infect either mice or ticks and were quickly eliminated from immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts and the vector within the first few days after inoculation. Chromosomal complementation of the mutant with native bb0323 and phenotypic analysis in vivo indicated the substantial restoration of spirochete virulence and persistence throughout the mouse-tick infection cycle. The BB0323 protein may serve an indispensable physiological function that is more pronounced during microbial persistence and transitions between the host and the vector in vivo. Strategies to interfere with BB0323 function may interrupt the infectious cycle of spirochetes.",M1

METHOD: Case report presenting a 15-year-old girl referred with hoarseness and soft voice. RESULTS: Right-sided recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis was observed using videolaryngoscopy. Imaging was used to exclude intracranial, cervical and intrathoracic embryological lesions, vascular malformations and tumours. Laboratory and electrophysiological investigations were used to exclude inflammatory and paraneoplastic processes, endocrinopathy and metabolic disorders. Serological testing was positive for Lyme disease. Parenteral ceftriaxone therapy was commenced. The patient's nerve paralysis showed complete recovery on the seventh day of antibiotic treatment; this was confirmed by videolaryngoscopy. CONCLUSION: Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis is an extremely rare complication of neuroborreliosis associated with Lyme disease.

The spatially defined focus, or nidus, of transmission may be characterized by vegetation as well as by climate, latitude, elevation, and geology. The ecological complexity, dimensions, and temporal stability of the nidus are determined largely by pathogen natural history and vector bionomics. Host populations, transmission efficiency, and therefore pathogen amplification vary spatially, thereby creating a heterogeneous surface that may be defined by remote sensing and statistical tools. The current review describes the evolution of landscape epidemiology as a science and exemplifies selected aspects by contrasting the ecology of two different recent disease outbreaks in North America caused by West Nile virus, an explosive, highly virulent mosquito-borne virus producing ephemeral nidi, and <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi, a slowly amplifying chronic pathogen producing semipermanent nidi.",M1

In the United States, the one-step C6 antibody test system based on the invariable domain IR6 of the VlsE molecule has been established as a successful diagnostic tool for testing canine samples. However, only a limited set of data are available regarding the antigenicity of the C6 peptides in an experimental murine model and sensitivity of the test regarding European Borrelia species. In order to investigate antibody reactions induced by these spirochetes, a total of 142 C3H/HeN mice were inoculated with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto N40, B. garinii PBi, two isolates of B. afzelii, B. spielmanii A14S, B. valaisiana Rio6, B. valaisiana VS116, or B. lusitaniae. Infection of the mice was documented utilizing tissue culture and PCR. The IR6 sequences of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto B31, B. garinii IP90, and two B. afzelii ACAI strains have been used to synthesize and test additional C6 peptides. Compared to the well-established two-tiered test system, the results indicate that single C6 peptides derived from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. garinii can be used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based technique to detect murine antibodies induced by either agent. Little is known about the prevalence or pathogenicity of the B. afzelii strains in mammalian hosts, but our experimental data indicate differences in the C6 peptide test sensitivity for the detection of antibodies induced by different strains or isolates of B. afzelii.",M1
19712153,"Risk indicators for the tick Ixodes ricinus and <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi sensu lato in Sweden.The distributional area of the tick Ixodes ricinus (L.), the primary European vector to humans of Lyme borreliosis spirochaetes (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato) and tick-borne encephalitis virus, appears to be increasing in Sweden. It is therefore important to determine which environmental factors are most useful to assess risk of human exposure to this tick and its associated pathogens. The geographical distribution of I. ricinus in Sweden was analysed with respect to vegetation zones and climate. The northern limit of I. ricinus and B. burgdorferi s.l. in Sweden corresponds roughly to the northern limit of the southern boreal vegetation zone, and is characterized climatically by snow cover for a mean duration of 150 days and a vegetation period averaging 170 days. The zoogeographical distribution of I. ricinus in Sweden can be classified as southerly-central, with the centre of the distribution south of the Limes Norrlandicus. Ixodes ricinus nymphs from 13 localities in different parts of Sweden were examined for the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. and found to be infected with Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii. Tick sampling localities were characterized on the basis of the density of Borrelia-infected I. ricinus nymphs, presence of specific mammals, dominant vegetation and climate. Densities of I. ricinus nymphs and Borrelia-infected nymphs were significantly correlated, and nymphal density can thus serve as a general indicator of risk for exposure to Lyme borreliosis spirochaetes. Analysis of data from this and other studies suggests that high densities of Borrelia-infected nymphs typically occur in coastal, broadleaf vegetation and in mixed deciduous/spruce vegetation in southern Sweden. Ixodes ricinus populations consistently infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. can occur in: (a) biotopes with shrews, rodents, hares and birds; (b) biotopes with shrews, rodents, hares, deer and birds, and (c) island locations where the varying hare (Lepus timidus) is the only mammalian tick host.",M1
19706476,"Phylogeography of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi in the eastern United States reflects multiple independent Lyme disease emergence events.Since its first description in coastal Connecticut in 1976, both the incidence of Lyme disease and the geographic extent of endemic areas in the US have increased dramatically. The rapid expansion of Lyme disease into its current distribution in the eastern half of the US has been due to the range expansion of the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis, upon which the causative agent, Borrelia burgdorferi is dependent for transmission to humans. In this study, we examined the phylogeographic population structure of B. burgdorferi throughout the range of I. scapularis-borne Lyme disease using multilocus sequence typing based on bacterial housekeeping genes. We show that B. burgdorferi populations from the Northeast and Midwest are genetically distinct, but phylogenetically related. Our findings provide strong evidence of prehistoric population size expansion and east-to-west radiation of descendent clones from founding sequence types in the Northeast. Estimates of the time scale of divergence of northeastern and midwestern populations suggest that B. burgdorferi was present in these regions of North America many thousands of years before European settlements. We conclude that B. burgdorferi populations have recently reemerged independently out of separate relict foci, where they have persisted since precolonial times.",M1
19703109,"<e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi small lipoprotein Lp6.6 is a member of multiple protein complexes in the outer membrane and facilitates pathogen transmission from ticks to mice.Borrelia burgdorferi lipoprotein Lp6.6 is a differentially produced spirochete antigen. An assessment of lp6.6 expression covering representative stages of the infectious cycle of spirochetes demonstrates that the gene is solely expressed during pathogen persistence in ticks. Deletion of lp6.6 in infectious B. burgdorferi did not influence in vitro growth, or its ability to persist and induce inflammation in mice, migrate to larval or nymphal ticks or survive through the larval-nymphal molt. However, Lp6.6-deficient spirochetes displayed significant impairment in their ability to transmit from infected ticks to naïve mice, which was restored upon genetic complementation of the mutant with a wild-type copy of lp6.6, establishing that Lp6.6 plays a role in pathogen transmission from ticks to mammals. Lp6.6 is a subsurface, yet highly abundant, outer membrane antigen. Two-dimensional blue native/SDS-PAGE coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis and protein cross-linking studies independently shows that Lp6.6 exists in multiple protein complexes in the outer membrane. We speculate that the function of Lp6.6 is connected to the physiological processes of these membrane complexes. Further characterization of differentially produced membrane antigens and associated protein complexes will likely aid in our understanding of the molecular details of B. burgdorferi persistence and transmission through a complex enzootic cycle.",M1
19699380,"Psychiatric comorbidity and other psychological factors in patients with  chronic Lyme disease .BACKGROUND: There is no evidence of current or previous <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi infection in most patients evaluated at university-based Lyme disease referral centers. Instead, psychological factors likely exacerbate the persistent diffuse symptoms or  Chronic Multisymptom Illness  (CMI) incorrectly ascribed to an ongoing chronic infection with B. burgdorferi. The objective of this study was to assess the medical and psychiatric status of such patients and compare these findings to those from patients without CMI. METHODS: There were 240 consecutive patients who underwent medical evaluation and were screened for clinical disorders (eg, depression and anxiety) with diagnoses confirmed by structured clinical interviews at an academic Lyme disease referral center in New Jersey. Personality disorders, catastrophizing, and negative and positive affect also were evaluated, and all factors were compared between groups and with functional outcomes. RESULTS: Of our sample, 60.4% had symptoms that could not be explained by current Lyme disease or another medical condition other than CMI. After adjusting for age and sex, clinical disorders were more common in CMI than in the comparison group (P &lt;.001, odds ratio 3.54, 95% confidence interval, 1.97-6.55), but personality disorders were not significantly more common. CMI patients had higher negative affect, lower positive affect, and a greater tendency to catastrophize pain (P &lt;.001) than did the comparison group. Except for personality disorders, all psychological factors were related to worse functioning. Our explanatory model based on these factors was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric comorbidity and other psychological factors are prominent in the presentation and outcome of some patients who inaccurately ascribe longstanding symptoms to  chronic Lyme disease.

19666713,"GuaA and GuaB are essential for <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi survival in the tick-mouse infection cycle.Pathogens lacking the enzymatic pathways for de novo purine biosynthesis are required to salvage purines and pyrimidines from the host environment for synthesis of DNA and RNA. Two key enzymes in purine salvage pathways are IMP dehydrogenase (GuaB) and GMP synthase (GuaA), encoded by the guaB and guaA genes, respectively. While these genes are typically found on the chromosome in most bacterial pathogens, the guaAB operon of Borrelia burgdorferi is present on plasmid cp26, which also harbors a number of genes critical for B. burgdorferi viability. Using molecular genetics and an experimental model of the tick-mouse infection cycle, we demonstrate that the enzymatic activities encoded by the guaAB operon are essential for B. burgdorferi mouse infectivity and provide a growth advantage to spirochetes in the tick. These data indicate that the GuaA and GuaB proteins are critical for the survival of B. burgdorferi in the infection cycle and highlight a potential difference in the requirements for purine salvage in the disparate mammalian and tick environments.",M1

Cultivation of different Borrelia spp. from 12 erythema migrans biopsies, from 2 blood, one liquor and one placenta sample in BSK-H medium was successful. Adapted conventional methods targeting 16S rRNA and OspA genes for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and partial sequencing of these genes together with microscopical examinations of the blood smears provided a direct detection of the B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi, B. garinii, B. valaisiana and B. bissettii in the skin, B. garinii in the blood, placenta and liquor in 24 (36.3 %) patients, and A. phagocytophilum in 10 (15 %) patients with erythema migrans.

The etiology of the disease is not clear. Some authors postulate its relation with limited scleroderma linearis. Linear scleroderma  en coup de sabre  is characterized by clinical presence of most commonly one-sided linear syndrome. In a number of patients, neurological affection is the medium of the disease.

19620346,"Comparative analysis of the properties and ligand binding characteristics of CspZ, a factor H binding protein, derived from <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi isolates of human origin.Borrelia burgdorferi CspZ (BBH06/BbCRASP-2) binds the complement regulatory protein factor H (FH) and additional unidentified serum proteins. The goals of this study were to assess the ligand binding capability of CspZ orthologs derived from an extensive panel of human Lyme disease isolates and to further define the molecular basis of the interaction between FH and CspZ. While most B. burgdorferi CspZ orthologs analyzed bound FH, specific, naturally occurring polymorphisms, most of which clustered in a specific loop domain of CspZ, prevented FH binding in some orthologs. Sequence analyses also revealed the existence of CspZ phyletic groups that correlate with FH binding and with the relationships inferred from ribosomal spacer types (RSTs). CspZ type 1 (RST1) and type 3 (RST3) strains bind FH, while CspZ type 2 (RST2) strains do not. Antibody responses to CspZ were also assessed. Anti-CspZ antibodies were detected in mice by week 2 of infection, indicating that there was expression during early-stage infection. Analyses of sera collected from infected mice suggested that CspZ production continued over the course of long-term infection as the antibody titer increased over time. While antibody to CspZ was detected in several human Lyme disease serum samples, the response was not universal, and the titers were generally low. Vaccination studies with mice demonstrated that while CspZ is immunogenic, it does not elicit an antibody that is protective or that inhibits dissemination. The data presented here provide significant new insight into the interaction between CspZ and FH and suggest that there is a correlation between CspZ production and dissemination. However, in spite of its possible contributory role in pathogenesis, the immunological analyses indicated that CspZ is likely to have limited potential as a diagnostic marker and vaccine candidate for Lyme disease.",M1

Several recent studies in which Borrelia burgdorferi-infected animals were treated with antibiotic therapy have demonstrated the presence of PCR positivity for B. burgdorferi DNA in the absence of culture positivity. In mice that were treated with antibiotic therapy, residual spirochetes could be taken up by ticks during a blood meal and could be transmitted to SCID mice. These spirochetes are attenuated; their presence is not associated with either inflammation or disease. In this review the methodology and findings of these studies are critically analyzed, and the significance of the results with regard to human Lyme disease is evaluated, with special emphasis on whether these studies provide useful insights into post-Lyme disease syndrome. A serious methodological concern is the failure to consider the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic properties of the antibiotic in choosing the dosage regimen used. We conclude that there is no scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that such spirochetes, should they exist in humans, are the cause of post-Lyme disease syndrome.",M1

Six confirmed inhibitors of ResT, with 50% inhibitory concentrations between 2 and 10 muM, were identified. The inhibitors were characterized further and were grouped into three distinct classes based on their inhibitory features.

The monitoring was based on detecting <e>borrelia</e>'s DNA before- (study I), during- (study II), and after completion of the therapy (study III). In addition, to rule out possible coinfections, the dogs' blood was examined for the presence of anaplasma, babesia and rickettsia. Blood samples taken from 11 dogs, with clinically detected borreliosis, were used for obtaining DNA for PCR. Positive results of PCR, with primers complementary to the fla gene, indicating the presence of DNA of B. burgdorferi s.l., were noted, in study I, in the blood of 7 dogs (63.6% dogs), in study II in 3 dogs, while in study III all blood samples were negative. In 6 out of 7 PCR+, the first study was carried out during week 1. Therefore, the PCR method is useful for monitoring early canine infections with spirochetes B. burgdorferi s.l.

19572471,"Adaptation factors of <e>Borrelia</e> for host and vector.The life transmission cycle of B. burgdorferi requires migration of spirochetes from tick's gut to its salivary glands during vertebrate's blood sucking, penetrating to the vertebrate's tissues and their colonization. A special feature of these bacteria, despite its relatively small genome, is the ability to adapt in different host environments. These unusual properties of borreliae are associated with large number of plasmids, which show a high variability as a result of recombination with each other. Changes in the synthesis of outer proteins are the first strategy of borreliae in avoiding the destructive effect of the host's immune system. Then, by colonizing tissues, they initiate production of Erp and CRASP proteins, which bind regulators and components of complement and repress the cytolytic effect of the host's serum. Some evidences indicate that the spirochetes use quorum sensing as a mechanism to control protein expression. B. burgdorferi probably utilizes a LuxS/autoinducer-2-dependent quorum sensing mechanism. However, it is not yet known how B. burgdorferi detect AI-2. Analysis of the results of expression studies of the luxS gene shows that the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon in B. burgdorferi are only fragmentarily known. Continuation of quorum sensing studies may be essential in improving the construction of vaccines as well as therapy of Lyme disease.",M1
19571749,"Lyme borreliosis: a European perspective on diagnosis and clinical management.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lyme borreliosis has been widely recognized in Europe, but diagnostic and therapy concepts are still a matter for discussion. False-positive microbiologic results can lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment, which even in genuine cases is sometimes unnecessarily prolonged. This review addresses new research on diagnosis, treatment, and eco-epidemiology. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research work in Europe since the last annual review has mostly dealt with diagnostic concepts. Improvement of serology has been achieved by use of multiple recombinant or peptide antigens, or of just the most frequently targeted antigen for detection of specific immunoglobulin G or immunoglobulin M antibodies to <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis. Concerning management of the disease, early work on the efficacy of oral treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis has been confirmed. Studies on the ecology of the vectors and pathogens have elucidated aspects of epidemiology. SUMMARY: Widespread awareness of Lyme borreliosis in Europe continues to grow due to increasing numbers of medical publications, information on the Internet, and from the media and patient support groups. The emphasis in scientific and medical publications has been on improvements in laboratory diagnostics, confirmation of therapeutic protocols, and the ecology of the vectors and pathogens.",M1
19565522,"Analysis of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi genotypes in patients with Lyme arthritis: High frequency of ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer type 1 strains in antibiotic-refractory arthritis.OBJECTIVE: Most of the Borrelia burgdorferi genotypes have been isolated from erythema migrans (EM) skin lesions in patients with Lyme disease. OspC type K strains, which are 16S-23S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer type 2 (RST2) strains, are most commonly recovered, but a higher percentage of OspC type A strains (RST1), the next most commonly recovered type, is detectable in blood. The goal of this study was to determine the B burgdorferi genotypes in the joints of patients with Lyme arthritis. METHODS: Joint fluid samples from 124 patients seen over a 30-year period were analyzed for OspC types by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, and for RSTs by nested PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. These results were correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: OspC and RST genotypes were identified in 49 of the 124 joint fluid samples (40%). In these 49 samples, OspC type K strains (RST2) were identified in 21 samples (43%), OspC type A strains (RST1) were identified in 11 samples (22%), and 8 other OspC types and all 3 RSTs were identified among the remaining 17 samples (35%). However, among the 17 patients who had been treated with antibiotics according to current guidelines, all 7 patients who were infected with RST1 strains had antibiotic-refractory arthritis, compared with 4 of 6 patients infected with RST2 strains and only 1 of 4 infected with RST3 strains (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Most of the B burgdorferi genotypes, particularly OspC type K (RST2), were identified in the joint fluid of patients with Lyme arthritis, and the genotype frequencies found in joints reflected those in EM skin lesions. However, RST1 strains were most frequent in patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis. Our results help to further the understanding of the differential pathogenicity of strains of B burgdorferi.",M1
19562015,"Lyme disease--current state of knowledge.BACKGROUND: Lyme disease is the most frequent tick-borne infectious disease in Europe. The discovery of the causative pathogen <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi in 1982 opened the way for the firm diagnosis of diseases in several clinical disciplines and for causal antibiotic therapy. At the same time, speculation regarding links between Borrelia infection and a variety of nonspecific symptoms and disorders resulted in overdiagnosis and overtreatment of suspected Lyme disease. METHOD: The authors conducted a selective review of the literature, including various national and international guidelines. RESULTS: The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is present in approximately 5% to 35% of sheep ticks (Ixodes ricinus) in Germany, depending on the region. In contrast to North America, different genospecies are found in Europe. The most frequent clinical manifestation of Borrelia infection is erythema migrans, followed by neuroborreliosis, arthritis, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, and lymphocytosis benigna cutis. Diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical symptoms, and in stages II and III by detection of Borrelia-specific antibodies. In adults erythema migrans is treated with doxycycline, in children with amoxicillin. The standard treatment of neuroborreliosis is third-generation cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: After appropriate antibiotic therapy, the outcome is favorable. In approximately 95% of cases neuroborreliosis is cured without long-term sequelae. When chronic borreliosis is suspected, other potential causes of the clinical syndrome must be painstakingly excluded.",M1

19514824,"Implications of gender in chronic Lyme disease.BACKGROUND:  Post-Lyme disease syndrome  refers to prolonged subjective symptoms after antibiotic treatment and resolution of an objective manifestation of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi infection (Lyme disease).  Chronic Lyme disease  is a vaguely defined term that has been applied to patients with unexplained prolonged subjective symptoms, whether or not there was or is evidence of B. burgdorferi infection. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the population of patients with chronic Lyme disease differs from the populations of patients with either Lyme disease or post-Lyme disease syndrome by examining the gender of patients with these diagnoses. Methods: Data on gender were compiled in this cross-sectional study based on a systematic review of published studies of antibiotic treatment in United States patients with post-Lyme disease syndrome (n = 184) or chronic Lyme disease (n = 490), and on cases of adults with Lyme disease reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2003 to 2005 (n = 43,282). RESULTS: Patients with chronic Lyme disease were significantly more likely to be female than were patients diagnosed with either Lyme disease (odds ratio [OR] 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.98-2.94, p &lt; 0.0001) or with post-Lyme disease syndrome (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.62-3.34, p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic Lyme disease differ with regard to gender from those with either B. burgdorferi infection or post-Lyme disease syndrome. This finding suggests that illnesses with a female preponderance, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or depression, may be misdiagnosed as chronic Lyme disease.",M1
19513109,"Complex population structure of Lyme borreliosis group spirochete <e>Borrelia</e> garinii in subarctic Eurasia.Borrelia garinii, a causative agent of Lyme borreliosis in Europe and Asia, is naturally maintained in marine and terrestrial enzootic cycles, which primarily involve birds, including seabirds and migratory passerines. These bird groups associate with, correspondingly, Ixodes uriae and Ixodes ricinus ticks, of which the latter species may bite and transmit the infection to humans. Studies of the overlap between these two natural cycles of B. garinii have been limited, in part due to the absence of representative collections of this spirochete's samples, as well as of the lack of reliable measure of the genetic heterogeneity of its strains. As a prerequisite for understanding the epidemiological correlates of the complex maintenance of B. garinii, the present study sought to assess the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of this species' strains from its natural hosts and patients with Lyme borreliosis from subarctic Eurasia. We used sequence typing of the partial rrs-rrl intergenic spacer (IGS) of archived and prospective samples of B. garinii from I. uriae ticks collected predominantly on Commander Islands in North Pacific, as well as on the islands in northern Sweden and arctic Norway. We also typed B. garinii samples from patients with Lyme borreliosis and I. ricinus ticks infesting migratory birds in southern Sweden, or found questing in selected sites on the islands in the Baltic Sea and Lithuania. Fifty-two (68%) of 77 B. garinii samples representing wide geographical range and associated with I. ricinus and infection of humans contributed 12 (60%) of total 20 identified IGS variants. In contrast, the remaining 25 (32%) samples recovered from I. uriae ticks from a few islands accounted for as many as 10 (50%) IGS types, suggesting greater local diversity of B. garinii maintained by seabirds and their ticks. Two IGS variants of the spirochete in common for both tick species were found in I. ricinus larvae from migratory birds, an indication that B. garinii strains are exchanged between different ecological niches. Notably, B. garinii variants associated with I. uriae ticks were found in each of the six clusters, representing two phylogenetic lineages of this species identified among the studied samples. Our findings suggest that B. garinii in subarctic Eurasia comprises two partially overlapping populations with different levels of genetic heterogeneity, presumably, due to distinctive selective pressures on the spirochete in its marine and terrestrial enzootic cycles.",M1

19505540,"Fast, adaptive evolution at a bacterial host-resistance locus: the PFam54 gene array in <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi.Microbial pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for evasion of host innate and adaptive immunities. PFam54 is the largest paralogous gene family in the genomes of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease bacterium. One member of PFam54, the complement-regulator acquiring surface proteins 1 (BbCrasp-1), is able to abort the alternative pathway of complement activation via binding human complement-regulator factor H (FH). The gene coding for BbCRASP-1 exists in a tandem array of PFam54 genes in the B. burgdorferi genome, a result apparently of repeated gene duplications. To help elucidate the functions of the large number of PFam54 genes, we performed phylogenomic and structural analyses of the PFam54 gene array from ten B. burgdorferi genomes. Analyses based on gene tree, genome synteny, and structural models revealed rapid adaptive evolution of this array through gene duplication, gene loss, and functional diversification. Individual PFam54 genes, however, do not show high intra-population sequence polymorphisms as genes providing evasion from adaptive immunity generally do. PFam54 members able to bind human FH are not monophyletic, suggesting that human FH affinity, however strong, is an incidental rather than main function of these PFam54 proteins. The large number of PFam54 genes existing in any single B. burgdorferi genome may target different innate-immunity proteins of a single host species or the same immune protein of a variety of host species. Genetic variability of the PFam54 gene array suggests that universally present PFam54 lineages such as BBA64, BBA65, BBA66, and BBA73 may be better candidates for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines or drugs than strain-restricted lineages such as BbCRASP-1.",M1

Among the seropositive samples, the PCR for B. burgdorferi confirmed the positivity in 65 percent of the forestry workers and in 60 percent of the subjects living in the same area.

19496415,"Assortative pairing in Ixodes ricinus (Acari: Ixodidae), the European vector of Lyme borreliosis.In sexual organisms, the way in which gametes associate can greatly influence the maintenance of genetic variation, the structure of this variation in space, and ultimately organismal evolution. Based on patterns of genetic structure previously found, we explicitly tested whether adults of the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus pair according to their genetic relatedness. We sampled tick pairs from the vegetation in four natural populations and genotyped individual ticks at seven microsatellite loci. Based on this data, we observed highly significant assortative mating in two of the four locations, a pattern that could not be accounted for by a spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of related ticks. One explanation for these observations may be the existence of local host associations that develop independently in different populations. Assortative mating in I. ricinus will have clear consequences for its population dynamics and, through processes of adaptation and transmission, may significantly alter the epidemiological patterns of the pathogens it carries, including the Lyme disease agent <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi s.l.

19487688,"Lipidomic analysis of dynamic eicosanoid responses during the induction and resolution of Lyme arthritis.Eicosanoids and other bioactive lipid mediators are indispensable regulators of biological processes, as demonstrated by the numerous inflammatory diseases resulting from their dysregulation, including cancer, hyperalgesia, atherosclerosis, and arthritis. Despite their importance, a robust strategy comparable with gene or protein array technology for comprehensively analyzing the eicosanoid metabolome has not been forthcoming. We have developed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methodology that quantitatively and comprehensively analyzes the eicosanoid metabolome and utilized this approach to characterize eicosanoid production during experimental Lyme arthritis in mice infected with the bacterium <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi. Eicosanoids were extracted throughout infection from the joints of Lyme arthritis-resistant and -susceptible mice and subjected to lipidomic profiling. We identified temporal and quantitative differences between these mouse strains in the production of eicosanoids, which correlated with differences in arthritis development. The eicosanoid biosynthetic enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 has been implicated in the regulation of Lyme arthritis pathology, and subsequent lipidomic profiling of B. burgdorferi-infected COX-2(-/-) mice identified reductions not only in COX-2 products but, surprisingly, also significant off-target reductions in 5-lipoxygenase metabolites. Our results demonstrate the utility of a comprehensive lipidomic approach for identifying potential contributors to disease pathology and may facilitate the development of more precisely targeted treatment strategies.",M1
19487481,"The caspase 1 inflammasome is not required for control of murine Lyme borreliosis.The contribution of the inflammasome to the development of immune responses and disease during infection with the Lyme disease spirochete, <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi, is not well defined. Host defense against the spirochete is severely impaired in mice deficient in the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation antigen 88 (MyD88), which is required not only for Toll-like receptor-mediated responses but also for the production of the proforms of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-18. These cytokines are released in active forms after cleavage by the inflammasome-associated enzyme caspase 1. To investigate the contribution of the inflammasome to host defense against B. burgdorferi, we examined Lyme borreliosis in mice deficient in either caspase 1 or apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC), a molecule upstream of caspase 1 in the inflammasome signaling cascade. We found that caspase 1-deficient mice had a mild transient elevation in pathogen burden and a trend toward an increase in the prevalence of arthritis early in infection, but these differences resolved by day 14 postinfection. Caspase 1 deficiency had no effect on B. burgdorferi-induced humoral immunity, T-cell responses, or the abilities of macrophages to ingest and degrade spirochetes. The absence of the ASC protein had no effect on the control of the spirochete or the development of immune responses and disease. These findings reveal that the caspase 1 inflammasome is not critical to host defense against the extracellular pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi.",M1
19487472,"Interval-specific congenic lines reveal quantitative trait Loci with penetrant lyme arthritis phenotypes on chromosomes 5, 11, and 12.The observation that <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi-induced arthritis is severe in C3H mice and milder in C57BL/6 (B6) mice has allowed a forward genetics approach for the identification of genetic elements that regulate the arthritis response. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) on five chromosomes (Chr) were identified previously in segregating crosses between C3H and B6 mice and collectively designated B. burgdorferi arthritis-associated (Bbaa) QTL. Reciprocal interval-specific congenic lines (ISCL) that encompass Bbaa1, Bbaa2-Bbaa3, Bbaa4, Bbaa6, and Bbaa12 on Chr 4, 5, 11, 12, and 1, respectively, have now been generated. Bidirectional transfer of the arthritis severity phenotype in association with Bbaa2-Bbaa3 and Bbaa4 was observed, and unidirectional transfer with the B6 allele of Bbaa6 was noted. These findings confirm the existence of polymorphic loci within Bbaa2-Bbaa3, Bbaa4, and Bbaa6 that regulate the severity of B. burgdorferi-induced arthritis. ISCL were used to assess the regulation of a previously identified interferon transcriptional profile associated with severe disease in C3H mice. The regulation of this transcriptional signature was found to be independent of penetrant Bbaa QTL, both in joint tissues and in isolated macrophages. These results clearly demonstrate the utility of forward genetics for the discovery of novel genes and pathways involved in the regulation of the severity of Lyme arthritis and predict the involvement of regulatory elements not evident from other experimental approaches.",M1
19461880,"The urokinase receptor (uPAR) facilitates clearance of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi.The causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, has been shown to induce expression of the urokinase receptor (uPAR); however, the role of uPAR in the immune response against Borrelia has never been investigated. uPAR not only acts as a proteinase receptor, but can also, dependently or independently of ligation to uPA, directly affect leukocyte function. We here demonstrate that uPAR is upregulated on murine and human leukocytes upon exposure to B. burgdorferi both in vitro as well as in vivo. Notably, B. burgdorferi-inoculated C57BL/6 uPAR knock-out mice harbored significantly higher Borrelia numbers compared to WT controls. This was associated with impaired phagocytotic capacity of B. burgdorferi by uPAR knock-out leukocytes in vitro. B. burgdorferi numbers in vivo, and phagocytotic capacity in vitro, were unaltered in uPA, tPA (low fibrinolytic activity) and PAI-1 (high fibrinolytic activity) knock-out mice compared to WT controls. Strikingly, in uPAR knock-out mice partially backcrossed to a B. burgdorferi susceptible C3H/HeN background, higher B. burgdorferi numbers were associated with more severe carditis and increased local TLR2 and IL-1beta mRNA expression. In conclusion, in B. burgdorferi infection, uPAR is required for phagocytosis and adequate eradication of the spirochete from the heart by a mechanism that is independent of binding of uPAR to uPA or its role in the fibrinolytic system.",M1
19447458,"[Epidemiology of Lyme borreliosis and neuroborreliosis in France]Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a systemic disease called neuroborreliosis (NB) when neurological symptoms are pre-eminent. LB is a zoonosis caused by <e>Borrelia</e> bacteria transmitted by Ixodes tick-bite. Because of the absence of a national registry, epidemiology of LB in France is not well known. Moreover, diagnosis of NB may be difficult because of the various clinical forms. Acute meningoradiculitis is the most common presentation, but pauci-symptomatic meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, polyneuropathy, cerebrovascular involvement, and rarely chronic encephalomyelitis are also described. The vector Ixodes ricinus (I. ricinus) is found throughout metropolitan France excepting border areas of the Mediterranean seaside and in regions with an altitude above 1500 meters. In France, the Borrelia infestation rate of Ixodes is 7% with wide disparity between administrative districts. Prospective work in 1999-2000 by 875 general practitioners participating in the  Sentinel  network established the estimated incidence of BL (9.4/100 000) and of NB (0.6/100 000) in France. Incidence is higher in certain regions: in Alsace, prospective work by 419 general practitioners and specialists in cooperation with the national surveillance agency (Institut national de veille sanitaire), estimated BL incidence at 86 to 200/100 000 inhabitants and NB at 10/100 000. Thus, although globally France is a country with a moderate risk for LB, some regions such as Limousin, Auvergne, Lorraine and Alsace, have a high risk of LB, comparable to countries in the northeastern Europe such as Germany and Sweden.",M1
19426490,"Follow-up of Bernese Mountain dogs and other dogs with serologically diagnosed <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi infection: what happens to seropositive animals?BACKGROUND: Data on the long-term outcome of B. burgdorferi infections in adult dogs are sparse. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether Bernese Mountain dogs with serological evidence of natural B. burgdorferi infection more often develop signs such as lameness, azotemia or proteinuria during a follow-up period of 2.5 to 3.0 years. Seropositive Bernese Mountain dogs were compared to seronegative Bernese Mountain dogs and to seropositive and seronegative control dogs of other breeds. Dogs included in a previous study on the prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi in Bernese Mountain dogs were re-evaluated. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi were determined using an ELISA with a whole-cell sonicate as antigen and results were confirmed using a Western blot assay. RESULTS: Fifty-three Bernese Mountain dogs and 30 control dogs were re-evaluated. Re-evaluation was performed between 2.5 and 3.0 years (median 2.7 years) after the first assessment.The age of the dogs at the second evaluation ranged from 3 to 11 years (median 6 years). There were no significant differences with regard to poor general condition or lameness between the first and the second evaluation. At the first evaluation 22 (42%) of the Bernese Mountain dogs and 11 (37%) of the control dogs were considered positive for antibodies against B. burgdorferi. At the second evaluation 25 (47%) of the Bernese Mountain dogs and 12 (40%) of the control dogs were considered positive; 69% of the dogs showed the same serological result at both examinations and 31% were seroconverted or seroreverted. During the first examination, azotemia was diagnosed in 6 Bernese Mountain dogs and during the second examination in 11 Bernese Mountain dogs. No control dogs had azotemia in this study. In seropositive dogs there was no increase in lameness or signs of renal disease over time. CONCLUSION: It may be concluded that antibodies against B. burgdorferi determined by whole cell ELISA and confirmed by Western blot were neither associated with the development of lameness nor with signs of renal disease like azotemia or proteinuria in dogs observed over a period of 2.5 to 3.0 years.",M1
19422467,"Cerebrospinal fluid PCR and antibody concentrations against Anaplasma phagocytophilum and <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi sensu lato in dogs with neurological signs.BACKGROUND: The tick-borne bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum have been suspected to cause neurological signs in dogs. Diagnosis often has been made based on positive antibody titers in serum of dogs with neurological signs, but a high seroprevalence in dogs in at-risk populations makes diagnosis difficult. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the neurological signs in dogs examined were caused by any of these bacteria. ANIMALS: Fifty-four dogs presented to a board-certified neurologist. METHODS: Prospective study. We divided dogs into 2 groups: those with inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) and those with neurological signs from other diseases. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from all dogs were analyzed. RESULTS: Dogs with inflammatory CNS diseases showed no serum antibodies against any of the agents. Among dogs with neurological signs from other diseases, 10.3% had serum antibodies for B. burgdorferi sl and 20.5% for A. phagocytophilum. All blood samples analyzed for bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and all CSF analyzed for antibodies and bacterial DNA for the 2 agents were negative. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Based on this study, these bacteria are unlikely causes of neurologic disease in dogs and the presence of serum antibodies alone does not document or establish a definitive diagnosis of CNS disease caused by these organisms. Dogs that have neurologic disease and corresponding serum antibodies against these agents should have additional tests performed to assess for other potential etiologies of the signs.",M1

OBJECTIVES: As the pathogenesis of Lyme borreliosis is not fully understood, the study has been designed to examine levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) in serum and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Lyme borreliosis and their associations with clinical signs and symptoms and anti-Borrelia burgdorferi (anti-Bb) antibody titers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled in the study, including 39 patients treated for Lyme borreliosis and 25 without the disease (control group). In both groups sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 levels were determined in serum and the CSF. RESULTS: Mean serum sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 levels were higher in patients with Lyme borreliosis than in the control group. Serum sICAM-1 levels were significantly lower among patients with results positive for immunoglobulin M seroreactivity with Bb than among those with negative antibody responses. In patients with Bb-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, significantly higher serum sICAM-1 levels were found. Higher sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 levels in the CSF were observed in patients positive for anti-Bb IgG antibody titers in the CSF. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Lyme borreliosis, endothelial cell activation results in elevated levels of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 in serum and the CSF.",M1
19404402,"A novel fibronectin binding motif in MSCRAMMs targets F3 modules.BACKGROUND: BBK32 is a surface expressed lipoprotein and fibronectin (Fn)-binding microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecule (MSCRAMM) of <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Previous studies from our group showed that BBK32 is a virulence factor in experimental Lyme disease and located the Fn-binding region to residues 21-205 of the lipoprotein. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Studies aimed at identifying interacting sites between BBK32 and Fn revealed an interaction between the MSCRAMM and the Fn F3 modules. Further analysis of this interaction showed that BBK32 can cause the aggregation of human plasma Fn in a similar concentration-dependent manner to that of anastellin, the superfibronectin (sFn) inducing agent. The resulting Fn aggregates are conformationally distinct from plasma Fn as indicated by a change in available thermolysin cleavage sites. Recombinant BBK32 and anastellin affect the structure of Fn matrices formed by cultured fibroblasts and inhibit endothelial cell proliferation similarly. Within BBK32, we have located the sFn-forming activity to a region between residues 160 and 175 which contains two sequence motifs that are also found in anastellin. Synthetic peptides mimicking these motifs induce Fn aggregation, whereas a peptide with a scrambled sequence motif was inactive, suggesting that these motifs represent the sFn-inducing sequence. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that BBK32 induces the formation of Fn aggregates that are indistinguishable from those formed by anastellin. The results of this study provide evidence for how bacteria can target host proteins to manipulate host cell activities.",M1
20231403,"Molecular characterization of the interaction of <e>Borrelia</e> parkeri and Borrelia turicatae with human complement regulators.In North America, tick-borne relapsing fever is caused by the species Borrelia hermsii, B. parkeri, and B. turicatae, which are transmitted to humans through the bite of the respective infected tick vectors. Here we describe the identification and functional characterization of a surface lipoprotein of B. parkeri, designated BpcA, that binds the human complement regulators factor H and factor H-related protein 1 and, simultaneously, the host protease plasminogen. In contrast, the homologous B. turicatae protein failed to bind human factor H and factor H-related protein 1 but retained its plasminogen binding capacity. Factor H bound to BpcA maintains its regulatory capacity to control C3b deposition and C3 convertase activity. Ectopic expression of BpcA in a serum-sensitive B. burgdorferi strain protects transformed cells from complement-mediated killing. Furthermore, bound plasminogen/plasmin endows B. parkeri and B. turicatae with the potential to degrade extracellular matrix components. These findings expand our understanding of the putative recent evolutionary separation of Borrelia parkeri and Borrelia turicatae, provide evidence that B. parkeri differs from B. turicatae in its ability to resist complement attack, and may help in understanding the pathological processes underlying tick-borne relapsing fever.",M2

We observed a 21-fold increase in spirochete titers, whereas the numbers of parasitized erythrocytes were reduced 15-fold. This may be explained by polarization of the host immune response toward the intracellular malaria parasite, resulting in unaffected extracellular spirochetes and hosts that succumb to sepsis. Mixed infection also resulted in severe malaria anemia with low hemoglobin levels, even though the parasite counts were low. Overall, coinfected animals had a higher fatality rate and shorter time to death than those with either malaria or RF single infection. Furthermore, secondary malaria infection reactivated a quiescent RF brain infection, which is the first evidence of a clinically and biologically relevant cue for reactivation of RF Borrelia infection. Our study highlights the importance of investigating concomitant infections in vivo to elucidate the immune responses that are involved in the clinical outcome.",M2
20080535,"Lipid binding orientation within CD1d affects recognition of <e>Borrelia</e> burgorferi antigens by NKT cells.Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) respond to CD1d-presented glycolipids from Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Although mouse and human iNKT cells respond to different antigens based on subtle differences in their fatty acids, the mechanism by which fatty acid structure determines antigenic potency is not well understood. Here we show that the mouse and human CD1d present glycolipids having different fatty acids, based in part upon a difference at a single amino acid position that is involved in positioning the sugar epitope. CD1d also can bind nonantigenic lipids, however, but unexpectedly, mouse CD1d orients the two aliphatic chains of a nonantigenic lipid rotated 180 degrees, causing a dramatic repositioning of the exposed sugar. Therefore, our data reveal the biochemical basis for the high degree of antigenic specificity of iNKT cells for certain fatty acids, and they suggest how microbes could alter fatty acid biosynthesis as an immune evasion mechanism.",M2

We used species-specific, quantitative polymerase chain reaction to study both species in the blood and skin of Peromyscus leucopus mice and host-seeking Ixodes scapularis nymphs at a Connecticut site. Bacteremias with B. burgdorferi or B. miyamotoi were most prevalent during periods of greatest activity for nymphs or larvae, respectively. Whereas B. burgdorferi was 30-fold more frequent than B. miyamotoi in skin biopsies and mice had higher densities of B. burgdorferi densities in the skin than in the blood, B. miyamotoi densities were higher in blood than skin. In a survey of host-seeking nymphs in 11 northern states, infection prevalences for B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi averaged approximately 0.20 and approximately 0.02, respectively. Co-infections of P. leucopus or I. scapularis with both B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi were neither more nor less common than random expectations.",M2

Genetic markers of Powassan virus, Bartonella spp., and Balbesia spp. were not found. Analysis of the genetic diversity of revealed pathogens resulted in the following conclusions: 1. TBEV strains belong to Siberian and Far-Eastern subtypes, and Far-Eastern subtype of TBEV is most frequent in urban biotypes (up to 43 % of urban strains of TBEV); 2. WNV strains belong to genotype la; 3. Borrelia spp. were classified as B. garinii; 4. Rickettsia spp. were classified as R. tarasevichiae and probably as a new Rickettsia raoultii subspecies; 5.

19936201,"Stem loop sequences specific to transposable element IS605 are found linked to lipoprotein genes in <e>Borrelia</e> plasmids.BACKGROUND: Plasmids of Borrelia species are dynamic structures that contain a large number of repetitive genes, gene fragments, and gene fusions. In addition, the transposable element IS605/200 family, as well as degenerate forms of this IS element, are prevalent. In Helicobacter pylori, flanking regions of the IS605 transposase gene contain sequences that fold into identical small stem loops. These function in transposition at the single-stranded DNA level. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In work reported here, bioinformatics techniques were used to scan Borrelia plasmid genomes for IS605 transposable element specific stem loop sequences. Two variant stem loop motifs are found in the left and right flanking regions of the transposase gene. Both motifs appear to have dispersed in plasmid genomes and are found  free-standing  and phylogenetically conserved without the associated IS605 transposase gene or the adjacent flanking sequence. Importantly, IS605 specific stem loop sequences are also found at the 3' ends of lipoprotein genes (PFam12 and PFam60), however the left and right sequences appear to develop their own evolutionary patterns. The lipoprotein gene-linked left stem loop sequences maintain the IS605 stem loop motif in orthologs but only at the RNA level. These show mutations whereby variants fold into phylogenetically conserved RNA-type stem loops that contain the wobble non-Watson-Crick G-U base-pairing. The right flanking sequence is associated with the family lipoprotein-1 genes. A comparison of homologs shows that the IS605 stem loop motif rapidly dissipates, but a more elaborate secondary structure appears to develop in its place. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Stem loop sequences specific to the transposable element IS605 are present in plasmid regions devoid of a transposase gene and significantly, are found linked to lipoprotein genes in Borrelia plasmids. These sequences are evolutionarily conserved and/or structurally developed in an RNA format. The findings show that IS605 stem loop sequences are multifaceted and are selectively conserved during evolution when the transposable element dissipates.",M2
19888463,"Structure-function investigation of vsp serotypes of the spirochete <e>Borrelia</e> hermsii.BACKGROUND: Relapsing fever (RF) spirochetes are notable for multiphasic antigenic variation of polymorphic outer membrane lipoproteins, a phenomenon responsible for immune evasion. An additional role in tissue localization is suggested by the finding that isogenic serotypes 1 (Bt1) and 2 (Bt2) of the RF spirochete Borrelia turicatae, which differ only in the Vsp they express, exhibit marked differences in clinical disease severity and tissue localization during infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we used known vsp DNA sequences encoding for B. turicatae and Borrelia hermsii Vsp proteins with variable regions and then studied whether there are differences in disease expression and tissue localization of their corresponding serotypes during mouse infection. For sequence and structural comparisons we focused exclusively on amino acid residues predicted to project away from the spirochetes surface, referred to as the Vsp dome. Disease severity and tissue localization were studied during persistent infection with individual or mixed serotypes in SCID mice. The results showed that all Vsp domes clustered into 3 main trunks, with the domes for B. turicatae Vsp1 (BtVsp1) and BtVsp2 clustering into separate ones. B. hermsii serotypes whose Vsp domes clustered with the BtVsp1 dome were less virulent but localized to the brain more. The BtVsp2 dome was the oddball among all and Bt2 was the only serotype that caused severe arthritis. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that there is significant variability in Vsp dome structure, disease severity, and tissue localization among serotypes of B. hermsii.",M2
19884498,"Relapsing fever <e>Borrelia</e> binds to neolacto glycans and mediates rosetting of human erythrocytes.A hallmark of acute relapsing fever borreliosis is severe bacteremia. Some Borrelia species, such as B. duttonii and B. crocidurae, associate with erythrocytes and induce aggregation recognized as erythrocyte rosetting. Erythrocyte rosettes contribute to disease severity by increased tissue invasiveness (such as invasion of CNS and encephalitis), hemorrhaging, and reduced blood flow in affected microcapillaries. Here we report that relapsing fever Borrelia binds to neolacto (Galbeta4GlcNAcbeta3Galbeta4Glcbeta1)-carrying glycoconjugates that are present on human erythrocytes. This interaction is of low affinity but is compensated for by the multivalency of neo-lacto-oligosaccharides on the erythrocyte cell surface. Hence, the protein-carbohydrate interaction is dependent on multivalent neolacto-glycans to mediate binding.",M2

Borrelia lonestari, which has been suggested as a possible causative agent of southern tick-associated rash illness, naturally infects white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) and is transmitted by the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum). To better understand the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia exposure among WTD, we tested WTD from 21 eastern states for antibodies reactive to B. lonestari using an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay and Borrelia burgdorferi using the IDEXX SNAP 4Dx test. A total of 107/714 (15%) had antibodies reactive to B. lonestari, and prevalence of antibodies was higher in deer from southern states (17.5%) than in deer from northern states (9.2%). Using the SNAP 4DX test, we found that 73/723 (10%) were positive for B. burgdorferi, and significantly more northern deer (23.9%) were positive compared with southern deer (3.8%). Our data demonstrate that WTD are exposed to both Borrelia species, but antibody prevalence for exposure to the two species differs regionally and distributions correlate with the presence of Ixodes scapularis and A. americanum ticks.",M2

19858303,"Functional characterization of <e>Borrelia</e> spielmanii outer surface proteins that interact with distinct members of the human factor H protein family and with plasminogen.Acquisition of complement regulator factor H (CFH) and factor H-like protein 1 (CFHL1) from human serum enables Borrelia spielmanii, one of the etiological agents of Lyme disease, to evade complement-mediated killing by the human host. Up to three distinct complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs) may be expressed by serum-resistant B. spielmanii, each exhibiting an affinity for CFH and/or CFHL1. Here, we describe the functional characterization of the 15-kDa CRASPs of B. spielmanii, members of the polymorphic Erp (OspE/F-related) protein family, that bind two distinct host complement regulators, CFH and factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1), but not CFHL1. CFH bound to the B. spielmanii CRASPs maintained cofactor activity for factor I-mediated C3b inactivation. Three naturally occurring alleles of this protein bound CFH and CFHR1 while a fourth natural allele could not. Comparative sequence analysis of these protein alleles identified a single amino acid, histidine-79, as playing a significant role in CFH/CFHR1 binding, with substitution by an arginine completely abrogating ligand binding. The mutation of His-79 to Arg did not inhibit binding of plasminogen, another known ligand of this group of borrelial outer-surface proteins.",M2
19758349,"Isolation and characterization of a novel <e>Borrelia</e> group of tick-borne borreliae from imported reptiles and their associated ticks.The members of the genus Borrelia are transmitted by arthropods and known to be infectious to vertebrates. Here we found isolates and DNAs belonging to the Borrelia turcica and unknown Borrelia species from imported reptiles and their ectoparasites. The Borrelia strains were isolated from blood and multiple organs of exotic tortoises, and were experimentally infectious to captive-bred tortoises. These findings suggest that these tortoises may be a candidate as the reservoir host of the Borrelia species. In this study, the Borrelia strains were also isolated from and/or detected in hard-bodied ticks, Amblyomma ticks and Hyalomma ticks. In some of these ticks, immunofluorescence imaging analysis revealed that the Borrelia had also invaded into the tick salivary glands. Accordingly, these ticks were expected to be a potential vector of the Borrelia species. Sequencing analyses of both housekeeping genes (flaB gene, gyrB gene and 16S rDNA gene) and 23S rRNA gene-16S rRNA gene intergenic spacer region revealed that these Borrelia strains formed a monophyletic group that was independent from two other Borrelia groups, Lyme disease Borrelia and relapsing fever Borrelia. From these results, the novel group of Borrelia comprises the third major group of arthropod-transmitted borreliae identified to date.",M2
19699799,"Distinct in situ structures of the <e>Borrelia</e> flagellar motor.Bacteria can be propelled in liquids by flagellar filaments that are attached to and moved by flagellar motors. These motors are rotary nanomachines that use the electrochemical potential from ion gradients. The motor can spin in both directions with specific proteins regulating the direction in response to chemotactic stimuli. Here we investigated the structure of flagellar motors of Borrelia spirochetes, the causative agents of Lyme disease in humans. We revealed the structure of the motor complex at 4.6-nm resolution by sub-volume averaging of cryo-electron tomograms and subsequently imposing rotational symmetry. This allowed direct visualisation of individual motor components, the connection between the stator and the peptidoglycan as well as filamentous linkers between the stator and the rod. Two different motor assemblies seem to co-exist at a single bacterial pole. While most motors were completely assembled, a smaller fraction appeared to lack part of the C-ring, which plays a role in protein export and switching the directionality of rotation. Our data suggest a novel mechanism that bacteria may use to control the direction of movement.",M2

The first group was exposed to ticks infected with B. anserina, the second group was exposed to noninfected ticks, and the third group was not exposed to ticks. Blood smears from each bird of groups 1 and 2 were prepared daily and examined for 25 days postexposure (PE). Examination of the blood smears from birds in group 1 revealed large numbers of spirochetes from days 5 to 12 PE. In this group the prepatent and patent periods were 5-7 and 4-7 days, respectively. Birds from group 1 presented ruffled feathers, pale combs, drowsiness, inappetence, loss of weight, and greenish diarrhea after day 6 PE.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rates of infection of dried ticks with agents of main tick-borne bacterial infections (tick borreliosis and anaplasmosis) were determined by nested PCR. RESULTS: In May-June 2006, 76 ticks (40 adult females, 36 adult, males) belonged to Ixodes ricinus species were captured by the method  on flag . Number of ticks on the chosen terrain was 1.77 ticks per km2. 22.4% of ticks (12 females and 5 males) were positive for the agent of tick borreliosis--spirochete <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi sensu lato which is pathogenic for humans. The main detected pathogen was Euro-Asian genovariant of B. garinii--7 female and 5 male ticks (70.6% from total number of infected ticks) were infected with it. Five female ticks were infected with genovariant of B. afzelii. One female tick (1.2%) was infected with B. valaisiana.

For this purpose, 44 hunting dogs from the Central Upper-Rhine region were tested between 4(th) and 29(th) June 2007. The blood samples were tested using the Knott's test and IDEXX SNAP 4Dx test. The Knott's test revealed unsheathed microfilaria identified as Dirofilaria repens by PCR in 3 dogs with no history of travelling (6.8%; 95% CI: 2.4-18.2%). The seroprevalence for Anaplasma phagocytophilum was 43.2% (95% CI: 29.7-57.8%), but only 4.5% (95% CI: 1.3-15.1%) for antibodies to <e>Borrelia</e> C6 peptide.

19561077,"Identification of the determinant conferring permissive substrate usage in the telomere resolvase, ResT.Linear genome stability requires specialized telomere replication and protection mechanisms. A common solution to this problem in non-eukaryotes is the formation of hairpin telomeres by telomere resolvases (also known as protelomerases). These enzymes perform a two-step transesterification on replication intermediates to generate hairpin telomeres using an active site similar to that of tyrosine recombinases and type IB topoisomerases. Unlike phage telomere resolvases, the telomere resolvase from the Lyme disease pathogen <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi (ResT) is a permissive enzyme that resolves several types of telomere in vitro. However, the ResT region and residues mediating permissive substrate usage have not been identified. The relapsing fever Borrelia hermsii ResT exhibits a more restricted substrate usage pattern than B. burgdorferi ResT and cannot efficiently resolve a Type 2 telomere. In this study, we determined that all relapsing fever ResTs process Type 2 telomeres inefficiently. Using a library of chimeric and mutant B. hermsii/B. burgdorferi ResTs, we mapped the determinants in B. burgdorferi ResT conferring the ability to resolve multiple Type 2 telomeres. Type 2 telomere resolution was dependent on a single proline in the ResT catalytic region that was conserved in all Lyme disease but not relapsing fever ResTs and that is part of a 2-amino acid insertion absent from phage telomere resolvase sequences. The identification of a permissive substrate usage determinant explains the ability of B. burgdorferi ResT to process the 19 unique telomeres found in its segmented genome and will aid further studies on the structure and function of this essential enzyme.",M2
19489923,"Relapsing fever borreliosis in Eurasia--forgotten, but certainly not gone!Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) has been reported in Eurasia and attributed mainly to <e>Borrelia</e> persica, although other entities have also been described. Ornithodoros tholozani is the most important tick vector, found in India and Kashmir, the southern countries of the former USSR, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Turkey, Israel, Egypt, and Cyprus. It inhabits caves, ruins, and burrows of rodents and small mammals. In the northern countries, O. tholozani also lives in houses and cowsheds. In Israel, 30-60% of caves were found to be infested. PCR studies of Borrelia infection of O. tholozani ticks collected in caves showed very variable rates, ranging from less than 2% to 40%. The number of human cases reported varies among countries, from eight cases per year in Israel to 72 cases per year in Iran. The incubation period is 5-9 days. The fever attacks last from several hours to 4 days, and are accompanied by chills, headache, nausea and vomiting, sweating, abdominal pain, arthralgia, and cough; complications are rare. Other described Borrelia species are Borrelia caucasica, Borrelia latyschewii, Borrelia microtii, and Borrelia baltazardi. The classic taxonomy based on the co-speciation concept is very complex and very confusing. For this reason, 16S rRNA and flaB genes were used for taxonomic clarification. Sequencing of Israeli TBRF flaB genes, from human and tick samples, has demonstrated a third cluster corresponding to the Eurasia strains, in addition to both New World and Old World clusters. Thin and thick blood smears remain the most frequently used methods for laboratory diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 80%.

19489922,"New concepts for the old challenge of African relapsing fever borreliosis.Relapsing fever, caused by spirochaetes belonging to the genus <e>Borrelia</e>, was once the cause of worldwide epidemic disease. This was largely through infection with the louse-borne form of the disease, caused by Borrelia recurrentis (louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF)). During the last century, we have witnessed the demise of this infection, largely owing to improved standards of living and the introduction of the insecticide DDT, resulting in a reduction in the incidence of the body louse, the vector for relapsing fever. In areas of extreme poverty this disease persists, causing a significant burden of disease. It is now looking probable that this infection is caused by a louse-adapted variant of Borrelia duttonii, transmitted by Ornithodoros moubata 'soft' ticks in East Africa. Like LBRF, infection still causes impact, particularly affecting young children and pregnant women. Over recent years, the true burden of relapsing fever caused by infection with the closely related Borrelia crocidurae, transmitted by Ornithodoros sonrai ticks, has only just begun to emerge. Here, the current state of knowledge concerning relapsing fever in Africa is reviewed.",M2
19486001,"Lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (Jessner-Kanof) but not reticular erythematous mucinosis occasionally represents clinical manifestations of <e>Borrelia</e>-associated pseudolymphoma.BACKGROUND: Lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (LIS) and reticular erythematous mucinosis (REM) are characterized histologically by an inflammatory cutaneous lymphocytic infiltrate similar to the histological appearance of pseudolymphoma. OBJECTIVES: To re-evaluate a large cohort of patients with the clinical and/or histological diagnosis or differential diagnosis of LIS and REM and to assess the evidence for infection with Borrelia. METHODS: Sixty-nine cases of LIS and 34 cases of REM were retrospectively investigated. Haematoxylin and eosin sections were re-examined, and histological diagnoses were specified and confirmed by clinicopathological correlation. Evidence for Borrelia infection was assessed by immunohistochemistry and focus-floating microscopy (FFM). RESULTS: LIS appeared to serve as a collective term for two main clinicopathological reaction patterns: (i) (tumid) lupus erythematosus (LE) (32 of 69, 46%) and (ii) pseudolymphoma (31 of 69, 45%). Other diagnoses (five of 69, 7%) included polymorphic light eruption, arthropod bite reaction, spongiotic dermatitis, drug eruption and urticaria. Spirochaetes were detected by FFM in 24 of 31 (77%) cases with a pseudolymphomatous reaction, while all nonpseudolymphomatous reactions were negative. Of the cases initially considered as REM, 21 of 34 (62%) were classified as LE, four of 34 (12%) as pseudolymphoma (three of four positive for Borrelia), and five of 34 (15%) as other diagnoses (folliculitis, morphoea, seborrhoeic dermatitis, prurigo and arthropod bite reaction). The diagnosis of Borrelia-associated pseudolymphoma was made significantly more often in those cases where LIS was considered as initial differential diagnosis than REM (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: LIS and REM seem to represent clinicopathological reaction patterns. Our results confirm that, after accurate clinicopathological correlation, most cases of both conditions constitute hidden variants of LE. Furthermore, LIS, in contrast to REM, frequently comprises pseudolymphomatous reactions including borrelial lymphocytoma.",M2

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 38 CS specimens by immunohistochemistry with polyclonal anti-<e>Borrelia</e> antibody and assessment by FFM. RESULTS: Specimens of 34.2% CS were positive for 'Borrelia-like' organisms by FFM. Usually single spirochetes, rarely pairs or small clusters of bacteria were observed between collagen bundles or at the periphery of granulomas. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in addition in 11 cases and was negative in all biopsies. Samples of erythema migrans served as positive controls: 92.3% of 39 samples were positive by FFM, but only 46.6% gave positive results by PCR. Of 61 negative controls only one specimen was falsely positive by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: Detection of 'Borrelia-like' organisms by FFM in tissue sections of CS underlines the possibility that such microorganism maybe involved in the pathogenesis of some cases of CS.",M2
19458267,"Roles for phagocytic cells and complement in controlling relapsing fever infection.Relapsing fever spirochetes, such as <e>Borrelia</e> hermsii, proliferate to high levels in their hosts' bloodstream until production of IgM against borrelial surface proteins promotes bacterial clearance. The mechanisms by which B. hermsii survives in host blood, as well as the immune mediators that control this infection, remain largely unknown. It has been hypothesized that B. hermsii is naturally resistant to killing by the alternative pathway of complement activation as a result of its ability to bind factor H, a host complement regulator. However, we found that Cfh(-/-) mice were infected to levels identical to those seen in wild-type mice. Moreover, only a small minority of B. hermsii in the blood of wild-type mice had detectable levels of factor H adhered to their outer surfaces. In vitro, complement was found to play a statistically significant role in antibody-mediated inactivation of B. hermsii, although in vivo studies indicated that complement is not essential for host control of B. hermsii. Depletion of mphi and DC from mice had significant impacts on B. hermsii infection, and depleted mice were unable to control bloodstream infections, leading to death. Infection studies using muMT indicated a significant antibody-independent role for mphi and/or DC in host control of relapsing fever infection. Together, these findings indicate mphi and/or DC play a critical role in the production of B. hermsii-specific IgM and for antibody-independent control of spirochete levels.",M2

We report that IgM from both mice and human patients infected with B. hermsii not only reacted with the previously identified variable membrane proteins but also identified candidate antigens including heat-shock proteins, an adhesin protein, ABC transporter proteins, flagellar proteins, housekeeping proteins, an immune evasion protein, and proteins with unknown function. Furthermore, IgM reactivity to recombinant glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase was detected during early spirochaete infection and prior to a detectable IgG response. Lastly, a conserved hypothetical protein was produced in Escherichia coli and tested with immune serum against B. hermsii and Borrelia recurrentis. These results identify a much larger set of immunoreactive proteins, and could help in the early serodiagnosis of this tick-borne infection.",M2

For many reasons, the incidence of disease is on decrease, however tick-borne relapsing fever is still a health issue in the rural areas for travelers. This study was carried out during 1997-2006 to investigate the tick-borne relapsing fever in Iran. METHODS: Based on a cross-sectional, retrospective and descriptive study in all the provinces, the residents in the endemic areas who were febrile and suspicious to tick-borne relapsing fever were enrolled in the study. Tick-borne relapsing fever is a notifiable disease in Iran and the national communicable disease surveillance data were used through questionnaires. The infectivity of Ornithodoros species to <e>Borrelia</e> also was studied in two highly endemic areas including Hamadan and Qazvin provinces. RESULTS: During 1997-2006, a total of 1415 cases have been reported from the entire country. The highest prevalence was observed in year 2002 with the incidence rate of 0.41/100,000 population. Ardabil province is the first ranked infected area (625 out of 1415), followed by Hamadan, Zanjan, Kurdestan and Qazvin provinces sequentially. The disease is recorded during the whole year but its peak occurs during summer and autumn. There have been 87.6% of the cases recorded from June to November. Forty five percent of the infected cases were male and one third of the patients were under 5 years of age. Fifty four percent of the patients comprise the children under 10 years. Ninety two percent of the cases were living in rural areas where their dwellings were close to animal shelters. They were involved mainly with farming and animal husbandry activities. All the febrile patients with confirmed spirochetes in their blood samples were treated according to a national guideline for tick-borne relapsing fever treatment. Only 7% of the patients were hospitalized and 0.8% of them exhibited the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The study of infectivity of Ornithodoros species to Borrelia revealed that Ornithodoros tholozani was infected with Borrelia persica and Ornithodoros erraticus with Borrelia microti. CONCLUSION: Travelers to the rural areas with high prevalence of the disease should be made aware of the risk of tick-borne relapsing fever and use of appropriate control measures. Communicable disease surveillance including tick-borne relapsing fever should be pursued as well.",M2

Length of sequenced fragment of rrfA-rrlB region was 253 b.p. Seven isolates had 100% and 3 - 99.6% similarity with typical strain NT29 (L30130). Nucleotide sequences of 4 obtained isolates were deposited in GenBank database (No. AM932199 - AM932202). It was proposed that B. garinii NT29 more frequently than other Borrelia species can be an etiologic agent of tick-borne borreliosis not only in Perm region but also in whole Russia.",M2
19308255,"<e>Borrelia</e> recurrentis employs a novel multifunctional surface protein with anti-complement, anti-opsonic and invasive potential to escape innate immunity.Borrelia recurrentis, the etiologic agent of louse-borne relapsing fever in humans, has evolved strategies, including antigenic variation, to evade immune defence, thereby causing severe diseases with high mortality rates. Here we identify for the first time a multifunctional surface lipoprotein of B. recurrentis, termed HcpA, and demonstrate that it binds human complement regulators, Factor H, CFHR-1, and simultaneously, the host protease plasminogen. Cell surface bound factor H was found to retain its activity and to confer resistance to complement attack. Moreover, ectopic expression of HcpA in a B. burgdorferi B313 strain, deficient in Factor H binding proteins, protected the transformed spirochetes from complement-mediated killing. Furthermore, HcpA-bound plasminogen/plasmin endows B. recurrentis with the potential to resist opsonization and to degrade extracellular matrix components. Together, the present study underscores the high virulence potential of B. recurrentis. The elucidation of the molecular basis underlying the versatile strategies of B. recurrentis to escape innate immunity and to persist in human tissues, including the brain, may help to understand the pathological processes underlying louse-borne relapsing fever.",M2

19281412,"Characterization of a novel relapsing fever spirochete in the midgut, coxal fluid, and salivary glands of the bat tick Carios kelleyi.Bat ticks, Carios kelleyi, from Iowa were examined for the presence of relapsing fever group borreliae. A novel spirochete was characterized by DNA sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons for the 16S rRNA, flaB, and glpQ genes in either triturated tick pools or single ticks. All loci and the concatenated DNA sequence of 3,289 bases identified the Carios bacterium as a relapsing fever spirochete most closely related to, but distinct from, <e>Borrelia</e> turicatae. Spirochetes reactive with a Borrelia-specific monoclonal antibody were observed microscopically in the coxal fluid and salivary glands from one tick. These data confirm the presence of a novel species of relapsing fever spirochete in bat ticks and the potential for new enzootic foci for endemic relapsing fever that warrants further investigation. The name Borrelia johnsonii is proposed for this novel spirochete in honor of Dr. Russell C. Johnson.",M2
19267927,"Intergenic regions of <e>Borrelia</e> plasmids contain phylogenetically conserved RNA secondary structure motifs.BACKGROUND: Borrelia species are unusual in that they contain a large number of linear and circular plasmids. Many of these plasmids have long intergenic regions. These regions have many fragmented genes, repeated sequences and appear to be in a state of flux, but they may serve as reservoirs for evolutionary change and/or maintain stable motifs such as small RNA genes. RESULTS: In an in silico study, intergenic regions of Borrelia plasmids were scanned for phylogenetically conserved stem loop structures that may represent functional units at the RNA level. Five repeat sequences were found that could fold into stable RNA-type stem loop structures, three of which are closely linked to protein genes, one of which is a member of the Borrelia lipoprotein_1 super family genes and another is the complement regulator-acquiring surface protein_1 (CRASP-1) family. Modeled secondary structures of repeat sequences display numerous base-pair compensatory changes in stem regions, including C-G--&gt;A-U transversions when orthologous sequences are compared. Base-pair compensatory changes constitute strong evidence for phylogenetic conservation of secondary structure. CONCLUSION: Intergenic regions of Borrelia species carry evolutionarily stable RNA secondary structure motifs. Of major interest is that some motifs are associated with protein genes that show large sequence variability. The cell may conserve these RNA motifs whereas allow a large flux in amino acid sequence, possibly to create new virulence factors but with associated RNA motifs intact.",M2
19187198,"Molecular detection of <e>Borrelia</e> bissettii DNA in serum samples from patients in the Czech Republic with suspected borreliosis.Until recently, three spirochete genospecies were considered to be the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis (LB) in Europe: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii. However, the DNA of Borrelia valaisiana, Borrelia lusitaniae, Borrelia spielmanii and Borrelia bissettii has already been detected in samples of human origin, or the spirochetes were isolated from the patients with symptoms of LB. Molecular analysis of 12 selected serum samples collected in the regional hospital confirmed the presence of B. bissettii DNA in cases of single and multiple infection in patients with symptomatic borreliosis or chronic borrelial infection. The presence of B. bissettii as a single strain in patients provides strong support of the fact that B. bissettii might be a causative agent of the disease. After the first isolation of B. bissettii from the samples of human origin in Slovenia, following the detection of this species in cardiac valve tissue of the patient with endocarditis and aortic valve stenosis in the Czech Republic, here we present additional molecular data supporting the involvement of B. bissettii in LB in Europe.",M2
18836006,"Variations in Ixodes ricinus density and <e>Borrelia</e> infections associated with cattle introduced into a woodland in The Netherlands.The effect of introduced large herbivores on the abundance of Ixodes ricinus ticks and their Borrelia infections was studied in a natural woodland in The Netherlands. Oak and pine plots, either ungrazed or grazed by cattle, were selected. Ticks were collected weekly by blanket dragging. Borrelia infections were determined by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Rodent densities were estimated using mark-release-recapture methods. On occasion, the cattle were inspected for tick infestations. Meteorological data were recorded for each habitat. Significantly more ticks were collected in the ungrazed woodland than in the grazed woodland. The ungrazed oak habitat had higher tick densities than the pine habitat, while in the grazed habitats, tick densities were similar. Borrelia infection rates ranged from zero in larvae to 26% in nymphs to 33% in adult ticks, and B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. valaisiana were the species involved. Coinfections were found in five ticks. There was no effect of the presence of cattle on Borrelia infections in the ticks. In the ungrazed area, Borrelia infections in nymphs were significantly higher in the oak habitat than in the pine habitat. More mice were captured in the ungrazed area, and these had a significantly higher tick burden than mice from the grazed area. Tick burden on cattle was low. The results suggest that grazing has a negative effect on small rodents as well as on ticks but not on Borrelia infections. Implications of these results for management of woodland reserves and risk of Lyme disease are discussed.",M2
18800002,"Skin homing of Treponema pallidum in early syphilis: an immunohistochemical study.The incidence of syphilis is increasing in most parts of the world including some major European cities. The lesions developing during secondary syphilis may be difficult to diagnose clinically. Similarly, the histopathologic changes do not always fulfill the typical diagnostic criteria. The objective of this study was to assess the contribution of immunohistochemistry for the identification and localization of Treponema pallidum on the skin. We retrieved from our files 12 paraffin-embedded biopsies of skin lesions, which had posed diagnostic problems in the past. Only a serologic test had proven that the patients had syphilis. Controls consisted of lichenoid dermatoses unrelated to syphilis and borreliosis. Immunohistochemistry using an antispirochete (T. pallidum and <e>Borrelia</e>) antibody was performed retrospectively. In all samples from primary and secondary syphilis, T. pallidum was highlighted, but none of the control lesions unrelated to syphilis showed positivity. Interestingly enough, T. pallidum present in the lower mid-part of the epidermis often outnumbered that in the dermis. This difference was more striking in secondary syphilis compared with primary syphilis. Immunohistochemistry for T. pallidum considerably increased the sensitivity and the specificity of the histologic diagnosis. The strong epidermal homing of T. pallidum is highlighted in early syphilis.",M2
18791841,"<e>Borrelia</e> antibodies in children evaluated for Lyme neuroborreliosis.BACKGROUND: We wanted to elucidate the value of Borrelia antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed the serological findings, by anti-flagellin assay, in 267 patients with neurological symptoms from the Stockholm area, where Lyme borreliosis is endemic. RESULTS: In the 70 children with LNB, intrathecal Borrelia antibody production was diagnostic and found in 50 (71%). Sixteen (23%) showed an elevated antibody titer in serum only, and 4 (7%) had no serologic findings. Borrelia IgG in serum, with or without concomitant IgM, was a specific (98%), but insensitive (43%) marker of infection. Isolated, false-positive serum IgM titers were common and found in 10 of 67 children (15%) with viral meningitis, as well as in 28 of 111 (25%) with various neurological symptoms and normal CSF. The specificity of an isolated Borrelia IgM titer in serum was 81%, and the positive predictive value for Borrelia infection only 50% in our material. On the other hand, absence of antibodies in blood had a negative predictive value of 94%, which increased to 97% if also CSF findings were included. CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal antibody production is strongly supportive of an LNB diagnosis. Conversely, isolated, elevated levels of Borrelia IgM in serum occur in up to one-fourth of children with various neurological complaints, and should be interpreted with caution, especially in nonendemic areas.",M2

We report a case of Lyme meningovascularitis complicated with multiple IS. CASE REPORT: A 64-year-old man, without any cardiovascular risk factor, was admitted for a right hemiparesia with a left thalamic hypodensity on the initial cerebral CT scan. No cause for this presumed IS could be identified. Later, the patient developed cognitive impairment and a bilateral cerebellar syndrome. Multiple infarcts and multiple intracranial stenosis were seen on cerebral MRI with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Cerebrospinal fluid tests showed meningitis and positive Lyme serology with an intrathecal specific anti-<e>Borrelia</e> antibody index. Antibiotic treatment was followed by good biological and partial clinicoradiological outcome. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis should be entertained as a possible cause of IS in highly endemic zones.",M2
18757545,"Oms38 is the first identified pore-forming protein in the outer membrane of relapsing fever spirochetes.Relapsing fever is a worldwide, endemic disease caused by several spirochetal species belonging to the genus <e>Borrelia</e>. During the recurring fever peaks, borreliae proliferate remarkably quickly compared to the slow dissemination of Lyme disease Borrelia and therefore require efficient nutrient uptake from the blood of their hosts. This study describes the identification and characterization of the first relapsing fever porin, which is present in the outer membranes of B. duttonii, B. hermsii, B. recurrentis, and B. turicatae. The pore-forming protein was purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography and designated Oms38, for outer membrane-spanning protein of 38 kDa. Biophysical characterization of Oms38 was done by using the black lipid bilayer method, demonstrating that Oms38 forms small, water-filled channels of 80 pS in 1 M KCl that did not exhibit voltage-dependent closure. The Oms38 channel is slightly selective for anions and shows a ratio of permeability for cations over anions of 0.41 in KCl. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences demonstrated that Oms38 contains an N-terminal signal sequence which is processed under in vivo conditions. Oms38 is highly conserved within the four studied relapsing fever species, sharing an overall amino acid identity of 58% and with a strong indication for the presence of amphipathic beta-sheets.",M2
18721189,"New concepts on erythema annulare centrifugum: a clinical reaction pattern that does not represent a specific clinicopathological entity.BACKGROUND: Erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC) is considered an inflammatory skin disease with unknown aetiology. In most textbooks it is assigned to the incoherent conglomeration of figurate or gyrate erythemas. OBJECTIVES: To re-evaluate a large cohort of patients with EAC and to assess the evidence for infection with <e>Borrelia</e>. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 90 cases with the diagnosis of EAC. Haematoxylin and eosin sections were re-examined and diagnoses were specified; these were then confirmed by clinicopathological correlation. Infection with Borrelia was assessed by focus-floating microscopy and by a Borrelia-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Besides a miscellaneous group of annular disorders at times confused with EAC such as urticaria, leucocytoclastic vasculitis and psoriasis (20 of 90; 22%), EAC appeared to serve as a collective term for three main clinicopathological reaction patterns: (i) (tumid) lupus erythematosus (29 of 90; 32%), (ii) spongiotic dermatitides (25 of 90; 28%) and (iii) pseudolymphoma (16 of 90; 18%). In 13 of 16 (81%) cases with a pseudolymphomatous reaction pattern spirochaetes stained positive but were negative in other reaction patterns of EAC as well as in negative controls. These findings were confirmed by a Borrelia-specific PCR which was positive in two of three (67%) of these pseudolymphomatous EAC cases but was negative in all other variants of EAC (none of five) as well as 20 controls. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 'EAC' is a clinical reaction pattern that does not represent a specific clinicopathological entity and should lead to consideration of mainly lupus erythematosus, dermatitis and, in some cases, cutaneous Lyme disease.",M2
18641346,"IL-10 helps control pathogen load during high-level bacteremia.During relapsing fever borreliosis, a high pathogen load in the blood occurs at times of peak bacteremia. Specific IgM Abs are responsible for spirochetal clearance so in absence of B cells there is persistent high-level bacteremia. Previously, we showed that B cell-deficient mice persistently infected with <e>Borrelia</e> turicatae produce high levels of IL-10 and that exogenous IL-10 reduces bacteremia. This suggested that IL-10 helps reduce bacteremia at times of high pathogen load by a B cell-independent mechanism, most likely involving innate immunity. To investigate this possibility, we compared B. turicatae infection in RAG2/IL-10(-/-) and RAG2(-/-) mice. The results showed that IL-10 deficiency resulted in significantly higher bacteremia, higher TNF levels, and early mortality. Examination of the spleen and peripheral blood showed markedly increased apoptosis of immune cells in infected RAG2/IL-10(-/-) mice. Neutralization of TNF reduced apoptosis of leukocytes and splenocytes, increased production of IFN-gamma by NK cells, increased phagocytosis in the spleen, decreased spirochetemia, and rescued mice from early death. Our results indicate that at times of high pathogen load, as during peak bacteremia in relapsing fever borreliosis, IL-10 protects innate immune cells from apoptosis via inhibition of TNF resulting in improved pathogen control.",M2
18637723,"Relapsing fever spirochetes retain infectivity after prolonged in vitro cultivation.<e>Borrelia</e> hermsii and Borrelia burgdorferi, two closely related spirochetes, are the etiological agents of tick-borne relapsing fever and Lyme disease, respectively. Previous studies have shown the loss of infectivity of B. burgdorferi is associated with in vitro cultivation. This diminished infectivity of B. burgdorferi has occurred as early as three in vitro passages, and the loss of plasmids have been observed with these less virulent to noninfective cultures. The effects of long-term in vitro cultivation on B. hermsii have not been investigated. However, understanding the degree of genomic degradation during in vitro cultivation is important for investigating pathogenic mechanisms of spirochetes. In this study, we analyzed the effects of continuous in vitro cultivation on the genomic composition and infectivity of B. hermsii and B. turicatae.We report that all seven isolates of B. hermsii and the one isolate of B. turicatae examined retained infectivity in mice after 1 year of continuous in vitro cultivation. Furthermore, there were few apparent differences in the plasmid profiles after long-term cultivation. Two isolates of B. hermsii remained infective after high passage despite losing a portion of the 200-kb linear plasmid containing the fhbA gene encoding the factor H binding protein. Also, sequence analysis of multiple B. hermsii isolates demonstrated two types of fhbA with complete congruence with the two genomic groups of B. hermsii spirochetes. Therefore, these results suggest that relapsing fever spirochetes are genetically stable during in vitro cultivation, and the fhbA-containing segment of DNA that is lost during cultivation is not required for infection.",M2

Four hundred fifty Haemaphysalis longicornis and 86 Ixodes sinensis ticks were collected and divided into 236 groups. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or nested PCR was used to detect the bacteria. The amplicons were sequenced and compared to published sequences. Phylogenic analysis was performed with MEGA3.1 and the data were analyzed using SPSS 11.0. Borrelia, Bartonella, Anaplasma, and Ehrlichia positive rates were 30.1% (71/236), 28.8% (68/236), 1.3% (3/236), and 0.8% (2/236), respectively. One tick was coinfected with all four bacteria (Borrelia, Bartonella, Anaplasma, and Ehrlichia) and another group was coinfected with three bacteria, Borrelia, Bartonella, and Ehrlichia. Statistical analysis showed most coinfections were significant, indicating that once a tick was infected with one bacteria, there was a greater chance to be infected with another bacteria.",M2
18616764,"Granuloma annulare--a manifestation of infection with <e>Borrelia</e>?BACKGROUND: Among the theories of origin of granuloma annulare (GA) are those of infection. Reports gave raise to the assumption that there is evidence for Borrelia as the causing agent. METHODS: To assess the evidence for infection with Borrelia in GA, tissue sections were stained with a polyclonal Borrelia antibody. With focus-floating microscopy (FFM), slides were scanned at a 200- to 400-fold magnification. Part of the material was also investigated with a Borrelia-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: A total of 157 biopsies of GA have been investigated. Using FFM, Borrelia were detected in 127 cases of GA (80.9%). Borrelia were more prominent in localized (85.2%) than in diffuse GA (62.1%). In 27 cases of GA analysed by PCR, Borrelia-specific DNA could be detected in only one case (3.7%), but was positive in 21 cases by FFM (77.8%). About 93.3% of 15 control cases of borreliosis were positive with FFM and 46.7% with PCR, while all controls other than borreliosis remained negative for spirochetes. CONCLUSION: FFM is a reliable method to show Borrelia in tissue sections of GA, which is more sensitive than PCR. This underlines the possibility that Borrelia are involved specifically in the aetiology and pathogenesis of GA.",M2

Seven days after the beginning of a primary culture of embryonic cells of B. microplus at 31 degrees C was noted that the cells start suffering degeneration. Under examination at phase contrast microscope, the presence of prolongated microorganisms with great mobility was detected.

18533451,"Temporal variations in the usefulness of normalized difference vegetation index as a predictor for Ixodes ricinus (Acari: Ixodidae) in a <e>Borrelia</e> lusitaniae focus in Tuscany, central Italy.Host-seeking ticks were collected during monthly dragging sessions from November 2004 through October 2006 in Tuscany, central Italy. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which was calculated from Landsat ETM+ 7 remote sensing data recorded in August 2001, was significantly correlated with numbers of host-seeking immature Ixodes ricinus L. (Acari: Ixodidae) during periods of relatively low rainfall such as summer 2005 (Spearman's p = 0.78, P &lt; 0.001 for nymphs in July) and to a lower extent in spring-summer 2006. In spring 2005, when rainfall was relatively high, the correlation was weak and not statistically significant. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs), taking into account repeated sampling of the same dragging sites, were used to model the effects of NDVI and season on counts of host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs. Seasonal variations of the effect of NDVI yielded a significant NDVI-by-season interaction in the first year of the study (November 2004-October 2005), but not in the second year (November 2005-October 2006) when there was a 2.5-fold increase of the number of nymphs per 100-m dragging for every 0.1 unit increase in NDVI (95% confidence interval = 1.6, 3.0). Risk maps that were obtained based on GEE results confirmed that the predicted number of I. ricinus nymphs per 100 m was relatively homogeneous through the study area during the 2005 spring peak of activity. Conversely, in 2006, the predicted abundance of nymphs was greater in moist bottomland habitat (characterized by high NDVI) than in dry, typically Mediterranean, upland habitat.",M2

18454594,"<e>Borrelia</e> bissettii isolates induce pathology in a murine model of disease.The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is a tick-borne pathogen that causes Lyme disease. Although B. burgdorferi sensu lato is a diverse group of bacteria, only three genospecies, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii, are known to be pathogenic and commonly recognized to cause human disease. To assess the potential of another common genospecies, Borrelia bissettii, to induce disease, a mouse model was employed. Two Colorado isolates of B. bissettii (CO-Bb) induced lesions of the bladder, heart, and femorotibial joint 8 weeks after inoculation into mice. In contrast, two British Columbia (BC-Bb) isolates, could not be cultured or amplified by PCR from target organs, and did not induce lesions. Consistent with pathology and culture results, the antibody response in mice to BC-Bb was minimal compared to CO-Bb, indicating either transient localized infection or rapid immune clearance of BC-Bb. Although sequence analysis of the rrf (5S)-rrl (23S) intergenic spacer region indicated 99% homology between CO-Bb and BC-Bb, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis indicated five distinct protein differences between these low-passage isolates. These studies support the prospect that B. bissettii may indeed be the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis cases in Eastern Europe, associated with the atypical Borrelia strain 25015, and in other regions. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that B. bissettii can induce pathology in a vertebrate host.",M2
18454593,"Absence of transovarial transmission of <e>Borrelia</e> duttonii, a tick-borne relapsing fever agent, by the vector tick Ornithodoros moubata.We examined the vector competence of the tick, Ornithodoros moubata, using laboratory-reared gerbils as hosts. Transmission of the relapsing fever agent Borrelia duttonii occurred efficiently from infected ticks to uninfected gerbils and from infected gerbils to uninfected ticks. Spirochetes were maintained stably in the ticks for at least 3 months, but they disappeared from the bloodstream of infected gerbils after three episodes of spirochetemia. We also examined transovarial transmission of B. duttonii during the gonotrophic cycle and filial generation. No spirochetes could be detected from the offspring generation of the ticks by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, although spirochetes were still found in the female ticks. The results indicate that, because of the rarity of transovarial infection, the role of transovarial passage of B. duttonii to eggs and larval O. moubata ticks is limited in maintaining B. duttonii. Our findings strongly suggest that B. duttonii is maintained through the O. moubata tick-human transmission cycle in tick-borne relapsing fever endemic areas.",M2
18429696,"Experimental and field studies on the suitability of raccoons (Procyon lotor) as hosts for tick-borne pathogens.We investigated the experimental susceptibility and natural exposure of raccoons (Procyon lotor) to five tick-borne pathogens of human and veterinary importance, Ehrlichia canis, E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (ApVariant 1 and Ap-ha HGE-1 strains), and <e>Borrelia</e> lonestari. Infections were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) testing, and/or culture isolation methods for at least 30 days postinoculation (DPI). Two E. chaffeensis-inoculated raccoons seroconverted and were transiently PCR positive. One raccoon was culture positive. Laboratory raised Amblyomma americanum nymphs fed on a third infected raccoon failed to become infected. Two A. phagocytophilum (HGE-1)-inoculated raccoons became PCR positive and seroconverted. Both remained positive for at least 74 DPI. In contrast, raccoons inoculated with A. phagocytophilum (Ap-Variant 1) were only transiently PCR positive and only seroconverted with low titers. No evidence of infection was observed for E. ewingii- and B. lonestari-inoculated raccoons. Only one E. canis-inoculated raccoon was PCR positive 3 DPI. Serologic testing of wild raccoons from five populations (3 infested with ticks) in Georgia and Florida showed antibodies reactive with E. chaffeensis in the 3 tick-infested populations (range of 30%-46%), E. canis in the same three populations (8%-23%), A. phagocytophilum in a single raccoon from Florida (12%), and Borrelia spp. in all 5 populations (8%-53%). All raccoons were PCR negative for tick-borne pathogens. These data suggest that raccoons are likely not important reservoirs of E. canis, E. ewingii, or B. lonestari. However, raccoons are experimentally susceptible and naturally exposed to E. chaffeensis, and these data support the previous finding that raccoons may be involved in the natural history of A. phagocytophilum.",M2
18424744,"Bactericidal action of a complement-independent antibody against relapsing fever <e>Borrelia</e> resides in its variable region.A single chain variable fragment (scFv) of CB515, a complement-independent bactericidal monoclonal IgM against a relapsing fever Borrelia, was constructed to investigate the region wherein the unique bactericidal function resides. Monomeric CB515 scFv (26 kDa) was capable of binding its Ag on whole organisms and by immunoblot. This binding was shown to be species and serotype-specific to the 19 kDa variable small protein, recognized by its parent monoclonal IgM. A dose-dependent bactericidal effect of the CB515 scFv was detected by direct enumeration of spirochetes. Spirochetes incubated with the CB515 scFv before inoculation into mice grew into escape mutants, whereas spirochetes incubated with an irrelevant scFv developed as the original infecting serotype. This bactericidal effect, as seen at the ultrastructural level, was due to disruption of the outer membrane and to severe membrane blebbing eventually progressing to lysis. These results indicate that the variable region of CB515 is responsible for this bactericidal activity and that the constant region of the Ab is dispensable.",M2

A fragment of specific Borrelia DNA was amplified through PCR in one sample, and the PCR product was further analyzed by reverse line blotting assay, whereby both genospecies of B. garinii and B. valaisiana were proved. This sample pooled five chigger larvae collected from one Sylvia atricapilla on 11 August 2005. No A. phagocytophilum DNA was amplified. We conclude that larvae of the genus Neotrombicula can be infected with Borrelia genospecies originated from their present or former hosts.",M2
18367205,"High-resolution structure of a self-assembly-competent form of a hydrophobic peptide captured in a soluble beta-sheet scaffold.beta-Rich self-assembly is a major structural class of polypeptides, but still little is known about its atomic structures and biophysical properties. Major impediments for structural and biophysical studies of peptide self-assemblies include their insolubility and heterogeneous composition. We have developed a model system, termed peptide self-assembly mimic (PSAM), based on the single-layer beta-sheet of <e>Borrelia</e> outer surface protein A. PSAM allows for the capture of a defined number of self-assembly-like peptide repeats within a water-soluble protein, making structural and energetic studies possible. In this work, we extend our PSAM approach to a highly hydrophobic peptide sequence. We show that a penta-Ile peptide (Ile(5)), which is insoluble and forms beta-rich self-assemblies in aqueous solution, can be captured within the PSAM scaffold in a form capable of self-assembly. The 1.1-A crystal structure revealed that the Ile(5) stretch forms a highly regular beta-strand within this flat beta-sheet. Self-assembly models built with multiple copies of the crystal structure of the Ile(5) peptide segment showed no steric conflict, indicating that this conformation represents an assembly-competent form. The PSAM retained high conformational stability, suggesting that the flat beta-strand of the Ile(5) stretch primed for self-assembly is a low-energy conformation of the Ile(5) stretch and rationalizing its high propensity for self-assembly. The ability of the PSAM to  solubilize  an otherwise insoluble peptide stretch suggests the potential of the PSAM approach to the characterization of self-assembling peptides.",M2
18355299,"Diversity of Ixodes ricinus tick-associated bacterial communities from different forests.Nymphal Ixodes ricinus ticks (n=180) were collected from three different areas in the Netherlands to investigate the effect of forest composition on tick-associated microbial communities. Sampled habitats differed in thickness of leaf litter and humus layers and vegetation associations and were located near Amsterdam (Beech-Oak), Ede (Birch-Oak) and Veldhoven (Birch-Oak). Analysis of nine 16S rRNA gene clone libraries made from individual ticks showed nearest matches with presumed pathogens Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis and Rickettsia australis and arthropod endosymbionts Wolbachia pipientis and Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii. Total bacterial species diversity (Shannon index) and <e>Borrelia</e> species infections were determined in I. ricinus by, respectively, PCR-denaturing gradient gel-electrophoresis and PCR-reverse line blot with probes specific for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii, Borrelia valaisiana, Borrelia lusitaniae and Borrelia ruski. Bacterial diversity differed significantly per area and was lowest in Ede. In contrast, Borrelia species-infected ticks were more abundant in Ede, Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis-infected ticks in Ede and Veldhoven, and R. australis-infected ticks in Amsterdam. Borrelia afzelii was the most common Borrelia species found in all three areas. Bacterial tick diversity was influenced by local differences in forest structure, which is proposed to modulate animal populations that are commonly parasitized by I. ricinus.",M2
18354209,"Complement factor H-binding protein, a putative virulence determinant of <e>Borrelia</e> hermsii, is an antigenic target for protective B1b lymphocytes.Vaccination is the most effective way to control infectious diseases. A variety of microbial pathogens use antigenic variation, an immune evasion strategy that poses a challenge for vaccine development. To understand protective immune responses against such pathogens, we have been studying Borrelia hermsii, a bacterium that causes recurrent bacteremia due to antigenic variation. An IgM response is necessary and sufficient to control B. hermsii infection. We have recently found a selective expansion of B1b cells concurrent with the resolution of B. hermsii bacteremia. B1b cells from convalescent but not naive mice confer long-lasting immunity, but the Ag(s) driving the protective IgM responses is unknown. Herein we demonstrate that convalescent B1b cell-derived IgM recognizes complement factor H-binding protein (FhbA), a B. hermsii outer-surface protein and putative virulence factor that does not undergo antigenic variation and is expressed by all clinical isolates. A progressive increase in the IgM response to FhbA correlated with the kinetics of B1b cell expansion, diminished the severity of bacteremic episodes, and led to the eventual resolution of the infection. These data indicate that FhbA is a specific target for protective B1b cell responses. Ags recognized by B1b cells may be considered as an important component in vaccination strategies.",M2
18346234,"Diagnostic value of sural nerve biopsy in patients with suspected <e>Borrelia</e> neuropathy.Peripheral neuropathy is a recognized but incompletely understood manifestation of borreliosis. As the pathology of this neuropathy has been described only in small case series, the value of nerve biopsy findings for the pathologic diagnosis of Borrelia-associated neuropathy is unclear. We collected and investigated 21 patients with peripheral neuropathy and with typical clinical and serologic signs of neuroborreliosis [Borrelia neuropathy (BN)]. Standard histology and immunohistochemistry were performed on sural nerve biopsies using antibodies to CD4, CD68 and membrane attack complex C5b-9, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6. Nine patients with idiopathic vasculitic neuropathy (VN) and 14 with idiopathic axonal neuropathy (AN) served as disease controls. In BN, the characteristic histology was that of an AN with transmural or perivascular lymphocytic infiltration of nerve vessels. In BN, but less in VN and AN, perineurial thickening and neovascularization were observed. For BN but not for VN, this thickening correlated with increased perineurial immunoreactivity (IR) to TNF-alpha, C5b-9, and ICAM-1. In comparison to AN, both BN and VN displayed increased perineurial T-cell infiltration and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR3-IR. In the endoneurium, cytokine (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha), HLA-DR3, and ICAM-1 expression was more pronounced in VN but not in BN. The neuropathy in patients with neuroborreliosis resembles idiopathic VN but shows some distinctive features. None of the findings of this study are disease specific but as a pattern may help support the diagnosis of inflammatory neuropathy in patients with serological evidence for Borrelia infection.",M2
18299341,"Identification of an antiparallel coiled-coil/loop domain required for ligand binding by the <e>Borrelia</e> hermsii FhbA protein: additional evidence for the role of FhbA in the host-pathogen interaction.Borrelia hermsii, an etiological agent of tick-borne relapsing fever in North America, binds host-derived serum proteins including factor H (FH), plasminogen, and an unidentified 60-kDa protein via its FhbA protein. Two distinct phylogenetic types of FhbA have been delineated (FhbA1 and FhbA2). These orthologs share a conserved C-terminal domain that contains two alpha helices with a high predictive probability of coiled-coil formation that are separated by a 14-amino-acid loop domain. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified residues within these domains that influence the binding of both mouse and human FH, plasminogen, and/or the 60-kDa protein. To further investigate the involvement of FhbA in the host-pathogen interaction, strains that are either FhbA(+) (isolate YOR) or FhbA(-) (isolate REN) were tested for serum sensitivity. Significant differences were observed, with YOR and REN being serum resistant and serum sensitive (intermediate), respectively. To test the abilities of these strains to infect and persist in mice, mice were needle inoculated, and infectivity and persistence were then assessed. While both strains REN and YOR infected mice, only the FhbA(+) YOR strain persisted beyond day 4. Survival of the YOR isolate in blood correlated with the upregulation of the fhbA gene, as demonstrated by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. These data advance our understanding of the unique interactions of FhbA with individual serum proteins and provide support for the hypothesis that FhbA is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of the relapsing fever spirochete B. hermsii.",M2

The focus of this chapter is to describe selectable markers, manipulation strategies, and methods to electro-transform and clone wild-type infectious Borrelia hermsii. Preliminary studies suggest that the variable tick protein (Vtp) of B. hermsii is involved in tick-to-mammal transmission. To address this hypothesis, we have developed a system for genetic manipulation and have constructed clones of a Vtp mutant and an isogenic reconstituted strain. The methods described here are applicable for the inactivation of other loci in B. hermsii and should be adaptable for other species of relapsing fever spirochetes.",M2

He had been bitten by an Ixodes persulcatus tick in which the DNA of Borrelia valaisiana was detected. The patient's symptoms improved rapidly after treatment with minocycline.

18070662,"An insight into the sialome of the soft tick, Ornithodorus parkeri.While hard ticks (Ixodidae) take several days to feed on their hosts, soft ticks (Argasidae) feed faster, usually taking less than 1h per meal. Saliva assists in the feeding process by providing a cocktail of anti-hemostatic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodullatory compounds. Saliva of hard ticks has been shown to contain several families of genes each having multiple members, while those of soft ticks are relatively unexplored. Analysis of the salivary transcriptome of the soft tick Ornithodorus parkeri, the vector of the relapsing fever agent <e>Borrelia</e> parkeri, indicates that gene duplication events have led to a large expansion of the lipocalin family, as well as of several genes containing Kunitz domains indicative of serine protease inhibitors, and several other gene families also found in hard ticks. Novel protein families with sequence homology to insulin growth factor-binding protein (prostacyclin-stimulating factor), adrenomedulin, serum amyloid A protein precursor and similar to HIV envelope protein were also characterized for the first time in the salivary gland of a blood-sucking arthropod. The sialotranscriptome of O. parkeri confirms that gene duplication events are an important driving force in the creation of salivary cocktails of blood-feeding arthropods, as was observed with hard ticks and mosquitoes. Most of the genes coding for expanded families are homologous to those found in hard ticks, indicating a strong common evolutionary path between the two families. As happens to all genera of blood-sucking arthropods, several new proteins were also found, indicating the process of adaptation to blood feeding still continues to recent times.",M2
18021022,"Does tick-borne relapsing fever have an animal reservoir in East Africa?Tick-borne relapsing fevers (TBRF) are caused by infection with <e>Borrelia</e> spirochetes and transmitted to humans by ticks. All except East African TBRF, caused by Borrelia duttonii, are known zoonoses. This widespread, endemic and pathogenic infection has only been found in humans and the Ornithodoros sp. soft tick vectors. We investigated the role of domestic animals as possible reservoirs of infection in a TBRF endemic region. Tick infestations in households and pigpens were investigated in the villages near Mvumi hospital in central Tanzania. Blood from chickens and pigs was examined by PCR and flagellin gene sequencing was performed on any Borrelia sp. infections detected. A mark-recapture experiment investigated tick movement between pigpens and houses. The acceptability of chickens as tick hosts was also investigated. Tick infestation of the 122 houses investigated was high (47%). Pigpens also were tick infested (16%) and were more likely to be so if they were located close to tick infested households (p&lt;0.001). PCR screening of peripheral blood found Borrelia infections in both chickens and pigs (11% and 8.9% respectively). Sequencing of a subset of positive samples revealed that the amplified Borrelia sp. flagellin gene fragments shared greatest homology with B. duttonii. In a mark-recapture experiment, ticks released in pigpens were recaptured inside human bedrooms. When offered chickens as hosts, over 20% of ticks fed. For the first time in East Africa, we record natural infections of Borrelia in domestic animals and show that tick populations may act as bridging vectors between animals and humans. These results, from villages where B. duttonii is already known to be prevalent and a major cause of illness in humans, and where it has been found at high levels in ticks, strongly support the case that it is a zoonosis. This increases understanding of the epidemiology and control of this important but neglected human disease.",M2

17985889,"Beta-strand flipping and slipping triggered by turn replacement reveal the opportunistic nature of beta-strand pairing.We investigated how the register between adjacent beta-strands is specified using a series of mutants of the single-layer beta-sheet (SLB) in <e>Borrelia</e> OspA. The single-layer architecture of this system eliminates structural restraints imposed by a hydrophobic core, enabling us to address this question. A critical turn (turn 9/10) in the SLB was replaced with a segment with an intentional structural mismatch. Its crystal structure revealed a one-residue insertion into the central beta-strand (strand 9) of the SLB. This insertion triggered a surprisingly large-scale structural rearrangement: (i) the central strand (strand 9) was shifted by one residue, causing the strand to flip with respect to the adjacent beta-strands and thus completely disrupting the native side-chain contacts; (ii) the three-residue turn located on the opposite end of the beta-strand (turn 8/9) was pushed into its preceding beta-strand (strand 8); (iii) the register between strands 8 and 9 was shifted by three residues. Replacing the original sequence for turn 8/9 with a stronger turn motif restored the original strand register but still with a flipped beta-strand 9. The stability differences of these distinct structures were surprisingly small, consistent with an energy landscape where multiple low-energy states with different beta-sheet configurations exist. The observed conformations can be rationalized in terms of maximizing the number of backbone H-bonds. These results suggest that adjacent beta-strands  stick  through the use of factors that are not highly sequence specific and that beta-strands could slide back and forth relatively easily in the absence of external elements such as turns and tertiary packing.",M2

Symptoms associated with Lyme disease have been reported in Brazil, but no <e>Borrelia</e> sp. has been definitively related to these events. Here we have identified a B. lonestari/B. theileri-related spirochete DNA in the cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus from Brazil. Four hundred R. microplus and 80 Amblyomma cajennense ticks were screened, and only 1 horse-fed R. microplus was infected. A Borrelia sp. 16S rDNA sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the total tick DNA with 99% similarity to B. theileri and B. lonestari. Partial flaB sequence was also obtained, demonstrating 96% similarity to the B. lonestari flagellin gene, and the resultant putative amino acid sequence demonstrated 97% identity to B. lonestari flagellin. Moreover, partial glpQ sequence demonstrated 92% similarity to the B. lonestari gene, with a putative amino acid sequence 90% identical to the B. lonestari glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase. Phylogenetic analyses clearly include this Brazilian Borrelia sp., denoted  Borrelia,  sp-BR in a group of spirochetes aligned with B. theileri and B. lonestari.

Phylogenetic trees including Italian and reference sequences showed a clear separation of B. lusitaniae OspA strains in two different major clades. North African isolates form a clade with Portuguese POTIB strains, whereas Italian samples are grouped with German strains and a human Portuguese strain. This subdivision was supported by very high posterior probability values in the trees, by both analysis of molecular variance and selective pressure. These results, based on phylogenetic information contained in the OspA gene sequences, show the presence of two different B. lusitaniae strains circulating in the Mediterranean basin area, suggesting two different evolution paths.",M2
17767409,"Detection and identification of bacterial agents in Ixodes persulcatus Schulze ticks from the north western region of Russia.Ixodes persulcatus Schultze ticks are traditionally associated with transmission of Lyme disease, babesiosis, and tick-borne encephalitis. Here we compared the prevalence of infection with <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi, and rickettsial and ehrlichial agents in I. persulcatus ticks collected in different locations of the North Western administrative region of Russia. Altogether, 27.7% of ticks were infected with at least one organism, while the DNA of two or more bacteria was found in 11.8% of ticks tested. The highest average prevalence of Anaplasmataceae (20.8%) was detected in ticks from Arkhangel'sk province, while the prevalence in ticks from Novgorod province and St. Petersburg, respectively, was 7.3% and 12.2%. Only Ehrlichia muris DNA was identified by DNA sequencing. In comparison, the prevalence of B. burdorferi DNA was 16.6%, 5.8%, and 24.5% in the respective locations. The 382-bp amplicon of gltA from Candidatus Rickettsia tarasevichiae was detected in 2.75% and 1.6%, respectively, of ticks from Arkhangel'sk and Novgorod provinces, extending further west and north the area where this rickettsia is known to be present. DNA of the rickettsia-like endosymbiont Montezuma was primarily associated with female ticks, 8-28% of which were infected.

Antibodies to recombinant protein antigens originating from <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, or B. garinii species were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Of the 34 patients with NB, 100% of the CSF and 88% of the serum samples had IgG antibodies to 1 to 3 variants of DbpA and 79% of the CSF and 70% of the serum samples were positive for 1 to 3 DbpB variants. Antibodies to DbpB seemed to be associated with lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF and short duration of the disease, whereas antibodies to DbpA in the CSF were observed irrespective of the duration of the disease and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Among the variant antigens, CSF reactivity was mainly with the DbpB from B. garinii, whereas positivity with the DbpA from B. afzelii or B. garinii predominated. The results suggest that CSF antibodies to DbpB might be useful as a marker of active infection whereas antibodies to DbpA seem to persist a long time after acute phases of NB.",M2

Trapping sites were selected around sheep farms (study 1, 2000 to 2002) and recreational parks (study 2, 2003 to 2005). The majority of the studied mammals (162) were wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), but six other different species were also analyzed: yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis), shrews (Crocidura russula and Sorex coronatus), bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), domestic mice (Mus domesticus), and moles (Talpa europaea). The results showed an infection rate ranging from 10.7% to 68.8%, depending on the small mammal species. One C. russula shrew and one A. sylvaticus mouse gave positive reactions for A. phagocytophilum, and C. burnetii was detected in two domestic mice and one A. sylvaticus mouse in a farm. The DNA of Borrelia spp. was detected in 67 animals (26.5%), most of them presenting positive hybridization with the probe for Borrelia sp. strain R57, the new Borrelia species previously detected in small mammals in our region. Furthermore, a second PCR and reverse line blot hybridization specific for B. burgdorferi sensu lato revealed the presence of Borrelia afzelii in 6.3% of C. glareolus voles and 14.3% of S. coronatus shrews. All small mammals were negative for spotted fever group rickettsiae. These results highlight the relevance of small mammals as reservoirs of some zoonotic bacteria.",M2

We have expressed, purified, and characterized Ixodes scapularis salivary protein 20 (Salp20), a potential inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway that shares homology with the Isac protein family. When analysed by SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography, Salp20 was approximately 48 kDa, more than double its predicted mass, primarily due N- and O-linked glycosylations. Recombinant Salp20 inhibited the alternative complement pathway by dissociating the C3 convertase, and partially protected a serum sensitive species of Borrelia from lysis by normal human serum.

The hypothesis in this study was that wild lone star ticks from northeastern Georgia are capable of transmitting all three agents to white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, a known reservoir host for E. chaffeensis. In this study, transmission of all three agents from wild caught lone star ticks to captive reared white-tailed deer was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, or serology. Two of three deer showed evidence of E. chaffeensis and E. ewingii infection by polymerase chain reaction assay; all three deer showed evidence of B. lonestari by PCR assay. E. chaffeensis was isolated in culture from both PCR-positive deer on multiple days. All three deer seroconverted to E. chaffeensis, whereas one deer seroconverted to B. lonestari. This study supports the role of lone star ticks and white-tailed deer as a vector and reservoir host for E. chaffeensis and E. ewingii and suggests for the first time, transmission of B. lonestari from lone star ticks to white-tailed deer.",M2

Clinical findings were nonspecific; tick exposure was documented in 2 of the dogs. Hematologic abnormalities included anemia (n=2), neutrophilia (n=2, including 1 with a left shift), lymphopenia (n=3), eosinopenia (n=3), and thrombocytopenia (n=2). One anemic dog had a positive Coombs' test. In 1 dog, Western blot analysis of serum yielded multiple positive bands with B turicatae lysate, indicating the spirochetemia most likely was due to B turicatae infection. In 2 dogs, spirochetes were cultured from the blood and identified using DNA analysis as Borrelia turicatae; 1 of these dogs also was seropositive for Ehrlichia canis and B burgdorferi. In 2 cases, spirochetemia was more prominent in blood smears prepared immediately after sample collection than in smears prepared from EDTA blood. Two dogs recovered with doxycycline treatment; 1 dog declined clinically despite treatment and was euthanized. B turicatae is the agent of tick-borne (endemic) relapsing fever in humans and is distinct from B burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease; however, serologic cross-reactivity may occur. B turicatae is transmitted by the soft tick, Ornithodoros turicata, and infection should be considered in dogs with spirochetemia and possible exposure to the tick vector.",M2
17513779,"Dual binding specificity of a <e>Borrelia</e> hermsii-associated complement regulator-acquiring surface protein for factor H and plasminogen discloses a putative virulence factor of relapsing fever spirochetes.Tick-borne relapsing fever in North America is primarily caused by the spirochete Borrelia hermsii. The pathogen employs multiple strategies, including the acquisition of complement regulators and antigenic variation, to escape innate and humoral immunity. In this study we identified in B. hermsii a novel member of the complement regulator-acquiring surface protein (CRASP) family, designated BhCRASP-1, that binds the complement regulators factor H (FH) and FH-related protein 1 (FHR-1) but not FH-like protein 1 (FHL-1). BhCRASP-1 specifically interacts with the short consensus repeat 20 of FH, thereby maintaining FH-associated cofactor activity for factor I-mediated C3b inactivation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of BhCRASP- 1 converted the serum-sensitive Borrelia burgdorferi B313 strain into an intermediate complement-resistant strain. Finally, we report for the first time that BhCRASP-1 binds plasminogen/plasmin in addition to FH via, however, distinct nonoverlapping domains. The fact that surface-bound plasmin retains its proteolytic activity suggest that the dual binding specificity of BhCRASP-1 for FH and plasminogen/plasmin contributes to both the dissemination/invasion of B. hermsii and its resistance to innate immunity.",M2

The relapsing fever spirochetes contained six open reading frames that are absent from the B. burgdorferi genome. These genes included those for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hpt), adenylosuccinate synthase (purA), adenylosuccinate lyase (purB), auxiliary protein (nrdI), the ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase alpha subunit (nrdE), and the ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase beta subunit (nrdF). Southern blot assays with multiple Borrelia species and isolates confirmed the presence of these genes in the relapsing fever group of spirochetes but not in B. burgdorferi and related species. TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that the chromosomal genes (hpt, purA, and purB) were transcribed in vitro and in mice. Phosphoribosyltransferase assays revealed that, in general, B. hermsii exhibited significantly higher activity than did the B. burgdorferi cell lysate, and enzymatic activity was observed with adenine, hypoxanthine, and guanine as substrates. B. burgdorferi showed low but detectable phosphoribosyltransferase activity with hypoxanthine even though the genome lacks a discernible ortholog to the hpt gene in the relapsing fever spirochetes. B. hermsii incorporated radiolabeled hypoxanthine into RNA and DNA to a much greater extent than did B. burgdorferi. This complete pathway for purine salvage in the relapsing fever spirochetes may contribute, in part, to these spirochetes achieving high cell densities in blood.",M2

17471439,"Coinfection with <e>Borrelia</e> turicatae serotype 2 prevents the severe vestibular dysfunction and earlier mortality caused by serotype 1.BACKGROUND: Relapsing fever (RF) is a multisystemic spirochetal infection caused by different Borrelia species. Studies in our laboratory have shown that disease severity varies depending on the infecting serotype. However, the relative contribution of each serotype to pathogenesis during mixed infections is not known. To investigate this, we compared the outcome of infection with isogenic serotypes 1 (Bt1) or 2 (Bt2) of the RF agent B. turicatae alone or in combination. METHODS: B cell-deficient mice were used for these experiments, to avoid serotype clearance by the host's variable membrane protein-specific antibodies. Observers masked to infection status examined infected and uninfected control mice for clinical disease and functional impairment for up to 65 days. RESULTS: All mice developed persistent infection with the serotypes with which they were originally inoculated. Severe vestibular dysfunction developed in mice infected with Bt1 alone and was associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, coinfection with Bt2 significantly reduced the severity of vestibular dysfunction and prevented earlier mortality. In contrast, coinfection with Bt1 had little effect on the severe arthritis caused by Bt2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The manifestations of infection with B. turicatae are significantly influenced by the combination of serotypes present during mixed infection.",M2

Prevalence of infestation by larval Ixodes ricinus L. (Acari: Ixodidae) and mean numbers of larvae per host were not significantly different for common wall lizards, Podarcis muralis Laurenti, and Apodemus spp. mice, whereas infestation levels by nymphs were significantly greater on lizards. Borrelia lusitaniae, which was previously shown to be dominant in host-seeking I. ricinus in the same study area, was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 19.8% (95% confidence interval: 14.4, 26.0) of larval ticks and in 52.9% (27.8, 77.0) of nymphs that were collected from lizards. Moreover, 18.8% (7.2, 36.4) and 25.0 (3.2, 65.1) of lizards' tail biopsies and blood samples, respectively, were positive for B. lusitaniae. Conversely, attached ticks and ear biopsies from Apodemus spp. mice were PCR negative. Passerine birds belonging to 10 species were live captured in March 2005, and Borrelia valaisiana was detected in 57.1% (18.4, 90.1) of I. ricinus nymphs feeding on Eurasian blackbirds, Turdus merula L. Results of this study suggest that lizards play an important role as reservoirs for B. lusitanae and may affect the dominance of this genospecies in the Mediterranean area.",M2
17356382,"High production of CXCL13 in blood and brain during persistent infection with the relapsing fever spirochete <e>Borrelia</e> turicatae.Relapsing fever (RF) is a multisystemic borrelial infection with frequent neurologic involvement referred to as neuroborreliosis. The absence of an effective antibody response results in persistent infection. To study the consequences to the brain of persistent infection with the RF spirochete Borrelia turicatae, we studied B cell (Igh6-/-) and B and T (Rag1-/-) cell-deficient mice inoculated with isogenic serotypes 1 (Bt1) or 2 (Bt2). We found that Bt1 was more tissue tropic than Bt2, not only for brain but also for heart. Igh6-/- mice developed more severe clinical disease than Rag1-/- mice. Bt1-infected brains had widespread microgliosis/brain macrophage activation despite localization of spirochetes in the leptomeninges rather than the brain parenchyma itself. Oligoarray analysis revealed that CXCL13 was the most upregulated gene in the brain of Bt1-infected Igh6-/- mice. CXCL13 was also the most abundant of the chemokines we measured in infected blood. Persistent infection did not result in injury to the brain. Treatment with exogenous interleukin-10 reduced microgliosis in the brain and production of CXCL13 in the blood. We concluded that brain involvement in B cell-deficient mice persistently infected with B. turicatae is characterized by prominent microgliosis and production of CXCL13 without detectable injury.",M2
17339472,"MyD88- and Bruton's tyrosine kinase-mediated signals are essential for T cell-independent pathogen-specific IgM responses.Bacteremia is one of the leading causes of death by infectious disease. To understand the immune mechanisms required for the rapid control of bacteremia, we studied <e>Borrelia</e> hermsii, a bacterial pathogen that colonizes the blood stream of humans and rodents to an extremely high density. A T cell-independent IgM response is essential and sufficient for controlling B. hermsii bacteremia. Mice deficient in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), despite their known defect in BCR signaling, generated B. hermsii-specific IgM and resolved bacteremia, suggesting that an alternative activation or costimulatory pathway remained functional for T cell-independent B cells in Btk(-/-) mice. B. hermsii contains putative ligands for TLRs, and we found that mice deficient in TLR1, TLR2, or the TLR adaptor MyD88 generated anti-B. hermsii IgM with delayed kinetics and suffered more severe episodes of bacteremia. In striking contrast to the anti-B. hermsii IgM response in mice deficient only in Btk, mice deficient in both Btk and MyD88 were entirely incapable of generating B. hermsii-specific Ab or resolving bacteremia. The response to a T cell-dependent model Ag was unaffected in Btk(-/-) x MyD88(-/-) mice. These results suggest that MyD88 specifically promotes T cell-independent BCR signaling and that, in the absence of Btk, this TLR-mediated stimulation is a required component of this signal.",M2

We tested sera from 56 Eptesicus fuscus from Georgia against Borrelia hermsii, Orientia tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia conorii, and Rickettsia rickettsii. We detected antibodies reactive against a relapsing fever Borrelia and spotted fever group Rickettsia in 3/56 and 1/56 bats, respectively. We attempted to culture Bartonella from the blood of these bats but were unsuccessful. In addition, we fed bat ticks, Carios kelleyi, infected with Rickettsia on a specific pathogen-free guinea pig. The guinea pig had a weak seroconversion to R. rickettsii with a peak titer of 1:32 starting on day 14. Rickettsia was not detected in any of the tissue samples from the guinea pig by molecular means. Our results indicate that E. fuscus is naturally exposed to both a spotted fever group Rickettsia and a relapsing fever group Borrelia. If these agents are transmitted by bat ticks, then people living in close proximity to bat ticks might be exposed.",M2

The present study reports the first molecular characterization and in vitro isolation of an avian spirochaete strain from Brazil, presumably identified as B. anserina originated from naturally infected Argas miniatus ticks. DNA fragments of the rrs and flab genes were amplified by PCR and sequenced to determine phylogenetic similarities. The resulting sequences were 99.8% (483 of 484) and 98.7% (754 of 764) similar to GenBank corresponding sequences of B. anserina rrs and flaB genes, respectively. By neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis, the flaB sequence of the Brazilian strain clustered in a monophyletic group with the sequence of B. anserina under 100% bootstrap support. The isolate was successfully isolated in BSK medium, with seven passages performed. The spirochaete strain isolated in the present study was genetically identified as B. anserina labeled as strain PL.",M2
17200198,"Role of interleukin 10 during persistent infection with the relapsing fever Spirochete <e>Borrelia</e> turicatae.Relapsing fever is an infection characterized by peaks of spirochetemia attributable to antibody selection against variable serotypes. In the absence of B cells, serotypes cannot be cleared, resulting in persistent infection. We previously identified differences in spirochetemia and disease severity during persistent infection of severe combined immunodeficiency mice with isogenic serotypes 1 (Bt1) or 2 (Bt2) of Borrelia turicatae. To investigate this further, we studied pathogen load, clinical disease, cytokine/chemokine production, and inflammation in mice deficient in B (Igh6-/-) or B and T (Rag1-/-) cells persistently infected with Bt1 or Bt2. The results showed that Igh6-/- mice, despite lower spirochetemia, had a significantly aggravated disease course compared with Rag1-/- mice. Measurement of cytokines revealed a significant positive correlation between pathogen load and interleukin (IL)-10 in blood, brain, and heart. Bt2-infected Rag1-/- mice harbored the highest spirochetemia and, at the same time, displayed the highest IL-10 plasma levels. In the brain, Bt1, which was five times more neurotropic than Bt2, caused higher IL-10 production. Activated microglia were the main source of IL-10 in brain. IL-10 injected systemically reduced disease and spirochetemia. The results suggest IL-10 plays a protective role as a down-regulator of inflammation and pathogen load during infection with relapsing fever spirochetes.",M2

(Acari: Ixodidae) adults and nymphs to determine relative encounter frequencies and the infection prevalence of selected Borrelia spp. in their respective tick vectors. We also reviewed records of all ticks submitted for identification by the public in Monmouth County during 2001-2005. Relative abundance of the two species varied markedly among sites. Adult encounter frequencies for the two species were similar; however, A. americanum nymphs were encountered 3 times more frequently than I. scapularis nymphs. Of 435 ticks submitted by the public, 50.1 and 38.9% were I. scapularis and A. americanum, respectively. However, during May through August, the peak Lyme disease transmission season in New Jersey, significantly more submitted ticks were A. americanum (55.9%), compared with I. scapularis (34.1%). Polymerase chain reaction analysis of 94 1. scapularis and 103 A. americanum adults yielded infection prevalences of 31.9% for B. burgdorferi and 5.8% for B. lonestari, respectively. Although the infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi in I. scapularis was considerably higher than the infection prevalence of B. lonestari in A. americanum, the higher encounter frequencies for A. americanum compared with I. scapularis observed in this and other studies may result in increased risk of acquiring exposure to A. americanum-transmitted pathogens.

(Acari: Ixodidae) is an aggressive tick that feeds on humans during all postembryonic life stages. In many regions of the United States, it is the tick most commonly found attached to humans. Public health interest has grown recently, due to the recognition of new human pathogens transmitted by A. americanum and the expanding distribution of the tick. A. americanum is a vector of several bacteria pathogenic to humans. Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia ewingii cause moderate-to-severe febrile illness.  Rickettsia amblyommii,  a member of the spotted fever group Rickettsia, also has recently been implicated as a possible human pathogen based on serologic evidence from persons recovering from illness after a tick bite. We have determined the prevalence of infection of Ehrlichia chaffeensis, E. ewingii,  Borrelia lonestari , and R. amblyommii within A. americanum ticks from 29 sites in nine states. Overall infection prevalences were 4.7% for E. chaffeensis (range, 0-27%), 3.5% for E. ewingii (range, 0-18.6%), 2.5% for B. lonestari (range, 0-12.2%), and 41.2% for R. amblyommii (range, 0-84.0%). In addition, 87 ticks (4.3%) were infected with two or more bacteria. This report documents new distribution records for E. ewingii, B. lonestari, and R. amblyommii and underscores the nonhomogeneous distribution of pathogen foci of infection. Additional surveillance throughout the range ofA. americanum is warranted to increase physician and public awareness of the risk of disease to humans from exposure to the agents transmitted by this tick.",M2
17113237,"Alzheimer's disease Braak Stage progressions: reexamined and redefined as <e>Borrelia</e> infection transmission through neural circuits.Brain structure in health is a dynamic energized equation incorporating chemistry, neuronal structure, and circuitry components. The chemistry  piece  is represented by multiple neurotransmitters such as Acetylcholine, Serotonin, and Dopamine. The neuronal structure  piece  incorporates synapses and their connections. And finally circuits of neurons establish  architectural blueprints  of anatomic wiring diagrams of the higher order of brain neuron organizations. In Alzheimer's disease, there are progressive losses in all of these components. Brain structure crumbles. The deterioration in Alzheimer's is ordered, reproducible, and stepwise. Drs. Braak and Braak have described stages in the Alzheimer disease continuum.  Progressions  through Braak Stages benchmark  Regressions  in Cognitive function. Under the microscope, the Stages of Braak commence in brain regions near to the hippocampus, and over time, like a tsunami wave of destruction, overturn healthy brain regions, with neurofibrillary tangle damaged neurons  marching  through the temporal lobe, neocortex and occipital cortex. In effect the destruction ascends from the limbic regions to progressively destroy the higher brain centers. Rabies infection also  begins low and finishes high  in its wave of destruction of brain tissue. Herpes Zoster infections offer the paradigm of clinical latency of infection inside of nerves before the  marching commences . Varicella Zoster virus enters neurons in the pediatric years. Dormant virus remains inside the neurons for 50-80 years, tissue damage late in life (shingles) demonstrates the  march of the infection  down neural pathways (dermatomes) as linear areas of painful blisters loaded with virus from a childhood infection. Amalgamation of Zoster with Rabies models produces a hybrid model to explain all of the Braak Stages of Alzheimer's disease under a new paradigm, namely  Alzheimer's neuroborreliosis  in which latent Borrelia infections ascend neural circuits through the hippocampus to the higher brain centers, creating a trail of neurofibrillary tangle injured neurons in neural circuits of cholinergic neurons by transsynaptic transmission of infection from nerve to nerve.",M2

METHOD: A 38 year old married HIV positive woman presented with recurrent fever in a private clinic. Six thin smears were made out of the patient serum and dried in the air. Three slides each were stained with 0.12% Leishman and 20% Giemsa stains and examined under the light microscope. RESULT: Three of the Giemsa slides were positive for spirochetes (4-5 spirals), which were constituents with Borrelia species. The patient responded very well to tetracycline and serum became negative for the organism after ten days of treatment.

We demonstrate that B. duttonii infection during pregnancy results in intrauterine growth retardation, as well as placental damage and inflammation, impaired fetal circulation, and decreased maternal hemoglobin levels. We show that spirochetes frequently cross the maternal-fetal barrier, resulting in congenital infection. Furthermore, we compared the severity of infection in pregnant and nonpregnant mice and show that pregnancy has a protective effect. This model closely parallels the consequences of human gestational infection, and our results provide insight into the mechanisms behind the complications of pregnancy that have been reported in human relapsing-fever infection.",M2
17049082,"Use of CFSE staining of borreliae in studies on the interaction between borreliae and human neutrophils.BACKGROUND: Species of the tick-transmitted spirochete group <e>Borrelia</e> burgdorferi sensu lato (B. burgdorferi) cause Lyme borreliosis. Acute borrelial infection of the skin has unusual characteristics with only a mild local inflammatory response suggesting that the interaction between borreliae and the cells of the first-line defence might differ from that of other bacteria. It has been reported that human neutrophils phagocytose motile borreliae through an unconventional mechanism (tube phagocytosis) which is not observed with non-motile borreliae. Therefore, it would be of great interest to visualise the bacteria by a method not affecting motility and viability of borreliae to be able to study their interaction with the cells of the innate immunity. Carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labelling has been previously used for studying the adhesion of labelled bacteria to host cells and the uptake of labelled substrates by various cells using flow cytometry. RESULTS: In this study, CFSE was shown to efficiently stain different genospecies of B. burgdorferi without affecting bacterial viability or motility. Use of CFSE staining allowed subsequent quantification of borreliae associated with human neutrophils with flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. As a result, no difference in association between different borrelial genospecies (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii), or between borreliae and the pyogenic bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes, with neutrophils could be detected. Borrelial virulence, on the other hand, affected association with neutrophils, with significantly higher association of a non-virulent mutant B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain compared to the parental virulent wild type strain. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the flow cytometric assay using CFSE labelled borreliae is a valuable tool in the analysis of the interaction between borreliae and human neutrophils. The results also indicate a clear difference in the association with neutrophils between virulent and non-virulent borrelial strains.",M2
17030581,"Dual role of MyD88 in rapid clearance of relapsing fever <e>Borrelia</e> spp.Relapsing fever Borrelia spp. undergo antigenic variation, achieve high levels in blood, and require rapid production of immunoglobulin M (IgM) for clearance. MyD88-deficient mice display defective clearance of many pathogens; however, the IgM response to persistent infection is essentially normal. Therefore, MyD88(-/-) mice provided a unique opportunity to study the effect of nonantibody, innate host defenses to relapsing fever Borrelia. Infected MyD88(-/-) mice harbored extremely high levels of B. hermsii in the blood compared to wild-type littermates. In the comparison of MyD88(-/-) mice and B- and T-cell-deficient scid mice, two features stood out: (i) bacterial numbers in blood were at least 10-fold greater in MyD88(-/-) mice than scid mice, even though the production of IgM still occurred in MyD88(-/-) mice; and (ii) many of the MyD88(-/-) mice were able to exert partial clearance, although with delayed kinetics relative to wild-type mice, a feature not seen in scid mice. Further analysis revealed a delay in the IgM response to lipoproteins expressed by the original inoculum; however, by 6 days of infection antibodies were produced in MyD88(-/-) mice that could clear spirochetemia in scid mice. While these results indicated that the production of IgM was delayed in MyD88(-/-) mice, they also point to a second, antibody-independent role for MyD88 signaling in host defense to relapsing fever Borrelia. This second defect was apparent only when antibody levels were limiting.",M2

Tick densities were calculated, and infection with Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species was investigated by reverse line blot analysis. The lowest tick density was observed in the heather area (1 to 8/100 m2). In the oak forest and city park, the tick densities ranged from 26 to 45/100 m2. The highest tick density was found in the dune area (139 to 551/100 m2). The infection rates varied significantly for the four study areas and years, ranging from 0.8 to 11. 5% for Borrelia spp. and 1 to 16% for Ehrlichia or Anaplasma (Ehrlichia/Anaplasma) spp. Borrelia infection rates were highest in the dunes, followed by the forest, the city park, and heather area. In contrast, Ehrlichia/Anaplasma was found most often in the forest and less often in the city park. The following Borrelia species were found: Borrelia sensu lato strains not identified to the species level (2.5%), B. afzelii (2.5%), B. valaisiana (0.9%), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (0.13%), and B. garinii (0.13%). For Ehrlichia/Anaplasma species, Ehrlichia and Anaplasma spp. not identified to the species level (2.5%), Anaplasma schotti variant (3.5%), Anaplasma phagocytophilum variant (0.3%), and Ehrlichia canis (0.19%) were found. E. canis is reported for the first time in ticks in The Netherlands in this study. Borrelia lusitaniae, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and the human granylocytic anaplasmosis agent were not detected. About 1.6% of the ticks were infected with both Borrelia and Ehrlichia/Anaplasma, which was higher than the frequency predicted from the individual infection rates, suggesting hosts with multiple infections or a possible selective advantage of coinfection.",M2

17055667,"Alzheimer's neuroborreliosis with trans-synaptic spread of infection and neurofibrillary tangles derived from intraneuronal spirochetes.In the realm of dementia, it is astonishing to note that neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are microscopically identical in a childhood illness (SSPE) and in a dementia of late adult life (Alzheimer's disease). The words  Alzheimer-type  NFT in peer reviewed scientific articles written by acknowledged experts underscore the striking similarities in  tangles  in two different diseases. Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) is caused by infection with atypical measles virus. Alzheimer's disease has no known cause. There is little controversy in suggesting that all of the Tangles in SSPE infected neurons are produced by slow viral type variant of Measles infection. But the mere suggestion that infection might be a cause of Alzheimer's disease confounds the establishment. If a good case is to be made for infection in Alzheimer's disease, an excellent nerve cell infection model is needed. Monkeys have provided a very reasonable model. Recently, a primate neuroborreliosis brain infection model demonstrated that <e>Borrelia</e> injected into the skin of monkeys resulted in the appearance of Borrelia transcriptomes in brain neurons. If Borrelia can travel from skin to brain in the monkey, then why not look at human Alzheimer's tissues to see if the DNA of Borrelia is present in the human brain? The molecular detection tools perfected in animal neuroborreliosis studies have been applied to human Alzheimer's disease brain tissues. Seven of ten cases of Alzheimer's disease from McLean Hospital Brain Bank of Harvard University yielded positive signals for infectious DNA in a small pilot study. Alzheimer's diseased neurons analyzed with DNA probes, produced little  dots  of positive staining. Granulovacuolar bodies in Alzheimer's diseased neurons (little dots in a bubble), are one of the expected microscopic profiles of Alzheimer's disease.  Little dots  inside nerve cells are also signatures of viral infectious agents inside of nerve cells. So with the assistance of the microscope and the tools of molecular biology, a new model of infection emerges as a cause of  Alzheimer's-type  neurofibrillary tangles. Here I hypothesize that it is chronic infection of human neurons in Alzheimer's disease that produces neurofibrillary tangles by a pathway similar to the chronic SSPE infection tangle pathway. In addition, transmission of infection from nerve to nerve is proposed to explain the evolution of Alzheimer's disease. Herein is offered a new view for the origins and for the progression of diseased nerves with tangle formations in Alzheimer's disease based on infection.",M2
