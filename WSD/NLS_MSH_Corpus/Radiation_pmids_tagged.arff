20445395,"<e>Radiation</e> combined injury: overview of NIAID research.The term  radiation combined injury  (RCI) is used to describe conditions where radiation injury is coupled with other insults such as burns, wounds, infection, or blunt trauma. A retrospective account of injuries sustained following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima estimates that RCI comprised approximately 65% of all injuries observed. Much of the research that has been performed on RCI was carried out during the Cold War and our understanding of the clinical problem RCI presents does not reflect the latest advances in medicine or science. Because concerns have increased that terrorists might employ radiological or nuclear weapons, and because of the likelihood that victims of such terrorism would experience RCI, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health sponsored a meeting in 2007 to explore the state of the research in this area, identify programmatic gaps, and establish priorities for future research. As a follow-up to that meeting, in 2008 NIAID sponsored an initiative on RCI, leading to the award of several exploratory/developmental grants, the goals of which are to better understand biological synergy involved in RCI-induced damage, develop improved animal models for various type of RCI, and advance identification and testing of potential countermeasures to treat injuries that would be expected following a radiological or nuclear event. This program has already yielded new insight into the nature of combined injuries and has identified a number of novel and existing compounds that may be effective treatments for this condition.",M1
20445382,"Some considerations for mass casualty management in <e>radiation</e> emergencies.Radiation emergencies are rather new to humankind, as compared to other types of emergencies such as earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes. Fortunately, they are rare, but because of that, planning for response to large-scale radiation emergencies is least understood. Along with the specific technical aspects of response to radiation emergencies, there are some general guiding principles of responding to mass casualty events of any nature, as identified by the World Health Organization in its 2007 manual for mass casualty management systems. The paper brings forward such general considerations as applicable to radiation mass casualty events, including (1) clear lines of communication; (2) scalability of approach; (3) whole-of-health approach; (4) knowledge based approach; and (5) multisectoral approach. Additionally, some key considerations of planning for mass casualty management systems are discussed, namely, health systems surge capacity and networking, risk and resources mapping, and others.",M1

According to its statutory role, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is in charge of medical preparedness and response for radiological and nuclear emergencies. Chinese Center for Medical Response to Radiation Emergency (CCMRRE), led by Office of Health Emergency, MOH, is responsible for organizing and conducting national medical assistance and response to radiation accidents and providing technical instruction and support for seven Olympic cities. To fulfill its responsibilities, CCMRRE has carried out a series of preparedness trainings and exercises. The aim of this report is to introduce the work of strengthening radiation emergency preparedness and share the experience obtained while preparing and organizing the 2008 Olympic Games in China.",M1
20445378,"WHO-REMPAN for global health security and strengthening preparedness and response to <e>radiation</e> emergencies.In response to the changing global environment and emerging new issues related to health security, the World Health Organization (WHO) is putting in place new tools for collective defense, such as the revised International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005). The new framework puts additional responsibilities on both Member States and WHO itself in order to effectively implement the IHR (2005) and react effectively in case of public health emergency events of any nature. Since its establishment in 1987, the Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance Network of WHO (WHO-REMPAN) has become an important asset for the organization's capacity to respond to radiation emergencies and to assist its Member States to strengthen their own response capacities. The paper describes in detail the framework for the WHO's role in preparedness and response to radiation emergencies, including Emergency Conventions and IHR (2005), and how the WHO-REMPAN, through its activities (i.e., technical guidelines development, training, education, research, and information sharing), provides a significant contribution to the organization's program of work towards achievement of the global health security goal.",M1

20439762,"Design strategies to minimize the radiative efficiency of global warming molecules.A strategy is devised to screen molecules based on their radiative efficiency. The methodology should be useful as one additional constraint when determining the best molecule to use for an industrial application. The strategy is based on the results of a recent study where we examined molecular properties of global warming molecules using ab initio electronic structure methods to determine which fundamental molecular properties are important in assessing the radiative efficiency of a molecule. Six classes of perfluorinated compounds are investigated. For similar numbers of fluorine atoms, their absorption of <e>radiation</e> in the IR window decreases according to perfluoroethers &gt; perfluorothioethers approximately sulfur/carbon compounds &gt; perfluorocarbons &gt; perfluoroolefins &gt; carbon/nitrogen compounds. Perfluoroethers and hydrofluorethers are shown to possess a large absorption in the IR window due to (i) the C horizontal line O bonds are very polar, (ii) the C-O stretches fall within the IR window and have large IR intensity due to their polarity, and (iii) the IR intensity for C-F stretches in which the fluorine atom is bonded to the carbon that is bonded to the oxygen atom is enhanced due to a larger C horizontal line F bond polarity. Lengthening the carbon chain leads to a larger overall absorption in the IR window, though the IR intensity per bond is smaller. Finally, for a class of partially fluorinated compounds with a set number of electronegative atoms, the overall absorption in the IR window can vary significantly, as much as a factor of 2, depending on how the fluorine atoms are distributed within the molecule.",M1
20371905,"Evaluation of a <e>radiation</e> transport modeling method for radioactive bone cement.Spinal metastases are a common and serious manifestation of cancer, and are often treated with vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty followed by external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). As an alternative, we have introduced radioactive bone cement, i.e. bone cement incorporated with a radionuclide. In this study, we present a Monte Carlo radiation transport modeling method to calculate dose distributions within vertebrae containing radioactive cement. Model accuracy was evaluated by comparing model-predicted depth-dose curves to those measured experimentally in eight cadaveric vertebrae using radiochromic film. The high-gradient regions of the depth-dose curves differed by radial distances of 0.3-0.9 mm, an improvement over EBRT dosimetry accuracy. The low-gradient regions differed by 0.033-0.055 Gy/h/mCi, which may be important in situations involving prior spinal cord irradiation. Using a more rigorous evaluation of model accuracy, four models predicted the measured dose distribution within the experimental uncertainty, as represented by the 95% confidence interval of the measured log-linear depth-dose curve. The remaining four models required modification to account for marrow lost from the vertebrae during specimen preparation. However, the accuracy of the modified model results indicated that, when this source of uncertainty is accounted for, this modeling method can be used to predict dose distributions in vertebrae containing radioactive cement.",M1
20368255,"A new one-dimensional radiative equilibrium model for investigating atmospheric <e>radiation</e> entropy flux.A new one-dimensional radiative equilibrium model is built to analytically evaluate the vertical profile of the Earth's atmospheric radiation entropy flux under the assumption that atmospheric longwave radiation emission behaves as a greybody and shortwave radiation as a diluted blackbody. Results show that both the atmospheric shortwave and net longwave radiation entropy fluxes increase with altitude, and the latter is about one order in magnitude greater than the former. The vertical profile of the atmospheric net radiation entropy flux follows approximately that of the atmospheric net longwave radiation entropy flux. Sensitivity study further reveals that a 'darker' atmosphere with a larger overall atmospheric longwave optical depth exhibits a smaller net radiation entropy flux at all altitudes, suggesting an intrinsic connection between the atmospheric net radiation entropy flux and the overall atmospheric longwave optical depth. These results indicate that the overall strength of the atmospheric irreversible processes at all altitudes as determined by the corresponding atmospheric net entropy flux is closely related to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.",M1
20308083,"Response to  <e>Radiation</e> therapeutic gain and Asian botanicals,  by Stephen Sagar.Numerous botanical agents, many of which are used in whole medical system practices (i.e. traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, etc.), have been shown to exhibit radiomodifying effects on tumors and normal tissues in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Some of these agents can enhance the therapeutic gain of radiation therapy by either acting as a radiosensitizer to tumor cells and/or as a radioprotector to normal cells. Botanical agents are comprised of multiple phytochemical compounds that may work individually or synergistically to not only improve radiation therapy outcomes, but may also exhibit a variety of anti-cancer effects as well. It will be important to evaluate these botanicals for efficacy, tumor specificity, and safety profiles before they can be recommended during radiation therapy.",M1
20307182,"Geophysical and atmospheric evolution of habitable planets.The evolution of Earth-like habitable planets is a complex process that depends on the geodynamical and geophysical environments. In particular, it is necessary that plate tectonics remain active over billions of years. These geophysically active environments are strongly coupled to a planet's host star parameters, such as mass, luminosity and activity, orbit location of the habitable zone, and the planet's initial water inventory. Depending on the host star's <e>radiation</e> and particle flux evolution, the composition in the thermosphere, and the availability of an active magnetic dynamo, the atmospheres of Earth-like planets within their habitable zones are differently affected due to thermal and nonthermal escape processes. For some planets, strong atmospheric escape could even effect the stability of the atmosphere.",M1
20225848,"Effect of <e>radiation</e>-induced amorphization on smectite dissolution.Effects of radiation-induced amorphization of smectite were investigated using artificial irradiation. Beams of 925 MeV Xenon ions with radiation dose reaching 73 MGy were used to simulate the effects generated by alpha recoil nuclei or fission products in the context of high level nuclear waste repository. Amorphization was controlled by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. An important coalescence of the smectite sheets was observed which lead to a loss of interparticle porosity. The amorphization is revealed by a loss of long-range structure and accompanied by dehydroxylation. The dissolution rate far-from-equilibrium shows that the amount of silica in solution is two times larger in the amorphous sample than in the reference clay, a value which may be enhanced by orders of magnitude when considering the relative surface area of the samples. Irradiation-induced amorphization thus facilitates dissolution of the clay-derived material. This has to be taken into account for the safety assessment of high level nuclear waste repository, particularly in a scenario of leakage of the waste package which would deliver alpha emitters able to amorphize smectite after a limited period of time.",M1
20213160,"Extended high circular polarization in the Orion massive star forming region: implications for the origin of homochirality in the solar system.We present a wide-field (approximately 6' x 6') and deep near-infrared (K(s) band: 2.14 mum) circular polarization image in the Orion nebula, where massive stars and many low-mass stars are forming. Our results reveal that a high circular polarization region is spatially extended (approximately 0.4 pc) around the massive star-forming region, the BN/KL nebula. However, other regions, including the linearly polarized Orion bar, show no significant circular polarization. Most of the low-mass young stars do not show detectable extended structure in either linear or circular polarization, in contrast to the BN/KL nebula. If our solar system formed in a massive star-forming region and was irradiated by net circularly polarized <e>radiation</e>, then enantiomeric excesses could have been induced, through asymmetric photochemistry, in the parent bodies of the meteorites and subsequently delivered to Earth. These could then have played a role in the development of biological homochirality on Earth.",M1

Extensive N,O-H...O hydrogen bonding utilizing all water H atoms, including four waters of crystallization, provides crystal packing. The structural definition of this novel compound was made possible through the use of synchrotron radiation utilizing a minute fragment (volume approximately 2.4 x 10(-5) mm(-3)) on a beamline optimized for protein data collection. A summary of intra-ring conformations for immucillin structures indicates considerable flexibility while retaining similar intra-ring orientations.",M1

20071754,"<e>Radiation</e> induced currents in MRI RF coils: application to linac/MRI integration.The integration of medical linear accelerators (linac) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems is advancing the current state of image-guided radiotherapy. The MRI in these integrated units will provide real-time, accurate tumor locations for radiotherapy treatment, thus decreasing geometric margins around tumors and reducing normal tissue damage. In the real-time operation of these integrated systems, the radiofrequency (RF) coils of MRI will be irradiated with radiation pulses from the linac. The effect of pulsed radiation on MRI radio frequency (RF) coils is not known and must be studied. The instantaneous radiation induced current (RIC) in two different MRI RF coils were measured and presented. The frequency spectra of the induced currents were calculated. Some basic characterization of the RIC was also done: isolation of the RF coil component responsible for RIC, dependence of RIC on dose rate, and effect of wax buildup placed on coil on RIC. Both the time and frequency characteristics of the RIC were seen to vary with the MRI RF coil used. The copper windings of the RF coils were isolated as the main source of RIC. A linear dependence on dose rate was seen. The RIC was decreased with wax buildup, suggesting an electronic disequilibrium as the cause of RIC. This study shows a measurable RIC present in MRI RF coils. This unwanted current could be possibly detrimental to the signal to noise ratio in MRI and produce image artifacts.",M1
20023328,"Cerenkov <e>radiation</e> allows in vivo optical imaging of positron emitting radiotracers.In this paper, we showed that Cerenkov radiation (CR) escaping from the surface of small living animals injected with (18)F-FDG can be detected with optical imaging techniques. (18)F decays by emitting positrons with a maximum energy of 0.635 MeV; such positrons, when travelling into tissues faster than the speed of light in the same medium, are responsible of CR emission. A detailed model of the CR spectrum considering the positron energy spectrum was developed in order to quantify the amount of light emission. The results presented in this work were obtained using a commercial optical imager equipped with charged coupled detectors (CCD). Our data open the door to optical imaging (OI) in vivo of the glucose metabolism, at least in pre-clinical research. We found that the heart and bladder can be clearly identified in the animal body reflecting the accumulation of the (18)F-FDG. Moreover, we describe two different methods based on the spectral analysis of the CR that can be used to estimate the depth of the source inside the animal. We conclude that (18)F-FDG can be employed as it is as a bimodal tracer for positron emission tomography (PET) and OI techniques. Our results are encouraging, suggesting that it could be possible to apply the proposed approach not only to beta(+) but also to pure beta(-) emitters.",M1
19996508,"[Influence of electromagnetic <e>radiation</e> on toxicity of Vipera lebetina obtusa venom]The aim of the article was to study the effect of electromagnetic radiation on toxicity of Vipera lebetina obtusa venom. It was found that mice intoxicated with snake venom, with moderate to high exposure to electromagnetic radiation and mice intoxicated with venom, which had not been exposed to the radiation showed the same symptoms of intoxication and death. At the same time, the longevity of mice intoxicated with venom exposed to electromagnetic radiation was higher. The longevity of mice in control group was 25+/-5 min. The longevity of mice intoxicated with exposed to electromagnetic radiation snake venom was from 29 to 60 min. The research showed that the longevity of mice intoxicated with snake venom rose with the level of electromagnetic radiation intensity the snake was exposed to. Accordingly, snake venom, with exposure to high intensity electromagnetic radiation is less toxic.",M1
19968355,"<e>Radiation</e> damage in biomimetic dye molecules for solar cells.A significant obstacle to organic photovoltaics is radiation damage, either directly by photochemical reactions or indirectly via hot electrons. Such effects are investigated for biomimetic dye molecules for solar cells (phthalocyanines) and for a biological analog (the charge transfer protein cytochrome c). Both feature a central transition metal atom (or H(2)) surrounded by nitrogen atoms. Soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy are used to identify three types of radiation-induced changes in the electronic structure of these molecules. (1) The peptide bonds along the backbone of the protein are readily broken, while the nitrogen cage remains rather stable in phthalocyanines. This finding suggests minimizing peptide attachments to biologically inspired molecules for photovoltaic applications. (2) The metal atom in the protein changes its 3d electron configuration under irradiation. (3) The Fermi level E(F) shifts relative to the band gap in phthalocyanine films due to radiation-induced gap states. This effect has little influence on the optical absorption, but it changes the lineup between the energy levels of the absorbing dye and the acceptor/donor electrodes that collect the charge carriers in a solar cell.",M1
19960068,"Effects of computer monitor-emitted <e>radiation</e> on oxidant/antioxidant balance in cornea and lens from rats.PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the possible effects of computer monitor-emitted radiation on the oxidant/antioxidant balance in corneal and lens tissues and to observe any protective effects of vitamin C (vit C). METHODS: Four groups (PC monitor, PC monitor plus vitamin C, vitamin C, and control) each consisting of ten Wistar rats were studied. The study lasted for three weeks. Vitamin C was administered in oral doses of 250 mg/kg/day. The computer and computer plus vitamin C groups were exposed to computer monitors while the other groups were not. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) activities were measured in corneal and lens tissues of the rats. RESULTS: In corneal tissue, MDA levels and CAT activity were found to increase in the computer group compared with the control group. In the computer plus vitamin C group, MDA level, SOD, and GSH-Px activities were higher and CAT activity lower than those in the computer and control groups. Regarding lens tissue, in the computer group, MDA levels and GSH-Px activity were found to increase, as compared to the control and computer plus vitamin C groups, and SOD activity was higher than that of the control group. In the computer plus vitamin C group, SOD activity was found to be higher and CAT activity to be lower than those in the control group. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that computer-monitor radiation leads to oxidative stress in the corneal and lens tissues, and that vitamin C may prevent oxidative effects in the lens.",M1
19812920,"<e>Radiation</e> exposure prior to ischemia decreases lesion volume, brain edema and cell death.PURPOSE: To investigate the neuronal response to ischemic injury following exposure to whole brain proton irradiation. METHODS: Brain only proton irradiation (8 Gy, 250 MeV) was performed ten days prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in 1 year old male Sprague Dawley rats. MCAO was induced in two animal groups: proton irradiated (MCAO + Rad) and MCAO only. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitative analysis were performed prior to and 2 days after irradiation, and then 2, 14 and 28 days after MCAO. After the last imaging time point animals were sacrificed and TUNEL staining was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde - fixed brain sections. RESULTS: Neuroimaging demonstrated a reduction in ischemic lesion volume in the MCAO + Rad group compared with MCAO alone. Neurological deficits did not differ between ischemia groups. Interestingly, there was a 34% decrease in the number of TUNEL-positive cells in MCAO + Rad brains compared to MCAO alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that radiation treatment reduces brain edema, ischemic lesion volume and peri-ischemic apoptosis. The underlying mechanisms are currently unknown and additional studies will elucidate the significance of these results.",M1
19956898,"Scriptaid, a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhances the response of human tumor cells to <e>radiation</e>.A group of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors has been shown to suppress the growth of a variety of human tumor lines in vitro and in vivo and they are among the most promising candidates for anti-cancer therapeutic agents. We investigated the ability of scriptaid, a novel HDAC inhibitor and trichostatin A (TSA) to enhance cell killing by radiation in radioresistant SQ-20B cells derived from human head and neck squamous carcinoma. SQ-20B cells were treated with scriptaid or TSA in combination with radiation. Cell survival was determined by a colony formation assay and protein levels were examined by Western blotting. DNA double strand breaks were measured by a gamma-H2AX focus assay. Radiosensitization was observed for SQ-20B cells incubated with scriptaid at 5 microM or TSA at 0.1 microM for 24 h. Radiosensitization by scriptaid was accompanied by a prolonged retention of gamma-H2AX foci, suggesting that the enhancement of radiation cell killing by scriptaid involved inhibition of DNA double strand break repair. In addition, treatment with scriptaid suppressed expression of Ku80, but not Ku70. Scriptaid may be a useful radiosensitizer in the treatment of radioresistant human carcinomas.",M1
19938952,"The mobile phone decreases fructose but not citrate in rabbit semen: a longitudinal study.The negative impact of mobile phones on sperm motility has been previously described. Both fructose and citrate are important components in semen that facilitate sperm motility. To date, no studies have investigated the effect of exposure to electromagnetic <e>radiation</e> emitted from the mobile phone on their levels.. Therefore, a longitudinal study using the adult rabbit as a model was undertaken. A total of 30 adult male rabbits were randomly divided into three groups. The first (phone) group was placed in specially designed cages, and exposed to radio frequency emitted from a mobile phone (900 MHz) kept in standby mode and positioned adjacent to the genitalia for 8 h daily for 12 weeks. The other two groups served as controls; the stress group which was housed in the same kind of cages to evaluate any cage-induced anxiety, and the control group which was housed in the conventional roomy cages. Semen samples were retrieved weekly. Sperm motility and viability, semen fructose and citrate, and serum testosterone were measured. Histological sections from the prostatic complex, ampulla, and vesicular gland were evaluated. A significant drop in both fructose levels (257 +/-11.6 vs. 489 +/- 8.4 mg %, the baseline level) and number of motile sperms (50 vs. 72%) was observedin the phone group at the 10th week. However, no correlation was found between the two values. The stress control animals showed a similar but significantly less decline in motility No significant changes in citrate levels or other study parameters were seen in the three animal groups throughout the study. In conclusion, the pulsed radio frequency emitted by the mobile phone kept in the standby position longitudinally affected sperm motility and fructose but not citrate levels in rabbit semen.",M1
19937757,"Synchrotron <e>radiation</e> circular dichroism of various G-quadruplex structures.Here we report synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectra of various G-quadruplexes from 179 to 350 nm, and a number of bands in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) are reported for the first time. For a tetramolecular parallel structure, the strongest band in the spectrum is a negative band in the VUV at 182 nm; for a bimolecular antiparallel structure with diagonal loops, a new strong positive band is found at 190 nm; for a bimolecular parallel structure with edgewise loops, a strong positive band at 189 nm is observed; and for a self-folded chair-type structure, the strongest band in the spectrum is a positive band at 187 nm. For the tetramolecular parallel structure, the CD signals at all wavelengths are dominated by contributions from quartets of G bases, and the signal strength is approximately proportional to the number of quartets. Our experiments on well-characterized G-quadruplex structures lead us to question past attributions of CD signals to helix handedness and G quartet polarity. Although differences can be observed in the VUV region for the various quadruplex types, there do not appear to be clear-cut spectral features that can be used to identify specific topological features. It is suggested that this is because a dominant positive band in the VUV seen near 190 nm in all quadruplex structures is due to intrastrand guanine-guanine base stacking. However, our spectra can serve as reference spectra for the G-quadruplex structures investigated and, not least, to benchmark theoretical calculations and empirical models.",M1

19903530,"<e>Radiation</e> damage effects at four specimen temperatures from 4 to 100 K.Radiation damage is the primary factor that limits resolution in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) of frozen-hydrated biological samples. Negative effects of radiation damage are attenuated by cooling specimens to cryogenic temperatures using liquid nitrogen or liquid helium. We have examined the relationship between specimen temperature and radiation damage across a broad spectrum of resolution by analyzing images of frozen-hydrated catalase crystal at four specimen temperatures: 4, 25, 42, and 100K. For each temperature,  exposure series  were collected consisting of consecutive images of the same area of sample, each with 10 e(-)/A(2) exposure per image. Radiation damage effects were evaluated by examining the correlation between cumulative exposure and normalized amplitudes or IQ values of Bragg peaks across a broad range of resolution (4.0-173.5A). Results indicate that for sub-nanometer resolution, liquid nitrogen specimen temperature (100K) provides the most consistent high-quality data while yielding statistically equivalent protection from radiation damage compared to the three lower temperatures. At lower resolution, suitable for tomography, intermediate temperatures (25 or 42K) may provide a modest improvement in cryo-protection without introducing deleterious effects evident at 4 K.",M1
19849853,"Pathophysiology of cell phone <e>radiation</e>: oxidative stress and carcinogenesis with focus on male reproductive system.Hazardous health effects stemming from exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic waves (RF-EMW) emitted from cell phones have been reported in the literature.

In addition, the effects of RF-EMW on plasma membrane structures (i.e. NADH oxidase, phosphatidylserine, ornithine decarboxylase) and voltage-gated calcium channels are discussed. We explore the disturbance in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism caused by RF-EMW and delineate NADH oxidase mediated ROS formation as playing a central role in oxidative stress (OS) due to cell phone radiation (with a focus on the male reproductive system). This review also addresses: 1) the controversial effects of RF-EMW on mammalian cells and sperm DNA as well as its effect on apoptosis, 2) epidemiological, in vivo animal and in vitro studies on the effect of RF-EMW on male reproductive system, and 3) finally, exposure assessment and dosimetry by computational biomodeling.",M1
19831840,"<e>Radiation</e>-induced gliomas.Radiation-induced gliomas represent a relatively rare but an extensively published entity in the neuro-oncologic literature. Extensive retrospective cohort data in pediatric populations after therapeutic intracranial radiation show an increased risk in glioma incidence that is both patient age- and radiation dose/volume-dependent. Data in adults are more limited but show heightened risk in certain groups exposed to radiation. In both populations, there is no statistically increased risk associated with routine exposure to diagnostic radiation. At the molecular level, there are conflicting data concerning whether distinct genetic differences between radiation-induced gliomas and their spontaneously occurring counterparts exist. Clinically, there is understandable reluctance on the part of clinicians to re-treat patients owing to concern for cumulative neurotoxicity. However, available data suggest that aggressive intervention can lead to improved outcomes in patients with radiation-induced gliomas.",M1

This paper focuses on beliefs about radiation and the implications of those beliefs for views about radiation protection by both scientists and members of the U.S. public. We use data from a large sample of scientists, collected in 2002, and a series of surveys of the U.S. public collected in 2007. Among scientists, we focus on how beliefs about radiation are related to policy prescriptions for radiation protection. Among members of the lay public the focus shifts to the relationship between beliefs about radiation risks and policy preferences for nuclear energy and nuclear waste policy options. The importance of the differences and similarities in the patterns of beliefs of scientists and the lay public are discussed.",M1

As far as the underwater suspended Enteromorpha prolifera is concerned, the present paper carried out the radiative transfer simulation research on the above water spectral response, its variation with the suspending depth, the water turbidity and environmental conditions. It was found that with the increase in Enteromorpha prolifera suspending depth and water turbidity as well as the decrease in the thickness of Enteromorpha prolifera, the Enteromorpha prolifera information contained in the surface spectra would decrease. The influence of environmental factors such as water-gas interface roughness, cloud cover extent and sun zenith angle on the underwater suspended Enteromorpha prolifera spectra can be ignored. The maximum Enteromorpha prolifera depth that can cause surface spectrum changes is about 30 m in clean water and about 1 m in turbidity water.",M1

Simulations and treatments were performed in the supine position in almost all patients. Immobilization devices were used in only 15% of the patients. Verification of the treatment fields using portal films or electric portal imaging devices was performed in most of the patients. However, regular or multiple verifications in addition to initial treatment and/or portal volume changes were performed in only 30% of the patients. Typical beam arrangements for treatment of the prostate consisted of a four-field box. Three-dimensional conformal techniques were applied less frequently in non-academic hospitals than in academic ones. Modernized multileaf collimators with leaf widths &lt; or =10 mm were used in about two-thirds of the patients. Although the total doses given to the prostate were affected by the leaf widths, there were no significant differences between leaf widths of 5 and 10 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the survey identified certain patterns in the current treatment planning and delivery processes for localized prostate cancer in Japan.",M1
19786752,"Risk of <e>radiation</e> and choice of imaging.Radiological imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The barium or contrast techniques enteroclysis (SBE) and small bowel follow through (SBFT) are still the mainstays in small bowel imaging. However, abdominal CT and MRI, including enteroclysis, have comparable sensitivity and specificity in detecting intestinal pathologies and have gained in popularity over conventional techniques. The cancer risk associated with diagnostic procedures employing radiation has been receiving increasing attention over the last few years. The cumulative exposure to ionizing radiation may be a specific concern in young patients with IBD, who are more susceptible than adults to the risks of ionizing radiation. Substantial exposure to radiation seems to be mainly caused by CT examinations of the abdomen. For that reason, imaging methods such as MRI or ultrasound should be considered first when debating between alternative imaging strategies, particularly in young IBD patients. The major drawbacks of MRI are its limited availability and greater costs compared to CT. Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound is clearly operator dependent, which limits the range of its applications. In light of these concerns, diagnostic imaging studies using radiation will continue to play an important role in the evaluation of patients with IBD. Therefore, we need to develop low-radiation imaging protocols or improve access to MRI imaging procedures. We also need to identify subsets of IBD patients who are at greater risk of a significant lifetime exposure to radiation and develop methods to monitor their radiation exposure rate.",M1
19759320,"Filling-in, spatial summation, and <e>radiation</e> of pain: evidence for a neural population code in the nociceptive system.The receptive field organization of nociceptive neurons suggests that noxious information may be encoded by population-based mechanisms. Electrophysiological evidence of population coding mechanisms has remained limited. However, psychophysical studies examining interactions between multiple noxious stimuli can provide indirect evidence that neuron population recruitment can contribute to both spatial and intensity-related percepts of pain. In the present study, pairs of thermal stimuli (35 degrees C/49 degrees C or 49 degrees C/49 degrees C) were delivered at different distances on the leg (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 cm) and abdomen (within and across dermatomes) and subjects evaluated pain intensity and perceived spatial attributes of stimuli. Reports of perceived pain spreading to involve areas that were not stimulated (radiation of pain) were most frequent at 5- and 10-cm distances (chi(2) = 34.107, P &lt; 0.0001). Perceived connectivity between two noxious stimuli (filling-in) was influenced by the distance between stimuli (chi(2) = 16.756, P &lt; 0.01), with the greatest connectivity reported at 5- and 10-cm separation distances. Spatial summation of pain occurred over probe separation distances as large as 40 cm and six dermatomes (P &lt; 0.05), but was maximal at 5- and 10-cm separation distances. Taken together, all three of these phenomena suggest that interactions between recruited populations of neurons may support both spatial and intensity-related dimensions of the pain experience.",M1

Its primary area of interest is biological effects of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation, including radiofrequency (RF) energy. The public interest in possible health effects attributed to RF energy, such as emitted by mobile phones, wireless telephone base stations, TV and radio broadcasting facilities, Wi-Fi systems and many other sources, has been accompanied by commentary in the media that varies considerably in reliability and usefulness for their audience. The focus of this COMAR Technical Information Statement is to identify quality sources of scientific information on potential health risks from exposure to RF energy. This Statement provides readers with references to expert reports and other reliable sources of information about this topic, most of which are available on the Internet. This report summarizes the conclusions from several major reports and comments on the markedly different conclusions in the BioInitiative Report (abbreviated BIR below). Since appearing on the Internet in August 2007, the BIR has received much media attention but, more recently, has been criticized by several health organizations (see Section titled  Views of health agencies about BIR ). COMAR concludes that the weight of scientific evidence in the RF bioeffects literature does not support the safety limits recommended by the BioInitiative group. For this reason, COMAR recommends that public health officials continue to base their policies on RF safety limits recommended by established and sanctioned international organizations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, which is formally related to the World Health Organization.",M1
19736749,"Generic <e>radiation</e> quarantine treatments: the next steps.In 2006, U.S. Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service published a landmark rule providing generic radiation quarantine treatments. The rule approved radiation doses of 150 Gy for any tephritid fruit fly and 400 Gy for all other insects except the pupa and adult stages of Lepidoptera. The generic radiation treatments apply to all fresh horticultural commodities. Therefore, if a pest risk assessment demonstrates that no pupae or adult Lepidoptera are associated with a commodity, export approval can be forthcoming with no further research. Generic treatments are the culmination of decades of research but not an end point. Future research on quarantine and phytosanitary uses of radiation should focus on 1) development of specific doses for quarantine Lepidoptera not covered by the generic treatments, 2) reduction of dose levels for specific pests and commodities to shorten treatment time and minimize any deleterious effects of radiation treatment on commodity quality, 3) development of generic doses below 400 Gy for important groups of quarantine arthropods other than fruit flies, and 4) development of information on commodity tolerance and development of value-added irradiated fresh products that use generic radiation treatments. Generic treatments will facilitate safe trade between countries that have approved phytosanitary uses of radiation for fresh agricultural commodities.",M1
19731649,"Assessment of near-future policy instruments for oceangoing shipping: impact on atmospheric aerosol burdens and the earth's <e>radiation</e> budget.We apply the global climate model ECHAM5/MESSy1-MADE with detailed aerosol and cloud microphysics to study the impact of shipping on tropospheric aerosol burdens, clouds, and the radiation budget for four near-future ship emission policy scenarios for the year 2012. We compare a  No Control  scenario with global sulfur limits and regionally applied reductions. We show that, if no control measures are taken, near surface sulfate increases by about 10-20% over the main transoceanic shipping routes from 2002 to 2012. A reduction of the maximum fuel sulfur (S) content allowed within 200 nautical miles of coastal areas ( global emission control areas ) to 0.5% or 0.1% (5000 or 1000 ppm S, respectively) results in a distinctive reduction in near surface sulfate from shipping in coastal regions compared with the year 2002. The model results also show that if emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) remain unabated, a reduction of the fuel sulfur content favors a strong increase in aerosol nitrate (NO3) which could counteract up to 20% of the decrease in sulfate mass achieved by sulfur emission reductions. The most important impact of shipping on the radiation budget is related to the modification of low maritime stratus clouds resulting in an increased reflectivity and enhanced shortwave cloud forcing. The direct aerosol effect from shipping is small. Our study shows that one can expect a less negative (less cooling) radiative forcing due to reductions in the current fuel sulfur content of ocean-going ships. The global annual average net cloud forcings due to shipping (year 2012) are in the range of -0.27 to -0.58 W/m2 with regional cooling occurring most over the remote oceans.",M1

Radiation effects to humans are of major concern during human space missions and also due to the increasing aviation altitudes and flight time. ICRP recommendations lead to adaptations of the Basic Safety Standards by the European Council. Beginning in the 1990 s up to now, significant improvements and findings in aviation dosimetry and epidemiology were done word-wide. Five research projects on measurements and modelling cosmic radiation exposure were supported by European Research Framework Programmes.

Potential applications include the x-ray diagnosis of laser-produced plasmas and x-ray imaging of, e.g., biological samples, using the highly monochromatic <e>radiation</e> at synchrotron light sources. The results obtained for x rays are, however, valid for a wide spectrum of the electromagnetic radiation so that, for instance, an application of one of the imaging schemes to lithography in the EUV wavelength range should also be possible, if the spherically bent crystals are replaced by appropriate spherical reflectors. Also described is the design of an x-ray crystal spectrometer, which meets the here defined, necessary requirements for the observation of the x-ray spectra of helium-like argon.",M1

The values of the diffusion exponent 'n' have been obtained (0.64, 0.58 and 0.57), respectively, in distilled water, pH 2.2 buffer and pH 7.4 buffer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electromagnetic fields of 50, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 5000 Hz frequencies and 1.5 microT intensity were generated using a transverse electromagnetic wave guide. Guinea pigs of both sexes, weighing 100-150 g, were used, with no abnormalities on general and otic examination. Total exposure times were: 360 hours for 50, 500 and 1000 Hz; 3300 hours for 2000 Hz; 4820 hours for 4000 Hz; and 6420 hours for 5000 Hz. One control animal was used in each frequency group. The parameters measured by electric response audiometer included: hearing level; waves I-IV latencies; wave I-III interpeak latency; and percentage appearance of waves I-III at 90 and 50 dB sound pressure level intensity. RESULTS: Values for the above parameters did not differ significantly, comparing the control animal and the rest of each group. In addition, no significant differences were found between our findings and those of previous studies of normal guinea pigs. CONCLUSION: Prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields of 50 Hz to 5 KHz frequencies and 1.5 microT intensity, produced no functional or morphological alteration in the outer hair cells of the guinea pig organ of Corti.",M1
19565908,"Using in vivo biopanning for the development of <e>radiation</e>-guided drug delivery systems.This chapter illustrates our protocol for in vivo biopanning using T7 bacteriophage libraries for the purpose of selecting recombinant peptides for the tumor-specific delivery of radiosensitizers to radiation-inducible antigens within tumor neovasculature. Our goal is to discover peptides binding within tumor vascular endothelium of irradiated tumors. We have previously demonstrated that tumor irradiation increases the spectrum of antigenic targets for drug delivery. To identify candidate peptides with the ability to bind radiation-induced antigens, we inject the phage peptide library intravenously into mice bearing irradiated GL261 and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) hind limb tumors. Phage are recovered from excised tumors, amplified, and readministered to mouse-bearing tumors for six total rounds. At least 50 bacterial colonies are selected from each of the tumor types, and prioritized. This prioritization is based on their relative concentrations in tumor versus normal tissues, and then assessment of dominant phage present in both tumor types. These phage are amplified, and the gene sequences determined to deduce the recombinant peptide product. Further prioritization is performed by fluorescence labeling of the selected phage, and injection into irradiated and mock-irradiated tumor-bearing mice for evaluation of in vivo targeting of the candidate phage/peptides.",M1
19551206,"The photoionisation of two phenylcarbenes and their diazirine precursors investigated using synchrotron <e>radiation</e>.Two phenylcarbenes, chlorophenylcarbene (CPC) and trifluoromethylphenylcarbene (TFPC), were generated by jet flash pyrolysis of diazirine precursors. Their photoionisation was studied by photoelectron-photoion coincidence spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation. For CPC we determined an adiabatic ionisation energy (IE) of 8.15 eV and a vertical IE of 9.3 eV. For TFPC we obtained an adiabatic IE of 8.47 eV and a vertical IE of 8.95 eV. The photoelectron spectra are broad and unstructured due to a large increase in the angle between the phenyl group, carbene centre and the substituent (Cl or CF(3)). The geometry change upon ionisation is more pronounced for CPC. Being a singlet arylcarbene, CPC is more strongly bent in the neutral ground state than the triplet TFPC. In addition, the bond between the carbenic centre and the chlorine atom shortens upon ionisation, because the radical cation is stabilised by the non-bonding electrons of the Cl through a mesomeric effect. The photoionisation and dissociative photoionisation of the diazirine precursors are also explored. The CPC precursor, 3-chloro-3-phenyldiazirine, undergoes complete dissociative photoionisation and only the CPC(+) fragment is observed above 8.8 eV. For 3-trifluoromethyl-3-phenyldiazirine some molecular ions can be observed above 9.05 eV. However, dissociative photoionisation also sets in right at the ionisation threshold. A fit to the data yields an appearance energy of AE (0 K) approximately 9.27 eV.",M1
19550491,"Interaction of radially polarized focused light with a prolate spheroidal nanoparticle.The interaction of a nanoparticle with light is affected by nanoparticle geometry and composition, as well as by focused beam parameters, such as the polarization and numerical aperture of the beam. The interaction of a radially focused beam with a prolate spheroidal nanoparticle is particularly important because it has the potential to produce strong near-field electromagnetic <e>radiation</e>. Strong and tightly localized longitudinal components of a radially polarized focused beam can excite strong plasmon modes on elongated nanoparticles such as prolate spheroids. In this study, near field radiation from a prolate spheriodal nanoparticle is investigated when it is illuminated with a radially polarized focused beam of light. Near-field radiation from the nanoparticle is investigated in the absence and presence of metallic layers. It is shown that the interaction of a radially polarized focused beam with a prolate spheroidal nanoparticle can be enhanced by creating images of monopole charges using metallic layers. In addition, it is also observed that the presence of a metallic layer shifts the resonance of the prolate spheroid toward longer wavelengths. Dipole, quadruple, and off resonance field distributions for particles with different sizes and aspect ratios are presented when they are illuminated with a radially focused beam of light.",M1
19534155,"Communication of <e>radiation</e>-induced signals in vivo between DNA repair deficient and proficient medaka (Oryzias latipes).Radiation-induced bystander effects are established consequences of exposure to ionizing radiation. The operation of this mechanism has been seen in vitro and also between fish, mammals, and plants in vive where stress signals from treated organisms induce responses in neighbors. In vitro research shows that DNA repair deficient cells produce more toxic bystander responses. To test this in vivo two strains of Japanese medaka were tested. One is a mutant, repair deficient strain (ric2) and the other, the wildtype repair proficient strain (CAB). Irradiated fish swam with unirradiated partners in a strain mix and match protocol. The data suggest that medaka produce signals, when exposed to radiation, that induce unirradiated fish ofthe same strain swimming with them to produce an altered response to that seen in bystanders to sham irradiated fish. More apoptosis was seen in bystanders to repair deficient fish. When the strains are mixed, the bystanders of either strain respond like the donor strain. Measurements of Bcl-2 and cmyc proteins in the explants confirmed these observations. A possible role for p53 was also identified in that the use of reporters with mutant p53 demonstrated that CAB signals killed all the reporter cells by apoptosis. Use of a similar but p53 wildtype cell line had no such effect. The data add to the body of knowledge showing that bystander signals operate at hierarchical levels of organization greater than the individual and may therefore have relevance in radioecology and (eco)systems biology.",M1
19507138,"Effects of e-beam <e>radiation</e>, storage, and hydration on osteoinductivity of DBM/AM composite.E-beam irradiation is often used to sterilize medical devices including demineralized bone matrix (DBM) products. In this study, the effect of e-beam on osteoinductivity of a DBM product in hydrous and anhydrous configurations has been evaluated at 0-, 6- and 12-month ambient storage using a nude rat muscle pouch model. The thermal and structural stabilities of DBM and acellular dermal matrix (AM) composites were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and trypsin digestion assay. Both hydrous and anhydrous DBM/AM composites exhibited osteoinductivity after e-beam irradiation of 15 kGy. After 12-month ambient storage, the osteoinductivity of hydrous DBM/AM was diminished, whereas the anhydrous DBM/AM retained its osteoinductive potential. However, the DSC and trypsin analysis revealed that the DBM in anhydrous DBM/AM was more vulnerable to damage from e-beam irradiation than its hydrous counterpart. This study has found that although the anhydrous DBM has more structural damage than hydrous DBM from e-beam irradiation, it has retained its osteoinductivity better after 1-year ambient storage.",M1
19486866,"<e>Radiation</e>-induced micronucleus formation and DNA damage in human lymphocytes and their prevention by antioxidant thiols.Thiol family of antioxidants has been considered to be the most effective class of radio protective agents. Present study reports a comparative evaluation of antioxidant thiols, namely N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), glutathione (GSH) and thioproline (TP), on gamma radiation-induced damage to human lymphocytes DNA as assessed by micronucleus (MN) formation and comet assay parameters. Pretreatment of cells with NAC, GSH and TP showed significant protection against DNA damage and MN frequency in irradiated lymphocytes (2-4 Gy). The magnitude of DNA damage protection was found to be concentration dependent (100-300 microM) which followed the order GSH&gt;NAC&gt;TP. Further, antioxidant thiols mediated protection against DNA damage in irradiated lymphocyte showed significant correlation with their ability to decrease intracellular ROS but not to the increase in intracellular GSH. Experiments on the effect of antioxidant thiols on plasmid DNA irradiated under cell free aqueous conditions showed that NAC exerts greater protection than GSH against radiation damage. TP showed similar responses in cellular and plasmid DNA. Greater protection of plasmid DNA by NAC is ascribable to its more potential hydrogen donor ability as revealed by radical chromogen 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) photometric assay. Thus, present study indicated that radioprotection of lymphocytes DNA by antioxidant thiols are closely correlated to the reduction of cellular oxidative stress, which seems to involve multiple mechanisms.",M1
19486011,"Improvement of <e>radiation</e>-induced healing delay by etanercept treatment in rat arteries.Surgical treatment often causes difficulty in the irradiated field because of delayed wound healing, which is mainly due to vascular dysfunction. To overcome this difficulty, we attempted to accelerate the recovery from clamp injury in irradiated superficial epigastric arteries of rats as a model. Etanercept, a soluble receptor of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, was administered four times to rats with irradiated arteries before and after clamp injury. Loss of endothelial cells and necrosis of the media in the irradiated arteries continued for more than 1 week after the injury; however, in the rats treated with etanercept, the endothelial cells recovered in the intima, and alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive smooth muscle cells recovered in the injured and irradiated arteries. After clamp injury of common carotid arteries that had previously been irradiated, the blood flow in these arteries was visualized by magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. The time-of-flight signal was weakened in the injured and irradiated arteries. This time-of-flight signal was recovered by the etanercept treatment. These findings suggest that etanercept improves the radiation-impaired healing of arteries in rats.",M1
19425636,"Material properties from acoustic <e>radiation</e> force step response.An ultrasonic technique for estimating viscoelastic properties of hydrogels, including engineered biological tissues, is being developed. An acoustic radiation force is applied to deform the gel locally while Doppler pulses track the induced movement. The system efficiently couples radiation force to the medium through an embedded scattering sphere. A single-element, spherically-focused, circular piston element transmits a continuous-wave burst to suddenly apply and remove a radiation force to the sphere. Simultaneously, a linear array and spectral Doppler technique are applied to track the position of the sphere over time. The complex shear modulus of the gel was estimated by applying a harmonic oscillator model to measurements of time-varying sphere displacement. Assuming that the stress-strain response of the surrounding gel is linear, this model yields an impulse response function for the gel system that may be used to estimate material properties for other load functions. The method is designed to explore the force-frequency landscape of cell-matrix viscoelasticity. Reported measurements of the shear modulus of gelatin gels at two concentrations are in close agreement with independent rheometer measurements of the same gels. Accurate modulus measurements require that the rate of Doppler-pulse transmission be matched to a priori estimates of gel properties.",M1
19402716,"Comparative theoretical and experimental study of the <e>radiation</e>-induced decomposition of glycine.The radiation-induced decomposition of glycine is studied using a combination of near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) measurements and DFT calculations. The measured spectra show strong dose- or time-dependent effects consistent with a complex, multistep decomposition. Principal component analysis was used to determine the number of distinct molecules that were needed to explain the observed changes in the measured spectra, and the emerging absorption features are assigned to various product molecules through comparison with simulated spectra of several model compounds. It is clear from the experiment that the major effect of soft X-ray irradiation is the fragmentation of the molecule, primarily at the carbonyl sites. Peptide formation is shown to occur under irradiation; a condensation reaction initiated by the removal of a carbonyl oxygen is the proposed mechanism. This study utilizes a novel approach to the study of radiation damage that can occur during measurements and suggests that it may be possible to use simulated model spectra to correct for these effects in measured spectra.",M1
19398854,"Microarray analysis of differentially expressed genes in the kidneys and testes of mice after long-term irradiation with low-dose-rate gamma-rays.Measuring global gene expression using cDNA or oligonucleotide microarrays is an effective approach to understanding the complex mechanisms of the effects of <e>radiation</e>. However, few studies have been carried out that investigate gene expression in vivo after prolonged exposure to low-dose-rate radiation. In this study, C57BL/6J mice were continuously irradiated with gamma-rays for 485 days at dose-rates of 0.032-13 microGy/min. Gene expression profiles in the kidney and testis from irradiated and unirradiated mice were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were identified. A combination of pathway analysis and hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes revealed that expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was elevated in the kidney after irradiation at the dose-rates of 0.65 microGy/min and 13 microGy/min. Expression of cell cycle-associated genes was not profoundly modulated in the kidney, in contrast to the response to acute irradiation, suggesting a threshold in the dose-rate for modulation of the expression of cell cycle-related genes in vivo following exposure to radiation. We demonstrated that changes to the gene expression profile in the testis were largely different from those in the kidney. The Gene Ontology categories  DNA metabolism ,  response to DNA damage  and  DNA replication  overlapped significantly with the clusters of genes whose expression decreased with an increase in the dose-rate to the testis. These observations provide a fundamental insight into the organ-specific responses to low-dose-rate radiation.",M1
19396951,"Single injection of a low dose of pentylenetetrazole leads to epileptogenesis in an animal model of cortical dysplasia.PURPOSE: Cortical dysplasia (CD) is one of the most frequent causes of pharmacoresistent focal epilepsy. Despite significant advances in various diagnostic and therapeutic methods, the basic mechanisms of higher susceptibility for seizures in patients with CD are unknown. Animal models of CD present with a lower threshold for seizure induction. The purpose of this study is to further characterize the animal model of in utero <e>radiation</e>-induced CD and to illustrate the effect of a late postnatal second hit (low dose of pentylenetetrazole, PTZ) on the development of spontaneous seizures. METHODS: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were irradiated on E17 (145 cGy; control group was left untreated). Litters were implanted with bifrontal epidural and hippocampal depth electrodes. After baseline electroencephalography (EEG) recording, animals received 30 mg/kg PTZ and were chronically monitored. Histopathology of the brains was verified. RESULTS: No seizures were detected in animals that did not receive PTZ. PTZ-injected irradiated (XRT) rats showed severe prolonged, repetitive seizures during the acute period. During the chronic period, XRT rats had recurrent seizures and epileptiform spikes. PTZ-injected control animals exhibited milder and fewer acute seizures and did not show seizures during the chronic period. Histology was consistent with cortical and hippocampal dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a single treatment with a low dose of PTZ renders XRT rats (but not age-matched controls) epileptic, exhibiting spontaneous epileptiform spikes and seizures on EEG. These results might mirror the natural history of patients with CD thought to be caused by prenatal/congenital or perinatal insults.",M1

19259871,"Intercomparison of instruments used for safety and performance measurements of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation lamps.Public health concerns such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, bioterrorism, pandemic influenza, and sick building syndrome have brought about increased interest in the use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) to prevent the spread of airborne infection. UVGI lamps require that radiometric measurements be performed to ensure their safe and effective use. This study evaluates 10 detectors that measure the ultraviolet <e>radiation</e> hazard of low-pressure mercury UVGI lamps, including a polychromator spectroradiometer, narrowband detectors designed to measure the ultraviolet radiation in a short range of wavelengths, and broadband detectors with a varying spectral response designed to follow the UV hazard action spectrum. The angular responses, spectral responses, and linearity of the detectors were measured and compared. The agreement between the measured angular responses and the ideal cosine responses varied widely among the detectors, and in general, the detectors with diffusing optics agreed significantly better with the ideal cosine response. The spectral responses at 254 nm also varied widely among the detectors, and, in general, the narrowband detectors agreed more closely with the 254 nm irradiances measured under the same conditions by a double monochromator spectroradiometer. All detectors displayed good linearity. The angular and spectral response data were then used to develop correction factors for the effective irradiance measurements of two UVGI sources, each measured at 10, 20, and 30 cm. The measured effective irradiances were compared with those measured by a double monochromator spectroradiometer with an integrating sphere input optic. Prior to correction, the effective irradiances measured by the detectors varied widely, ranging from 0.29 to 2.7 times those measured by the spectroradiometer. The application of cosine and spectral response correction factors significantly improved the agreement for the effective irradiances measured by all of the detectors, typically to within 10-20%. Awareness of these detector characteristics can play a key role in ensuring the accuracy of health hazard measurements of UVGI lamps.",M1

In this study, bulk samples of CFQ materials were exposed to 10 MeV electrons at doses between 5-15 and 25-35 kGy; the dose ranges normally used for processing and sterilization. After irradiation, the samples were subjected to electron spin resonance analysis to test the intensity of their signal against the applied doses. The reproducibility of dose curve of the material to 10 MeV electrons was also studied, in which the dosed samples were annealed at 800 degrees C for 20 min and reused for further dose curve reproducibility investigation. The dose response curves of the reused samples showed a good linearity between the absorbed dose and the ESR intensity of the signals. They also indicated that the ESR intensity in the dose response curve, in both dose ranges, decreased by approximately 37% for the first reuse process and approximately 41% for the second reuse process of the samples in comparison to the first measurement. The thermal fading of the cylindrical samples of the CFQ, at room temperature, showed a sharp decay of approximately 20% over a period of 15 days, after which the decay-rate was negligible for a measured period of 60 days.",M1

Kinetic, potential and Reynolds stress energy densities are defined and evaluated with and in the absence of absorption in the layer. Without absorption, the mechanical energy density counteracts the Reynolds stress energy density, which causes a repulsive force. However, in the case of absorption, the attractive force is predicted to be a physical consequence of a mutual contribution of both the mechanical and the Reynolds stress energy densities. This condition provides an impetus for further designing acoustic tweezers operating with plane progressive waves as well as fabricating polymer-coated gold particles for specific biophysical and biomedical applications.",M1
19213633,"Image quality, tissue heating, and frame rate trade-offs in acoustic <e>radiation</e> force impulse imaging.The real-time application of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging requires both short acquisition times for a single ARFI image and repeated acquisition of these frames. Due to the high energy of pulses required to generate appreciable radiation force, however, repeated acquisitions could result in substantial transducer face and tissue heating. We describe and evaluate several novel beam sequencing schemes which, along with parallel-receive acquisition, are designed to reduce acquisition time and heating. These techniques reduce the total number of radiation force impulses needed to generate an image and minimize the time between successive impulses. We present qualitative and quantitative analyses of the trade-offs in image quality resulting from the acquisition schemes. Results indicate that these techniques yield a significant improvement in frame rate with only moderate decreases in image quality. Tissue and transducer face heating resulting from these schemes is assessed through finite element method modeling and thermocouple measurements. Results indicate that heating issues can be mitigated by employing ARFI acquisition sequences that utilize the highest track-to-excitation ratio possible.",M1

19187543,"<e>Radiation</e> produces differential changes in cytokine profiles in radiation lung fibrosis sensitive and resistant mice.BACKGROUND: Recent research has supported that a variety of cytokines play important roles during radiation-induced lung toxicity. The present study is designed to investigate the differences in early cytokine induction after radiation in sensitive (C57BL/6) and resistant mice (C3H). RESULTS: Twenty-two cytokines in the lung tissue homogenates, bronchial lavage (BAL) fluids, and serum from 3, 6, 12, 24 hrs to 1 week after 12 Gy whole lung irradiation were profiled using a microsphere-based multiplexed cytokine assay. The majority of cytokines had similar baseline levels in C57BL/6 and C3H mice, but differed significantly after radiation. Many, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) were elevated significantly in specimens from both strains. They usually peaked at about 3-6 hrs in C57BL/6 and 6-12 hrs in C3H. At 6 hrs in lung tissue, G-CSF, IL-6, and KC increased 6, 8, and 11 fold in C57BL/6 mice, 4, 3, and 3 fold in the C3H mice, respectively. IL-6 was 10-fold higher at 6 hrs in the C57BL/6 BAL fluid than the C3H BAL fluid. MCP-1, IP-10, and IL-1alpha also showed some differences between strains in the lung tissue and/or serum. For the same cytokine and within the same strain of mice, there were significant linear correlations between lung tissue and BAL fluid levels (R2 ranged 0.46-0.99) and between serum and tissue (R2 ranged 0.56-0.98). CONCLUSION: Radiation induced earlier and greater temporal changes in multiple cytokines in the pulmonary fibrosis sensitive mice. Positive correlation between serum and tissue levels suggests that blood may be used as a surrogate marker for tissue.",M1

19172383,"<e>Radiation</e>-guided targeting of combretastatin encapsulated immunoliposomes to mammary tumors.PURPOSE: Radiation upregulates expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules providing a potential avenue for targeting drugs to irradiated tissue. Induced upregulation of E-selectin can be used to target immunoliposomes to solid tumors. The effects of targeting immunoliposomes containing the antivascular drug combretastatin disodium phosphate (CA4P) to irradiated mammary tumors were investigated in this study. METHODS: Mice bearing transplanted MCa-4 mouse mammary tumors were assigned to one of the factorial treatments permuting the administration of free CA4P, tumor irradiation, CA4P encapsulated liposomes, and CA4P encapsulated immunoliposomes (conjugated with anti-E-selectin). Single and fractionated dosing of radiation and/or CA4P was evaluated. RESULTS: For single dose treatments the group that received a single dose of radiation plus a single dose of immunoliposomes showed a significant delay in tumor growth compared to all other treatment groups. Fractionated radiation plus fractionated doses of immunoliposomes resulted in further tumor growth delay; however, it was not significantly different from other fractionated dose treatment groups that combined radiation and CA4P. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting of antivascular drugs to irradiated tumors via ligand-bearing liposomes results in significant tumor growth delay. This effect can be further potentiated using a fractionated irradiation dosing schedule combined with fractionated immunoliposome treatments.",M1

Four patients engrafted quickly, experienced minimal toxicity and are well at 43-65 months post-transplant. One patient had a C-mismatched unrelated donor transplant and had unsustained engraftment.

19138728,"Inhibition of adult hippocampal neurogenesis disrupts contextual learning but spares spatial working memory, long-term conditional rule retention and spatial reversal.Neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus has been implicated in neural plasticity and cognition but the specific functions contributed by adult-born neurons remain controversial. Here, we have explored the relationship between adult hippocampal neurogenesis and memory function using tasks which specifically require the participation of the DG. In two separate experiments several groups of rats were exposed to fractionated ionizing <e>radiation</e> (two sessions of 7 Gy each on consecutive days) applied either to the whole brain or focally, aiming at a region overlying the hippocampus. The immunocytochemical assays showed that the radiation significantly reduced the expression of doublecortin (DCX), a marker for immature neurons, in the dorsal DG. Ultrastructural examination of the DG region revealed disruption of progenitor cell niches several weeks after the radiation. In the first experiment, whole-brain and focal irradiation reduced DCX expression by 68% and 43%, respectively. Whole-brain and focally-irradiated rats were unimpaired compared with control rats in a matching-to-place (MTP) working memory task performed in the T-maze and in the long-term retention of the no-alternation rule. In the second experiment, focal irradiation reduced DCX expression by 36% but did not impair performance on (1) a standard non-matching-to-place (NMTP) task, (2) a more demanding NMTP task with increasingly longer within-trial delays, (3) a long-term retention test of the alternation rule and (4) a spatial reversal task. However, rats irradiated focally showed clear deficits in a  purely  contextual fear-conditioning task at short and long retention intervals. These data demonstrate that reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis produces marked deficits in the rapid acquisition of emotionally relevant contextual information but spares spatial working memory function, the long-term retention of acquired spatial rules and the ability to flexibly modify learned spatial strategies.",M1

Emergence of parasites often occurs once a day, which may help to minimise mortality in an inhospitable environment and increase transition rates. Many intestinal parasites in birds are released in faeces only in the late afternoon. However, the adaptative significance of this pattern is unclear. One hypothesis is that a particular time of emergence may prevent parasite desiccation and therefore increase the parasite's life expectancy in the external environment. We tested this hypothesis experimentally using the blackbird (Turdus merula) infected with Isospora turdi (Protozoa: Apicomplexa). We found that short exposure of faeces to natural sunlight has a dramatic effect on oocyst survival. This appears to be due to the effect of warmth and ultraviolet (UV) radiation with UVB waves being more damaging than UVA. Oocysts contained in faeces shed in water are protected from the effect of sunlight. Together, these results suggest that the release of oocysts in the late afternoon is an adaptative trait to avoid desiccation and UV radiation, thus reducing mortality of the oocysts in the external environment.",M1
19086710,"Comparison of <e>radiation</e> exposure in lumbar pedicle screw placement with fluoroscopy vs computer-assisted image guidance with intraoperative three-dimensional imaging.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the long-term effects of chronic exposure to ionizing radiation. Studies have shown that spine surgeons may be exposed to significantly more radiation than that observed in surgery on the appendicular skeleton. Computer-assisted image guidance systems have been shown in preliminary studies to enable accurate instrumentation of the spine. Computer-assisted image guidance systems may have significant application to the surgical management of spinal trauma and deformity. The objective of this study was to compare C-arm fluoroscopy and computer-assisted image guidance in terms of radiation exposure to the operative surgeon when placing pedicle screw-rod constructs in cadaver specimens. METHODS: Twelve single-level (2 contiguous vertebral bodies) lumbar pedicle screw-rod constructs (48 screws) in 4 fresh cadavers were placed using standard C-arm fluoroscopy and computer-assisted image guidance (Stealth Station with Iso-C(3D)). Pedicle screw-rod constructs were placed at L1-L2, L3-L4, and L5-S1 in 4 fresh cadaver specimens. Imaging was alternated between C-arm fluoroscopy and computer-assisted image guidance with StealthStation Iso-C(3D). Radiation exposure was measured using ring and badge dosimeters to monitor the thyroid, torso, and index finger. Postprocedure CT scans were obtained to judge accuracy of screw placement. RESULTS: Mean radiation exposure to the torso was 4.33 +/- 2.66 mRem for procedures performed with standard fluoroscopy and 0.33 +/- 0.82 mRem for procedures performed with computer-assisted image guidance. This difference was statistically significant (P= 0.012). Radiation exposure to the index finger and thyroid was negligible for all procedures. The accuracy of screw placement was similar for both techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Computer-assisted image guidance systems allow for the safe and accurate placement of pedicle screw-rod constructs with a significant reduction in exposure to ionizing radiation to the torso of the operating surgeon.",M1

On the other hand, great anxiety is often felt due to the misunderstanding of radiation, and this anxiety is seen in not only patients but also nurses. In this study, a questionnaire survey about knowledge of radiation and the level of anxiety was carried out in student nurses for three years from 2005 to 2007. The questionnaire included the level of anxiety about radiation and 12 basic question items concerning radiation. The results showed that the student with poor knowledge about radiation showed high anxiety. After a series of lectures concerning radiation, the acquisition of knowledge and a decrease in anxiety were observed in the students. However, it was still shown that people with scarce knowledge concerning radiation still had high anxiety at the end of the lectures. In conclusion, it was shown that education about radiation is necessary to decrease anxiety about radiation among nurses in medical care.",M1

19068825,"<e>Radiation</e>-stability of smectite.The safety assessment of geological repositories for high-level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel requires an understanding of the response of materials to high temperatures and intense radiation fields. Clays, such as smectite, have been proposed as backfill material around waste packages, but their response to intense radiation from short-lived fission products and alpha decay of sorbed actinides remains poorly understood. Cumulative doses may amorphize clays and may alter their properties of sorption, swelling, or water retention. We describe the amorphization of smectites induced by electron and heavy ion irradiations to simulate ionizing radiation and alpha recoil nuclei, respectively. A new  bell-shaped  evolution of the amorphization dose with temperature has been determined. The maximum dose for amorphization occurs at about 300-400 degrees C, showing that temperature-induced dehydroxylation enhances amorphization. The exact shape of the bell-shaped curves depends on the interlayer cation. At ambient temperature, ionizing radiation and alpha-decay events do not show the same efficiency. The former results in amorphization at doses between 10(10)-10(11) Gy which are greater than the total radiation dose expected for radioactive waste over 10(6) years. In contrast, alpha-decay events amorphize clays at doses as low as 0.13-0.16 displacements per atom, i.e. doses consistent with nuclear waste accumulated over approximately 1000 yrs. However, the limited penetration of alpha particles and recoil nuclei, in the 100 nm - 20 microm range, will minimize damage. Clays will not be amorphized unless the waste package is breached and released actinides are heavily sorbed onto the clay overpack.",M1
19045760,"Acoustic <e>radiation</e> torque on an irregularly shaped scatterer in an arbitrary sound field.To eliminate the limitation of the conventional acoustic radiation torque theory, which is only applicable to a disklike scatterer in a plane sound field, a new theory is established to calculate the radiation torque on any irregularly shaped scatterer in any arbitrary sound field. First, with the aid of the conservation law of angular momentum, the acoustic radiation torque is expressed as the angular momentum flux through a spherical surface with the center at the scatterer's centroid. Second, the velocity potential of the scattered field is derived, taking into account the influences of the translational and rotational movements of the scatterer induced by the first order stress of the incident sound field. Finally, a general calculating formula of the acoustic radiation torque is achieved. For a disklike scatterer in a plane sound filed, results from the above formula are well identical with those conventional formulas. By studying the case of a semicircular cylinder scatterer in a standing-wave sound field, it is found that for an irregularly shaped scatterer its rotation velocity is normally nonzero and the radiation torque changes with the spatial attitude.",M1

SR microbeam X-ray fluorescence (SR-mu-XRF) imaging showed a high level of arsenic accumulation in the iron ore as dots of ca. 20 microm. Based on SEM observations and SR X-ray powder diffraction (SR-XRD) analysis, it was found that arsenic is selectively accumulated in strengite (FePO4 x 2H2O) with a concentric morphology, which may be produced by a biologically induced process. Furthermore, the X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis showed that arsenic in strengite exists in the arsenate (AsO4(3-)) form and is coordinated by four oxygen atoms at 1.68 angstroms. The results suggest that strengite accumulates arsenic by isomorphous substitution of AsO4(3-) for PO4(3-) to form a partial solid-solution of strengite and scorodite (FeAsO4 x 2H2O). The specific correlation between the distribution of As and biominerals indicates that microorganisms seems to play an important role in the mineralization of strengite in combination with an arsenic-accumulating process.",M1

In 1990, the Korea Biomaterial Research Institute (KBRI) organised the IAEA/RCA training course on tissue banking. In this course students from 17 countries participated. In 1994 the first collaboration for cadaver tissue recovery was performed. It is important to single out that the various religious groups in Korea have favourable attitudes towards tissue donation, which contributes to the success of the tissue banking programs in the country. The demands of allograft were getting increased in the Korean medical and dental society. Currently, 62 hospital based bone banks, 5 processing tissue banks, 1 regional tissue bank and more than 30 tissue distributors are working in Korea. Based on the U.S.A. usage of more than 1,000,000 grafts per year, 100,000-200,000 grafts will be needed in Korea. Those findings indicate a greatly increased need for training of tissue bank operators. The Korean society will need at least 20-30 tissue bank operators for training in every year. The National Training Centre (NTC) for tissue bank operators and medical personal using the IAEA Curriculum in the Korean languages was established in 2003. From 2004 to 2006, NTC have been trained 40 tissue bank operators. They have produced at least 10,000 tissues per year. These figures indicate a cost saving of US$ 10 million.

The results indicate that the ADAM model and the aerosol dynamic model simulate quite well the spatial and temporal distributions of the mass concentration of aerosols with the R2 value of more than 0.7. The estimated mean total column aerosol mass in the analysis domain for the whole period is found to be about 78 mg m(-2), of which 66% and 34% are, respectively, contributed by the Asian dust aerosol and all the other anthropogenic aerosols. However, the direct radiative forcing contributed by the Asian dust aerosol is about 22% of the mean radiative forcing at the surface (-6.8 W m(-2)), about 31% at the top of atmosphere (-2.9 W m(-2)) and about 13% in the atmosphere (3.8 W m(-2)), suggesting relatively inefficient contribution of the Asian dust aerosol on the direct radiative forcing compared to the anthropogenic aerosols. The aerosol direct radiative forcing at the surface is mainly contributed by the mixed type aerosol (30%) and the SIA aerosol (25%) while at the top of atmosphere it is mainly contributed by the SIA aerosol (43%) and the Asian dust aerosol (31%) with positively (warming) contributed by BC and mixed type aerosols.

Photoacoustic thoeory is based on the absorption of electromagnetic <e>radiation</e> by analyte molecules, and the absorbed energy is measured by detecting pressure fluctuations in the form of sound waves or shock pulses. In contrast to conventional absorption spectroscopy, PAS allows the determination of absorption coefficients over several orders of magnitude, even in very black and strongly scattering soil samples. Red soil, fulvic soil and paddy soil were collected from Fengqiu National Ecological Experimental Station, Yingtan Red Soil Experimental Station, and Changshu Ecological Experimental Station, respectively. These soil samples were used as experimental materials to characterize the Fourier transform mid-infrared photoacoustic spectra (FTIR-PAS). Compared with infrared transmittance spectra and reflectance spectra, the testing of FTIR-PAS spectra was very fast and convenient without any pr-treatment, and there were more abundant absorptions as well as appropriate absorption values in the spectra; The main soil components (kaolin, bentonite, sand and CaCO3) also showed several strong absorptions with specific characteristics in the spectra; Further more, the interference of water with the PAS spectra was significantly smaller than that with reflectance spectra. Therefore, the soil properties could be better characterized by FTIR-PAS. The principal components analysis based on the FTIR-PAS spectra indicated that there were two main principal components (PCA1, PCA2) which contained 98.17% variance of the spectra, and the two-dimensionol distribution was made by plotting these two principal components to classify the soil type, and the results indicated that this distribution could be applied to distinguish soil type, which provided new technique for soil identification as well as further quantitative analysis in soil science.",M1

METHODOLOGY: Some members of staff who were present when the extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was used in the hospital at Okada were interviewed between November 2002 and August 2003. Radiology records of the hospital were studied. Literature search involved available publication on the procedure in local and international journals with interest in precautions to reducing radiation exposure. RESULTS: Only lead apron and lead gloves were used by the radiologists for radiation protection and shielding during fluoroscopy procedures. The fluoroscopy was the screen type with TV monitor. Multiple sessions were used in several patients with multiple pre- and post- treatment radiographic studies including contrast studies with average of two sessions per patient. All the patients were adults aged between 26 and 65 years with mean age of 42.5 years. 627-6000 shock waves were delivered over 45-135 minutes at intensity of 143-19KV depending on patients build and the size of the stones. The sizes of the patients varied from very obese with large bulk to slim built. Radiation monitoring of the staff and patients was not done. Staff believed that radiation effect from the lithotripsy procedure was low therefore adequate radiation monitoring and radiation reducing alteration in the procedure was rarely adopted. CONCLUSION: Extended fluoroscopy time, multiple fluoroscopy examinations, multiple treatment sessions and multiple x-ray examinations which increased both the patients' and staff's radiation exposures were noted. Proper radiation protection and monitoring of patients and staff are necessary to avoid the risks from low-level exposure to radiation such as in ESWL.",M1

Previous studies of environmental inequity have nevertheless indicated considerable complexity in the associations involved, which merit further investigation using more detailed data and more advanced analytical methods. This study investigates the ways in which environmental inequity in England varies in relation to: (a) different environmental pollutants (measured in different ways); (b) different aspects of socio-economic status; and (c) different geographical scales and contexts (urban vs. rural). Associations were analysed between the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD2004) and its domains and five sets of environmental pollutants (relating to road traffic, industry, electro-magnetic frequency <e>radiation</e>, disinfection by-products in drinking water and radon), measured in terms of proximity, emission intensity and environmental concentration. Associations were assessed using bivariate and multivariate correlation, and by comparing the highest and lowest quintiles of deprivation using Student's t-test and Hotelling's T2. Associations are generally weak (R(2) &lt; 0.10), and vary depending on the specific measures used. Strongest associations occur with what can be regarded as contingent components of deprivation (e.g. crime, living environment, health) rather than causative factors such as income, employment or education. Associations also become stronger with increasing level of spatial aggregation. Overall, the results suggest that any triple jeopardy for health, and problems of confounding, associated with environmental inequities are likely to be limited.",M1
18772612,"Case report: Iridium 192-health effects during 20 years after irradiation.This Case Report has presented health effects of high level of irradiation with gamma rays from Ir 192m on the patient M. L. during 21 years after the accident. The main purpose of this investigation was to analyze long time consequences of partial high-level irradiation on human health. Locally, short-term irradiation, with high deadly dose, caused acute <e>radiation</e> syndrome with reversible disorder function of the individual, most exposed, organs. Frequency of chromosomal aberrations (dicentric), characteristic for direct irradiation, was increased. However, dicentric analyzes did not give expected result for an acute radioactivity illness. Radio dermatitis had begun already after the incident, while changes on the heart began not earlier than six months and gradually have been increased up to two years after the incident. Irradiated parts of the patient skin have been replaced with auto-transplanted skin and appropriate therapy had been taken. More than two decades after the irradiation, system (leukemia) nor solitary tumor on near organs (liver, heart, lungs, bones) have not been appeared. Radiation illness did not happen in spite of very large dose, because impacts had been local and body was unlikely irradiated. Also, an appropriate therapy was organized and other potential illnesses did not appear.",M1
18772536,"[Preliminary survey for communicating risk in medical exposure--perception of risk among nurses working in radiology]A questionnaire survey was conducted on <e>radiation</e> risk and medical exposure, particularly in applications involving children. The survey was targeted at nurses (170 females) engaged in important roles in communicating risk regarding medical exposure. The questionnaire survey yielded the following findings. 1) A significant number of respondents associated the word  radiation  with  cancer treatment,   exposure,  and  X-ray pictures.  Perceptions about  food exposure  differed between respondents with children and those without. 2) Among the potential health problems posed by radiation,  effects on children,   cancer and leukemia,  and  genetic effects  were perceived as the most worrisome. Significant differences in perception were noted regarding infertility between respondents with children and those without. 3) Concerning the effects of medical exposure on fetuses/children, only 10 percent of all respondents replied that they were not anxious about negative effects in either case. Among the respondents who felt uneasy about these aspects, most tended to assess exposed parts, doses, damage potentially suffered, timing of occurrence, and uncertainty, based on their professional experience and knowledge, to rationally distinguish acceptable risks from unacceptable ones and to limit concern to the unacceptable aspects.",M1
18729083,"Changes in MicroRNA expression patterns in human fibroblasts after low-LET <e>radiation</e>.Exposure to radiation provokes cellular responses controlled in part by gene expression networks. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which mostly regulate gene expression by degrading the messages or inhibiting translation. Here, we investigated changes in miRNA expression patterns after low (0.1 Gy) and high (2.0 Gy) doses of X-ray in human fibroblasts. At early (0.5 h) and late (6 and 24 h) time points, irradiation caused qualitative and quantitative differences in the down-regulation of miRNA levels, including miR-92b, 137, 660, and 656. A transient up-regulation of miRNAs was observed after 2 h post-irradiation following high doses of radiation, including miR-558 and 662. MicroRNA levels were inversely correlated with targets from mRNA and proteomic profiling after 2.0 Gy of radiation. MicroRNAs miR-579, 608, 548-3p, and 585 are noted for targeting genes involved in radioresponsive mechanisms, such as cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis. We suggest here a model in which miRNAs may act as  hub  regulators of specific cellular responses, immediately down-regulated so as to stimulate DNA repair mechanisms, followed by up-regulation involved in suppressing apoptosis for cell survival. Taken together, miRNAs may mediate signaling pathways in sequential fashion in response to radiation, and may serve as biodosimetric markers of radiation exposure.",M1

The National University of Singapore (NUS) was officially appointed by IAEA to be the IAEA/NUS Regional Training Centre (RTC) for RCA Member States for training of tissue bank operators on September 18, 1996. In the first five years since its establishment the National University Hospital Tissue Bank concentrated its work on the sterile procurement and production of deep frozen femoral heads and were used in patients for bone reconstruction. The cost of producing these tissues were about SGD$ 250 per femoral head although cost fees were initially charged at SGD$ 50 per femoral head. The most important activity carried out by Singapore within the IAEA was training. Between November 1997 and April 2007, a total of nine courses were conducted by RTC with a total of 180 tissue bank operators registered, 133 from Asia and the Pacific region (13 countries, including 2 from Iran), 14 from Africa (Zambia, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa), 6 from Latin America (Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Peru, and Uruguay), 9 from Europe (Greece, Slovakia, Poland, and Ukraine), and 2 from Australia.

18697627,"Physical basis of adverse and therapeutic effects of low intensity microwave <e>radiation</e>.A physical basis of adverse and therapeutic effects of low intensity microwave radiation is presented based on the concept of oscillatory similitude between the frequency of an external microwave field (together with any lower frequency modulations thereof) and those of certain endogenous dipolar coherent excitations allied to aliveness, which play the role of 'tuned circuits' via which a living organism is electromagnetically sensitised in a non-linear way to external fields too weak to be able to cause heating. From this perspective, an external electromagnetic field affects a living system not as a toxin but rather by perturbing its endogenous electromagnetic activity. The possibility of adverse perturbation is illustrated by reference to the microwave fields used in mobile telecommunications whose signals interfere in a non-thermal way with biofunctionality--in particular, undermining the efficacy of processes that would otherwise afford natural protection against the development of pathology. Therapeutic modalities of microwave exposure, on the other hand, are illustrated using the example of microwave resonance therapy--which can be considered as an electromagnetic version of acupuncture, and as an example of 'quantum medicine'--whose normalising effect on a wide range of pathologies is striking, and which affords a novel alternative to conventional pharmacological interventions.",M1
18696258,"The impact of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) program on <e>radiation</e> and tissue banking in Asia and the Pacific and the Latin American regions.The technical assistance program of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for its member states in the framework of the implementation of its program on radiation and tissue banking focuses on ensuring the availability of quality radiation-sterilised tissue grafts. The IAEA also helps its member states to develop quality control capabilities in order to ensure the safe use of the processed tissues in certain medical treatments. The majority of developing countries does not have such capacity, and must import expensive sterilised tissues from developed countries. The IAEA's core contribution to its program on radiation and tissue banking in Asia and the Pacific and the Latin American regions is a technology for sterilisation by gamma radiation and a training program for tissue bank operators and medical personnel. The Agency develops capabilities for radiation sterilisation of tissue grafts, both for reducing the pre-processing bacterial load, and as a terminal sterilisation process. Sterilising tissue grafts offers a clear advantage in terms of safety. Moreover, compared to alternative sterilisation methods, radiation sterilisation is considered particularly safe in relation to environmental concerns, and the deposition of harmful residuals in the tissue, which occurs for example in the use of chemical such as ethylene oxide gas. Radiation sterilisation, thus, has become the method of choice for an increasing number of tissue banks. Radiation sterilisation of tissue grafts is a critical component in the chain connecting donors to recipients of high quality tissue grafts. Due to this fact, the IAEA has evolved as the only organisation in the UN System with expertise related to tissue banking.",M1
18695298,"Effect of dose metrics and <e>radiation</e> risk models when optimizing CT x-ray tube voltage.We investigated the effect of different CT dose metrics, as well as the implications of various radiation risk models, on the optimization of x-ray tube voltage (kV) in CT. Soft tissue attenuation characteristics and noise levels, obtained from CT scans of a Rando phantom, were used to compute contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) at x-ray tube voltages between 80 and 140 kV. Four CT dose metrics were evaluated: (a) CTDIair, (b) weighted CTDIw, (c) organ dose (Dorgan), and (d) effective dose (E). All doses were obtained using the ImPACT CT Dosimetry software package. Soft tissue CNR was adjusted by the modification of the mAs by assuming that CNR(2) was proportional to mAs. Optimization criteria were: (a) maintaining a constant CNR at each kV and identifying the value that minimizes patient dose; and (b) maintaining a constant dose at each kV and identifying the value that maximizes CNR. We also investigated the implication for optimization strategies assuming that radiation risk is proportional to En, with n varying between 0 and 2. Optimizing with respect to phantom measurements (i.e., CTDIair and CTDIw) could generate results that differed quantitatively and qualitatively from those obtained using patient doses (i.e., Dorgan and E). For head CT scans, 140 kV offered the lowest patient doses as well as the highest CNR, whereas in abdominal scans 80 kV was optimal. Use of an optimal kV for CT imaging over current practice of using 120 kV might reduce patient doses by 10-15%, or improve CNR by 5-10%. Assuming that the risk was proportional to En made no difference to the optimal kV for positive values of n up to 2. We conclude that (a) CT optimization with respect to kV should generally be performed with respect to the patient effective dose, (b) neither CTDIair nor the body CTDIw are appropriate for use in CT optimization, (c) the range of current radiation risk models should not affect the optimal kV value in CT imaging.",M1
18681658,"Quantitative time- and frequency-domain analysis of the two-pulse COSY revamped by asymmetric Z-gradient echo detection NMR experiment: Theoretical and experimental aspects, time-zero data truncation artifacts, and <e>radiation</e> damping.The two-pulse COSY revamped by asymmetric Z-gradient echo detection (CRAZED) NMR experiment has the basic form 90 degrees -Gdelta-t(rec)-beta-nGdelta-t(rec)-FID, with a phase-encoding gradient pulse G of length delta applied during the evolution time tau for transverse magnetization, readout pulse beta, rephasing gradient nGdelta, and recovery time t(rec) prior to acquisition of the free-induction decay. Based on the classical treatment of the spatially modulated dipolar demagnetizing field and without invoking intermolecular multiple-quantum coherence, a new formulation of the first-order approximation for the theoretical solution of the nonlinear Bloch equations has been developed. The nth-order CRAZED signal can be expressed as a simple product of a scaling function C(n)(beta,tau) and a signal amplitude function A(n)(t), where the domain t begins immediately after the beta pulse. Using a single-quantum coherence model, a generalized rf phase shift function has also been developed, which explains all known phase behavior, including nth-order echo selection by phase cycling. Details of the derivations are provided in two appendices as supplementary material. For n&gt;1, A(n)(t) increases from zero to a maximum value at t=t(max) before decaying and can be expressed as a series of n exponential decays with antisymmetric binomial coefficients. Fourier transform gives an antisymmetric binomial series of Lorentzians, where the composite lineshape exhibits negative wings, zero integral, and a linewidth that decreases with n. Analytical functions are presented for t(max) and A(n)(t(max)) and for estimating the maximal percent error incurred for A(n)(t(max)) when using the first-order model. The preacquisition delay Delta=delta+t(rec) results in the loss of the data points for t=0 to Delta. Conventional Fourier transformation produces time-zero truncation artifacts (reduced negative wing amplitude, nonzero integral, and reduced effective T(2) ( *)), which can be avoided by time-domain fitting after right shifting the data by Delta. A doped water sample (9.93 mM NiSO(4), 10 mm sample tube) was used to study the behavior of the CRAZED signal for n=1-4 with beta=90 degrees at 7 T (300 MHz (1)H frequency) as a function of Delta, with and without radiation damping. Pulse-acquire experiments were used to determine the relaxation times (T(1)=61.8 ms and T(2) ( *)=29.7 ms), and the radiation damping time constant T(rd)=18.5 ms. When experimental CRAZED data sets were right shifted by Delta, excellent least-squares fits to the first-order model function were obtained for all n using a minimal set of free variables. Without radiation damping the fitted T(2) ( *)values (29.7-30.2 ms) agreed with the reference value. With radiation damping the fitted effective T(2) ( *) values were 16.2 ms for a 90 degrees pulse-acquire experiment and 18.8-20.2 ms for the CRAZED experiment with n=1-4 and signal amplitudes spanning a range of 10(5).",M1

It is suggested that life span decreasing after irradiation is due to stress-induced premature cell senescence. Life span increasing after irradiation, possibly, is connected with stress-induced activation of FOXO transcription factors, which induce on the basis of stress depth: 1) genes of stress tolerance (MnSOD, catalase, GADD45, p27), 2) apoptosis genes (Bim, FasL). Stress-resistance as well as apoptosis of damaged cells can attenuate aging. In generations of chronic irradiation life span increasing may be due to inbreeding depression removal in populations of laboratory animals.",M1

METHODS: Four academic <e>radiation</e> therapy departments located on the Southeast Coast of China were selected for the study. The survey was conducted on female breast cancer patients who received radiotherapy in 1999 and 2006. The questionnaires were designed to determine the purposes of radiotherapy and to address the postoperative radiotherapy techniques used. The data for these two years were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: The percentage of breast-conserving treatment increased from 3% in 1999 to 13% in 2006, but the percentage of patients treated with postmastectomy radiotherapy dropped from 69% in 1999 to 66% in 2006 (P &lt; 0.05). As regards the changes in techniques from 1999 to 2006, the use of special immobilization devices, treatment planning systems, and CT simulations increased from 46% to 80%, 23% to 70%, and 0% to 14%, respectively (P &lt;0.01). From 1999 to 2006, irradiation of the chest wall following mastectomy increased from 67% to 90%, but for internal mammary irradiation it decreased from 76% to 30% and for the axilla, from 69% to 37% (P &lt; 0.01). There were no obvious differences between 1999 and 2006 on the field design, boost treatment on the tumor bed, or dose prescription. CONCLUSIONS: Breast-conserving treatment was performed more frequently in China in 2006 than in 1999, but postmastectomy radiotherapy did not change a great deal and it was still an essential option. Although the international treatment guidelines have been accepted and implemented by physicians in recent years, prompt improvement in the quality of breast cancer radiotherapy is needed.",M2

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves medical products for use for these specific indications which are part of the medical product's labeling. When medical products are used in a manner not specified in the labeling, it is commonly referred to as off-label use. The practice of medicine allows for this off-label use to treat individual patients, but the ethical and legal implications for such unapproved use can be confusing. Although the responsibility and, ultimately, the liability for off-label use often rests with the prescribing physician, medical physicists and others are also responsible for the safe and proper use of the medical products. When these products are used for purposes other than which they were approved, it is important for medical physicists to understand their responsibilities. In the United States, medical products can only be marketed if officially cleared, approved, or licensed by the FDA; they can be used if they are not subject to or specifically exempt from FDA regulations, or if they are being used in research with the appropriate regulatory safeguards. Medical devices are either cleared or approved by FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Drugs are approved by FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, and biological products such as vaccines or blood are licensed under a biologics license agreement by FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. For the purpose of this report, the process by which the FDA eventually clears, approves, or licenses such products for marketing in the United States will be referred to as approval. This report summarizes the various ways medical products, primarily medical devices, can legally be brought to market in the United States, and includes a discussion of the approval process, along with manufacturers' responsibilities, labeling, marketing and promotion, and off-label use.

20510803,"Prior head and neck <e>radiation</e> exposure is not a contraindication to minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.BACKGROUND: Most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism can have a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy based on localization studies showing single-gland disease. In patients with a history of head and neck irradiation, due to the increased risk of multigland disease and risk of concurrent thyroid cancer, minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is considered by some to be a contraindication. We postulated that previous history of head and neck irradiation should not be a contraindication for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy and tested this hypothesis in a prospective cohort of patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospective database of 491 consecutive parathyroidectomies performed between May 2005 and May 2007 at a tertiary referral medical center. RESULTS: Fifty-two (12.6%) patients had a history of head and neck irradiation and 360 (87.4%) had no exposure to radiation. The 2 groups had no significant difference in terms of gender or ethnicity. The radiation group was older, with an average age of 65.1 years versus 58.1 years (p &lt; 0.0009). There was no significant difference in concurrent benign thyroid neoplasm, thyroid cancer, and type of parathyroid disease (single vs multigland) in the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in the operative approach used between the 2 groups (focused vs unilateral or bilateral). CONCLUSIONS: Head and neck irradiation should not be a contraindication for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of preoperative localization studies showing single-gland disease and no concurrent thyroid neoplasm. Furthermore, history of head and neck irradiation is associated with a later age of presentation for parathyroidectomy.",M2
20494707,"Regional hepatic chemotherapies in the treatment of colorectal cancer metastases to the liver.The liver is the most common site of metastatic spread of colorectal cancer (CRC). Liver may be the only site of spread in as many as 30% to 40% of patients with advanced disease and can be treated with regional therapies directed toward their liver tumors. Surgery is currently the only potentially curative treatment, with a 5-year survival rate as high as 30% to 40% in selected patients. However, fewer than 25% of cases are candidates for curative resection. A number of other locoregional therapies, such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation, cryotherapy, and chemotherapy, may be offered to patients with unresectable but isolated liver metastases. However, for most patients with metastatic spread beyond the liver, systemic chemotherapy rather than regional therapy is a more appropriate option. We review the status of various regional hepatic chemotherapies in the treatment of colorectal metastases to the liver in the light of the available, published prospective, randomized trials; this discipline has not yet been properly applied to the burgeoning use of locally ablative techniques. The regional strategies reviewed include portal venous infusion (PVI) of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), intra-arterial chemotherapy (hepatic arterial infusion [HAI]), chemoembolization, and selective internal <e>radiation</e> therapy (SIRT).",M2

Presence of liver metastases results in significant debilitating hormonal symptoms, and is associated with poor prognosis. Systemic chemotherapy has limited success in the management of patients with NET hepatic metastases. Although somatostatin analogs are effective in controlling symptoms in many of these patients, the disease can become refractory to treatment. For these reasons, interventional radiologic techniques for liver-directed therapy have become an important treatment option in patients with metastatic NETs. Transcatheter arterial procedures such as transarterial embolization (TAE), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and selective internal <e>radiation</e> therapy (SIRT) have been shown to reduce hormone levels, palliate symptoms, and reduce the tumor burden in many patients with unresectable and symptomatic NET hepatic metastases.

METHODS: The medical records of adults who presented to our institution with orbital soft tissue sarcoma between 2003 and 2008 were reviewed. Outcome measures reviewed included response to chemotherapy, type of surgery, length of follow-up, visual acuity at last follow-up, local recurrence, distant metastasis, disease-free interval, and death. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were identified. Nine had primary orbital lesions, 1 had a locally recurrent orbital lesion, 1 had a secondary tumor extending from the paranasal sinuses, and 2 had metastases in the orbit from primary tumors at other sites. Six patients (46%) had chemotherapy, and 10 (77%) had external-beam radiation therapy; 12 patients (92%) underwent surgical resection. The mean follow-up time for all patients was 26 months (range, 2 months -7 years). Three patients (23%) received preoperative chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. Two of these patients underwent globe-preserving surgery, and 1 required an orbital exenteration due to the extent of disease even after chemoreduction. CONCLUSION: Adults with orbital sarcomas may benefit from preoperative chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy.

The trial was terminated early due to poor accrual. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with borderline resectable adenocarcinomas of the pancreas were enrolled. Arm A patients (n = 10) received gemcitabine 500 mg/m(2) IV weekly for 6 weeks, with <e>radiation</e> to 50.4 Gy followed by surgical resection. Arm B patients (n = 11) received preoperative gemcitabine 175 mg/m(2) on days 1, 5, 29, and 33, cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 and 29-32, 5-FU 600 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 and 29-32, followed by radiation with continuous infusion 5-FU 225 mg/m(2) for 6 weeks. All patients received adjuvant gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) weekly x 3 for five cycles. RESULTS: Three patients in arm A, and two patients in arm B were resected. Hematologic toxicity was comparable between the two arms except more patients in arm B developed grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia than those in arm A. Arm B had fewer grade 1-2 GI toxicities although more patients (45%) experienced grade 3-4 GI toxicity.

The authors present a new type of hybrid dosimetric constraint which comprises both volumetric and spatial factors of the dose-distribution. The authors also propose a framework to evaluate these constraints. METHODS: The authors used data from the RT01 prostate radiotherapy trial (ISRCTN 47772397) to derive this set of hybrid constraints for the rectum based on measures extracted from dose-surface maps. For comparison, the authors also derive a set of dose-volume constraints. In order to evaluate these dosimetric constraints, the authors propose a new framework for predicting <e>radiation</e>-induced toxicities using Bayesian logistic regression with high-order interactions. The predictive power of the new RT01-based constraints, as well as of two sets of rectal dose-volume constraints proposed in the recent literature-The constraints proposed by other researchers [C.

Radiol) 20, 15-21 (2008)]--were evaluated using a tenfold cross-validation with follow-up data from the RT01 trial. The predictive power was quantified using receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Toxicities considered were rectal bleeding, loose stools, and a global toxicity score. RESULTS: Dose-volume constraints had less predictive power than the new type of hybrid constraints. A probabilistic model for predicting rectal bleeding based on the dose-volume constraints proposed by other researchers [C. Fiorino, G. Fellin, T. Rancati, V. Vavassori, C. Bianchi, V. C. Borca, G.

Oncol., Biol., Phys. 70, 1130-1137 (2008)], the CHHiP dose-volume constraints, the RT01-based dose-volume constraints, and the hybrid constraints resulted in average areas under the ROC curves of 0.56, 0.58, 0.62, and 0.67, respectively. For predicting loose stools, the corresponding values were 0.57, 0.53, 0.66, and 0.71, respectively. The areas under the respective ROC curves for predicting the global toxicity score were 0.58, 0.55, 0.61, and 0.63. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, imposing the new type of hybrid constraints when generating a treatment plan should result in a reduction in the incidence of radiation-induced late rectal toxicity.",M2
20443497,"GPU-based fast cone beam CT reconstruction from undersampled and noisy projection data via total variation.PURPOSE: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) plays an important role in image guided <e>radiation</e> therapy (IGRT). However, the large radiation dose from serial CBCT scans in most IGRT procedures raises a clinical concern, especially for pediatric patients who are essentially excluded from receiving IGRT for this reason. The goal of this work is to develop a fast GPU-based algorithm to reconstruct CBCT from undersampled and noisy projection data so as to lower the imaging dose. METHODS: The CBCT is reconstructed by minimizing an energy functional consisting of a data fidelity term and a total variation regularization term. The authors developed a GPU-friendly version of the forward-backward splitting algorithm to solve this model. A multigrid technique is also employed. RESULTS: It is found that 20-40 x-ray projections are sufficient to reconstruct images with satisfactory quality for IGRT. The reconstruction time ranges from 77 to 130 s on an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 (NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA) GPU card, depending on the number of projections used, which is estimated about 100 times faster than similar iterative reconstruction approaches. Moreover, phantom studies indicate that the algorithm enables the CBCT to be reconstructed under a scanning protocol with as low as 0.1 mA s/projection. Comparing with currently widely used full-fan head and neck scanning protocol of approximately 360 projections with 0.4 mA s/projection, it is estimated that an overall 36-72 times dose reduction has been achieved in our fast CBCT reconstruction algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: This work indicates that the developed GPU-based CBCT reconstruction algorithm is capable of lowering imaging dose considerably. The high computation efficiency in this algorithm makes the iterative CBCT reconstruction approach applicable in real clinical environments.",M2
20443475,"Confidence intervals in dose volume histogram computation.PURPOSE: Dose volume histograms (DVHs) are used in <e>radiation</e> therapy plan optimization and evaluation. Irradiation strategies are decided at the planning step, and an assessment of the reliability of computed dose distributions and DVHs is needed to ensure that decisions are made based on reliable information. This work describes a method used to assign confidence intervals to DVHs, caused by the uncertainty associated with dose computation. METHODS: A simple mathematical model has been developed, based on several alternative models for point dose uncertainty (rectangular, triangular, and Gaussian probability distributions). The result is an alpha-DVH, to be computed for two a values (0.25/0.75 or 0.10/0.90) to obtain a confidence interval. This method has been applied to several DVH curves. RESULTS: alpha-DVHs are dependent on the point uncertainty probability distribution, on the standard uncertainty, and on the choice of confidence level. Confidence intervals can be assigned either to the volume encompassed by an isodose level or to the dose corresponding to a given volume. CONCLUSIONS: alpha-DVHs provide bounds for DVH values while dose expected volume histograms can be used as central estimates for DVH when uncertainty is taken into account. They are particularly useful when an optimization approach is necessary.",M2
20443474,"Correlation of a hypoxia based tumor control model with observed local control rates in nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy.PURPOSE: To extend the application of current <e>radiation</e> therapy (RT) based tumor control probability (TCP) models of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) to include the effects of hypoxia and chemoradiotherapy (CRT). METHODS: A TCP model is described based on the linear-quadratic model modified to account for repopulation, chemotherapy, heterogeneity of dose to the tumor, and hypoxia. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which parameters exert the greatest influence on the uncertainty of modeled TCP. On the basis of the sensitivity analysis, the values of specific radiobiological parameters were set to nominal values reported in the literature for NPC or head and neck tumors. The remaining radiobiological parameters were determined by fitting TCP to clinical local control data from published randomized studies using both RT and CRT. Validation of the model was performed by comparison of estimated TCP and average overall local control rate (LCR) for 45 patients treated at the institution with conventional linear-accelerator-based or helical tomotherapy based intensity-modulated RT and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the model is most sensitive to the radiosensitivity term alpha and the dose per fraction. The estimated values of alpha and OER from data fitting were 0.396 Gy(-1) and 1.417. The model estimate of TCP (average 90.9%, range 26.9%-99.2%) showed good correlation with the LCR (86.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The model implemented in this work provides clinicians with a useful tool to predict the success rate of treatment, optimize treatment plans, and compare the effects of multimodality therapy.",M2

Between April 2005 and January 2009 patients with schwannomas of VIII (63), V (14) and caudal nerves (2) were treated in Burdenko Moscow Neurosurgical Institute using linear accelerator. Mean age was 49 years (13-82). In 42 cases <e>radiation</e> treatment was preceded by surgical resection. 13 patients had type I or II neurofibromatosis. Mean volume of the tumor was 3.9 cm3 (0.5-14.4 cm3) and 13.4 cm3 (2.8-41.3 cm3) for SRS and SRT, respectively. Mean SRS dose was 12 Gy (10.8-14.4 Gy) for vestibular schwannomas and 15 Gy (13.2-18 Gy) for schwannomas of other nerves. In hypofractionated SRT the dose of 35 Gy was delivered in 7 fractions or 30 Gy in 6 fractions. In cases of classical fractioning total dose of 50-60 Gy was divided into daily fractions of 1.8-2.0 Gy. Radiographic tumor control rate reached 97.5% at the last follow-up. 5 patients experienced trigeminal dysfunction, it was transient in 3 cases and persistent in 2. Permanent decline in House-Brackmann facial nerve scale developed in 2 of 79 patients. After treatment effective hearing (class I-II) was preserved in 7 of 9 patients (67%) who had same level of hearing before SRS. Linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiation treatment provides long-term tumor control associated with high rates of preservation of neurological functions. No further tumor surgery was necessary in 100% of cases with solitary tumors with a minimal follow-up of 5 years.",M2

20426665,"Effect of a topical vasodilator on tumor hypoxia and tumor oxygen guided radiotherapy using EPR oximetry.We sought to reduce tumor hypoxia by topical application of a vasodilator, benzyl nicotinate (BN), and investigated its effect on the growth of tumors irradiated at times when tumor pO(2) increased. EPR oximetry was used to follow the changes in the tissue pO(2) of subcutaneous <e>radiation</e>-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF-1) tumors during topical applications of 1.25-8% BN formulations for 5 consecutive days. The RIF-1 tumors were hypoxic with a tissue pO(2) of 4.6-7.0 mmHg. A significant increase in tumor pO(2) occurred 10-30 min after BN application. The formulation with the minimal BN concentration that produced a significant increase in tumor pO(2) was used for the radiation study. The tumors were irradiated (4 Gy x 5) at the time of the maximum increase in pO(2) observed with the 2.5% BN formulation. The tumors with an increase in pO(2) of greater than 2 mmHg from the baseline after application of BN on day 1 had a significant growth inhibition compared to the tumors with an increase in pO(2) of less than 2 mmHg. The results indicate that the irradiation of tumors at the time of an increase in pO(2) after the topical application of the 2.5% BN formulation led to a significant growth inhibition. EPR oximetry provided dynamic information on the changes in tumor pO(2), which could be used to identify responders and non-responders and schedule therapy during the experiments.",M2

20415056,"An assessment of immediate DNA damage to occupationally exposed workers to low dose ionizing <e>radiation</e> by using the comet assay.BACKGROUND: Several cytogenetic studies have shown an increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations for workers exposed to low dose ionizing radiation, however the dose, type of radiation and management vary among the areas of work; it is possible that this variation may generate different quantity of DNA damage, detectable within the first hours after exposure of the personnel. In this study we assessed early DNA lesions caused by exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation in 41 workers from the departments of Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Radiotherapy and a group of 20 healthy unexposed individuals, all from the same Institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from exposed and unexposed subjects for analysis of DNA damage using the comet assay. The migration of the comet's tail was compared before and after the workday, as well as among the groups; the relationship between DNA migration and the exposure dose of the month was also obtained. RESULTS: A significant increase in damage to DNA was seen after workday for the occupationally exposed group (p &lt; 0.01) as compared with the samples before workday as well as with those from the unexposed group. A positive correlation was found between the monthly dose of radiation and the migration length of DNA before and after the workday (p &lt; 0.01). There were significant differences in the length of the comet tails among workers from different departments: workers from Radiology (28.6 microm) have less DNA damage than those from Nuclear Medicine and Radiotherapy (92.5 microm, 63.4 microm respectively) departments. CONCLUSIONS: All the workers occupationally exposed showed an increase in DNA fragmentation after the workday. The amount of radiation in all three services is different, in Nuclear Medicine and Radiotherapy the workers showed a greater monthly dose of exposure and greater DNA damage than the Radiology workers. The longer tails were observed in Nuclear Medicine where radionuclides are used; these radioactive substances are handled and administered to patients orally or intravenously by the workers, which implies a different type of exposure and radiation, this may explain the differences found in this study. Most of the DNA damage detected by the comet assay is repaired, however a part of it may result in stable chromosomal rearrangements that may represent a long-term health risk. It is important to sensitize exposed workers on their responsibility of working with radiation and the improvement of the hospital safety practices.",M2
20401975,"Advances in radiotherapy of head and neck cancers.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: <e>Radiation</e> therapy plays a key role in the management of head and neck cancers (HNCs). We reviewed the recent advances in radiotherapy of HNCs and the role of imaging in treatment planning. RECENT FINDINGS: As shown in a recent update of meta-analysis of chemotherapy in head and neck cancer (MACH-NC), concurrent chemoradiotherapy was confirmed to be a standard of care in the management of locally advanced HNCs. Two recent large-scale randomized trials [Groupe d'Oncologie Radiothérapie Tête et Cou (GORTEC) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)] failed to show additional benefit when combining accelerated radiotherapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Updated 5-year results of a phase III pivotal trial confirmed the benefit of targeting epidermal growth factor receptor with cetuximab when combined with radiotherapy. Taxane-platinum-fluorouracil-based induction chemotherapy has been established as a reference induction regimen and has been explored as a possible part of the treatment of locally advanced HNCs, which was particularly successful in larynx preservation. The superiority of intensity-modulated radiation therapy compared with conventional radiotherapy for parotid protection has been shown in a prospective phase III trial. PET-based treatment planning is still to be validated in the HNCs. SUMMARY: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy could still be considered as a standard of care; several new treatment combinations and new radiation technologies have been recently successfully evaluated in clinical trials.",M2
20393294,"Classification and treatment of <e>radiation</e> maculopathy.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Radiation maculopathy is a sight-limiting consequence of radiotherapy in the management of uveal melanoma and other intraocular tumors. In this review, we consider clinical, fluorescein angiographic and optical coherence tomographic findings, propose a classification for radiation maculopathy and discuss the management of this condition. RECENT FINDINGS: Radiation macular edema (RME) can be classified by optical coherence tomography into noncystoid or cystoid edema, with foveolar or extrafoveolar involvement. Optical coherence tomographic grading of RME has been found to correlate with visual acuity. Focal argon laser might have some limited benefit in the treatment of RME. Intravitreal triamcinolone and intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor agents can be of short-term benefit in the treatment of RME. In a randomized controlled trial, periocular triamcinolone significantly reduced rates of RME and vision loss up to 18 months following plaque radiotherapy for uveal melanoma. SUMMARY: Currently, there is no proven treatment for established RME, though periocular triamcinolone has been shown to have a preventive benefit. An accepted classification system for radiation maculopathy would be of benefit in planning and comparing future treatment trials.",M2

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of 63 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic neuroblastoma treated at our institution (1989-2001) to investigate their characteristics at presentation, dose and field of RT, treatment response, and failure patterns. RESULTS: Seventeen patients received RT, and 46 did not. In the RT group, a greater percentage of patients had residual disease before consolidation than did those in the no-RT group (88.2% vs 69.6%, P = .008). Gross total resection was achieved less often in the RT group (65% vs 89%, P = .055), but the 5-year cumulative incidences of local failure were similar (35.3% +/- 12.4% vs 32.6% +/- 7.1%). Although there was no difference in 5-year event-free survival, overall survival was better in the no-RT group (47.8% +/- 7.2% vs 23.5% +/- 9.2%, P = .026). CONCLUSION: The addition of RT to the therapy of a group of patients with more residual locoregional disease appeared to improve the local failure rate to approximately that of patients with less residual disease. Radiotherapy may provide even greater benefit to those with less residual disease before consolidation.",M2

Given the number of risk factors common to both heart disease and cancer, it is not uncommon for several of these patients to present for radiation therapy treatment each year. A systematic review was conducted using online databases Medline and Scopus. Results were grouped into in vitro and in vivo studies. In 1994, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) defined guidelines for the management of these patients, which have since been adopted by many radiation oncology departments internationally. More recently, a number of studies have reported an increase in radiation sensitivity of these devices (encompassing the coiled metal leads and generator unit) due to the incorporation of complementary metal oxide semiconductor circuitry. Further avenues of device failure, such as the effect of dose rate and scatter radiation, have only more recently been investigated. There are also the unexplored avenues of electromagnetic interference on devices when incorporating newer treatment technologies such as respiratory gating and intensity modulated radiation therapy.

20354283,"A hybrid strategy of offline adaptive planning and online image guidance for prostate cancer radiotherapy.Offline adaptive radiotherapy (ART) has been used to effectively correct and compensate for prostate motion and reduce the required margin. The efficacy depends on the characteristics of the patient setup error and interfraction motion through the whole treatment; specifically, systematic errors are corrected and random errors are compensated for through the margins. In online image-guided <e>radiation</e> therapy (IGRT) of prostate cancer, the translational setup error and inter-fractional prostate motion are corrected through pre-treatment imaging and couch correction at each fraction. However, the rotation and deformation of the target are not corrected and only accounted for with margins in treatment planning. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the offline ART strategy is necessary for an online IGRT protocol and to evaluate the benefit of the hybrid strategy. First, to investigate the rationale of the hybrid strategy, 592 cone-beam-computed tomography (CBCT) images taken before and after each fraction for an online IGRT protocol from 16 patients were analyzed. Specifically, the characteristics of prostate rotation were analyzed. It was found that there exist systematic inter-fractional prostate rotations, and they are patient specific. These rotations, if not corrected, are persistent through the treatment fraction, and rotations detected in early fractions are representative of those in later fractions. These findings suggest that the offline adaptive replanning strategy is beneficial to the online IGRT protocol with further margin reductions. Second, to quantitatively evaluate the benefit of the hybrid strategy, 412 repeated helical CT scans from 25 patients during the course of treatment were included in the replanning study. Both low-risk patients (LRP, clinical target volume, CTV = prostate) and intermediate-risk patients (IRP, CTV = prostate + seminal vesicles) were included in the simulation. The contours of prostate and seminal vesicles were delineated on each CT. The benefit of margin reduction to compensate for both rotation and deformation in the hybrid strategy was evaluated geometrically. With the hybrid strategy, the planning margins can be reduced by 1.4 mm for LRP, and 2.0 mm for IRP, compared with the standard online IGRT only, to maintain the same 99% target volume coverage. The average relative reduction in planning target volume (PTV) based on the internal target volume (ITV) from PTV based on CTV is 19% for LRP, and 27% for IRP.",M2

We wanted to determine if the improvement in dysphagia was a result of decreased complaints of xerostomia and increased saliva production, since one of our first patients being treated with E-stim noticed a significant improvement in xerostomia. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective trial to determine the effects of E-stim by evaluating saliva production and dysphagia questionnaires instituted by our speech pathologists on head and neck cancer patients that had received radiotherapy (XRT) and were to undergo E-stim for dysphagia. METHODS: Prior to the initiation of E-stim and one to two months after E-stim, saliva samples were collected and patients were asked to answer a Dysphagia and Xerostomia Index Questionnaire. All patients received E-stim two to four months after completing XRT. Patients received three E-stim treatments per week for a total of one to two months. Four electrodes were placed along anterior neck over pharyngeal muscles. E-stim was initiated using four to 30mA at 80-100 pulse-widths. RESULTS: Five patients that received either postoperative <e>radiation</e> therapy or concomitant chemoradiotherapy had been treated with E-stim. All five patients noticed a significant improvement in dysphagia. Five out of five patients noticed a definite increase in saliva production with symptoms of decreased intake of water with meals, sleeping longer hours at night, and increased moistness of lips. CONCLUSION: E-stim therapy appears to be an effective and approved treatment for dysphagia. Our study shows that it may also be beneficial for xerostomia in the post-irradiated head and neck cancer patients. SIGNIFICANCE: To determine if E-stim will benefit the previously irradiated patient with dysphagia and xerostomia.",M2

Multivariate analysis of histologic types of primary, high-grade radiation-associated and sporadic STSs showed that RAS was associated with a worse DSS (hazard ratio, 1.7; range, 1.1 to 2.4; P = .007). For pleomorphic MFH-the most common RAS type-the 5-year DSS was 44% versus 66% in a matched cohort of sporadic MFH patients (P = .07). DSS was significantly worse in primary RAS malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) compared with unmatched sporadic MPNSTs (P = .001). CONCLUSION Histologic type, margin status, and tumor size are the most important independent predictors of DSS in patients with RASs. DSS in patients with primary RAS is significantly worse compared with sporadic STS independent of sarcoma histologic type.",M2

20305334,"Out-of-field photon dose following removal of the flattening filter from a medical accelerator.The aim of this paper is to determine the effect of removing the flattening filter from a linear accelerator on the out-of-field photon dose. A Monte Carlo model was used to simulate 6 MV and 18 MV photon beams from a Varian 2100 accelerator with the flattening filter in place and with it removed. The out-of-field photon doses and composition (head leakage, patient scatter and collimator scatter) were calculated from square open fields in a water tank as a function of distance from central axis, field size and depth. The out-of-field doses resulting from intensity-modulated <e>radiation</e> therapy to the prostate at 6 MV were also calculated, with and without the flattening filter, to sensitive organs in an anthropomorphic Rando phantom. Removal of the flattening filter reduced the out-of-field dose near the treatment field (&lt;3 cm from the field edge) because of decreased collimator scatter. It increased the out-of-field dose at intermediate distances from the field edge (3-15 cm) because of increased patient scatter. At greater distances, the out-of-field dose was decreased because of reduced head leakage. For the clinical treatment examined, the out-of-field dose was generally reduced following removal of the flattening filter, particularly at large distances from the treatment field. Removal of the flattening filter may be advantageous by reducing the out-of-field dose to the patient. This could contribute to reducing the long-term risk of secondary malignancies. In general, however, the out-of-field dose depends on treatment and patient parameters, and a reduction may not always be achievable.",M2
20302652,"Effects of external irradiation of the neck region on intima media thickness of the common carotid artery.BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is increased after radiotherapy (RT) to the head and neck. However, further studies are needed to define the exact mechanism of <e>radiation</e>-induced injury in large vessels, investigate the relationship between radiation dose and large vessel injury and evaluate the rate of progress of atherosclerosis in irradiated vessels. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether external irradiation to the carotid area has any effect on IMT of the common carotid artery in a group of patients who received RT vs control group matched for age, gender and race. METHODS: We studied 19 patients (10 male; 47.8 +/- 17.4 years) during a 5-month period (January 2009-July 2009); they had completed RT with a mean of 2.9 years before (range: 1 month-6 years) The mean radiation dose to the neck in the irradiated patients was 41.2 +/- 15.6 Gy (range: 25-70 Gy). Common carotid IMT was measured with echo-color Doppler. Nineteen healthy adult patients (10 male; 47.8 +/- 17.6) were recruited as a control group. RESULTS: IMT was not significantly higher in patients when compared to the control group (0.59 +/- 0.16 vs 0.56 +/- 0.16 mm, p = 0.4). There was no significant difference between the two groups in relation to the absence (p = 0.7) or presence (p = 0.6) of vascular risk factors. Although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1), the irradiated young patients (age &lt; or = 52 years) had IMT measurements higher (0.54 +/- 0.08 mm) than the non-irradiated young patients (0.49 +/- 0.14 mm). The mean carotid IMT increased with increasing doses of radiation to the neck (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This study shows that increased IMT of the common carotid artery after RT is radiation-dose-related. Therefore it is important to monitor IMT, which can be used as an imaging biomarker for early diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease in patients who have had radiotherapy for treatment of cancer of the head and neck and who are at increased risk for accelerated atherosclerosis in carotid arteries.",M2
20299738,"<e>Radiation</e> therapy: state of the art and the future.Technical innovation in radiation therapy (RT) such as stereotactic irradiation, intensity modulated RT, image-guided RT, and brachytherapy using remote controlled after-loading system have made it possible to deliver ideally distributed radiation dose to the target with great accuracy, while sparing the adjacent organs at risk. As a result, tumor control rate by RT improved markedly and became excellent alternative to surgery for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic brain tumors, early stage lung cancer, and low-risk prostate cancer. In locally advanced stage of cancer, randomized controlled trials established the chemoradiation therapy as a standard treatment option for patients with head and neck cancer, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and cervical cancer. RT is also a valuable treatment for palliation of local symptoms caused by cancer with consistently high response rates. Minimally invasive therapy has come to be emphasized its needs in the background of increased tendency of elderly patients with cancer, and advances in conformal dose delivery technique raise the RT at a more important position in cancer therapy. However, adequate number of RT profession is indispensable to utilize highly-sophisticated RT technology. Substantiality of an education system for radiation oncologist, RT technologist, and medical physicists is our current most important issue.",M2

SETTING AND DESIGN: Randomized placebo control study in the Department of <e>Radiation</e> Oncology of a teaching hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with high-grade gliomas were treated with surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and concomitant paclitaxel. Patients were randomized to receive either oral lycopene (Group A) 8 mg daily with radiotherapy or placebo (Group B). Pre-and post-radiotherapy plasma lycopene levels were measured using high-precision liquid chromatography. McDonald's criteria were used for response assessment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomograph (SPECT) were done three-monthly for two visits and six-monthly thereafter. Primary endpoint was response at six months post radiotherapy. Statistical Analysis Used : The data was analyzed using SPSS Software v10.0 (SPSS corporation Chicago IL) by applying Student's t-test, ANOVA F test, Chi-square test and Karl Pearson Correlation Coefficient. RESULTS: Median age was 38 years. The commonest histology was glioblastoma multiforme (n = 32). Pre- and post-treatment plasma lycopene levels in the patients in Gropu A were 152 ng/ml and 316 ng/ml and in the patients in Group B were 93 ng/ml and 98 ng/ml (P = 0.009). There was non-significant differences in favor of lycopene between Group A and Group B with higher overall response at six months (P = 0.100), response at last follow-up (P = 0.171) and time to progression (40.83 vs. 26.74 weeks, P = 0.089)., The follow-up duration was significantly higher for Group A than Group B (66.29 vs. 38.71 weeks, P = 0.05).

20224732,"Small cell carcinoma of the brain without extracranial involvement by serial CT, MRI and PET.The author reports herein a case of small cell carcinoma of the brain without extracranial tumors by serial imaging modalities. A 75-year-old man presented with headache. Brain CT and MRI revealed a solitary cystic tumor (5 x 6 x 7 cm) in the left occipital lobe. Blood laboratory test revealed no significant findings. Preoperative diagnosis was a primary or metastatic brain tumor. Preoperative systemic examinations including CT, MRI and PET revealed no extracranial tumors. Tumorectomy was performed. Pathologically, the tumor was small cell carcinoma positive for four types of pancytokeratins, cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK 18, thyroid transcriptional factor-1 (TTF-1), CD56, chromogranin, synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase, p53 protein, KIT, PDGFRA, and Ki-67 antigen (labeling = 100%). It was negative for high molecular weight CK, CK5/6, CK14, CK19, CK20, PE10, epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, CEA, desmin, S100 protein, CA19-9, alpha-smooth muscle actin, CD34, p63, and CD68. The pathologic examination strongly suggested primary small cell lung carcinoma. However, repeated serial imaging modalities including systemic CT, MRI and PET revealed no extracranial tumors. The serial sputum cytology was always negative. The patient was treated with <e>radiation</e> and cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and no tumors were found seven months after the operation. The present case suggests that there are small cell carcinomas with a solitary brain metastasis without a radiologically detected primary site.

20216313,"Challenges of integrating chemotherapy and targeted therapy with <e>radiation</e> in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The curative treatment of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer has advanced greatly in recent years, with the establishment of standard of care indications for chemoradiation (CRT). At the same time, there have been advances in each modality, including intensity-modulated radiation therapy, sequential chemotherapy and more tailored combination therapies. However, with new therapies come new challenges. This review will discuss some of the novel approaches to treating head and neck squamous cell cancer, particularly the introduction of biological agents into treatment paradigms, and some of the challenges arising as the field advances. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of recent clinical trials have focused on reducing the disadvantages of concurrent CRT, specifically acute toxicity, lack of compliance and potential for late effects affecting quality of life and function. In particular, the use of biological agents as radiosensitizers has led to the investigation of new combination therapies, such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors administered concurrently with CRT. These new therapies have potential for improving overall survival and lowering locoregional recurrence rates. SUMMARY: Combination therapies hold promise for improving outcomes of patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer, both human papilloma virus-associated and human papilloma virus-negative tumors. The introduction of intensity modulated radiation therapy and biological agents into CRT treatment approaches may reduce some of the disadvantages of more traditional radiation and CRT treatments. Although many challenges remain, the possibility of improving survival with reduced toxicity through treatment selection based on risk stratification and prognostic biomarkers is incrementally evolving.",M2
20209618,"Pelvic radiotherapy and the risk of secondary leukemia and multiple myeloma.BACKGROUND: Although several studies had examined secondary malignancies in patients with specific primary tumor types, to the authors' knowledge there are very few data examining the long-term sequelae of pelvic <e>radiation</e> as a whole. The goal of the current study was to examine the risk of treatment-associated leukemia and multiple myeloma in patients treated with pelvic radiotherapy. METHODS: Patients with invasive tumors of the vulva, cervix, uterus, anus, and rectosigmoid treated from 1973 to 2005 and recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were analyzed. Patients were stratified based on receipt of pelvic radiotherapy. The incidence of secondary leukemia (except chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and multiple myeloma were examined. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to examine the association between pelvic radiation and the development of subsequent hematologic malignancies. RESULTS: A total of 199,268 individuals, including 66,896 (34%) who received pelvic radiotherapy and 132,372 (66%) not treated with radiation, were identified. In a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for other risk factors, post-treatment leukemia was increased by 72% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.72; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.37-2.15) in the patients who received pelvic radiotherapy. The risk of secondary leukemia peaked at 5 to 10 years after primary treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.40-2.44) and remained elevated even 10 to 15 years after initial treatment (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.03-2.18). There was no significant association between radiation and the development of multiple myeloma (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.81-1.44).

20200431,"Long-term mortality from second malignant neoplasms in 5-year survivors of solid childhood tumors: temporal pattern of risk according to type of treatment.BACKGROUND: The temporal pattern in mortality from late second malignant neoplasms in solid childhood cancer survivors, according to the type of treatment, has not been investigated in detail. METHODS: We studied 4,230 5-year survivors of solid childhood cancer diagnosed between 1942 and 1986 in France and the United Kingdom. Complete clinical, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy data were recorded and the integral <e>radiation</e> dose was estimated for 2,701 of the 2,948 patients who had received radiotherapy. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 28 years, 134 fatal events were due to second malignancies, compared with the 13.3 expected from the general France-UK population rates. The standardized mortality ratio was of a similar magnitude after radiotherapy alone and chemotherapy alone and higher after both treatments. The standardized mortality ratio decreased with follow-up, whereas the absolute excess risk increased significantly over a period of at least 25 years after the first cancer. This temporal pattern was similar after chemotherapy alone, radiotherapy alone, or both treatments. We observed a similar long-term temporal pattern among survivors who had died of a second malignant neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract and breast. Survivors who had received a higher integral radiation dose during radiotherapy were at a particularly high risk, as well as those who had received alkylating agents and epipodophyllotoxins. CONCLUSIONS: Five-year survivors of childhood cancer run a high long-term mortality risk for all types of second malignant neoplasms whatever the treatment received and require careful long-term screening well beyond 25 years after the diagnosis.",M2
20173512,"Metastases to the craniovertebral junction.OBJECTIVE: This study reviews the relevant literature regarding the management of craniovertebral junction (CVJ) metastases. These rare tumors present significant diagnostic and treatment challenges. METHODS: A PubMed search of cervical spine, cervical spine metastasis, craniovertebral junction, atlantoaxial spine, and metastasis <e>radiation</e> was conducted to define the epidemiology, imaging, and treatment protocols in the management of metastatic CVJ tumors. RESULTS: CVJ tumors represent less than 1% of spinal metastases, and the literature is limited to small case series. CVJ tumors present with flexion, extension, and rotational pain, often associated with occipital neuralgia. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most sensitive imaging modality for the detection of spinal metastases, but plain x-rays, computed tomography, and [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose play a role in diagnosis and management. Conventional external beam radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery effectively treat the majority of patients with normal spinal alignment or minimal fracture subluxations. Surgery should be considered in patients with fracture subluxations greater than 5 mm, or 3.5 mm subluxation with 11-degree angulation. The palliative goals for surgery favor posterior approaches only including laminectomy for decompression, without the need for anterior approaches with the associated morbidity. Occipitocervical instrumentation using screw-rod systems are effective for irreducible subluxations, but posterior strategies using C1-C2 or C1-C3 can be used for patients with reducible subluxations. CONCLUSION: Effective management of CVJ tumors using radiation and/or surgery results in significant pain and functional improvement in properly selected patients. Advanced surgical techniques and stereotactic radiation may improve outcomes with less morbidity.",M2

20191284,"A systems biology approach to <e>radiation</e> therapy optimization.During the last 20 years, the field of cellular and not least molecular radiation biology has been developed substantially and can today describe the response of heterogeneous tumors and organized normal tissues to radiation therapy quite well. An increased understanding of the sub-cellular and molecular response is leading to a more general systems biological approach to radiation therapy and treatment optimization. It is interesting that most of the characteristics of the tissue infrastructure, such as the vascular system and the degree of hypoxia, have to be considered to get an accurate description of tumor and normal tissue responses to ionizing radiation. In the limited space available, only a brief description of some of the most important concepts and processes is possible, starting from the key functional genomics pathways of the cell that are not only responsible for tumor development but also responsible for the response of the cells to radiation therapy. The key mechanisms for cellular damage and damage repair are described. It is further more discussed how these processes can be brought to inactivate the tumor without severely damaging surrounding normal tissues using suitable radiation modalities like intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or light ions. The use of such methods may lead to a truly scientific approach to radiation therapy optimization, particularly when invivo predictive assays of radiation responsiveness becomes clinically available at a larger scale. Brief examples of the efficiency of IMRT are also given showing how sensitive normal tissues can be spared at the same time as highly curative doses are delivered to a tumor that is often radiation resistant and located near organs at risk. This new approach maximizes the probability to eradicate the tumor, while at the same time, adverse reactions in sensitive normal tissues are as far as possible minimized using IMRT with photons and light ions.",M2

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with H&amp;N epithelial cancer were recruited to this study. All patients received radiotherapy to the H&amp;N region, with doses ranging from 50-70 Gy. Chemotherapy with cisplatin, carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil and taxanes was given to high-risk patients, using standard chemotherapy protocols. Patients were evaluated for mucositis according to WHO common toxicity criteria, and blood samples were drawn for inflammatory (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokine levels before and during treatment. RESULTS: A positive correlation was found between IL-6 serum levels and severity of mucositis and dysphagia; specifically, high IL-6 levels at week 2 were correlated with a need for PEG tube installation. A seemingly contradictory correlation was found between low IL-8 serum levels and a need for a PEG tube.

We examine whether bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can correct the POF induced by <e>radiation</e> and also address whether allogeneic ovarian transplantation (OT) can modulate the adverse effects of radiotherapy. METHODS: Eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were lethally irradiated with 6 Gy x2, and then injected with allogeneic bone marrow cells into their bone marrow cavity using our previously described intrabone marrow (IBM)-BMT technique. Allogeneic ovaries were simultaneously transplanted under the renal capsules of the mice. RESULTS: Three months after the transplantation, we noted that hematopoietic and lymphoid cells had been successfully reconstituted. The ovaries transplanted under the renal capsules demonstrated signs of development with a large number of differentiating follicles at different stages of development. Importantly, the total bone mineral density of the tibia in the  IBM-BMT+OT  (BMT/OT) group remained normal. However, the reproductive function of the recipient mice was not restored, despite the presence of many immature oocytes in the host ovaries in the BMT/OT group. In the BMT group, no oocytes were found in the host ovaries.

Twenty-five patients, aged 7.6-44.7 years (median 13.8 years) at ASCR, were treated. Three (12%) died of treatment-related toxicities within 30 days of ASCR, due to multiorgan system failure (n = 2) and aspergillus infection with veno-occlusive disease (n = 1). Tumor recurred in 16 at a median of 8.5 months (range 2.3-58.5 months). Six are event-free survivors at a median of 151.2 months post-ASCR (range 127.2-201.6 months). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median overall survival is 26.8 months (95% CI: 11.9-51.1 months) and of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival are both 24% (95% CI: 9.8%-41.7%) at 10 years post-ASCR.

RESULTS: Overall (grade I-IV) as well as higher grade (III and IV) diarrhea was found to be significantly increased in the morning arm as compared with the evening arm (overall: 87.39 % vs 68.18 %, P &lt; .01; higher grade: 14.29% vs 5.45%, P &lt; .05). Other radiation-induced toxicity was also higher in the morning arm, but its occurrence in the 2 arms did not differ significantly (13.45% vs 12.73%, P &gt; .05). After completion of treatment, patients' response to radiation in the 2 arms was similar (P &gt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: The significant difference in the incidence of higher grade diarrhea between the morning and evening arms is indirect evidence of the influence of circadian rhythm on the intestinal mucosa of the human intestine. This knowledge may facilitate treating patients with decreased toxicity to the intestinal mucosa.",M2
20160685,"Establishing <e>radiation</e> therapy treatment planning effects involving implantable pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.Recent improvements to the functionality and stability of implantable pacemakers and cardioverter-defibrillators involve changes that include efficient battery power consumption and radiation hardened electrical circuits. Manufacturers have also pursued MRI-compatibility for these devices. While such newer models of pacemakers and cardioverter-defibrillators are similar in construction to previously marketed devices - even for the recent MRI-compatible designs currently in clinical trials - there is increased interest now with regard to radiation therapy dose effects when a device is near or directly in the field of radiation. Specifically, the limitation on dose to the device from therapeutic radiation beams is being investigated for a possible elevation in limiting dose above 200 cGy. We present here the first-ever study that evaluates dosimetric effects from implantable pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in high energy X-ray beams from a medical accelerator. Treatment plan simulations were analyzed for four different pacemakers and five different implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and intercompared with direct measurements from a miniature ionization chamber in water. All defibrillators exhibited the same results and all pacemakers were seen to display the same consequences, within only a +/- 1.8% deviation for all X-ray energies studied. Attenuation, backscatter, and lateral scatter were determined to be -13.4%, 2.1% and 1.5% at 6 MV, and -6.1%, 3.1% and 5.1% at 18 MV for the defibrillator group. For the pacemaker group, this research showed results of -15.9%, 2.8% and 2.5% at 6 MV, and -9.4%, 3.4% and 5.7% at 18 MV, respectively. Limited results were discovered from scattering processes through computer modeling. Strong verification from measurements was concluded with respect to simulating attenuation characteristics. For IP and ICD leads, measured dose changes were less than 4%, existing as attenuation processes only, and invariant with regard to X-ray energy.",M2

20160359,"Survey of patient dosimetry for head and neck cancer patients undergoing external radiotherapy treatment: a study from northeastern hospitals of India.AIM: To study dosimetry of patients during the external radiotherapy of head and neck cancers from different hospitals of the northeastern region (NER) of India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 35 confirmed cases of head and neck cancers reporting to three different hospitals in the NER of India who underwent <e>radiation</e> treatment were the materials for the study. Dosimetry was carried out at 8(eight) anatomical points to these patients, namely, target (entrance and exit points), forehead, chest, abdomen, gonad, arm, and leg respectively by thermoluminescence (TL) as well as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeters. Unlike conventional appliances, we used common iodized salt as TL/OSL phosphor. RESULTS: Patient dosimetry was found to vary with an average of 1.17 +/- 0.39 Sv at forehead, 1.24 +/- 0.39 Sv at chest, 0.52 +/- 0.13 Sv at gonad to a minimum of 0.26 +/- 0.07 Sv at leg areas when exposed to a cumulative dose of 65 Sv at the target. CONCLUSION: Maximum dose received from a stray radiation is about 1.5 Sv at forehead/chest and dosimetry of patient among the three centers is not significantly different at the 5% level of probability.",M2

20155616,"Lycopene in the prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity of radiotherapy.We conducted a study to investigate if lycopene could reduce gastrointestinal toxicity of abdominal and pelvic <e>radiation</e> in Wistar albino rats. Animals received either a control diet (Group 1), lycopene-supplemented diet (Group 2), control diet and radiation (Group 3), and lycopene-supplemented diet plus radiation (Group 4). In Groups 2 and 4, the rats received 5 mg/kg/day lycopene for 10 days. In Groups 3 and 4, the rats received single fraction 8 Gy abdominal and pelvic radiation (RT) on Day 10. Study endpoints included weight loss, diarrhea, duration of diarrhea, survival, and an oxidative stress marker, plasma level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS). The rats receiving RT only had significantly higher weight loss rate compared to the lycopene plus RT group (P = 0.001). Plasma TBARS levels after RT were also significantly higher in the RT only group compared to lycopene plus RT group (P = 0.001). In conclusion, lycopene supplementation significantly reduced the weight loss and prevented oxidative stress in rats treated with abdominopelvic radiation.",M2
20150687,"Polymer gel dosimetry.Polymer gel dosimeters are fabricated from <e>radiation</e> sensitive chemicals which, upon irradiation, polymerize as a function of the absorbed radiation dose. These gel dosimeters, with the capacity to uniquely record the radiation dose distribution in three-dimensions (3D), have specific advantages when compared to one-dimensional dosimeters, such as ion chambers, and two-dimensional dosimeters, such as film. These advantages are particularly significant in dosimetry situations where steep dose gradients exist such as in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery. Polymer gel dosimeters also have specific advantages for brachytherapy dosimetry. Potential dosimetry applications include those for low-energy x-rays, high-linear energy transfer (LET) and proton therapy, radionuclide and boron capture neutron therapy dosimetries. These 3D dosimeters are radiologically soft-tissue equivalent with properties that may be modified depending on the application. The 3D radiation dose distribution in polymer gel dosimeters may be imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical-computerized tomography (optical-CT), x-ray CT or ultrasound. The fundamental science underpinning polymer gel dosimetry is reviewed along with the various evaluation techniques. Clinical dosimetry applications of polymer gel dosimetry are also presented.",M2
20150684,"Monitoring T2 and ADC at 9.4 T following fractionated external beam <e>radiation</e> therapy in a mouse model.The purpose of this study is to investigate the response of transverse relaxation time (T2) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in human glioma tumor xenografts during and after fractionated radiotherapy. Tumor-bearing mice were divided into four treatment groups (n=6 per group) that received a total dose of 800 cGy of 200 kVp x-rays, given over two or three fractions, with a fraction spacing of either 24 or 72 h. A fifth treatment group received 800 cGy in a single fraction, and a sixth group of mice served as an untreated control. All mice were scanned pretreatment, before each fraction and at multiple points after treatment using a 9.4 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. Quantitative T2 and ADC maps were produced. All treated groups showed an increase in mean tumor ADC, though the time for this response to reach a maximum and return toward baseline was delayed in the fractionated groups. The highest ADC was measured 7 days after the final fraction of treatment for all groups. There were no significant differences in the maximum measured change in ADC between any of the treated groups, with the average measured maximum value being 20.5% above baseline. After treatment, all groups showed an increase in mean tumor T2, with the average measured maximum T2 being 4.7% above baseline. This increase was followed by a transition to mean T2 values below baseline values, with the average measured tumor T2 being 92.4% of the pretreatment value. The transition between elevated and depressed T2 values was delayed in the cases of fractionated therapies and occurred between 3.6 and 7.3 days after the last fraction of treatment. These results further the understanding of the temporal evolution of T2 and ADC during fractionated radiotherapy and support their potential use as time-sensitive biomarkers for tumor response.",M2
20150640,"Late effects of abdominal irradiation in children: a review of the literature.AIM: To comprehensively summarize the most important literature regarding the late effects of radiotherapy to the abdomen in childhood and adolescence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published trials, studies and series were identified using the PubMed database. The key words late effects, late sequelae, child, <e>radiation</e>, radiotherapy, abdomen, kidney, liver, and bowel were used. RESULTS: A dose-volume effect is confirmed for liver irradiation. Radiation with doses &lt;20 Gy to major parts of the liver or higher doses to smaller parts seems to be safe. Kidney function impairment due to radiation is rare in children. Renal sequelae may occur after radiation to the remaining kidney in patients who underwent nephrectomy or who received higher doses to both kidneys. Several reports describe small bowel obstruction as a sequelae of surgery, but radiotherapy seems to be less important. CONCLUSION: Several retrospective reports describe radiation-associated late sequelae in children. However, there is still a lack of sufficient data regarding the characterization of dose-volume effects.",M2
20150378,"MGMT promoter methylation is predictive of response to radiotherapy and prognostic in the absence of adjuvant alkylating chemotherapy for glioblastoma.Hypermethylation of the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) gene has been shown to be associated with improved outcome in glioblastoma (GBM) and may be a predictive marker of sensitivity to alkylating agents. However, the predictive utility of this marker has not been rigorously tested with regard to sensitivity to other therapies, namely <e>radiation</e>. To address this issue, we assessed MGMT methylation status in a cohort of patients with GBM who underwent radiation treatment but did not receive chemotherapy as a component of adjuvant treatment. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 225 patients with newly diagnosed GBM were analyzed via methylation-specific, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction following bisulfite treatment on isolated DNA to assess MGMT promoter methylation status. In patients who received radiotherapy alone following resection, methylation of the MGMT promoter correlated with an improved response to radiotherapy. Unmethylated tumors were twice as likely to progress during radiation treatment. The median time interval between resection and tumor progression of unmethylated tumors was also nearly half that of methylated tumors. Promoter methylation was also found to confer improved overall survival in patients who did not receive adjuvant alkylating chemotherapy. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that methylation status was independent of age, Karnofsky performance score, and extent of resection as a predictor of time to progression and overall survival. Our data suggest that MGMT promoter methylation appears to be a predictive biomarker of radiation response. Since this biomarker has also been shown to predict response to alkylating agents, perhaps MGMT promoter methylation represents a general, favorable prognostic factor in GBM.",M2
20149344,"Lactobacillus species in supragingival plaque in subjects with hyposalivation.The aim of the study was to analyse the frequency of different Lactobacillus species in relation to the pH-lowering potential of the plaque. METHODS: Ten subjects with <e>radiation</e>-induced hyposalivation (RT group) and 10 subjects with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS group) and matched controls with normal salivary secretion were included. Lactobacillus species were selected from their growth on Rogosa agar and identified by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism using HaeIII and HpaII restriction enzymes. RESULTS: Lactobacilli were isolated from 14 subjects (6 RT, 3 pSS, 5 controls). The most prevalent species were Lactobacillus fermentum (7 subjects), Lactobacillus casei (7 subjects) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (6 subjects). L. fermentum and L. casei were the most prevalent species in anterior sites and L. rhamnosus and L. fermentum in posterior sites. In anterior sites, hyposalivated subjects with high Lactobacillus counts had an increased plaque acidogenicity compared to those with low counts. In posterior sites, subjects with high Lactobacillus counts had a lower final pH compared with those with low counts. CONCLUSION: There were large intra- and inter-individual variations in frequencies of Lactobacillus species and Lactobacillus counts, but no specific species could be related to plaque acidogenicity.",M2
20149262,"Maintenance of Sorafenib following combined therapy of three-dimensional conformal <e>radiation</e> therapy/intensity-modulated radiation therapy and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a phase I/II study.BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT)/intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) combined with or without transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has shown favorable outcomes in local control and survival of locally advanced HCC. However, intra-hepatic spreading and metastasis are still the predominant treatment failure patterns. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor with effects against tumor proliferation and angiogenesis. Maintenance Sorafenib would probably prevent or delay the intrahepatic and extrahepatic spread of HCC after radiotherapy, which provides the rationale for the combination of these treatment modalities. METHODS AND DESIGN: Patients with solitary lesion (bigger than 5 cm in diameter) histologically or cytologically confirmed HCC receive TACE (1-3 cycles) plus 3DCRT/IMRT 4-6 weeks later. Maintenance Sorafenib will be administered only for the patients with non-progression disease 4 to 6 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. The dose will be 400 mg, p.o., twice a day. Sorafenib will be continuously given for 12 months unless intolerable toxicities and/or tumor progression. If no more than 3 patients discontinue Sorafenib treatment who experience dose-limiting toxicity after necessary dose modification and delay and/or radiation-induced liver disease in the first 15 enrolled patients, the study will recruit second fifteen patients for further evaluating safety and efficacy of treatment. Hypothesis of the current study is that Sorafenib as a maintenance therapy after combined therapy of 3DCRT/IMRT and TACE is safe and superior to radiotherapy combined with TACE alone in terms of time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in comparison to historical data. DISCUSSION: A recent meta-analysis showed TACE in combination with radiotherapy, improved the survival and the tumor response of patients, and was thus more therapeutically beneficial. In this study, local therapy for HCC is the combination of TACE and radiotherapy. Radiation exposure as a kind of stress might induce the compensatory activations of multiple intracellular signaling pathway mediators, such as PI3K, MAPK, JNK and NF-kB. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was identified as one factor that was increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner after sublethal irradiation of HCC cells in vitro, translating to enhanced intratumor angiogenesis in vivo. Therefore, Sorafenib-mediated blockade of the Raf/MAPK and VEGFR pathways might enhance the efficacy of radiation, when Sorafenib is followed sequentially as a maintenance modality.

We developed a novel approach to deliver intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) during kyphoplasty and report the first treated case. METHODS/RESULTS: 60 year old patient with metastasizing breast cancer under chemotherapy presented with a newly diagnosed painful metastasis in the 12th thoracic vertebra. Under general anaesthesia, a bipedicular approach into the vertebra was chosen with insertion of specially designed metallic sleeves to guide the electron drift tube of the miniature X-ray generator (INTRABEAM, Carl Zeiss Surgical, Oberkochen, Germany). This was inserted with a novel sheet designed for this approach protecting the drift tube. A <e>radiation</e> dose of 8 Gy in 5 mm distance (50 kV X-rays) was delivered. The kyphoplasty balloons (KyphX, Kyphon Inc, Sunnyvale) were inflated after IORT and polymethylmethacrylate cement was injected. The whole procedure lasted less than 90 minutes. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this novel, minimally invasive procedure can be performed in standard operating rooms and may become a valuable option for patients with vertebral metastases providing immediate stability and local control. A phase I/II study is under way to establish the optimal dose prescription.",M2
20148271,"Tentorial meningiomas with special aspect to the tentorial fold: management, surgical technique, and outcome.BACKGROUND: From a surgical perspective, tentorial fold (TF) meningiomas (TFM) are a unique entity of tumors. They involve the supra- and infratentorial space and often are in close contact to the cavernous sinus, cranial nerves, and the mesencephalon. Complete resection is challenging and can be hazardous. We present our experience with this rare tumor entity and demonstrate the surgical outcome related to a topographical classification. METHODS: A retrospective analysis on 21 consecutive patients (female/male ratio 17/4) with meningiomas originating from the TF, who underwent surgery between 1992 and 2005 in our clinic, was performed. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 93 months. The cases were classified according to tumor extension in three different types: type I, TF meningiomas with compression of the brain stem; type II, with extension into the anterior portion of middle fossa; and type III, a combination of type I and II. Depending on tumor location, surgical approaches consisted of pterional (nine cases), subtemporal (nine cases), or combined subtemporal-pterional craniotomies (three cases). We defined transient and persistent operative complications in relation to Simpson grade and TF classification. RESULTS: Tumor size ranged from 1 to 6 cm in diameter, with a median at 2.5 cm. The presenting symptoms of the patients were anisocoria (six cases), diplopia (six cases), ptosis (five cases), hemianopia (four cases), and ataxia (two cases). Extent of tumor resection was Simpson grade II in 19 patients, grade III in one patient, and grade IV in one patient. There was no operative mortality (first 30 days after surgery). The rate of postoperative transient new neurological deficits was found at 9.5%, the rate of permanent at 33%. The neurological deficits at admission recovered in two patients. CONCLUSION: In the majority of patients with TF meningiomas, total resection can be achieved through a pterional, subtemporal, or combined approaches but at a substantial toll in terms of permanent morbidity. Radiotherapy after volume reductive surgery in TFM type II and III and decompression of eloquent anatomical structures with low tolerance of <e>radiation</e> should be considered.",M2

METHODS: Between August 2003 and March 2007, 370 patients with locoregionally advanced NPC were treated with IMRT. Presenting stages were stage IIB in 62, stage III in 197, and stage IVA/B in 111 patients. All patients except for 36 patients with cervical lymphadenopathy of 4 cm or less in diameter received 2 cycles of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Forty-eight patients received cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy as well. RESULTS: With a median follow-up time of 31 months (range 5 to 61 months), the 3-year local control, regional control, metastasis-free survival (MFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 95%, 97%, 86%, 81% and 89%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that both age (&lt; or = 60 vs. &gt;60) and N-classification are significant prognosticators for OS (P = 0.001, hazard ratio [HR] 2.395, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.432-4.003; P = 0.012, hazard ratio [HR] 2.614, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.235-5.533); And N-classification is the only significant predicative factor for MFS (P = 0.002, [HR] 1.99, 95% CI 1.279-3.098). T-classification and concurrent chemotherapy were not significant prognostic factors for local/regional control, MFS, DFS, or OS. Subgroup analysis revealed that concurrent chemotherapy provided no significant benefit to IMRT in locoregionally advanced NPC, but was responsible for higher rates of grade 3 or 4 acute toxicities (50% vs. 29.8%, P &lt; 0.005). No grade 3 or 4 late toxicity including xerostomia was observed. However, two patients treated with IMRT and neoadjuvant but without concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy died of treatment related complications. CONCLUSION: IMRT following neoadjuvant chemotherapy produced a superb outcome in terms of local control, regional control, MFS, DFS, and OS rates in patients with stage IIB to IVB NPC. Effective treatment strategy is urgently needed for distant control in patients diagnosed with locoregionally advanced NPC.",M2
20142603,"Role of cancer treatment in long-term overall and cardiovascular mortality after childhood cancer.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the role of treatment in long-term overall and cardiovascular mortality after childhood cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 4,122 5-year survivors of a childhood cancer diagnosed before 1986 in France and the United Kingdom. Information on chemotherapy was collected, and the <e>radiation</e> dose delivered to the heart was estimated for 2,870 patients who had received radiotherapy. RESULTS: After 86,453 person-years of follow-up (average, 27 years), 603 deaths had occurred. The overall standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 8.3-fold higher (95% CI, 7.6-fold to 9.0-fold higher) in relation to the general populations in France and the United Kingdom. Thirty-two patients had died as a result of cardiovascular diseases (ie, 5.0-fold [95% CI, 3.3-fold to 6.7-fold] more than expected). The risk of dying as a result of cardiac diseases (n = 21) was significantly higher in individuals who had received a cumulative anthracycline dose greater than 360 mg/m(2) (relative risk [RR], 4.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 15.3) and in individuals who received an average radiation dose that exceeded 5 Gy (RR, 12.5 and 25.1 for 5 to 14.9 Gy and &gt; 15 Gy, respectively) to the heart. A linear relationship was found between the average dose of radiation to the heart and the risk of cardiac mortality (estimated excess [corrected] RR at 1 Gy, 60%). CONCLUSION: This study is the first, to our knowledge, to establish a relationship between the radiation dose received by the heart during radiotherapy for a childhood cancer and long-term cardiac mortality. This study also confirms a significant excess risk of cardiac mortality associated with a high cumulative dose of anthracyclines.",M2

The questionnaires included status on basic radiation therapy facilities, human resources and radiation therapy equipment. Journal and statistical data reviews were performed to evaluate the structure of other countries. RESULTS: Radiation oncology facilities have steadily increased for 10 years and reached 60 sites in 2006. Also a steady increase of 1.5 times for linear accelerators, 5.8 times for computed tomography simulators and 3.0 times for radiation treatment planning systems was noted. Meanwhile, cobalt-60 teletherapy units and hyperthermia equipment had steadily deceased for 10 years. The number of human resources has steadily increased for the past 10 years, especially for radiation therapy technologists. However, radiation therapy equipment and human resources per population are relatively low compared with advanced countries.

This study assesses overall survival (OS) after diagnosis between black and white women and examines factors that might correlate with this disparity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical College of Georgia Tumor Registry. Cases included those diagnosed between 1990 and 2005. We analyzed race, stage, age of diagnosis, and treatment received: chemotherapy, <e>radiation</e>, surgery, and hormonal therapy. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine differences in OS. RESULTS: Compared with 670 white women, 489 black women were more likely to be younger, have later-stage disease at diagnosis, and were less likely to have received hormonal therapy. Both groups received similar rates of radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy. Black women had significantly poorer OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.12-1.63). White women had a 5-year OS of 54% compared with 45% in black women (P = .0031). Having received radiation, surgery, or chemotherapy was not associated with OS. White women were more likely to have received hormonal therapy, which had a significant protective effect. However, a stratified analysis (between those who received hormonal therapy and those who did not) showed similar results, whereas black women experienced poorer OS in both strata. CONCLUSION: Black women with breast cancer had a significantly poorer OS compared with white women. White women received more hormonal therapy, which had a protective effect. There were no differences in treatment received regarding radiation, surgery, or chemotherapy, and these treatments were not associated with OS. The reasons for racial disparities in breast cancer OS remain complex.",M2

20130503,"Total vaginal necrosis: a representative example of underreporting severe late toxic reaction after concomitant chemoradiation for cervical cancer.INTRODUCTION: There is paucity of information regarding a late toxic reaction after chemoradiation for locally advanced cervical cancer. We discuss this problem with special consideration to total vaginal necrosis (TVN), an underreported severe late complication of chemoradiation. METHODS: The records of 98 cervical cancer patients who received chemoradiation at the Department of Oncology of the University College London Hospital between January 2004 and May 2008 were reviewed. RESULTS: Eight women (8.2%) developed a severe late toxic reaction. From these, 3 patients (3.1% of the entire cohort and 37.5% of the patients with a severe late toxic reaction), who were 44 to 60 years old, developed a TVN 6 to 18 months after completion of chemoradiation. In all the TVN cases, surgical debridement was necessary to alleviate the symptoms. This was followed by an extensive period (up to 24 months) of consolidation. Heavy smoking (P = 0.022) was found to be a significant contributing factor for TVN. CONCLUSIONS: Total vaginal necrosis is an underreported but serious late complication after chemoradiation and leads to considerable chronic morbidity. Radiologic examinations and biopsies are required to exclude recurrent disease. Microvascular damage from <e>radiation</e> combined with heavy cigarette smoking is likely to be pivotal etiologic factors in the development of TVN. For radiotherapy-induced late toxic effects to step out of the gray area of oncologic literature, the clinical pictures should be reported in a more detailed manner. It might be a promising approach to work out a toxicity scale that combines the existing objectifiable grading systems with subjective quality-of-life assessments.",M2
20128994,"Unconventional nuclides for radiopharmaceuticals.Rapid and widespread growth in the use of nuclear medicine for both diagnosis and therapy of disease has been the driving force behind burgeoning research interests in the design of novel radiopharmaceuticals. Until recently, the majority of clinical and basic science research has focused on the development of 11C-, 13N-, 15O-, and 18F-radiopharmaceuticals for use with positron emission tomography (PET) and 99mTc-labeled agents for use with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

20124841,"The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids.BACKGROUND: Previous reports on the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids have not described clear algorithms for multimodal therapies. This article presents an evidence-based review of previous articles and proposes algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids. METHODS: The methodologic quality of the clinical trials was evaluated, and the baseline characteristics of the patients and the interventions that were applied and their outcomes were extracted. RESULTS: Important factors that promote hypertrophic scar/keloid development include mechanical forces on the wound, wound infection, and foreign body reactions. For keloids, the treatment method that should be used depends on whether scar contractures (especially joint contractures) are present and whether the keloids are small and single, or large and multiple. Small and single keloids can be treated radically by surgery with adjuvant therapy (which includes <e>radiation</e> or corticosteroid injections) or by nonsurgical monotherapy (which includes corticosteroid injections, cryotherapy, laser, and antitumor/immunosuppressive agents such as 5-fluorouracil). Large and multiple keloids are difficult to treat radically and are currently only treatable by multimodal therapies that aim to relieve symptoms. After a sequence of treatments, long-term follow-up is recommended. Conservative therapies, which include gel sheeting, taping fixation, compression therapy, external and internal agents, and makeup (camouflage) therapy, should be administered on a case-by-case basis. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the number of randomized controlled trials over the past decade has greatly improved scar management, although these studies suffer from various limitations. The hypertrophic scar/keloid treatment algorithms that are currently available are likely to be significantly improved by future high-quality clinical trials.",M2
20124829,"Pathogenesis of <e>radiation</e>-induced capsular contracture in tissue expander and implant breast reconstruction.BACKGROUND: Capsular contracture is the main complication in postmastectomy tissue expander and implant breast reconstruction in patients requiring radiotherapy. There is evidence that the wingless signaling pathway plays a central role in the pathogenesis of fibroproliferation in fibromatosis and hyperplastic skin wounds, involving multiple linked events leading to up-regulation of target genes and fibroproliferation. Here, the authors tested their hypothesis that the wingless signaling pathway may also regulate radiotherapy-induced fibroproliferation in capsular tissue around expanders/implants in breast reconstruction. METHODS: Biopsies of the periprosthetic capsule were obtained from patients undergoing bilateral expander breast reconstruction in which one side was radiated and the other side was not radiated. Capsular biopsies were snap-frozen and stored at -80 degrees C for Western blot assays to determine protein content of phospho-glycogen-synthase-kinase-3beta (phospho-GSK-3beta), total GSK-3beta, beta-catenin, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and collagen types I and III (n = three to five patients), normalized to beta-actin. Immunostaining for beta-catenin in radiated and nonradiated capsular tissue was also performed. Slides were scanned and analyzed using Zeiss Mirax Scan. RESULTS: The following protein content levels were significantly (p &lt; 0.01) increased in radiated capsule compared with nonradiated capsule: phospho-GSK-3beta (6.7-fold), total GSK-3beta (3.0-fold), beta-catenin (2.3-fold), COX-2 (2.8-fold), and collagen type I (1.6-fold) and type III (1.8-fold). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated increased fibroblast cytosolic beta-catenin staining and evidence of beta-catenin nuclear translocation in radiated compared with nonradiated capsular tissue. CONCLUSION: Results from this study highlight the importance of the wingless signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced fibroproliferation associated with capsular contracture in expander/implant breast reconstruction.",M2

20123514,"[Sexual dysfunction after curietherapy and external radiotherapy of the prostate for localized prostate cancer]OBJECTIVES: Knowing the importance of sexuality items in the choice by the patient of the modality of treatment of localized prostate cancer, we aimed at reviewing and updating the effects of prostate radiotherapy and brachytherapy on sexual functions. METHOD: A PubMed search was done using the keywords: prostate cancer, erectile dysfunction, radiotherapy, brachytherapy, ejaculation and orgasm. RESULTS: After both radiotherapy and brachytherapy, sexual troubles occur progressively, the onset of occurrence of erectile dysfunction being 12-18 months after both treatments. Even though the pathophysiological pathways by which radiotherapy and brachytherapy result in erectile dysfunction have not yet been fully clarified, arterial damage and exposure of neurovascular bundle to high levels of <e>radiation</e> seem to be two main causes of erectile dysfunction after radiotherapy and brachytherapy. The radiation dose received by the corpora cavernosa at the crurae of the penis may also be important in the etiology of erectile dysfunction. Another important factor following radiotherapy is the treatment modality. Not many data about ejaculation and orgasm after radiation treatments have been published yet. Recent data show that most of the population treated by brachytherapy conserves ejaculation and orgasm after treatment, even if a majority describe reduction of volume and deterioration of orgasm. Patients need to be correctly informed on the possible sequela of radiotherapy and brachytherapy on their sexual well-being while planning their treatment. Patients should also be informed about the possible treatment modalities for erectile dysfunction.",M2
20123510,"[Urological cancers of the elderly subject: the role of radiotherapy]Urologic cancers are now usually found in elderly patients and the value of curative treatment is frequently asked. Life expectancy must not be underestimated with its consequence of undertreatment. Geriatric assessment is a good tool to make the right decision. For bladder and prostatic carcinomas, external beam <e>radiation</e> therapy is often the treatment of choice, if a curative option has been choose, because its toxicity is low in this population. In fact, many retrospectives studies have demonstrated that toxicity is equivalent in young and old patients. In prostate cancer, a recent randomised trial demonstrated that combination of irradiation and hormonal treatment increased biochemical control and overall survival over hormonal treatment alone. Hypofractionated schedules, more convenient to old patients, have been regularly reported for bladder cancers, but new techniques in radiation therapy seem to allow the use of this type of treatment schedules in prostate carcinomas.",M2
20121363,"Malignant transformation of irradiated craniopharyngioma in children: report of 2 cases.Malignant transformation of craniopharyngioma is a rare event; only 3 cases have been reported in children, all in the Japanese literature. The authors describe 2 additional pediatric cases. Treatment in both of these cases consisted of multiple resections and external beam <e>radiation</e> therapy (EBRT). Malignant transformation occurred 7 and 8 years after EBRT. The authors also review another 6 cases in adults. A possible causative association with radiation therapy is discussed. As radiation is currently an important option in the management of craniopharyngiomas, this association requires further study.",M2
20117287,"The rate of secondary malignancies after radical prostatectomy versus external beam <e>radiation</e> therapy for localized prostate cancer: a population-based study on 17,845 patients.PURPOSE: External-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) may predispose to secondary malignancies that include bladder cancer (BCa), rectal cancer (RCa), and lung cancer (LCa). We tested this hypothesis in a large French Canadian population-based cohort of prostate cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Overall, 8,455 radical prostatectomy (RP) and 9,390 EBRT patients treated between 1983 and 2003 were assessed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Three endpoints were examined: (1) diagnosis of secondary BCa, (2) LCa, or (3) RCa. Covariates included age, Charlson comorbidity index, and year of treatment. RESULTS: In multivariable analyses that relied on incident cases diagnosed 60 months or later after RP or EBRT, the rates of BCa (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4; p = 0.02), LCa (HR, 2.0; p = 0.004), and RCa (HR 2.1; p &lt;0.001) were significantly higher in the EBRT group. When incident cases diagnosed 120 months or later after RP or EBRT were considered, only the rates of RCa (hazard ratio 2.2; p = 0.003) were significantly higher in the EBRT group. In both analyses, the absolute differences in incident rates ranged from 0.7 to 5.2% and the number needed to harm (where harm equaled secondary malignancies) ranged from 111 to 19, if EBRT was used instead of RP. CONCLUSIONS: EBRT may predispose to clinically meaningfully higher rates of secondary BCa, LCa and RCa. These rates should be included in informed consent consideration.",M2
20113681,"Dose intensified molecular targeted radiotherapy for cancer-lymphoma as a paradigm.Although most patients with locoregional cancer are cured by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and combinations thereof, those with distant metastases are not despite systemic chemotherapy. These patients respond to local radiotherapy but generally need systemic therapy. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) provides a paradigm for the role of molecular targeted radiotherapy (MTRT) because these patients have multifocal disease in most cases. Although patients with NHL achieve remissions after multiple cycles of chemotherapy, less than one half of those with aggressive NHL are cured and almost none of those with low grade NHL. Furthermore, NHL, like other cancers, becomes chemoresistant, yet remains responsive to radiotherapy. MTRT, <e>radiation</e> targeted by molecules, is a good strategy for the treatment of multifocal and radiosensitive cancers. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is an MTRT approach using MAbs, or parts thereof, to target the radionuclide that delivers radiation. Two anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), one labeled with (111)In for imaging or (90)Y for therapy and a second labeled with (131)I for imaging and therapy, have proven effective and safe for MTRT for NHL patients. The importance of the radiation is demonstrated in the data from the randomized pivotal trial of (90)Y-ibritumomab; response rates were distinctly better in the (90)Y-ibritumomab arm than in the rituximab arm. Furthermore, the efficacy of (131)I-tositumomab was greater than that of the same MAb alone in another pivotal trial. Although hematologic toxicity is dose limiting for MTRT, febrile neutropenia is uncommon. MTRT is also not associated with mucositis, hair loss, or persistent nausea or vomiting, unlike chemotherapy. Randomized trials of MTRT in different strategies have not been conducted, but there is evidence of better outcomes, particularly for strategies that provide dose intensification, such as pretargeted MTRT, multiple dosing ( fractionation ), and MTRT with stem cell transplantation (SCT). Pretargeted RIT separates delivery of the targeting molecule from radionuclide delivery, provides dose escalation, and is more effective than direct one-step RIT, although more complicated to implement. Improved drugs and strategies for MTRT have documented potential for better patient outcomes. Smaller radionuclide carriers, such as those used for pretargeted MTRT, should be incorporated into the management of patients with NHL and other cancers soon after the patients have proven incurable. Expected improvements using better drugs, strategies, and combinations with other drugs seem likely to make MTRT integral in the management of many patients with cancer and likely to lead to cures of NHL.",M2
20113679,"Radioembolization of liver tumors with yttrium-90 microspheres.Radioembolization (RE), also termed selective internal <e>radiation</e> therapy (SIRT), has been gradually introduced to the clinical arsenal of cytoreductive modalities in recent years. There is growing evidence for efficiency in liver tumors of various entities, with the most prominent ones being hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and neuroendocrine tumors. Hepatic metastases of numerous other tumor entities including breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and pancreatic cancer are treatment-sensitive, even when being refractory to other treatment modalities such as bland-embolization, regional, or systemic chemotherapy. The antitumor effect of SIRT is related to radiation rather than embolization, with extraordinary high local radiation doses obtained selectively at the site of viable tumor and little affection of the surrounding normal liver tissue. Morphologic changes after RE may pose difficulties for interpretation in conventional restaging with regard to tumor viability and true response to treatment. Therefore, functional imaging, that is, metabolic imaging with (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (computed tomography) in the majority of treated tumors, is regarded the gold standard in this respect and should be included for pre- and post-SIRT assessment. To prevent serious toxicity to be associated with the potent antitumor efficacy, meticulous pretreatment evaluation is of particular importance. Improvements in predicting dosimetry will help optimize treatment and patient selection. Nuclear medicine procedures are essential for planning, performing, and monitoring of RE. However, the interdisciplinary aspect of patient management has to be emphasized for this particular treatment form. As SIRT is moving forward from the salvage setting indication to the use in earlier stages of hepatic tumor disease and with the advent of new treatment protocols and targeted therapies, embedding SIRT into a multidisciplinary approach will become even more important. This article focuses on procedural and technical aspects for selection, preparation, and performance of treatment as well as post-therapeutic monitoring and response assessment.",M2

However, long-term follow-up documented serious long-term complications due to irradiation of normal tissues. Modern technology makes it possible to very accurately shape the high-dose volume. However, new problems emerge. Organ movement must be managed and the precise definition of the extent of the tumour tissue is crucial. Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are increasingly used. Biological imaging may enable us to image tumour biology more accurately and modify radiation doses accordingly.",M2
