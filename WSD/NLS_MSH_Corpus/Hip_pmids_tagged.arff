20533764,"Efficacy of strontium ranelate on bone mineral density in men with osteoporosis.In an open-label, prospective, controlled, 12-month study the effects of strontium ranelate (SR, CAS 135459-87-9) or alendronate (CAS 129318-43-0) on bone mineral density (BMD) were compared in 152 men with primary osteoporosis. Patients were randomized to SR 2 g/day (n = 76) or alendronate 70 mg/week (n = 76) supplemented daily with 1200 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D. The main outcome measure was percent change in lumbar spine and total <e>hip</e> BMD from baseline. Mean BMD (+/- SD) increased by 5.8 +/- 3.7% at the lumbar spine and 3.5 +/- 2.8% at the total hip with SR compared to increases of 4.5 +/- 3.4 % and 2.7 +/- 3.2%, respectively, with alendronate. Increases in BMD in the SR group are consistent with 1-year results from two pivotal fracture studies in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. SR was associated with a 22% greater increase in BMD at the lumbar spine (p = 0.033) and 23% greater increase at the total hip (p = 0.002) than alendronate. New fractures were observed in 7 SR and 10 alendronate patients. Height loss (-0.1 +/- 0.7 cm) was less with SR compared with alendronate (-0.5 +/- 0.8 cm) (p = 0.026). SR was also associated with significantly greater reductions in back pain and analgesic use scores. Adverse events were experienced by 28 (37%) patients in the SR group and 38 (50%) patients in the alendronate group, none of which were serious. In men with osteoporosis, SR produced significantly greater mean increases in BMD over 12 months compared with alendronate, an agent already approved for male osteoporosis. Mean increases in BMD with SR in men were similar to those previously documented for this agent in postmenopausal women, suggesting that similar benefits on anti-fracture efficacy may be expected.",M1

METHODS: Twelve patients with Seinsheimer type V subtrochanteric femoral fractures were retrospectively analyzed. There were 8 males and 4 females with an average age of 53 years (range 31 to 65 years). Seven cases were caused by traffic accident, 4 cases by falling from hight, 1 case by heavy object. According to the Seinsheimer classification, all the cases were type V fractures. All the cases accepted the surgical treatment with dynamic hip screw and shape memory alloy bow-teeth screw fixation. RESULTS: The mean period of follow-up was 28 months (range 20 to 38 months). All the cases obtained bone union in average 3.3 months (from 3 to 4.5 months). There were no complications such as deep infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and bone nonunion. The results of clinical evaluation according to Merle d'Aubigne scores were 16.75 +/- 1.14 and excellent in 4 cases, good in 8 cases. CONCLUSION: Application of dynamic hip screw and shape memory alloy bow-teeth screw as a superior option can get satisfactory reduction with reliable fixation and will be one of a better choice for fixation of Seinsheimer type V subtrochanteric femoral fractures.",M1

20374022,"Combination of radiological and biochemical methods to assess bone mineral density of mandible in fully edentulous patients after chemotherapy: a 5-year prospective study.BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is of concern in breast cancer patients who are undergoing chemotherapy. This study compared the bone mineral density (BMD) index of the mandible and <e>hip</e> hinge between patients who were undergoing chemotherapy or breast cancer, and fully edentulous Chinese patients without cancer over a period of 5 years. METHOD: 120 fully edentulous patients with an average age of 69 who had undergone mastectomy for grade two or three non-metastatic invasive breast ductal carcinoma. This was followed by administration of 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. The 118 fully edentulous cancer-free patients were included as a control group. The first assessment point was 6 months after chemotherapy treatment. The BMD and panoramic and side views of the mandible were measured by gamma-ray and the BMD of left hip hinge was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The serum and urine level of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), as well as liver and renal function tests were determined. These examinations were performed annually for 5 years. RESULT: The cancer patients demonstrated a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in bone resorption of mandible and hip, and an increase in BAP and ICTP levels when compared with the control group. Although data were collected annually there was no statistical significance for the first 3 years. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy displayed significant resorption of mandibular bones compared with the healthy control, which might result in difficulties in fitting dentures, as it would cause pain and mucosal friction. Thus, concurrent therapy to decrease mandibular bone loss and special considerations in dentures are warranted for these patients.",M1
20370444,"Bone mineral densitometry in patients on hemodialysis: difference between genders and what to measure.INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and osteoporosis are important health problems. There is an interrelationship between osteoporosis and CKD. Bone densitometry is the  gold  standard in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Unfortunately, there are some problems with the interpretation of bone densitometry in CKD patients. The goal of this study was to determine bone mineral density (BMD) in CKD patients, to assess the difference between genders and different sites of bone densitometry correlation between BMD and laboratory parameters, and to assess the most optimal measuring site. METHODS: We studied 134 hemodialysis (HD) patients (62 females, 72 males). The mean age was 56.4+/-12.4 years and the mean duration of HD was 54.4+/-60 months. BMD of the lumbar spine (posterior-anterior projection and lateral projection), <e>hip</e> (femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, total femur, the Ward's Triangle), and forearm (ultradistal (UD), middistal (MID), distal third portion, and total forearm) was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic Delphi apparatus). Values were expressed as BMD, T-score, and Z-score. RESULTS: Females had lower values of BMD in all measurement points. There were no significant differences in T- and Z-scores of forearm between males and females. Age was in a positive correlation with lumbar spine BMD in males and females. There was a negative correlation with neck and forearm BMD in both groups. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) was also in negative correlation with hip and forearm BMD in both groups. The best correlation of BMD in different sites was between forearm and neck. CONCLUSION: BMD data in CKD patients should be interpreted with caution and appendicular skeletal sites should be included in the evaluation.",M1
20367420,"Bone mineral density of the femoral neck in resurfacing <e>hip</e> arthroplasty.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Resurfacing total hip arthroplasty (RTHA) may preserve the femoral neck bone stock postoperatively. Bone mineral density (BMD) may be affected by the hip position, which might bias longitudinal studies. We investigated the dependency of BMD precision on type of ROI and hip position. METHOD: We DXA-scanned the femoral neck of 15 resurfacing patients twice with the hip in 3 different rotations: 15 degrees internal, neutral, and 15 degrees external. For each position, BMD was analyzed with 3 surface area models. One model measured BMD in the total femoral neck, the second model divided the neck in two, and the third model had 6 divisions. RESULTS: When all hip positions were pooled, average coefficients of variation (CVs) of 3.1%, 3.6%, and 4.6% were found in the 1-, 2-, and 6-region models, respectively. The externally rotated hip position was less reproducible. When rotating in increments of 15 degrees or 30 degrees , the average CVs rose to 7.2%, 7.3%, and 12% in the 3 models. Rotation affected the precision most in the model that divided the neck in 6 subregions, predominantly in the lateral and distal regions. For larger-region models, some rotation could be allowed without compromising the precision. INTERPRETATION: If hip rotation is strictly controlled, DXA can reliably provide detailed topographical information about the BMD changes around an RTHA. As rotation strongly affects the precision of the BMD measurements in small regions, we suggest that a less detailed model should be used for analysis in studies where the leg position has not been firmly controlled.",M1
20231745,"Comparison of lower extremity EMG between the 2-leg squat and modified single-leg squat in female athletes.PURPOSE: To compare EMG activity of selected <e>hip</e> and knee muscle groups in female athletes performing a modified single-leg squat and the 2-leg squat using the same relative intensity. METHODS: Eleven Division I female athletes from a variety of sports (soccer, softball, and track) completed the study. EMG measurements were taken as the subjects completed 3 parallel repetitions at 85% of their 3-repetition maximum on each exercise. Mean and mean peak EMG data from the gluteus medius, hamstrings, and quadriceps and the quadriceps:hamstrings EMG ratio were compared between the 2 exercises. RESULTS: Statistically higher mean (P &lt; .01) and mean peak (P &lt; .05) gluteus medius and mean and mean peak (P &lt; .01) hamstring EMG activity occurred during the modified single-leg squat. The 2-leg squat produced higher mean and mean peak (P &lt; .05) quadriceps activity and a higher quadriceps:hamstrings EMG ratio (P &lt; .01). CONCLUSION: Muscle-recruitment patterns appear to differ between the 2 types of squat exercises when performed at the same relative intensity by female athletes.",M1

20208125,"Selective stimulation of the human femoral nerve with a flat interface nerve electrode.In humans, we tested the hypothesis that a flat interface nerve electrode (FINE) placed around the femoral nerve trunk can selectively stimulate each muscle the nerve innervates. In a series of intraoperative trials during routine vascular surgeries, an eight-contact FINE was placed around the femoral nerve between the inguinal ligament and the first nerve branching point. The capability of the FINE to selectively recruit muscles innervated by the femoral nerve was assessed with electromyograms (EMGs) of the twitch responses to electrical stimulation. At least four of the six muscles innervated by the femoral nerve were independently and selectively recruited in all subjects. Of these, at least one muscle was a <e>hip</e> flexor and at least two were knee extensors. Results from the intraoperative experiments were used to estimate the potential for the electrode to restore knee extension and hip flexion through functional electrical stimulation. Normalized EMGs and biomechanical simulations were used to estimate joint moments and functional efficacy. Estimated knee extension moments exceed the threshold required for the sit-to-stand transition.",M1
20206357,"Non-invasive assessment of soft-tissue artifact and its effect on knee joint kinematics during functional activity.The soft-tissue interface between skin-mounted markers and the underlying bones poses a major limitation to accurate, non-invasive measurement of joint kinematics. The aim of this study was twofold: first, to quantify lower limb soft-tissue artifact in young healthy subjects during functional activity; and second, to determine the effect of soft-tissue artifact on the calculation of knee joint kinematics. Subject-specific bone models generated from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used in conjunction with X-ray images obtained from single-plane fluoroscopy to determine three-dimensional knee joint kinematics for four separate tasks: open-chain knee flexion, <e>hip</e> axial rotation, level walking, and a step-up. Knee joint kinematics was derived using the anatomical frames from the MRI-based, 3D bone models together with the data from video motion capture and X-ray fluoroscopy. Soft-tissue artifact was defined as the degree of movement of each marker in the anteroposterior, proximodistal and mediolateral directions of the corresponding anatomical frame. A number of different skin-marker clusters (total of 180) were used to calculate knee joint rotations, and the results were compared against those obtained from fluoroscopy. Although a consistent pattern of soft-tissue artifact was found for each task across all subjects, the magnitudes of soft-tissue artifact were subject-, task- and location-dependent. Soft-tissue artifact for the thigh markers was substantially greater than that for the shank markers. Markers positioned in the vicinity of the knee joint showed considerable movement, with root mean square errors as high as 29.3mm. The maximum root mean square errors for calculating knee joint rotations occurred for the open-chain knee flexion task and were 24.3 degrees , 17.8 degrees and 14.5 degrees for flexion, internal-external rotation and abduction-adduction, respectively. The present results on soft-tissue artifact, based on fluoroscopic measurements in healthy adult subjects, may be helpful in developing location- and direction-specific weighting factors for use in global optimization algorithms aimed at minimizing the effects of soft-tissue artifact on calculations of knee joint rotations.",M1
20203376,"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation of <e>hip</e> adductors improves gait parameters of children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy.BACKGROUND: Reduction of spasticity in hip adductor muscles is one of the essential factors to improve standing, gait, and personal hygiene of children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (CP). Surgical and medical methods have been commonly used for such purposes. These methods are expensive, required special skill and have side effects. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of conventional TENS on spasticity in hip adductors and gait parameters of children with spastic diplegic CP. Subject: An experimental group of twenty seven ambulant children with spastic diplegic CP and control group of fifteen healthy children were voluntary participants in the study. METHODS: The experimental group received two different TENS management programs. The 1st TENS program was a one-time trial management program that included an ongoing application of conventional TENS on bilateral hip adductors during passive hip abduction, and during walking for a pre-determined distance. The 2nd TENS program was a one-week trial management program that included 15 minutes of ongoing application of conventional TENS on bilateral hip adductors during walking, three sessions a day for a week. The effects of the TENS program was assessed using the Modified Ashworth Scale, the balance master system and visual observations of knee positions. RESULTS: A significant improvement was recorded in spasticity of hip adductors, gait parameters and knees position of the experimental group. CONCLUSION: Functional application of TENS to hip adductors of children with spastic diplegic CP can reduce spasticity and improve gait pattern.",M1
20199985,"Effect of soy isoflavone extract supplements on bone mineral density in menopausal women: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.This study was conducted to clarify the effect of ingesting soy isoflavone extracts (not soy protein or foods containing isoflavones) on bone mineral density (BMD) in menopausal women. PubMed, CENTRAL, ICHUSHI, CNKI, Wanfang Data, CQVIP, and NSTL were searched for randomized controlled trials published in English, Japanese, or Chinese reporting the effects of soy isoflavone extracts on lumbar spine or <e>hip</e> BMD in menopausal women. Trials were identified and reviewed for inclusion and exclusion eligibility. Data on study design, participants, interventions, and outcomes were extracted. Eleven, seven, five, and five trials were finally selected for estimation of the effects on spine, femoral neck, hip total, and trochanter BMD, respectively. Meta-analysis including data from1240 menopausal women revealed that daily ingestion of an average of 82 (47-150) mg soy isoflavones (aglycone equivalent) for 6-12 months significantly increased spine BMD by 22.25 mg/cm2 (95% CI: 7.62, 32.89; p=0.002), or by 2.38% (95% CI: 0.93, 3.83; p=0.001) compared with controls (random-effects model). Subgroup analyses indicated that the varying effects of isoflavones on spine BMD across trials might be associated with study characteristics of intervention duration (6 vs. 12 months), region of participant (Asian vs. Western), and basal BMD (normal bone mass vs. osteopenia or osteoporosis). No significant effects on femoral neck, hip total, and trochanter BMD were found. Soy isoflavone extract supplements increased lumbar spine BMD in menopausal women. Further studies are needed to address factors affecting the magnitudes of effect on spine and to verify the effect on hip.",M1
20196182,"Risperidone associated weight, leptin, and anthropometric changes in children and adolescents with psychotic disorders in early treatment.OBJECTIVE: To document prospective weight and anthropometric changes in children and adolescents during the first 12 weeks of treatment with risperidone and evaluate metabolic outcomes including plasma leptin levels. METHOD: Eight patients with psychotic disorders (ages 11-17) who had started risperidone (mean: 1.80 mg/day; sd = 1.04) in the prior 4 weeks participated in this observational study. Fasting morning blood samples were obtained at baseline and week 8 to assess glucose, leptin, cortisol, insulin, and triglycerides. Measures of body mass index (BMI), weight, waist and <e>hip</e> circumference, blood pressure, and heart rate were obtained weekly. RESULTS: Participants increased in mean weight (4.16 kg; sd = 4.36; p = 0.03) and BMI (1.47 kg/m(2); sd = 1.53; p = 0.03) with five out of eight gaining at least 7% of baseline body weight. They had a 4.03 cm (sd = 3.82; p = 0.02) increase in waist circumference and a 5.17 cm (sd = 3.68; p = 0.01) increase in hip circumference. Leptin trended higher, but did not reach statistical significance. There were no significant changes in glucose, insulin, cortisol, blood pressure, or heart rate. CONCLUSION: Subjects experienced significant increases in weight, BMI, hip and waist circumference during the first 3 months of treatment. Better powered research with more advanced anthropometric assessment is warranted to further elucidate mechanisms of antipsychotic associated weight gain in youth.",M1
20175954,"Piriformis syndrome--an attempt to understand its pathology.OBJECTIVE: Gross anatomy of the <e>hip</e> rotators and histology of the sciatic nerves in adult cadavers were studied, aiming to the identification of possible pathologic changes related to the piriformis syndrome (PS). MATERIAL: 50 cadavers were dissected; in 17 cases with macroscopical findings the sciatic nerves were harvested (34 sciatic nerves; 17 cadavers). History of low back or leg pain was not available. METHOD: Site anatomy and additional findings at the harvesting sites were recorded, such as anatomical variations, adhesions, hematomas etc. All nerves were additionally microscopically analyzed. In cases with findings at the dissection, the contralateral unaffected nerves served as controls. All the dissected nerves were conserved in 10% formalin solution, embedded in paraffin, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and immunolabeled with antibodies against Neurofilament (NF). RESULTS: Both the H&amp;E staining as well as the performed immunohistochemistry showed, to a variable degree, significant alterations in the structure of the affected nerves compared to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: These findings both in the local anatomy and sciatic nerve correspond to lesions that are expected in PS. Nevertheless, since this was a cadaveric study, unassociated to a certain pain patient's history, results should be considered and interpreted as an indication of a sciatic nerve injury in PS.",M1
20175650,"Femoroacetabular impingement and classification of the cam deformity: the reference interval in normal <e>hips</e>.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) have a cam deformity, which may be quantified by measuring the alpha angle and anterior offset ratio (AOR). Knowledge of what constitutes a  normal  alpha angle and AOR is limited. We defined the reference intervals of these measurements from normal hips in the general population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 157 individuals from the general population were reviewed clinically and radiographically. 74 individuals with clinical evidence of hip disease or radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis (OA) were excluded, leaving a study group of 83 individuals (mean age 46 (22-69) years, 44 females) with normal hips. The alpha angles and AORs were measured from cross-table lateral radiographs taken in 15 degrees internal rotation. A validation study consisting of a cadaver study and a measurement reliability study was also performed. RESULTS: The mean alpha angle was 48 degrees in men and 47 degrees in women. The mean AOR was 0.19, the same in men and women. Thus, sexes were combined to derive 95% confidence intervals for the population mean alpha angle (46-49 degrees ) and AOR (0.18-0.20). The 95% reference interval for the alpha angle was 32-62 degrees degrees, and for the AOR it was 0.14-0.24. The validation study confirmed that these measurements were resistant to a reasonable degree of variation in positioning and that the repeatability and reproducibility of the measurements was good. INTERPRETATION: These reference intervals indicate that clinically and radiographically normal hips may have alpha angles and AORs that have previously been considered  abnormal . The thresholds provided by this study will aid classification of individuals involved in longitudinal studies of FAI and OA, and may be of use to the practicing clinician in evaluating the young adult with hip pain.",M1
20167645,"Kinematics of rising from a chair: image-based analysis of the sagittal <e>hip</e>-spine movement pattern in elderly people who are healthy.BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation of elderly patients with sit-to-stand (STS) dysfunction includes retraining coordinated movement among participating body segments. Although trunk position is considered important, spinal movement has not been measured. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the sagittal thoracolumbar kinematics and hip-lumbar interaction during the STS task in elderly people who were healthy in order to guide physical therapists in developing treatment strategies. DESIGN: This was an observational study. METHODS: Ten retroreflective markers were attached to the midline thoracolumbar spine, pelvis, and right lower limb of 41 elderly people who were healthy. A 2-dimensional video analysis system was used to measure sagittal thoracic, lumbar, hip, and knee joint angles during the STS task. Maximal available flexion-extension angles in these joints and regions also were determined. RESULTS: Prior to buttocks lift-off, forward trunk lean comprised concurrent hip and lumbar flexion and thoracic extension. Hip flexion dominated, with a hip/lumbar ratio of 4.7:1 and a thoracic/lumbar ratio of 1.7:1. The hip and lumbar spine contributed 90% and 23% of their maximal available flexion angle, respectively, and the thoracic spine contributed 86% of its maximal extension range of movement. After lift-off, the hips and lumbar spine extended (ratio of 5.2:1), and the thoracic spine flexed (thoracic/lumbar ratio of 0.4:1). At lift-off, the hips and knees were similarly flexed (96 degrees ) and then locked together in a linear pattern of extension. Following lift-off, there was a brief transition phase (5% of STS duration) in which, although the hips, knees, and lumbar spine were extending, the trunk continued to flex forward a few degrees. LIMITATIONS: Results may differ in elderly people who are less active. CONCLUSIONS: The revised model for image-based analysis demonstrated concurrent hip and thoracolumbar movement during the STS task. Close to full available hip flexion and thoracic extension were needed for optimal STS performance.",M1
20148745,"Diversity of bone cell activity as a histomorphometric feature of idiopathic osteoporosis in men.Although osteoporosis in men is an increasing health problem, studies on osteoporosis in males are still scarce. The aim of our study was to determine the characteristics of bone tissue and bone turnover in men with idiopathic osteoporosis. Transiliac crest bone samples were histomorphometrically analyzed after double tetracycline labeling in 32 men aged 37-65 years who were diagnosed with idiopathic osteoporosis by densitometry of the lumbar spine and <e>hip</e>. Bone volume, osteoid surface, osteoblast surface, eroded surface, osteoid thickness, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, and mineral apposition rate (MAR) were determined in all trabecular bone specimens. Bone volume and structural parameters indicated trabecular bone loss in most patients. Cellular parameters and MAR indicated variations in bone cell actions. No age-related decrease in histomorphometric parameters was found. After the patients were grouped according to MAR values, osteoblast and eroded surfaces were found to be lower in the group with decreased MAR values and elevated in the group of patients with increased MAR parameter. Trabecular thickness was greater in patients with lower than normal MAR, due to reduced resorption and probably loss of very thin trabeculae. Our results suggest that idiopathic osteoporosis in man resembles many characteristics of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women resulting in impaired trabecular structure due to unbalanced cellular activity and bone turnover rate.",M1
20147582,"Plasma adipokines, bone mass, and <e>hip</e> geometry in rural Chinese adolescents.CONTEXT: Adipokines have been linked to bone phenotypes recently, but with conflicting results. Few such studies have been conducted in adolescents. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the associations of adiponectin and leptin with multiple bone phenotypes in Chinese adolescents and estimate the genetic contribution to these associations. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in rural China. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 675 males and 575 females aged 13-21 yr were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: Fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), bone area (BA), bone mineral content (BMC), cross-sectional area (CSA), and section modulus (SM) were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Plasma adipokine concentration was determined using sandwich immunoassays. RESULTS: Adiponectin was inversely associated with all BMCs in males (P &lt; 0.01), but not in females, after adjusting for LM, body weight, or BMI singly, or for LM and FM simultaneously. No such relationships were observed for CSA or SM in both genders. Leptin was inversely associated with all BAs, total-hip BMC, CSA, and SM in both genders, when adjusting for body weight or BMI. These associations, except for whole-body BA and lumbar spine BA in females, disappeared when simultaneously adjusting for LM and FM. By Cholesky decomposition models using twin design, significant genetic correlations were detected between adiponectin and total-hip BMC in males and between leptin and total-hip BMC in both genders. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that adiponectin and leptin were inversely associated with adolescent bone phenotypes but showed differential associations by gender, type of bone phenotypes, and adjustment of FM. This study also suggested that adipokines and bone phenotypes may share a common set of genes.",M1
20146897,"Evaluation of the effect of 4 months of risedronate therapy on femoral strength using femoral strength analysis tools.The effect of risedronate (2.5 mg once daily) on femoral strength was evaluated using Advanced <e>Hip</e> Assessment (AHA) for the first time in Japan. In total, 104 patients with primary osteoporosis and available data on bone mineral density (BMD; lumbar spine/proximal femur), urinary NTx (cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen) and AHA-based parameters collected before and after 4 months of risedronate therapy were included in the analyses. Change and percentage change from baseline in these parameters were determined. Percentage change in femur strength index was 7.9 +/- 21.1% and 5.5 +/- 18.0% for the right and left femurs, respectively; both increases were statistically significant. Cross-sectional moment of inertia, cross-sectional area and mean neck width in the femoral neck region of interest also increased significantly in both femurs. Percentage change in lumbar spine BMD (L2 - L4) was 3.0 +/- 3.7%, and proximal femoral BMD was 1.1 +/- 3.1% and 0.7 +/- 3.2% in the right and left femurs, respectively, all showing a significant increase from baseline. Percentage change in urinary NTx was -41.5 +/- 30.5%, which was a significant decrease. Using AHA, this study showed that, in patients with primary osteoporosis, risedronate improved BMD and bone quality, thereby enhancing femoral strength as early as 4 months after treatment initiation.",M1
20132136,"Effectiveness of functional progressive resistance exercise strength training on muscle strength and mobility in children with cerebral palsy: a randomized controlled trial.AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of functional progressive resistance exercise (PRE) strength training on muscle strength and mobility in children with cerebral palsy (CP). METHOD: Fifty-one children with spastic uni- and bilateral CP; (29 males, 22 females; mean age 10 y 5 mo, SD 1 y 10 mo, range 6 y 0 mo-13 y 10 mo; Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I-III) were randomized to the intervention group (n=26) or the control group (n=25, receiving usual care). The intervention group trained for 12 weeks, three times a week, on a five-exercise circuit, which included a leg-press and functional exercises. The training load progressively increased based on the child's maximum level of strength, determined by the eight-repetition maximum. Muscle strength (measured with hand-held dynamometry and a six-repetition maximum leg-press test), mobility (measured with the Gross Motor Function Measure, two functional tests, and a mobility questionnaire), and spasticity (measured by the appearance of a catch) were evaluated before, during, directly after, and 6 weeks after the end of training by two blinded research assistants. RESULTS: Directly after training, there was a statistically significant effect (p&lt;0.05) on muscle strength (knee extensors +12% [0.56 N/kg; 95% confidence interval {CI} 0.13-0.99]; <e>hip</e> abductors +11% [0.27 N/kg; 95% CI 0.00-0.54]; total +8% [1.30 N/kg; 95% CI 0.56-2.54]; six-repetition maximum +14% [14%; 95% CI 1.99-26.35]), but not on mobility or spasticity. A detraining effect was seen after 6 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Twelve weeks of functional PRE strength training increases muscle strength up to 14%. This strength gain did not lead to improved mobility.",M1
20120679,"Infantile <e>hip</e> arthroscopy: the relationship between neurovascular anatomy and the portal pathway.OBJECTIVE: In the past, studies of hip arthroscopy portal path relate with extra-articular structures were done in adults. This study was investigated in the infantile group. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 10 hips of fresh infantile cadavers. K-wire diameter 2.4 mm. are representing scope pathway. Three portals (anterior, anterolateral and posterolateral) in supine position without traction were chose to used in this study. RESULTS: One cadaver was female and four were male. The mean age and weight when death occurred was 74 days and the mean weight was 3584.4 gm. At the anterior portal, the most lateral branch of LFCN was frequently injured. The average distant of femoral nerve to the K-wire was 11.2 (7-14) mm. Transverse branch of lateral femoral circumflex artery had an average distant 8.5(6-14) mm and the terminal branch could be identified in four hip and average distance was 1 mm. At the anterolateral portal two, greater trochanter were injured by K-wire. In the posterolateral portal the average distant from K-wire to sciatic nerve was 13.2 mm. CONCLUSION: From this pilot study, the distance of major neurovascular structure as related to hip scope path is nearly a centimeter on average.",M1

INTERVENTIONS: Surface electromyographic signals of iliocostalis, multifidus, gluteus maximus, rectus abdominis, and external and internal oblique muscles were recorded in 4 knee stretch exercises: retroverted pelvis with flexed trunk; anteverted pelvis with extended trunk; neutral pelvis with inclined trunk; and neutral pelvis with trunk parallel to the ground. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Root mean square values of each muscle and exercise in both phases of hip extension and flexion, normalized by the maximal voluntary isometric contraction. RESULTS: The retroverted pelvis with flexed trunk position led to significantly increased external oblique and gluteus maximus muscle activation. The anteverted pelvis with trunk extension significantly increased multifidus muscle activity. The neutral pelvis position led to significantly lower activity of all muscles. Rectus abdominis muscle activation to maintain body posture was similar in all exercises and was not influenced by position of the pelvis and trunk. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in the pelvic and trunk positions in the knee stretch exercises change the activation pattern of the multifidus, gluteus maximus, rectus abdominis, and oblique muscles. The lower level of activation of the rectus abdominis muscle suggests that pelvic stability is maintained in the 4 exercise positions.",M1
20101398,"Common genetic variation in the DKK1 gene is associated with <e>hip</e> axis length but not with bone mineral density and bone turnover markers in young adult men: results from the Odense Androgen Study.LRP5 was recently confirmed as an important susceptibility gene for osteoporosis. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of DKK1 polymorphisms on bone mineral density (BMD), hip geometry, and bone turnover. DKK1 is a secreted protein that binds to LRP5/6 receptors and inhibits canonical Wnt signaling. Using HapMap, we selected three SNPs covering the genetic variation in a 13.53-kb region comprising DKK1. The Odense Androgen Study is a population-based study comprising 783 Caucasian men aged 20-29 years. BMD and hip structural parameters were available for study. Bone turnover markers were used as a secondary end point. All analyses were repeated after adjusting for covariables and in subgroups according to physical activity. We found no significant association between DKK1 and BMD or markers of bone turnover; however, a significant association (P = 0.012) was found for rs1569198 with hip axis length (HAL), independent of BMD and height. Moreover, the association seemed to be driven by the non-sedentary subgroup (P = 0.004). Haplotype analysis further confirmed the association of rs1569198 with HAL. Furthermore, we obtained indications for interaction between DKK1 and LRP5 genotypes for different hip geometry parameters. As almost all variance within the DKK1 gene was covered, we conclude that common variation in this gene does not markedly influence BMD or bone turnover markers in young men. In this population, however, a common SNP in DKK1 does have a significant effect on HAL, implying a possible effect on hip fracture risk in the general population. This finding could be of interest but needs replication in independent populations.",M1
20089823,"Abnormal volitional <e>hip</e> torque phasing and hip impairments in gait post stroke.The purpose of this study was to quantify how volitional control of hip torque relates to walking function poststroke. Volitional phasing of hip flexion and extension torques was assessed using a load-cell-instrumented servomotor drive system in 11 chronic stroke subjects and 5 age-matched controls. Hips were oscillated from approximately 40 degrees of hip flexion to 10 degrees of hip extension at a frequency of 0.50 Hz during three movement conditions [hips in phase (IP), 180 degrees out of phase (OP), and unilateral hip movement (UN)] while the knees and ankles were held stationary. The magnitude and phasing of hip, knee, and ankle torques were measured during each movement condition. Surface electromyography was measured throughout the legs. Over ground gait analysis was done for all stroke subjects. During robotic-assisted movement conditions, the paretic limb produced peak hip torques when agonist hip musculature was stretched instead of midway through the movement as seen in the nonparetic and control limbs (P &lt; 0.012). However, mean torque magnitudes of the paretic and nonparetic limbs were not significantly different. Abnormalities of paretic hip torque phasing were more pronounced during bilateral movement conditions and were associated with quadriceps overactivity. The magnitude of flexion torque produced during maximal hip extension was correlated with the Fugl Meyer Score, self-selected walking speed, and maximal hip extension during over ground walking. These results suggest that hyperexcitable stretch reflexes in the paretic limb impair coordinated hip torque phasing and likely interfere with walking function post stroke.",M1
20089809,"Effects of ankle and <e>hip</e> muscle afferent inputs on rhythm generation during fictive locomotion.Hip position and loading of limb extensors are major sensory cues for the initiation and duration of different phases during walking. Although these inputs have pathways projecting to the locomotor rhythm generator, their effects may vary in different parts of the locomotor cycle. In the present study, the plantaris (Pl), sartorius (Sart), rectus femoris (RF), and caudal gluteal (cGlu) nerves were stimulated at group I and/or group II strength during spontaneous fictive locomotion in 16 adult decerebrate cats. These nerves supply muscles that extend the ankle (Pl), flex the hip (Sart, RF), or extend the hip (cGlu). Stimuli were given at six epochs of the locomotor cycle to evaluate when they access the rhythm generator. Group I afferents from Pl nerve always reset the locomotor rhythm; stimulation during extension prolonged cycle period and extension phase duration, while stimulation during flexion terminated flexion and initiated extension. On the other hand, stimulating RF and cGlu nerves only produced significant effects on the rhythm in precise epochs, particularly during mid-flexion and/or mid- to late extension. Stimulating the Sart nerve produced complex effects on the rhythm that were not distributed evenly to all extensor motor pools. The most consistent effect was reduced flexion phase duration with stimulation during flexion, particularly at group II strength, and prolongation of the extension phase but only in late extension. That hip muscle afferents reset the rhythm in only specific epochs of the locomotor cycle suggests that the rhythm generator operates with several subdivisions to determine phase and cycle durations.",M1
20089075,"Bone mineral density in diabetes mellitus patients with and without a Charcot foot.OBJECTIVE: To measure bone mineral density in patients with diabetes mellitus and the complication Charcot osteoarthropathy (CA). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 49 patients with diabetes were investigated. The population consisted of patients with an acute CA (n = 17) or chronic CA (n = 7). Control groups consisted of diabetes patients with (n = 9) and without neuropathy (n = 11) and who had an amputation of the first toe (n = 5). Values measured were bone mineral density (BMD) in lumbar spine, <e>hip</e> and calcaneus, using lunar DEXA scanner. The bone turnover markers CTX-1 and N-MID were measured. RESULTS: There were no differences in BMD measured in the spine and hip. There was an increase in the markers of bone turnover in the patients with acute CA. The BMD of the calcaneus was statistically lower in the affected foot in patients with chronic Charcot (P &lt; 0.01), than in the unaffected foot, but there were no statistically significant differences between the BMD of the calcaneus in the feet in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: From this study, we can conclude that there were no differences in BMD values in the spine and hip between groups. There were no differences between BMD of the calcaneus between groups, except that patients with chronic Charcot had a significantly lower calcaneal BMD in the affected foot than in the healthy foot. Furthermore, there was an increased bone turnover in the group with acute CA, which was not found in the other patients groups. This suggests that the Charcot foot is a rather local phenomenon, with little effect on the skeleton in general.",M1
20048117,"Assessment of <e>hip</e> and knee muscle function in orthopaedic practice and research.Isometric evaluation of hip and knee muscle strength can be a useful objective assessment tool in the clinic and may be preferred over other forms of dynamic muscle testing, such as isokinetic assessment or variable-resistance weight-lifting. Assessment of isometric strength with use of a handheld dynamometer requires little skill and is easily administered, relatively inexpensive, valid, reliable, and functional; thus, it could be easily integrated into routine clinical examinations. Surface electrical stimulation, electromyography, and ultrasonography can be used in conjunction with isometric muscle testing for the identification of neuromuscular factors influencing muscle force generation. Further research is warranted to investigate the neural and/or muscular impairments associated with hip and knee muscle weakness in orthopaedic populations, with the ultimate goal of improving rehabilitation strategies.",M1
20041381,"Results of total <e>hip</e> arthroplasties in the young patient; further evidence for a barrier against articular wear debris by hydroxyapatite coatings.We examined the hypothesis that the circumferential osseous apposition around HA-coated implants forms a protective barrier against articular wear debris. Sixty-five hydroxyapatite-coated total hip arthroplasties in 57 patients (age &lt;50years) with polyethylene-metal articulation were evaluated regarding PE-wear, osteolysis, and clinical outcome at a minimum of 10 years follow-up. There was no correlation between PE-wear and osteolysis of the femoral zones or cup zones I and III. A strong Pearson correlation was found between polyethylene wear and osteolysis around cup zone II, where the cup only consisted of polyethylene (p&lt;0,01). The aseptic failure rate was 1.5% for the femoral component and 4.5% for the cup after 10 years of follow-up. The average Harris Hip Score was 90 and the average Engh score for fixation was 23 after 10 years . Around HA-coated parts of the prosthesis bone formation remained stable, regardless of the degree of polyethylene wear. The average linear polyethylene wear was 0,16 mm/year. The circumferential osseous apposition of the HA-coated implants possibly formed a protective barrier against articular wear debris. The use of cups with a backside gap resulted in PE-wear associated osteolysis in cup zone II and may be considered to be best avoided.",M1
20032741,"The evaluation of <e>hip</e> muscles in patients treated with one-stage combined procedure for unilateral developmental dysplasia of the hip: part II: isokinetic muscle strength evaluation.BACKGROUND: To assess the isokinetic muscle strength (IMS) of hip flexor and extensor muscles in patients treated with one-stage combined procedure for developmental dysplasia of the hip and analyze the effect of the status of hip muscles on IMS. METHODS: Twenty-two patients were included in the study. The mean age was 154.4+/-34.6 (110-216) months and the mean follow-up was 112.6+/-32.0 (68-159) months. All patients underwent complete tenotomy of the iliopsoas muscle to ease open reduction and had excellent results according to the modified McKay criteria of Barrett and type I hips according to the radiologic criteria of Severin. All patients had earlier magnetic resonance imaging examination that revealed reattachment of the iliopsoas in 7 (32%) patients. IMS measurements were performed at 120 degrees/s and 240 degrees/s. The peak torque (PT), PT angle, total work (TW), and average power (AP) values of operated and nonoperated hips were recorded separately for flexors and extensors. RESULTS: For flexors, TW and AP values were lower at the operated hip when compared with the nonoperated hip at both angular velocities. PT was only lower at the operated hip at 120 degrees/s. For extensor muscles, PT, TW, AP, and PT angle showed no statistically significant difference at either angular velocity. For flexors, the PT deficit between the operated and nonoperated hips at 120 degrees/s and 240 degrees/s was measured as 15.3% and 8.0%, respectively. There was no difference between the flexor muscles of operated and nonoperated hips considering PT, TW, and AP at both angular velocities in patients with reattachment. The IMS deficit of flexor muscles at 120 degrees/s was significantly higher in patients without reattachment of iliopsoas when compared with those with reattachment, and correlated to the widths of the iliopsoas muscle at levels II and III. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the results of surgical treatment of DDH with conventional radiologic and functional criteria might be misleading in some patients with excellent results because some of these patients, particularly those without reattachment of the iliopsoas muscle, experience significant weakness in hip flexion.",M1
20030815,"PLCL1 rs7595412 variation is not associated with <e>hip</e> bone size variation in postmenopausal Danish women.BACKGROUND: Bone size (BS) variation is under strong genetic control and plays an important role in determining bone strength and fracture risk. Recently, a genome-wide association study identified polymorphisms associated with hip BS variation in the PLCL1 (phospholipase c-like 1) locus. Carriers of the major A allele of the most significant polymorphism, rs7595412, have around 17% larger hip BS than non-carriers. We therefore hypothesized that this polymorphism may also influence postmenopausal complications. METHODS: The effects of rs7595412 on hip BS, bone mineral density (BMD), vertebral fractures, serum Crosslaps and osteocalcin levels were analyzed in 1,191 postmenopausal Danish women. RESULTS: This polymorphism had no influence on hip and spine BS as well as on femur and spine BMD. Women carrying at least one copy of the A allele had lower levels of serum osteocalcin as compared with those homozygous for the G allele (p = 0.03) whereas no effect on serum Crosslaps was detected. Furthermore, women homozygous for the A allele were more affected by vertebral fractures than those carrying at least one copy of the G allele (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women, our results suggest that the PLCL1 rs7595412 polymorphism has no obvious effect on hip BS or BMD but may be nominally associated with increased proportion of vertebral fracture and increased levels of osteocalcin.",M1
20026553,"Acute non-traumatic <e>hip</e> pathology in children: incidence and presentation in family practice.BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis of children with acute non-traumatic hip pathology varies from quite harmless conditions such as transient synovitis of the hip to more severe problems like Perthes' disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) and life-threatening conditions such as septic arthritis of the hip. OBJECTIVE: To provide population-based data on symptom presentation and incidence rates of non-traumatic acute hip pathology in family practice. METHODS: We analysed data from a large national survey of family practice (104 practices), which was carried out by the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL) in 2001. We included all children aged 0-14 years. Incidence rates were calculated by dividing the total number of cases (numerator) by the average study population at risk (denominator). RESULTS: Our study population consisted of 73 954 children aged 0-14 years, yielding 68 202 person-years. These children presented with 101 episodes of acute non-traumatic hip pathology. The presenting feature in 81.5% of the children was pain, in 8.6% limping and 9.9% presented with both symptoms. Only 27% of the participating family practitioners (FPs) reported whether the child had a fever. The incidence rate for all acute non-traumatic hip pathology was 148.1 per 100 000 person-years, and for transient synovitis, this was 76.2 per 100 000 person-years. CONCLUSION: In family practice, most children with acute non-traumatic hip pathology present with pain as the initial symptom. FPs need to be more aware that fever is the main distinguishing factor between a harmless condition and a life-threatening condition. Transient synovitis is the diagnosis with the highest incidence rate.",M1
20020335,"Immunologic adverse reaction associated with low-carbide metal-on-metal bearings in total <e>hip</e> arthroplasty.BACKGROUND: An increased incidence of periprosthetic osteolysis, resulting in loss of biologic fixation, has been reported in contemporary THAs with low-carbide metal-on-metal compared with metal-on-polyethylene couple bearings. Although a hypersensitivity reaction attributable to Co and Cr debris is reportedly a potential cause for failure of THAs with high-carbide bearings, there are no evidence-based data for this reaction in low-carbide metal-on-metal bearings, although such hypersensitivity might be related to osteolysis. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We investigated whether there were differences in immunologic hypersensitivity reactions in retrievals from revised THAs with ceramic-on-polyethylene versus metal-on-metal bearing couples. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared newly formed capsule and periprosthetic interface membranes from revision surgery for aseptic failure from 20 patients with low-carbide bearings and 13 patients with ceramic-on-polyethylene bearings. For control tissue, we obtained samples from the hip capsule during the primary THA implantation in 13 patients with low-carbide bearings and seven with ceramic-on-polyethylene bearings. We examined the tissues with conventional histologic and immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: Compared with tissue from the control subjects and patients with ceramic-on-polyethylene bearings, the tissues from patients with low-carbide metal-on-metal bearings were associated with (1) extensive necrosis and fibrin exudation in the newly formed hip capsule and (2) diffuse and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration of a higher degree than in the hips with ceramic-on-polyethylene bearings in conventional histologic examination, and (3) more T than B cells. CONCLUSIONS: The conventional histologic and immunohistochemical findings in tissues retrieved from failed THAs with low-carbide metal-on-metal bearings are consistent with a link between hypersensitivity and osteolysis with low-carbide bearing couples.",M1
20014253,"Low-level laser therapy as a non-invasive approach for body contouring: a randomized, controlled study.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Transmission electron microscopic images have demonstrated the formation of transitory pores in adipocyte cell membranes followed by the collapse of adipose cells subsequent to laser irradiation of 635 nm. The objective is to evaluate the application of a 635 nm and 17.5 mW exit power per multiple diode laser for the application of non-invasive body contouring of the waist, <e>hips</e>, and thighs. STUDY DESIGN/PATIENTS AND METHODS: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a 2-week non-invasive laser treatment conducted from May 2007 to June 2008 across multiple-private practice sites in the United States of America. Sixty-seven volunteers between the ages of 18-65 with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 30 kg/m(2) and who satisfied the set inclusion criteria participated. Eight of the 67 subjects did not have circumference measurements recorded at the 2-week post-procedure measurement point. Participants were randomly assigned to receive low-level laser treatments or a matching sham treatment three times per week for 2 weeks. Reduction in the total combined inches of circumference measurements of the waist, hip and bilateral thighs from baseline to the completion of the 2-week procedure administration phase was assessed. RESULTS: Participants in the treatment group demonstrated an overall reduction in total circumference across all three sites of -3.51 in. (P &lt; 0.001) compared with control subjects who revealed a -0.684 reduction (P &lt; 0.071745). Test group participants demonstrated a reduction of -0.98 in. (P &lt; 0.0001) across the waist, -1.05 in. (P &lt; 0.01) across the hip, and -0.85 in. (P &lt; 0.01) and -0.65 in. (P &lt; 0.01) across the right and left thighs from baseline to 2 weeks (end of treatment). At 2 weeks post-procedure, test group subjects demonstrated a gain of 0.31 total inches collectively across all three sites. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that low-level laser therapy can reduce overall circumference measurements of specifically treated regions.",M1
20012223,"The consumption of food products from linseed-fed animals maintains erythrocyte omega-3 fatty acids in obese humans.Based on mechanistic and epidemiological data, we raise the question of the relationship between qualitative dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) changes and increase in obesity. In this double-blind trial, we studied the effects on 160 overweight volunteers (body mass index, BMI &gt;30) of a 90 days experimental diet rich principally in animal fat with a low PUFA/saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratio but a low n-6/n-3 ratio, using animal products obtained from linseed-fed animals. The control diet provided less animal fat, a higher PUFA/SFA ratio and a higher n-6/n-3 ratio. Both diets excluded seafood. In the experimental group, we observed a significant increase in red blood cell (RBC) alpha-linolenic acid content and a slight increase in EPA and DHA derivatives, while in the control group we observed a significant reduction in EPA and DHA content. Between groups now, the difference in the three n-3 fatty acids changes in RBC was significant. This demonstrates that plasma EPA and DHA levels can be maintained without fish if products from linseed-fed animals are used. During the diets, we noted a significant reduction in weight, BMI and <e>hip</e> circumference within both groups of volunteers. However, no significant difference was observed between the control group and the experimental group. Interestingly, 150 days after the end of the trial (i.e., day 240), we noted a significant weight gain in the control group, whereas no significant weight gain was observed in the experimental group. This was also observed for the BMI and hip circumference. Moreover, significant differences in BMI (P &lt; 0.05) and weight (P = 0.05) appeared between the two groups, showing in both cases a smaller increase in the experimental group. During the 90 days trial, we did not observe any differences between groups in terms of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or triglycerides, suggesting that the saturate content and the P/S ratio are not as important as the n-6 and n-3 fatty acid composition.",M1
20009184,"A fast and pragmatic approach for scatter correction in flat-detector CT using elliptic modeling and iterative optimization.Scattered radiation is a major source of artifacts in flat detector computed tomography (FDCT) due to the increased irradiated volumes. We propose a fast projection-based algorithm for correction of scatter artifacts. The presented algorithm combines a convolution method to determine the spatial distribution of the scatter intensity distribution with an object-size-dependent scaling of the scatter intensity distributions using a priori information generated by Monte Carlo simulations. A projection-based (PBSE) and an image-based (IBSE) strategy for size estimation of the scanned object are presented. Both strategies provide good correction and comparable results; the faster PBSE strategy is recommended. Even with such a fast and simple algorithm that in the PBSE variant does not rely on reconstructed volumes or scatter measurements, it is possible to provide a reasonable scatter correction even for truncated scans. For both simulations and measurements, scatter artifacts were significantly reduced and the algorithm showed stable behavior in the z-direction. For simulated voxelized head, <e>hip</e> and thorax phantoms, a figure of merit Q of 0.82, 0.76 and 0.77 was reached, respectively (Q = 0 for uncorrected, Q = 1 for ideal). For a water phantom with 15 cm diameter, for example, a cupping reduction from 10.8% down to 2.1% was achieved. The performance of the correction method has limitations in the case of measurements using non-ideal detectors, intensity calibration, etc. An iterative approach to overcome most of these limitations was proposed. This approach is based on root finding of a cupping metric and may be useful for other scatter correction methods as well. By this optimization, cupping of the measured water phantom was further reduced down to 0.9%. The algorithm was evaluated on a commercial system including truncated and non-homogeneous clinically relevant objects.",M1
20004271,"Oral contraceptive use and bone density in adolescent and young adult women.BACKGROUND: Most of the millions of oral contraceptive (OC) users are under 30 years of age and in the critical period for bone mass accrual. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study of 606 women aged 14-30 years examined both OC duration and estrogen dose and their association with bone mineral density (BMD) at the <e>hip</e>, spine, and whole body (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry). RESULTS: Of 389 OC users and 217 nonusers enrolled, 50% were adolescents (14-18 years). Of OC users, 38% used  low-dose  OCs [&lt;30 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE)]. In adolescents, mean BMD differed by neither OC duration nor EE dose. However, 19- to 30-year-old women's mean BMD was lower with longer OC use for spine and whole body (p=.004 and p=.02, respectively) and lowest for &gt;12 months of low-dose OCs for the hip, spine and whole body (p=.02, .003 and .002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged use of today's OCs, particularly &lt;30 mcg EE, may adversely impact young adult women's bone density while using these agents.",M1
19959830,"The effects of treadmill exercise training on <e>hip</e> bone density and tibial bone geometry in stroke survivors: a pilot study.BACKGROUND: Individuals with stroke often sustain bone loss on the hemiparetic side and are prone to fragility fractures. Exercise training may be a viable way to promote bone mineral density (BMD) and geometry in this population. OBJECTIVE: This was a pilot study to evaluate the effects of a 6-month treadmill exercise program on hip BMD and tibial bone geometry in chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: Twenty-one individuals with chronic stroke, with a mean age of 64.5 years and mean post-stroke duration of 8.3 years participated in the study. The treatment group underwent a treadmill gait exercise program (two 1-hour sessions per week for 6 months), whereas the control group participated in their usual self-selected activities in the community. The primary outcomes were hip BMD and bone geometry of the midshaft tibia on the paretic side, whereas the secondary outcomes were gait velocity, endurance, leg muscle strength, balance self-efficacy, and physical activity level. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the change in all outcome variables between the 2 groups after treatment. RESULTS: Significant between-group differences in change scores of tibial cortical thickness (P = .016), endurance ( P = .029), leg muscle strength on the paretic side (P &lt; .001) and non-paretic side (P &lt; .001), balance self-efficacy (P = .016), and physical activity level (P = .023) were found. CONCLUSION: The treadmill exercise program induced a modest improvement in tibial bone geometry in individuals with chronic stroke. Further studies are required to explore the optimal training protocol for promoting favorable changes in bone parameters following stroke.",M1
19959770,"Distributed lag and spline modeling for predicting energy expenditure from accelerometry in youth.Movement sensing using accelerometers is commonly used for the measurement of physical activity (PA) and estimating energy expenditure (EE) under free-living conditions. The major limitation of this approach is lack of accuracy and precision in estimating EE, especially in low-intensity activities. Thus the objective of this study was to investigate benefits of a distributed lag spline (DLS) modeling approach for the prediction of total daily EE (TEE) and EE in sedentary (1.0-1.5 metabolic equivalents; MET), light (1.5-3.0 MET), and moderate/vigorous (&gt; or = 3.0 MET) intensity activities in 10- to 17-year-old youth (n = 76). We also explored feasibility of the DLS modeling approach to predict physical activity EE (PAEE) and METs. Movement was measured by Actigraph accelerometers placed on the <e>hip</e>, wrist, and ankle. With whole-room indirect calorimeter as the reference standard, prediction models (Hip, Wrist, Ankle, Hip+Wrist, Hip+Wrist+Ankle) for TEE, PAEE, and MET were developed and validated using the fivefold cross-validation method. The TEE predictions by these DLS models were not significantly different from the room calorimeter measurements (all P &gt; 0.05). The Hip+Wrist+Ankle predicted TEE better than other models and reduced prediction errors in moderate/vigorous PA for TEE, MET, and PAEE (all P &lt; 0.001). The Hip+Wrist reduced prediction errors for the PAEE and MET at sedentary PA (P = 0.020 and 0.021) compared with the Hip. Models that included Wrist correctly classified time spent at light PA better than other models. The means and standard deviations of the prediction errors for the Hip+Wrist+Ankle and Hip were 0.4 +/- 144.0 and 1.5 +/- 164.7 kcal for the TEE, 0.0 +/- 84.2 and 1.3 +/- 104.7 kcal for the PAEE, and -1.1 +/- 97.6 and -0.1 +/- 108.6 MET min for the MET models. We conclude that the DLS approach for accelerometer data improves detailed EE prediction in youth.",M1

The highly skilled clinician is trained to look at the  linkage  between the trunk and all parts of the lower extremity. Why is the hip not transferring the load well? Where is the breakdown? The gluteus medius, pelvic stability, and supportive muscular slings are of great importance when optimizing the function of the hip. The hip is subjected to forces equal to multiples of the body weight and requires osseous, articular and myofascial integrity for stability.

19945335,"The Spineangel: Examining the validity and reliability of a novel clinical device for monitoring trunk motion.Spinal loading in excessive and repeated trunk flexion may hinder recovery from acute low back pain. The Spineangel device provides real-time patient biofeedback on trunk flexion and may facilitate recovery from lower back injury. This cross-sectional study evaluates validity and reliability of this device in the laboratory setting. Participants included 18 healthy males. Angular displacements were simultaneously obtained from a Spineangel device placed on the <e>hip</e> and criterion measures of hip, lumbar and total sagittal rotation, and pelvic tilt obtained via 3D Motion Analysis. Each participant repeated four movements five times in a random order (forward bending fingertips-to-knees and to mid-lower leg, full flexion, and full extension). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for Spineangel measurement of trunk motion were excellent (ICC&gt;0.9). The coefficient of repeatability was less than 5.2 degrees in both flexion and extension. Spineangel showed the highest correlation with Motion Analysis((R)) measurement of pelvic tilt with no statistical difference between measures when bending forward to fingertips-to-knees. Given its high reliability, the Spineangel device has potential as a trunk flexion biofeedback device. Further investigation is required to see if these laboratory results can be reproduced in the clinical setting and to determine the clinical benefits of such a device.",M1
19934702,"The evaluation of <e>hip</e> muscles in patients treated with one-stage combined procedure for unilateral developmental dysplasia of the hip: part I: MRI evaluation.BACKGROUND: To assess the status of hip flexor and extensor muscles with MRI in patients with unilateral developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) after walking age who were treated with one-stage combined procedure. METHODS: Twenty-two patients operated upon with one-stage combined procedure for unilateral DDH were included in this study. All patients underwent complete tenotomy of the iliopsoas muscle hindering open reduction. All patients showed excellent results according to the modified McKay criteria of Barrett and type 1 hips according to radiologic criteria of Severin at the latest follow-up. MRI assessment of iliopsoas, rectus femoris, tensor fasia lata, sartorius, and gluteus maximus muscles was performed and muscles of the hip that was operated upon were compared with the hip that was not. In addition, the iliopsoas muscle was examined for reattachment and the effect of reattachment was evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age was 154.4+/-34.6 (110 to 216) months. Mean follow-up was 112.6+/-32.0 (68 to 159) months. Reattachment of the iliopsoas was observed in 7 (32%) patients, with no significance in terms of age, postoperative follow-up period, or the duration of the postoperative period. Atrophy in the hip that was operated upon was significant in iliopsoas, rectus femoris, tensor fasia lata, and gluteus maximus muscles when compared with the hip that was not. No significance was detected in the sartorius muscle between hips that were operated upon and those that were not. Cross-sectional areas of tensor fascia lata, rectus femoris, sartorius, and gluteus maximus muscles were not significantly different between patients with and without reattachment of iliopsoas. The width of the iliopsoas muscle was significantly lowered in patients without reattachment. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DDH treated with combined procedures including complete iliopsoas tenotomy do not have hip muscles similar to hip muscles that have not been operated upon, despite excellent radiologic and clinical results.

19932980,"Some physical and clinical factors influencing the measurement of precision error, least significant change, and bone mineral density in dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the standard method of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) at highly trabecular bone, which can be statistically linked to the risk of fracture. For DXA, precision error (PE) and phantom-based accuracy studies are among the most important routine quality control procedures. A precision study was performed at our institution using International Society for Clinical Densitometry guidelines. Comparing our results with those reported by other investigators, we draw the following general conclusions: the PE was higher for the spine than the <e>hip</e>, which we attribute to the better geometric reproducibility at the hip. The hypothesis that the DXA calculates BMD relative to water was validated. Whether follow-up measurements are performed by the same technologist on the same day-or different technologists on subsequent days-does not appear to have a clinically significant impact on PE or least significant change (LSC). Mixing beam types (i.e., fan and pencil) may affect lumbar PE and LSC measurements more significantly than those of the hip. The use of a single technologist may reduce the PE for the lumbar spine but appears to increase it for the hip. Restricting the patient population to the female gender has the apparent effect of narrowing the gap between lumbar and hip PEs. Finally, the degree of BMD measurement accuracy can be affected by the type of phantom being used (e.g., European Spine Phantom vs Lunar phantom) and the faults in specific DXA edge detection algorithms.",M1
19924356,"Estimation of stature by measuring fibula and ulna bone length in 2443 older adults.Estimation of Stature by Measuring Fibula and Ulna Bone Length in 2443 Older Adults. OBJECTIVES: Knee height has been commonly used to estimate stature but may not always be possible in the frail older adults with compromised posture. Measurement of fibula and ulna bone length could be an alternative method. We attempted to develop and validate regression models to predict measured and reported height using age, fibula length, ulna length, <e>hip</e> circumferences and body weight. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey. SETTING: The study was conducted in the Jockey Club Centre for Osteoporosis Care and Control, School of Public Health, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand four hundred and forty three community-dwelling older Chinese aged from 65 to 98 years were recruited. MEASUREMENTS: The standing height, fibula length, ulna length, hip circumference and body weight were measured and the reported height was recorded. Three separate multiple linear regression models were developed to predict measured-height and reported-height respectively. RESULTS: In predicting measured-height by the bone-length model, the mean errors were +0.52 cm (over-estimation) in men and +0.45 cm (over-estimation) in women and the SDs were +/- 3.5 cm in both genders. The 95% limits of agreement were: -6.65 to +7.70 cm for men and -6.59 to +7.49 cm for women. CONCLUSION: The accuracy and precision of stature estimation by fibula and ulna bone length is comparable to that by knee height. This may be an acceptable alternative method when knee height measurement is difficult or when the knee height caliper is not available.",M1

Their combination makes the pelvis the most defining skeletal element to read human evolution. Recent revival in joint preserving hip surgery have brought to attention morphological variations of the human hip that appear similar to hips of extant mammals. In man, such variations can produce hip osteoarthrosis through motion. We reviewed the evolution of the hip and pelvis with special interest in morphology that can lead to motion induced osteoarthrosis in man. The combination of giving birth to big brained babies and walking upright has produced marked differences between the sexes in pelvis and hip morphology, each having their characteristic mode of hip impingement and osteoarthrosis.",M1

Their last available CD4(+) T-cell counts were 243 cells/mm(3), 245 cells/mm(3) and 8 cells/mm(3), respectively. They had all received antiretroviral therapy for &gt;4 years, including lopinavir/ritonavir for &gt;8 months. The other risk factors were hypertriglyceridaemia (n=3), smoking addiction (n=2), alcohol consumption (n=2) and lipodystrophy (n=1). All three patients had heterozygous haemoglobin AS sickle cell disease (percentage of haemoglobin S 41%, 45% and 50%, respectively). The diagnosis of avascular osteonecrosis of the femoral head (unilateral n=2 and bilateral n=1) was documented by CT scan. Only one patient underwent surgical arthroplasty. In resource-limited settings, avascular osteonecrosis is uneasy to diagnose and unlikely to be appropriately treated. Physicians should be aware of its symptoms and risk factors, including HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy. Future studies should explore whether these risk factors might include haemoglobin AS sickle cell disease, a common trait in the West African general population.",M1
19918047,"Baseline glucocorticoid dose and bone mineral density response with teriparatide or alendronate therapy in patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.OBJECTIVE: This post-hoc analysis studied the effect of baseline glucocorticoid dose on the 18-month bone mineral density (BMD) response to teriparatide 20 microg/day or alendronate 10 mg/day in 387 patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) from a randomized, double-blind trial. METHODS: Lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total <e>hip</e> (TH) BMD were measured at baseline and 18 months. Mean baseline glucocorticoid dose was categorized as low (&lt; or = 5 mg/day), medium (&gt; 5 and &lt; 15 mg/day), or high (&gt; or = 15 mg/day). RESULTS: Baseline LS, FN, and TH BMD were similar between groups, and between glucocorticoid dose categories within each group. LS BMD increases at the low, medium, and high glucocorticoid doses were 8.1%, 6.6%, and 4.6%, respectively, with teriparatide, and 3.6%, 2.8%, and 2.3% with alendronate. Analyzed as a continuous variable, higher glucocorticoid doses had a negative, but non-significant, effect on the percentage increase in LS BMD in both groups. Glucocorticoid dose did not significantly affect FN or TH BMD increases in either group. Across the 3 glucocorticoid dose categories, the overall LS BMD increases were different for both treatments combined (p = 0.033), but the relative differences between the treatment groups were not different (interaction, p = 0.52). CONCLUSION: Teriparatide and alendronate increased LS and hip BMD across a range of baseline glucocorticoid doses. LS BMD increases with teriparatide were greater in the low-dose category than in the high-dose category. Overall LS BMD increases were significantly greater with teriparatide compared with alendronate, which may reflect the respective anabolic and antiresorptive mechanisms of action.

19913917,"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is associated with lower body adiposity.OBJECTIVE: To characterize the obesity phenotype(s) in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). DESIGN: Database study. PARTICIPANTS: We studied 44 consecutive patients with IIH, in addition to 184 women attending the obesity clinic of the same medical center and 199 obese women participating in the first Israeli national survey on health and nutrition conducted in 1999 and 2000. METHODS: Anthropometric parameters were compared with those of 2 control groups of the same age range. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight, height, and waist and <e>hip</e> circumference were measured. RESULTS: Forty subjects, comprising 91.0% of this cohort, were either overweight (body mass index, 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)) or obese (body mass index &gt; or = 30 kg/m2). Mean waist circumference was 95.3 cm for IIH, 99.8 cm for the national survey, and 114.5 cm for the obesity clinic cohort (P&lt;0.001), whereas hip circumference was 121 cm for IIH, 118.4 cm for the national survey, and 125.8 cm (P = not significant) for the obesity clinic cohorts. Waist-to-hip ratio, a descriptive measure of body fat distribution approximately reflecting upper to lower body fat ratio, was 0.79 in the patients with IIH, 0.84 in the national survey group, and 0.91 in the obesity clinic cohort (P&lt;0.001; all comparisons were adjusted for age and body mass index). CONCLUSIONS: In IIH, fat tends to preferentially accumulate in the lower body relative to other obese women of the same range. Whereas most complications of obesity, such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome, are linked to upper body adiposity, IIH may represent a unique condition potentially induced by nonvisceral fat-related mechanisms.

19913521,"Soleus H-reflex graded depression by contralateral <e>hip</e> afferent feedback in humans.The aim of this study was to establish the effects of contralateral hip oscillations on the ipsilateral soleus H-reflex. A servomotor system was utilized to impose bilateral hip oscillations at 0.5 Hz, while braces stabilized the joint position of both legs. The soleus H-reflex was evoked every 4 s during bilateral synchronous and asynchronous hip movements and during unilateral hip oscillations with the contralateral leg hyperextended or flexed. In all experimental conditions, a stimulus was delivered to the posterior tibial nerve while the ipsilateral leg was moving either into extension or flexion. Torques at the hip and ankle joints and activity from six muscles were recorded from both legs. The ipsilateral soleus H-reflex was profoundly depressed in all conditions. The reflex depression was less during asynchronous than synchronous hip oscillations. Further, the soleus H-reflex depression did not vary with the contralateral hip flexed or extended, but it was larger when the ipsilateral hip was moving in flexion. These findings demonstrate that sensory afferent feedback from the contralateral hip adjusts the amount of inhibition acting on the ipsilateral soleus H-reflex, supporting cross-leg reflex and heteronymous muscle afferents interactions in humans.",M1
19910816,"Kinematic analysis of the powerlifting style squat and the conventional deadlift during competition: is there a cross-over effect between lifts?Many individuals involved in the sport of powerlifting believe that the squat and deadlift have such similar lifting characteristics that the lifts yield comparable training results. The aim of this study was to compare and contrast biomechanical parameters between the conventional style deadlift and the back squat performed by 25 lifters competing in regional powerlifting championship. The 3-dimensional analysis incorporated 4 60 Hz synchronized video cameras for collecting data from 25 participants. Parameters were quantified at the sticking point specific to each lift. Kinematic variables were calculated at the <e>hip</e>, knee, and ankle. Paired (samples) t-tests were used to detect significant differences in the kinematic mean scores for the different lift types. The statistical analysis revealed significant differences exist between the squat (0.09 m/s) and the deadlift (0.20 m/s) vertical bar velocities. Differences were found for angular position of the hip, knee, and ankle between lifts. The sticking point thigh angles were quantified as 32.54 +/- 3.02 and 57.42 +/- 4.57 for the squat and deadlift, respectively. Trunk angles were 40.58 +/- 6.29 (squat) and 58.30 +/- 7.15 (deadlift). The results indicate the back squat represents a synergistic or simultaneous movement, whereas the deadlift demonstrates a sequential or segmented movement. The kinematic analysis of the squat and the conventional deadlift indicate that the individual lifts are markedly different (p &lt; 0.01), implying that no direct or specific cross-over effect exists between the individual lifts.",M1
19910807,"Electromyographic analysis of the gluteus medius in five weight-bearing exercises.Weight-bearing exercises are frequently used to train and strengthen muscles of the <e>hip</e>. These exercises have been advocated in the rehabilitation of a variety of hip and knee dysfunctions. Limited evidence is available to describe the level of muscle activation occurring with specific weight-bearing exercises. The purpose of this study was to investigate the level of activation of the gluteus medius muscle as measured by electromyographic (EMG) signal amplitude in 5 weight-bearing exercises. Twenty healthy subjects aged 21 to 30 years participated in the study. The EMG surface electrodes were positioned over the muscle belly of the gluteus medius. Subjects performed 5 exercises that consisted of bilateral stance, single limb stance, single limb stance on both a firm surface and an Airex cushion, and single limb squat on a firm surface and an Airex cushion. Statistical differences (rho &lt; 0.05) in gluteus medius EMG values were found between single limb stance as compared with double limb stance, and single limb squat as compared with single limb stance. Single limb stance places more demands on the gluteus medius than double limb stance, whereas single limb squats are more demanding than single limb stance. Although exercises performed on an Airex cushion produced greater EMG values as compared with a firm surface, the difference was not statistically significant. The results, however, suggest that if the goal is to increase the challenge to the gluteus medius, dynamic, single limb exercises performed on unstable surfaces, such as a balance cushion, may place greater demands on the gluteus medius than similar exercises performed on stable surfaces.",M1
19897166,"The relationship between <e>hip</e> rotation range of movement and low back pain prevalence in amateur golfers: an observational study.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether amateur golfers with self-reported low back pain have reduced hip rotation compared to asymptomatic controls. DESIGN: Observational case-control study. SETTING: Data collection took place at 2 amateur golf clubs in southern England. PARTICIPANTS: On initial contact, all participants completed a screening questionnaire used to allocate participants into LBP (n=28) and control groups (n=36). LBP group were found to be heavier than controls (t=2.242, 95% CI 0.763-13.332) but were matched for age, height, handedness, handicap, rounds played per week and years of play. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were lead and non-lead hip medial and lateral rotation in 0 degrees of flexion as measured by inclinometer. Secondary measures included inter and intra-rater reliability. RESULTS: The LBP group had significantly reduced lead hip passive (LBP 21.14+/-10.17 degrees; controls 31.06+/-8.06 degrees, t=-4.228, 95% CI -14.621--5.205) and lead hip active medial rotation (LBP 21.46+/-10.01; controls 28.06+/-7.49 degrees, t=-2.908, 95% CI -11.147--2.036) compared to controls. No between group differences were found in non-lead hips or any passive or active lateral rotation measures. CONCLUSION: Although there is lack of causality between LBP and hip rotation, the deficit in lead leg medial hip rotation in amateur golfers who suffer LBP may be relevant for screening or treatment selection.",M1

19887155,"Injury risk curves for the skeletal knee-thigh-<e>hip</e> complex for knee-impact loading.Injury risk curves for the skeletal knee-thigh-hip (KTH) relate peak force applied to the anterior aspect of the flexed knee, the primary source of KTH injury in frontal motor-vehicle crashes, to the probability of skeletal KTH injury. Previous KTH injury risk curves have been developed from analyses of peak knee-impact force data from studies where knees of whole cadavers were impacted. However, these risk curves either neglect the effects of occupant gender, stature, and mass on KTH fracture force, or account for them using scaling factors derived from dimensional analysis without empirical support. A large amount of experimental data on the knee-impact forces associated with KTH fracture are now available, making it possible to estimate the effects of subject characteristics on skeletal KTH injury risk by statistically analyzing empirical data. Eleven studies were identified in the biomechanical literature in which the flexed knees of whole cadavers were impacted. From these, peak knee-impact force data and the associated subject characteristics were reanalyzed using survival analysis with a lognormal distribution. Results of this analysis indicate that the relationship between peak knee-impact force and the probability of KTH fracture is a function of age, total body mass, and whether the surface that loads the knee is rigid. Comparisons between injury risk curves for the midsize adult male and small adult female crash test dummies defined in previous studies and new risk curves for these sizes of occupants developed in this study suggest that previous injury risk curves generally overestimate the likelihood of KTH fracture at a given peak knee-impact force. Future work should focus on defining the relationships between impact force at the human knee and peak axial compressive forces measured by load cells in the crash test dummy KTH complex so that these new risk curves can be used with ATDs.",M1
19884441,"Assessment of <e>hip</e> abductor muscle strength. A validity and reliability study.BACKGROUND: Hip abductors are the most important muscles around the hip joint. It is therefore essential to assess their function in a valid and reliable way. Since the optimal body posture for the assessment of hip abductor strength is unknown, we tested the validity and reliability of unilateral hip abductor strength assessment in three different body positions. We hypothesized that the validity would be better in the side-lying position because of the consistent stabilization of the contralateral (untested) hip. METHODS: Sixteen healthy subjects participated in two identical testing sessions. Unilateral isometric hip abductor muscle strength was measured, with use of a stabilized commercial dynamometer, with the subject in the side-lying, supine, and standing positions. Construct validity was based on concomitant recordings of gluteus medius electromyographic activity from the tested and contralateral hips. The body position permitting greater muscle activation and abductor strength on the tested hip, while minimizing muscle activation in the contralateral hip (that is, lower contralateral-to-tested electromyographic ratio), was considered the most valid. Coefficients of variation, the Bland and Altman limits of agreement, and intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to determine test-retest reliability of hip abductor strength. RESULTS: Maximal hip abductor strength was significantly higher in the side-lying position compared with the standing and supine positions (p &lt; 0.05). The contralateral-to-tested electromyographic ratio for the side-lying position was significantly lower than that for the supine and the standing position (p &lt; 0.01). Test-retest reliability of strength measurements in terms of coefficients of variation (3.7% for side-lying, 6.1% for supine, and 4.2% for standing) and limits of agreement (+/-6.9% for side-lying, +/-8.4% for supine, and +/-7.5% for standing) was better in the side-lying position. All intraclass correlation coefficients were high to moderate (0.90 for side-lying, 0.83 for supine, and 0.88 for standing). CONCLUSIONS: The side-lying body position offers the most valid and reliable assessment of unilateral hip abductor strength.",M1
19850468,"The influence of chemotherapy on bone mineral density, quantitative ultrasonometry and bone turnover in pre-menopausal women with breast cancer.INTRODUCTION: The effects of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (A/C; 6 cycles) chemotherapy on bone mineral density (BMD), quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) and bone turnover markers in pre-menopausal women with oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer (BC) were compared with age-matched controls. METHODS: Among 106 women (BC=53, controls=53), BMD (spine and <e>hip</e>), QUS (calcaneus and phalanges) and bone marker levels were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Correlations between parameters were determined by Spearman's rho. RESULTS: All BC patients became amenorrhoeic after chemotherapy and remained so for the duration of treatment. BC patients had significant bone loss at all sites (P.005) and significant increases in bone turnover (P.05). There were significant correlations between BMD, QUS and bone markers (P.05). CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm A/C's deleterious influence on bone health in pre-menopausal women with BC and established QUS's utility for monitoring bone effects. Large-scale longitudinal studies are needed to further understand and prevent bone changes following chemotherapy.",M1
19849859,"Biomechanical analysis of the relation between movement time and joint moment development during a sit-to-stand task.BACKGROUND: Slowness of movement is a factor that may cause a decrease of quality of daily life. Mobility in the elderly and people with movement impairments may be improved by increasing the quickness of fundamental locomotor tasks. Because it has not been revealed how much muscle strength is required to improve quickness, the purpose of this study was to reveal the relation between movement time and the required muscle strength in a sit to stand (STS) task. Previous research found that the sum of the peak <e>hip</e> and knee joint moments was relatively invariant throughout a range of movement patterns (Yoshioka et al., 2007, Biomedical Engineering Online 6:26). The sum of the peak hip and knee joint moment is an appropriate index to evaluate the muscle strength required for an STS task, since the effect of the movement pattern variation can be reduced, that is, the results can be evaluated purely from the viewpoint of the movement times. Therefore, the sum of the peak hip and knee joint moment was used as the index to indicate the required muscle strength. METHODS: Experimental kinematics data were collected from 11 subjects. The time at which the vertical position of the right shoulder fell outside three standard deviations of the vertical positions during the static initial posture was regarded as the start time. The time at which the vertical position fell within three standard deviations of the vertical positions during static upright standing posture was regarded as the finish time. Each movement time of the experimental movements was linearly lengthened and shortened through post-processing. Combining the experimental procedure and the post-processing, movements having various movement patterns and a wide range of movement times were obtained. The joint moment and the static and inertial components of the joint moment were calculated with an inverse dynamics method. The static component reflects the gravitational and/or external forces, while the inertial component reflects the acceleration of the body. RESULTS: The quantitative relation between the movement time and the sum of the peak hip and knee joint moments were obtained. As the STS movement time increased, the joint moments decreased exponentially and converged to the static component (1.51 approximately 1.54 N.m/kg). When the movement time was the longest (movement time: 7.0 seconds), the joint moments (1.57 N.m/kg) closely corresponded to the minimum of 1.53 N.m/kg as reported by Yoshioka et al.. CONCLUSION: The key findings of this study are as follows. (1) The minimum required joint moment for an STS task is essentially equivalent to the static component of the joint moment. (2) For fast and moderate speed movements (less than 2.5 seconds), joint moments increased exponentially as the movement speed increased. (3) For slow movements greater than 2.5 seconds, the joint moments were relatively constant. The results of this STS research has practical applications, especially in rehabilitations and exercise prescription where improved movement time is an intended target, since the required muscle strength can be quantitatively estimated.",M1
19838978,"Does the <e>hip</e> reflect the centre of mass swimming kinematics?The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the hip point and the centre of mass for kinematical parameters (displacement, velocity and acceleration) in the three axes of motion. One complete stroke cycle was analyzed in eight swimmers performing a 25 m front crawl swim test at high intensity. Within-subject correlation coefficients were computed between the centre of mass and both hips, as well as mean of the errors, RMS error and a paired sample t-test. High correlation coefficients were found for the displacement in the horizontal direction (r=1.00 for both hips) and low to moderate correlation coefficients (r=-0.01 to r=0.54) were found for all other studied variables. Moreover, moderate to large RMS errors were observed: (i) between 0.05 and 0.15 for the displacement; (ii) between 0.16 and 0.30 for the velocity and (iii) between 5.28 and 7.86 for the acceleration. Complementarily, RMS errors for the intracyclic velocity variation were between 0.07 and 0.18. Considering the centre of mass and hip values statistical differences were found in velocity in x, acceleration in x and y, and intracyclic velocity variation in y axes. Therefore, results suggest that the hip point does not represent most kinematical parameters of the estimated centre of mass in front crawl swimming.",M1

METHODS: This was a prospective multicentre cohort study involving individuals who had received antiretroviral therapy for at least 40 weeks and who were enrolled in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Longitudinal Linked Randomized Trials cohort. There were 2,223 participants in the statin-unexposed group and 371 in the statin-exposed group. The main outcome measure was change in hip circumference at week 32. RESULTS: The 32-week change in hip circumference in the statin-exposed group was 0.60 cm greater (95% confidence interval 0.11-1.10; P=0.02) than in the statin-unexposed group after adjustment for age, gender, race, baseline body mass index and thymidine analogue exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that statins might be beneficial in lipoatrophy. Given the limited treatment options for this important problem, further studies are needed to confirm this effect and to determine its clinical significance.",M1
19771287,"Eccentric <e>hip</e> muscle function in females with and without patellofemoral pain syndrome.CONTEXT: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common knee condition in athletes. Recently, researchers have indicated that factors proximal to the knee, including hip muscle weakness and motor control impairment, contribute to the development of PFPS. However, no investigators have evaluated eccentric hip muscle function in people with PFPS. OBJECTIVE: To compare the eccentric hip muscle function between females with PFPS and a female control group. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Musculoskeletal laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: two groups of females were studied: a group with PFPS (n = 10) and a group with no history of lower extremity injury or surgery (n = 10). INTERVENTION(S): Eccentric torque of the hip musculature was evaluated on an isokinetic dynamometer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Eccentric hip abduction, adduction, and external and internal rotation peak torque were measured and expressed as a percentage of body mass (Nm/kg x 100). We also evaluated eccentric hip adduction to abduction and internal to external rotation torque ratios. The peak torque value of 5 maximal eccentric contractions was used for calculation. Two-tailed, independent-samples t tests were used to compare torque results between groups. RESULTS: Participants with PFPS exhibited much lower eccentric hip abduction (t(18) = -2.917, P = .008) and adduction (t(18) = -2.764, P = .009) peak torque values than did their healthy counterparts. No differences in eccentric hip external (t(18) = 0.45, P = .96) or internal (t(18) = -0.742, P = .47) rotation peak torque values were detected between the groups. The eccentric hip adduction to abduction torque ratio was much higher in the PFPS group than in the control group (t(18) = 2.113, P = .04), but we found no difference in the eccentric hip internal to external rotation torque ratios between the 2 groups (t(18) = -0.932, P = .36). CONCLUSIONS: Participants with PFPS demonstrated lower eccentric hip abduction and adduction peak torque and higher eccentric adduction to abduction torque ratios when compared with control participants. Thus, clinicians should consider eccentric hip abduction strengthening exercises when developing rehabilitation programs for females with PFPS.",M1

19735752,"Analysis of <e>hip</e> geometry by clinical CT for the assessment of hip fracture risk in elderly Japanese women.Two case-control studies were designed to investigate the contribution of the geometry and bone mineral density (BMD) of the proximal femur to bone strength in Japanese elderly women. We also investigated whether clinical CT is useful to assess the risk of hip fracture. Subjects in the neck fracture study included 20 Japanese women with neck fracture (age: mean+/-SD; 80.1+/-4.5 years old) and 20 age-matched control women (79.2+/-2.6 years old). Subjects in the trochanteric fracture study included 16 Japanese women with trochanteric fracture (82.6+/-5.0 years old) and 16 age-matched control women (80.8+/-3.8 years old). CT examination of the proximal femur was performed between the date of admission and the date of surgery. The CT scanners used were an Aquillion 16 (Toshiba) and Somatom 64 (Siemens); the scanning conditions including spatial resolution and scanning energy were adjusted, and the same type of reference phantom containing hydroxyapatite was used. QCT PRO software (Mindways) was used to analyze data for BMD, geometry, and biomechanical parameters. Both the neck and trochanteric fracture cases had significantly lower total and cortical BMD, a significantly smaller cortical cross-sectional area (CSA), and a larger trabecular CSA. Both had significantly thinner cortex and smaller distance to center of bone mass, and women with trochanteric fracture had a significantly smaller cortical perimeter in the cross-sectional femoral neck. Women with neck fracture had a longer hip axis length (HAL) and women with trochanteric fracture had a significantly larger neck-shaft angle (NSA). Both groups had significantly lower cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI), and only women with neck fracture had a significantly higher buckling ratio (BR) compared to their respective controls. According to the multiple logistic regression analysis, women with neck fracture had a significantly longer HAL, lower CSMI, and higher BR, and women with trochanteric fracture had a significantly smaller cortical CSA of the femoral neck. We conclude that clinical CT may be useful for the assessment of the risk of neck and trochanteric fracture.",M1
19726188,"Effect of prolonged bed rest on the anterior <e>hip</e> muscles.Prolonged bed rest and inactivity is known to cause muscular atrophy with previous research indicating that muscles involved in joint stabilisation are more susceptible. The anterior hip muscles are important for hip joint function and stability but little is known about the effects of prolonged inactivity on their function. This study investigated the effect of prolonged bed rest on the size of the anterior hip muscles and their pattern of recovery. The effect of resistive vibration exercise (RVE) as a countermeasure to muscle atrophy was also investigated. 12 male participants, randomly assigned to either a control or an exercise group, underwent 8 weeks of bed rest with 6 months follow-up. Changes in muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) of the iliacus, psoas, iliopsoas, sartorius and rectus femoris muscles were measured by magnetic resonance imaging at regular intervals during bed rest and recovery phases. CSAs of iliopsoas and sartorius decreased at the hip joint (p&lt;0.05) during bed rest but iliacus, psoas, and rectus femoris CSAs were unchanged (p&gt;0.05). No significant difference was found between the two groups for all muscles (all p&gt;0.1), suggesting inefficacy of the countermeasure in this sample. These findings suggest that prolonged bed rest can result in the atrophy of specific muscles across the hip joint which may affect its stability and function.",M1
19711005,"Brucellosis <e>hip</e> abscess without risk factor.Brucellosis has become a rare entity in many industrialised countries, because of animal vaccination programs. We report a first case in the literature of Brucella abscess in the hip region observed in Switzerland in a subject without any clear risk factor, leading us to conclude that abscess formation can be a rare manifestation of brucellosis. Because it can present in many different forms and locations without having characteristic clinics, a high index of suspicion is needed for the diagnosis even if the patient is a healthy athlete with no clear way of obvious route for contamination, and this even more if all the common causes of athletic hip pain have been ruled out.",M1
19705765,"Kinetic analyses of maximal effort soccer kicks in female collegiate athletes.To determine the effect of plant leg and approach condition on the torques of the <e>hip</e>, knee, and ankle in soccer kicking tasks, nine female collegiate soccer players performed a series of kicking tasks from three different approach conditions. Kinematic data of the hip, knee, and ankle were recorded and joint torques of the plant leg were calculated. Peak flexor torque of the hip and ankle was greater for the dominant than the non-dominant plant leg for center and off-axis approach conditions (P &lt; 0.05), while the opposite was true for peak extension torque for the hip and knee (P &lt; 0.05). Similar effects of plant leg dominance emerged for peak internal and external rotation torques as well for peak abduction and adduction torques. In summary, these results indicate that participants use greater pulling torques and smaller braking torques in the dominant plant leg compared with the non-dominant plant leg. Thus, even in collegiate athletes who train to be able to kick efficiently with either leg, differences in peak joint torques emerge between the dominant and non-dominant plant legs, particularly when participants kick from an off-axis approach.",M1
19699565,"Creation of an asymmetrical gradient of back muscle activity and spinal stiffness during asymmetrical <e>hip</e> extension.BACKGROUND: Low back pain is often associated with increased spinal stiffness which thought to arise from increased muscle activity. Unfortunately, the association between paraspinal muscle activity and paraspinal stiffness, as well as the spatial distribution of this relation, is unknown. The purpose of this investigation was to employ new technological developments to determine the relation between spinal muscle contraction and spinal stiffness over a large region of the lumbar spine. METHODS: Thirty-two male subjects performed graded isometric prone right hip extension at four different exertion levels (0%, 10%, 25% and 50% of the maximum voluntary contraction) to induce asymmetric back muscle activity. The corresponding stiffness and muscle activity over bilateral paraspinal lumbar regions was measured by indentation loading and topography surface electromyography, respectively. Paraspinal stiffness and muscle activity were then plotted and their correlation was determined. FINDINGS: Data from this study demonstrated the existence of an asymmetrical gradient in muscle activation and paraspinal stiffness in the lumbar spine during isometric prone right hip extension. The magnitude and scale of the gradient increased with the contraction force. A positive correlation between paraspinal stiffness and paraspinal muscle activity existed irrespective of the hip extension effort (Pearson correlation coefficient, range 0.566-0.782 (P&lt;0.001)). INTERPRETATION: Our results demonstrate the creation of an asymmetrical gradient of muscle activity and paraspinal stiffness during right hip extension. Future studies will determine if alterations in this gradient may possess diagnostic or prognostic value for patients with low back pain.",M1
19690659,"The value of calcaneal bone mass measurement using a dual X-ray laser Calscan device in risk screening for osteoporosis.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how bone mineral density in the calcaneus measured by a dual energy X-ray laser (DXL) correlates with bone mineral density in the spine and <e>hip</e> in Turkish women over 40 years of age and to determine whether calcaneal dual energy X-ray laser variables are associated with clinical risk factors to the same extent as axial bone mineral density measurements obtained using dual energy x-ray absorbtiometry (DXA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2,884 Turkish women, aged 40-90 years, living in Ankara were randomly selected. Calcaneal bone mineral density was evaluated using a dual energy X-ray laser Calscan device. Subjects exhibiting a calcaneal dual energy X-ray laser T- score &lt; or = -2.5 received a referral for DXA of the spine and hip. Besides dual energy X-ray laser measurements, all subjects were questioned about their medical history and the most relevant risk factors for osteoporosis. RESULTS: Using a T-score threshold of -2.5, which is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), dual energy X-ray laser calcaneal measurements showed that 13% of the subjects had osteoporosis, while another 56% had osteopenia. The mean calcaneal dual energy X-ray laser T-score of postmenopausal subjects who were smokers with a positive history of fracture, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), covered dressing style, lower educational level, no regular exercise habits, and low tea consumption was significantly lower than that obtained for the other group (p&lt;0.05). A significant correlation was observed between the calcaneal dual energy X-ray laser T-score and age (r= -0.465, p=0.001), body mass index (BMI) (r=0.223, p=0.001), number of live births (r= -0.229, p=0.001), breast feeding time (r= -0.064, p=0.001), and age at menarche (r= -0.050, p=0.008). The correlations between calcaneal DXL and DXA T-scores (r=0.340, p=0.001) and calcaneal DXL and DXA Z-scores (r=0.360, p=0.001) at the spine, and calcaneal DXL and DXA T- scores (r=0.28, p=0.001) and calcaneal DXL and DXA Z-scores (r=0.33, p=0.001) at the femoral neck were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Bone mineral density measurements in the calcaneus using a dual energy X-ray laser are valuable for screening Turkish women over 40 years of age for the risk of osteoporosis.",M1

19679506,"Prone <e>hip</e> extension with lower abdominal hollowing improves the relative timing of gluteus maximus activation in relation to biceps femoris.Hamstring injuries are common. The hamstrings and gluteus maximus (GM) work as synergists during hip extension. When contraction of GM is delayed relative to Biceps Femoris (BF) the hamstrings may be predisposed to injury due to increased demand. This study investigated whether specific training affected neuromuscular control of BF and GM during Prone Hip Extension (PHE). Twenty healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to the intervention or the control group. Mean onset times for BF and GM during PHE were recorded via surface electromyography (sEMG). The intervention group performed a 10min exercise with focus on proximal to distal muscle activation involving abdominal hollowing and active GM contraction prior to PHE. The control group undertook an exercise which included only PHE. Post exercise descriptive analysis indicated that the intervention exercise reduced the delay of GM firing relative to BF, however, when baseline differences between the two groups are taken into account as a covariant, the difference attributable to the intervention is not statistically significant (P=0.166). The results suggest that a short duration exercise intervention has the potential to alter the timing of activation of GM relative to BF during PHE but this needs validation through future research.",M1
19679207,"Long-term treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis with strontium ranelate: results at 8 years.OBJECTIVES: Strontium ranelate 2 g/day has proven efficacy against vertebral and nonvertebral fracture over 5 years in postmenopausal osteoporosis, though many women require longer-term treatment. This article describes the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this agent over 8 years. METHODS: Postmenopausal osteoporotic women having participated in the 5-year efficacy trials SOTI and TROPOS were invited to enter a 3-year open-label extension study. The results presented here focus on patients who received strontium ranelate for 8 years. RESULTS: At the extension baseline, the population treated for 8 years (n=879; 79.1+/-5.6 years) had femoral neck T-score of -2.61+/-0.71. The cumulative incidences of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures (13.7% and 12.0%, respectively) over years 6 to 8 were non-statistically different from the cumulative incidences in the first 3 years of the original studies (11.5% and 9.6%). Lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total <e>hip</e> bone mineral density (BMD) increased throughout the 8-year period. Annual relative change in BMD was significant at every visit, except the 8-year visit for femoral neck and total hip BMD. Strontium ranelate was safe and well tolerated over 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with strontium ranelate 2 g/day in postmenopausal osteoporotic women leads to continued increases in BMD at all sites. The data also provide some evidence for a sustained antifracture efficacy.",M1

19656435,"Life-course socio-economic factors, skin colour and abdominal obesity in adulthood in a Brazilian birth cohort.OBJECTIVE: Obesity is an increasingly prevalent nutritional disorder throughout the world. In particular, abdominal obesity is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of skin colour and life-course socio-economic indicators on waist circumference (WC), <e>hip</e> circumference (HC) and waist:hip ratio (WHR) in young adults. DESIGN: Population-based birth cohort study. Individuals born in 1982 in Pelotas (southern Brazil) were visited on a number of occasions from birth to age 23-24 years. A sample of the cohort was sought in 2006 and 972 individuals were located. The analysis was restricted to individuals with complete data available (442 males, 414 females). RESULTS: In men, family income at birth and in 2004-5 were positively associated with WC and HC, but not with WHR. Regardless of current income, men born to wealthier families had larger WC and HC as adults. Skin colour was not associated with any of the outcomes. In women, early poverty was associated with smaller HC, and current poverty with larger WC. Poverty at any age thus led to higher WHR. Black women had larger WC and HC than white women, but there were no differences in WHR. All the associations were partially mediated by education and behavioural variables. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of early socio-economic position on WC and HC persist even after adjustment for adult socio-economic position, highlighting the importance of interventions during the first years of life.",M1

19644695,"Total femur replacement.BACKGROUND: Total femoral replacement after massive resection of bone and soft tissue sarcoma of the thigh can restore femoral integrity and allow patients to resume ambulation, albeit at a compromised level. This compromised functional capacity is superior to that achieved after <e>hip</e> disarticulation. Most reports of total femoral replacements are isolated case studies. Only few reported series have been identified. METHODS: We treated nine consecutive patients by total femur resection and reconstruction with total femur replacement between 1993 and 2007. Four had a primary malignant bone tumor, four had a primary malignant soft-tissue tumor, and one had a metastatic disease. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 51 (8-200) months, four patients were still alive, whereas five patients died of malignant disease. Mechanical loosening of the tibial component was seen in one patient. Infection was encountered in two patients. Four patients had excellent outcomes. Competence of the extensor mechanism is the major determinant of functional outcome of these patients. The flexion range of knee motion ranged from 20 to 120 degrees (mean 60 degrees ). According to Enneking's functional evaluation method, the function ranged from 30 to 93% (mean 72%). Using the International Society of Limb Salvage radiographic evaluation method, all the available radiographs show excellent results. Excellent results also were seen for the radiographic evaluation of the hip. CONCLUSION: Endoprosthetic femoral replacement is a reliable mean to restore mechanical and functional results after extensive resection of the femur.",M1
19642016,"Associations between osteoprotegerin polymorphisms and bone mineral density: a meta-analysis.Associations between polymorphisms of the osteoprotegerin gene (OPG) and bone mineral density (BMD) have been studied by several research groups, but results are mixed. Accordingly, the authors performed a meta-analysis on studies of associations between OPG polymorphisms and BMD. Appropriate studies were identified using MEDLINE and by manual searching. A total of eight separate comparisons were considered in this meta-analysis. Individuals with the GG genotype of G1181C were found to have a significantly lower mean lumbar BMD than subjects with the CC genotype (WMDs -0.051 g/cm(2), 95% confidence interval -0.079--0.023, P &lt; 0.001), and similar results were obtained in European and Asian populations. In contrast to G1181C, no association was found between the A163G and T950C polymorphisms and lumbar BMD. In terms of femoral neck BMD, the GG genotype of G1181C was associated with a significantly lower BMD than the CC genotype in Europeans but not in Asians. Total <e>hip</e> BMD was lower for the GG genotype of G1181C than for the CC or GC genotypes in Europeans. A difference in total hip BMD was found between the AG and GG genotypes of the A163G polymorphism by meta-analyses in Europeans, but no differences were found between the genotypes of the T950C polymorphism and total hip BMD in Europeans. Summarizing, the present study demonstrates that the OPG G1181C polymorphism is associated with lumbar BMD in Europeans and Asians, and with femoral neck and total hip BMD in Europeans only.",M1

19631303,"Four-month treatment with GLP-2 significantly increases <e>hip</e> BMD: a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in postmenopausal women with low BMD.We have previously shown that repeated dosing of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) at 10 p.m. in postmenopausal women for 14 days results in a dose-dependent decrease in the nocturnal bone resorption, as assessed by s-CTX. In contrast, bone formation, as assessed by serum osteocalcin, appeared to be unaffected by treatment with exogenous GLP-2, at least over 14 days. The present study extends the observation period to four months. The study was a double-blind placebo-controlled dose-ranging trial comparing three different doses of GLP-2 (0.4 mg, 1.6 mg and 3.2 mg GLP-2, administered nightly) against a saline control injection. We examined safety and tolerability, and the effects on biochemical markers of bone turnover and the effect on bone mineral density. Injection of 0.4 mg, 1.6 mg and 3.2 mg GLP-2 resulted in similar reduction in the nocturnal rise of s-CTX, at Treatment Day 120 the mean difference to placebo was approximately -150%*h at AUC(0-10H) (P&lt;0.01). Osteocalcin levels were unaffected in the 10-hour period after injection indicating that injections of 0.4 mg, 1.6 mg and 3.2 mg GLP-2 do not exert any acute stimulatory or inhibitory effect on bone formation. Treatment with GLP-2 resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in total hip BMD over the course of the study that for the 3.2 mg GLP-2 group reached 1.1% (P=0.007) from baseline. The overall rates of adverse events in the 4 treatment groups were similar and there were no signs of tachyphylaxis or antibodies against GLP-2. The results indicate that GLP-2 produces a substantial decrease in bone resorption without suppression of bone formation thereby changing the bone remodeling balance in favor of bone formation, particularly at the hip.",M1

We prospectively followed 38 patients (38 hips, Group 1) having primary THA with the conventional technique and 31 patients (31 hips, Group 2) using the surgical guide. We designed the guide for Group 2 based on CT images and fixed it to the acetabular edge with a Kirschner wire to indicate the planned cup direction. Postoperative CT images showed the guide reduced the number of outliers compared with the conventional method (Group 1, 23.7%; Group 2, 0%).

Denosumab binds to RANKL and is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption that has been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and decrease fracture risk in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. This was a multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study in 504 postmenopausal women &gt; or = 55 years of age with a BMD T-score of -2.0 or less and -4.0 or more who had been receiving alendronate therapy for at least 6 months. Subjects received open-label branded alendronate 70 mg once weekly for 1 month and then were randomly assigned to either continued weekly alendronate therapy or subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg every 6 months and were followed for 12 months. Changes in BMD and biochemical markers of bone turnover were evaluated. In subjects transitioning to denosumab, total <e>hip</e> BMD increased by 1.90% at month 12 compared with a 1.05% increase in subjects continuing on alendronate (p &lt; .0001). Significantly greater BMD gains with denosumab compared with alendronate also were achieved at 12 months at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and 1/3 radius (all p &lt; .0125). Median serum CTX levels remained near baseline in the alendronate group and were significantly decreased versus alendronate (p &lt; .0001) at all time points with denosumab. Adverse events and serious adverse events were balanced between groups. No clinical hypocalcemic adverse events were reported. Transition to denosumab produced greater increases in BMD at all measured skeletal sites and a greater reduction in bone turnover than did continued alendronate with a similar safety profile in both groups.",M1

We used femur BMD data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 to estimate the prevalence of low femoral BMD in adults age 50 years and older and compared it with estimates from NHANES III (1988-1994). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry systems (pencil-beam geometry in NHANES III, fan-beam geometry in NHANES 2005-2006) were used to measure femur BMD, and World Health Organization (WHO) definitions of low BMD were used to categorize skeletal status. In 2005-2006, 49% of older US women had osteopenia and 10% had osteoporosis at the femur neck. In men, 30% had femur neck osteopenia and 2% had femur neck osteoporosis. An estimated 5.3 million older men and women had osteoporosis at the femur neck, and 34.5 million more had osteopenia in 2005-2006. When compared with NHANES III, the age-adjusted prevalence of femur neck osteoporosis in NHANES 2005-2006 was lower in men (by 3 percentage units) and women (by 7 percentage units) overall and among non-Hispanic whites. Changes in body mass index or osteoporosis medication use between surveys did not fully explain the decline in osteoporosis. Owing to the increase in the number of older adults in the US population, however, more older adults had low femur neck BMD (osteoporosis + osteopenia) in 2005-2006 than in 1988-1994. Thus, despite the decline in prevalence, the estimated number of affected older adults in 2005-2006 remained high.",M1

DESIGN: Pretest-posttest. SETTING: University research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy young women (n=20; age, 23.0+/-1.5y; height, 166.52+/-4.5 cm; mass, 65.33+/-10.5 kg) and community-dwelling older women (n=20; age, 71.65+/-7.2y; height, 162.31+/-3.8 cm; mass, 71.16+/-11.6 kg) without a fall history. INTERVENTION: Measurements of control of single-limb balance before and after fatiguing the hip abductors of the dominant leg. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Performance on 3 clinical assessments of control of balance: the modified Functional Reach Test in the forward, left, and right directions; the Lower-Extremity Reach Test in forward and lateral directions; and the Single-Limb Stance Time Test (SLSTT). RESULTS: Although the younger subjects showed a significantly greater control of balance than the older women in most tests, control of balance after acute fatigue failed to show a significant decline in either age group. The only exception to this was the SLSTT in the younger women in whom a significant 26% decline was noted (P&lt;.05). CONCLUSIONS: Acute fatigue of the hip abductors did not result in a decreased control of balance in healthy young or older women without fall history. Despite considerable changes in movement strategies used to complete the postfatigue tests of balance, quantitative measures of balance did not decrease.",M1

METHODS: We recruited to the study 92 healthy girls aged between 16 and 19. They were divided into three groups. Participants in the first two groups used an OC with either 15 or 30 microg ethinyloestradiol (EE), whereas those in the third group used no hormonal contraception. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers were measured before and after 12 months of treatment. RESULTS: The BMD values of the total <e>hip</e> in females using the OC containing 30 microg EE was 0.912 g/cm(2) at baseline and 0.918 g/cm(2) after one year; in females using the OC containing 15 microg EE the corresponding values were 0.888 g/cm(2) and 0.895 g/cm(2) whereas in females who used no contraception BMD values were 0.942 g/cm(2) and 0.949 g/cm(2), respectively. The changes were statistically insignificant. Levels of osteocalcin and CTX had decreased after one year in all groups, but not statistically significantly so.

19550430,"Beer consumption and the 'beer belly': scientific basis or common belief?BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The term 'beer belly' expresses the common belief that beer consumption is a major determinant of waist circumference (WC). We studied the gender-specific associations between beer consumption and WC (partially in relation to body weight and <e>hip</e> circumference (HC) change). PARTICIPANTS/METHODS: Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study (7876 men, 12 749 women), cross-sectional associations were investigated applying general linear models. Prospective analyses of baseline beer consumption and an 8.5-year WC change were assessed using multivariate general linear models and polytomous logistic regression. To test the site-specific effect of beer consumption on WC, an adjustment for concurrent changes in body weight and HC was carried out. In addition, the relationship between change in beer consumption and change in WC was studied. RESULTS: A positive association in men and no association in women were seen between beer consumption and WC at baseline. Men consuming 1000 ml/d beer were at 17% higher risk for WC gain compared with very light consumers. Significantly lower odds for WC gain (odds ratio=0.88; 95% confidence interval 0.81, 0.96) were found in beer-abstaining women than in very-light-drinking women. The adjustment for concurrent body weight and HC change diminished effect estimates notably, explaining most of the association between beer and change in WC. Decreasing beer consumption was related to higher relative odds for WC loss, although not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Beer consumption leads to WC gain, which is closely related to concurrent overall weight gain. This study does not support the common belief of a site-specific effect of beer on the abdomen, the beer belly.",M1

It is considered that early identification of this condition allows for optimal management. Eighty-six players from two elite under-age Australian football sides were screened weekly for hip adductor muscle strength, using a hand-held dynamometer and for the onset of groin pain. The maximum variation in the average hip adductor muscle strength values of the sample was a 2.6% decrease from baseline in week 7 of the study. Twelve players (14% of the sample studied) reported groin pain for two consecutive weeks and were considered to have an onset of groin injury. The mean hip adductor muscle strength of these players was decreased significantly from baseline by an average of 11.75+/-2.50% at the week of pain onset (F=264.76 (1,11), p&lt;0.001), and 5.82+/-5.16% in the week preceding the onset of pain (F=14.03 (1,10), p=0.004).

METHODS: A total of 59 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or osteopenia were included in this prospective study. Subjects were divided into two groups: the study group (SG, n = 30; 57.5 + or - 5.1 years) and the control group (CG, n = 29; 56.6 + or - 4.6 years). In the study group was applied a weight exercise protocol (longitudinal forces in closed kinetic chain) during 12 months, whereas in the control group no weight exercise protocol was applied. Bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and <e>hip</e> was assessed at baseline and at the end of follow-up by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS. Although no significant intragroup differences were found, patients in SG showed a 1.17% increase in the lumbar spine whereas in CG a 2.26% decrease in bone density was detected. CONCLUSION: This protocol of weight training exercise did not significantly improve bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis, but in comparison to the control group, the results showed the importance of practising the specific exercise program for maintenance of bone health in postmenopausal women.",M1
19520372,"Role of stability and limb support in recovery against a fall following a novel slip induced in different daily activities.The purpose of this study was to determine whether stability and limb support play a similar role in governing slip outcome in gait-slip as in sit-to-stand-slip, and whether such prediction could also be derived based on measures of these variables during regular, unperturbed movements. Fifty-three and forty-one young subjects all took one recovery step following an unannounced, novel, forward slip induced in gait and in sit-to-stand, respectively. Logistic regression was used to predict recovery outcome based on preslip and reactive measures of stability and limb support across tasks. Following slip onset, all subjects in both tasks experienced rapid decay in stability and limb support (indicated by a <e>hip</e> descent), leading to some actual falls that could not have been predicted from regular, preslip walking. Immediately before recovery step touchdown, stability and limb support could together best predict 88.9% and 100% falls, respectively, for gait-slip and sit-to-stand-slip. Because of differences in the execution of the recovery step, stability became a better predictor of fallers in sit-to-stand-slip than in gait-slip after recovery limb touchdown. Recovery steps were highly effective in restoring stability, regardless of outcome and task. The predictive strength of stability diminished in gait-slip or reduced in sit-to-stand-slip after recovery touchdown, while limb support remained able to differentiate fallers from those who recovered in both tasks. When slip-induced instability was combined with inadequate limb support, falls were nearly inevitable in both tasks.",M1
19519257,"Effects of application to two different skin sites on the pharmacokinetics of transdermal methylphenidate in pediatric patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to quantify the rate and extent of methylphenidate (MPH) absorption from a transdermal system when applied to two different skin sites in pediatric subjects with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: In an open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-way crossover study, children (6-12 years) with ADHD were randomized to wear one MPH transdermal system (MTS) on the <e>hip</e> area or on the scapular area for 16 hours. The following week, subjects were crossed over to the opposite application site. Serial blood samples were collected after each MTS application and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for d,l-MPH were calculated. Worn MTS units were assayed to calculate the Apparent Dose absorbed from MTS. RESULTS: PK analyses included 23 subjects. Hip and scapular application resulted in quantifiable levels of d,l-MPH, with approximately 31% higher bioavailability upon hip application. Logarithm transformed mean ratios for area under the curve (AUC) and C(max) indicated a lack of equivalence between the two sites. CONCLUSION: MTS applied to both hip and scapular areas resulted in quantifiable plasma levels of d,l-MPH. Bioavailability of MPH from the same transdermal delivery system appears to differ substantially when applied to two different skin surfaces in young children but with similar overall skin effects assessments.",M1
19504101,"Obturator externus bursa: prevalence of communication with the <e>hip</e> joint and associated intra-articular findings in 200 consecutive hip MR arthrograms.The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the prevalence of communication between the hip joint and the obturator externus bursa on hip MR arthrography. Following institutional review board approval, 200 hip MR arthrograms in 196 subjects were independently reviewed by two musculoskeletal radiologists. Discrepancies were resolved by adjudication. The presence or absence of communication between the hip joint and the obturator externus bursa was recorded. Associated lesions involving the acetabular labrum and articular cartilage were recorded. The obturator externus bursa was shown to communicate with the hip joint in 11 of the 200 (5.5%) hip MR arthrograms. Of these, six were in men and five were in women. The age range was 15-63 years with a mean age of 34 years. All 11 patients had labral tears. Eight of the 11 had cartilage lesions. The obturator externus bursa can be seen to communicate with the hip joint in 5.5% of hip MR arthrograms. Associated labral and cartilage lesions are common.",M1
19501681,"The degree and distribution of cortical bone mineralization in the human femoral shaft change with age and sex in a microradiographic study.BACKGROUND: The incidence of osteoporotic <e>hip</e> fractures increases with age, more sharply in women than in men, as a result of qualitative and quantitative bone alterations. Mineralization (a qualitative parameter) showed no differences with age or sex in cancellous bone in earlier studies. Few studies assessed such differences in cortical bone, a major contributor to femoral bone strength. The aim of this in vitro cross-sectional study of a large group of human femoral midshafts was to look for age- and sex-related differences in the degree and distribution of cortical mineralization that might be implicated in bone fragility. METHODS: Cortical bone specimens from 193 femurs were studied using quantitative microradiography, with an aluminum step-wedge reference. The femurs were from 99 females and 94 males in a Caucasian anthropological collection covering a broad age spectrum. We determined the mean degree of mineralization of osteons (On.DMB-Al), interstitial tissue (Int.DMB-Al), and total bone (Tt.DMB-Al), and representative parameters of density histograms. Results were expressed as relative values. Age- and sex-related differences in DMB-Al values were evaluated using non-parametric tests. RESULTS: Degree of tissue mineralization (Tt.DMB-Al) decreased significantly with age in females (r=-0.257; P=0.010) but did not change in males. Tt.DMB-Al was higher in females than males until 50 years of age (P=0.001) but was lower in elderly females than elderly males (P=0.016). DMB-Al distribution varied significantly with sex and age. The first DMB-Al quartiles in osteons and interstitial tissue were not different between males and females, but the third quartile and interquartile range differed significantly (P=0.032 and P=0.000, respectively). The mineralization difference between the two tissues indicated greater bone heterogeneity in females than males (P=0.000). CONCLUSIONS: In this in vitro cross-sectional study of anterior midfemoral cortical specimens, the degree and distribution of mineralization varied with age and sex. In females, mineralization started at a higher level than in males but was lower in the sixth decade, falling below the level in males. Mineralization was far more stable throughout life in males. In elderly females, the lower degree and greater heterogeneity of mineralization may have consequences on bone strength and the risk of fracture.",M1

19494758,"Femoroacetabular impingement in adolescents and young adults.Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a recently described <e>hip</e> disorder resulting from an abnormal morphology between the proximal femur and acetabulum (socket). It is now recognized as a cause of hip pain in adolescents and young adults, and research has shown that it may also lead to early degenerative changes and osteoarthritis. Femoroacetabular impingement as a cause of precocious hip arthrosis was originally described by Ganz et al. in 2001, and a quick literature search on this topic will confirm that it has become a topic of cutting edge research within the orthopaedic community. The abnormal morphology in FAI results in increased hip contact forces with hip motion, especially flexion. This results in abnormal contact that can lead to acetabular labral tears and cartilaginous injury. Early diagnosis and treatment may possibly delay the future onset of hip arthritis. Although the precise cause of FAI is not well understood, the condition has become increasingly recognized as a cause of hip pain in active adolescents and young adults. The purpose of this article is to outline the history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and current conservative and surgical treatment modalities for FAI.",M1
19488892,"Radiographic absorptiometry as a screening tool in male osteoporosis: results from the Odense Androgen Study.BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis screening with dual-energy absorptiometry (DXA) is not recommended due to low diagnostic utility and costs. Radiographic absorptiometry (RA) determines bone mineral density (BMD) of the phalangeal bones of the hand and is a potential osteoporosis pre-screening tool. PURPOSE: To determine the ability of RA to identify patients with osteoporosis in a male population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: As part of the Odense Androgen Study, we measured BMD of the intermediate phalanges of the second to fourth finger, lumbar spine (L2-L4), and total <e>hip</e> in 218 men aged 60-74 years (mean 68.8 years), randomly invited from the population, using RA (MetriScan) and DXA (Hologic 4500-A). Osteopenia and osteoporosis were defined as a T-score of less than -1.0 and -2.5, respectively, in the hip and/or lumbar spine. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) were computed. RESULTS: BMD(RA) of the phalanges correlated significantly with BMD(DXA) of the hip (R=0.47, P&lt;0.001) and lumbar spine (R=0.46, P&lt;0.001). A total of 105 men (48.2%) were osteopenic and 15 (6.9%) osteoporotic. The AUC (SE) value for detecting osteoporosis was 0.75 (0.06). The sensitivity and specificity of RA in identifying osteoporosis were 0.93 and 0.50, respectively. CONCLUSION: BMD(RA) correlated weakly with BMD(DXA) of the lumbar spine and total hip, and RA has a moderate ability to identify osteoporotic individuals. Nevertheless, RA may be used as a pre-screening tool in men, since the diagnosis may be ruled out in half the population at little cost.",M1
19486983,"Knee stiffness is a major determinant of leg stiffness during maximal hopping.Understanding stiffness of the lower extremities during human movement may provide important information for developing more effective training methods during sports activities. It has been reported that leg stiffness during submaximal hopping depends primarily on ankle stiffness, but the way stiffness is regulated in maximal hopping is unknown. The goal of this study was to examine the hypothesis that knee stiffness is a major determinant of leg stiffness during the maximal hopping. Ten well-trained male athletes performed two-legged hopping in place with a maximal effort. We determined leg and joint stiffness of the <e>hip</e>, knee, and ankle from kinetic and kinematic data. Knee stiffness was significantly higher than ankle and hip stiffness. Further, the regression model revealed that only knee stiffness was significantly correlated with leg stiffness. The results of the present study suggest that the knee stiffness, rather than those of the ankle or hip, is the major determinant of leg stiffness during maximal hopping.",M1
19483231,"Variation in bone mineral density by anatomical site in patients with proximal humeral fractures.Low-energy fractures of the proximal humerus indicate osteoporosis and it is important to direct treatment to this group of patients who are at high risk of further fracture. Data were prospectively collected from 79 patients (11 men, 68 women) with a mean age of 69 years (55 to 86) with fractures of the proximal humerus in order to determine if current guidelines on the measurement of the bone mineral density at the <e>hip</e> and lumbar spine were adequate to stratify the risk and to guide the treatment of osteoporosis. Bone mineral density measurements were made by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the proximal femur, lumbar spine (L2-4) and contralateral distal radius, and the T-scores were generated for comparison. Data were also collected on the use of steroids, smoking, the use of alcohol, hand dominance and comorbidity. The mean T-score for the distal radius was -2.97 (SD 1.56) compared with -1.61 (SD 1.62) for the lumbar spine and -1.78 (SD 1.33) for the femur. There was a significant difference between the mean lumbar and radial T scores (1.36 (1.03 to 1.68); p &lt; 0.001) and between the mean femoral and radial T-scores (1.18 (0.92 to 1.44); p &lt; 0.001). The inclusion of all three sites in the determination of the T-score increased the sensitivity to 66% compared with that of 46% when only the proximal femur and lumbar spine were used. This difference between measurements in the upper limb compared with the axial skeleton and lower limb suggests that basing risk assessment and treatment on only the bone mineral density taken at the hip or lumbar spine may misrepresent the extent of osteoporosis in the upper limb and the subsequent risk of fracture at this site. The assessment of osteoporosis must include measurement of the bone mineral density at the distal radius to avoid underestimation of osteoporosis in the upper limb.",M1
19472056,"The balance recovery mechanisms against unexpected forward perturbation.Falls are one of the main concerns of the elderly. Proper postural adjustments to maintain balance involve the activation of appropriate muscles to produce force and to relocate the center of body mass (CoM). In this study, biomechanical aspects of dynamic postural responses against forward perturbations were experimentally determined by simultaneous measurements of joint angles and EMG activations. Thirteen young and healthy volunteers took turns standing on a flat platform, and were directed to move in the forward direction by an AC servo-motor set at two different speeds (0.1 and 0.2 m/s). Joint motions were recorded, and they followed the sequence of ankle dorsiflexion, knee flexion, and then <e>hip</e> flexion during the later acceleration phase (AP) in order to maintain postural balance against forward perturbation. Tibialis anterior for the ankle dorsiflexion and biceps femoris for the knee flexion were activated during the second half of the AP as the primary muscles to recover balance. In addition, gastrocnemius, which was related to ankle plantarflexion, and rectus femoris, which was related to knee extension, were activated to maintain balance. Movements of the center of plantar pressure and ground reaction forces in fast-speed perturbation were significantly larger than those in slow-speed perturbation. As a result, the ankle strategy was used for slow-speed perturbation, but the mixed strategy consisting of both ankles and hip were used for fast-speed perturbation.",M1
19459910,"Botulinum toxin type A injections can be an effective treatment for pain in children with <e>hip</e> spasms and cerebral palsy.AIM: Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injections were used in the treatment of lower-limb spasticity in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Anecdotal evidence suggests a reduction in pain after this treatment in children who had pain localized to a displaced hip joint. We report on our current clinical practice. METHOD: Twenty-six children with non-ambulant quadriplegic CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System level V) were assessed as having significant spasticity and pain at the hip level. Twelve were males and 14 females, with an age range of 2 to 19 years (mean age 11y 6mo, SD 4y 9mo). Ten had functional difficulties secondary to predominant spasticity and 16 had a mix of a high-background peripheral tone with superimposed dystonia. Of the 26 children assessed, 10 had at least one hip which was dislocated and three had at least one hip which was subluxed. As part of their spasticity management programme they received targeted BoNT-A injections to the adductor magnus, medial hamstrings and iliopsoas muscle groups. The Paediatric Pain Profile was used as the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: All had highly significant improvement in their recorded pain profile scores measured at 3 months after treatment (p&lt;0.001). There was equal efficacy in response to treatment in the children with subluxed or dislocated hips. In addition, families commented on improved quality of life for the children across several areas, including sleep, postural management, and activities of daily living. INTERPRETATION: This report demonstrates that targeted BoNT-A injections reduced pain in children with significant spasticity and pain at the hip level. They may also improve quality of life of non-ambulant children with CP and a hip problem.",M1
19542413,"Ischiofemoral impingement syndrome: an entity with <e>hip</e> pain and abnormalities of the quadratus femoris muscle.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the MRI findings of an entity in which patients present with hip pain, abnormal MR signal intensity of the quadratus femoris muscle, and narrowing of the ischiofemoral space. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed MR images of 12 hips in nine patients with hip pain and abnormal MR signal intensity of the quadratus femoris muscle. Using axial MR images, two musculoskeletal radiologists measured the ischiofemoral and quadratus femoris spaces. We also examined changes to muscles and tendons for the presence of edema and tears. Data were compared with 11 hips in 10 control subjects. Statistical analyses determined interobserver variability and differences between groups. RESULTS: Subjects with an abnormal quadratus femoris muscle were all women 30-71 years old (mean age, 53 years) and had significantly narrower ischiofemoral spaces when compared with control subjects (13 +/- 5 vs 23 +/- 8 mm, respectively; p = 0.002). The quadratus femoris space was significantly narrower in affected subjects (7 +/- 3 vs 12 +/- 4 mm; p = 0.002). Abnormalities of the quadratus femoris muscle included edema (100%), partial tear (33%), and fatty infiltration (8%). The hamstring tendons of affected subjects showed evidence of edema (50%) and partial tears (25%). CONCLUSION: Ischiofemoral impingement may represent a cause of hip pain and should be considered in cases with MR signal abnormality of quadratus femoris muscle.",M2
18718837,"Treatment of large ischial ulcers communicating with the <e>hip</e> joint with proximal femoral resection and reconstruction with a combined vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius and rectus femoris musculocutaneous flap.Pressure ulcers which communicate with the hip joint are very difficult to treat. Often, the hip joint is infected with osteomyelitis of the proximal femur resulting in bouts of sepsis and flap failure. These patients require proximal femoral resection and wide debridement in order to eradicate the infection, which in turn results in large and deep cavities. Reconstruction requires either a muscle flap or even a total thigh flap if the defect is very large and the pelvis is involved. In a series of six ischial or ischio-trochanteric pressure sores communicating with the hip joint, following multiple serial debridements, the vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius and rectus femoris muscles were raised as a single musculocutaneous flap ('three muscle flap'), based on the descending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery, and transposed into the defect. All patients were paraplegics and had signs of sepsis during admission. Two patients had prior failed reconstructions within 3 months of admission and the others had not been operated on before. The external skin defect of the ulcers ranged from 7 x 5 cm to 30 x 12 cm. After 12 months follow up there was no recurrence of pressure sores or sepsis. The 'three muscle flap' offers the advantage of providing large bulk to fill deep cavities, while preserving the rest of the thigh. The flap elevation is fast and safe and the vascular pedicle is reliable. This technique is not for simple pressure sores, but should be reserved for large pressure sores complicated with large cavities created after resection of the proximal femur.",M2

We describe a method to quantify, average, and apply data gathered from normal human specimens to create a standard representation of the ilium and ischium. One hundred healthy hemipelves from 50 human skeletons were evaluated. We measured angles and distances between major anatomic landmarks in the pelvis. The data collected were analyzed for variance and averaged to create a normal topographic map. Finally, we examined several commercially available acetabular reconstruction cages to determine the fit to the anatomically determined normal pelvis. These results provide a representation of true acetabular geometry and may serve as the basis for future acetabular reconstruction cage design.",M2
18420061,"[Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis of the obturator rim in seven children]PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Acute osteomyelitis of the rim of the obturator foramen is rarely reported. The clinical presentation is atypical, making diagnosis a difficult task. We report a series of seven cases of osteomyelitis of the obturator rim which illustrate the different features of this localization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The series included seven boys with osteomyelitis involving the obturator foramen. We reviewed the clinical history, the diagnostic approach and management. Complications and anatomic outcome were noted at mean three years follow-up (range one to 10 years). RESULTS: Mean age was 9.5 years (five to 12 years). Bilateral involvement was noted in one boy. Mean time from symptom onset to consultation was five days and mean time from consultation to hospitalization was eight days. No specific clinical presentation could be identified. Fever was not a constant feature. Mean body temperature was 38.6 degrees C and was not greater than 38.5 degrees C in four children. Symptoms were limited to <e>hip</e> pain in five cases and abdominopelvic pain was noted in two. Physical examination failed to trigger exquisite ischial or pubic pain in two patients. The osteomyelitis involved the ischiopubic ramus in four cases, the ischium in two with one bilateral case, and the pubis in one. Certain diagnosis was established as follows: MRI findings plus isolation of the pathogenic agent (n=4) ; the plain x-ray showed a defect in the ischiopubic ramus, MRI showed signs favoring osteomyelitis of the ischiopubic ramus and surgery evacuated a purulent collection (n=1) ; strong uptake of the obturator rim on scintigraphy (n=2). Medical treatment was given in all cases and surgery was performed in six patients. Outcome was noted at three years follow-up, range one to 10 years. All patients recovered normal function. There were no complications. DISCUSSION: Hematogenous osteomyelitis of the pelvis is exceptional (2-11 % of cases of osteomyelitis). Localization in the obturator rim is rare. We discuss the specific diagnostic and therapeutic features of this localization. Despite the controversy concerning the treatment of pelvic osteomyelitis and in particular cases involving the obturator rim, prognosis is generally good. No complications have been described in the literature specifically associated with osteomyelitis of the obturator rim.",M2
18310690,"The proximal origin of the hamstrings and surrounding anatomy encountered during repair. Surgical technique.BACKGROUND: Avulsion of the proximal origin of the hamstrings has become a more frequently recognized athletic injury. Most orthopaedic surgeons rarely operate in this anatomic area. The purpose of the present study was to define the anatomy of the proximal origin of the hamstrings and its relationship to neurovascular and muscular structures encountered during a repair of a complete avulsion. METHODS: Fourteen fresh-frozen <e>hip</e>-to-foot human cadaveric specimens were dissected in the prone position. The proximal origin of the hamstrings and its relationship to the surrounding neurologic and muscular structures were documented and measured with use of digital calipers. RESULTS: Six of the fourteen specimens were from female donors. The average age of the donors at the time of death was 68 +/- 13 years. The average height of the donors was 66 +/- 3.5 in (167 +/- 8.9 cm), and the average weight was 142 +/- 39 lb (64 +/- 17.7 kg). The semitendinosus and biceps femoris have a common tendinous site of origin on the ischium. A number of measurements were obtained. The musculotendinous junctions of the semitendinosus and biceps femoris separated at an average of 9.9 +/- 1.5 cm from the most proximal origin site on the ischium. The average distance from the proximal border of the semitendinosus/biceps femoris origin to the inferior border of the gluteus maximus was 6.3 +/- 1.3 cm. At the lateral border of the ischium, the average distance from the inferior gluteal nerve and artery to the inferior border of the gluteus maximus was 5.0 +/- 0.8 cm. The sciatic nerve was an average of 1.2 +/- 0.2 cm from the most lateral aspect of the ischial tuberosity. The site of origin of the semitendinosus/biceps femoris was oval, with average measurements of 2.7 +/- 0.5 cm from proximal to distal and of 1.8 +/- 0.2 cm from medial to lateral. The site of origin of the semimembranosus was crescent-shaped, with average measurements of 3.1 +/- 0.3 cm from proximal to distal and of 1.1 +/- 0.5 cm from medial to lateral. CONCLUSIONS: The semitendinosus and biceps femoris have a common tendon of origin on the ischium, and the semimembranosus originates just laterally. The proximal origin of the hamstrings has intimate relationships with the inferior gluteal nerve and artery and the sciatic nerve, which may be at risk during surgical dissection and retraction.",M2
16904496,"Diagnosis and management of posttraumatic piriformis syndrome: a case study.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the clinical management of a young male patient with sciatica symptoms that developed after an avulsion of the ischial tuberosity. This is a rare injury, but complications may occur. CLINICAL FEATURE: A 19-year-old patient developed sciatica 6 months after a football injury. The patient described his symptoms as a shooting pain from the buttock to the lateral part of the foot, along the back of his thigh and calf, sometimes accompanied by paresthesia. Physical examination showed restricted <e>hip</e> range of motion and a positive Bonnet's test. X-ray analysis revealed a bony overgrowth of the right ischial tuberosity. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: A treatment plan was designed to decrease the pain level, increase sacroiliac and lumbar joint mobility, and augment muscular extensibility. The patient received 20 treatments over a period of approximately 3 months. Complete recovery was observed 5 months later. CONCLUSION: Although many differential diagnoses were contemplated, it is most likely that changes in muscular tension and gait pattern, resulting from the ischial tuberosity avulsion, contributed to overuse of the piriformis muscle leading to a piriformis syndrome.",M2
16181713,"Center of pressure excursion capability in performance of seated lateral-reaching tasks.BACKGROUND: Seated center of pressure excursion capability can be used for patient evaluation in a clinical setting and in universal design. A quantification of excursion capability across age and anthropometry has not been previously reported, although some research suggests that the ischial tuberosities are the support structure limiting the excursion. METHODS: Thirty-eight neurologically healthy adults ranging in age from 21 to 74 years and including 12 obese persons performed a series of 6 lateral-reaching tasks. Participants sat on a platform such that their feet did not touch the ground, leaving their legs free to provide counterbalancing support. Data recorded from a force plate under the platform allowed calculation of the center of pressure throughout the trial and the maximum excursion for each condition was recorded. FINDINGS: The average excursion capability for the healthy, experimental population was 148 mm or 37% of seated <e>hip</e> breadth. Taller participants had larger maximum excursions, on average, than shorter participants, and older participants had smaller excursions than younger participants. INTERPRETATION: The greater trochanter of the femur-rather than the ischial tuberosities-appears to be the primary support structure limiting center of pressure excursion in lateral, balance-limited reaches without contralateral support. These measures and concepts can be used for design, accommodation, and clinically for patient assessment.",M2

CASE REPORT: Herein is reported a case of hydatidosis of the <e>hip</e> and pelvis with a follow-up of 25 years. The diagnosis was first done in April 1975 following the local excision of a single hydatid cyst from the ischium of a 25-year-old man complaining of increasing pain and swelling of the left thigh. Histology confirmed hydatid disease of the bone. Local excision was repeated four more times for recurrence of the hydatid cysts in the bone or soft tissues. Antiparasitic medical therapy (albendazole 10 mg/kg daily) was attempted in 1991 but suspended after 2 days due to systemic adverse effects (abdominal pain, diarrhea). The patient had a 12-year relapse-free period with complete absence of any symptoms. CONCLUSION: Such a long symptom-free period confirms that it is not possible to consider bone hydatidosis as being completely healed without the confirmation of a long term follow-up.",M2

11107701,"Sex differences in the bony pelvis of the fruit-eating bat, Eidolon helvum.Investigation into the bony pelvis of the fruit-eating bat, Eidolon helvum, revealed differences in the pelvic dimensions. The pubic joint of the female consists of interpubic ligament that increased in length until puberty. In the juvenile male Eidolon the pubic joint consists of ligament. Ossification of the interpubic ligament in the male is not an adult phenomenon but begins at the juvenile stage. In the adult the distance from the ischial tuberosity to the iliac crest, from the ischial tuberosity to the medial end of the pubis, and the outlet anteroposterior diameter of the pelvis, were significantly higher in the male than in the female. This indicates that the <e>hip</e> bone in the male is longer in both the vertical (height) and transverse (width) measurements than in the female. The dimensions of the adult pelvic inlet and outlet transverse diameters were significantly higher in the female than in the male. This indicates that the female pelvic canal is wider than the male and this is a consequence of the female interpubic ligament.",M2

In females that are not prosthetized there are differences in bone mass between the two femurs and the ischium on both sides. In prosthetized patients BMD of the femur and of the ischium on the side operated on is significantly less than on the contralateral one (Student's  t  test: p &lt; 0.001). In patients with stable prostheses, BMD of the femur operated on is greater than that in females with prosthetic stem loosening (Student's  t  test: p &lt; 0.000). Based on a comparison between these two groups we did not observe any other significant differences in BMD among the ROI analyzed. BMD was correlated with the amount of time since surgery only in the ROIs in prosthetized femurs. The study confirms the significant bone resorption of the cortex in prosthetized femurs and documents analogously significant reduction in BMD in the ischium on the side operated on. Finally, it indicates that prosthetic stem loosening may be associated with loss of BMD in the femoral cortex which is significantly greater than that observed, during analogous periods of time in stable implants.",M2

With reconstruction at a near-anatomic hip center, reduction of the arthroplasty is difficult because of the long-standing limb shortening. The major block to reduction is tension of the soft tissues, particularly the hamstrings.

9658523,"Anatomic basis of Tönnis' triple pelvic osteotomy for acetabular dysplasia.Dysplasia of the <e>hip</e> in adults can be treated by a pelvic osteotomy. In order to assess pelvic anatomy in relation to surgical approach and osteotomy sites, 12 cadaver hips were studied. A triple pelvic osteotomy as described by Tönnis [6] through ilium, pubis and ischium was performed, followed by an intrapelvic and anterior and posterior dissection of the hip. At the ischium, the pudendal and inferior gluteal neurovascular bundles are most at risk medially and proximally respectively. Much less in danger is the sciatic n. as it runs 1 to 3 cm lateral to the osteotomy site. At the pubis osteotomy the femoral v. lies close on the bone and is prone to damage. The artery lies further off the bone. The ilium osteotomy starts just proximal to the anterior inferior iliac spine and exits posteriorly at the sciatic notch. Here the sciatic n. and the superior gluteal neurovascular bundle may be damaged. The practical surgical implications of these three osteotomies are discussed, especially with respect to the requirement of meticulous subperiostal dissection and accurate placement of retractors.",M2
9655415,"Limb-salvage in reconstruction of recalcitrant pressure sores using the inferiorly based rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap.Pressure sore closure is frequently a reconstructive challenge. This challenge is particularly evident in cases of multiply recurrent sores. In such settings, there are often opportunities to manage the recurrent wounds either by repeated advancement of previous flaps or by design of alternative ones. However, these interventions are not always feasible, and limb amputation with total thigh flap closure must be considered. A review of operative experience with seven such complex pressure sores in seven patients is presented. Each patient had previously suffered a permanent thoracic-level spinal cord injury. Prior attempts at wound closure were unsuccessful. Despite consideration of all described locoregional flaps, no limb-sparing procedure could be designed satisfactorily. As an alternative to either <e>hip</e> disarticulation and total thigh flap coverage or distant free-tissue transfer, we reconstructed the debrided ulcer beds with inferiorly based rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps. Six of the seven wounds healed primarily, whereas one required repeated debridement and the addition of a gracilis muscle flap to achieve complete closure. Postoperative follow-up has ranged from 6 to 45 months. Each patient has returned to his baseline preoperative activity level with no clinical compromise of abdominal wall function. All wounds have healed. Successful application of the inferiorly based vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap for cases of both recalcitrant ischial and trochanteric pressure sores is demonstrated and its consideration is advocated if no reconstructive options short of extremity amputation and total thigh flap coverage exist for such challenging sores.",M2

7601870,"Load transfer across the pelvic bone.Earlier experimental and finite element studies notwithstanding, the load transfer and stress distribution in the pelvic bone and the acetabulum in normal conditions are not well understood. This hampers the development of orthopaedic reconstruction methods. The present study deals with more precise finite element analyses of the pelvic bone, which are used to investigate its basic load transfer and stress distributions under physiological loading conditions. The analyses show that the major part of the load is transferred through the cortical shell. Although the magnitude of the <e>hip</e> joint force varies considerably, its direction during normal walking remains pointed into the anterior/superior quadrant of the acetabulum. Combined with the fact that the principal areas of support for the pelvic bone are the sacro-iliac joint and the pubic symphysis, this caused the primary areas of load transfer to be found in the superior acetabular rim, the incisura ischiadaca region and, to a lesser extent, the pubic bone. Due to the 'sandwich' behavior of the pelvic bone, stresses in the cortical shell are about 50 times higher than in the underlying trabecular bone (15 to 20 MPa vs 0.3-0.4 MPa at one-legged stance). Highest intraarticular pressures are found to occur during one-legged stance and measured about 9 MPa. During the swing phase, these pressures decrease less than linearly with the magnitude of the hip joint force. Muscle forces have a stabilizing effect on the pelvic load transfer. Analysis without muscle forces show that at some locations stresses are actually higher than when muscle forces are included.",M2
