20389592,"Passive mode-locking of a diode-pumped Nd:YVO(4) laser by intracavity SHG in PPKTP.Experimental results on passive mode-locking of a Nd:YVO(4) laser using intracavity frequency doubling in periodically poled KTP (PPKTP) crystal are reported. Both, negative cascaded chi((2)) lensing and frequency doubling nonlinear mirror (FDNLM) are exploited for the laser mode-locking. The FDNLM based on intensity dependent reflection in the laser cavity ensures self-starting and self-sustaining mode-locking while the cascaded chi((2)) <e>lens</e> process contributes to substantial pulse shortening. This hybrid technique enables generation of stable trains of pulses at high-average output power with several picoseconds pulse width. The pulse repetition rate of the laser is 117 MHz with average output power ranging from 0.5 to 3.1 W and pulse duration from 2.9 to 5.2 ps.",M1

These distributions contain information about the three-dimensional electromagnetic field that results from the interaction of a tightly focused field and a sub-resolution scatterer. Experimental evidence proving that the system allows for high polarization-dependent sensitivity to sub-resolution displacements of a sub-resolution scatterer is provided together with the corresponding numerical results.",M1
20389562,"Silver superlens using antisymmetric surface plasmon modes.Silver lenses having super-resolution are analyzed in terms of antisymmetric modes of surface plasmon which have the ability to amplify evanescent waves in UV region. Antisymmetric surface plasmon modes excited by subwavelength grating enhances the resolution and contrast of silver superlens. By using a 20 nm-thick silver superlens, the half-pitch resolution of approximately lambda(0)/8 can be achieved with good contrast at a free space wavelength of 435 nm. The resolution of silver superlens can also be improved using shorter illumination wavelength. We show that the thinner the <e>lens</e>, the better the imaging ability of the silver superlens due to the excitation of antisymmetric surface plasmon modes of higher propagation wave vectors. The thickness of lens is varied from 20 to 40 nm in a three layer system, SiO(2)-Ag-SiO(2). Obtained results illustrate that practical application for patterning periodic structures with good contrast and penetration depth can be achieved by using antisymmetric surface plasmon modes.",M1
20389373,"Gabor-based fusion technique for Optical Coherence Microscopy.We recently reported on an Optical Coherence Microscopy technique, whose innovation intrinsically builds on a recently reported - 2 microm invariant lateral resolution by design throughout a 2 mm cubic full-field of view - liquid-<e>lens</e>-based dynamic focusing optical probe [Murali et al., Optics Letters 34, 145-147, 2009]. We shall report in this paper on the image acquisition enabled by this optical probe when combined with an automatic data fusion method developed and described here to produce an in-focus high resolution image throughout the imaging depth of the sample. An African frog tadpole (Xenopus laevis) was imaged with the novel probe and the Gabor-based fusion technique, demonstrating subcellular resolution in a 0.5 mm (lateral) x 0.5 mm (axial) without the need, for the first time, for x-y translation stages, depth scanning, high-cost adaptive optics, or manual intervention. In vivo images of human skin are also presented.",M1
20389353,"Experimental investigation of superfocusing of plasmonic <e>lens</e> with chirped circular nanoslits.A plasmonic lens with metallic chirped circular nanoslits corrugated on Au film supported on quartz substrate for the purpose of superfocusing was put forth and fabricated by means of focused ion beam direct milling technique. Topography of the lens was imaged using an atomic force microscope. After that a near-field scanning optical microscope was employed for optical characterization of focusing performance of the lens. Our experimental results verify the focusing performance and further demonstrate that they are in agreement with the theoretical calculation results. Focusing performance is significantly improved in comparison to that of the non-chirped lens. The lenses are possible to be used for the applications of bioimaging, detection, and inspection in submicron scale resolution.",M1
20368461,"Generation and control of sound bullets with a nonlinear acoustic <e>lens</e>.Acoustic lenses are employed in a variety of applications, from biomedical imaging and surgery to defense systems and damage detection in materials. Focused acoustic signals, for example, enable ultrasonic transducers to image the interior of the human body. Currently however the performance of acoustic devices is limited by their linear operational envelope, which implies relatively inaccurate focusing and low focal power. Here we show a dramatic focusing effect and the generation of compact acoustic pulses (sound bullets) in solid and fluid media, with energies orders of magnitude greater than previously achievable. This focusing is made possible by a tunable, nonlinear acoustic lens, which consists of ordered arrays of granular chains. The amplitude, size, and location of the sound bullets can be controlled by varying the static precompression of the chains. Theory and numerical simulations demonstrate the focusing effect, and photoelasticity experiments corroborate it. Our nonlinear lens permits a qualitatively new way of generating high-energy acoustic pulses, which may improve imaging capabilities through increased accuracy and signal-to-noise ratios and may lead to more effective nonintrusive scalpels, for example, for cancer treatment.",M1
20356016,"Copolymer-based progressive addition <e>lens</e> with graded index designed for astigmatism and distortion correction.In this research, we propose to reduce astigmatism and distortion in a progressive addition lens (PAL) by employing a polymer-based graded-index (GRIN) material. We adopted the diffusion copolymerization method for the GRIN-PAL fabrication. The GRIN material was prepared by partial diffusion of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate (3FMA) monomers into the cross-linked benzyl methacrylate polymer gel. GRIN-PAL was prepared by polymerization of the GRIN material in a mold of commercially available PAL. As a result, methods to control Deltan, the diffusion length, and the order of the GRIN profile in polymeric GRIN materials were demonstrated. In a combination of the PBzMA gel and the MMA/3FMA diffusion monomer, 50/50 in volume provides the highest Deltan. The diffusion period mainly affects the diffusion length. These two parameters consequently determine the order of the GRIN profile and the focusing power that the GRIN provides. The difference in the ease of diffusion caused by the difference in the cross-linking density provides a method for positional control of the GRIN profile. Furthermore, GRIN-PAL using a polymeric material was successfully fabricated. Improvement in astigmatism and distortion was demonstrated using GRIN. Therefore, the GRIN material is suggested to be applicable for the further modification of the PAL with low astigmatism and distortion.",M1
20224140,"Representation-independent in-place magnification with sigma lenses.Focus+context interaction techniques based on the metaphor of lenses are used to navigate and interact with objects in large information spaces. They provide in-place magnification of a region of the display without requiring users to zoom into the representation and consequently lose context. In order to avoid occlusion of its immediate surroundings, the magnified region is often integrated in the context using smooth transitions based on spatial distortion. Such lenses have been developed for various types of representations using techniques often tightly coupled with the underlying graphics framework. We describe a representation-independent solution that can be implemented with minimal effort in different graphics frameworks, ranging from 3D graphics to rich multiscale 2D graphics combining text, bitmaps, and vector graphics. Our solution is not limited to spatial distortion and provides a unified model that makes it possible to define new focus+context interaction techniques based on lenses whose transition is defined by a combination of dynamic displacement and compositing functions. We present the results of a series of user evaluations that show that one such new <e>lens</e>, the speed-coupled blending lens, significantly outperforms all others.",M1
20224135,"Real-time rendering method and performance evaluation of composable 3D lenses for interactive VR.We present and evaluate a new approach for real-time rendering of composable 3D lenses for polygonal scenes. Such lenses, usually called  volumetric lenses,  are an extension of 2D Magic Lenses to 3D volumes in which effects are applied to scene elements. Although the composition of 2D lenses is well known, 3D composition was long considered infeasible due to both geometric and semantic complexity. Nonetheless, for a scene with multiple interactive 3D lenses, the problem of intersecting lenses must be considered. Intersecting 3D lenses in meaningful ways supports new interfaces such as hierarchical 3D windows, 3D lenses for managing and composing visualization options, or interactive shader development by direct manipulation of lenses providing component effects. Our 3D volumetric <e>lens</e> approach differs from other approaches and is one of the first to address efficient composition of multiple lenses. It is well-suited to head-tracked VR environments because it requires no view-dependent generation of major data structures, allowing caching and reuse of full or partial results. A Composite Shader Factory module composes shader programs for rendering composite visual styles and geometry of intersection regions. Geometry is handled by Boolean combinations of region tests in fragment shaders, which allows both convex and nonconvex CSG volumes for lens shape. Efficiency is further addressed by a Region Analyzer module and by broad-phase culling. Finally, we consider the handling of order effects for composed 3D lenses.",M1
20188934,"Comparison of optoacoustic and photothermal-<e>lens</e> determination of lipopolysaccharides.As a primary aim, several approaches to photothermal (thermal-lens) and optoacoustic determination of exogenous pyrogens (lipopolysaccharides) based on photometric procedures for their determination at the microgram level and below are compared. The limits of detection of lipopolysaccharides by thermal-lens spectrometry and optoacoustic spectroscopy are at a level of 2-100 ng/mL, and the conditions of optoacoustic and photothermal procedures are the same. Optoacoustic spectroscopy is advantageous in determining suspensions, while thermal lensing is superior in determining lipopolysaccharides from homogenous aqueous solutions. As a secondary aim, photometric procedures for lipopolysaccharides by the formation of their ion pairs with several dyes and by the reaction of 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid as a part of a lipopolysaccharide molecule with thiobarbituric acid are optimized. In the case of the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid reaction, the sampling stage time is decreased twofold, and the possibility of substitution of the toxic metaarsenite for sulfite with better sensitivity is shown.",M1

20173861,"Design of compact freeform <e>lens</e> for application specific Light-Emitting Diode packaging.Application specific LED packaging (ASLP) is an emerging technology for high performance LED lighting. We introduced a practical design method of compact freeform lens for extended sources used in ASLP. A new ASLP for road lighting was successfully obtained by integrating a polycarbonate compact freeform lens of small form factor with traditional LED packaging. Optical performance of the ASLP was investigated by both numerical simulation based on Monte Carlo ray tracing method and experiments. Results demonstrated that, comparing with traditional LED module integrated with secondary optics, the ASLP had advantages of much smaller size in volume (approximately 1/8), higher system lumen efficiency (approximately 8.1%), lower cost and more convenience for customers to design and assembly, enabling possible much wider applications of LED for general road lighting. Tolerance analyses were also conducted. Installation errors of horizontal and vertical deviations had more effects on the shape and uniformity of radiation pattern compared with rotational deviation. The tolerances of horizontal, vertical and rotational deviations of this lens were 0.11 mm, 0.14 mm and 2.4 degrees respectively, which were acceptable in engineering.",M1

Particles in this size range have significant influence on the heterogeneous chemistry in the atmosphere and affect human health. Interfacing an aerodynamic lens to an ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectrometer permits measurement of the surface chemical composition of unsupported aerosol particles in real time.

20052066,"Dual-axis beam correction for an array of single-mode diode laser emitters using a laser-written custom phase-plate.A single optical component for a diode laser bar combines fast-axis smile and <e>lens</e> error correction with slow-axis collimation. Produced by laser-machining/polishing, it provides 0.9 mm focal length, 200 microm pitch slow-axis collimation on the same surface that corrects fast-axis errors. Custom fabrication enables fill-factor optimization for the 49 single-mode beams and gives parallel collimation with rms pointing errors of 3% and 6% of the far-field divergence for the fast- and slow-axis array respectively. Sub-micron pitch mismatch between the slow-axis lens and emitter arrays, and beam pointing changes by thermal expansion of the laser bar are detected.",M1

The thermal lens in the Ng-cut Nd: KGW was found to be weakly astigmatic with a positive refractive power for both the Nm- and Np-directions. For Np -cut Nd:KGW, strong astigmatism was observed and the refractive powers in the Ng- and Nm-directions had opposing signs. The degree of astigmatism was found to be considerably weaker for the Ng-cut Nd:KGW in comparison with the Np-cut one: 0.35 dptr/(W/cm2) and 2.85 dptr/(W/cm2), respectively. The ratio of the thermal lens refractive powers in the planes parallel and perpendicular to the laser emission polarisation were measured as +1.4 and -0.425 for Ng- and Np-cut Nd:KGW respectively.",M1
20052052,"LED beam shaping <e>lens</e> based on the near-field illumination.This paper presents a novel method in near-field beam shaping based on the precise optical modeling of a gallium nitride light-emitting diode (GaN LED). A Monte Carlo ray tracing simulation has been utilized to calculate the spatial photon distribution near the LED's top. By analyzing the ray data in near-field, the miniaturized lens profile is created and machined with aspherical surfaces and total internal reflection (TIR) Fresnel facets. The prototype lens reduce the viewing angle of the LED from 150 degrees to 17.5 degrees at full width half maximum (FWHM) while increasing the peak luminous intensity 10 times.

20037592,"Adaptive optics via pupil segmentation for high-resolution imaging in biological tissues.Biological specimens are rife with optical inhomogeneities that seriously degrade imaging performance under all but the most ideal conditions. Measuring and then correcting for these inhomogeneities is the province of adaptive optics. Here we introduce an approach to adaptive optics in microscopy wherein the rear pupil of an objective <e>lens</e> is segmented into subregions, and light is directed individually to each subregion to measure, by image shift, the deflection faced by each group of rays as they emerge from the objective and travel through the specimen toward the focus. Applying our method to two-photon microscopy, we could recover near-diffraction-limited performance from a variety of biological and nonbiological samples exhibiting aberrations large or small and smoothly varying or abruptly changing. In particular, results from fixed mouse cortical slices illustrate our ability to improve signal and resolution to depths of 400 microm.",M1
20023643,"Colloidal lenses allow high-temperature single-molecule imaging and improve fluorophore photostability.Although single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy was first demonstrated at near-absolute zero temperatures (1.8 K), the field has since advanced to include room-temperature observations, largely owing to the use of objective lenses with high numerical aperture, brighter fluorophores and more sensitive detectors. This has opened the door for many chemical and biological systems to be studied at native temperatures at the single-molecule level both in vitro and in vivo. However, it is difficult to study systems and phenomena at temperatures above 37 degrees C, because the index-matching fluids used with high-numerical-aperture objective lenses can conduct heat from the sample to the <e>lens</e>, and sustained exposure to high temperatures can cause the lens to fail. Here, we report that TiO(2) colloids with diameters of 2 microm and a high refractive index can act as lenses that are capable of single-molecule imaging at 70 degrees C when placed in immediate proximity to an emitting molecule. The optical system is completed by a low-numerical-aperture optic that can have a long working distance and an air interface, which allows the sample to be independently heated. Colloidal lenses were used for parallel imaging of surface-immobilized single fluorophores and for real-time single-molecule measurements of mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes at 70 degrees C. Fluorophores in close proximity to TiO(2) also showed a 40% increase in photostability due to a reduction of the excited-state lifetime.",M1
20011011,"Optical coherence tomography for quantitative surface topography.We address the measurement and correction of fan distortion in optical coherence tomography (OCT). This effect arises from the scanning system configuration and prevents one, in general, from obtaining quantitative topographic data from OCT. Computer simulations allowed us to quantify the effect and evaluate its dependence on the scanning mirror separation and design of the collimating <e>lens</e>, as well as to estimate the optimal axial position of that lens to minimize the fan distortion. We also developed a numerical algorithm based on 3-D ray propagation for the correction of the residual fan distortion. The effect was studied experimentally using a custom developed time-domain OCT in a Michelson configuration provided with a confocal channel, and the accuracy of the fan distortion correction algorithm tested on samples of known dimensions (flat surfaces and spherical lenses). With a proper calibration of the system with use of an onfocal channel, this algorithm makes it possible for time-domain OCT devices to be used as topographers.",M1

19997321,"Dual-operation-mode liquid crystal <e>lens</e>.We demonstrate a dual-operation-mode liquid crystal (LC) lens, which is fabricated with the silica nanoparticle-doped (SND) hybrid-aligned nematic (HAN) LC cell. With AC voltage, the cell behaves as a conventional LC lens. The response time of the SND HAN LC lens is faster than that of the conventional LC lens, which is fabricated using the pristine HAN LC cell. This is because that the doped silica nanoparticles may decrease the dielectric relaxation time constant of the cell. The addition of the silica nanoparticles also increases the viscosity of the LC host, suppresses the backflow motion of the LCs and then decreases the response time of the SND LC lens. With DC voltage, the electrophoretic motion of the doped silica nanoparticles and the agglomerate silica networks on the substrate surface cause the SND HAN LC cell to function as a bistable LC lens.",M1
19997229,"Laser differential confocal ultra-long focal length measurement.A new laser differential confocal focal-length measurement method is proposed for the measurement of an ultra-long focal-length. The approach proposed uses the property of an axial intensity curve that the absolute zero precisely corresponds to the focus of the objective in a differential confocal focusing system (DCFS) to measure the variation in position of DCFS focus with and without a measured ultra-long focal-length <e>lens</e> (UFL), uses the distance between the two focuses to obtain the UFL focal-length, and thereby achieving the precise measurement of ultra-long focal-length. The method has a high focusing precision, a strong anti-interference capability and a short measurement light-path.

19967631,"Oolong tea is useful for <e>lens</e> cleansing in transnasal small-caliber esophagogastroduodenoscopy.BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Unsedated transnasal small-caliber esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been used to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract with proven feasibility and tolerability. However, a limitation of transnasal EGD is the poor lens-cleansing function of the scope due to the small-caliber water-jet nozzle. Therefore, this trial was designed to evaluate the cleansing effect of oolong tea for transnasal small-caliber EGD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Oolong tea (O), barley tea (B), and distilled water (W) were prepared as washing solutions for endoscopic lenses. Study I: after the lenses were soiled by lard oil, they were washed with one of the three washing solutions, and the image quality of photographs was judged. Study II: 982 patients who were due to undergo transnasal EGD were enrolled and randomly assigned to the O-, B-, or W-groups. The level of lens cleansing, the overall time required for endoscopy, and the volume of washing solution used were measured. RESULTS: Study I: the image quality of photographs taken with lenses washed with oolong tea was significantly superior to that associated with other solutions. Study II: the level of lens cleansing in the O-group was significantly superior to that of the B- and W-groups ( P &lt; 0.001). The volume of solution used for lens cleansing in the O-group was significantly smaller than that in the W-group ( P &lt; 0.05). Endoscopic examination times in the O-group were shorter than those in the B- and W-groups ( P &lt; 0.05).

19965017,"Bio-inspired fluidic <e>lens</e> surgical camera for MIS.We report a new type of surgical camera that will greatly improve minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The key enabling technology for this camera is a unique type of lens-bio-inspired fluidic lens, which is a bio-mimetic lens that can change its curvature, just like the way human crystalline lens can accommodate. Because of its curvature changing capability, it is now possible to design a new regime of optical systems where auto-focusing and optical zoom can be performed without moving the lens positions, as is done in typical cameras. Hence, miniaturized imaging system with high functionality can be achieved with such technology. MIS is a surgical technique where small incisions are made on the abdominal wall as opposed to a large cut in open surgery. This type of surgery ensures faster patient recovery. The key tool for MIS is its surgical camera, or laparoscope. Traditional laparoscope is long and rigid and limits the field of view. To further advance MIS technology, we utilized bio-inspired fluidic lens to design a highly versatile imager that is small, can change its field of view or zoom optically, works in low light conditions, and varies the viewing angles. The surgical camera prototype is small (total track&lt;17 mm), possesses 3X optical zoom, operates with light emitting diode (LED) lighting, among many other unique features.",M1
19925323,"Metamaterial <e>lens</e> applicator for microwave hyperthermia of breast cancer.Artificial left-handed metamaterial (LHM) provides a new perspective for microwave hyperthermia. Four flat LHM slab lenses can be used to form a focus-flexible applicator for breast tumour hyperthermia. By adjusting microwave sources behind the four flat LHM lenses, microwaves emitted from the sources can be focused tightly at different points in the breast tissue so that necessary heating depth in breast tissue can be achieved. Numerical simulations with a two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method indicate that hyperthermia with the proposed four-lens applicator of moderate LHM losses could be effective in achieving desired power deposition in a heterogeneous breast model.

19907580,"Elimination of flux loss by optimizing the groove angle in modified Fresnel <e>lens</e> to increase illuminance uniformity, color uniformity and flux efficiency in LED illumination.A Fresnel lens is an optical component that can be used to create systems more compact, cost-effective, and lightweight than those using conventional continuous surface optics. However, Fresnel lenses can usually cause a loss of flux efficiency and non-uniform distribution of illuminance due to secondary refraction by surface discontinuities, especially along the groove facet. We therefore proposed to modify a groove angle in the Fresnel lens and analyzed interrelation between the groove angle and multiple optical performances, such as flux efficiency and the uniformity of illuminance and color. The groove angle was optimized to maximize the uniformity and efficiency in the target viewing angle considering various weights of merit functions. Specifically, in our study, when the uniformity of illuminance had a little more weight than the flux efficiency (ratio of 0.6:0.4), final optimum groove angles of 24.7 degrees , 29.4 degrees , and 31.3 degrees were obtained at target viewing angles of 20 degrees , 30 degrees , and 40 degrees , respectively.

19907508,"Realization of optical OFDM using time lenses and its comparison with optical OFDM using FFT.An optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme with Fourier transform in optical domain using time lenses both at the transmitter and at the receiver is analyzed.

In this letter, we report the experimental confirmation of the focusing properties and field enhancement effect of plasmonic lens made of multiple concentric annular rings using a collection mode near field scanning optical microscope. Surface plasmons excited at all azimuthal directions propagate toward the geometric center and constructively interfere at the focus to create a strongly enhanced evanescent optical  needle  field that is substantially polarized vertically to the plasmonic lens surface.

19786929,"Accommodative training to reduce nearwork-induced transient myopia.PURPOSE: To assess changes in the nearwork-induced transient myopia parameters of initial magnitude and its decay duration, as well as accuracy of the near accommodative steady-state response and clinically based accommodative facility, after 6 weeks of home-based accommodative training in asymptomatic myopes. METHODS: Ten young adult, progressing myopes participated in the study. The experimental paradigm consisted of a baseline session and two follow-up sessions at the end of the third and sixth weeks of training. At the first session, baseline refractive state and selected accommodative functions were assessed. Measurements were repeated at the two follow-up sessions. Home-based vision training included accommodative flippers (+/-2 D) at near, Hart chart at distance (6 m) and near (40 cm), and prism flipper (6 pd) training at near (40 cm), for a total of 20 minutes a day performed 5 days a week for 6 weeks. RESULTS: Several dynamic accommodative response functions improved significantly with training. <e>Lens</e> flipper rate increased significantly from 11 to 16 cpm in the OD (p = 0.04), 11 to 19 cpm in the OS (p = 0.03), and 8 to 11 cpm in the OU (p = 0.03). Hart chart rate increased significantly from 22 to 33 cpm in the OD (p = 0.01) and from 22 to 31 cpm in the OS (p = 0.02). There was a significant negative correlation between lens flipper rate and nearwork-induced transient myopia decay duration after training (p = 0.02) with binocular viewing. CONCLUSIONS: Training of the accommodative system in these progressing myopes resulted in improved dynamics in both laboratory and clinical measures. This is consistent with earlier reports in the literature of improvement in symptomatic myopic subjects.",M1
19724574,"The Gabor superlens as an alternative wafer-level camera approach inspired by superposition compound eyes of nocturnal insects.We present the microoptical adaption of the natural superposition compound eye, which is termed  Gabor superlens .

By numerical ray tracing optimization, and by adding diaphragm layers and a field <e>lens</e> array, the optical performance of the Gabor superlens is potentially comparable to miniaturized conventional lens modules, such as currently integrated in mobile phones. However, in contrast to those, the Gabor superlens is fabricated using a standard microlens array technology with low sag heights and small diameter microlenses.

19654841,"Tunable-focus liquid <e>lens</e> system controlled by antagonistic winding-type SMA actuator.A new tunable-focus liquid lens system is proposed that consists of a liquid-filled PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) membrane, special liquid injection mechanism based on a cam structure, antagonistic winding-type SMA(shape memory alloys) actuator for changing the surface curvature of the membrane, and liquid injection control system, including a digital signal processing board and actuator driver board. The focal length of the liquid lens is adjusted by changing the radius of the curvature of the liquid lens through redistributing the liquid using an injection mechanism. In the case of liquid lens systems using conventional injection mechanisms, the nonlinear relationship between the focal length change and the actuator displacement makes it difficult to control the focal length of the lens system, as there is only a narrow control range for adjusting the focal length over a wide range. In addition, miniaturization of the lens system is difficult due to the requirement of bulky and heavy actuators, such as an electrical motor and pump[7]. Thus, a relatively light and small SMA actuator is proposed for a compact lens system. This paper then provides a detailed description of the proposed tunable-focus liquid lens system, and an experimental system is also implemented. Finally, the focusing performance of the proposed liquid lens system is analyzed, and its usefulness and effectiveness verified through a series of experiments.",M1

We found that the high aspect ratio structure was higher after exposure as the inner and outer diameter had increased. In addition, we used an oblique incidence on the negative resist metallic ring structure to produce an inclined micro-structure. Different exposure results were obtained with the two different metal thicknesses.

19582082,"Improvement of matrix condition of Hybrid, space variant optics by the means of parallel optics design.The problem of image restoration of space variant blur is common and important. One of the most useful descriptions of this problem is in its algebraic form I=H*O, where O is the object represented as a column vector, I is the blur image represented as a column vector and H is the PSF matrix that represents the optical system. When inverting the problem to restore the geometric object from the blurred image and the known system matrix, restoration is limited in speed and quality by the system condition. Current optical design methods focus on image quality, therefore if additional image processing is needed the matrix condition is taken  as is . In this paper we would like to present a new optical approach which aims to improve the system condition by proper optical design. In this new method we use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to define the weak parts of the matrix condition. We design a second optical system based on those weak SVD parts and then we add the second system parallel to the first one. The original and second systems together work as an improved parallel optics system. Following that, we present a method for designing such a  parallel filter  for systems with a spread SVD pattern. Finally we present a study case in which by using our new method we improve a space variant image system with an initial condition number of 8.76e4, down to a condition number of 2.29e3. We use matrix inversion to simulate image restoration. Results show that the new parallel optics immunity to Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is much better then that of the original simple <e>lens</e>.

The PAL approximates a Fresnel lens and allows for high efficiency compared to filters based on ordinary refractive lenses, however at the cost of a lower energy resolution. Geometrical optics was found to provide a good approximation for the performance of a flawless lens, but a field-propagation model was used for quantitative predictions. The model predicted a 0.29 E/E energy resolution and an intensity gain of 6.5 for a silicon PAL at 23.5 keV. Measurements with an x-ray tube showed good agreement with the model in energy resolution and peak energy, but a blurred focal line contributed to a 29% gain reduction.

The LC lens with proposed electrodes improves the central intensity of electric field which leads to better focusing quality. The overall thickness of the LC lens can be as thin as 1.2 mm and the shortest focal length of the 4 mm-aperture lens occurs at 20 cm under an applied voltage of 30 V at 1 KHz. The inner ring electrode requires only 40% of applied voltage of the external hole electrode.

The focusing of light was achieved through the gradient refractive index (GRIN) within the liquid medium, rather than via curved refractive lens surfaces. The diffusion of solute (CaCl(2)) between side-by-side co-injected microfluidic laminar flows was utilized to establish a hyperbolic secant (HS) refractive index profile to focus light. Tailoring the refractive index profile by adjusting the flow conditions enables not only tuning of the focal distance (translation mode), but also shifting of the output light direction (swing mode), a second degree of freedom that to our knowledge has yet to be accomplished for in-plane tunable microlenses.

19417707,"Minus <e>lens</e> stimulated accommodative lag as a function of age.PURPOSE: Previous studies in children report reduced accommodative responses with minus lens-stimulated demands compared with proximal demands. This study seeks to identify age-related changes in accommodative lag with minus lens-stimulated demands in subjects from preschoolers to adults. METHODS: Accommodative responses were measured in 101 subjects (3 to 40 years) with at least 10 subjects in each 5-year age bin. Subjects monocularly viewed a high-contrast target at 33.3 cm on the near-point rod of the Grand Seiko autorefractor. Measurements of refraction were taken as the subject viewed the target. Accommodative lag was defined as the difference between demand and measured response. Four additional demands were tested by introducing minus lenses [-1 to -4 diopter (D)] in the spectacle plane of the viewing eye. Maximum accommodative amplitudes were determined by presenting additional lenses until the measured response plateaued or peaked. Accommodative demands and responses were adjusted to the corneal plane. RESULTS.: Accommodative lag showed a significant linear decrease with age for subjects 3 to 20 years for each of the first four demands (3 D, 3.92 D, 4.80 D, 5.67 D, p &lt;or= 0.013) and approached significance for the largest demand (6.52 D, p = 0.053). For the entire group, accommodative lag increased with increasing stimulus demand, with the largest increase occurring for subjects aged 30 to 40 years as stimulus demands approached the subjects' maximum amplitude. For subjects aged 3 to 20 years, multilevel modeling analysis revealed a significant relationship between age and lag (p &lt; 0.0001) and a significant relationship between maximum amplitude and the increase in lag per unit increase in stimulus demand (p = 0.0032). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the accuracy of accommodation to minus lens-stimulated accommodation improves throughout the school years and that the degree to which lag increases with increasing demand is related to maximum accommodative amplitude rather than age.",M1
19412212,"Possibility of corrector plate tuning of x-ray focusing.Schemes for focusing a hard x-ray beam to a small spot are described. The theoretical minimum spot size, assuming perfect mirror shape, is shown to be 4 nm FWHM, independent of x-ray wavelength. This is less than the 10 nm previously said to be the minimum achievable diffraction-limited x-ray spot size. While providing the penetrating power only possible with x rays, this approaches the resolution needed to image individual atoms or atomic layers. However, the perfect mirror assumption is physically unrealistic. This paper discusses the compensation of mirror shape errors by a corrector plate and shows that the tolerances for corrector plate shape are far looser than are tolerances for mirror shape. The full eventual success of achieving theoretical minimum resolution will require mirror shape precision considerably better than has been achieved at this time, though far looser than would be required for simpleminded paraboloidal focusing. Two variants of the scheme, subject to the same mathematical treatment, are described. (i) The  corrector plate  name is copied from the similarly functioning element of the same name in a Schmidt camera. The focusing is achieved using glancing, yet coherent, reflection from a high-Z paraboloidal mirror. The strategy is to obtain dominant focusing from reflection and to compensate with weak refractive focusing. The reflective focusing is strong and achromatic but insufficiently accurate. The refractive focusing is weak and chromatic but highly accurate. The corrector plate improves resolution the way eyeglasses help a person to see. It can, for example, be  fitted  the same trial-and-error way an optometrist establishes a prescription for glasses. Dimensional tolerances for the compensator are far looser than would be needed for a mirror to achieve the same resolution. Unlike compound refractive lenses, attenuation will be small, at least for wavelengths longer than 1 A, because the compensation layer is thin. (ii) For this variant, the corrector plate is a washer-shaped refractive or Fresnel <e>lens</e>, and the mirror is (theoretically) a perfect cone. All focusing is provided by the lens. Even though the cone provides no focusing, it improves the resolution by increasing the numerical aperture of the device. Compared to a paraboloidal shape, it is assumed that the conical shape can be more accurately fabricated. Of the two variants, only the first variant is, in principle, capable of achieving the theoretical minimum resolution.

However, both results will remain well above the theoretical minimum until fabrication techniques have been developed that provide greater precision than is possible at this time.",M1
19406717,"Low acoustic attenuation silicone rubber <e>lens</e> for medical ultrasonic array probe.Effects of heavy density (rho = 9.2 x 10(3) kg/m(3)) Yb(2)O(3) fine dopant (16 nm in diameter) on the acoustic properties of a high-temperature-vulcanization (HTV) silicone rubber have been investigated, to develop a new acoustic lens material with a low acoustic attenuation (alpha) for the medical array probe application. The HTV silicone rubber has advantages in that it shows a lower alpha than that of a room-temperature-vulcanization (RTV) silicone rubber and it can be mixed by applying shear stress, using roll-milling equipment. Roll-milling time dependence of the HTV silicone rubber indicates that the alpha is closely affected by the dispersion of nanopowders in the rubber matrix. The 8 vol% Yb(2)O(3)-doped HTV silicone rubber mixed for 30 min showed the lowest alpha of 0.73 dB/mm MHz with an acoustic impedance [AI = sound speed (c) x density (rho)] of 1.43 x 10(6) kg/m(2)s at 37 degrees C. Moreover, simulation results reveal that a 5 MHz linear probe using the HTV silicone rubber doped with Yb(2)O(3) powder showed relative sensitivity around 2.6 to 3.0 dB higher than a probe using RTV silicone rubber doped with Yb(2)O(3) powder or SiO2-doped conventional silicone rubber for the ultrasonic medical application.",M1
19405757,"Tangential resolution improvement in thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography using a negative acoustic <e>lens</e>.We developed a novel concept of using a negative acoustic lens to increase the acceptance angle of an unfocused large-area ultrasonic transducer (detector), leading to more than twofold improvement of the tangential resolution in both thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography. In both thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography, for a given transducer bandwidth, the aperture size of the detector affects the tangential resolution greatly when the object of interest is near the detector surface. We were able to overcome such tangential resolution deterioration by attaching an acoustic concave lens, made of acrylic in front of the flat detector surface. We then quantified the tangential resolution improvement using phantom images. We also showed that the use of the negative lens preserves the shape of an object after the image is reconstructed.",M1

19370234,"Modelling and optimization of micro optofluidic lenses.This paper reports the modelling and experimental results of a liquid-core liquid-cladding optofluidic <e>lens</e>. The lens is based on three laminar streams in a circular chamber. The stream lines and the curvature of the interface can be predicted accurately using the theory of two-dimensional dipole flow in a circularly bounded domain. The model establishes basic relations between the flow rate ratio of the core/cladding streams and the radius of curvature and consequently the focal length of the lens. Compared to a rectangular chamber, this new circular design allows the formation of a liquid-core liquid-cladding lens with perfect curvatures. The circular design allows tuning a perfect curvature ranging from the chamber radius itself to infinity. The test device with a circular lens chamber with 1 mm diameter and 50 microm height was fabricated in PDMS. The lens shape as well as the stream lines were characterized using fluorescent dye and tracing particles. Experimental results agree well with the analytical results predicted by the model.",M1

19365468,"Chaotic behavior in an algorithm to escape from poor local minima in <e>lens</e> design.In lens design, damped least-squares methods are typically used to find the nearest local minimum to a starting configuration in the merit function landscape. In this paper, we explore the use of such a method for a purpose that goes beyond local optimization. The merit function barrier, which separates an unsatisfactory solution from a neighboring one that is better, can be overcome by using low damping and by allowing the merit function to temporarily increase. However, such an algorithm displays chaos, chaotic transients and other types of complex behavior. A successful escape of the iteration trajectory from a poor local minimum to a better one is associated with a crisis phenomenon that transforms a chaotic attractor into a chaotic saddle. The present analysis also enables a better understanding of peculiarities encountered with damped least-squares algorithms in conventional local optimization tasks.",M1

The compound lens consisted of a pair of aspherical lenses and exhibited reduced chromatic aberration compared with gradient-index lenses, thus increasing the TPF/SHG collection efficiency. The introduction of a short MMF collector at the distal end of the double-clad fiber of the endomicroscope further mitigated the adverse influence of chromatic aberration of the lens and enhanced the TPF/SHG collection efficiency.

Surface roughness and smooth transition between two discrete sub-surfaces are two of the most common manufacturing defects existing in discontinuous freeform lenses. The effects of these two manufacturing defects on the optical performance of two discontinuous freeform lenses were investigated by comparing the experimental results with the numerical simulation results based on Monte Carlo ray trace method. The results demonstrated that manufacturing defects induced surface roughness had small effect on the light output efficiency and the shape of light pattern of the PMMA lens but significantly affected the uniformity of light pattern, which declined from 0.644 to 0.313. The smooth transition surfaces with deviation angle more than 60 degrees existing in the BK7 glass lens, not only reduced the uniformity of light pattern, but also reduced the light output efficiency from 96.9% to 91.0% and heavily deformed the shape of the light pattern. Comparing with the surface roughness, the smooth transition surface had a much more adverse effect on the optical performance of discontinuous freeform lenses.

19258914,"Approximating <e>lens</e> power.PURPOSE: To provide a scalar measure of refractive error, based on geometric lens power through principal, orthogonal and oblique meridians, that is not limited to the paraxial and sag height approximations. METHODS: A function is derived to model sections through the principal meridian of a lens, followed by rotation of the section through orthogonal and oblique meridians. Average focal length is determined using the definition for the average of a function. RESULTS: Average univariate power in the principal meridian (including spherical aberration), can be computed from the average of a function over the angle of incidence as determined by the parameters of the given lens, or adequately computed from an integrated series function. Average power through orthogonal and oblique meridians, can be similarly determined using the derived formulae. CONCLUSIONS: The widely used computation for measuring refractive error, the spherical equivalent, introduces non-constant approximations, leading to a systematic bias. The equations proposed provide a good univariate representation of average lens power and are not subject to a systematic bias. They are particularly useful for the analysis of aggregate data, correlating with biological treatment variables and for developing analyses, which require a scalar equivalent representation of refractive power.",M1

Error cells are constructed for typical cylinder axes and an associated power. The geometry contains an elegant clinical determination for cross-cylinder compensation of astigmatism in terms of calculation friendly quantities. The extreme positions in the error cells define bounds for the cross-cylinder powers and their meridians.

SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Mainz University, Mainz, Germany. METHODS: Eyes were prospectively assigned (1:1) to have biaxial microincision (&lt;1.5 mm) phacoemulsification or coaxial small-incision (2.8 mm) phacoemulsification using pulsed ultrasound energy (Sovereign WhiteStar) with variable duty cycles followed by implantation of a microincision intraocular <e>lens</e>. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), laser flare photometry values, effective phacoemulsification time (EPT), and endothelial cell count (ECC) were evaluated. RESULTS: The study enrolled 94 eyes. There were no statistically significant differences between the techniques in intraoperative or postoperative complications. The most frequent postoperative complications were corneal edema surrounding the incision (40%, biaxial group; 35%, coaxial group), pupil distortion (3% versus 7%), and fibrin exudation (3% versus 3%). No other postoperative complications occurred. The median EPT was statistically significantly shorter (1.34 seconds versus 5.4 seconds) and the median phaco power significantly lower (3.3% versus 12.9%) in the biaxial group than in the coaxial group (P&lt;.001). There were no differences between groups in CDVA, laser flare photometry values, or ECC. CONCLUSIONS: The EPT was shorter and the mean phaco power lower with biaxial phacoemulsification, perhaps because of better access of the phaco handpiece for grooving the nucleus with this technique. The 2 techniques were comparable in intraoperative and postoperative complications.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical case study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four eyes of 22 patients who underwent cataract surgery at Kochi Medical School Hospital and its affiliated hospitals during the period from April 1994 to September 2007. METHODS: Twenty-four anterior lens capsules excised in cataract surgery underwent a histological examination and their clinical backgrounds were investigated. The TEX group consisted of 13 eyes with capsular delamination on the anterior lens capsule confirmed by slit-lamp microscopy before the surgery, and the DRS group consisted of 11 eyes that showed a double-ring sign during capsulorrhexis. RESULTS: Twenty-two eyes underwent phacoemulsification and aspiration after uneventful capsulorrhexis. Two eyes that showed phacodonesis underwent extracapsular cataract extraction. In all specimens the capsular delamination was confirmed. In some specimens from both groups, vesicle spaces were observed in the capsule and the underlying epithelium. In the TEX group, 8 eyes had capsular complications, such as pseudoexfoliation and phacodonesis, and in the DRS group, 2 eyes had phacodonesis (p = 0.016, student's t test).

METHODS: In this case-control study, data on cataract surgery cases with a capsule complication (study group) or with no complication (control group) in 2003 were extracted from the Swedish National Cataract Register. Patients with RD during a 3-year follow-up were identified. RESULTS: The study group comprised 324 patients and the control group, 331 patients. Retinal detachment occurred in 13 study group patients, for a 3-year incidence of 4.0%. In the control group, 1 patient (0.3%) had RD. Multivariate analysis showed an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 14.8 for RD after capsule complication (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-114; P = .01).

Twelve XFS eyes (71%) and six unaffected fellow eyes (35%) had grade 3 or 4 in at least one meridian (P = 0.07, Friedman test). CONCLUSION: Bilateral zonular involvement is present in subjects with clinically unilateral XFS. These zonular changes may be extensive in fellow eyes without clinically evident exfoliation material. UBM assessment of zonular status in fellow eyes prior to cataract extraction may aid in surgical planning.",M2
18721727,"Capsulorhexis phimosis after bimanual microphacoemulsification and in-the-bag implantation of the Akreos MI60 intraocular <e>lens</e>.An 80-year-old woman with corticonuclear cataract had cataract extraction by bimanual microphacoemulsification and in-the-bag implantation of the Akreos MI60 (Bausch &amp; Lomb) intraocular lens (IOL). After 6 months, a complete capsulorhexis phimosis developed and surgery was performed to open and reduce the phimosis, with complete functional recovery. In the fellow pseudophakic eye, an acrylic hydrophobic Acri. Smart 48S (Acri.Tec) IOL had been implanted without complications. We conclude that a capsulorhexis phimosis may occur a few months after uneventful cataract surgery and in-the-bag implantation of the Akreos MI60 IOL.",M2
18721709,"Comparison of anterior capsule contraction between 5 foldable intraocular <e>lens</e> models.PURPOSE: To compare anterior capsule contraction in cataract patients having implantation of 1 of 5 foldable intraocular lens (IOL) models and evaluate lens epithelial cell (LEC) adhesion to each model. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan. METHODS: This study comprised 115 patients (126 eyes) without systemic or ocular complications who had phacoemulsification with IOL implantation. The eyes were randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following IOLs: acrylic MA60BM (Alcon), SA60AT (Alcon), AR40e (Advanced Medical Optics), or YA-60BBR (Hoya) or a silicone AQ310NV (Canon). Two weeks and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively, the anterior capsule opening area was measured using an anterior segment analysis system (EAS-1000, Nidek) and the percentage of anterior capsule contraction was compared for each postoperative period and IOL. Cell adhesion to each IOL type was evaluated using LECs from albino rabbits. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 73.6 years +/- 5.6 (SD). Eyes with the AQ310NV and AR40e IOLs had statistically significantly greater anterior capsule contraction. The rabbit study showed statistically significantly less LEC adhesion on these 2 IOL models. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior capsule contraction was significantly greater with the AQ310NV and AR40e IOLs than with the other IOLs. Results indicate that cell adhesion to the IOL is an important factor in preventing anterior capsule contraction.",M2
18703950,"Possible association between long anterior <e>lens</e> zonules and plateau iris configuration.PURPOSE: To report plateau iris configuration (PIC) in subjects who have the long anterior zonule (LAZ) clinical trait. METHODS: Two elderly African American males who exhibited LAZ and had partial appositional angle closure persisting after laser iridotomy were imaged with high-resolution ultrasonography to examine for PIC. A third elderly LAZ subject who had narrow angles without closure was also imaged for PIC. Each subject was tested for a serine 163 arginine mutation (S163R) C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 5 gene (C1QTNF5/CTRP5) mutation, which may be associated with the LAZ phenotype. RESULTS: All 3 LAZ subjects also had PIC, an unlikely association due to chance alone. None carried the S163R CTRP5 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: LAZ and PIC may have association and require study because LAZ might be a useful indicator for an increased likelihood of PIC and risk of angle closure. Mutation other than CTRP5 S163R should also be considered for the LAZ trait, which could be an important phenotypic marker in genetic studies.",M2

METHODS: Medical charts of 21 patients diagnosed with PG between 1993 and 2006 at the Beijing Tongren Eye Center were reviewed. RESULTS: From our database, 14 men and seven women were identified as having PG. The mean age of the subjects at the time of the diagnosis was 35.3+/-6.8 years. All but one patient had myopia &gt;-0.5 diopters (D) with a mean spherical equivalent refractive error of -5.38+/-2.56 D. The average intraocular pressure at the initial diagnosis was 34.5+/-10.3 mmHg. All 17 patients with visibility chart documentation of the appearance of the peripheral <e>lens</e> and zonule showed lenticular and/or zonular pigmentation. The irides of all 15 subjects for whom detailed descriptions of the iris configuration were reported were bowed posteriorly. None of the subjects had iris transillumination defects (TIDs) except for trace areas of transillumination in both eyes of one patient.

DESIGN: Randomized clinical trials. METHODS: One hundred patients scheduled for bilateral cataract surgery were randomized to one of two groups: two or three relaxing incisions in the left eye and no incisions in the right eye, and relaxing incisions in the right eye and no incisions in the left eye. The anterior capsule opening area was measured using Scheimpflug photography immediately after capsulotomy and at one, three, and six months after capsulotomy, and the percentage reduction was calculated. The degree of intraocular <e>lens</e> (IOL) decentration and tilt and of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) also were examined. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the anterior capsule opening area between fellow eyes at baseline (P &gt; or = .1770). In patients who underwent two incisions, no significant difference was found between fellow eyes in the opening area (P &gt; or = .4098) or in the percentage of reduction (P &gt; or = .8730) throughout follow-up. In patients who underwent three incisions, the opening area in eyes with capsulotomy was significantly greater than that in eyes without capsulotomy (P &lt; or = .0154), and the percentage reduction was significantly smaller in eyes with capsulotomy than in eyes without capsulotomy (P &lt; or = .0016).

18299057,"Capsular block syndrome after cataract surgery: clinical analysis and classification.PURPOSE: To study the incidence of and risk factors for postoperative capsular block syndrome (CBS) and propose a new classification based on etiology. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Republic of Korea. METHODS: Charts of 1100 eyes of 990 patients who had phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular <e>lens</e> (PC IOL) implantation between January 2003 and June 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, axial length (AL), type of PC IOL implanted, and intraoperative ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs) were recorded. The cases of postoperative CBS were collected and the characteristic clinical findings evaluated. RESULTS: There were 8 cases (7 patients) of postoperative CBS (incidence 0.73%). Longer AL (&gt;or=25.0 mm) was a risk factor for postoperative CBS (P= .008; odds ratio [OR], 5.75, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.353-24.413). The PC IOL with 4 haptics (Akreos Adapt, Bausch &amp; Lomb) was also associated with an increased incidence of postoperative CBS (P= .001; OR, 7.388; 95% CI, 1.751-31.168). The CBS was classified as noncellular, inflammatory, or fibrotic according to the clinical characteristics.

METHODS: The cornea, iris, and lens of 30 eyes with XFS were imaged using the Rostock Cornea Module of Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II (50x noncontact Nikon lens, an estimated 1 to 2 mum transverse resolution, 500x500-mum field of view). Serial transverse section images, as well as anterior segment photographs, were taken and analyzed. RESULTS: The corneal stroma and endothelium of 19 eyes (63%) showed different amounts and sizes of scattered small hyperreflective deposits. The irides revealed hyperreflective deposits on the anterior outer surfaces and/or pupillary margin corresponding to exfoliation material (XFM) and/or pigment granules. The anterior lens capsule showed varying degrees of peripupillary fibrillar hyperreflective deposits, hyperreflective areas with apparent epithelial cells centrally, and uniform epithelial cells in the clear intermediate zone. On the anterior capsule in 4 pseudophakic eyes, XFM appeared as hyperreflective round deposits. Hyperreflective floating deposits were seen in the aqueous humor in the pupillary region of the posterior chamber of 6 eyes (20%). CONCLUSIONS: Noncontact in vivo confocal microscopy permits visualization of XFM in the cornea, iris, and lens. This new technique may improve early detection of anterior segment abnormalities by providing information about subclinical cellular pathology, such as early pregranular XFS.",M2

17972014,"Annular and central heavy pigment deposition on the posterior <e>lens</e> capsule in the pigment dispersion syndrome: pigment deposition on the posterior lens capsule in the pigment dispersion syndrome.PURPOSE: To report annular and central heavy pigment deposition on the posterior lens capsule in a case of pigment dispersion syndrome. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 36-year-old female with bilateral pigment dispersion syndrome presented with progressive decrease in visual acuity in the right eye over the past 1-2 years. Clinical examination revealed the typical findings of pigment dispersion syndrome including bilateral Krunkenberg spindles, iris transillumination defects, and dense trabecular meshwork pigmentation. Remarkably, annular and central dense pigmentation of the posterior lens capsule was noted in the right eye. CONCLUSION: Annular pigment deposition on the posterior lens capsule may be a rare finding associated with pigment dispersion syndrome. Such a finding suggests that there may be aqueous flow into the retrolental space in some patients with this condition. The way of central pigmentation is the entrance of aqueous to Berger's space. In our case, it is probable that spontaneous detachment of the anterior hyaloid membrane aided this entrance.",M2
17562063,"Proposed classification of <e>lens</e> capsule defects.BACKGROUND: Capsule defects are common during or after intraocular surgery of various kinds. The purpose of this work is to establish a classification system of lens capsule defects to provide uniform description of these defects for ophthalmic research and IOL implantation. METHODS: A retrospective study of 128 patients (156 eyes) with lens capsule injury after ocular trauma and intraocular surgery was performed. The patients were divided into two groups. Capsule defects were defined and classified according to the location, size, shape and tension of the capsule and its effect on posterior chamber IOL implantation. RESULTS: Lens capsule defects were classified into four types: Type I - complete capsule; Type II - incomplete capsule, but has enough area and tension to support two IOL haptics; Type III - incomplete capsule, is able to support only one IOL haptic and the other haptic needs a suture; Type IV - no capsule, both IOL haptics need suture fixation. Type I and Type II were each divided into three subtypes. Type III was divided into two subtypes. The shape of the capsule defects included fissure-like, triangle, round, irregular and fan-like. All eyes with capsule defects can be sorted into one of these types, and it is easy to guide IOL implantation according to the classification. Type II was the most common among the two groups in this study. CONCLUSION: The classification of lens capsule defects is feasible and favorable for uniform clinical description, clinical research and IOL implantation.",M2

METHODS: Retrospective chart review of pediatric cataract surgery cases with primary IOL implantation. RESULTS: Of 553 eyes that received IOL implantation by the lead author, 364 eyes were identified as having been implanted with an IOL at the time of surgery for a nontraumatic cataract. Nineteen (5.2%) of 364 eyes were diagnosed with posterior lentiglobus. The average age at surgery was 5.8 +/- 3.8 years (range, 0.6 to 13.9) years. All eyes had monocular cataract. Gender and ethnic distribution were as follows: male-female ratio, 12:7, and African American-Caucasian ratio, 4:15. A preexisting posterior capsule tear was noted at surgery in eight eyes, six of which presented with leukocoria from white cataracts. Site of IOL implantation was as follows: in-the-bag in 14 and sulcus in five, with optic capture into the anterior and posterior capsulotomy in four of those five. The average postoperative follow-up was 3.7 +/- 3.0 years. Median postoperative visual acuity was 20/30, and postoperative strabismus was noted in five eyes. Secondary surgery was required in one eye for visual axis opacification and one eye for lysis of synechiae (diagnosed with postoperative spike in intraocular pressure). No other intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed. CONCLUSION: Posterior lentiglobus causes a progressive unilateral cataract. Spontaneous rupture can result in leukocoria from a total white cataract. IOL implantation with posterior lentiglobus provided a satisfactory outcome in children.",M2

17122142,"CTRP5 is a membrane-associated and secretory protein in the RPE and ciliary body and the S163R mutation of CTRP5 impairs its secretion.PURPOSE: In a prior study, a S163R mutation in the complement-1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 5 (CTRP5/ C1QTNF5) was reported to be associated with early-onset long anterior zonules (LAZ) and late-onset retinal degeneration (L-ORD). The ocular tissues involved in the phenotype are the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the posterior segment and ciliary epithelium (CE) and <e>lens</e> in the anterior segment. The purpose of this study was to characterize the spatial and temporal expression of the mouse Ctrp5 gene, determine tissue and subcellular localization, and study the effect of the S163R mutation. METHODS: The expression of the Ctrp5 gene in the mouse was studied by quantitative (q)RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. CTRP5 protein expression and distribution were studied by Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunoelectron microscopy. Cellular location of wild-type and mutant CTRP5 in MDCK and COS-7 cells was determined by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: A significant level of Ctrp5 expression was detected in the adult mouse in the ciliary body (CB) and RPE, and expression started at a very early stage of embryogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed CTRP5 protein in the apical processes of the RPE and forming a hexagonal lattice associated with the RPE lateral membranes. In the ciliary body, CTRP5 was localized to the apical aspects of the CE, the region between the bilayered ciliary epithelial cells. The membrane association of CTRP5 in the RPE and CE was further confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. Furthermore, cultured cells were used to show that the CTRP5 is a secretory protein and that its secretion is impaired by the S163R mutation. CONCLUSIONS: CTRP5, a secretory and membrane-associated protein, is localized to the lateral and apical membranes of the RPE and CB. Impaired secretion of the mutant protein may underlie the pathophysiology of L-ORD and LAZ.",M2

METHODS: A 44-year-old man underwent sclerouvectomy for ciliochoroidal leiomyoma, during which 35 UNIH/mL lyophilized bovine thrombin mixed with 9 mL of diluent containing 1500 mmol/mL calcium chloride was used. From the first postoperative day, corneal and anterior lenticular capsule calcifications developed, and corneal involvement slightly enlarged thereafter. RESULTS: A year later, 2 corneal punch biopsies confirmed calcification mainly in the Bowman layer. Topical treatment with 1.5% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid significantly restored corneal clarity. Six months later, a standard extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular <e>lens</e> placement improved visual acuity to 20/60.

There was no history of trauma, surgery, or known systemic disease, and the patient presented with a unilateral, mobile, 4.0 mm white pseudohypopyon with no global pain, photophobia, or lacrimation. Although the eye was not injected on admission, repetitive head shaking resulted in dusky-red perilimbal hyperemia. A B-mode ultrasound revealed an advanced retinal detachment, and electroretinographic recordings were undetectable.

METHODS: Clinical ophthalmologic examination with visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and dilated ophthalmoscopy. Pedigree construction and evaluation for possible mode(s) of inheritance. RESULTS: In family 1, 25 members from four generations were available for examination. Twelve had identical findings consisting of a peripheral circumferential polychromatic band of anterior lens capsule. The band was predominantly iridescent green but exhibited a rainbow of colors on direct illumination with the slit-lamp beam. There were affected individuals in all four generations. The proband, one of her sons, and her granddaughter had no clinical, serologic, or other laboratory evidence of Wilson's disease, hypercupremia, or myotonic dystrophy. In family 2, three individuals in three generations were similarly affected. In family 3, a man and his son and daughter had identical peripheral lens capsule discoloration. CONCLUSIONS: Polychromasia capsulare is a rare benign autosomal dominant ocular trait that does not appear to be associated with ophthalmologic or systemic disease. The occurrence in consecutive generations and the presence of male-to-male transmission are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.",M2

16565002,"Diagnosis and management of bilateral posterior lenticonus in 7 members of the same family.PURPOSE: To report on the occurrence of monosymptomatic bilateral posterior lenticonus in 7 members of the same family and discuss the diagnoses and methods of management. SETTING: Eye Clinic, Cantonal Hospital, Lucerne, Switzerland. METHODS: Two sisters were found to suffer from bilateral posterior lenticonus. The 3 sons of the elder sister and the 2 daughters of the younger sister all presented with bilateral posterior lenticonus. A cataract operation or a clear <e>lens</e> extraction with intraocular lens implantation was performed in 4 of the 7 patients. RESULTS: The disorder was found to be inherited and to follow a pattern of autosomal dominance. Visual acuity improved to 20/20 in all operated eyes. CONCLUSION: This may be the largest group in 1 family presenting with bilateral posterior lenticonus described to date. Treatment of posterior lenticonus, if necessary, can be successfully managed as an ordinary cataract.",M2
16376663,"Long anterior <e>lens</e> zonules in late-onset retinal degeneration (L-ORD).PURPOSE: We report new findings of peripupillary iris atrophy and long anteriorly-inserted zonules in a family with late-onset retinal degeneration (L-ORD). DESIGN: The proband was noted to have anterior segment findings not previously described in L-ORD, an autosomal dominant condition resulting in severe visual impairment. A mutation in the C1QTNF5 (CTRP5) gene is causal. We identified family members with anterior segment findings. METHODS: Family members were examined with slit-lamp biomicroscopy and psychophysical tests including dark adaptation and visual fields. Genetic testing for the C1QTNF5 mutation was carried out. RESULTS: In this family with a proven mutation in this gene, peripupillary iris atrophy and abnormally long anterior zonular insertions were present before retinal changes and visual loss. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior segment findings have not previously been reported and along with impaired dark adaptation may serve as an early marker for this condition thus facilitating counseling and possible therapeutic intervention.",M2

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with posterior lens opacities that initially were thought to be too small in size to warrant cataract surgery. The following variables were examined: cataract type, location, diameter, persistent hyaloid vessel, anisometropia, strabismus, and age of detection. Success of treatment of amblyopia was defined as improvement by at least 0.3 logMAR units. Good visual outcome was defined as 20/40 or better. Amblyopia was treated by glasses, patching, and/or atropine. Patients who failed with conservative treatment or had an increase in cataract size underwent surgery. RESULTS: Forty-eight (91%) of 53 eyes were amblyopic. Thirty amblyopic eyes had pre- and post-treatment Snellen acuities. Twenty (67%) had their visual acuity (VA) improved by 0.3 logMAR units or greater. None of the measured variables were associated with successful amblyopia treatment. Twenty-five (49%) of 51 patients had a final VA of 20/40 or better. The only variable associated with good visual outcome was cataract type: 18 of 25 (72%) posterior subcapsular cataract and 6 of 23 (32%) posterior lenticonus eyes achieved VA of 20/40 or better (P = 0.008). Six patients who went on to have cataract surgery experienced a larger improvement in BCVA (4.50 logMar units +/- 2.52 lines) compared with patients treated without cataract surgery (2.36 logMar units +/- 3.11 lines). DISCUSSION: Amblyopia treatment was successful in most cases. A small group of patients who underwent cataract surgery experienced a greater VA improvement; however, it was not statistically significant. Further studies are needed to determine which patients would benefit from cataract surgery.",M2

METHODS: During a 31-month period, 5 practitioners in an urban, primary eye care setting examined consecutive patients for KS and PLS. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate relationships among KS, PLS, and other variables. RESULTS: Krukenberg spindles were present in 65 patients (52 females), comprised of 57 of 2647 (2.2%) blacks, 5 of 303 (1.7%) whites, 2 of 121 (1.7%) Hispanics, and 1 of 55 (1.8%) Asians. PLS were present in 64 subjects (56 females), comprised of 59 (2.2%) blacks, 3 (1.0%) whites, and 2 (3.6%) Asians. KS and PLS were coexistent in 27 subjects. Mean age +/- SD (range) of the KS and PLS subjects was 63.1 +/- 15.0 years (24-88 years) and 67.0 +/- 10.4 years (33-88 years), respectively. Mean refractive error +/- SD (range) of KS and PLS right eyes was +0.55 +/- 2.32D (-6.50 to +5.50D) and +1.34 +/- 2.18D (-6.50 to +7.25D), respectively. Controlling for other variables, PLS were highly predictive (OR = 30.2, P &lt; 0.0001) of KS, and KS were highly predictive (OR = 29.5, P &lt; 0.0001) of PLS. Ignoring presence or absence of PLS, increasing age (in decades) (OR = 1.60, P &lt; 0.0001) was strongly associated with KS. Ignoring presence or absence of KS, age (OR = 1.74, P &lt; 0.0001), female gender (OR = 2.96, P = 0.009), and increasing hyperopic refractive error (OR = 1.30, P &lt; 0.0001) were strongly associated with PLS.

METHODS: Case report of bilateral simultaneous corneal graft dehiscence with expulsion of the <e>lens</e> and iris as a result of airbag-induced trauma. RESULTS: Both corneal buttons were resutured, the prolapsed iris tissue was repositioned in the right eye, and anterior vitrectomy was performed bilaterally. Topical and systemic antibiotics, topical steroids, cycloplegic agents, and antiglaucoma drugs were initiated. Repeated B-scan ultrasound examinations demonstrated an attached retina in both eyes. Three weeks after admission, the right eye was reoperated for removal of remnant lens material and additional anterior vitrectomy. The patient was fitted with polycarbonate spectacles with an optical correction of +8 in both eyes. Visual acuity improved to 20/200 and 0.5/60 in the right and left eyes, respectively. The right corneal graft regained transparency, but the left one remained hazy. CONCLUSION: Airbag deployment during motor vehicle collisions is a significant cause of ocular morbidity. The reported risk of airbag-related eye injury is 2.5% for any eye injury and 0.4% for severe eye injury. Patients undergoing corneal surgery should be counseled about the weakness of the donor-recipient interface and should consider wearing protective glasses.",M2
15599585,"Accommodation after Nd: YAG capsulotomy in patients with accommodative posterior chamber <e>lens</e> 1CU.PURPOSE: After initial encouraging results with the accommodative 1CU posterior chamber lens (PCIOL), we investigated the rate, the postoperative time point of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) necessitating YAG capsulotomy and the accommodative range after Nd: YAG capsulotomy in patients with 1CU-PCIOL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective clinical study included 65 patients who underwent phacoemulsification and implantation of the accommodative 1CU-PCIOL with postoperative follow-up from 3 to 24 months. Postoperative examination was performed 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, then before and 6 weeks after Nd: YAG capsulotomy. Measurements included: the best corrected distance visual acuity, distance refraction, near visual acuity (Birkhauser charts in 35 cm) obtained with best distance correction, accommodative range measured by subjective near point with an accodommometer and defocusing with a visual acuity fall to 0.4. RESULTS: Both best corrected distance visual acuity (1.1+/-0.1) and near visual acuity with best distance correction (0.4+/-0.1) remained stable over the follow-up period until 12 months postoperatively. The accommodative range determined by near point was stable (mean 2.0+/-0.5 D). Also, the defocusing range remained stable over 12 months (1.8+/-0.4 D). A clinically relevant posterior capsule opacification with a significant decrease of visual acuity (0.4+/-0.2) and a need for Nd: YAG capsulotomy was diagnosed in 12 patients between 15 and 22 (mean 20+/-4, median 20) months postoperatively. All capsulotomies were performed without complication. Six weeks after capsulotomy, best corrected distance visual acuity was improved (1.1+/-0.1), near visual acuity with best distance correction was 0.4+/-0.1 and the accommodative range determined by near point was 1.95+/-0.6 D and by defocusing was 1.88+/-0.47 D. Six weeks after capsulotomy, measurements of the accommodative range did not show any statistical difference to the 12-month results before the occurrence of PCO (P&gt;0.5). CONCLUSIONS: A clinically relevant PCO with a significant decrease of visual acuity necessitating Nd: YAG capsulotomy occurred mainly after 15 postoperative months in patients with 1CU. Our results indicate that Nd: YAG capsulotomy may not affect the accommodation ability of the 1CU. Nevertheless, long-term studies are needed to further analyze the accommodative properties.",M2

One of three cases developed angle closure. Robb described catastrophic vision loss from angle closure in one of his seven cases. METHODS: We did a retrospective review of previously unreported cases of pupil-iris-lens membrane with goniodysgenesis seen in our practices. RESULTS: We report the clinical spectrum of a further nine cases, three of which needed surgery for angle closure, two of which needed surgery for clearing the visual axis. CONCLUSION: Congenital pupil-iris-lens membrane with goniodysgenesis is a unilateral membrane clearly differentiated from benign persistent tunica vasculosa lentis tissue. The membrane represents ectopic iris on the lens with abnormal iris stroma and chamber angle from aberrant induction, migration, or regression of neural crest cells. The membrane can be progressive. Catastrophic vision loss from angle closure can occur and may be controlled with surgery. Surgery may be needed to open the visual axis even when glaucoma is not present and may prevent angle closure.",M2

SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, University of Vienna Medical School, Vienna, Austria. METHOD: In a prospective study, a Collamer CC4204BF IOL was implanted in 30 eyes of patients with senile cataract. A standardized surgical technique and postoperative regimen were applied. To assess uveal biocompatibility, cellular inflammation on the anterior IOL surface was evaluated with a specular microscope. Capsular biocompatibility was registered semiquantitatively with a biomicroscope, based on an assessment of fibrosis on the anterior and posterior capsules. Tyndall values were measured with the Kowa FC-1000 laser flare-cell meter. Decentration of the lens was also registered. RESULTS: One year after implantation, the values of flare and cell count in the anterior chamber were lower than preoperatively. Round and spindle-shaped, epithelioid, and foreign-body giant cells were not found on the anterior surface of the IOL. The capsulorhexis rim was moderately fibrosed in 56.6% of cases. Fibrosis of the capsule over the optic was also moderate in 36.6%. The central portion of the posterior capsule was devoid of fibrosis in 43.3% and mildly fibrosed in 50%. Three lenses revealed outgrowth of lens epithelial cells to the anterior surface of the IOL. A neodymium:YAG capsulotomy had to be performed in 1 case. All lenses were well centered in the capsular bag 1 year after implantation. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of inflammatory cells on the anterior surface of the IOL indicates the high uveal biocompatibility of the lens. In terms of capsular biocompatibility, the results were satisfactory.",M2
15161859,"Quantitative trait locus mapping for age-related cataract severity and synechia prevalence using four-way cross mice.PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to map mouse quantitative trait loci (QTL) that influence the development of murine age-related cataract and synechia, by using a genetically heterogeneous mouse population bred by a four-way cross. METHODS: The test population consisted initially of 510 mice bred as the progeny of (BALB/cJ x C57BL/6J)F1 females and (C3H/HeJ x DBA/2J)F1 males. Each mouse was examined by slit lamp at 18 and 24 months of age and scored for degree of <e>lens</e> opacity on a 0 to 4+ scale, and the presence or absence of additional anterior chamber disease was noted. The presence of synechia was confirmed by histology. Each mouse was genotyped at 96 maternal and 92 paternal loci, and the significance of association between genotype and eye lesions was tested by permutation analysis. RESULTS: Significant QTL with effects on lens opacity at 24 months were detected on mouse chromosomes 4, 11, and 12. The effects were additive, and severe cataracts were seen in 80% of the mice with all three high-risk alleles, but in only 28% of the mice with all three low-risk alleles. The risk of synechia was associated with paternal chromosome 1 and on both the maternal and paternally inherited chromosome 4. Mice with all three high-risk alleles had a 68% risk of synechia, compared with a 0% incidence in mice with all three counteralleles. CONCLUSIONS: A four-way cross population of mice can be used to map polymorphic loci that influence cataract severity and synechia prevalence in late life. The results provide a first step toward identification of the individual genes involved and may help to guide the search for homologous human genes.",M2

On the day after surgery, biomicroscopy revealed vertical wrinkles limited to the central 2.0 mm of the posterior capsule corresponding to the cone in the eyes in which the IOLs had been vertically placed. We hypothesize that these striae occurred within the cone as a result of redistributing the usual mechanical forces associated with capsule stretch between the most distal contact points of the haptics.

SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology and Neurosurgery, University of Siena, Siena, Italy. METHODS: Seventy-three eyes of 57 patients with high myopia who had phacoemulsification without IOL implantation from 1993 to 1996 were retrospectively reviewed. The mean postoperative follow-up was 62.3 months and the mean axial length, 30.22 mm (range 29.10 to 33.70 mm). The incidence of RD and preoperative and postoperative prophylactic argon laser photocoagulation for rhegmatogenous retinal lesions were assessed. Between 1997 and 2000, ACO was evaluated subjectively and PCO was evaluated using the EPCO photographic image-analysis system. The incidence of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy was noted. RESULTS: Argon laser photocoagulation was performed in 8 eyes (10.9%) preoperatively and 3 eyes (4.1%) postoperatively. One RD (1.3%) was observed 26 months after surgery; no preoperative or postoperative prophylactic argon laser photocoagulation or Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy was performed in this eye. At 1 year, 49 eyes (67.1%) had mild ACO and 24 (32.8%) had anterior capsule fibrosis. The data did not change during subsequent follow-up visits. At 6 years, the mean PCO grade was 1.109 (range 0.972 to 2.931); an Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy was performed in 12 eyes (16.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other studies that evaluated the outcomes of highly myopic patients who had cataract surgery with posterior chamber IOL implantation, our patients, who did not have IOL implantation, had a lower incidence of postoperative rhegmatogenous retinal lesions requiring argon laser treatments and a similar incidence of postoperative RD and visually significant PCO.",M2
12842198,"Cornea with Peters' anomaly: perturbed differentiation of corneal cells and abnormal extracellular matrix in the corneal stroma.PURPOSE: We examined histopathologically the anterior ocular segment including the cornea and <e>lens</e> of an eye which had been enucleated in a patient with Peters' anomaly because of untreatable corneal perforation. Special effort was made to differentiate the corneal stromal and endothelial cells, and the stromal extracellular matrix. METHODS: Light microscopy, with hematoxylin and eosin staining, and transmission electron microscopy were employed. RESULTS: Corneal endothelial cells and Descemet's membrane were not detected in the central cornea, where there were immature cells with a fibroblastic configuration. The inner surface of the peripheral cornea was covered with cells containing pigment granules in the cytoplasm. Cell density in the central corneal stroma was relatively high. The diameter of the stromal collagen fibrils was not uniform. A mature collagen fibril-free area was also seen in the central corneal stroma. CONCLUSIONS: Differentiation of neural crest-derived cells in corneal stroma and endothelium might have been perturbed in the cornea of this patient with Peters' anomaly, inducing the defect in the corneal endothelium and the qualitative and quantitative abnormalities of the extracellular matrix.",M2
12796257,"Immunohistochemical and molecular genetic evidence for type IV collagen alpha5 chain abnormality in the anterior lenticonus associated with Alport syndrome.OBJECTIVE: To present evidence for a type IV collagen alpha5 chain (alpha5[IV]) abnormality in the anterior <e>lens</e> capsule of a patient with anterior lenticonus associated with Alport syndrome. METHODS: The anterior lens capsule obtained from a 54-year-old man with anterior lenticonus associated with Alport syndrome was examined ultrastructurally and stained immunohistochemically for the alpha chains of type IV collagen, alpha1(IV) to alpha6(IV). A search was also made for a mutation in the COL4A5 complementary DNA encoding the alpha5(IV) chain by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of illegitimate transcripts. RESULTS: The anterior lens capsule of the patient was much thinner than that of normal subjects and lacked the alpha3(IV) to alpha6(IV) chains immunohistochemically, while control specimens stained positively for all of the alpha(IV) chains. The patient had a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 5231 causing a nonsense mutation, R1677X, in the COL4A5 complementary DNA. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that normal anterior lens capsules express all of the alpha(IV) chains and that a patient with anterior lenticonus associated with Alport syndrome had a mutation in the COL4A5 gene resulting in the lack of immunoreactivity to alpha3(IV) to alpha6(IV) chains in the anterior lens capsule. Clinical Relevance This study showed abnormal composition of alpha(IV) chains in the anterior lens capsule of a patient with anterior lenticonus caused by a nonsense mutation in the COL4A5 gene. Further investigation of the phenotype-genotype relationship will provide a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of anterior lenticonus.",M2
12760811,"[Application of capsular tension ring in cataract surgery for zonular dialysis]OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the application of capsular tension ring (CTR) in the cataract surgery for zonular dialysis. METHODS: Eleven cases of partially traumatized zonular dialysis patients were managed with CTR after continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis (CCC), cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular <e>lens</e> (IOL) implantation. RESULTS: The IOLs in all the eyes were basically in the normal position without tilting or obvious decentration. One month postoperatively, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.4 in 4 eyes, 0.5-0.8 in 5 eyes and over 0.8 in 2 eyes. A side-by-side overlap of both eyelets of the ring happened in 1 eye due to the bigger diameter of CTR, and no other complications were seen except the original complication of cataract surgery. CONCLUSIONS: For the patients of zonular dialysis, the CTR can preserve the integrity of the capsular bag, provide the necessary capsular space while giving a counter-traction, reduce asymmetric capsular forces, stabilize the vitreous base, facilitate phacoemulsification, aspiration of cortex and IOL implantation, prevent the postoperative IOL decentration and allow a quicker visual recovery. The CTR is a useful device that effectively supplements the currently available cataract surgery armamentarium, and develops the application of posterior chamber IOL implantation.",M2

12648643,"Efficacy of a capsular tension ring for phacoemulsification in eyes with zonular dialysis.PURPOSE: To determine the safety and efficacy of capsular tension ring (CTR) insertion in eyes with zonular dialysis of less than 150 degrees having phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular <e>lens</e> (PC IOL) implantation. SETTING: Dr. Agarwal's Eye Hospital, Chennai, India. METHODS: This prospective study comprised 21 eyes of 19 patients with zonular dialysis of less than approximately 150 degrees determined preoperatively or intraoperatively. After insertion of a CTR, phacoemulsification with PC IOL implantation was performed. The mean follow-up was 242.33 days. RESULTS: Capsule collapse did not occur in any eye with a CTR. Intraoperative extension of the dialysis occurred in 2 eyes (9.52%). The IOL was placed in the bag in all the eyes except 1 that had traumatic cataract and received a scleral-fixated IOL during a subsequent surgery. Postoperatively, there was minimal corneal edema in 2 eyes (9.52%) and mild iritis in 5 eyes (23.80%). Three eyes (14.28%) developed raised intraocular pressure that responded well to medical therapy. The symptoms resolved in the 3 patients with preoperative diplopia. Fifteen eyes (71.42%) had a final visual acuity of 6/12 or better. Six eyes had a final best corrected visual acuity of worse than 6/12 because of coexisting fundus pathology. A dilated pupil examination at 6 months showed a well-centered IOL in all eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Phacoemulsification with in-the-bag PC IOL and CTR implantation in eyes with zonular dialysis of up to approximately 150 degrees had a success rate of 90.47%. Visual recovery was not as good as in normal eyes because of the problems associated with zonular dialysis.",M2
12462536,"Prevalence of pigmented <e>lens</e> striae in a black population: a potential indicator of age-related pigment dispersal in the anterior segment.PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of pigmented striae of the anterior lens capsule, with or without associated glaucoma, in a black primary eye care population. METHODS: Over a 16-month period, five practitioners searched for pigmented lens striae (PLS) among consecutive patients who underwent pupillary dilation during routine eye care provided within the primary care service of an urban eye clinic in Chicago, Illinois. RESULTS: Meeting the inclusion criteria were 1608 blacks (mean age +/- SD, 40.9 +/- 23.7 years; range, 5 to 100; 1056 females, 552 males). Among the group, 29 (1.8%) subjects had PLS (mean age, 66.5 +/- 11.3 years; range, 33 to 88; 25 females, 4 males). PLS were bilateral 89% of the time. Sixteen of the 29 (55%) blacks had central corneal endothelial pigment dusting (14 bilateral), frequently creating a well-formed Krukenberg's spindle. Trabecular pigmentation varied among the PLS subjects from mild to heavy. Using multiple logistic regression, age (in years) (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.07; p = 0.0003), female gender (odds ratio, 4.46; 95% confidence interval; 1.03 to 19.19; p = 0.045), and hyperopic refractive error (in diopters) (odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval; 1.09 to 1.67; p = 0.006) were significant predictors of PLS. CONCLUSIONS: PLS were present in about 1.8% (2.4% females, 0.7% males) of our black population, and they were frequently associated with other signs of intraocular pigment dispersion. Age, female gender, and refractive error were significant predictors for PLS. This is new information that is helpful for understanding a clinical sign that may be an indicator of age-related pigment dispersal within the anterior segment.",M2

12010209,"Central retinal vein occlusion in pseudoexfoliation of the <e>lens</e> capsule.In surveying an extensive group of patients with unilateral pseudoexfoliation of the lens capsule certain interesting points emerged, particularly on the incidence of central retinal vein occlusion in this condition,and perhaps in glaucoma also. A total of 284 patients with unilateral pseudo-exfoliation of the lens capsule were examined clinically after an ophthalmic and general history were taken. Mean intraocular pressure (IOP) was 30.9 mmHg in the affected eye and 18.1 mmHg in the unaffected eye. Central retinal vein occlusion occurred in 10 affected eyes but no unaffected eyes and always in affected eyes with a rise in IOP. Average IOP in the affected eye with central retinal vein occlusion was 37.5 mmHg (range 26-54 mmHg);in the unaffected fellow eye it was 18.0 mmHg (range 11-28 mmHg). Although the process involved in producing pseudo-exfoliation of the lens capsule may contribute to the precipitation of central retinal vein occlusion, these findings suggest the rise in IOP is the more important cause.

The anterior segment changes consisted of the absence of the iridial pupillary sphincter muscle and dilator muscle processes. Endothelialization and descemetization of the anterior chamber angle and the anterior surface of the iris covered the original eccentric pupillary opening (occlusio pupillae), but grew around the fibrotic edges of the surgically created, patent pseudopupil, probably secondary responses to surgery. The anterior chamber findings in this case establish a localized syndrome that includes absence of the pupillary sphincter and dilator muscle processes. Incomplete development of the iris may be partly attributable to an abnormality of stromal development and inductions by the anterior neuroectodermal layer, together with anomalies of the pupillo-iridial vasculature.",M3
20479705,"A novel capsulorhexis technique using shearing forces with cystotome.PURPOSE: To demonstrate a capsulorhexis technique using predominantly shearing forces with a cystotome on a virtual reality simulator and on a human eye. METHOD: Our technique involves creating the initial anterior capsular tear with a cystotome to raise a flap. The flap left unfolded on the <e>lens</e> surface. The cystotome tip is tilted horizontally and is engaged on the flap near the leading edge of the tear. The cystotome is moved in a circular fashion to direct the vector forces. The loose flap is constantly swept towards the centre so that it does not obscure the view on the tearing edge. RESULTS: Our technique has the advantage of reducing corneal wound distortion and subsequent anterior chamber collapse. The capsulorhexis flap is moved away from the tear leading edge allowing better visualisation of the direction of tear. This technique offers superior control of the capsulorhexis by allowing the surgeon to change the direction of the tear to achieve the desired capsulorhexis size. CONCLUSIONS: The EYESI Surgical Simulator is a realistic training platform for surgeons to practice complex capsulorhexis techniques. The shearing forces technique is a suitable alternative and in some cases a far better technique in achieving the desired capsulorhexis.",M3

SETTING: Ophthalmology Department, Maryknoll Hospital, Busan, Korea. METHODS: This study evaluated eyes that had phacoemulsification with IOL implantation to treat phacomorphic glaucoma. Intraocular pressure (IOP), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were measured preoperatively and postoperatively. The minimum follow-up was 48 months. RESULTS: The mean IOP in the 26 eyes was 49.0 mm Hg +/- 10.4 (SD) (range 31 to 70 mm Hg) preoperatively and 13.2 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (range 8 to 20 mm Hg) 48 months postoperatively (P&lt;.0001, paired t test). No eye had increased IOP over the follow-up. The postoperative IOP was significantly lower 1 day postoperatively (P&lt;.000, paired t test). The improvement in CDVA was statistically significant from 1 week postoperatively (P&lt;.0001, paired t test). The CDVA improved postoperatively except in 1 eye with a preoperative acuity of no light perception. The CDVA was 20/50 or better in 16 eyes (61.5%). Preoperatively, the ACD was shallow (mean 1.5 +/- 0.3 mm) because of the swollen lens; the mean postoperative ACD was 2.6 +/- 0.1 mm; the increase was statistically significant. The mean preoperative ratio of lens thickness to axial length was 0.25 +/- 0.01, indicating a shallow ACD. In 1 eye, peripheral anterior synechias were seen on gonioscopy immediately after surgery; the eye required continuous postoperative medication for IOP control.

20412792,"Hydration water/interfacial water in crystalline <e>lens</e>.Wide-line (1)H NMR signal intensity, spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation rates and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were done on avian (chicken and turkey) crystalline lenses between -70 degrees C and +45 degrees C to provide quantitative measures of protein hydration characteristic of the protein-water interfacial region. These measures are of paramount importance in understanding both the physiology of crystalline lens and its transitions to the cataractous pathological state characterized by the formation of opaque protein aggregates. Water mobility shows a characteristic transition at about -60 degrees C, which is identified as the melting of the interfacial/hydrate water. The amount of water in the low-temperature mobile fraction is about h = 0.4 g water/g protein, which equals the hydration required for protein activity. The amount of mobile water is temperature-independent up to about -10 degrees C, with a significant increase at higher temperatures below 0 degrees C. Above 0 degrees C, the relaxation processes can be described by a single (for spin-lattice) and by a triple (for spin-spin relaxation) exponential function. The spin-spin relaxation rate component of R(2) = 10-20 s(-1) and its dynamical parameters characterize the interfacial water at ambient or physiological temperatures. When considered an independent phase, the specific heat of the hydrate water obtained by a combination of DSC and NMR data in the temperature range -43 degrees C to -28 degrees C is higher than that of pure/bulk water. This discrepancy can only be resolved by assuming that the hydrate water is in strong thermodynamic coupling with the protein matrix. The specific heat for the system composed of the protein molecule and its hydration water is 4.6 +/- 0.3 J g(-1) K(-1). Thus, in a thermodynamic sense, crystalline protein and its hydrate layer behave as a highly-interconnected single phase.",M3

METHODS: Human lens epithelial (HLE) B-3 cells were cultured. Cells were treated for 45 min with H2O2 and signal transducers and activators transcription (STAT) 3, JAK2, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were surveyed by Western blot analysis. After pretreatment with either 40 microM AG490 or 25 microM U0126, LECs were exposed to H(2)O(2). LEC death was evaluated by microscopy and flow cytometry. RESULTS: H(2)O(2) induced phosphorylation of Tyr-705 STAT3, JAK2, and ERK1/2 in LECs. In cells pretreated with both AG490 and U0126, phosphorylation of Tyr-705 STAT3, JAK2, and ERK1/2 was suppressed. Microscopic findings, however, showed that only AG490 noticeably enhanced cell survival, and flow cytometry showed that cell necrosis decreased to 4.05% after pretreatment with 40 microM AG490. CONCLUSIONS: AG490 may prevent H(2)O(2)-induced LEC death by blocking an unknown necrosis pathway. Further investigation is required to characterize that pathway.",M3
20400629,"Electrophysiological assessment of spectral sensitivity in adult Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus: evidence for violet sensitivity.The cichlid fish radiations of the African Great Lakes are an important model for evolutionary biology. Cichlids have diverse colour vision systems and predominately express three cone visual pigments. However, rare populations of spectrally distinct cones have been found in a number of species, but it is not known whether they contribute to spectral sensitivity. Adult Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, an ancestral outgroup to the cichlid radiations in the Great Lakes, have three cone types: short-wavelength sensitive (SWS), medium-wavelength sensitive (MWS) and long-wavelength sensitive (LWS) cones, but evidence from microspectrophotometry and cone opsin gene expression suggests they may also have violet-sensitive (VS) cones. We used electrophysiology to assess spectral sensitivity in this species and found evidence of four sensitivity peaks in the ranges 380-420, 440-480, 500-600 and 600-680 nm, with maximal sensitivity at longer wavelengths. The continued presence of a 380-420 nm peak under long-wavelength chromatic adapting backgrounds indicates that this is due to a VS cone mechanism not the beta-band of the LWS cone mechanism. Differences in spectral sensitivity curves recorded at different times of year revealed evidence of A1/A2 shifts. The presence of notches in the sensitivity curves and a multiple-mechanisms model used to assess cone contributions indicated that the curves are the result of four cone mechanisms (VS, SWS, MWS and LWS cones) and that chromatically opponent processes occur between mechanisms. The spectral transmittance of the <e>lens</e> steeply declines between 410-380 nm, limiting the short-wavelength limb of the VS cone. As adults, Nile tilapia appear to possess the necessary retinal mechanisms for colour vision. While maximal sensitivity to longer wavelengths is an adaptation to the wavelengths of light predominantly available in their natural habitats, their broad sensitivity range suggests that Nile tilapia possess a flexible, generalised visual system able to adapt to changes in visual environment in their highly variable natural habitat.",M3
20395299,"Amino acid residue Val362 plays a critical role in maintaining the structure of C terminus of connexin 50 and in <e>lens</e> epithelial-fiber differentiation.We have previously shown that connexin (Cx) 50, unlike the other two lens connexins, Cx43 and Cx46, promotes chicken lens epithelial-fiber differentiation in a channel-independent manner. Here, we show that deletion of the PEST motif at the C terminus (CT) domain of Cx50 attenuates the stimulatory effect of Cx50 on lens fiber differentiation. Valine 362, a residue located within the PEST domain, is functionally involved. The structure of the Cx50 CT predicted by molecular modeling revealed four alpha-helices and Val(362) was found to be located in the middle of the 3rd helix. Replacement of Val(362) with amino acid residues that disrupt the alpha-helical structure predicted by molecular modeling, such as arginine, glutamate, or phenylalanine, attenuated the stimulatory effects of Cx50 on lens differentiation, whereas replacement with threonine, isoleucine, leucine, or proline, which maintain the structure preserved the function of Cx50. Circular dichroism (CD) studies supported the structural predictions and showed that the substitution with Glu, but not Thr or Pro, disrupted the alpha-helix, which appears to be the structural feature important for lens epithelial-fiber differentiation. Together, our results suggest that Val(362) is important for maintaining the helical structure and is crucial for the role of Cx50 in promoting lens epithelial-fiber differentiation.",M3

SETTING: Division of Ophthalmology, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: Before capsulorhexis, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Trypan blue 0.1% staining was performed in the treatment group. No trypan blue was used in the control group. Samples of capsules with LECs were fixed and analyzed with routine optical microscopy techniques, immunohistochemistry for beclin-1 expression (a marker of autophagy), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling to detect apoptosis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Morphometric analyses were performed, and the 2 sets of data were compared. RESULTS: Each group comprised 15 patients. Cell death by autophagy and apoptosis was observed in the treatment group but not in the control group. The TEM images of subcapsular epithelium cells showed mitochondrial rupture, dilation of the cisterns of the endoplasmic reticulum, increased cytoplasmic and nuclear electron density, and abnormalities in the nuclear profile of trypan blue-stained cells. Morphometric analysis showed statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in the longest nuclear axes and the ratio between the total nuclear perimeter and the cell area (P = .03). The difference in capsule thickness between groups was not significant. CONCLUSION: Trypan blue caused LEC death, which supports the hypothesis that staining with trypan blue 0.1% can help reduce the incidence of posterior capsule opacification after cataract surgery.

20352024,"Identification of crystallin modifications in the human <e>lens</e> cortex and nucleus using laser capture microdissection and CyDye labeling.PURPOSE: With aging, lens crystallins undergo post-translational modifications (PTMs) and these modifications are believed to play a major role in age-related cataract development. The purpose of the present study was to determine the protein profiles of crystallins and their PTMs in the cortical and nuclear regions within an aging human lens to gain a better understanding about changes in crystallins as fiber cells migrate from cortical to nuclear region. METHODS: Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to select and capture cells from cortical and nuclear regions of 12 mum, optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound-embedded frozen lens sections from a 69-year-old human lens. Proteins were extracted and then analyzed by 2-D difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) with sulfonated indocyanine dye (CyDye) labeling. Crystallin identities and their PTMs were then determined by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) and Electrospray Ionization Quadripole Linear Ion-Trap Liquid Chromatography (ESI-QTRAP LC-MS/MS) mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Crystallin fragments (M(r) &lt;20 kDa) were present in both cortical and nuclear regions, while high molecular weight (HMW) aggregates (M(r) &gt; 35 kDa) were mostly localized in the nuclear region. HMW complexes contained a relatively large number of truncated and modified beta-crystallins, compared to alpha- and gamma-crystallins, and two lens-specific intermediate filaments, CP49 (phakinin) and filensin. Modified alpha-crystallins were in low abundance in the nuclear region compared to the cortical region. Several PTMs, including deamidation, oxidation, phosphorylation, ethylation, methylation, acetylation, and carbamylation, were identified in virtually all crystallins and CP49. The data provide the first report of human lens crystallin profiling by a combination of LCM, 2D-DIGE, and mass spectrometric analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that as the fiber cells migrate from cortical region to the nuclear region, the crystallin degradation begins in the cortical region and continues in the nuclear region. However, a greater number of the HMW complexes exist mainly in the nuclear region.",M3
20352023,"Oxidative stress in <e>lens</e> in vivo: inhibitory effect of caffeine. A preliminary report.PURPOSE: Experiments have been conducted to study the hypothesis that caffeine would inhibit reactive oxygen species induced oxidative stress in the lens in vivo, with implications of attenuating or preventing cataract formation. METHODS: Oxidative stress was directly induced by administering 24% galactose diet to young adult rats. The treated group was fed a diet containing 24% galactose + 1% caffeine. Oxidative stress inflicted to the lens was assessed by measurement of glutathione (GSH) depletion and observing the status of lens clarity. RESULTS: Caffeine administration was found to minimize the loss of GSH. This was also associated with a better maintenance of lens transparency as compared to the untreated galactosemic group. CONCLUSIONS: The studies demonstrate that caffeine could be helpful in inhibiting oxidative stress in the lens with the consequence of attenuating cataract formation.",M3
20348463,"In vivo quantification of the retinal reflectance spectral composition in elderly subjects before and after cataract surgery: Implications for the non-visual effects of light.Light is the signal that entrains the biological clock in humans to the 24-hour external time. Recently, it has been shown that short wavelengths play a key role in this process. In the present study, we describe a procedure to measure, objectively and in a quick way, the spectral composition of the light reaching the retina in vivo. The instruments involved are the foveal reflection analyzer (FRA) and the macular pigment reflectometer (MPR). By making use of these reflectometers, we show quantitatively that in subjects with cataracts, the light input is especially reduced in the short wavelength range. After cataract surgery during which the crystalline <e>lens</e> is replaced by a transparent artificial lens, the transmittance of the short wavelengths (between 420-500 nm) improved on average by a factor of 4. We conclude that this technique holds great promises for the chronobiological field because it allows for quantification of the spectral composition and light levels reaching the retina in vivo.",M3
20347182,"[Acute angle closure and angle closure glaucoma: Phacoemulsification as first-line treatment]Angle closure glaucoma is characterized by an optic neuropathy with a glaucomatous visual field defect with a white painless eye and mimics primary open-angle glaucoma. Acute angle closure attack is more symptomatic, with a red painful eye and elevated intraocular pressure. In both cases, iridocorneal angle closure is due to an increase in the thickness of the natural <e>lens</e>, which with age has a tendency to close a narrow angle. The rational approach to treating these situations is lens extraction. With today's improved lens extraction techniques, this surgical treatment should be proposed more frequently.",M3
20346776,"Ultraviolet-B phototoxicity and hypothetical photomelanomagenesis: intraocular and crystalline <e>lens</e> photoprotection.PURPOSE: Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation can cause phototoxic macular injuries in young people who have been sunbathing but not sungazing and in welders. Welders have a reportedly increased risk of uveal melanoma. We analyze phakic and pseudophakic risks for solar and welding arc UV-B exposure. DESIGN: Optical radiation measurement, analysis, and perspective. METHODS: Spectral transmittances were measured for UV-transmitting, UV-blocking, and blue-blocking intraocular lenses (IOLs). The photoprotective performances of crystalline and intraocular lenses were analyzed using relevant epidemiologic and laboratory data and action spectra for acute retinal phototoxicity and melanoma photocarcinogenesis. RESULTS: Crystalline lens UV-B retinal protection is deficient in children and young adults, increasing their potential susceptibility to acute retinal phototoxicity and hypothetical photomelanomagenesis. UV-B radiation has sufficient energy/photon to induce primary melanomagenic DNA lesions, unlike blue light or UV-A radiation. UV-blocking and blue-blocking IOLs have negligible UV-B transmittance. UV-transmitting IOL transmittance of UV-B radiation is equivalent to that of a 15-year-old crystalline lens. CONCLUSIONS: If optical radiation exposure is responsible for welders' increased risk of uveal melanoma, then UV-B radiation is the most probable causative agent and spectacle wear is a potential confounding factor in epidemiologic studies of ocular melanoma. Welders under 30 years of age are at greater risk for welding maculopathy than older welders. Children, adults under 30 years of age, and pseudophakic individuals with UV-transmitting IOLs should wear sunglasses in bright environments because of the UV-B window in their crystalline lenses or IOLs.",M3
20335811,"Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty in the phakic eye.PURPOSE: To evaluate the visual acuity, graft clarity, refractive outcome, and crystalline <e>lens</e> clarity in phakic patients undergoing Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). METHODS: Six eyes of 4 consecutive patients with clear crystalline lenses and corneal edema because of either Fuchs dystrophy (4 eyes) or amantadine-induced corneal endothelial toxicity (2 eyes) were included in this study. All patients underwent simple DSAEK using a 4.2-mm temporal clear corneal incision. The 8.5-mm donor lenticule was folded and inserted into the anterior chamber using an Utrata forceps. A 10-minute air bubble tamponade was used. RESULTS: Best-corrected spectacle visual acuity, refractive error, graft status, and crystalline lens clarity were measured at a minimum of 6 months postoperatively. All grafts for Fuchs dystrophy remained clear, whereas 2 grafts failed because of continued amantadine corneal toxicity. Excluding the failed grafts, the average preoperative best-corrected spectacle visual acuity was 20/47 compared with 20/28 postoperatively (P = 0.0024). There were no intraoperative complications, and no eyes developed pupillary block glaucoma or cataracts during an average follow-up interval of 9.1 months (6-14 months). CONCLUSION: DSAEK may be safely performed in the phakic eye.",M3
20334670,"Comparison of the biometric values obtained by two different A-mode ultrasound devices (Eye Cubed vs. PalmScan): a transversal, descriptive, and comparative study.BACKGROUND: To assess the reliability of the measurements obtained with the PalmScan, when compared with another standardized A-mode ultrasound device, and assess the consistency and correlation between the two methods. METHODS: Transversal, descriptive, and comparative study. We recorded the axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and <e>lens</e> thickness (LT) obtained with two A-mode ultrasounds (PalmScan A2000 and Eye Cubed) using an immersion technique. We compared the measurements with a two-sample t-test. Agreement between the two devices was assessed with Bland-Altman plots and 95% limits of agreement. RESULTS: 70 eyes of 70 patients were enrolled in this study. The measurements with the Eye Cubed of AL and ACD were shorter than the measurements taken by the PalmScan. The differences were not statistically significant regarding AL (p &lt; 0.4) but significant regarding ACD (p &lt; 0.001). The highest agreement between the two devices was obtained during LT measurement. The PalmScan measurements were shorter, but not statistically significantly (p &lt; 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: The values of AL and LT, obtained with both devices are not identical, but within the limits of agreement. The agreement is not affected by the magnitude of the ocular dimensions (but only between range of 20 mm to 27 mm of AL and 3.5 mm to 5.7 mm of LT). A correction of about 0.5 D could be considered if an intraocular lens is being calculated. However due to the large variability of the results, the authors recommend discretion in using this conversion factor, and to adjust the power of the intraocular lenses based upon the personal experience of the surgeon.",M3
20230820,"Iron, the retina and the <e>lens</e>: a focused review.This review is focused on iron metabolism in the retina and in the lens and its relation to their respective age-related pathologies, macular degeneration (AMD) and cataract (ARC). Several aspects of iron homeostasis are considered first in the retina and second in the lens, paying particular attention to the transport of iron through the blood-retinal barrier and through the lens epithelial cell barrier, to the immunochemistry of iron-related proteins and their expression in both the retina and the lens, and to the nature of the photochemical damage caused by UV light on both tissues. A comparative overview of some iron related parameters (total iron, transferrin (Tf), transferrin saturation and total iron binding capacity), in plasma and ocular tissues and fluids of three animal species is also presented. Based on results selected from the literature reviewed, and our own results, a scheme for the overall circulation of iron within and out of the eye is proposed, in which, (i) iron is pumped from the retina to the vitreous body by a ferroportin/ferroxidase-mediated process at the endfeet of Müller cells, (ii) vitreal Tf binds this iron and the complex diffuses towards the lens, (iii) the iron/Tf complex is incorporated into the lens extracellular space probably at the lens equator and moves to the epithelial-fiber interface, (iv) upon interaction with Tf receptors of the apical pole of lens epithelial cells, the iron/Tf complex is endocytosed and iron is exported as Fe(3+) by a ferroportin/ferroxidase-mediated process taking place at the basal pole of the epithelial cells, and (v) Fe(3+) is bound to aqueous humor Tf and drained with the aqueous humor into systemic blood circulation for recycling. The proposed scheme represents an example of close cooperation between the retina and the lens to maintain a constant flow of iron within the eye that provides an adequate supply of iron to ocular tissues and secures the systemic recycling of this element. It does not discount the existence of additional ways for iron to leave the eye through the blood-retinal barrier. In this review both AMD and ARC are recognized as multifactorial diseases with an important photoxidative component, and exhibiting a remarkable similitude of altered local iron metabolism. The epidemiological relationship between ARC and ferropenic anemia is explained on the basis that hepcidin, the hormone responsible for the anemia of chronic inflammation, could paradoxically cause intracellular iron overload in the lens by interfering with the proposed ferroportin/ferroxidase-mediated export of iron at the basal side of the anterior lens epithelium. Other authors have suggested that a similar situation is created in the retina in the case of AMD.",M3

20216939,"Expression of transcription factors and crystallin proteins during rat <e>lens</e> regeneration.PURPOSE: To establish a model of lens regeneration in rats and to detect the expression of transcription factor and crystallin genes. METHODS: An extracapsular lens extraction (ECLE) was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats. Examinations with slit-lamp and histological analysis were performed at various time points after ECLE. Real-time PCR and/or immunofluorescence were performed to detect the expression of the lens transcription factors paired box 6 (Pax6), prospero homeobox 1 (Prox1), and forkhead box E3 (Foxe3) and alpha-, beta-, and gamma-crystallin (Cryaa, Cryab, Crybb1, Crybb2, Cryba2, and Crygd, respectively). RESULTS: Lens epithelial cells (LECs) were left behind under the anterior capsule immediately after ECLE. Lens fiber differentiation had occurred in the peripheral capsular bag in all rats 3 days after ECLE. One month after surgery, all capsular bags were filled with new semitransparent lenticular structures displaying an established equator with well differentiated bow regions. The mRNA-expression quantity of lens transcription factors and alpha-, beta-, and gamma- crystallin increased after ECLE. Pax6 was expressed in both LECs and the newly regenerated lens fiber cells, Prox1 was expressed both in LECs and differentiating lens fiber cells, and Foxe3 was confined to LECs. CONCLUSIONS: Lens fiber differentiation during regeneration follows a process similar to embryological development, with proliferation of epithelial cells along the anterior and posterior capsule, elongation of the posterior epithelial cells, and differentiation of epithelial cells into lens fibers. The regenerated lens contains proteins and transcription factors similar to those found in normal lenses. Inductive interactions seen during lens development are not necessary for lens regeneration.",M3
20215346,"Sprouty2-modulated Kras signaling rescues Shp2 deficiency during <e>lens</e> and lacrimal gland development.Shp2/Ptpn11 tyrosine phosphatase is a general regulator of the RTK pathways. By genetic ablation, we demonstrate that Shp2 is required for lacrimal gland budding, lens cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Shp2 deletion disrupted ERK signaling and cell cycle regulation, which could be partially compensated by activated Kras signaling, confirming that Ras signaling was the main downstream target of Shp2 in lens and lacrimal gland development. We also showed that Sprouty2, a general suppressor of Ras signaling, was regulated by Shp2 positively at the transcriptional level and negatively at the post-translational level. Only in the absence of Sprouty2 could activated Kras signaling robustly rescue the lens proliferation and lacrimal-gland-budding defects in the Shp2 mutants. We propose that the dynamic regulation of Sprouty by Shp2 might be important not only for modulating Ras signaling in lens and lacrimal gland development, but also for RTK signaling in general.",M3
20207006,"Success rates of retinal buckling surgery: relationship to refractive error and <e>lens</e> status: results from a large German case series.OBJECTIVE: First, to evaluate the anatomic success rates of scleral buckling surgery in the treatment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and possible differences in outcome depending on patients' refractive error and lens status. Second, to evaluate demographic characteristics of patients with retinal detachment to contribute to our knowledge of the epidemiology of this important and sight-threatening disease. DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: The Munster Study on Therapy Achievements in Retinal Detachment (MUSTARD) is one of the largest case series of patients with retinal detachment and their outcome after buckling surgery ever established, with 4325 subjects who underwent surgery between 1980 and 2001. METHODS: All 4325 patients with retinal detachment underwent scleral buckling surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complete anatomic attachment of the retina. RESULTS: The overall success rate in all 4325 MUSTARD cases was 83.98%. The highest success rate was achieved in patients aged 51 to 60 years, with 86.72%. With regard to refractive error, success rates were highest in moderate myopes, that is, in 707 patients with a refractive error between -2.75 and -8.0 diopters (86.70%) and in 573 patients with mild myopia between -0.5 and -2.0 diopters (86.21%). The lens status did not play a significant role in outcome. In patients with nontrauma-related retinal detachment, success rates were 84.45% for phakic patients, 82.88% for pseudophakic patients, and 81.88% for aphakic patients. An epidemiologically surprising result was the lower than expected number of myopic individuals among patients with retinal detachment: Only approximately one quarter had myopia of -2.75 diopters or more. In phakic patients aged 51 to 80 years, only 16% were myopic. CONCLUSIONS: Scleral buckling is an established and generally successful method for the treatment of retinal detachment. As our case series has demonstrated, myopia, aphakia, and pseudophakia do not constitute factors that might diminish the chances of success.

20195820,"Anthraquinones from the roots of Knoxia valerianoides inhibit the formation of advanced glycation end products and rat <e>lens</e> aldose reductase in vitro.Eight known compounds, lucidin (1), lucidin-omega-methyl ether (2), rubiadin (3), damnacanthol (4), 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-methoxymethylanthraquinone (5), 3,6-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone (6), 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone 3-O-beta-primeveroside (7), and vanillic acid (8), were isolated from EtOAc- and n-BuOH-soluble fractions of the roots of Knoxia valerianoides. The structures of 1-8 were identified by analysis of spectroscopic data as well as by comparison with published values. All the isolates were subjected to in vitro bioassays to evaluate advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formation and rat lens aldose reductase (RLAR) inhibitory activity. Compound 5 showed the most potent inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 52.72 microM) against AGEs formation. Compounds 1, 2, and 8 also showed potent inhibitory activity on AGEs formation with IC(50) values of 79.28, 62.79, and 93.93 microM, respectively, compared with positive control, aminoguanidine (IC(50) = 962 microM).

20182557,"Identification of in vivo phosphorylation sites of <e>lens</e> proteins from porcine eye lenses by a gel-free phosphoproteomics approach.PURPOSE: Phosphorylation is an important post-translational modification for the cellular regulation of various biosignaling pathways. We have identified in vivo phosphorylation sites of various lens proteins including especially the major structural proteins of the crystallin family from porcine eye lenses by means of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) or immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). METHODS: For the identification of phosphorylated residues in various lens proteins of porcine lens extracts, we have adapted two complementary proteomic approaches, i.e., pre-fractionation of protein samples with 2-DE or enrichment of phosphopeptides with IMAC followed by LC-MS/MS analysis and database search. The results were compared and validated with those in phosphoproteomics databases. RESULTS: Two subunits of alpha-crystallin, alphaA-crystallin and alphaB-crystallin, as well as other lens crystallins and non-crystallin cellular proteins, such as beta-enolase, heat shock protein beta-1 (HSP27), and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) were found to be phosphorylated in vivo at specific sites. Moreover, alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins were found to be the most abundantly phosphorylated proteins in porcine lenses, being extensively phosphorylated on serine or threonine, but not on tyrosine residues. CONCLUSIONS: The complementary gel-based and gel-free proteomic strategies have been compared and evaluated for the study of crystallin phosphorylation from whole tissue extracts of porcine eye lenses. Technically, the IMAC method facilitates direct site-specific identification of phosphorylation residues in lens proteins, which does not necessitate the pre-MS/MS 2-DE separation of protein samples. Moreover, the improved strategy using gel-free phosphoproteomics analysis affords a more effective and simplistic method for the determination of in vivo phosphorylation sites than the conventional 2-DE pre-separation of protein mixture. This study should form a firm basis for the comprehensive analysis of post-translational modification of lens proteins in terms of aging or various diseased states.",M3
20167250,"Small-angle X-ray scattering studies of the intact eye <e>lens</e>: effect of crystallin composition and concentration on microstructure.BACKGROUND: The cortex and nucleus of eye lenses are differentiated by both crystallin protein concentration and relative distribution of three major crystallins (alpha, beta, and gamma). Here, we explore the effects of composition and concentration of crystallins on the microstructure of the intact bovine lens (37 degrees C) along with several lenses from Antarctic fish (-2 degrees C) and subtropical bigeye tuna (18 degrees C). METHODS: Our studies are based on small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) investigations of the intact lens slices where we study the effect of crystallin composition and concentration on microstructure. RESULTS: We are able to distinguish the nuclear and cortical regions by the development of a characteristic peak in the intensity of scattered X-rays. For both the bovine and fish lenses, the peak corresponds to that expected for dense suspensions of alpha-crystallins. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of the scattering peak in the nucleus indicates that there is no characteristic wavelength for density fluctuations in the nucleus although there is liquid-like order in the packing of the different crystallins. The loss in peak is due to increased polydispersity in the sizes of the crystallins and due to the packing of the smaller gamma-crystallins in the void space of alpha-crystallins. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide an understanding for the low turbidity of the eye lens that is a mixture of different proteins. This will inform design of optically transparent suspensions that can be used in a number of applications (e.g., artificial liquid lenses) or to better understand human diseases pathologies such as cataract.",M3
20163862,"Vaulting of myopic and toric Implantable Collamer Lenses during accommodation measured with Visante optical coherence tomography.PURPOSE: To study changes in vaulting of myopic and toric Implantable Collamer Lenses (ICLs) version 4 during accommodation with Visante optical coherence tomography (OCT), and analyze the relationship between vaulting and anterior subcapsular opacification. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-seven eyes of 77 myopic patients were examined after implantation with an ICL (48 myopic, 29 toric). The median follow-up time was 63 months (range, 10-84). METHODS: The distance between the posterior ICL surface and the anterior surface of the crystalline <e>lens</e> was measured in the nonaccommodative state and during accommodation with Visante OCT. The lenses were examined for opacification using slit-lamp microscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The distance between the ICL and the anterior surface of the crystalline lens. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean distance between the ICL and the crystalline lens was 0.31+/-0.19 mm and during accommodation 0.31+/-0.26 mm; the difference did not reach significance (P = 0.77). The distance at baseline was significantly (P = 0.01) less in older patients and significantly (P = 0.04) greater in patients with a toric ICL. Contact was observed at baseline or during accommodation in 12 eyes; there was a significantly lower incidence of contact in eyes implanted with a toric ICL (P = 0.03). Anterior subcapsular opacification developed in 10 eyes, in 5 of these the ICL touched the crystalline lens. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior subcapsular opacification developed in 13.0% of eyes. We found no difference in vaulting of the ICL at baseline and during accommodation. There was contact between the ICL and the crystalline lens in 15.6% of the eyes. The association between anterior subcapsular opacification and contact was significant (P = 0.004).",M3
20152615,"Age-related changes in the transmission properties of the human <e>lens</e> and their relevance to circadian entrainment.PURPOSE: To characterize age-related changes in the transmission of light through noncataractous human lenses. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Glostrup Hospital, Glostrup, Denmark. METHODS: The spectral transmission of white light was measured along the visual axis in the most central part of the lens in vitro in intact human donor lenses over a wide range of ages. RESULTS: The study evaluated 28 intact human donor lenses of 15 donors aged 18 to 76 years. Increasing age was associated with gradually decreasing transmission at all visible wavelengths, most prominently at shorter wavelengths. Empirical formulas describing the age-related loss of transmission were created for each spectral color. At 480 nm, the absorption peak for melanopsin, transmission decreased by 72% from the age of 10 years to the age of 80 years. CONCLUSION: The age-related decrease in spectral transmission through the human lens could be modeled by a simple algorithm that may be useful in the design of intraocular lenses that mimic the characteristics of the human lens and in studies of color vision, psychophysics, and melanopsin activation.",M3
20152613,"Uveal and capsular biocompatibility of an intraocular <e>lens</e> with a hydrophilic anterior surface and a hydrophobic posterior surface.PURPOSE: To evaluate the uveal and capsular biocompatibility of intraocular lenses (IOLs) with a hydrophilic anterior surface and a hydrophobic posterior surface in a rabbit model. SETTING: Eye Center, Affiliated Second Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. METHODS: Modified silicone IOLs were produced by grafting 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) onto the anterior IOL surface using a plasma technique. A contact-angle test characterized the hydrophilicity of the IOL surface; physical and optical properties were determined by State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) standards. Rabbits had phacomulsification and implantation a modified silicone IOL, a control silicone IOL, or a hydrogel IOL. Postoperative inflammation was assessed by aqueous flare measurement, and PCO was evaluated by software analysis. Three months after surgery, attached cells on extracted IOLs were evaluated by light microscopy; PCO was evaluated by Miyake-Apple technique. Histologic sections of globes were used to assess lens epithelial cells (LECs) and extracellular matrix in the capsular bag. RESULTS: Contact angle data showed the MPC-modified IOL had a hydrophilic anterior surface and hydrophobic posterior surface. The properties of the modified IOLs met SFDA standards. There was no statistical difference in aqueous flare between the IOL groups at any time. The modified and control IOLs had less PCO than the hydrogel IOLs (P&lt;.05). There were fewer cells on modified IOLs than on silicone IOLs (P&lt;.05). The LECs and cortical remnants on modified IOLs had a rapid, fibroblastic appearance at the optic periphery; the center was clear. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the MPC-modified IOL has excellent uveal and capsule biocompatibility from hydrophilic anterior surface and hydrophobic posterior surface properties, respectively.",M3
20152603,"Magnetic resonance imaging of the anteroposterior position and thickness of the aging, accommodating, phakic, and pseudophakic ciliary muscle.PURPOSE: To quantify accommodative and age-related changes in the anteroposterior position and thickness of the ciliary muscle in phakic and pseudophakic eyes. SETTING: Department of Surgery/Bioengineering, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway; Institute of Ophthalmology and Visual Science UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey; MRI Research, Inc., Middleburg Heights, Ohio, USA. METHODS: Magnetic resonance images were taken of phakic and pseudophakic eyes. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 32 phakic volunteers and 8 volunteers with a monocular intraocular <e>lens</e> (IOL) aged 22 to 91 years. No anteroposterior accommodative movement of the ciliary muscle apex occurred in either group. The muscle moved closer to the cornea with advancing age in phakic eyes; IOL implantation returned the muscle to a youthful position. An age-dependent increase in ciliary muscle anteroposterior thickness occurred that was not mitigated by IOL implantation. Muscle thickness increased with accommodation in only phakic eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Presbyopia-correction strategies cannot rely on accommodative anterior movement of the ciliary muscle. Forces on the uvea by crystalline lens-pupillary margin contact may increase with accommodation and lens growth, producing accommodative and age-dependent increases in muscle thickness and significant age-dependent anterior muscle displacement. Intraocular lens implantation removed these forces, allowing choroidal elasticity to restore the muscle to a youthful position; however, the increase in thickness was permanent and likely due to an age-dependent increase in connective tissue. This supports the geometric theory of presbyopia development and that the mechanical forces in human accommodation and presbyopia are very different from those in the rhesus monkey model.",M3
20152599,"Role of anterior capsule polishing in residual <e>lens</e> epithelial cell proliferation.PURPOSE: To determine the role of anterior capsule polishing in residual lens epithelial cell (LEC) proliferation. SETTING: Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. METHODS: Phacoemulsification was performed on pairs of human cadaver eyes. One eye of each pair had anterior capsule polishing; the fellow eye did not. Capsular bags with implanted intraocular lenses (IOLs) were incubated in culture. Specimens were observed and photographed under microscopy. For clinical comparison, both eyes of patients who had phacoemulsification and IOL implantation with anterior capsule polishing in 1 eye only were observed for 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS: The study comprised 10 pairs of cadaver eyes and 20 eyes of 10 patients. One day after surgery, large patches of cells remained under the anterior capsule and the equatorial zone in the unpolished cadaver eyes and the anterior capsule was clear in the polished eyes. By 3 days in culture, many patches of dead cells had formed in the unpolished eyes. After 7 days in culture, cell growth was minimal in the unpolished eyes; however, robust cell proliferation was observed in the polished eyes. In the clinical comparison, there was no obvious difference in the mean subjectively assessed fibrotic posterior capsule opacification (PCO) score between polished eyes and unpolished eyes at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior capsule polishing, although it removed many LECs, did not decrease residual cell growth and, conversely, enhanced cell proliferation in capsular bag cultures. This might explain why polishing does not reduce PCO in clinical studies.",M3
20148663,"Prevention of oxidative damage to <e>lens</e> by caffeine.PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to examine the possibility of inhibiting oxidative damage to the lens in vitro by caffeine. METHODS: Oxidative damage was inflicted by incubating mouse lenses in Tyrode medium containing 0.1 mM Fe(8)Br(8), an iron complex soluble in aqueous medium. Parallel incubations were conducted in the presence of caffeine (5 mM). RESULTS: Lenses incubated in the medium containing Fe(8)Br(8) undergo oxidative stress, as evidenced by the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+) ATPase-driven rubidium transport and the loss of tissue glutathione and ATP. These effects were prevented in presence of caffeine. That the effects are due to the oxyradicals produced was ascertained further by parallel studies with Tempol (5 mM), a well-known scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with its activity being more pronounced with hydroxyl radicals as compared to other ROS. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine was found to be effective in preventing oxidative stress to the lens induced by iron under ambient conditions. The protective effect is attributable to its ability to scavenge ROS, particularly the hydroxyl radical.",M3
20142845,"Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging of crystalline <e>lens</e> dimensions in chicken.PURPOSE: A reduction in the power of the crystalline lens during childhood is thought to be important in the emmetropization of the maturing eye. However, in humans and model organisms, little is known about the factors that determine the dimensions of the crystalline lens and in particular whether these different parameters (axial thickness, surface curvatures, equatorial diameter, and volume) are under a common source of control or regulated independently of other aspects of eye size and shape. METHODS: Using chickens from a broiler-layer experimental cross as a model system, three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained at 115-microm isotropic resolution for one eye of 501 individuals aged 3-weeks old. After fixation with paraformaldehyde, the excised eyes were scanned overnight (16 h) in groups of 16 arranged in a 2x2x4 array. Lens dimensions were calculated from each image by fitting a three-dimensional mesh model to the lens, using the semi-automated analysis program mri3dX. The lens dimensions were compared to measures of eye and body size obtained in vivo using techniques that included keratometry and A-scan ultrasonography. RESULTS: A striking finding was that axial lens thickness measured using ex vivo MRI was only weakly correlated with lens thickness measured in vivo by ultrasonography (r=0.19, p&lt;0.001). In addition, the MRI lens thickness estimates had a lower mean value and much higher variance. Indeed, about one-third of crystalline lenses showed a kidney-shaped appearance instead of the typical biconvex shape. Since repeat MRI scans of the same eye showed a high degree of reproducibility for the scanning and mri3dX analysis steps (the correlation in repeat lens thickness measurements was r=0.95, p&lt;0.001) and a recent report has shown that paraformaldehyde fixation induces a loss of water from the human crystalline lens, it is likely that the tissue fixation step caused a variable degree of shrinkage and a change in shape to the lenses examined here. Despite this serious source of imprecision, we found significant correlations between lens volume and eye/body size (p&lt;0.001) and between lens equatorial diameter and eye/body size (p&lt;0.001) in these chickens. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that certain aspects of lens size (specifically, lens volume and equatorial diameter) are controlled by factors that also regulate the size of the eye and body (presumably, predominantly genetic factors). However, since it has been shown previously that axial lens thickness is regulated almost independently of eye and body size, these results suggest that different systems might operate to control lens volume/diameter and lens thickness in normal chickens.",M3

It is most often associated with systemic diseases such as Marfan syndrome, Weill-Marchesani syndrome or homocystinuria. Isolated non syndromic ectopia lentis (IEL) is reported in families with autosomal inheritance, with dominant forms being more common than recessive. LTBP2 truncating mutations have been described as a cause of autosomal recessive ectopia lentis as a primary or secondary feature in patients showing ocular (eg, glaucoma) or extraocular manifestations (eg, Marfanoid habitus). Recently, ADAMTSL4 has been shown to be responsible for isolated autosomal recessive ectopia lentis in an inbred family. Herein we show a consanguineous family that carries a novel homozygous splice mutation IVS4-1G&gt;A/IVS4-1G&gt;A in ADAMTSL4 responsible for isolated autosomal recessive EL, thus confirming the involvement of this gene in this condition and underlining the major role of ADAMTS proteases in zonular fibers homeostasis.",M3
20136422,"Effect of curcumin on selenite-induced cataractogenesis in Wistar rat pups.PURPOSE: The present study was aimed at investigating the possible antioxidant potential of curcumin at a dose of 75 mg/kg body weight on selenite-induced cataract in experimental rat pups. METHODS: Group I: Control rat pups receiving physiological saline; Group II: Selenite-induced group (15 microM/kg body wt); Group III: Selenite-induced group co-treated with curcumin (single dose of curcumin orally 75 mg/kg body wt); Group IV: Selenite-induced animals post-treated (after 24 hrs) with curcumin at a dose mentioned for group III; Group V: Rat pups were pretreated with curcumin (dose as mentioned in Group III), 24 hrs before the administration of selenite. Encapsulated lenses liver, kidney, and serum were analyzed for antioxidant enzymes and malondialdehyde, a marker of lipid peroxidation. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal injection of sodium selenite (15 microM/kg body wt) to 8-10-day-old rat pups led to severe oxidative stress in eye <e>lens</e> as evidenced by enhanced LPO levels that led to cataract formation. Sodium selenite also led to decrease in activities of SOD, GST, GPx, CAT with simultaneous decrease in the levels of GSH, vitamin C, and vitamin E. Treatment with curcumin (75 mg/kg body wt) led to a significant decrease in the levels of LPO, enzymic antioxidants, and nonenzymic antioxidants, which were similar to that of control. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin suppressed selenite-induced oxidative stress and cataract formation in rat pups. The presence of oxidative stress in selenite cataract development and its prevention by curcumin support the possibility that the natural consumption of curcumin in food can help prevent the onset of senile cataract.",M3
20136419,"Broccoli regulates protein alterations and cataractogenesis in selenite models.PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of Brassica oleracea var. italica (Broccoli) in the prevention of selenite induced biochemical changes and the incidence of cataractogenesis in vivo. METHODS: Eight day old Sprague-Dawley rat pups were divided into four groups: I-Control; II-Sodium selenite (4 mg/kg body weight) administered; III-Sodium selenite + quercetin; and IV-Sodium selenite + flavonoid fraction of broccoli (FFB). Treatment groups III and IV received quercetin and FFB intraperitoneally from 8th to 15th day at a concentration (2.0 mg/kg body weight). The development of cataract was assessed and graded by slit-lamp examination. Some relevant biochemical parameters-such as activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, Ca(2+)ATPase, calpains, concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH), levels of calcium, lipid peroxidation product-thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) and SDS-PAGE analysis of <e>lens</e> water soluble proteins (WSF) were analyzed. RESULTS: FFB modulates selenite-induced biochemical changes in albino rats. Lenses of Group I rats were clear but in Group II, all lenses developed dense opacification (grade 5 and 6), whereas mild opacifications were observed in Group III and Group IV (grade 2). Group III and Group IV lenses exhibited significantly higher values of antioxidant enzymes, Ca(2+)ATPase, and GSH, whereas lower values were obtained for TBARS, calcium, and calpains compared to Group II. Lens protein profile of water soluble proteins showed normal levels of Group III and Group IV compared to Group II lenses. CONCLUSION: FFB prevents selenite-induced cataractogenesis in albino rat pups, possibly by maintaining antioxidant status and ionic balance through Ca(2+) ATPase pump, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, calpain activation, and protein insolubilization, which have been reported in this article for the first time.",M3
20131056,"Temporal properties of the <e>lens</e> eyes of the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora.Box jellyfish (Cubomedusae) are visually orientating animals which possess a total of 24 eyes of 4 morphological types; 2 pigment cup eyes (pit eye and slit eye) and 2 lens eyes [upper lens-eye (ule) and lower lens-eye (lle)]. In this study, we use electroretinograms (ERGs) to explore temporal properties of the two lens eyes. We find that the ERG of both lens eyes are complex and using sinusoidal flicker stimuli we find that both lens eyes have slow temporal resolution. The average flicker fusion frequency (FFF) was found to be approximately 10 Hz for the ule and 8 Hz for the lle. Differences in the FFF and response patterns between the two lens eyes suggest that the ule and lle filter information differently in the temporal domain and thus are tuned to perform different visual tasks. The data collected in this study support the idea that the visual system of box jellyfish is a collection of special purpose eyes.",M3
20122897,"Temperature-induced structural transition in-situ in porcine <e>lens</e>--changes observed in void size distribution.The function of mammalian ocular lens is to provide a sharp image to the retina. Accordingly, the lens needs to be transparent and minimize light scattering. To do so the lens fiber cells first loose intracellular organelles, organize the cytoplasm and arrange the fiber cell membranes. Because the fiber cells are metabolically inactive, the plasma membrane becomes the only cellular organelle and consequently, the phase behavior of these membranes determines the physiological state of the lens. Previous studies have shown that lipids extracted from the nuclear and cortical region of human lens show a temperature-induced phase transition close to the body temperature. Yet, the physiological function of this phase transition is not known, and even the presence of the phase transition in intact lenses is unknown. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) was used to characterize the sub-nanometer-sized local structure of intact porcine lens and these studies were complemented with differential scanning calorimeter and mass spectrometric analysis in extracted porcine lens lipids. Using PALS, we present evidence for the presence of a temperature-dependent structural transition centered at 35.5 degrees C in-situ in clear extracted porcine lenses. Further studies employing extracted lens lipids and purified egg-yolk sphingomyelin and cholesterol mixtures suggest that the nano-scale transition emerges from the phase behavior of lens lipids. Based on our results, PALS seems to be a viable method for gaining additional information on biological tissues, especially since it enables non-destructive studies on intact tissues.",M3
20117701,"Comparison of visual function between phakic eyes and pseudophakic eyes with a monofocal intraocular <e>lens</e>.PURPOSE: To compare all-distance visual acuity and contrast visual acuity with and without glare (glare visual acuity) between phakic eyes with a clear lens and pseudophakic eyes with a monofocal intraocular lens. SETTING: Hayashi Eye Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan. METHODS: This study comprised phakic), pseudophakic eyes in 4 age groups (40s, 50s, 60s, 70s). Corrected visual acuity from far to near, contrast visual acuity, and glare visual acuity were examined. RESULTS: The mean corrected intermediate and near visual acuities were significantly better in phakic eyes than in pseudophakic eyes in patients in their 40s and 50s (P&lt;or=.0215); corrected distance visual acuity was similar. In the 60s and 70s age groups, there was no statistically significant difference in corrected visual acuity at any distance. The region of accommodation at which eyes achieved a corrected visual acuity of 20/29 or 20/40 was greater in phakic eyes than in pseudophakic eyes in the 40s and 50s age groups (P&lt;or=.0302) but was similar in 60s and 70s age groups. In all age groups, there were no significant differences in photopic or mesopic contrast visual acuity or glare visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: In patients in their 40s and 50s, the region of accommodation in phakic eyes was greater than in pseudophakic eyes; the region was similar in patients in their 60s and 70s. Because contrast sensitivity with and without glare was similar at all ages, visual function appeared to be comparable in patients 60 years and older.",M3
20117205,"The zebrafish mutant bumper shows a hyperproliferation of <e>lens</e> epithelial cells and fibre cell degeneration leading to functional blindness.The development of the eye lens is one of the classical paradigms of induction during embryonic development in vertebrates. But while there have been numerous studies aimed at discovering the genetic networks controlling early lens development, comparatively little is known about later stages, including the differentiation of secondary lens fibre cells. The analysis of mutant zebrafish isolated in forward genetic screens is an important way to investigate the roles of genes in embryogenesis. In this study we describe the zebrafish mutant bumper (bum), which shows a transient, tumour-like hyperproliferation of the lens epithelium as well as a progressively stronger defect in secondary fibre cell differentiation, which results in a significantly reduced lens size and ectopic location of the lens within the neural retina. Interestingly, the initial hyperproliferation of the lens epithelium in bum spontaneously regresses, suggesting this mutant as a valuable model to study the molecular control of tumour progression/suppression. Behavioural analyses demonstrate that, despite a morphologically normal retina, larval and adult bum(-/-) zebrafish are functionally blind. We further show that these fish have defects in their craniofacial skeleton with normal but delayed formation of the scleral ossicles within the eye, several reduced craniofacial bones resulting in an abnormal skull shape, and asymmetric ectopic bone formation within the mandible. Genetic mapping located the mutation in bum to a 4cM interval on chromosome 7 with the closest markers located at 0.2 and 0cM, respectively.",M3
20108193,"[fs-Lentotomy: presbyopia reversal by generating gliding planes inside the crystalline <e>lens</e>]Based on the Helmholtz theory for accommodation, increasing sclerosis of the lens nucleus and cortex is the main cause for the development of presbyopia. Existing therapies, however, do not reverse the stiffness of the crystalline lens and thus do not regain real accommodation ability. A new approach to restore the flexibility of the lens has been realised by utilising the non-linear interaction of ultrafast laser pulses with transparent tissue, the so-called photodisruption. This process has been used to create micro-incisions which act as gliding planes inside the crystalline lens without opening the eye globe. This treatment method, known as fs-lentotomy, enables regeneration of real dynamic accommodation. For the first time, 3D structures for gliding planes were successfully generated in experiments with human donor lenses of different ages. An average increase in anterior-posterior lens thickness of 100 mum accompanied by a decrease of equatorial lens diameter was observed as a direct consequence of fs-lentotomy. This is attributed to the increased flexibility, as the force of the capsule bag moulds the lens tissue more spherically. Moreover, in vivo experiments on rabbit eye lenses did not induce an increasing opacification (cataract) over a six-month follow-up period. However, the incisions were still detectable using Scheimpflug imaging and histopathological techniques, although the visibility of the incisions was declining. Furthermore, no side effects were observed during the wound healing process and during a six-months follow-up period. Based on these findings fs-lentotomy might have the potential to become a procedure for the reversal of presbyopia.",M3
20107174,"Refractive power and biometric properties of the nonhuman primate isolated crystalline <e>lens</e>.Purpose. To characterize the age dependence of shape, refractive power, and refractive index of isolated lenses from nonhuman primates. Methods. Measurements were performed on ex vivo lenses from cynomolgus monkeys (cyno: n = 120; age, 2.7-14.3 years), rhesus monkeys (n = 61; age, 0.7-13.3 years), and hamadryas baboons (baboon: n = 16; age, 1.7-27.3 years). Lens thickness, diameter, and surface curvatures were measured with an optical comparator. Lens refractive power was measured with a custom optical system based on the Scheiner principle. The refractive contributions of the gradient, the surfaces, and the equivalent refractive index were calculated with optical ray-tracing software. The age dependence of the optical and biometric parameters was assessed. Results. Over the measured age range isolated lens thickness decreased (baboon: -0.04, cyno: -0.05, and rhesus: -0.06 mm/y) and equatorial diameter increased (logarithmically for the baboon and rhesus, and linearly for cyno: 0.07 mm/y). The isolated lens surfaces flattened and the corresponding refractive power from the surfaces decreased with age (-0.33, -0.48, and -0.68 D/y). The isolated lens equivalent refractive index decreased (only significant for the baboon, -0.001 D/y), and as a result the total isolated lens refractive power decreased with age (baboon: -1.26, cyno: -0.97, and rhesus: -1.76 D/y). Conclusions. The age-dependent trends in the optical and biometric properties, growth, and aging, of nonhuman primate lenses are similar to those of the pre-presbyopic human lens. As the lens ages, the decrease in refractive contributions from the gradient refractive index causes a rapid age-dependent decrease in maximally accommodated lens refractive power.",M3
20105280,"Activated Ras alters <e>lens</e> and corneal development through induction of distinct downstream targets.BACKGROUND: Mammalian Ras genes regulate diverse cellular processes including proliferation and differentiation and are frequently mutated in human cancers. Tumor development in response to Ras activation varies between different tissues and the molecular basis for these variations are poorly understood. The murine lens and cornea have a common embryonic origin and arise from adjacent regions of the surface ectoderm. Activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway induces the corneal epithelial cells to proliferate and the lens epithelial cells to exit the cell cycle. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the differential responses of these two related tissues have not been defined. We have generated transgenic mice that express a constitutively active version of human H-Ras in their lenses and corneas. RESULTS: Ras transgenic lenses and corneal epithelial cells showed increased proliferation with concomitant increases in cyclin D1 and D2 expression. This initial increase in proliferation is sustained in the cornea but not in the lens epithelial cells. Coincidentally, cdk inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 were upregulated in the Ras transgenic lenses but not in the corneas. Phospho-Erk1 and Erk2 levels were elevated in the lens but not in the cornea and Spry 1 and Spry 2, negative regulators of Ras-Raf-Erk signaling, were upregulated more in the corneal than in the lens epithelial cells. Both lens and corneal differentiation programs were sensitive to Ras activation. Ras transgenic embryos showed a distinctive alteration in the architecture of the lens pit. Ras activation, though sufficient for upregulation of Prox1, a transcription factor critical for cell cycle exit and initiation of fiber differentiation, is not sufficient for induction of terminal fiber differentiation. Expression of Keratin 12, a marker of corneal epithelial differentiation, was reduced in the Ras transgenic corneas. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that Ras activation a) induces distinct sets of downstream targets in the lens and cornea resulting in distinct cellular responses and b) is sufficient for initiation but not completion of lens fiber differentiation.",M3
20104256,"Global gene expression analysis of lenses from different mouse strains and in the alpha3Cx46 knockout mouse.PURPOSE: Disruption of the mouse gene encoding the gap junction subunit alpha3 connexin 46 (alpha3Cx46) results in the formation of <e>lens</e> cataracts that have a severity affected by the genetic background of the mouse strain. To identify the genes that influence the severity of the nuclear opacity, global gene expression was analyzed in lenses from the 129SvJae strain and compared to the C57BL/6J strain. METHODS: Lens transcripts were subjected to cDNA microarray analysis. Results on selected genes were confirmed by real-time PCR. RESULTS: GENES THAT WERE DETERMINED TO BE ALTERED IN EXPRESSION LEVELS AS A RESULT OF STRAIN DIFFERENCES COULD BE CLUSTERED INTO THREE GROUPS: energy metabolism, stress response, and cell growth. CONCLUSIONS: There were no observed changes in gene expression as a result of the lack of alpha3Cx46 in the different mouse strains, suggesting that the pathways mediated by this connexin do not influence gene transcription in the lens. Analysis of the transcript changes due to strain differences provides new insights into potential genetic modifiers of cataractogenesis. More detailed experimentation will be needed to determine if these observed changes do indeed affect cataractogenesis.",M3
20104255,"Down regulation of the PEDF gene in human <e>lens</e> epithelium cells changed the expression of proteins vimentin and alphaB-crystallin.PURPOSE: To study the relationship of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) expression with the expression of vimentin and alphaB-crystallin by lens epithelial cells. METHODS: Lens epithelial cells adhering to anterior capsules taken from young donor eyes aged from 20 to 35 years were cultured and passaged. We designed small interfering RNA (siRNA) constructs to specifically downregulate the expression of PEDF by these primary lens epithelial cells. Quantitative PCR was used to confirm the downregulation of PEDF RNA expression following infection of lens epithelial cells. To determine whether altering the expression of PEDF would effect the expression of vimentin or alphaB-crystallin, we performed western blotting 48 h after expression of the PEDF-directed siRNA. RESULTS: PEDF RNA expression in the human lens epithelial cells was strongly downregulated by the three separate siRNA constructs. Western blotting revealed that the downregulation of PEDF expression resulted in a concomitant decrease in expression of vimentin and an increase in alphaB-crystallin protein. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased expression of PEDF in primary human lens epithelial cells resulted in a decrease in the expression of vimentin and the increase of alphaB-crystallin expression, two proteins critical for maintaining lens clarity.",M3

The purpose of this research is to obtain sequence resources for a newt lens regeneration study and to obtain insights of dedifferentiation at the molecular level. METHODS: mRNA was purified from iris during dedifferentiation and its cDNA library was constructed. From the cDNA library 10,449 clones were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: From 10,449 reads, 780 contigs and 1,666 singlets were annotated. The presence of several cancer- and apoptosis-related genes during newt dedifferentiation was revealed. Moreover, several candidate genes, which might participate in reprogramming during dedifferentiation, were also found. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of cancer- and apoptosis-related genes could be hallmarks during dedifferentiation. The expression sequence tag (EST) resource is useful for the future study of newt dedifferentiation, and the sequence information is available in GenBank (accession numbers; FS290155-FS300559).",M3
20090208,"Mouse models of cataract.Much of our knowledge about the function of genes in cataracts has been derived from the molecular analysis of spontaneous or induced mutations in the mouse. Mutations affecting the mouse <e>lens</e> can be identified easily by visual inspection, and a remarkable number of mutant lines have been characterized. In contrast to humans, most of the genetic mouse cataract models suffer from congenital cataracts, and only a few develop cataracts in old age. Therefore, the mouse cataract models contributed rather to the understanding of lens development than to the ageing process taking place in the lens. A prerequisite for molecular analysis is the chromosomal localization of the gene. In this review, several mouse models will be discussed with emphasis on the underlying genetic basis rather than the morphological features as exemplified by the following: (i) the most frequent mutations in congenital cataracts affect genes coding for gamma-crystallins (gene symbol: Cryg); (ii) some postnatal, progressive cataracts have been characterized by mutations in the beta-crystallin encoding genes (Cryb); (iii) mutations in genes coding for membrane proteins like MIP or connexins lead to congenital cataracts; (iv) mutations in genes coding for transcription factors such as FoxE3, Maf, Sox1, and Six5 cause cataracts; (v) mouse models suffering from hereditary age-related cataracts (e.g. Emory cataract) have not yet been characterized genetically. In conclusion, a broad variety of hereditary congenital cataracts are well understood at the molecular level. Further, expression patterns of the affected genes in several other tissues and organs outside the eye, is making it increasingly clear that isolated cataracts are the exception rather than the rule. By further understanding the pleiotropic effects of these genes, we might recognize cataracts as an easily visible biomarker for a number of systemic syndromes.",M3
20086076,"<e>Lens</e> gap junctions in growth, differentiation, and homeostasis.The cells of most mammalian organs are connected by groups of cell-to-cell channels called gap junctions. Gap junction channels are made from the connexin (Cx) family of proteins. There are at least 20 isoforms of connexins, and most tissues express more than 1 isoform. The lens is no exception, as it expresses three isoforms: Cx43, Cx46, and Cx50. A common role for all gap junctions, regardless of their Cx composition, is to provide a conduit for ion flow between cells, thus creating a syncytial tissue with regard to intracellular voltage and ion concentrations. Given this rather simple role of gap junctions, a persistent question has been: Why are there so many Cx isoforms and why do tissues express more than one isoform? Recent studies of lens Cx knockout (KO) and knock in (KI) lenses have begun to answer these questions. To understand these roles, one must first understand the physiological requirements of the lens. We therefore first review the development and structure of the lens, its numerous transport systems, how these systems are integrated to generate the lens circulation, the roles of the circulation in lens homeostasis, and finally the roles of lens connexins in growth, development, and the lens circulation.",M3
20081189,"Pax6-dependent Shroom3 expression regulates apical constriction during <e>lens</e> placode invagination.Embryonic development requires a complex series of relative cellular movements and shape changes that are generally referred to as morphogenesis. Although some of the mechanisms underlying morphogenesis have been identified, the process is still poorly understood. Here, we address mechanisms of epithelial morphogenesis using the vertebrate lens as a model system. We show that the apical constriction of lens epithelial cells that accompanies invagination of the lens placode is dependent on Shroom3, a molecule previously associated with apical constriction during morphogenesis of the neural plate. We show that Shroom3 is required for the apical localization of F-actin and myosin II, both crucial components of the contractile complexes required for apical constriction, and for the apical localization of Vasp, a Mena family protein with F-actin anti-capping function that is also required for morphogenesis. Finally, we show that the expression of Shroom3 is dependent on the crucial lens-induction transcription factor Pax6. This provides a previously missing link between lens-induction pathways and the morphogenesis machinery and partly explains the absence of lens morphogenesis in Pax6-deficient mutants.",M3
20060764,"A Pex7 hypomorphic mouse model for plasmalogen deficiency affecting the <e>lens</e> and skeleton.Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 is a peroxisome biogenesis disorder with the clinical features of rhizomelia, abnormal epiphyseal calcifications, congenital cataracts, and profound growth and developmental delays. It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, caused by defects in the peroxisome receptor, PEX7. The pathology results from a deficiency of plasmalogens, a critical class of ether phospholipids whose functions are largely unknown. To study plasmalogens in an animal model, avoid early mortality and facilitate therapeutic investigations in this disease, we engineered a hypomorphic mouse model in which Pex7 transcript levels are reduced to less than 5% of wild type. These mice are born in expected ratios, are fertile and have a normal life span. However, they are petite and develop early cataracts. Further investigations showed delayed endochondral ossification and abnormalities in lens fibers. The biochemical features of reduced Pex7 function were reproduced in this model, including tissue plasmalogen deficiency, phytanic acid accumulation, reduced import of Pex7 ligands and consequent defects in plasmalogen biosynthesis and phytanic acid oxidation. Dietary supplementation with batyl alcohol, a plasmalogen precursor, recovered ether phospholipids in blood, but did not alter the clinical phenotype. The relatively mild phenotype of these mice mimics patients with milder PEX7 defects, and highlights the skeleton and lens as sensitive markers of plasmalogen deficiency. The role of plasmalogens in the normal function of these tissues at various ages can now be studied and additional therapeutic interventions tested in this model.",M3
20057910,"Hyperoxia-induced <e>lens</e> damage in rabbit: protective effects of N-acetylcysteine.PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacies of different concentrations of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in preventing hyperoxia-induced lens opacification and changes to biochemical parameters in organ-cultured rabbit lenses. METHODS: Thirty-six lenses from adult rabbits were divided into the control group (group A), the hyperoxia-exposed group (group B), and the hyperoxia-exposed, NAC-treated groups: 5 mM NAC (group C), 10 mM NAC (group D), 20 mM NAC (group E), and 40 mM NAC (group F). Groups B-F were incubated with hyperoxia (pO(2)&gt;80%) for 4 h per day for 7 d. Lens transparency, histology, and enzymatic activities were measured after incubation. RESULTS: Gross examination of these lenses revealed some severe cortical opacification in group B, and moderate cortical opacification in the lenses of groups C and D. There was minimal cortical opacification in groups A, E, and F. The activities of Na, K-ATPase, and catalase were significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower in group B (38.2%) than in group A (39.9%). It was also lower in group E and F lenses (p&lt;0.05), which had higher levels of NAC-protected enzymes. The glutathione and water-soluble protein content were significantly lower in group B lenses than in group A, E, or F lenses (p&lt;0.05). However, there was no difference between group E and F lenses (p&gt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggests that NAC (20 mM-40 mM) significantly prevented experimental lenses' hyperoxia-induced cortical opacification, indicating NAC's potential role in protecting lenses against cataracts induced by high oxygen levels.",M3

20053973,"Age-dependent deamidation of lifelong proteins in the human <e>lens</e>.PURPOSE: Deamidation is a common posttranslational modification in human lens crystallins and may be a key factor in the age-related denaturation of such lifelong proteins. The aim of this study was to identify the sites of deamidation in older lenses. METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of tryptic digests was used to identify sites of deamidation in the major human lens crystallins. Older normal and age-matched cataractous lenses were compared with fetal lenses. RESULTS: Approximately equal numbers of glutamine and asparagine residues were deamidated in older lenses; however, the extent of deamidation of Asn was three times greater than that of Gln (Asn, 22.6% +/- 3.6%; Gln, 6.6% +/- 1.3%). Individual crystallins differed markedly in their extent of deamidation, and deamidated residues were typically localized within discrete regions of the polypeptides. A large percentage (42%) of the sites of deamidation were characterized by the presence of a basic amino acid one residue removed from the original Gln or Asn. At nine such sites, the extent of Asn deamidation averaged 50% in aged lenses. There were few differences in deamidation between crystallins of aged normal and nuclear cataractous lenses. CONCLUSIONS: Equal numbers of Asn and Gln residues are deamidated in crystallins from aged normal and cataractous lenses. Deamidation of Asn/Gln in lifelong proteins, such as those in the lens, may be governed to a significant degree by base-catalyzed processes.",M3
20049853,"Ion transport in a human <e>lens</e> epithelial cell line exposed to hyposmotic and apoptotic stress.Membrane transport changes in human lens epithelial (HLE-B3) cells under hyposmotic and apoptotic stress were compared. Cell potassium content, K(i), uptake of the K congener rubidium, Rb(i), and water content were measured after hyposmotic stress induced by hypotonicity, and apoptotic stress by the protein-kinase inhibitor staurosporine (STP). Cell water increased in hyposmotic (150 mOsm) as compared to isosmotic (300 mOsm) balanced salt solution (BSS) by &gt;2-fold at 5 min and decreased within 15 min to baseline values accompanied by a 40% K(i) loss commensurate with cell swelling and subsequent cell shrinkage likely due to regulatory volume decrease (RVD). Loss of K(i), and accompanying water, and Rb(i) uptake in hyposmotic BSS were prevented by clotrimazole (CTZ) suggesting water shifts associated with K and Rb flux via intermediate conductance K (IK) channels, also detected at the mRNA and protein level. In contrast, 2 h after 2 microM STP exposure, the cells lost approximately 40% water and approximately 60% K(i), respectively, consistent with apoptotic volume decrease (AVD). Indeed, water and K(i) loss was at least fivefold greater after hyposmotic than after apoptotic stress. High extracellular K and 2 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) but not CTZ significantly reduced apoptosis. Annexin labeling phosphatidylserine (PS) at 15 min suggested loss of lipid asymmetry. Quantitative PCR revealed significant IK channel expression during prolonged hyposmotic stress. Results suggest in HLE-B3 cells, IK channels likely partook in and were down regulated after RVD, whereas pro-apoptotic STP-activation of 4-AP-sensitive voltage-gated K channels preceded or accompanied PS externalization before subsequent apoptosis.",M3
20044022,"Effect of plant-based feed ingredients on osmoregulation in the Atlantic salmon <e>lens</e>.Lenses of adult Atlantic salmon fed with a plant oil and plant protein-based diet (plant diet) were compared to lenses of fish fed a diet based on traditional marine ingredients (marine diet) with respect to biochemical composition and functionality ex vivo. After 12 months of feeding, plant diet-fed fish had smaller lenses with higher water contents and lower concentrations of histidine (His) and N-acetylhistidine (NAH) than fish fed with the marine diet. Cataract development in both dietary groups was minimal and no differences between the groups were observed. Lens fatty acid and lipid class composition differed minimally, although a significant increase in linoleic acid was observed. The lenses were examined for their ability to withstand osmotic disturbances ex vivo. Culture in hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic media led to increase and decrease of lens volume, respectively. Lenses from plant diet-fed fish were less resistant to swelling and shrinking, released less NAH into the culture medium, and accumulated His and NAH at higher rates than lenses from marine diet-fed fish. Culture in hypoosmotic medium resulted in higher cataract scores than in control and hyperosmotic medium. mRNA expression of selected genes, including glutathione peroxidase 4 and SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), was affected by diet and osmotic treatment. It can be concluded that lenses of farmed Atlantic salmon are affected by the diet composition, both in biochemical composition and physiological functionality in relation to osmoregulation.",M3
20027618,"<e>Lens</e> morphogenesis is dependent on Pax6-mediated inhibition of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the lens surface ectoderm.Lens formation in mouse is critically dependent on proper development of the retinal neuroectoderm that is located close beneath the head surface ectoderm. Signaling from the prospective retina triggers lens-specific gene expression in the surface-ectoderm. Supression of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the surface ectoderm is one of the prerequisites for lens development because, as we show here, ectopic Wnt activation in the retina and lens abrogates lens formation. Wnt inhibiton is mediated by signals coming from the retina but its exact mechanism is unknown. We show that Pax6 directly controls expression of several Wnt inhibitors such as Sfrp1, Sfrp2, and Dkk1 in the presumptive lens. In accordance, absence of Pax6 function leads to aberrant canonical Wnt activity in the presumptive lens that subsequently impairs lens development.

We investigated the effects of kynurenines on AGE synthesis in HLP. We found that incubation with 5 mM ribose or 5 mM ascorbate produced significant quantities of pentosidine, and this was further enhanced in the presence of two different kynurenines (200-500 microM): N-formylkynurenine (Nfk) and kynurenine (Kyn). Another related compound, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3OH-Kyn), had disparate effects; low concentrations (10-200 microM) promoted pentosidine synthesis, but high concentrations (200-500 microM) inhibited it. 3OH-Kyn showed similar effects on pentosidine synthesis from Amadori-enriched HLP or ribated lysine. Chelex-100 treatment of phosphate buffer reduced pentosidine synthesis from Amadori-enriched HLP by approximately 90%, but it did not inhibit the stimulating effect of 3OH-Kyn and EDTA. 3OH-Kyn (100-500 microM) spontaneously produced copious amounts of H(2)O(2) (10-25 microM), but externally added H(2)O(2) had only a mild stimulating effect on pentosidine but had no effect on N(epsilon)-carboxymethyl lysine (CML) synthesis in HLP from ribose and ascorbate. Further, human lens epithelial cells incubated with ribose and 3OH-Kyn showed higher intracellular pentosidine than cells incubated with ribose alone. CML synthesis from glycating agents was inhibited 30 to 50% by 3OH-Kyn at concentrations of 100-500 microM. Argpyrimidine synthesis from 5mM methylglyoxal was slightly inhibited by all kynurenines at concentrations of 100-500 microM. These results suggest that AGE synthesis in HLP is modulated by kynurenines, and such effects indicate a mode of interplay between kynurenines and carbohydrates important for AGE formation during lens aging and cataract formation.",M3
20027396,"Study of ocular aberrations with age.INTRODUCTION: Aging has various effects on visual system. Vision deteriorate, contrast sensitivity decreases and ocular aberrations apparently make the optical quality worse across the years. PURPOSE: To prospective evaluate ocular aberrations along the ages. METHODS: Three hundred and fifteen patients were examined, 155 were male (39.36%) and 160 were female (60.63%). Ages ranged from 5 to 64 year-old, the study was performed from February to November, 2004. Patients were divided into 4 age-groups according to IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) classification: 68 patients from 5 to 14 year-old, 55 patients from 15 to 24 year-old, 116 from 25 to 44 year-old and 76 from 45 to 67 year-old. All patients had the following characteristics: best corrected visual acuity &gt; 20/25, emmetropia or spherical equivalent &lt; 3.50 SD, refractive astigmatism &lt; 1.75 CD on cycloplegic refraction, normal ophthalmologic exam and no previous ocular surgeries. This protocol was approved by Federal University of São Paulo Institutional Review Board. Total optical aberrations were measured by H-S sensor LadarWave Custom Cornea Wavefront System (Alcon Laboratories Inc, Orlando, FLA, USA) and were statistically analysed. Corneal aberrations were calculated using CT-View software Version 6.89 (Sarver and Associates, Celebration, FL, USA). <e>Lens</e> aberrations were calculated by subtraction. RESULTS: High-order (0.32 e 0.48 microm) and ocular spherical aberrations (0.02 e 0.26 microm) increased respectively in child and middle age groups. High order (0.27 microm) and corneal spherical aberrations (0.05 microm) did not show changes with age. Lens showed a statistically significant spherical aberration increase (from -0.02 to 0.22 microm). Vertical (from 0.10 to -0.07 microm) and horizontal coma (from 0.01 to -0.12 microm) presented progressively negative values with aging. CONCLUSION: High-order and spherical aberrations increased with age due to lens contribution. The cornea did not affect significantly changes observed on ocular aberrations.",M3
20019876,"Tryptophan and kynurenine levels in lenses of Wistar and accelerated-senescence OXYS rats.PURPOSE: To determine the levels of kynurenine (KN) and its metabolic precursor tryptophan (Trp) in lenses of accelerated-senescence OXYS (cataract model) and Wistar (control) rats at ages from 1 day to 24 months. METHODS: Protein-free <e>lens</e> extracts were prepared from Wistar and senescent-accelerated OXYS rat lenses. The presence and levels of KN and Trp were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and mass spectrometric measurements. All statistical calculations were made using the software package Statistica 6.0, using factor dispersion analysis and Newman-Keuls post-hoc test for comparison of group mean values. RESULTS: The levels of KN, which plays the role of a molecular Ultraviolet (UV) filter in the human lens, and its metabolic precursor Trp in the rat lens significantly depend on the rat strain and age. During the first 20 days after birth, before the first signs of cataract in OXYS rats, there is a strong difference in the content of both Trp and KN between Wistar and OXYS lenses. This difference becomes insignificant in lenses of 1 month and older. The levels of Trp and KN in young lenses are higher than that in lenses of 1 month and older for both strains. CONCLUSIONS: The presented results demonstrate that the KN pathway of Trp catabolism does not play a significant role in cataract development in the rat lens at the stages of cataract manifestation; however, in the first 3 weeks of postnatal development, the interstrain difference in KN and Trp levels is very strong. The obtained results show a correlation between the low level of KN and the high level of Trp at the stage of lens maturation and future cataractogenesis, and suggest an imbalance in the KN pathway of Trp catabolism in potentially cataractous lenses.",M3
20021251,"<e>Lens</e> cadmium, lead, and serum vitamins C, E, and beta carotene in cataractous smoking patients.PURPOSE: To investigate the association between smoking and subcapsular cataract and blood levels of cadmium and lead, and serum levels of vitamins C, E, and beta carotene in the middle-age male population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The present study comprised 60 cataractous male patients aged 44-55 years who attended Mansoura University Ophthalmic Center. They were divided into two groups: the first group was comprised of 15 patients who had never smoked before with minimal exposure to cigarette smoking (control group), while the second group was comprised of 45 age and body mass index-matched smokers. Blood cadmium and lead concentrations were measured and their levels in the cataractous lenses were also estimated. The levels of some antioxidants, such as serum vitamins C, E, and beta carotene, were determined. RESULTS: Cadmium had a statistically significant higher concentration in blood and lenses of smokers compared with that of non smokers (p &lt; 0.0001). There was a significantly high accumulation of cadmium in the lenses of cataractous smokers reaching about a four-fold increase in heavy smokers (15.4 +/- 0.4 micromol/g) and nearly a three-fold increase in light smokers (10.1 +/- 0.4 micromol/g) when compared to that of nonsmokers (3.7 +/- 0.9 micromol/g). Regarding vitamins E, C, and beta carotene, a highly significant reduction was observed in smokers when compared with nonsmokers. There was a highly positive correlation between blood cadmium concentrations and lens cadmium levels, and blood lead concentrations and lens lead levels in heavy smokers. CONCLUSION: Cadmium present in high concentrations among smokers was associated with the presence of cataracts, through induction of oxidative stress as evidenced by reduction of levels of some antioxidant studied in this work, such as vitamins E, C, and beta carotene. Thus, education of health care professionals and the public about the cataractogenic effect of cadmium is mandatory. Intake of various antioxidants may be helpful in reducing the risk of cataract formation.",M3
20013402,"Studying lipid organization in biological membranes using liposomes and EPR spin labeling.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-labeling methods provide a unique opportunity to determine the lateral organization of lipid bilayer membranes by discrimination of coexisting membrane domains or coexisting membrane phases. In some cases, coexisting membrane domains can be characterized without the need for their physical separation by profiles of alkyl chain order, fluidity, hydrophobicity, and oxygen diffusion-concentration product in situ. This chapter briefly explains how EPR spin-labeling methods can be used to obtain the above-mentioned profiles across lipid bilayer membranes (liposomes). These procedures will be illustrated by EPR measurements performed on multilamellar liposomes made of lipid extracts from cortical and nuclear fractions of the fiber cell plasma membrane of a cow-eye <e>lens</e>. To better elucidate the major factors that determine membrane properties, results for eye lens lipid membranes and simple model membranes that resemble the basic lipid composition of biological membranes will be compared.",M3
20013805,"A novel role of gap junction connexin46 protein to protect breast tumors from hypoxia.Connexin proteins are the principle structural components of the gap junctions. Colocalization and tissue-specific expression of diverse connexin molecules are reported to occur in a variety of organs. Impairment of gap junctional intercellular communication, caused by mutations, gain of function or loss of function of connexins, is involved in a number of diseases including the development of cancer. Here we show that human breast cancer cells, MCF-7 and breast tumor tissues express a novel gap junction protein, connexin46 (Cx46) and it plays a critical role in hypoxia. Previous studies have shown that connexin46 is predominantly expressed in <e>lens</e> and our studies find that Cx46 protects human lens epithelial cells from hypoxia induced death. Interestingly, we find that Cx46 is upregulated in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and human breast cancer tumors. Downregulation of Cx46 by siRNA promotes 40% MCF-7 cell death at 24 hr under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, direct injection of anti-Cx46 siRNA into xenograft tumors prevents tumor growth in nude mice. This finding will provide an exciting new direction for drug development for breast cancer treatment and suggests that both normal hypoxic tissue (lens) and adaptive hypoxic tissue (breast tumor) utilize the same protein, Cx46, as a protective strategy from hypoxia.",M3
20011628,"Prevention of selenite-induced cataractogenesis by rutin in Wistar rats.PURPOSE: To investigate whether rutin retards selenite-induced cataractogenesis in Wistar rat pups. METHODS: On postpartum day ten, Group I rat pups received an intraperitoneal injection of saline. Group II and III rat pups received a subcutaneous injection of sodium selenite. Group III also received an intraperitoneal injection of rutin once daily on postpartum days 9-14. Both eyes of each pup were examined from day 16 up to postpartum day 30. After sacrifice, extricated pup lenses were analyzed for mean activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione reductase. In addition, the mean concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) and of malondialdehyde were analyzed in samples of lenses and hemolysate. RESULTS: There was dense lenticular opacification in all of Group II, minimal opacification in 33.3% of Group III, no opacification in 66.7% of Group III, and no opacification in Group I. Significantly lower mean activities of lenticular antioxidant enzymes were noted in Group II, compared to Group I and III. Significantly lower mean concentrations of GSH and higher mean concentrations of malondialdehyde were noted in samples of hemolysate and <e>lens</e> from Group II, compared to the values in Group I and III. CONCLUSION: Rutin prevents experimental selenite-induced cataractogenesis in rat pups, possibly by preventing depletion of antioxidant enzymes and of GSH, and by inhibiting lipid peroxidation.",M3
20012921,"Dose reduction in multislice CT by means of bismuth shields: results of in vivo measurements and computed evaluation.PURPOSE: We investigated the amount of patient dose reduction in the thyroid, <e>lens</e> of the eye and the breast when using bismuth protections in multislice computed tomography (CT) exams as well as their influence on the quality of diagnostic images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The radiation dose was measured by using thermoluminescence dosimeters. The study was conducted on the two CT scanners installed in our radiology department (64 and eight slices). The shield effects on the CT image were evaluated by measuring the signal-to-noise ratio in a phantom and in vivo, and by verifying the presence of artefacts on patients' images. The obtained organ-dose reduction factors were used to evaluate the effects of shielding on the effective dose. RESULTS: The shielding attenuation ranged from 30% to 60% depending on the CT scan protocols and organs. The difference between shielded and unshielded signal-to-noise ratio was statistically significant but within the standard requirements for quality assurance. Results were in agreement with the radiologists' perception of image quality. The use of the shields allowed up to 38% reduction of effective dose. CONCLUSIONS: Use of bismuth shields significantly decreases both organ and effective radiation dose, with a consequent reduction in health risk for the patient, quantified in 1.4 fewer cases of radiation-induced tumours every 5 years in our centre (12,100 exams/year), in agreement with the risk factors proposed by Publication 60 of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The relative inexpensiveness of these protections, their easy application and their substantial lack of influence on image quality suggest their massive introduction into routine clinical practice.",M3
20004233,"Investigation of gammaE-crystallin target protein binding to bovine <e>lens</e> alpha-crystallin by small-angle neutron scattering.alpha-Crystallin, one of the main constituent proteins in the crystalline lens, is an important molecular chaperone both within and outside the lens. Presently, the structural relationship between alpha-crystallin and its target proteins during chaperone action is poorly understood. It has been hypothesised that target proteins bind within a central cavity. Small-angle neutron-scattering (SANS) experiments in conjunction with isotopic substitution were undertaken to investigate the interaction of a target lens protein (gammaE-crystallin) with alpha-crystallin (alpha(H)) and to measure the radius of gyration (Rg) of the proteins and their binary complexes in solution under thermal stress. The size of the alpha(H) in D(2)O incubated at 65 degrees C increased from 69+/-3 to 81+/-5 A over 40 min, in good agreement with previously published small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and SANS measurements. Deuterated gammaE-crystallin in H(2)O buffer (gammaE(D)/H(2)O) and hydrogenous gammaE-crystallin in D(2)O buffer (gammaE(H)/D(2)O) free in solution were of insufficient size and/or too dilute to provide any measurable scattering over the angular range used, which was selected primarily to investigate gammaE:alpha(H) complexes. The evolution of the aggregation size/shape as an indicator of alpha(H) chaperone action was monitored by recording the neutron scattering in different H:D solvent contrasts under thermally stressed conditions (65 degrees C) for binary mixtures of alpha(H), gammaE(H), and gammaE(D). It was found that Rg(alpha(H):gammaE(D)/D(2)O)&gt;Rg(alpha(H):gammaE(H)/D(2)O)&gt;Rg(alpha(H)/D(2)O) and that Rg(alpha(H):gammaE(H)/D(2)O) approximately Rg(alpha(H)/D(2)O). The relative sizes observed for the complexes weighted by the respective scattering powers of the various components imply that gammaE-crystallin binds in a central cavity of the alpha-crystallin oligomer, during chaperone action.",M3
20006728,"Development and use of the <e>lens</e> epithelial explant system to study lens differentiation and cataractogenesis.Over the last two decades much progress has been made in identifying and characterizing many of the molecules involved in understanding normal lens biology and its pathology. Much of this has been made possible through the establishment and use of the lens epithelial explant system. This simplistic tissue culture model, comprised of a sheet of lens epithelium on its native substratum, has been used effectively to study many cellular processes, including lens epithelial cell proliferation, fiber cell differentiation, cell apoptosis as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation of cells. In doing so, a number of key growth factors and cytokines, including members of the FGF, Wnt and TGFbeta family have been shown to play essential roles in many of these cellular events. This has led to further studies exploring the signaling pathways downstream of these molecules in the lens, paving the way for the development of a number of in situ models (primarily transgenic mouse lines) to further explore in more detail the nature of these molecular and cellular interactions. To reciprocate, the lens epithelial explant system is increasingly being used to further characterize the nature of many complex phenotypes and pathologies observed in these in situ models, allowing us to selectively isolate and examine the direct impact of an individual molecule on a specific cellular response in lens cells. There is no question that the lens epithelial explant system has served as a powerful tool to further our understanding of lens biology and pathology, and there is no doubt that it will continue to serve in such a capacity, as new developments are realized and putative treatments for aberrant lens cell behavior are to be trialed.",M3
19968984,"Secreted frizzled-related protein disrupts PCP in eye <e>lens</e> fiber cells that have polarised primary cilia.Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling polarises cells along tissue axes. Although pathways involved are becoming better understood, outstanding issues include; (i) existence/identity of cues that orchestrate global polarisation in tissues, and (ii) the generality of the link between polarisation of primary cilia and asymmetric localisation of PCP proteins. Mammalian lenses are mainly comprised of epithelial-derived fiber cells. Concentrically arranged fibers are precisely aligned as they elongate along the anterior-posterior axis and orientate towards lens poles where they meet fibers from other segments to form characteristic sutures. We show that lens exhibits PCP, with each fiber cell having an apically situated cilium and in most cases this is polarised towards the anterior pole. Frizzled and other PCP proteins are also asymmetrically localised along the equatorial-anterior axis. Mutations in core PCP genes Van Gogh-like 2 and Celsr1 perturb oriented fiber alignment and suture formation. Suppression of the PCP pathway by overexpressing Sfrp2 shows that whilst local groups of fibers are often similarly oriented, they lack global orientation; consequently when local groups of fibers with different orientations meet they form multiple, small, ectopic suture-like configurations. This indicates that this extracellular inhibitor disrupts a global polarising signal that utilises a PCP-mediated mechanism to coordinate the global alignment and orientation of fibers to lens poles.",M3
19998718,"Metabolic changes during cataract formation by ultraviolet radiation in the incubated rabbit <e>lens</e>.We studied the energy metabolism of cataracts induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation by observing metabolic changes in lenses using 31P-, 1H-, and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. % of hexose monophosphate shunt flux activity increased over time. The lactate/glucose ratio in the UV irradiation group decreased to about half of that of the corresponding control group (11.6 +/- 2.0% vs. 20.7 +/- 1.7%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05) after 10 h of irradiation and to about 30% of that of the control group (25 +/- 2% vs. 92 +/- 6%, respectively) after 24 h. The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level significantly decreased after 3 h of irradiation (86 +/- 29%, p &lt; 0.05) and continuously decreased to 68 +/- 33% (p &lt; 0.01) after 10 h of irradiation and 26 +/- 2% (p &lt; 0.01) after 24 h of irradiation. Conversely, a significant increase in inorganic phosphate (Pi) was observed after 1 h of irradiation (111 +/- 26%, p &lt; 0.05), and the Pi level gradually increased to 140 +/- 28% after 10 h of irradiation (p &lt; 0.01) and 207 +/- 26% after 24 h (p &lt; 0.01). A significant decrease in alpha-glycerophosphate was noted after 24 h (38 +/- 13%, p &lt; 0.01). The ribose-5-phosphate (R-5-P) level gradually increased after irradiation to 128 +/- 13% (p &lt; 0.05) after 10 h and 141 +/- 21% after 24 h (p &lt; 0.01). The results suggest that of these metabolic changes a marked decline in glycolytic production of ATP, which inhibits membrane metabolism, may be an important cataract-inducing factor following UV irradiation.",M3

Nuclear cataract is graded according to the severity of opacity using slit-lamp <e>lens</e> images. Anatomical structure in the lens image is detected using a modified active shape model (ASM). Based on the anatomical landmark, local features are extracted according to clinical grading protocol. Support vector machine (SVM) regression is employed to train a grading model for grade prediction. The system is tested using clinical images and clinical ground truth. More than five thousands slit-lamp images were tested. The success rate of feature extraction is 95% and the mean grading difference is 0.36. The automatic diagnosis system can help to improve the grading objectivity and save the workload of ophthalmologists.",M3
19966402,"Nanoceria have no genotoxic effect on human <e>lens</e> epithelial cells.There are no treatments for reversing or halting cataract, a disease of the structural proteins in the eye lens, that has associations with other age-related degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. The incidence of cataract and associated conditions is increasing as the average age of the population rises. Protein folding diseases are difficult to assess in vivo as proteins and their age-related changes are assessed after extraction. Nanotechnology can be used to investigate protein changes in the intact lens as well as for a potential means of drug delivery. Nanoparticles, such as cerium oxide (CeO(2)) which have antioxidant properties, may even be used as a means of treating cataract directly. Prior to use in treatments, nanoparticle genotoxicity must be tested to assess the extent of any DNA or chromosomal damage. Sister chromatid exchanges were measured and DNA damage investigated using the alkaline COMET assay on cultured human lens epithelial cells, exposed to 5 and 10 microg ml(-1) of CeO(2) nanoparticles (nanoceria). Nanoceria at these dosages did not cause any DNA damage or significant increases in the number of sister chromatid exchanges. The absence of genotoxic effects on lens cells suggests that nanoceria, in the doses and exposures tested in this study, are not deleterious to the eye lens and have the potential for use in studying structural alterations, in developing non-surgical cataract treatments and in investigating other protein folding diseases.",M3
19959602,"Dose reduction in CT using bismuth shielding: measurements and Monte Carlo simulations.In this research, using direct measurements and Monte Carlo calculations, the potential dose reduction achieved by bismuth shielding in computed tomography was evaluated. The patient dose was measured using an ionisation chamber in a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) phantom that had five measurement points at the centre and periphery. Simulations were performed using the MCNPX code. For both the bare and the bismuth-shielded phantom, the differences of dose values between experiment and simulation were within 9%. The dose reductions due to the bismuth shielding were 1.2-55% depending on the measurement points, X-ray tube voltage and the type of shielding. The amount of dose reduction was significant for the positions covered by the bismuth shielding (34 - 46% for head and 41 - 55% for body phantom on average) and negligible for other peripheral positions. The artefact on the reconstructed images were minimal when the distance between the shielding and the organs was &gt;1 cm, and hence the shielding should be selectively located to protect critical organs such as the eye <e>lens</e>, thyroid and breast. The simulation results using the PMMA phantom was compared with those using a realistically voxelised phantom (KTMAN-2). For eye and breast, the simulation results using the PMMA and KTMAN-2 phantoms were similar with each other, while for thyroid the simulation results were different due to the discrepancy of locations and the sizes of the phantoms. The dose reductions achieved by bismuth and lead shielding were compared with each other and the results showed that the difference of the dose reductions achieved by the two materials was less than 2-3%.",M3

METHODS: Four groups (PC monitor, PC monitor plus vitamin C, vitamin C, and control) each consisting of ten Wistar rats were studied. The study lasted for three weeks. Vitamin C was administered in oral doses of 250 mg/kg/day. The computer and computer plus vitamin C groups were exposed to computer monitors while the other groups were not. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) activities were measured in corneal and lens tissues of the rats. RESULTS: In corneal tissue, MDA levels and CAT activity were found to increase in the computer group compared with the control group. In the computer plus vitamin C group, MDA level, SOD, and GSH-Px activities were higher and CAT activity lower than those in the computer and control groups. Regarding lens tissue, in the computer group, MDA levels and GSH-Px activity were found to increase, as compared to the control and computer plus vitamin C groups, and SOD activity was higher than that of the control group. In the computer plus vitamin C group, SOD activity was found to be higher and CAT activity to be lower than those in the control group. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that computer-monitor radiation leads to oxidative stress in the corneal and lens tissues, and that vitamin C may prevent oxidative effects in the lens.",M3
19946073,"Multiple photoreceptor systems control the swim pacemaker activity in box jellyfish.Like all other cnidarian medusae, box jellyfish propel themselves through the water by contracting their bell-shaped body in discrete swim pulses. These pulses are controlled by a swim pacemaker system situated in their sensory structures, the rhopalia. Each medusa has four rhopalia each with a similar set of six eyes of four morphologically different types. We have examined how each of the four eye types influences the swim pacemaker. Multiple photoreceptor systems, three of the four eye types, plus the rhopalial neuropil, affect the swim pacemaker. The lower <e>lens</e> eye inhibits the pacemaker when stimulated and provokes a strong increase in the pacemaker frequency upon light-off. The upper lens eye, the pit eyes and the rhopalial neuropil all have close to the opposite effect. When these responses are compared with all-eye stimulations it is seen that some advanced integration must take place.",M3
19956408,"The membrane proteome of the mouse <e>lens</e> fiber cell.PURPOSE: Fiber cells of the ocular lens are bounded by a highly specialized plasma membrane. Despite the pivotal role that membrane proteins play in the physiology and pathophysiology of the lens, our knowledge of the structure and composition of the fiber cell plasma membrane remains fragmentary. In the current study, we utilized mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics to provide a comprehensive survey of the mouse lens fiber cell membrane proteome. METHODS: Membranes were purified from young mouse lenses and subjected to MudPIT (Multidimensional protein identification technology) analysis. The resulting proteomic data were analyzed further by reference to publically available microarray databases. RESULTS: More than 200 membrane proteins were identified by MudPIT, including Type I, Type II, Type III (multi-pass), lipid-anchored, and GPI-anchored membrane proteins, in addition to membrane-associated cytoskeletal elements and extracellular matrix components. The membrane proteins of highest apparent abundance included Mip, Lim2, and the lens-specific connexin proteins Gja3, Gja8, and Gje1. Significantly, many proteins previously unsuspected in the lens were also detected, including proteins with roles in cell adhesion, solute transport, and cell signaling. CONCLUSIONS: The MudPIT technique constitutes a powerful technique for the analysis of the lens membrane proteome and provides valuable insights into the composition of the lens fiber cell unit membrane.",M3
19938749,"Bilateral traumatic anterior crystalline <e>lens</e> dislocation by watersplash during Songkran festival: case report.OBJECTIVE: To report a case of bilateral anterior dislocated crystalline lens from water splash during the Songkran festival. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A healthy 46-year-old woman with a previous history of having water thrown to her face at the Songkran festival complained of acute bilateral painful visual loss. On examination, visual acuity was 0.1 OD, 0.2 OS, and both eyes revealed anterior dislocated crystalline lens with blood in anterior chamber. Her intraocular pressure (IOP) was 8 mmHg OD and 47 mmHg OS. She was initially treated with medication for controlling IOP and inflammation. Eventually, she underwent pars plana vitrectomy, pars plana lensectomy, and scleral-fixated intraocular lens (SF-IOL) in both eyes. RESULTS: The dislocated lens was successfully removed and visual acuity was 0.7 OD and 0.9 OS at 9 months follow-up. CONCLUSION: Water splash can be associated with anterior lens dislocation and secondary glaucoma. Awareness, careful examination, and prompt referral to an ophthalmologist can prevent complications and preserve the patient's vision.",M3
19941852,"Dynamic regulation of GSH synthesis and uptake pathways in the rat <e>lens</e> epithelium.Glutathione (GSH) is an essential antioxidant required for the maintenance of lens transparency. In the lens, GSH levels are maintained by a combination of de novo synthesis and or direct uptake of GSH from the aqueous. Previous work in our laboratory has sought to identify and spatially localise the different components involved in GSH synthesis and uptake. Utilizing a high resolution imaging technique, we have mapped the distributions of GSH and its precursor amino acids cyst(e)ine, glutamate and glycine throughout the entire rat lens. An interesting observation from these studies was the marked difference in the localization of GSH and its precursor amino acids in the equatorial epithelium. While GSH was high in the equatorial lens epithelium there was an absence of cystine, glutamate and glycine. These results indicate that precursor amino acids were depleted through GSH synthesis or the source for GSH accumulation in the equatorial epithelium is primarily by uptake from the aqueous. In this paper, we have examined the contributions of GSH synthesis and uptake pathways in the different regions of the rat lens epithelium. We have extended and compared our mapping of GSH and its precursor amino acids to the central lens epithelium and have included labeling for gamma-GCS, the rate limiting enzyme for GSH synthesis. We show that spatial differences in GSH synthesis and uptake pathways exist between the equatorial and central epithelium. Moreover, in a distinct region of the equatorial epithelium, we were able to induce an increase in the labeling of precursor amino acids and gamma-GCS indicating that a dynamic switch from GSH uptake to GSH synthesis in response to depletion of extracellular GSH from the culture media had occurred. Finally, we also describe the identification of a putative GSH transporter which is most likely to mediate GSH uptake in this region.",M3
19936027,"ERalpha increases expression and interacts with TERT in cataractous canine <e>lens</e> epithelial cells.PURPOSE: Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) expression has previously been evaluated in lens epithelial cells (LEC). However, its function in the lens has not been determined. One potential function may be its interaction with the catalytic subunit of telomerase (TERT), which is present in normal LEC and higher in LEC that have undergone epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). ERalpha is known to play a role in EMT, a process that may also involve TERT. METHODS: A commercially available transcription factor array was used to evaluate potential interactions between TERT and other proteins in normal and cataractous LEC. Based on these findings, ERalpha protein and mRNA expressions were measured using western blot analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to evaluate the interaction of TERT with ERalpha as well as their phosphorylation in normal and cataractous LEC. RESULTS: The transcription factor array suggested that TERT interacted with ERalpha via the estrogen response element (ERE) in cataractous LEC but not in normal LEC. Expression of ERalpha protein and mRNA increased in cataractous LEC compared with normal LEC. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the interaction of TERT with ERalpha in cataractous LEC while no interaction was found in normal LEC. LEC that have undergone EMT, e.g., cataracts, are rapidly proliferating and migrating along the posterior lens capsule. CONCLUSIONS: ERalpha is known to play a role in EMT, and our data suggests that TERT and phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAkt) may be involved in the regulation of this process in cataractous LEC.",M3

Age-related changes in crystallin expression have been well documented in mammals but are poorly understood in the zebrafish. METHODS: In the zebrafish lens, a systematic analysis of protein content with age was performed using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with linear trap quadrupole Fourier transform tandem mass spectrometry (LTQ-FT LC-MS/MS; rank-order shotgun) proteomics in lenses of larval, juvenile, and adult zebrafish. RESULTS: alpha-Crystallins, previously shown to have low abundance in the zebrafish lens, were found to increase dramatically with maturation and aging. SEC determined that beta-crystallin was predominant at 4.5 days. With age, the alpha- and gamma-crystallins increased, and a high molecular weight fraction appeared between six weeks and six months to become the dominant component by 2.5 years. Similarly, shotgun proteomics determined that beta-crystallins were the predominant proteins in the young lens. With age, the proportion of alpha- and gamma-crystallins increased dramatically. After crystallins, calpain 3, membrane, and cytoskeletal proteins were most abundant. Five new beta-crystallins and 13 new gamma-crystallins were identified. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, SEC and proteomics demonstrated changing levels of protein expression with age, especially among the crystallins. The results also confirmed the existence of novel crystallins in the zebrafish genome.",M3
19931246,"Electric currents and <e>lens</e> regeneration in the rat.We studied the process of lens regeneration in the rat following an extracapsular lens extraction preserving the anterior lens capsule and anterior lens epithelium. We assessed clinically the clarity of the newly regenerated lens, evaluated changes in the lens electrical currents following surgery and during the regeneration process and correlated these changes with findings on light microscopy. Protein analysis of the regenerated lens was also undertaken. Experiments were performed in 41 Sprague-Dawley rats, sacrificed at 0, 2, 4 and 8 weeks postoperatively. Our results showed that complete lens regeneration occurred 8 weeks postoperatively only if the anterior epithelium was preserved and the lens capsule was closed surgically. Lens electrical currents, altered following surgery, recovered in parallel with the process of regeneration of the lens. The newly regenerated lens was optically clear and biochemical analysis revealed a pattern of protein expression resembling that observed during lens development. In conclusion, complete lens regeneration occurs in the rat and it is possible that lens electrical signals, together with other cues, may play an important role in this process.",M3
19932168,"Curcumin prevents free radical-mediated cataractogenesis through modulations in <e>lens</e> calcium.The generation of free radicals has been implicated in the causation of cataract, and compounds that can scavenge free radicals ameliorate the disease process. This study investigated the possible free radical scavenging potential of curcumin at a dose of 75 mg/kg body wt on selenium-induced cataract in rat pups. Intraperitoneal injection of sodium selenite (15 micromol/kg body wt) into 8- to 10-day-old rat pups led to severe oxidative stress in the eye lens as evidenced by increased nitric oxide, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radical generation and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression that probably led to cataract formation. Selenium exposure also caused an increase in total calcium in the eye lens and significantly inhibited the activity of Ca(2+) ATPase but not Na(+)/K(+) ATPase or Mg(2+) ATPase. On the other hand, pretreatment with curcumin, but not simultaneous or posttreatment, led to a decrease in oxidative stress and also rescued the selenium-mediated increase in lens Ca(2+) and inhibition of Ca(2+) ATPase activity in the eye lens. The results of this study demonstrate that an increase in free radical generation triggered by selenium could cause inactivation of lens Ca(2+) ATPase leading to Ca(2+) accumulation. This enhanced Ca(2+) can cause activation of calpain-mediated proteolysis in the lens, resulting in lens opacification. Curcumin in this study was able to prevent selenium-induced oxidative stress leading to activation of Ca(2+) ATPase and inhibition of lens opacification. Thus, curcumin has the potential to function as an anticataractogenic agent, possibly by preventing free radical-mediated accumulation of Ca(2+) in the eye lens.",M3
19925778,"Reevaluation of the phospholipid composition in membranes of adult human lenses by (31)P NMR and MALDI MS.The phospholipid composition of adult human <e>lens</e> membranes differs dramatically from that of any other mammalian membrane. Due to minimal cell turnover, cells in the nucleus of the human lens may be considered as the longest lived cells in our body. This work reassesses previous assignments of phospholipid (31)P NMR resonances in adult human lenses. The new assignments are based not only on chemical shifts but also on temperature coefficients. By addition of known phospholipids and examination by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, several misassigned resonances have been corrected. The revised composition reveals the possible presence of ceramide-1-phosphate and dihydroceramide-1-phosphate. Among glycerophospholipids, the most abundant one does not correspond to phosphatidylglycerol but may be due to the lysoform of alkyl-acyl analogs of phosphatidylethanolamine. Besides sphingophospholipids, adult human lens membranes contain significant amounts of ether (1-O-alkyl) glycerophospholipids and their corresponding lysoforms.",M3
19925789,"Ultraviolet radiation transmittance of the mouse eye and its individual media components.Recently, the mouse has become the preferred animal model in ophthalmic research. Therefore, there is a need for enhanced understanding of the mouse eye to validate its use in different experimental setting. The purpose of this study was to determine the ocular transmittance of the whole mouse eye, the cornea and the crystalline <e>lens</e>, particularly in the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) wavebands. This was carried out using a non-cuvette based fiber optic spectrometer system and the resulting transmittance curves were compared with published cone spectral response curves and mouse ocular transmittance data. First, transmittance curves of the whole mouse eye were measured by removing a small disc of sclera from the posterior pole to provide an anterior to posterior optical path. No statistical difference was found between left and right eye in each of the four mice sampled, therefore, all eight eyes were included in the final statistical analysis. The average of five test measurements from each left and right eye for the four test mice showed a transmittance cut off at approximately 310 nm. Secondly, the cornea with a scleral rim was excised and transmittance curves obtained for all eight eyes. This data showed an average transmittance cut off at 280 nm for the cornea. Similarly measured data for the excised crystalline lens showed UVR transmittance down to 310 nm. The good correlation between total ocular UVR transmittance and the sum of the individually measured components (i.e. the cornea and the crystalline lens) supported the validity of our method and its findings. This experiment demonstrated that the mouse cornea transmits more UV-B (280-315 nm) than the rabbit and the human corneal transmittance. The mouse crystalline lens on the other hand showed a cut off in the UV-B at 310 nm, which is at a much lower UV-B wavelength than the approximate UV-A (315-400 nm) cut off for the human crystalline lens at around 390 nm. The increased transmittance of UVR in the mouse eye serves its vision, since the mouse has a cone photopigment peaking at approximately 350 nm. Due to the above stated differences between the mouse and the human it is concluded that the mouse is not an ideal model for the human eye in experiments involving UVR.",M3
19913507,"Methylglyoxal induces cellular damage by increasing argpyrimidine accumulation and oxidative DNA damage in human <e>lens</e> epithelial cells.Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a cytotoxic metabolite and modifies tissue proteins through the Maillard reaction, resulting in advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which can alter protein structure and functions. Several MGO-derived AGEs have been described, including argpyrimidine, a fluorescent product of the MGO reaction with arginine residues. Herein, we evaluated the cytotoxic role of MGO in human lens epithelial cell line (HLE-B3). HLE-B3 cells were exposed to 400 microM MGO in the present or absence of pyridoxamine for 24h. We then examined the formation of argpyrimidine, apoptosis and oxidative stress in HLE-B3 cells. In MGO-treated HLE-B3 cells, the accumulation of argpyrimidine was markedly increased, and caspase-3 and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were highly expressed, which paralleled apoptotic cell death. However, pyridoxamine (AGEs inhibitor) prevented the argpyrimidine formation and apoptosis of MGO-treated HLE-B3 cells. These results suggested that the accumulation of argpyrimidine and oxidative DNA damage caused by MGO are involved in apoptosis of HLE-B3 cells.",M3
19921769,"Effect of a suction device for femtosecond laser on anterior chamber depth and crystalline <e>lens</e> position measured by OCT.PURPOSE: To investigate the position and stability of the crystalline lens after application of a suction device containing a contact lens and a vacuum unit for the treatment of presbyopia using a femtosecond laser. METHODS: Twenty presbyopic (44.4+/-4.3 years) and 5 pre-presbyopic patients (31.6+/-3.8 years) were included. The anterior chamber depth, along with the position of the lens, was investigated before and after application of the suction device with optical coherence tomography (Visante OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). The type of suction device is routinely used for femtosecond LASIK with the VisuMax laser (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). RESULTS: In both groups, there was a reduction in anterior chamber depth of approximately 700 microm due to the suction device, and the anterior chamber depth achieved was stable. The maximum variation was 160 microm. At the periphery of the crystalline lens, there were movements up to 310 microm axially and 470 microm laterally. CONCLUSIONS: The study proves that once the suction device has been applied, the crystalline lens is stable enough to undergo presbyopic laser therapy. However, the reduction in anterior chamber depth induced by the suction device showed significant individual variation. The exact position of the lens should therefore be measured immediately before laser surgery.",M3
19906980,"Neuroprotective and axon growth-promoting effects following inflammatory stimulation on mature retinal ganglion cells in mice depend on ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor.After optic nerve injury retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) normally fail to regenerate axons in the optic nerve and undergo apoptosis. However, <e>lens</e> injury (LI) or intravitreal application of zymosan switch RGCs into an active regenerative state, enabling these neurons to survive axotomy and to regenerate axons into the injured optic nerve. Several factors have been proposed to mediate the beneficial effects of LI. Here, we investigated the contribution of glial-derived ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) to LI-mediated regeneration and neuroprotection using wild-type and CNTF-deficient mice. In wild-type mice, CNTF expression was strongly upregulated in retinal astrocytes, the JAK/STAT3 pathway was activated in RGCs, and RGCs were transformed into an active regenerative state after LI. Interestingly, retinal LIF expression was correlated with CNTF expression after LI. In CNTF-deficient mice, the neuroprotective and axon growth-promoting effects of LI were significantly reduced compared with wild-type animals, despite an observed compensatory upregulation of LIF expression in CNTF-deficient mice. The positive effects of LI and also zymosan were completely abolished in CNTF/LIF double knock-out mice, whereas LI-induced glial and macrophage activation was not compromised. In culture CNTF and LIF markedly stimulated neurite outgrowth of mature RGCs. These data confirm a key role for CNTF in directly mediating the neuroprotective and axon regenerative effects of inflammatory stimulation in the eye and identify LIF as an additional contributing factor.",M3

19899984,"Changes in the X-ray diffraction pattern from <e>lens</e> during a solid-to-liquid phase transition.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare the structural integrity of bovine lenses using small-angle X-ray diffraction techniques, before and after freezing, using both liquid nitrogen and a -20 degrees C freezer to understand the molecular changes that occur and to see if any permanent structural changes result from the freezing and thawing process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used small-angle X-ray scattering to investigate the effects of freezing whole bovine eye lenses (i) in liquid nitrogen and (ii) at -20 degrees C, to better understand the structural basis of the phase transitions. RESULTS: Lenses frozen in liquid nitrogen thawed more rapidly than those placed at -20 degrees C. With both freezing methods, X-ray patterns taken during the thawing process indicated less protein order than before or after freezing. After both freezing methods, the X-ray reflection returned to its original spacing and close to its original intensity values before freezing. CONCLUSIONS: We explain these phenomena in terms of a simple model based on the melting of ice crystals. We also suggest that the liquid nitrogen method of freezing is probably the better method of cryo-preservation for maintaining lens crystallin order.",M3
19901216,"Risk of cataract extraction among adult retinoblastoma survivors.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of cataract extraction among adult retinoblastoma survivors. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was performed on retinoblastoma survivors who received the diagnosis from 1914 to 1984 and were interviewed in 2000. <e>Lens</e> doses were estimated from radiotherapy records. The cumulative time interval to cataract extraction between dose groups was compared using the log-rank test and Cox regression. RESULTS: Seven hundred fifty-three subjects (828 eyes) were available for analysis for an average of 32 years of follow-up. During this period, 51 cataract extractions were reported. One extraction was reported in an eye with no radiotherapy compared with 36 extractions in 306 eyes with 1 course of radiotherapy and 14 among 38 eyes with 2 or 3 treatments. The average time interval to cataract extraction in irradiated eyes was 51 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 48-54) following 1 treatment and 32 years (95% CI, 27-37) after 2 or 3 treatments. Eyes exposed to a therapeutic radiation dose of 5 Gy or more had a 6-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.3-27.2) of cataract extraction compared with eyes exposed to 2.5 Gy or less. CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize the importance of ophthalmologic examination of retinoblastoma survivors who have undergone radiotherapy. The risk of cataract extraction in untreated eyes with retinoblastoma is comparable with the risk of the general population.",M3
19892812,"Radiation dose to the <e>lens</e> using different temporal bone CT scanning protocols.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Temporal bone CT is performed frequently in clinical practice. At the same time, the eye lens are exposed to ionizing radiation without any useful diagnostic information delivered. Our aim was to investigate the radiation dose to the lens of the eye by using temporal bone CT scanning with different protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Direct axial and coronal CT by using a conventional sequential scanning mode (140 kV, 220 mAs/section, 1.25-mm thickness, 1.25-mm increment, 16 x 0.625 mm collimation, the glabellomeatal line as a scanning baseline), a routine helical scanning mode (140 kV, 220 mAs/section, 0.315 pitch, 0.67-mm thickness, 0.33-mm increment, 16 x 0.625 collimation, the orbitomeatal line as a scanning baseline), and a modified helical scanning mode (acanthiomeatal line as a scanning baseline; other parameters, same as above) was performed on an exsomatized cadaveric head. CTDI(vol) and DLP were recorded for each scanning mode, and effective doses were calculated. Organ doses for the lens were measured with TLDs. RESULTS: When the sequential scanning mode was used, the gross effective dose was 1.21 mSv and the organ dose to the lens was 50.96 and 1.73 mGy, respectively, for direct axial and coronal imaging. The effective dose was 0.803 mSv in routine helical scanning, while the lens dose was 40.17 mGy. With the modified helical scanning mode, the effective dose was as same as that for the routine helical scanning, but the lens dose was reduced significantly to 10.33 mGy. CONCLUSIONS: The effective doses resulting from sequential axial and coronal scanning were 1.51 times higher than the dose from helical scanning, and the lens dose was 1.31 times higher. With the modified helical scanning mode, thinner section images could be used to reformat axial, coronal, and sagittal images with a further 74.3% reduction in lens dose beyond that achieved with the conventional helical protocol.",M3
19889963,"Protein expression profiling of <e>lens</e> epithelial cells from Prdx6-depleted mice and their vulnerability to UV radiation exposure.Oxidative stress is one of the causative factors in progression and etiology of age-related cataract. Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6), a savior for cells from internal or external environmental stresses, plays a role in cellular signaling by detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby controlling gene regulation. Using targeted inactivation of the Prdx6 gene, we show that Prdx6-deficient lens epithelial cells (LECs) are more vulnerable to UV-triggered cell death, a major cause of skin disorders including cataractogenesis, and these cells display abnormal protein profiles. PRDX6-depleted LECs showed phenotypic changes and formed lentoid body, a characteristic of terminal cell differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Prdx6(-/-) LECs exposed to UV-B showed higher ROS expression and were prone to apoptosis compared with wild-type LECs, underscoring a protective role for Prdx6. Comparative proteomic analysis using fluorescence-based difference gel electrophoresis along with mass spectrometry and database searching revealed a total of 13 proteins that were differentially expressed in Prdx6(-/-) cells. Six proteins were upregulated, whereas expression of seven proteins was decreased compared with Prdx6(+/+) LECs. Among the cytoskeleton-associated proteins that were highly expressed in Prdx6-deficient LECs was tropomyosin (Tm)2beta. Protein blot and real-time PCR validated dramatic increase of Tm2beta and Tm1alpha expression in these cells. Importantly, Prdx6(+/+) LECs showed a similar pattern of Tm2beta protein expression after transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta or H(2)O(2) treatment. An extrinsic supply of PRDX6 could restore Tm2beta expression, demonstrating that PRDX6 may attenuate adverse signaling in cells and thereby maintain cellular homeostasis. Exploring redox-proteomics (Prdx6(-/-)) and characterization and identification of abnormally expressed proteins and their attenuation by PRDX6 delivery should provide a basis for development of novel therapeutic interventions to postpone ROS-mediated abnormal signaling deleterious to cells or tissues.",M3
19883592,"Sorting of <e>lens</e> aquaporins and connexins into raft and nonraft bilayers: role of protein homo-oligomerization.Two classes of channel-forming proteins in the eye lens, the water channel aquaporin-0 (AQP-0) and the connexins Cx46 and Cx50, are preferentially located in different regions of lens plasma membranes (1,2). Because these membranes contain high concentrations of cholesterol and sphingomyelin, as well as phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine with unsaturated hydrocarbon chains, microdomains (rafts) form in these membranes. Here we test the hypothesis that sorting into lipid microdomains can play a role in the disposition of AQP-0 and the connexins in the plane of the membrane. For both crude membrane fractions and proteoliposomes composed of lens proteins in phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin/cholesterol lipid bilayers, detergent extraction experiments showed that the connexins were located primarily in detergent soluble membrane (DSM) fractions, whereas AQP-0 was found in both detergent resistant membrane and DSM fractions. Analysis of purified AQP-0 reconstituted in raft-containing bilayers showed that the microdomain location of AQP-0 depended on protein/lipid ratio. AQP-0 was located almost exclusively in DSMs at a 1:1200 AQP-0/lipid ratio, whereas approximately 50% of the protein was sequestered into detergent resistant membranes at a 1:100 ratio, where freeze-fracture experiments show that AQP-0 oligomerizes (3). Consistent with these detergent extraction results, confocal microscopy images showed that AQP-0 was sequestered into raft microdomains in the 1:100 protein/lipid membranes. Taken together these results indicate that AQP-0 and connexins can be segregated in the membrane by protein-lipid interactions as modified by AQP-0 homo-oligomerization.",M3
19878832,"Visualization of femtosecond laser pulse-induced microincisions inside crystalline <e>lens</e> tissue.PURPOSE: To evaluate a new method for visualizing femtosecond laser pulse-induced microincisions inside crystalline lens tissue. SETTING: Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V., Hannover, Germany. METHOD: Lenses removed from porcine eyes were modified ex vivo by femtosecond laser pulses (wavelength 1040 nm, pulse duration 306 femtoseconds, pulse energy 1.0 to 2.5 microJ, repetition rate 100 kHz) to create defined planes at which lens fibers separate. The femtosecond laser pulses were delivered by a 3-dimension (3-D) scanning unit and transmitted by focusing optics (numerical aperture 0.18) into the lens tissue. Lens fiber orientation and femtosecond laser-induced microincisions were examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) based on a Rostock Cornea Module attached to a Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II. Optical sections were analyzed in 3-D using Amira software (version 4.1.1). RESULTS: Normal lens fibers showed a parallel pattern with diameters between 3 microm and 9 microm, depending on scanning location. Microincision visualization showed different cutting effects depending on pulse energy of the femtosecond laser. The effects ranged from altered tissue-scattering properties with all fibers intact to definite fiber separation by a wide gap. Pulse energies that were too high or overlapped too tightly produced an incomplete cutting plane due to extensive microbubble generation. CONCLUSIONS: The 3-D CLSM method permitted visualization and analysis of femtosecond laser pulse-induced microincisions inside crystalline lens tissue. Thus, 3-D CLSM may help optimize femtosecond laser-based procedures in the treatment of presbyopia.",M3
19878828,"Intraocular pressure reduction after phacoemulsification with intraocular <e>lens</e> implantation in glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes: evaluation of a causal relationship between the natural lens and open-angle glaucoma.PURPOSE: To study the long-term effects of phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in nonglaucomatous and glaucomatous eyes. SETTING: Phillips Eye Institute, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and private practice, Savannah, Georgia, USA. METHODS: Intraocular pressure (IOP) after phacoemulsification with IOL implantation was retrospectively reviewed. Eyes were divided into 5 groups by preoperative IOP. Data were recorded preoperatively, 1 year postoperatively, and at the final check. Analysis included preoperative IOP versus IOP at 1 year and final IOP, percentage of eyes with elevated or reduced IOP postoperatively, patient age at surgery, and years of postoperative follow-up. RESULTS: The study comprised 124 eyes. The final mean IOP reduction was 8.5 mm Hg (34%) in the 29 to 23 mm Hg group, 4.6 mm Hg (22%) in the 22 to 20 mm Hg group, 3.4 mm Hg (18%) in the 19 to 18 mm Hg group, and 1.1 mm Hg (10%) in the 17 to 15 mm Hg group. In the 14 to 5 mm Hg group, IOP increased by 1.7 mm Hg (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Intraocular pressure reduction was proportional to preoperative IOP; the highest preoperative IOPs decreased the most and the lowest increased slightly. One-year IOP reductions were sustained for 10 years and were similar in patients of all ages. The IOP reductions were similar to previously reported reductions in nonglaucomatous eyes, indicating that the aging crystalline lens may be a major cause of ocular hypertension and glaucoma and that phacoemulsification with IOL implantation may help prevent and treat adult glaucoma.",M3
19878821,"Role of ultrasound and biomicroscopy in evaluation of anterior segment anatomy in congenital and developmental cataract cases.PURPOSE: To investigate the role of ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in the evaluation of anterior segment anatomy in cases of congenital and developmental cataract. SETTING: Alexandria Main University Hospital, Ophthalmology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt. METHODS: In this cross-sectional nonrandomized unmasked study, ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) was used to evaluate the anterior segment anatomy of 32 eyes of 21 children with congenital and developmental cataract. The parents were questioned for details of the children's history. An initial office examination was done to detect visual function, pupil color, <e>lens</e> morphology, corneal clarity, and presence of gross anterior segment anomaly. If the fundus was visible, it was examined in cooperative children after mydriasis. Under general anesthesia, each child was examined by UBM. RESULTS: The parameters detected by UBM included anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, zonular fiber length, ciliary process length, anterior chamber angle, and lens morphology. A-scan biometry was also performed to detect anterior chamber biometric characteristics. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound biomicroscopy is a valuable tool for evaluating childhood cataracts and associated ocular anomalies as well as anterior segment biometric characteristics.",M3
19875662,"Posttranslational modifications of the bovine <e>lens</e> beaded filament proteins filensin and CP49.PURPOSE: The lens beaded filament proteins filensin and CP49 are phosphorylated proteins that undergo proteolytic degradation with fiber cell age; however, the specific sites of modifications remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in bovine lens beaded filament proteins. METHODS: Filensin and CP49 were enriched by urea extraction of lens fiber cell homogenates after the water-soluble fraction was removed. The urea-soluble fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the corresponding filensin and CP49 bands were digested by trypsin, Lys C, or Glu C. The enzymatic digests were analyzed by HPLC mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The sequences of lens beaded filament proteins were systematically mapped, and putative database sequence errors of filensin were identified. The data also indicated that Met-1 of CP49 was removed and Ser2 was acetylated. Nine phosphorylation sites on filensin and seven phosphorylation sites on CP49 were identified. Filensin was found to be truncated at D431 and L39, and the resulting new N termini were N-myristoylated and N-acetylated, respectively. Truncation of CP49 occurred at D37. Aspartic acid isomerization to isoaspartic acid occurs at the major truncation sites of filensin (D431) and of CP49 (D37). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified sites of phosphorylation and truncation in filensin and CP49 and revealed two unusual PTMs: postproteolytic N-acetylation and N-myristoylation of filensin. The detailed knowledge about these PTMs provides important information for further study of their functional consequences-for example protein redistribution during lens fiber cell differentiation and aging.",M3
19875656,"Ocular component growth curves among Singaporean children with different refractive error status.PURPOSE: To describe and compare ocular component growth curves among different refractive error groups in Singaporean children. METHODS: Data collected yearly in 1775 Asian children aged 6 to 10 years with at least three visits were analyzed. Cycloplegic refractive error and biometry variables were measured by autorefractor and A-scan ultrasound machine. Growth curves were compared between five groups: persistent hyperopia of spherical equivalent (SE) &gt; +1.00 D, emmetropizing hyperopia of SE &gt; +1.00 D on the first visit and between -0.50 D and +1.00 D subsequently, persistent emmetropia of SE between -0.50 D and +1.00 D, incident myopia of SE &lt;or= -0.50 D at subsequent visits, and persistent myopia of SE &lt;or= -0.50 D. RESULTS: The axial length and vitreous chamber elongated faster in the children younger than 10 years, but elongation slowed with age. Growth patterns of axial length and vitreous chamber in the children with newly developed or persistent myopia (P &lt; 0.01) showed faster elongation than in the emmetropic children. The anterior chamber deepened until approximately 9 or 10 years of age but became shallower as the myopic and emmetropic children grew older. Conversely, the <e>lens</e> thinned at younger ages and thickened at older ages for all except the persistently hyperopic children. CONCLUSIONS: In young Asian children, the axial length and vitreous chamber depth increased, but the elongation slowed with age. There was a U-shaped growth curve for lens thickness and an inverted U-shaped curve for anterior chamber depth. The findings of early lens thinning followed by thickening suggest a two-phase growth of the lens.",M3
19875653,"Heritabilities of ocular biometrical traits in two croatian isolates with extended pedigrees.PURPOSE: To assess the effects of body stature and years of education, in addition to age and sex, on six oculometric traits and to estimate the heritabilities of these quantitative traits in two Croatian cross-population studies. METHODS: Adult subjects living on the two Croatian islands of Vis and Korcula were recruited for a large epidemiologic and genetic study that included eye biometry, keratometry, and autorefraction. Effects and heritabilities were estimated by using general linear mixed models for axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), corneal curvature (CC), corneal thickness (CT), <e>lens</e> thickness (LT), and spherical equivalent refraction (SER). Both cohorts were genotyped with dense SNP arrays, allowing the use of kinship coefficients derived from genotypic data (realized kinship) rather than from pedigree information (expected kinship). RESULTS: Across cohorts, body mass index (BMI) did not consistently influence any of the ocular traits adjusted for age and/or sex, whereas height and years in education (YrEd) did, explaining up to an additional 5% of the variance (in CC). CT was the trait least influenced by covariates. Estimated heritabilities in Vis and Korcula, respectively, were 84% and 52% for CC, 75% and 71% for CT, 37% and 32% for LT, 59% and 45% for ACD, 37% and 74% for AL, and 0% and 17% for SER. CONCLUSIONS: While heritabilities of CT and CC seemed uniformly high across studies of Caucasian datasets, estimates for SER varied widely and were at the lower end of the spectrum of published observations in our study.",M3
