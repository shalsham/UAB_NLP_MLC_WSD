20464967,"[Antioxidant and prooxidant properties of the ascorbic acid, dihydroquercetine and mexidol in the radical reactions induced by the ionizing radiation and chemical reagents]Antioxidant and prooxidant properties of dihydroquercetine, mexidol and an ascorbic acid in reactions with participation of radicals <e>OH</e>* and O2(-)*, induced by gamma-irradiation, iron-catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and oxidation of reduced NADH by phenazine metosulfate are investigafed. The efficiency of scavenging of radicals OH* estimated by the results of the analysis of deoxyribose degradation, and the efficiency of scavenging of superoxide anion-radicals O2(-)* is estimated by the results of the analysis of occurrence the reduced nitrotetrazolium blue. The concentrations of analyzed compounds, scavenging on 50% (C50%) formation of radicals OH* and O2(-)* are certain. It is shown, that an ascorbic acid, dihydroquercetine and mexidol decrease the generating of superoxide anion-radicals O2(-)* in the gamma-irradiated solutions of sodium format and at oxidation of reduced NADH by phenazine metosulfate scavanged of superoxide anion-radicals O2(-)*. In the gamma-irradiated saline solutions an ascorbic acid, dihydroquercetine and mexidol protected deoxyribose from oxidizing action of hydroxyl radicals OH*. However at presence Fe(3+), EDTA and hydrogen peroxide addition of an ascorbic acid (0.1 mmol/l) increased generating of hydroxyl radicals OH* and in 2.8 times raised the maintenance of products of deoxyribose oxidation, reacting with thiobarbituric acid. Prooxidant action of an ascorbic acid is observed as well in absence of hydrogen peroxide. Obtained data testify that in various modelling systems reagents, in particular ions of iron, and the formed active intermediate products render significant influence on scavenging efficiency of investigated compounds.",M1
20457934,"Single-base resolution mapping of H1-nucleosome interactions and 3D organization of the nucleosome.Despite the key role of the linker histone H1 in chromatin structure and dynamics, its location and interactions with nucleosomal DNA have not been elucidated. In this work we have used a combination of electron cryomicroscopy, hydroxyl radical footprinting, and nanoscale modeling to analyze the structure of precisely positioned mono-, di-, and trinucleosomes containing physiologically assembled full-length histone H1 or truncated mutants of this protein. Single-base resolution *<e>OH</e> footprinting shows that the globular domain of histone H1 (GH1) interacts with the DNA minor groove located at the center of the nucleosome and contacts a 10-bp region of DNA localized symmetrically with respect to the nucleosomal dyad. In addition, GH1 interacts with and organizes about one helical turn of DNA in each linker region of the nucleosome. We also find that a seven amino acid residue region (121-127) in the COOH terminus of histone H1 was required for the formation of the stem structure of the linker DNA. A molecular model on the basis of these data and coarse-grain DNA mechanics provides novel insights on how the different domains of H1 interact with the nucleosome and predicts a specific H1-mediated stem structure within linker DNA.",M1
20420450,"Products and mechanisms of the gas-phase reactions of <e>OH</e> radicals with 1-octene and 7-tetradecene in the presence of NO.Products of the gas-phase reactions of OH radicals with 1-octene and 7-tetradecene have been investigated at 296 +/- 2 K and atmospheric pressure of air, using gas chromatography, direct air sampling atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry, and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. We observe the hydroxynitrate(s) formed from reaction of the hydroxyalkylperoxy radicals with NO; heptanal and 4-hydroxyhexanal from decomposition of the 1,2-hydroxyoctoxy and 7-hydroxy-8-tetradecoxy radicals; and dihydroxynitrates and dihydroxycarbonyls formed after isomerization of the intermediate 1,2-hydroxyalkoxy radicals. Formic acid formation was also observed from the 1-octene reaction, in approximately 3% yield. In the presence of approximately 1.5 x 10(14) molecules cm(-3) of NO, the respective molar formation yields of heptanal and 4-hydroxyhexanal were 28 +/- 3% and 4% from 1-octene, and 86 +/- 11% and 6% from 7-tetradecene. The 4-hydroxyhexanal yield increased with increasing NO concentration, and we attribute 4-hydroxyhexanal + HC(O)OH formation to a minor pathway of the RC(*)HOH + O(2) reaction in the presence of NO. The reaction pathways occurring are discussed.",M1
20397700,"Stability of water-stable C60 clusters to <e>OH</e> radical oxidation and hydrated electron reduction.Reactions of water-stable C(60) clusters (nC(60)) in water with OH radicals (*OH) and hydrated electrons (e(aq)(-)), generated by steady-state gamma-radiation, were observed and characterized. Ordered C(60) clusters were relatively recalcitrant to highly reactive *OH and e(aq)(-) species, with only a fraction of carbons oxidized and reduced, respectively. Pulse radiolysis suggested that the reactions of nC(60) with OH* and e(aq)(-) were diffusion limited, with rate constants of (7.34 +/- 0.31) x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) and (2.34 +/- 0.02) x 10(10) M(-1) s(-1), respectively. Quantum mechanical calculations of binding energy of the C(60)-OH adduct as a function of C(60) clustering degree indicate, despite an initial fast reaction, a slower overall conversion due to thermodynamic instability of C(60)-OH intermediates. The results imply that ordered clustering of C(60) in the aqueous phase significantly hinders C(60)'s fundamental reactivity with radical species.",M1
20392084,"Reaction of ozone with hydrogen peroxide (peroxone process): a revision of current mechanistic concepts based on thermokinetic and quantum-chemical considerations.The reaction of ozone with the anion of H(2)O(2) (peroxone process) gives rise to (*)<e>OH</e> radicals (Staehelin, J.; Hoigne, J. Environ. Sci. Technol. 1982, 16, 676-681). Thermokinetic considerations now suggest that the electron transfer originally assumed as the first step has to be replaced by the formation of an adduct, HO(2)(-) + O(3) --&gt; HO(5)(-) (DeltaG degrees = -39.8 kJ mol(-1)). This decomposes into HO(2)(*) and O(3)(*-) (DeltaG(0) = 13.2 kJ mol(-1)). HO(2)(*) is in equilibrium with O(2)(*-) + H(+), and O(2)(*-) undergoes electron transfer to O(3) giving rise to further O(3)(*-). The decay of O(3)(*-) into (*)OH is now discussed on the basis of the equilibria O(3)(*-) right arrow over left arrow O(2) + O(*-) and O(*-) + H(2)O right arrow over left arrow (*)OH + OH(-), excluding HO(3)(*) as the intermediate originally assumed. To account for the observation of the peroxone process being only 50% efficient, the decay of HO(5)(-) into 2 O(2) + OH(-) (DeltaG(0) = -197 kJ mol(-1)) is proposed to compete with the decay into HO(2)(*) and O(3)(*-).",M1
20381693,"Evaluation of chemiluminescence reagents for selective detection of reactive oxygen species.In order to evaluate the chemiluminescence (CL) reagents for selective detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we comprehensively measured the CL responses of 20 CL reagents (three luminol derivatives, two imidazopyrazinone derivatives, eight lophine derivatives, six acridinium ester derivatives and lucigenin) against six types of ROS (superoxide anion: O(2)(*-), hydroxyl radical: *<e>OH</e>, hydrogen peroxide: H(2)O(2), hypochlorite anion: ClO(-), singlet oxygen: (1)O(2), and nitric oxide: NO). As a result of the screening, it was found that nine CL reagents selectively detected O(2)(*-) while one CL reagent selectively detected *OH. However, no CL reagent had selectivity on the detection of H(2)O(2), ClO(-), (1)O(2) and NO. Our screening results could help to select the most suitable CL reagent for selective determination of different ROS. As an application study, 4-methoxyphenyl-10-methylacridinium-9-carboxylate (MMAC), one of the acridinium ester derivatives, showed high selectivity on the detection of O(2)(*-), and thus was applied to the assay of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The dynamic range and detection limit of the developed CL assay were 0.1-10 and 0.06 U mL(-1), respectively. Significant correlation (r=0.997) was observed between the results by the CL assay using MMAC and the spectrophotometric assay using 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt.",M1
20369811,"Primary steps in the reaction of <e>OH</e> radicals with peptide systems: perspective from a study of model amides.This study reports on an ab initio investigation into the effects of radical attack on peptide backbones using eight model amides. The eight model amides are divided into two subcategories, formamide and acetamide. Within each subcategory, there are four unique systems which include the parent, cis and trans methyl, and the dimethyl structures. The mechanism for hydrogen abstraction shows alpha-C abstraction is kinetically and thermodynamically favorable for all formamide systems. The addition of a methyl group on the nitrogen results in a secondary competitive pathway at the gamma-C site. In the parent acetamide, beta-abstraction is preferred. The addition of a methyl group on the amino group of acetamide results in the introduction of a secondary pathway that will outcompete beta-abstraction, both thermodynamically and kinetically. For all systems, H-abstraction off the nitrogen is the least preferred path. With the addition of a methyl group on the nitrogen, H-abstraction off the nitrogen becomes more favorable. To explain site preference, geometry structures and stabilizations are examined. The results of this study have implications for future studies on radical attack of peptide and protein systems.",M1
20368458,"Atmospheric chemistry in volcanic plumes.Recent field observations have shown that the atmospheric plumes of quiescently degassing volcanoes are chemically very active, pointing to the role of chemical cycles involving halogen species and heterogeneous reactions on aerosol particles that have previously been unexplored for this type of volcanic plumes. Key features of these measurements can be reproduced by numerical models such as the one employed in this study. The model shows sustained high levels of reactive bromine in the plume, leading to extensive ozone destruction, that, depending on plume dispersal, can be maintained for several days. The very high concentrations of sulfur dioxide in the volcanic plume reduces the lifetime of the <e>OH</e> radical drastically, so that it is virtually absent in the volcanic plume. This would imply an increased lifetime of methane in volcanic plumes, unless reactive chlorine chemistry in the plume is strong enough to offset the lack of OH chemistry. A further effect of bromine chemistry in addition to ozone destruction shown by the model studies presented here, is the oxidation of mercury. This relates to mercury that has been coemitted with bromine from the volcano but also to background atmospheric mercury. The rapid oxidation of mercury implies a drastically reduced atmospheric lifetime of mercury so that the contribution of volcanic mercury to the atmospheric background might be less than previously thought. However, the implications, especially health and environmental effects due to deposition, might be substantial and warrant further studies, especially field measurements to test this hypothesis.",M1
20361769,"<e>OH</e> radical initiated oxidation of 1,3-butadiene: isomeric selective study of the dominant addition channel.We report the first isomeric selective kinetic study of the dominant isomeric pathway in the OH initiated oxidation of 1,3-butadiene in the presence of O(2) and NO using the laser photolysis-laser induced fluorescence (LP-LIF) technique. The photodissociation of the precursor 2-iodo-but-3-en-1-ol results exclusively in the dominant OH-butadiene addition product, permitting important insight into the OH initiated oxidation mechanism. On the basis of analysis of the time dependent OH/OD signals, we have determined a rate constant for O2 addition to the hydroxyalkyl radical of 7.0(-3.0)(+7.0) x 10(-13) cm(3) s(-1), and we find a value of 1.5(-0.6)(+1.0) x 10(-11) cm(3) s(-1) for the overall reaction rate constant of the hydroxy peroxy radical with NO. We also report the first clear experimental evidence of the (E) form of the delta-hydroxyalkoxy channel through isotopic labeling experiments and provide an upper bound of 13 +/- 5% to its branching ratio. This species provides a mechanistic pathway for the formation of 4-hydroxy-2-butenal, which has been identified as a first generation end product. This isomeric selective kinetic study, together with a previous study on the minor channel of the 1,3-butadiene oxidation, yields a comprehensive picture of butadiene oxidation under high NOx conditions relevant to most regions in the continental US.",M1
20355118,"Scirpusin A, a hydroxystilbene dimer from Xinjiang wine grape, acts as an effective singlet oxygen quencher and DNA damage protector.BACKGROUND: Grapes and red wines are rich sources of phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins, catechins, flavonols and stilbenes, most of which are potent antioxidants showing cardioprotective properties. We first isolated scirpusin A, a hydroxystilbene dimer, from a wine grape of Xinjiang, and studied its antioxidant activity. RESULTS: Reactive oxygen species scavenging effects and the protection against reactive singlet oxygen-induced DNA damage of scirpusin A have been investigated in our experiments. The concentration of scirpusin A required to inhibit 50% of (1)O(2) generation was 17 micromol L(-1), while addition of scirpusin A at 140 micromol L(-1) caused complete inhibition. Further kinetic study revealed that the reaction of Scirpusin A with singlet oxygen has an extremely high rate constant (k(a) = 4.68 x 10(9) L mol(-1) s(-1)). Scirpusin A (140 micromol L(-1)) exhibited significant inhibition effects on pBR322 DNA breakage. However, scavenging effects of scirpusin A on superoxide anion O(2) (*-) and hydroxyl radical .<e>OH</e> were not potent as the inhibitor rates at a concentration of 1400 micromol L(-1) were 28.83% and 19.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that scirpusin A is a selective quencher of singlet oxygen and a protector against reactive singlet oxygen-induced pBR322 DNA damage at very low concentrations.",M1
20352738,"Preparation and characterization of a new hydrophilic C60 derivative (<e>OH</e>)16C60CHCOOH.C60 and its derivatives are very important nanomaterials in biological and materials science. Unfortunately, due to the high hydrophobicity of the C60 cage, most of these materials are insoluble in water and their usages are quitely restricted. Here we reported the preparation and characterization of (OH)16C60CHCOOH, a new multihydroxylated methanofullerene carboxylic acid (MMFCA) derivative with high aqueous solubility. The elementary analysis, FT-IR and 1HNMR confirmed the structure of this material. Like other C60 and its derivatives, this new derivative also contains the free radical scavenging ability, measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) test. On the other hand, the MTT assay showed it had low cytotoxicity. Therefore, this new MMFCA derivative might be a potential vehicle for the introduction of hydrophobic C60 derivatives into water or a hydrophilic environment.",M1
20345179,"Comparison of alkylnitronaphthalenes formed in NO3 and <e>OH</e> radical-initiated chamber reactions with those observed in ambient air.Nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs) are potential human carcinogens and it has been postulated that their abundance profiles in ambient air in polluted urban areas are influenced by formation due to radical-initiated gas-phase reactions of their parent PAH. In this work, the isomer distributions and yields of the nitroarenes formed from the gas-phase reactions of naphthalene and alkylnaphthalenes with NO3 radicals are reported. For the first time, a mixture of ethylnaphthalenes and dimethylnaphthalenes with relative abundances matching those observed in ambient air has been reacted with OH radicals and with NO3 radicals to generate isomer profiles of ethylnitronaphthalenes (ENNs) and dimethylnitronaphthalenes (x,yDMzNNs; where, for example, 2,7-dimethyl-4-nitronaphthalene = 2,7DM4NN) for comparison with ambient samples. The atmospheric formation rates of ENNs/DMNNs from NO3 radical reactions were calculated and the isomers with the highest mass formation rates are 2,7DM4NN, 1,2DM4NN, 2,6DM4NN, 2,6DM1NN, 1,6DM8NN, 2,7DM1NN, 1,6DM5NN, and 2-ethyl-4-nitronaphthalene. From a comparison of the chamber reaction product profiles with ambient air samples, the ratios of 2-methyl-4-nitronaphthalene/1-methyl-5-nitronaphthalene and of 2,7DM4NN/1,7DM5NN are proposed to be sensitive markers of nitroarene formation from NO3 versus OH radical chemistry.",M1
20331298,"Electronically excited and ionized states of the CH2CH2OH radical: a theoretical study.The low lying excited electronic states of the 2-hydroxyethyl radical, CH(2)CH(2)<e>OH</e>, have been investigated theoretically in the range 5-7 eV by using coupled-cluster and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster methods. Both dissociation and isomerization pathways are identified. On the ground electronic potential energy surface, two stable conformers and six saddle points at energies below approximately 900 cm(-1) are characterized. Vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths for the lowest-lying excited valence state and the 3s, 3p(x), 3p(y), and 3p(z) Rydberg states have been calculated and it is predicted that the absorption spectrum at approximately 270-200 nm should be featureless. The stable conformers and saddle points differ primarily in their two dihedral coordinates, labeled d(HOCC) (OH torsion around CO), and d(OCCH) (CH(2) torsion around CC). Vertical ionization from the ground-state conformers and saddle points leads to an unstable structure of the open-chain CH(2)CH(2)OH(+) cation. The ion isomerizes promptly either to the 1-hydroxyethyl ion, CH(3)CHOH(+), or to the cyclic oxirane ion, CH(2)(OH)CH(2) (+), and the Rydberg states are expected to display a similar behavior. The isomerization pathway depends on the d(OCCH) angle in the ground state. The lowest valence state is repulsive and its dissociation along the CC, CO, and CH bonds, which leads to CH(2)+CH(2)OH, CH(2)CH(2)+OH, and H+CH(2)CHOH, should be prompt. The branching ratio among these channels depends sensitively on the dihedral angles. Surface crossings among Rydberg and valence states and with the ground state are likely to affect dissociation as well. It is concluded that the proximity of several low-lying excited electronic states, which can either dissociate directly or via isomerization and predissociation pathways, would give rise to prompt dissociation leading to several simultaneous dissociation channels.",M1
20235498,"The conical intersection dominates the generation of tropospheric hydroxyl radicals from NO2 and H2O.In the present work, we report a quantitative understanding on how to generate hydroxyl radicals from NO(2) and H(2)O in the troposphere upon photoexcitation at 410 nm by using multiconfigurational perturbation theory and density functional theory. The conical intersections dominate the nonadiabatic relaxation processes after NO(2) irradiated at approximately 410 nm in the troposphere and further control the generation of <e>OH</e> radical by means of hydrogen abstraction. In agreement with two-component fluorescence observed by laser techniques, there are two different photophysical relaxation channels along decreasing and increasing O-N-O angle of NO(2). In the former case, the conical intersection between B(2)B(1) and A(2)B(2) (CI ((2)B(2)/(2)B(1)) first funnels NO(2) out of the Franck-Condon region of B(2)B(1) and relaxes to the A(2)B(2) surface. Following the primary relaxation, the conical intersection between A(2)B(2) and X(2)A(1) (CI((2)B(2)/(2)A(1))) drives NO(2) to decay into highly vibrationally excited X(2)A(1) state that is more than 20,000 cm(-1) above zeroth-order |n(1),n(2),n(3) = 0 vibrational level. In the latter case, increasing the O-N-O angle leads NO(2) to relax to a minimum of B(2)B(1) with a linear O-N-O arrangement. This minimum point is also funnel region between B(2)B(1) and X(2)A(1) (CI((2)B(1)/(2)A(1))) and leads NO(2) to relax into a highly vibrationally excited X(2)A(1) state. The high energetic level of vibrationally excited state has enough energy to overcome the barrier of hydrogen abstraction (40-50 kcal/mol) from water vapor, producing OH ((2)Pi(3/2)) radicals. The collision between NO(2) and H(2)O molecules not only is a precondition of hydrogen abstraction but induces the faster internal conversion (CIIC) via conical intersections. The faster internal conversion favors more energy transfer from electronically excited states into highly vibrationally excited X(2)A(1) states. The collision (i.e., the heat motion of molecules) functions as the trigger and accelerator in the generation of OH radicals from NO(2) and H(2)O in the troposphere.",M1
20229985,"Sonolytic decomposition of aqueous bioxalate in the presence of ozone.Ultrasonic irradiation in the presence of ozone is demonstrated to be effective for the rapid oxidation of oxalic acid, bioxalate, and oxalate (H(2)C(2)O(4)/HC(2)O(4)(-)/C(2)O(4)(2-)) in aqueous solution to CO(2) and H(2)O. The degradation rate of bioxalate exposed to  sonozone  (i.e., simultaneous ultrasonication and ozonolysis) was found to be 16-times faster than predicted by the linear addition of ozonolysis and ultrasonic irradiation rates. The hydroxyl radical (*<e>OH</e>) is the only oxy-radical produced that can oxidize oxalate on a relevant time-scale. Thus, plausible *OH production mechanisms are evaluated to explain the observed kinetic synergism of ultrasonication and ozonolysis toward bioxalate decomposition. *OH production via decomposition of O(3) in the cavitating bubble vapor and via the reaction of O(3) and H(2)O(2) are considered, but kinetic estimations and experimental evidence indicate neither to be a sufficient source of *OH. A free-radical chain mechanism is proposed in which the HC(2)O(4)(-) + *OH reaction functions as a primary propagation step, while the termination occurs through the O(3) + CO(2)(*-) reaction via an O-atom transfer mechanism. Kinetic simulations confirm that ozone reacts efficiently with the superoxide (O(2)(*-)) ion that is produced by the reaction of O(2) and CO(2)(*-) to form *OH radical, and that the reaction of O(3) + CO(2)(*-) must be chain terminating. Oxalate is also readily oxidized by  peroxone  treatment (i.e., H(2)O(2) and O(3)). However, the addition of H(2)O(2) during the course of the sonolytic ozonation of oxalic acid does not appear to increase the observed degradation rate and decreases rates at millimolar levels.",M1
20220252,"Influence of anionic surfactant on the process of electro-Fenton decolorized methyl orange.The electro-Fenton process has been shown to be very successful to remove dyes from water. However, the influence of other constituents in dyeing industry wastewater, such as Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) surfactants, has not been investigated. In this study, the effect of SDS surfactant on the kinetics of Methyl Orange degradation undergoing Electro-Fenton process was investigated. Results show that Methyl Orange degradation rate decreased as SDS concentration (below Critical Micelle Concentration, CMC) increased, which was attributed to the consumption of hydroxyl radicals (( )<e>OH</e>) by surfactants. The kinetics modeling indicates the reaction was the first-order reaction to Methyl Orange even SDS existing. The pseudo first-order rate constants decreased as SDS concentration increased.",M1

Mononuclear planar Ni(II) complexes [Ni(pyN(2)(Me2))L](1-) (pyN(2)(Me2) = bis(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-2,6-pyridinedicarboxamidate(2-)) derived from a NNN pincer ligand have been prepared including L = OH(-) (1) and CN(-) (7). Complex 1 reacts with ethyl formate and CO(2) to form unidentate L = HCO(2)(-) (5) and HCO(3)(-) (6) products. A binucleating macrocycle was prepared which specifically binds Ni(II) at a NNN pincer site and five-coordinate Fe(II) at a triamine site. The Ni(II) macrocyle forms hydroxo (14) and cyanide complexes (15) analogous to 1 and 7.

The Ni(II)Fe(II) complexes, lacking appropriate Ni-Fe-S cluster structures, are not site analogues, but their synthesis and reactivity provide the first demonstration that molecular Ni(II)...Fe(II) sites and bridges can be attained, a necessity in the biomimetic chemistry of C-clusters.",M1
20202668,"Detoxification and degradation of microcystin-LR and -RR by ozonation.In the present study, two Microsystins (MCs) of Microcystin-LR and Microcystin-RR were degraded with different dosages of ozone (O(3)). The possible degradation pathways were elucidated by analyzing their intermediates and end-products with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method. The toxicity of the MCs ozonation products was also evaluated by assaying the protein phosphatase inhibition in vitro and acute toxicity in vivo. Results demonstrated that ozonation was a promising technology for removal and detoxification of the cyanotoxins. The MCs destruction was mainly involved in the attack of ozone on Adda side chain. First, the conjugated diene structure of Adda moiety was attacked by hydroxyl radical (<e>OH</e>()) to produce dihydroxylated products, then the hydroxylated 4-5 and/or 6-7 bond of Adda was cleaved into aldehyde or ketone peptide residues, and finally the residues were oxidized into the corresponding carboxylic acids. The fragmentation of the Mdha-Ala peptide bond of MCs also contributed positively to the oxidation process. Additionally, the attack on the benzene ring of Adda side chain was exclusively observed during MC-RR degradation. The toxicity evaluation of MCs ozonation products revealed that those end-products had no adverse effects in vivo and in vitro ozonation that could completely remove the MCs' toxicity.",M1
20196567,"Plasma induced oxidative cleavage of disulfide bonds in polypeptides during nanoelectrospray ionization.Cleavage of the disulfide bond within a polypeptide was observed when the nanoelectrospray (nanoESI) plume of a peptide solution interacted with a low-temperature helium plasma in air. Online mass spectrometric analysis revealed that chain separation accompanied by a mass increase of 1 or 16 Da for each chain was common to peptides having an interchain disulfide bond, while for peptides having intrachain disulfide bonds, the reaction products typically showed mass increases of 17 Da. Experimental results suggested that hydroxyl radicals initiated from the plasma were likely to be responsible via dissociative addition to the disulfide bond (RSSR'), giving rise to RSH and R'SO*. When the hydroxyl radical addition product ions ([M + nH + <e>OH</e>](n*+), n is the charge state) generated from peptides having intrachain peptides were subjected to collision-induced dissociation (CID) in an ion trap, a-, b-, and y-type sequence ions within the cyclic structure defined by the disulfide bond were observed in addition to the exocyclic cleavages typically seen from CID of [M + nH](n+) peptide ions. Rich structural information could thus be obtained. These findings were demonstrated in 14 peptides containing disulfide bonds and further by bovine insulin, which has three disulfide bonds. Collisional activation of the [M + 5H + OH](5*+) insulin ions provided 76% of the possible backbone cleavages as compared to 26% acquired from CID of the [M + 5H](5+) ions.",M1
20155378,"Oligonucleotides are potent antioxidants acting primarily through metal ion chelation.We report on a rather unknown feature of oligonucleotides, namely, their potent antioxidant activity. Previously, we showed that nucleotides are potent antioxidants in Fe(II)/Cu(I/II)-H(2)O(2) systems. Here, we explored the potential of 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides as inhibitors of the Fe(II)/Cu(I/II)-induced *<e>OH</e> formation from H(2)O(2). The oligonucleotides [d(A)(5,7,20); d(T)(20); (2'-OMe-A)(5)] proved to be highly potent antioxidants with IC(50) values of 5-17 or 48-85 microM in inhibiting Fe(II)/Cu(I)- or Cu(II)-induced H(2)O(2) decomposition, respectively, thus representing a 40-215-fold increase in potency as compared with Trolox, a standard antioxidant. The antioxidant activity is only weakly dependent on the oligonucleotides' length or base identity. We analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and (1)H-NMR spectroscopy the composition of the d(A)(5) solution exposed to the aforementioned oxidative conditions for 4 min or 24 h. We concluded that the primary (rapid) inhibition mechanism by oligonucleotides is metal ion chelation and the secondary (slow) mechanism is radical scavenging. We characterized the Cu(I)-d(A)(5) and Cu(II)-d(A)(7) complexes by (1)H-NMR and (31)P-NMR or frozen-solution ESR spectroscopy, respectively. Cu(I) is probably coordinated to d(A)(5) via N1 and N7 of two adenine residues and possibly also via two phosphate/bridging water molecules. The ESR data suggest Cu(II) chelation through two nitrogen atoms of the adenine bases and two oxygen atoms (phosphates or water molecules). We conclude that oligonucleotides at micromolar concentrations prevent Fe(II)/Cu(I/II)-induced oxidative damage, primarily through metal ion chelation. Furthermore, we propose the use of a short, metabolically stable oligonucleotide, (2'-OMe-A)(5), as a highly potent and relatively long lived (t(1/2) approximately 20 h) antioxidant.",M1
20151384,"Component analysis and free radical-scavenging potential of Panax notoginseng and Carthamus tinctorius extracts.Panax notoginseng and Carthamus tinctorius are known as traditional medicinal plants, and they also have edible values. To better understand their pharmacological mechanism, the present study assessed the in vitro antioxidant activities of extracts of P. notoginseng (EPN) and C. tinctorius (ECT). In addition, the main components of EPN and ECT were determined by HPLC. The results show that EPN mainly contained saponins, which were effective in scavenging (.)<e>OH</e> and O(.)(2-), while showing a low activity in the DPPH(.) assay. Flavonoids were the main components of ECT and were active in scavenging all three radicals in a dose-dependent manner. In brief, the antioxidant properties of EPN and ECT are distinct and might be complementary, their combined use tending to be more effective in scavenging (.)OH (P&lt;0.05 vs. EPN or ECT).",M1
20140800,"Antioxidant properties and principal phenolic phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants from Asclepiadoideae and Periplocoideae.The subfamily Asclepiadoideae (Apocynaceae) and the closely-related Periplocoideae are sources of many indigenous Indian medicinal plants. We surveyed antioxidant properties and total phenolic and flavonoid contents of 15 samples, representing 12 Indian medicinal plant species from these subfamilies. Total antioxidant assay was performed using the 2,2-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid and ferric-reducing antioxidant power methods. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were measured using colourimetric methods. Principal phenolic compounds were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The highest antioxidant capacity and high levels of total phenolics and flavonoids were found in the leaves of Decalepis hamiltonii. The stems of Sarcostemma brevistigma exhibited the highest xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory activity. The roots of Hemidesmus indicus showed the highest <e>OH</e>(-) radical scavenging activity. In general, Periplocoideae members exhibited higher antioxidant activity than Asclepiadoideae members. The highly significant and positive correlations (R &gt; 0.914) between total antioxidant capacity parameters and total phenolic content indicated that the phenolic compounds contributed significantly to the antioxidant activity of the tested plant samples. The principal phenolic phytochemicals from these plants were identified by LC-MS, including flavonoids, phenolic acids and phenolic terpenoids. Chlorogenic acid and rutin were detected in almost all of the plant samples. The LC-MS analysis provided full fingerprints of the principal phenolic compounds in the medicinal plants from these two subfamilies, which are useful for their authentication and quality evaluation.",M1
20131791,"Efficient removal of organic pollutants with magnetic Nanoscaled BiFeO(3) as a reusable heterogeneous fenton-like catalyst.BiFeO(3) magnetic nanoparticles (BFO MNPs) were prepared with a sol-gel method and characterized as a catalyst. It was found that BFO MNPs effectively catalyzed the decomposition of H(2)O(2) into *<e>OH</e> radicals, being confirmed with electron spin resonance spin-trapping technique and other radical probing techniques. The strong H(2)O(2)-activating ability of BFO MNPs showed promising applications in the oxidative degradation of organic pollutants. When BFO MNPs were used as a heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst to degrade Rhodamine B, the apparent rate constant for the RhB degradation at 25 degrees C at pH 5.0 in the BFO MNPs-H(2)O(2) system was evaluated to be 2.89 x 10(-2) min(-1), being about 20 folds of that obtained with Fe(3)O(4) MNPs as the catalyst under similar conditions. Moreover, BFO MNPs were demonstrated to have excellent stability and reusability. The catalytic mechanism of BFO MNPs was also investigated with Monte Carlo simulations and density functional theory calculations.",M1
20129490,"Arsenic trioxide-mediated antiplatelet activity: pivotal role of the phospholipase C gamma 2-protein kinase C-p38 MAPK cascade.Arsenic trioxide produces high rates of complete clinical remission in patients with relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia. Platelet activation is relevant in a variety of acute thrombotic events and coronary heart diseases. Few studies have examined the effects of arsenic trioxide on platelets, and the mechanisms underlying the signaling pathways remain obscure. The aim of this study was to examine systematically the detailed mechanisms of arsenic trioxide in preventing platelet activation. Arsenic trioxide (5 micromol/L) exhibited more potent activity at inhibiting collagen (1 microg/mL)-induced platelet aggregation than other agonists. Arsenic trioxide (15 and 25 micromol/L) inhibited collagen-induced platelet activation accompanied by [Ca(+2)]i mobilization, thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) formation, phospholipase C (PLC)gamma 2 phosphorylation, and protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Arsenic trioxide (15 and 25 micromol/L) did not significantly affect cyclic nucleotide-induced vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation. Moreover, arsenic trioxide markedly inhibited p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but not JNK1/2 or ERK2 phosphorylation in washed platelets. Arsenic trioxide also markedly reduced hydroxyl radical (<e>OH</e>(.)) formation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) study. The most important findings of this study suggest that the inhibitory effect of arsenic trioxide possibly involves inhibition of the PLC gamma 2-PKC-p38 MAPK cascade, thereby leading to inhibition of [Ca(+2)]i or free radical formation, and finally the inhibition of platelet aggregation.",M1
20121059,"Isomer-selective study of the <e>OH</e>-initiated oxidation of isoprene in the presence of O(2) and NO: 2. the major OH addition channel.We report the first isomeric-selective study of the dominant isomeric pathway in the OH-initiated oxidation of isoprene in the presence of O2 and NO using the laser photolysis-laser induced fluorescence (LP-LIF) technique. The photolysis of monodeuterated/nondeuterated 2-iodo-2-methylbut-3-en-1-ol results exclusively in the dominant OH-isoprene addition product, providing important insight into the oxidation mechanism. On the basis of kinetic analysis of OH cycling experiments, we have determined the rate constant for O2 addition to the hydroxyalkyl radical to be 1.0(-0.5)+1.7 x 10(-12) cm3 s(-1), and we find a value of 8.1-2.3+3.4 x 10(-12) cm3 s(-1) for the overall reaction rate constant of the resulting hydroxyperoxy radical with NO. We also report the first clear experimental evidence of the (E) form of the delta-hydroxyalkoxy channel through isotopic labeling experiments and quantify its branching ratio to be (10 +/- 3)%. This puts a rigorous upper limit on the branching of the (E)-delta-hydroxyalkoxy radical channel. Since our measured isomeric-selective rate constants for the dominant outer channel in OH-initiated isoprene chemistry are similar to the overall rate constants derived from nonisomeric kinetics, we predict that the remaining outer addition channel will have similar reactivity.",M1
20114059,"Reduced cellular redox status induces 4-hydroxynonenal-mediated caspase 3 activation leading to erythrocyte death during chronic arsenic exposure in rats.Chronic exposure to arsenic in rats led to gradual accumulation of the toxicant in erythrocytes causing oxidative stress in these cells. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a major aldehyde product of lipid peroxidation, contributed significantly to the cytopathological events observed during oxidative stress in the erythrocytes of exposed rats. 4-HNE triggered death signal cascade that was initiated with the formation of HNE-protein adducts in cytosol. HNE-protein adduct formation resulted in depletion of cytosolic antioxidants followed by increased generation of ROS. Results showed accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) from the early stages of arsenic exposure, while superoxide (O(2)(*-)) and hydroxyl radical ((*)<e>OH</e>) also contributed to the oxidative stress during longer period of exposure. Suppression of antioxidant system coupled with increased generation of ROS eventually led to activation of caspase 3 during arsenic exposure. Attenuation of HNE-mediated activation of caspase 3 in presence of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) indicated the involvement of GSH in the process. Prevention of HNE-mediated degradation of membrane proteins in presence of Z-DEVD-FMK identified caspase 3 as the principal mediator of HNE-induced cellular damage during arsenic exposure. Degradation of band 3 followed by its aggregation on the red cell surface promoted immunologic recognition of redistributed band 3 by autologous IgG with subsequent attachment of C3b. Finally, the formation of C3b-IgG-band 3 immune complex accelerated the elimination of affected cells from circulation and led to the decline of erythrocyte life span during chronic arsenic toxicity.",M1
20112953,"Mechanistic considerations for the advanced oxidation treatment of fluoroquinolone pharmaceutical compounds using TiO(2) heterogeneous catalysis.Pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites are being found in surface and ground waters which is indicative of inefficient removal by conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which utilize free-radical reactions to degrade chemical contaminates, are an alternative to traditional water treatment. Three fluoroquinolone pharmaceutical compounds were studied and the absolute rate constants for hydroxyl radical (*<e>OH</e>) and hydrated electron (e(-)(aq)) are reported. For norfloxacin, levofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, the bimolecular reaction rate constants with *OH were determined as (6.18 +/- 0.18) x 10(9), (7.59 +/- 0.16) x 10(9) and (8.04 +/- 0.62) x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1), and with e(-)(aq) were (1.18 +/- 0.10) x 10(10), (2.46 +/- 0.05) x 10(10) and (2.79 +/- 0.05) x 10(10) M(-1) s(-1), respectively. To provide insights into the chemistry of destruction of these three target pharmaceuticals, transient spectra were obtained for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with the three compounds. Photocatalysis was chosen as a representative advanced oxidation technology to degrade these three fluoroquinolones and their degradation pathways were proposed. Elimination of piperazynilic ring in fluoroquinolone molecules, addition of hydroxyl radical to quinolone ring, and ipso attack at the F atoms on the aromatic ring by hydroxyl radicals occurred. These results indicate that AOPs involving production of *OH radicals are efficiently alternative treatment technologies for degradation of fluoroquinolones in aqueous solution.",M1
20099625,"Efficiency and products investigations on the ozonation of 2-methylisoborneol in drinking water.2-Methylisobomeol (MIB) is a terpenoid produced as a secondary metabolite by some cyanobacteria and actinomycetes and thus can be present in some drinking water source waters. The removal efficiency, products, and degradation pathway of MIB in drinking water by ozonation were studied. The results showed that ozone is efficient in removing MIB from an aqueous solution, regardless of the initial MIB concentration. Hydroxyl radicals (<e>OH</e>) scavenger experiments indicated that hydroxyl radicals are involved in MIB degradation. The degradation products of MIB were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Camphor was identified as a primary degradation product, which was further oxidized to form other degradation intermediates, such as aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids. A possible degradation pathway for the ozonation of MIB was proposed. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the formation of aldehydes was carried out. It was found that six aldehydes are the main aldehydes products of ozonation of MIB, namely formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propanal, butanal, glyoxal, and methyl glyoxal.",M1
20092302,"Kinetic properties for the complete series reactions of chlorophenols with <e>OH</e> radicals-relevance for dioxin formation.The chlorophenoxy radical (CPR) is a key intermediate species in the formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). In municipal waste incinerators, the reactions of chlorophenols with OH radicals play the most central role in the formation of chlorophenoxy radicals. In this paper, molecular orbital theory calculations have been performed to investigate the formation of chlorophenoxy radicals from the complete series reactions of 19 chlorophenol congeners with OH radicals. The single-point energy calculation was carried out at the MPWB1K/6-311+G(3df,2p) level on the basis of the MPWB1K/6-31+G(d,p) optimized geometries. The kinetic modeling of the PCDD/PCDF (PCDD/F for short) formation demands the knowledge of the rate parameters for the formation of chlorophenoxy radicals from chlorophenols. So, the kinetic properties of the reactions of chlorophenols with OH radicals were deduced over a wide temperature range of 600-1200 K using canonical variational transition-state theory (CVT) with small curvature tunneling contribution (SCT). This study shows that the chlorine substitution at the ortho position in chlorophenol not only has a significant effect on the structures of chlorophenols, prereactive intermediates, the transition states, and chlorophenoxy radicals, but also plays a decisive role in determining the rate parameters.",M1

20081251,"Tumor anti-initiating activity of some novel 3,4-dihydropyrimidinones.Halting the tumor initiation process by targeting the inhibition of the carcinogens metabolic activators (CYP), the induction of the carcinogen detoxification enzymes (glutathione-S-transferases, GSTs), and the induction of antioxidant activity is an effective strategy. Since several dihydropyrimidine derivatives (Biginelli compounds) are therapeutically active, the present study aimed to synthesize some dihydropyrimidines with multifunctional aromatic substitutions and to investigate their effects as anti-initiating agents. Twelve compounds were synthesized and structurally elucidated. The results revealed that compound 10 was a non-cytotoxic inhibitor of cytochrome P 450 1A (Cyp1A) activity, inducer of GST activity, scavenger of <e>OH</e> and inhibitor of DNA fragmentation. Compounds 1 and 9 were radical scavengers of OH and inhibitors of DNA fragmentation. On the other hand, all compounds were not toxic against different tumor cells, except compounds 2, 4, and 5 possessed non specific cytotoxicity against both liver and colon carcinoma cells, while 7 possessed specific cytotoxicity only against colon carcinoma cells. Compound 1 was a non-cytotoxic inducer of GST activity, scavenger of OH and ROO, and inhibitor of DNA fragmentation. The present study proved that compounds 10 and 1 were active and safe tumor anti-initiating and multi-potent blocking agent.",M1
20080570,"Yields of beta-hydroxynitrates, dihydroxynitrates, and trihydroxynitrates formed from <e>OH</e> radical-initiated reactions of 2-methyl-1-alkenes.Yields of beta-hydroxynitrates, dihydroxynitrates, and trihydroxynitrates, in particles formed from OH radical-initiated reactions of C(9)-C(15) 2-methyl-1-alkenes in the presence of NO(x) were measured by using a thermal desorption particle beam mass spectrometer coupled to a high-performance liquid chromatograph with a UV-visible (UV-vis) detector. Yields of beta-hydroxynitrates and dihydroxynitrates increased with carbon number primarily due to enhanced gas-to-particle partitioning before reaching plateaus at approximately C(14)-C(15), where the compounds were essentially entirely in the particle phase. Plateau yields of beta-hydroxynitrates, dihydroxynitrates, and trihydroxynitrates were 0.183 +/- 0.005, 0.045 +/- 0.005, and 0.034 +/- 0.005, and, after normalization for OH radical addition to the C = C double bond, were 0.225 +/- 0.007, 0.055 +/- 0.006, and 0.042 +/- 0.006. The fractions of 1-hydroxy and 2-hydroxy beta-hydroxynitrate isomers were 0.90/0.10. Yields measured here and in our previous study of reactions of linear internal alkenes and linear 1-alkenes indicate that, for these alkene classes, the relative branching ratios for forming tertiary, secondary, and primary beta-hydroxyalkyl radicals by OH radical addition to the C=C double bond are 4.3/1.9/1.0, and the branching ratios for forming beta-hydroxynitrates from reactions of tertiary, secondary, and primary beta-hydroxyperoxy radicals with NO are 0.25, 0.15, and 0.12.

20078112,"Oxidation reactions of cytosine DNA components by hydroxyl radical and one-electron oxidants in aerated aqueous solutions.Indirect evidence strongly suggests that oxidation reactions of cytosine and its minor derivative 5-methylcytosine play a major role in mutagenesis and cancer. Therefore, there is an emerging necessity to identify the final oxidation products of these reactions, to search for their formation in cellular DNA, and to assess their mutagenic features. In this Account, we report and discuss the main *<e>OH</e> and one-electron-mediated oxidation reactions, two of the most potent sources of DNA damage, of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine nucleosides that have been recently characterized. The addition of *OH to the 5,6-unsaturated double bond of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine generates final degradation products that resemble those observed for uracil and thymine. The main product from the oxidation of cytosine, cytosine glycol, has been shown to undergo dehydration at a much faster rate as a free nucleoside than when inserted into double-stranded DNA. On the other hand, the predominant *OH addition at C5 of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine leads to the formation of 5-hydroxy-5,6-dihydro radicals that give rise to novel products with an imidazolidine structure. The mechanism of the formation of imidazolidine products is accounted for by rearrangement reactions that in the presence of molecular oxygen likely involve an intermediate pyrimidine endoperoxide. The reactions of the radical cations of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine are governed by competitive hydration, mainly at C6 of the pyrimidine ring, and deprotonation from the exocyclic amino and methyl group, leading in most cases to products similar to those generated by *OH. 5-Hydroxypyrimidines, the dehydration products of cytosine and uracil glycols, have a low oxidation potential, and their one-electron oxidation results in a cascade of decomposition reactions involving the formation of isodialuric acid, dialuric acid, 5-hydroxyhydantoin, and its hydroxyketone isomer. In biology, GC --&gt; AT transitions are the most common mutations in the genome of aerobic organisms, including the lacI gene in bacteria, lacI transgenes in rodents, and the HPRT gene in rodents and humans, so a more complete understanding of cytosine oxidation is an essential research goal. The data and insights presented here shed new light on oxidation reactions of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine and should facilitate their validation in cellular DNA.",M1
20072920,"Cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity assay for antioxidants in human serum and for hydroxyl radical scavengers.Tests measuring the combined antioxidant effect of the nonenzymatic defenses in biological fluids may be useful in providing an index of the organism's capability to counteract reactive species known as pro-oxidants, resist oxidative damage, and combat oxidative stress-related diseases. The selected chromogenic redox reagent for the assay of human serum should be easily accessible, stable, selective, and respond to all types of biologically important antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, reduced glutathione (GSH), uric acid, and bilirubin, regardless of chemical type or hydrophilicity. Our recently developed cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) spectrophotometric method for a number of polyphenols and flavonoids using the copper(II)-neocuproine reagent in ammonium acetate buffer is now applied to a complete series of plasma antioxidants for the assay of total antioxidant capacity of serum, and the resulting absorbance at 450 nm is recorded either directly (e.g., for ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, and glutathione) or after incubation at 50 degrees C for 20 min (e.g., for uric acid, bilirubin, and albumin), quantitation being made by means of a calibration curve. The lipophilic antioxidants, alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, are assayed in dichloromethane. Lipophilic antioxidants of serum are extracted with n-hexane from an ethanolic solution of serum subjected to centrifugation. Hydrophilic antioxidants of serum are assayed in the centrifugate after perchloric acid precipitation of proteins. The CUPRAC molar absorptivities, linear ranges, and TEAC (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) coefficients of the serum antioxidants are established, and the results are evaluated in comparison with the findings of the ABTS/TEAC reference method. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) are 0.7 and 1.5%, respectively, for serum. The CUPRAC assay proved to be efficient for glutathione and thiol-type antioxidants, for which the FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant potency) test is basically nonresponsive. The additivity of absorbances of all the tested antioxidants confirmed that antioxidants in the CUPRAC test do not chemically interact among each other so as to cause an intensification or quenching of the theoretically expected absorbance, and that a total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assay of serum is possible. As a distinct advantage over other electron-transfer based assays (e.g., Folin, FRAP, ABTS, DPPH), CUPRAC is superior in regard to its realistic pH close to the physiological pH, favorable redox potential, accessibility and stability of reagents, and applicability to lipophilic antioxidants as well as hydrophilic ones. The CUPRAC procedure can also assay hydroxyl radicals, being the most reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a more convenient, efficient, and less costly alternative to HPLC/electrochemical detection techniques and to the nonspecific, low-yield TBARS test, we use p-aminobenzoate, 2,4- and 3,5-dimethoxybenzoate probes for detecting hydroxyl radicals generated from an equivalent mixture of [Fe(II)+EDTA] with hydrogen peroxide. The produced hydroxyl radicals attack both the probe and the water-soluble antioxidants in 37 degrees C-incubated solutions for 2 h. The CUPRAC absorbance of the ethylacetate extract due to the reduction of Cu(II)-neocuproine reagent by the hydroxylated probe decreases in the presence of (.)<e>OH</e> scavengers, the difference being proportional to the scavenging ability of the tested compound. The developed method is less lengthy, more specific, and of a higher yield than the classical TBARS assay.",M1
20055515,"Kinetic model of the H(2)O(2)-SCN(-)-<e>OH</e>(-)-Cu(2+) oscillator and its application to the interpretation of the potentiometric responses of various inert electrodes monitoring the reaction course.The high complexity of the kinetic mechanism of the H(2)O(2)-SCN(-)-OH(-)-Cu(2+) oscillator, involving numerous intermediates, causes the oscillations monitored potentiometrically with gold or glassy carbon electrodes to exhibit opposite phases compared with the oscillations recorded with palladium or platinum electrodes. Following our previous work on the outline explanation of these phenomena, involving the concept of the mixed potential, in this paper, we present their more detailed and advanced study. For that purpose, we built up a simplified but realistic kinetic model of the studied oscillator, involving nine intermediates. Of those nine species, Cu(OH)(3)(-), Cu(OH)(2)(-), and HO(2)(*) were found to be crucial for the explanation of the potentiometric responses of various electrodes, under an additional assumption that the interfacial exchange current density of the HO(2)(*)/HO(2)(-) couple increases in the series GC &lt; Au &lt; Pt. Calculated oscillatory variations of the mixed potential for various model electrodes, compared with experimental results, allowed us to conclude that the potentiometric oscillations are caused largely by the oscillations of the [Cu(OH)(3)(-)]/[Cu(OH)(2)(-)] concentration ratio, irrespective of the electrode material used as a potentiometric sensor. For the Au electrode, the increase of the potential within every oscillatory peak largely reflects the increase in the [Cu(OH)(3)(-)]/[Cu(OH)(2)(-)] ratio. The simultaneous shift of the relatively high Pt electrode potential toward more negative equilibrium potential of the Cu(OH)(3)(-)/Cu(OH)(2)(-) couple is caused by the increase of the exchange current density of the latter couple. Thus, even the opposite phases of the potentiometric oscillations are explainable in terms of the oscillatory behavior of the same redox couple. Understanding of such phenomena is crucial for the proper interpretation of potentiometric data in complex chemical systems.",M1

From the spectra, internal energies of OH and translational energy releases to products were determined. The electronic transition at 212 nm responsible for the OH dissociation was assigned as the pi(C[triple bond]C) --&gt; pi*(C[triple bond]C) transition by time-dependent density functional theory calculations. In addition, an energy barrier at the exit channel along the reaction coordinate on the excited electronic potential energy surface was identified by ab initio calculations. The observed energy partitioning among the fragments was successfully modeled by the so-called  barrier-impulsive model .",M1
20045940,"Effects of a calcium-channel blocker (CV159) on hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats: evaluation with selective NO/pO2 electrodes and an electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trapping method.Nitric oxide (NO) and the partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) in the liver were simultaneously quantified in rats with partial hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (PHIRI). Real-time NO/pO(2) monitoring and immunohistochemical analysis for superoxide dismutase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) were performed to evaluate the protective effects of a dihydropyridine-type calcium-channel blocker--CV159--on PHIRI. Serum high-mobility-group box-1 (HMGB-1) was measured to assess cellular necrosis. Moreover, we used in vitro/ex vivo electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping to assess the hydroxyl radical (*<e>OH</e>)-scavenging activity (OHSA) of CV159 and the liver tissue. The NO levels were significantly higher in CV159-treated rats than in control rats throughout the ischemic phase. Immediately after reperfusion, the levels temporarily increased in waves and then gradually decreased in the treated rats but remained constant in the control rats. pO(2) was continually higher in the treated rats. In these rats, hepatic eNOS expression increased, whereas iNOS expression decreased. The treated rats exhibited significantly higher cytosolic and mitochondrial concentrations NOx (NO(2)+NO(3)). The serum HMGB-1 levels significantly decreased in the treated rats. Moreover, CV159 directly scavenged *OH and both mitochondrial and cytosolic OHSA were preserved in the treated rats. Thus, CV159-mediated inhibition of intracellular Ca(2+) overloading may effectively minimize organ damage and also have *OH-scavenging activity and the cytoprotective effects of eNOS-derived NO.",M1

Tin chloride hydrolysis was achieved using NaOH or NH(4)<e>OH</e> aqueous solutions, at pH around 9, followed by the conversion into corresponding hydroxides through calcinations. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (UV-DR) methods confirmed the structure of as-synthesized solids.

The as-synthesized materials were used for photocatalytic studies showing a good activity for methylene blue decolourization, which varies with SnO(2) content and used as a hydrolysing agent. The proposed mechanism is based on the shifting of flat band potential of SnO(2) due to the interaction with Mg/Al-LDH, this being energetically favourable to the formation of hydroxyl radicals responsible for methylene blue degradation.",M1
20036906,"Nitroxyl enhances myocyte Ca2+ transients by exclusively targeting SR Ca2+-cycling.Nitroxyl (HNO), the 1-electron reduction product of nitric oxide, improves myocardial contraction in normal and failing hearts. Here we test whether the HNO donor Angeli's salt (AS) will change myocyte action potential (AP) waveform by altering the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa) and contrast the contractile effects of HNO with that of the hydroxyl radical (.<e>OH</e>) and nitrite (NO2-), two potential breakdown products of AS. We confirmed the positive effect of AS/HNO on basal cardiomyocyte function, as opposed to the detrimental effect of .OH and the negligible effect of NO2-. Upon examination of the myocyte AP, we observed no change in resting membrane potential or AP duration to 20 per cent repolarization with AS/HNO, whereas AP duration to 90 per cent repolarization was slightly prolonged. However, perfusion with AS/HNO did not elicit a change in basal ICa, but did hasten ICa inactivation. Upon further examination of the SR, the AS/HNO-induced increase in cardiomyocyte Ca2+ transients was abolished with inhibition of SR Ca2+-cycling. Therefore, the HNO-induced increase in Ca2+ transients results exclusively from changes in SR Ca2+-cycling, and not from ICa.",M1
20028051,"Yields of glyoxal and ring-cleavage co-products from the <e>OH</e> radical-initiated reactions of naphthalene and selected alkylnaphthalenes.Naphthalene and alkylnaphthalenes are the most abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in ambient air and are transformed mainly by chemical reaction with hydroxyl (OH) radicals during daylight hours. To better understand the reaction mechanisms, we have quantified glyoxal from the OH radical-initiated reactions of naphthalene, 1-methylnaphthalene, 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene, acenaphthene, and acenaphthylene as a function of the NO(2) concentration and, for the naphthalene reaction, also in the absence of NO(2). Glyoxal was formed as a first-generation product from the naphthalene, 1-methylnaphthalene, 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene, and acenaphthene reactions, and its yields were independent of the NO(2) concentration over the ranges employed, being 5% in the presence of NO(2) and 3% in the absence of NO(2) from naphthalene; approximately 3% from 1-methylnaphthalene; approximately 2% from 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene; approximately 10-15% from acenaphthene; and &lt;2% from acenaphthylene. Second-generation formation of glyoxal was evident in the 1-methylnaphthalene, 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene, and acenaphthene reactions. For the naphthalene reaction, our results suggest that the reactions of the OH-naphthalene adducts with NO(2) and O(2) both lead to glyoxal formation in similar yield. Simultaneous measurements of phthaldialdehyde from naphthalene, 2-acetylbenzaldehyde from 1-methylnaphthalene, and 1,2-diacetylbenzene from 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene suggest that these C(n-2)-dicarbonyls are coproducts to glyoxal.",M1
20024170,"Photophysical properties and photodynamic activity of octacationic oxotitanium(IV) phthalocyanines.The photophysical and photosensitizing properties of two octacationic oxotitanium phthalocyanines (TiOPcs), bearing pyridiniomethyl or cholinyl substituents, have been studied in aqueous and alcohol solutions. In water, both compounds were monomeric with the high quantum yields of fluorescence (Phi(F) = 0.17-0.19) and singlet oxygen formation (Phi(Delta) = 0.4-0.5). The Phi(F) and Phi(Delta) of both phthalocyanines decreased with the increase of solvent hydrophobicity from water to ethanol. This effect was much stronger in alcohol solutions of the pyridiniomethyl-substituted phthalocyanine and probably results from aggregation of TiOPc molecules caused by association of chloride anions with phthalocyanine cationic groups. Evidence is presented that under illumination aqueous TiOPc solutions also produce hydroxyl radicals, which probably appear owing to photocleavage of water molecules. The quantum yield of <e>OH</e> formation was (3-5) x 10(-5) after argon purging and twice as much in the presence of air. It is shown that irradiation of TiOPc solutions causes photobleaching of TiOPcs. The photobleaching quantum yield in water was found to be about 1 x 10(-4). The data suggest that photobleaching occurs owing to the reactivity of hydroxyl radicals, though singlet oxygen is generated by TiOPcs much more efficiently. The phototoxicity of the tested TiOPcs toward bacteria has been revealed. It is proposed that both OH and (1)O(2) might be responsible for the observed bactericidal effects.",M1

The first step is to evaluate the bimolecular rate constants for the reaction of ()OH and e(aq)(-). Transient absorption spectra for the intermediates formed by the reaction of ()OH were also measured over the time period of 1-250micros to assist in selecting the appropriate wavelength for the absolute bimolecular reaction rate constants. For these four compounds, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, and doxycycline, the absolute rate constants with ()OH were (6.3+/-0.1)x10(9), (5.2+/-0.2)x10(9), (5.6+/-0.1)x10(9), and (7.6+/-0.1)x10(9) M(-1) s(-1), and for e(aq)(-) were (2.2+/-0.1)x10(10), (1.3+/-0.2)x10(10), (2.3+/-0.1)x10(10), and (2.5+/-0.1)x10(10) M(-1) s(-1), respectively. The efficiencies for ()OH reaction with the four tetracyclines ranged from 32% to 60%. The efficiencies for e(aq)(-) reaction were 15-29% except for chlortetracycline which was significantly higher (97%) than the other tetracyclines in spite of the similar reaction rate constants for e(aq)(-) in all cases. To evaluate the use of advanced oxidation/reduction processes for the destruction of tetracyclines it is necessary to have reaction rates, reaction efficiencies and destruction mechanisms. This paper is the first step in eventually realizing the formulation of a detailed kinetic destruction model for these four tetracycline antibiotics.",M1
20014077,"A new highly selective and sensitive assay for fluorescence imaging of *<e>OH</e> in living cells: effectively avoiding the interference of peroxynitrite.A new nonredox fluorescent probe to realize the imaging of hydroxyl radicals (*OH) in living cells was designed and synthesized. The structure comprised the fluorescent dye boron dipyrromethene (BDP) and a 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinoxyl (TEMPO) unit. This probe could rapidly respond to *OH with a detection limit of 18 pM, and it possessed superior photostability and pH insensitivity. Other reactive oxygen species (ROS) and relevant intracellular components did not interfere. In particular, the important problem of ONOO(-) interference was efficiently avoided. An MTT assay proved that the probe was not very cytotoxic. The probe could penetrate into intact cell membranes to selectively detect intracellular *OH without causing cellular damage in living mice macrophages, normal human liver cells. and human hepatoma cells. These advantageous characteristics make the fluorescent probe potentially useful as a new candidate to detect *OH in broad biosystems.",M1
20000714,"Kinetics and products of the <e>OH</e> radical-initiated reaction of 1,4-butanediol and rate constants for the reactions of OH radicals with 4-hydroxybutanal and 3-hydroxypropanal.Rate constants for the gas-phase reactions of the OH radical with 1,4-butanediol,4-hydroxybutanal, and 3-hydroxypropanalwere measured at 298 +/- 2 K and atmospheric pressure using a relative rate technique and with 4-hydroxybutanal and 3-hydroxypropanal being formed in situ from the OH + 1,4-butanediol reaction, and were (in units of 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)) 3.67 +/- 0.31, 3.0(-1.0)(+1.5), and 3.5(-1.0)(+1.3), respectively, with the latter being a lower limit because of the possibility of second-generation formation of 3-hydroxypropanal from OH + 4-hydroxybutanal. The measured formation yields of 4-hydroxybutanal and 3-hydroxypropanal from the OH + 1,4-butanediol reaction in the presence of NO were 58 +/- 19% and 55 +/- 12%, respectively. In addition to the formation of 4-hydroxybutanal and 3-hydroxypropanal, gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analyses of reacted OH + 1,4-butanediol reactionsshowedformation of glycolaldehyde [HOCH(2)CHO], malonaldehyde [HC(O)CH2CHO], and 1,4-butanedial [HC(O)CH(2)CH(2)CHO].

20000701,"Efficient alpha-(alkylthio)alkyl-type radical formation in (*)<e>OH</e>-induced oxidation of alpha-(methylthio)acetamide.Pulse radiolysis with UV-vis/ESR detection and steady-state gamma-radiolysis, combined with chromatographic techniques, were used to investigate the detailed mechanism of the (*)OH-induced oxidation of alpha-(methylthio)acetamide (alpha-MTA) in aqueous solution. The main pathway involves the formation of hydroxysulfuranyl radicals alpha-MTA-(&gt;S(*)-OH) and alpha-(alkylthio)alkyl radicals H(3)C-S-(*)CH-C( horizontal lineO)-NH(2) (lambda(max) &lt;/= 260 and 340 nm). The latter radicals are highly stabilized through the combined effect of both substituents in terms of the captodative effect. At low pH, alpha-MTA-(&gt;S(*)-OH) radicals undergo efficient conversion to intermolecularly three-electron-bonded dimeric radical cations of alpha-MTA-(&gt;S thereforeS&lt;)(+) (lambda(max) = 480 nm), especially for high alpha-MTA concentrations. In contrast, at low proton concentrations, alpha-MTA-(&gt;S(*)-OH) radicals decompose via the elimination of water, formed through intramolecular hydrogen (attached to the nitrogen atom) transfer to the hydroxysulfuranyl moiety within a six-membered structure. This process leads to the formation of the imine radical H(3)C-S-CH(2)-C( horizontal lineO)(*)NH, which subsequently decays in three independent channels. The first decay channel begins with a beta-scission followed by hydrolysis and a subsequent Hofmann rearrangement. One of the end products of this first decay channel is CO(2), which was detected. The second decay channel involves an intramolecular hydrogen transfer from the deltaC carbon atom to the radical imine site producing the alpha-(alkylthio)alkyl radical H(2)C(*)-S-CH(2)-C( horizontal lineO)-NH(2). In the third decay channel there is a 1,3-hydrogen shift in the imine radical which forms the radical H(3)C-S-(*)CH-C( horizontal lineO)-NH(2). The presence of the amide group induces more complex radical chemistry that leads unexpectedly to the degradation of the CH(3)SCH(2)CONH(2) molecule into gaseous products, CO(2) and NH(3). These features of the mechanism of the (*)OH-induced oxidation of alpha-MTA are quite different from those seen in other organic sulfides in neutral solutions.",M1
19962821,"Plasma chemical degradation of phosphorous-containing warfare agents simulants.The gliding electric discharge (or  glidarc ) technique is a new advanced oxidation process used for the degradation of organic solutes or spent solvents. Discharges in humid air at atmospheric pressure produce active species (i.e., .<e>OH</e> and .NO) that are able to oxidize organic target up to carbon oxides and water. Aqueous solutions of triethylphosphate (TEP), a warfare agent simulant, are exposed to a glidarc in humid air to evaluate the solute stability under the impinging flux of active species. TEP was degraded and the overall zero order kinetic rate (k(0)=3.4 x 10(-4)mol h(-1)) was compared with that of previously considered tributylphosphate. The total degradation of TEP is monitored by the formation of H(3)PO(4) as the ultimate oxidation product of phosphorus by total organic carbon measurements. Extra investigation was performed on dimethylmethylphosphonate to examine the potential influence of the molecule symmetry on the degradation rate.",M1
19959205,"Fenton-like degradation of MTBE: Effects of iron counter anion and radical scavengers.Fenton-driven oxidation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (0.11-0.16mM) in batch reactors containing ferric iron (5mM) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) (6mM) (pH=3) was performed to investigate MTBE transformation mechanisms. Independent variables included the forms of iron (Fe) (Fe(2)(SO(4))(3).9H(2)O and Fe(NO(3))(3).9H(2)O), H(2)O(2) (6, 60mM), chloroform (CF) (0.2-2.4mM), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (25, 50mM), and sulfate (7.5mM). MTBE, tert-butyl alcohol and acetone transformation were significantly greater when oxidation was carried out with Fe(NO(3))(3).9H(2)O than with Fe(2)(SO(4))(3).9H(2)O. Sulfate interfered in the formation of the ferro-peroxy intermediate species, inhibited H(2)O(2) reaction, hydroxyl radical (()<e>OH</e>) formation, and MTBE transformation. Transformation was faster and more complete at a higher [H(2)O(2)] (60mM), but resulted in lower oxidation efficiency which was attributed to ()OH scavenging by H(2)O(2). CF scavenging of the superoxide radical (()O(2)(-)) in the ferric nitrate system resulted in lower rates of ()O(2)(-) reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II), ()OH production, and consequently lower rates of MTBE transformation. IPA, an excellent scavenger of ()OH, completely inhibited MTBE transformation in the ferric nitrate system indicating oxidation was predominantly by ()OH. ()OH scavenging by HSO(4)(-), formation of the sulfate radical (()SO(4)(-)), and oxidation of MTBE by ()SO(4)(-) was estimated to be negligible. The form of Fe (i.e., counter anion) selected for use in Fenton treatment systems impacts oxidative mechanisms, treatment efficiency, and post-oxidation treatment of residuals which may require additional handling and cost.",M1
19943648,"Effective rate constants and uptake coefficients for the reactions of organic molecular markers (n-alkanes, hopanes, and steranes) in motor oil and diesel primary organic aerosols with hydroxyl radicals.Hydroxyl radical (<e>OH</e>) uptake by organic aerosols, followed by heterogeneous oxidation, happens nearly at the collision frequency. Oxidation complicates the use of organic molecular markers such as hopanes for source apportionment, since receptor models assume markers are stable during transport. We report the oxidation kinetics of organic molecular markers (C(25)-C(32) n-alkanes, hopanes and steranes) in motor oil and primary organic aerosol emitted from a diesel engine at atmospherically relevant conditions inside a smog chamber. A thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (TAG) and Aerodyne high resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) were used to measure the changes in molecular comosition and bulk primary organic aerosol. From the measured changes in molecular composition, we calculated effective OH rate constants, effective relative rate constants, and effective uptake coefficients for molecular markers. Oxidation rates varied with marker volatility, with more volatile markers being oxidized at rates much faster than could be explained from heterogeneous oxidation. This rapid oxidation can be explained by significant gas-phase OH oxidation that dominates heterogeneous oxidation, resulting in overall oxidation lifetimes of 1 day or less. Based on our results, neglecting oxidation of molecular markers used for source apportionment could introduce significant error, since many common markers such as norhopane appear to be semivolatile under atmospheric conditions.",M1
19943615,"Unimolecular beta-hydroxyperoxy radical decomposition with <e>OH</e> recycling in the photochemical oxidation of isoprene.A novel process in the photochemical oxidation of isoprene that recycles hydroxyl (OH) radicals has been identified using first-principles computational chemistry. Isoprene is the dominant biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC), and its oxidation controls chemistry in the forest boundary layer and is also thought to contribute to cloud formation in marine environments. The mechanism described here involves rapid unimolecular decomposition of the two major peroxy radicals (beta-hydroxyperoxy radicals) produced by OH-initiated isoprene oxidation. Peroxy radicals are well-known as key intermediates in VOC oxidation, but up to now were only thought to be destroyed in bimolecular reactions. The process described here leads to OH recycling with up to around 60% efficiency in environments with low levels of peroxy radicals and NO(x). In forested environments reaction of the beta-hydroxyperoxy radicals with HO2 is expected to dominate, with a small contribution from the mechanism described here. Peroxy radical decomposition will be more important in the unpolluted marine boundary layer, where lower levels of NO and HO2 are encountered.",M1

19931544,"Cellular and molecular mechanisms of 17beta-estradiol postconditioning protection against gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion in rats.AIMS: To investigate the protective effects of 17beta-estradiol postconditioning against ischemia/reperfusion (I-R)-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats. MAIN METHODS: The animal model of gastric ischemia/reperfusion was established by clamping of the celiac artery for 30 min and reperfusion for 30 min, 1h, 3h, 6h, 12h or 24h. 17beta-estradiol at doses of 5, 50 or 100 microg/kg (rat) was administered via peripheral veins 2 min before reperfusion. In a subgroup of rats, the estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant (Ful, 2mg/kg) was intravenously injected prior to 17beta-estradiol administration. Histological and immunohistochemical methods were employed to assess the gastric mucosal injury index and gastric mucosal cell apoptosis and proliferation. The malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity and hydroxyl free radical (-<e>OH</e>) inhibitory ability were determined by colorimetric assays. Subsequently, the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in rat gastric mucosa was examined by western blotting. KEY FINDINGS: 17beta-estradiol dose-dependently inhibited gastric I-R (GI-R) injury, and 17beta-estradiol (50 microg/kg) markedly attenuated GI-R injury 1h after reperfusion. 17beta-estradiol inhibited gastric mucosal cell apoptosis and promoted gastric mucosal cell proliferation in addition to increasing SOD activity and -OH inhibitory ability and decreasing the MDA content and XOD activity. The Bax protein level increased 1h after GI-R and was markedly reduced by intravenous administration of 17beta-estradiol. In contrast, the level of Bcl-2 protein decreased 1h after GI-R and was restored to normal levels by intravenous administration of 17beta-estradiol. These effects of 17beta-estradiol were inhibited by pretreatment with fulvestrant. SIGNIFICANCE: 17beta-estradiol postconditioning should be investigated further as a possible strategy against gastric mucosal injury.",M1

The removal of these six pharmaceuticals (meprobamate, carbamazepine, dilantin, atenolol, primidone and trimethoprim) varied between no observed removal and &gt;90%. The role of the water quality (i.e., alkalinity, nitrite, and specifically effluent organic matter (EfOM)) on hydroxyl radical (<e>OH</e>) exposure was evaluated and used to explain the differences in pharmaceutical removal between the three wastewaters. Results indicated that the efficacy of UV/H(2)O(2) treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater was a function of not only the concentration of EfOM but also its inherent reactivity towards OH. The removal of pharmaceuticals also correlated with reductions in ultraviolet absorbance at 254nm (UV(254)), which offers utilities a surrogate to assess pharmaceutical removal efficiency during UV/H(2)O(2) treatment.",M1

19924930,"Effects of precursor concentration and acidic sulfate in aqueous glyoxal-<e>OH</e> radical oxidation and implications for secondary organic aerosol.Previous experiments demonstrated that aqueous OH radical oxidation of glyoxal yields low-volatility compounds. When this chemistry takes place in clouds and fogs, followed by droplet evaporation (or if it occurs in aerosol water), the products are expected to remain partially in the particle phase, forming secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Acidic sulfate exists ubiquitously in atmospheric water and has been shown to enhance SOA formation through aerosol phase reactions. In this work, we investigate how starting concentrations of glyoxal (30-3000 microM) and the presence of acidic sulfate (0-840 microM) affect product formation in the aqueous reaction between glyoxal and OH radical. The oxalic acid yield decreased with increasing precursor concentrations, and the presence of sulfuric acid did not alter oxalic acid concentrations significantly. A dilute aqueous chemistry model successfully reproduced oxalic acid concentrations, when the experiment was performed at cloud-relevant concentrations (glyoxal &lt;300 microM), but predictions deviated from measurements at increasing concentrations. Results elucidate similarities and differences in aqueous glyoxal chemistry in clouds and in wet aerosols. They validate for the first time the accuracy of model predictions at cloud-relevant concentrations. These results suggest that cloud processing of glyoxal could be an important source of SOA.",M1
19910116,"Influence of bicarbonate and carbonate ions on sonochemical degradation of Rhodamine B in aqueous phase.The influence of bicarbonate and carbonate ions on sonolytic degradation of cationic dye, Rhodamine B (RhB), in water was investigated. As a consequence of ultrasonic cavitation that generates .<e>OH</e> radicals, carbonate radicals were secondary products of water sonochemistry when it contains dissolved bicarbonate or carbonate ions. The results clearly demonstrated the significant intensification of sonolytic destruction of RhB in the presence of bicarbonate and carbonate, especially at lower dye concentrations. Degradation intensification occurs because carbonate radicals sonochemically formed undergo radical-radical recombination at a lesser extent than hydroxyl radicals. The generated carbonate radicals are likely able to migrate far from the cavitation bubbles towards the solution bulk and are suitable for degradation of an organic dye such as RhB. Therefore, at low dye concentrations, carbonate radical presents a more selective reactivity towards RhB molecules than hydroxyl radical. In the presence of bicarbonate, degradation rate reached a maximum at 3 g L(-1) bicarbonate, but subsequent addition retards the destruction process. In RhB solutions containing carbonate, the oxidation rate gradually increased with increasing carbonate concentration up to 10 g L(-1) and slightly decreased afterward. Carbonate radicals sonochemically generated are suitable for total removal of COD of sonicated RhB solutions.",M1
19880340,"Physical facets of ultrasonic cavitational synthesis of zinc ferrite particles.This paper addresses the physical features of the ultrasonic cavitational synthesis of zinc ferrite particles and tries to establish the relationship between cavitation physics and sonochemistry of the zinc ferrite synthesis. A dual approach of coupling experimental results with simulations of radial motion of cavitation bubbles has been adopted. The precursors for the zinc ferrite, viz. ZnO and Fe(3)O(4) are produced in situ by the hydrolysis of Zn and Fe(II) acetates stimulated by (*)<e>OH</e> radicals produced from the transient collapse of the cavitation bubbles. Experiments performed under different conditions create significant variation in the production of (*)OH radicals, and hence, the rate of acetate hydrolysis. Correlation of the results of experiments and simulations sheds light on the important facets of the physical mechanism of ultrasonic cavitational zinc ferrite synthesis. It is revealed that too much or too little rate of acetate hydrolysis results in smaller particle size of zinc ferrite. The first effect of a higher rate of hydrolysis leads to excessively large growth of particles, due to which they become susceptible to the disruptive action of cavitation bubbles. Whereas, the second effect of too small rate of hydrolysis of Zn and Fe(II) acetates restricts the growth of particles. It has been observed that the initial reactant concentration does not influence the mean particle size or the size distribution of zinc ferrite particles. The present investigation clearly confirms that the rate-controlling step of zinc ferrite synthesis through ultrasonic cavitational route is the rate of formation of (*)OH radicals from cavitation bubbles.",M1

19834032,"Protection of the retina by rapid diffusion of hydrogen: administration of hydrogen-loaded eye drops in retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury.PURPOSE: Retinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury by transient elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) is known to induce neuronal damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species. Study results have indicated that molecular hydrogen (H(2)) is an efficient antioxidant gas that selectively reduces the hydroxyl radical (*<e>OH</e>) and suppresses oxidative stress-induced injury in several organs. This study was conducted to explore the neuroprotective effect of H(2)-loaded eye drops on retinal I/R injury. METHODS: Retinal ischemia was induced in rats by raising IOP for 60 minutes. H(2)-loaded eye drops were prepared by dissolving H(2) gas into a saline to saturated level and administered to the ocular surface continuously during the ischemia and/or reperfusion periods. One day after I/R injury, apoptotic cells in the retina were quantified, and oxidative stress was evaluated by markers such as 4-hydroxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine. Seven days after I/R injury, retinal damage was quantified by measuring the thickness of the retina. RESULTS: When H(2)-loaded eye drops were continuously administered, H(2) concentration in the vitreous body immediately increased and I/R-induced *OH level decreased. The drops reduced the number of retinal apoptotic and oxidative stress marker-positive cells and prevented retinal thinning with an accompanying activation of Müller glia, astrocytes, and microglia. The drops improved the recovery of retinal thickness by &gt;70%. CONCLUSIONS: H(2) has no known toxic effects on the human body. Thus, the results suggest that H(2)-loaded eye drops are a highly useful neuroprotective and antioxidative therapeutic treatment for acute retinal I/R injury.",M1

Theoretical quantum mechanics study.Reactions of reactive oxygen species and more specifically - of hydroxyl radical ((*)<e>OH</e>) - with nucleosides may lead to the generation of radicals in the base and 2-deoxyribose moieties. In the present study emphasis was put on the possible reaction modes of 2'-deoxyadenosine (dA) radicals, leading to the formation of related 5',8-cyclonucleosides. It appears that the prerequisite for the formation of 5',8-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosine (cdA) is the adoption of O4'-exo conformation by 2-deoxyribose; however, this is the least energetically favored conformer among the different puckered forms adopted by the furanose ring.

19806722,"Photo-Fenton reaction at near neutral pH.The photo-Fenton reaction, oxidation of photoproduced ferrous iron by hydrogen peroxide, produces reactive oxidants that may be important to degradation of biologically and chemically recalcitrant organic compounds in surface waters at circum-neutral pH. Sufficient Fe(II) for the photo-Fenton reaction was produced in situ at two field sites (pH 6.1-7.1) and during irradiations of model systems at pH 7.0 with Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA). Amorphous iron oxyhydroxide preparations were much more easily photoreduced than ferrihydrite (Ferr-90). The rate of the photo-Fenton reaction was measured as the difference in the H2O2 accumulation rate in irradiations without and with iron in model systems. Use of benzene as a probe for hydroxyl radical (<e>OH</e>) and nitrate photolysis as the OH source indicated that the yield of phenol from the reaction of benzene with OH is reduced in the presence of iron and SRFA. Even when this reduction in yield was accounted for, the rate of OH production from the Fenton reaction in the model systems was much smaller than the rate of the photo-Fenton reaction. These results indicate that OH is not the only oxidant produced by the photo-Fenton reaction in circum-neutral natural waters; however the photo-Fenton reaction could still be significant for contaminant degradation.",M1
19799602,"Oestradiol protects against the harmful effects of fluoride more by increasing thiol group levels than scavenging hydroxyl radicals.The aim of the study was to investigate the role of oestrogens in free radical detoxication upon exposure to fluoride. Interactions between xenobiotics and oestrogens need to be investigated, especially as many chemicals interact with the oestrogen receptor. It is still unknown whether free radical-generating xenobiotics can influence the antioxidative ability of oestradiol (E(2)). In an in vitro examination of human placental mitochondria, thiobarbituric active reagent species (TBARS), hydroxyl radical ((*)<e>OH</e>) generation and protein thiol (-SH) groups were detected. 17beta-E(2) was examined in physiological (0.15-0.73 nM) and experimental (1-10 microM) concentrations and sodium fluoride (NaF) in concentrations of 6-24 microM. E(2) in all the concentrations significantly decreased lipid peroxidation measured as the TBARS level, in contrast to NaF, which increased lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation induced by NaF was decreased by E(2). The influence of E(2) on (*)OH generation was not very significant and depended on the E(2 )concentration. The main mechanism of E(2) protection in NaF exposure appeared to be connected with the influence of E(2 )on thiol group levels, not (*)OH scavenging ability. The E(2) in concentrations 0.44-0.73 nM and 1-10 microM significantly increased the levels of -SH groups, in contrast to NaF, which significantly decreased them. E(2) at every concentration reversed the harmful effects of NaF on -SH group levels. No unfavourable interactions in the influence of E(2) and NaF on TBARS production, (*)OH generation, or -SH group levels were observed. The results suggest that postmenopausal women could be more sensitive to NaF-initiated oxidative stress.",M1
19785994,"Inhibition of peroxynitrite-mediated DNA strand cleavage and hydroxyl radical formation by aspirin at pharmacologically relevant concentrations: implications for cancer intervention.Epidemiological studies have suggested that the long-term use of aspirin is associated with a decreased incidence of human malignancies, especially colorectal cancer. Since accumulating evidence indicates that peroxynitrite is critically involved in multistage carcinogenesis, this study was undertaken to investigate the ability of aspirin to inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated DNA damage. Peroxynitrite and its generator 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) were used to cause DNA strand breaks in phiX-174 plasmid DNA. We demonstrated that the presence of aspirin at concentrations (0.25-2mM) compatible with amounts in plasma during chronic anti-inflammatory therapy resulted in a significant inhibition of DNA cleavage induced by both peroxynitrite and SIN-1. Moreover, the consumption of oxygen caused by 250 microM SIN-1 was found to be decreased in the presence of aspirin, indicating that aspirin might affect the auto-oxidation of SIN-1. Furthermore, EPR spectroscopy using 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap demonstrated the formation of DMPO-hydroxyl radical adduct (DMPO-<e>OH</e>) from authentic peroxynitrite, and that aspirin at 0.25-2mM potently diminished the radical adduct formation in a concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that aspirin at pharmacologically relevant concentrations can inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated DNA strand breakage and hydroxyl radical formation. These results may have implications for cancer intervention by aspirin.",M1
19779151,"Character and spatial distribution of <e>OH</e>/H2O on the surface of the Moon seen by M3 on Chandrayaan-1.The search for water on the surface of the anhydrous Moon had remained an unfulfilled quest for 40 years. However, the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) on Chandrayaan-1 has recently detected absorption features near 2.8 to 3.0 micrometers on the surface of the Moon. For silicate bodies, such features are typically attributed to hydroxyl- and/or water-bearing materials. On the Moon, the feature is seen as a widely distributed absorption that appears strongest at cooler high latitudes and at several fresh feldspathic craters. The general lack of correlation of this feature in sunlit M3 data with neutron spectrometer hydrogen abundance data suggests that the formation and retention of hydroxyl and water are ongoing surficial processes. Hydroxyl/water production processes may feed polar cold traps and make the lunar regolith a candidate source of volatiles for human exploration.",M1
19779149,"Temporal and spatial variability of lunar hydration as observed by the Deep Impact spacecraft.The Moon is generally anhydrous, yet the Deep Impact spacecraft found the entire surface to be hydrated during some portions of the day. Hydroxyl (<e>OH</e>) and water (H2O) absorptions in the near infrared were strongest near the North Pole and are consistent with &lt;0.5 weight percent H2O. Hydration varied with temperature, rather than cumulative solar radiation, but no inherent absorptivity differences with composition were observed. However, comparisons between data collected 1 week (a quarter lunar day) apart show a dynamic process with diurnal changes in hydration that were greater for mare basalts (approximately 70%) than for highlands (approximately 50%). This hydration loss and return to a steady state occurred entirely between local morning and evening, requiring a ready daytime source of water-group ions, which is consistent with a solar wind origin.",M1
19772319,"Spin trapping of radicals other than the *<e>OH</e> radical upon reduction of the anticancer agent tirapazamine by cytochrome P450 reductase.The radical species produced following one-electron reduction of tirapazamine (3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine 1,4-dioxide, TPZ) by cytochrome P(450) reductase-enriched microsomes have been investigated using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Spin trapping with 5,5'-dimethylpyrroline 1-N-oxide (DMPO) gave a composite spectrum of a carbon-centered radical and the well-known DMPO-OH adduct. Using (17)O-labeled water resulted in a change in the EPR spectrum to that of DMPO-(17)OH, indicating that this radical species is formed with solvent involvement and not from release of a (*)OH radical from one-electron-reduced TPZ. Furthermore, using the closely related spin trap 5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methylpyrroline N-oxide (DEPMPO), which is less prone to oxidation than DMPO, gave only a carbon-centered radical spectrum without any involvement of a (*)OH radical. Reduction of a more soluble analogue of TPZ, in redox equilibrium with its 1-oxide derivative, led to spin trapping of both a carbon-centered radical and a nitrogen-centered radical by N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN). The multicentered nature of this nitrogen-centered radical spectrum provides support for the formation of a benzotriazinyl radical following one-electron reduction of this class of bioreductive drug.",M1
19768848,"Mechanism of scavenging action of N-acetylcysteine for the <e>OH</e> radical: a quantum computational study.N-Acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione, is an effective antioxidant present in biological systems. The mechanism of scavenging action of N-acetylcysteine for the OH radical was studied theoretically. For this purpose, reactions of the OH radical at the different sites of N-acetylcysteine were investigated. All the relevant extrema on the potential energy surfaces were located by optimizing the geometries of the reactant and product complexes as well as those of the transition states at the BHandHLYP/AUG-cc-pVDZ level of density functional theory in the gas phase. The solvent effect of aqueous media was treated by performing single point energy calculations at the BHandHLYP/AUG-cc-pVDZ and MP2/AUG-cc-pVDZ levels of theory employing the polarizable continuum model. Correction for basis set superposition error (BSSE) was made by the counterpoise method. Rate constants for all the reaction mechanisms were calculated including the tunneling contributions. Our calculations show that the hydrogen atom of the SH group of N-acetylcysteine would be most efficiently abstracted by the OH group, which is in agreement with experimental observations.",M1
19768540,"Ethyl pyruvate inhibits peroxynitrite-induced DNA damage and hydroxyl radical generation: implications for neuroprotection.Ethyl pyruvate (EP) has recently been reported to afford protection against neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanism underlying EP-mediated neuroprotection remains to be elucidated. Because peroxynitrite has been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of various forms of neurodegenerative disorders via its cytotoxic effects, this study was undertaken to investigate whether the neuroprotective effect of EP is associated with inhibition of peroxynitrite-induced DNA strand breaks, a critical event leading to peroxynitrite elicited cytotoxicity. Incubation of phiX-174 plasmid DNA with 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), a peroxynitrite generator, led to the formation of both single- and double-stranded DNA breaks in a concentration- and time- dependent manner. The presence of EP (0.5-10 mM) was found to significantly inhibit SIN-1-induced DNA strand breaks in a concentration-dependent fashion. The consumption of oxygen induced by 250 microM SIN-1 was found to be decreased in the presence of EP (0.5-10 mM), indicating that EP might affect the auto-oxidation of SIN-1. It was observed that incubation of the plasmid DNA with authentic peroxynitrite caused significant DNA strand breaks, which could also be dramatically inhibited by EP (0.5-10 mM). EPR spectroscopy in combination with spin-trapping technique using 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N- oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap demonstrated the formation of DMPO-hydroxyl radical adducts (DMPO-<e>OH</e>) from authentic peroxynitrite, and that EP at 0.5-10 mM inhibited the adduct signal in a concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that EP can inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated DNA damage and hydroxyl radical generation.",M1
19764247,"Bimolecular rate constant determination for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with domoic and kainic acid in aqueous solution.Bimolecular rate constants for the hydroxyl radical, .<e>OH</e>, reaction with domoic acid, kainic acid, and several model compounds were determined using electron pulse radiolysis and transient absorption spectroscopy. These oxidation rate constants were determined as (9.22 +/- 0.60) x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) and (2.46 +/- 0.19) x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1), for domoic acid and kainic acid, respectively. Model compound rate constant measurements suggested that the conjugated double bond of the C4 substituent of domoic acid, and the double bond in kainic acid, were the preferential initial site of .OH reaction, which would destroy the conjugation and/or molecular conformation of these toxins. These reaction rate constants were also used to determine potential persistence in natural water systems, however the calculated half-life for domoic acid of approximately 34 days implies that significant photodegradation via .OH reaction mechanisms is unlikely.",M1
19759617,"New particle formation in forests inhibited by isoprene emissions.It has been suggested that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are involved in organic aerosol formation, which in turn affects radiative forcing and climate. The most abundant VOCs emitted by terrestrial vegetation are isoprene and its derivatives, such as monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. New particle formation in boreal regions is related to monoterpene emissions and causes an estimated negative radiative forcing of about -0.2 to -0.9 W m(-2). The annual variation in aerosol growth rates during particle nucleation events correlates with the seasonality of monoterpene emissions of the local vegetation, with a maximum during summer. The frequency of nucleation events peaks, however, in spring and autumn. Here we present evidence from simulation experiments conducted in a plant chamber that isoprene can significantly inhibit new particle formation. The process leading to the observed decrease in particle number concentration is linked to the high reactivity of isoprene with the hydroxyl radical (<e>OH</e>). The suppression is stronger with higher concentrations of isoprene, but with little dependence on the specific VOC mixture emitted by trees. A parameterization of the observed suppression factor as a function of isoprene concentration suggests that the number of new particles produced depends on the OH concentration and VOCs involved in the production of new particles undergo three to four steps of oxidation by OH. Our measurements simulate conditions that are typical for forested regions and may explain the observed seasonality in the frequency of aerosol nucleation events, with a lower number of nucleation events during summer compared to autumn and spring. Biogenic emissions of isoprene are controlled by temperature and light, and if the relative isoprene abundance of biogenic VOC emissions increases in response to climate change or land use change, the new particle formation potential may decrease, thus damping the aerosol negative radiative forcing effect.",M1
19746921,"Reaction rate coefficients of <e>OH</e> radicals and Cl atoms with ethyl propanoate, n-propyl propanoate, methyl 2-methylpropanoate, and ethyl n-butanoate.Kinetics of the reactions of OH radicals and Cl atoms with four saturated esters have been investigated. Rate coefficients for the gas-phase reactions of OH radicals with ethyl propanoate (k(1)), n-propyl propanoate (k(2)), methyl 2-methylpropanoate (k(3)), and ethyl n-butanoate (k(4)) were measured using a conventional relative rate method and the pulsed laser photolysis-laser induced fluorescence technique. At (296 +/- 2) K, the rate coefficients obtained by the two methods were in good agreement. Significant curvatures in the Arrhenius plots have been observed in the temperature range 243-372 K for k(1), k(3), and k(4). The rate coefficients for the reactions of the four esters with Cl atoms were determined using the relative rate method at (296 +/- 2) K and atmospheric pressure. The values obtained are presented, compared with the literature values when they exist, and discussed. Reactivity trends and atmospheric implications for these esters are also presented.",M1
19736597,"Simple phenolic composition, flavonoid contents and antioxidant capacities in water-methanol extracts of Tunisian common date cultivars (Phoenix dactylifera L.).The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the phenolic acid composition, flavonoid content and antioxidant activity of fruits from common date cultivars. The simple phenolic content ranged from 15.73 (Mermella variety) to 54.66 mg/100 g fresh weight (Korkobbi variety). Korkobbi had also the highest content of total flavonoids (54.46 quercetin equivalents/100 g fresh weight). The percentage of inhibition can reach 83% in the lipoperoxyl radical of the Korkobbi variety, while it was about 95% with the Rotbi variety for <e>OH</e>.. The Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity value provided a ranking in decreasing order at 6 min: Korkobbi &gt; Bouhattam &gt; Baht = Smiti &gt; Bekreri = Garn ghzal &gt; Mermilla = Kenta &gt; Nefzaoui = Rotbi. It seems that the highest level of flavonoids in the Korkobbi variety was principally responsible for the highest antiradical efficiency of this cultivar.",M1
19734681,"Effect of water-surface discharge on the inactivation of Bacillus subtilis due to protein lysis and DNA damage.The effect of water-surface discharge on the inactivation of Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633 in water was examined by using a very short high-voltage pulse generator. The surviving number of spore cells at 10(4) CFU/ml in initial concentration exponentially decreased with increasing discharge-treatment time. The input energy into the water-surface discharge under an O(2) gas flow for reduction in the survival number to 10% was lower than that under an air flow because many oxidation agents such as ozone and <e>OH</e> radical were produced under the O(2) gas flow. The input energy density for the one-tenth reduction depended not only on the spore state but also on the initial cell concentration. The input energy for the high-concentration spore cells (10(7) CFU/ml) was much higher than that for the low-concentration spore cells (10(4) CFU/ml). Cellular proteins and DNA were degraded by a 30-min discharge treatment of vegetative cells, whereas DNA of the high-concentration spore cells was relatively resistant.",M1
19731708,"Ozonation of wastewater: rate of ozone consumption and hydroxyl radical yield.For the prediction of the elimination efficiency of micropollutants from wastewater by ozone, the ozone rate constants of the micropollutants and the kinetics of the reaction of ozone with wastewater must be known. The latter is multiphasic with k = 0.071 (mg DOC)(-1) s(-1) for the first mg/L ozone (at a DOC of 7.2 mg/L) followed by 0.011 (mg DOC)(-1) s(-1) the next 5 mg/L ozone and the k = 0.0019 (mg DOC)(-1) s(-1) for subsequent 4 mg/L ozone as determined by stopped-flow and batch-quench methods. An analysis of gel permeation and UV absorption data indicates that the wastewater DOC is largely polymeric, and at 12 mg/L the concentration of its subunits must be near 100 microM with epsilon(254 nm) approximately 3000 M(-1) cm(-1). The *<e>OH</e> radical yield as determined by the tertiary butanol assay is approximately 13%. From its dose dependence, it follows that new *OH-generating sites are formed during ozonation. The *OH scavenging capacity of the wastewater DOC has been determined at 3 x 10(4) (mg DOC)(-1) s(-1). The contribution of bicarbonate to the OH scavenging capacity is small in comparison, approximately 10% of DOC. Simulations indicate that at 5 mg/L ozone only the most reactive (k &gt; 3 x 10(30 M(-1) s(-1)) micropollutants are fully eliminated but at 10 mg/L ozone the slow ozone decay starts to contribute and even the much less reactive ones (k = 300 M(-1) s(-1)) are oxidized (25% remaining).",M1
19731614,"Chemical composition, olfactory evaluation and antioxidant effects of essential oil from Mentha canadensis.The chemical composition of the essential oil from cornmint (Mentha canadensis L.) was analyzed by GC/FID and GC-MS. The main constituents were menthol (41.2%) and menthone (20.4%). It was established that cornmint oil had antiradical activity with respect to the DPPH and hydroxyl (<e>OH</e>*) radicals. The concentrations necessary for 50% neutralization of the respective radicals (IC50) were 365.0 microg/mL for DPPH and 0.3 microg/mL for OH*, which was indicative that the antioxidant activity in terms of OH* was higher than that of quercetin. Cornmint oil chelated the Fe3+ ions present in the solution. The oil demonstrated antioxidant activity in a linoleic acid emulsion model system, where at 0.1% concentration it inhibited the formation of conjugated dienes by 57.1% and the generation of secondary oxidized products of linoleic acid by 76.1%.",M1
19729596,"Endogenous activation of mitochondrial KATP channels protects human failing myocardium from hydroxyl radical-induced stunning.RATIONALE: During reperfusion of ischemic myocardium, a burst of hydroxyl radicals (<e>OH</e>) induces contractile dysfunction ( myocardial stunning ), and OH in the plasma of patients after myocardial infarction predict the development of heart failure. The effects of OH on myocardial function in patients with heart failure; however, have never been assessed. Furthermore, although ATP-dependent K+ channels (K(ATP) channels) are implicated in myocardial protection during ischemia/reperfusion ( ischemic preconditioning ), their role in heart failure has hardly been elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of OH on cardiac contractile function in human failing myocardium, and to clarify the role of K(ATP) channels during this response. METHODS AND RESULTS: In isolated left ventricular trabeculae of nonfailing hearts, OH (produced by Fe3+-nitrilotriacetic acid and H2O2) induced substantial systolic and diastolic dysfunction, whereas in failing myocardium, stunning was virtually absent. Although in failing myocardium, protein expression of sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels (Kir6.2/SUR2) was approximately 2-fold upregulated, their blockade with HMR-1098 did not impair contractile function in the presence of OH. In contrast, when blocking mitochondrial K(ATP) channels during OH exposure (with 5-HD), failing myocardium developed contractile dysfunction to a degree that was comparable to H-induced stunning in nonfailing myocardium without K(ATP) channel blockade. CONCLUSIONS: Human failing left ventricular myocardium is resistant to OH-induced stunning, and this resistance is related to endogenous activation of putative mitochondrial K(ATP) channels. Given that certain sulfonylurea drugs that also block mitochondrial K(ATP) channels (eg, glibenclamide) are frequently used for the treatment of diabetes, our results imply that in patients with heart failure and diabetes, these drugs may impair left ventricular function during ischemia/reperfusion.",M1
19728723,"Kinetics of the gas-phase reaction of <e>OH</e> with chlorobenzene.The kinetics of the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with chlorobenzene was studied experimentally using a pulsed laser photolysis/pulsed laser induced fluorescence technique over a wide range of temperatures, 298-670 K, and at pressures between 13.33 and 39.92 kPa. The bimolecular rate constants demonstrate different behavior at low and high temperatures. At room temperature, T = 298.8 +/- 1.5 K, the rate constant is equal to (6.02 +/- 0.34) x 10(-13) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1); at high temperatures (474-670 K), the rate constant values are significantly lower and have a positive temperature dependence that can be described by an Arrhenius expression k1(T) = (1.01 +/- 0.35) x 10(-11) exp[(-2490 +/- 170 K)/T] cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1). This behavior is consistent with the low-temperature reaction being dominated by reversible addition and the high-temperature reaction representing abstraction and addition-elimination channels. The potential energy surface of the reaction was studied using quantum chemical methods, and a transition state theory model was developed for all reaction channels. The temperature dependences of the high-temperature rate constants obtained in calculations using the method of isodesmic reactions for transition states (IRTS) and the CBS-QB3 method are in very good agreement with experiment, with deviations smaller than the estimated experimental uncertainties. The G3//B3LYP-based calculated rate constants are in disagreement with the experimental values. The IRTS-based model was used to provide modified Arrhenius expressions for the temperature dependences of the rate constant for the abstraction and addition-elimination (Cl replacement) channels of the reaction.",M1
19692169,"Kinetics and mechanism of 2,6-dimethyl-aniline degradation by hydroxyl radicals.This research investigated the intrinsic second-order rate constant between 2,6-dimethyl-aniline (2,6-DMA) and hydroxyl radicals (<e>OH</e>) using Fenton's reactions under both batch and continuous operations. The competitive kinetics technique with aniline as a reference compound was employed. In the batch study under various conditions, the second-order rate constants of 2,6-DMA with OH were between 1.59 x 10(10) and 1.80 x 10(10)M(-1)s(-1) with a mean of 1.71 x 10(10)M(-1)s(-1) which equals the average value obtained from the continuous study as well. The concentrations of OH at the steady state under the continuous mode were estimated to be between 4.85 x 10(-10) and 6.82 x 10(-10)mM. 2,6-dimethyl-nitrobenzene, 2,6-dimethyl-phenol, 2,6-dimethyl-nitrophenol, 2,6-dimethyl-hydroquinone, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, and 2,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-p-benzoquinone were identified as the aromatic by-products indicating that the methyl group on the aromatic ring was not susceptible to OH attack. Maleic, lactic, oxalic, acetic, and formic acids were found as generated carboxylic acids. An oxidation pathway of 2,6-DMA by OH is also proposed.",M1
19689151,"Infrared spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations of <e>OH</e>-(H2O)n complexes.Infrared spectra of OH-(H2O)n (n = 1, 2) isolated in solid Ne were measured by FT-IR spectroscopy.

Observation of the recombination reaction OH-H2O + H --&gt; (H2O)2 under dark conditions provides undisputed evidence for our spectroscopic assignment.

19674839,"Sonochemical destruction of nonylphenol: effects of pH and hydroxyl radical scavengers.Nonylphenols are water-stable endocrine disrupting compounds that inhibit the growth of sewage bacteria in biological processes. The study describes the decomposition of 4-n-nonylphenol (NP) in water by 20 kHz ultrasound with emphasis on the impacts of pH, concentration and <e>OH</e> scavengers. It was found that the rate of degradation was accelerated by alkalinization, but more so by the addition of hydroxide alkalinity than carbonate. The addition of low doses of CO(3)(2-) and t-butyl alcohol as strong scavengers of OH was also found to accelerate the decomposition of NP. The observation was attributed to the generation of reactive CO(3)(2-) and CH(3) via pyrolysis of the additives in the cavity bubbles. The results also revealed that NP did not compete with OH scavenging agents when their relative concentration was low. In case of high frequency sonication (861 kHz) the competition was slightly effective (slowed down degradation) at an identical dose of t-butyl alcohol. The difference was attributed to shorter bubble life time at high frequencies leading to less violent/less energetic bubble collapse and lower yield of CH(3).",M1
19673312,"Synergetic effect of ultrasound with dual fields for the degradation of nitrobenzene in aqueous solution.Experiments have been performed with a semicontinuous batch reactor to compare the degradation efficiency of nitrobenzene in aqueous solution by the ultrasonic processes of single field, opposite dual fields, and orthogonal dual fields. Ultrasound with dual fields can improve the degradation efficiency of nitrobenzene compared to that of single field, and the improvement phenomenon is even more pronounced in the orthogonal dual-field system. The degradation reactions of nitrobenzene in the three processes all follow the pseudofirst-order kinetic model. The mechanism investigation indicates the degradation proceeds via hydroxyl radical (*<e>OH</e>) oxidation. The enhancement efficiency of orthogonal dual fields is attributed to an obvious synergetic effect, which accelerates the *OH initiation from 0.28 micromol L(-1) min(-1) for a single field to 0.98 micromol L(-1) min(-1) compared with 0.42 micromol L(-1) min(-1) for opposite dual fields, resulting in rapid formation of an increased diversity of byproducts and an advanced degree of mineralization of total organic carbon (TOC). The introduction of an ultrasonic field placed in the different spatial position causes a variable kinetic order during the removal of TOC. The degradation byproducts are identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry and ion chromatography, including p-, m-nitrophenol, malonic acid, nitrate ion, 4-nitrocatechol, phenol, maleic acid, oxalic acid, hydroquinone, 1,2,3-trihydroxy-5-nitrobenzene, and acetic acid.",M1
19670893,"Kinetics of the hydride reduction of an NAD(+) analogue by isopropyl alcohol in aqueous and acetonitrile solutions: solvent effects, deuterium isotope effects, and mechanism.The rate constants of the hydride-transfer reactions from isopropyl alcohol (i-PrOH) to an NAD(+) model, 9-phenylxanthylium ion (PhXn(+)), in acetonitrile (AN) and in water containing AN (80% H(2)O/20% AN) were determined over a temperature range from 36 to 67 degrees C. The reactions follow second-order rate laws. In the latter solution, formation of the water adduct of PhXn(+) was observed as a side-equilibrium (K). The observed inverse solvent kinetic isotope effect (k(H(2)O)(obs)/k(D(2)O)(obs) = 0.54), the larger than unity equilibrium isotope effect (K(H(2)O)/K(D(2)O) = 2.69), and the results of acid effect on the observed rate constants of the reactions are consistent with the  side-equilibrium mechanism . Kinetic isotope effects at all three H/D positions of i-PrOH for the net hydride-transfer process were determined in both solutions at 60 degrees C: KIE(alpha-D)(H) = 3.2(AN), 3.2(H(2)O); KIE(beta-D6)(H) = 1.05(AN), 1.16(H(2)O); KIE(OD)(H) = 1.08(AN), 1.04(H(2)O). These KIE values are consistent with the presence of the positively charged alcohol moiety in the transition state (TS) for cleavage of the alpha-C-H bond, the delocalization of the positive charge over the alpha-C-<e>OH</e> group, and the stepwise hydride and proton transfer processes. Comparison of the activation parameters for the reactions in the two solvent systems as well as those in the i-PrOH/AN (1:1 v/v) reported earlier suggests that the AN medium promotes the reaction by activating the ground-state alcohol reactant through weak interactions with the electron pairs on alcohol O, while water and parent alcohol media facilitate the reaction by H-bonding stabilization of the alcohol moiety of the TS. Results suggest that in the alcohol dehydrogenases without a Zn(II) cofactor in the active sites alcohols would be oxidized via hydride transfer to NAD(+) coenzyme followed by the rapid deprotonation to the nearby basic species in the active site of the enzymes.",M1
19665455,"Antioxidant activity and free radical scavenging reactions of hydroxybenzyl alcohols. Biochemical and pulse radiolysis studies.Comparative studies on free radical scavenging by isomers of hydroxybenzyl alcohols (HBAs) were carried out to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the antioxidant action. Using rat liver mitochondria as model systems, we have examined the radioprotective and antioxidant effects of hydroxybenzyl alcohols. Apart from their ability to scavenge free radicals and ferric reducing power, HBAs have shown good protection against radiation and oxidative stress. Using peroxyl radicals as initiator of reactive oxygen species (ROS), studies were carried out to evaluate antioxidant properties of HBAs against rat liver mitochondrial membrane components such as lipid and protein. Our results show that HBAs are potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation thus suggesting their role as free radical scavengers. In the presence of HBAs, restoration of depleted activity of Mn-SOD has also been investigated. In the presence of 2-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (2-HBA) complete restoration in the activity of Mn-SOD was observed on exposure to 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH). Free radical scavenging ability of HBAs were found to be comparable to alpha tocopherol. Pulse radiolysis technique has been used to study the reactions of HBAs with various biologically relevant reactive species such as hydroxyl radical (<e>OH</e>) and trichloromethyl peroxyl radical (CCl3O2). HBAs could scavenge OH radical giving initially OH-adducts which in turn decays to phenoxyl radicals. Reactions of phenoxyl radicals of HBAs with ascorbic acid have been also studied. Redox potential of HBAs has been evaluated with cyclic voltammetry. Studies clearly suggest a structural reactivity correlation between radical scavenging and antioxidant properties of these isomers of HBA. Among the 3 isomers of HBAs, 4-HBA and 2-HBA are found to have better radical scavenging and antioxidant properties than 3-HBA.",M1
19655764,"Birch reductive alkylation of biaryls: scope and limitations.Birch reductive alkylation of biaryls has been carried out by varying the nature of the substituents on the aromatic rings. Our investigations have focused on electron-rich substituents such as OMe, <e>OH</e>, and NR(2) groups as they are present on the skeleton of targeted alkaloids. The regioselectivity is strongly affected by the electronic nature of these substituents on both rings. The 3,5-dimethoxyphenyl moiety is selectively reduced and then alkylated, while phenols and anilines do not react under these conditions. A biaryl possessing both a 3,5-dimethoxyphenyl moiety and a phenol ring may, however, be reduced and alkylated provided the acidic phenolic proton is removed prior to the treatment with Li in NH(3). Similarly, biaryls possessing a o-sulfonamide group are reduced regioselectively and alkylated with alpha-chloroacetonitrile or N-tosylaziridine to provide the corresponding dienes in reasonable to good yields. A survey of the alkylating agents was also performed showing that various functional groups may be introduced at the benzylic position, including esters, primary and tertiary amides, nitriles, epoxides, and acetals and also unfunctionalized sterically hindered t-Bu groups and cyclopropyl substituents. The introduction of the latter indicates that both a S(N)2 and a SET mechanism may take place during the alkylating step.",M1
19651187,"Ferritin-dependent radical generation in rat liver homogenates.The hypothesis of this study was that mammalian ferritin (FER) has the ability of releasing Fe in the tissue to catalyze the generation of free radicals, such as ascorbyl (A) and hydroxyl radical (<e>OH</e>), that might lead to the damage of FER itself. The rat liver homogenates exhibited an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal with the spectral features (a(H)=1.88 G, g=2.0054) of A. The addition to the reaction medium of isolated rat liver FER increased by 3-fold the EPR signal, as compared to the recorded value in its absence. Isolated microsomes from rat liver incubated during 10 min showed a signal with the spectral features (a(H)=15G, g=2.0062) of OH. The addition of FER in the presence of either ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) or adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) significantly increased the recorded spectra. The labile Fe pool (LIP) in the homogenate was assessed by EPR. The rat liver homogenates exhibited an EPR signal with the spectral features (g=4.3) of the Fe(2+) and was significantly increased by the addition of FER (3-fold). The oxidation profile of the isolated FER from rat liver was analyzed after incubation with 10 mM ascorbate (AH(-)). A drastic increase in the width of the band suggested alterations to the protein structure. The FER content of tryptophan (Trp) and thiols was significantly lower when the incubation was performed in the presence of AH(-) as compared to the recorded effect in its absence. The data in tissue homogenates presented here showed that radical generation is associated to FER Fe release, and moreover that the FER protein itself was affected during this process.",M1
19647776,"Neuroprotective effect of the antiparkinsonian drug pramipexole against nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in rotenone-treated mice.Pramipexole, an agonist for dopamine (DA) D2/D3-receptors, has been used to treat both early and advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we examined the effect of pramipexole on DA neurons in a PD model of C57BL/6 mice, which were treated with rotenone (30 mg/kg, p.o.) daily for 28 days. Pramipexole (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected daily 30 min before each oral administration of rotenone. Chronic oral administration of rotenone caused a loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), motor deficits and the up-regulation of alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in some surviving DA neurons. Pramipexole inhibited rotenone-induced DA neuronal death and motor deficits, and reduced immunoreactivity for alpha-synuclein. In addition, pramipexole inhibited the in vitro oligomerization of human wild-type alpha-synuclein by H(2)O(2)plus cytochrome c. To examine the neuroprotective effect of pramipexole against oxidative stress, we used a DJ-1-knockdown SH-SY5Y cell line and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry. Simultaneous treatment with H(2)O(2) and pramipexole resulted in the significant protection of DJ-1-knockdown cells against cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. A high concentration of pramipexole directly scavenged hydroxyl radical (*<e>OH</e>) generated from H(2)O(2) and Fe(2+). Furthermore, pramipexole increased Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in DA neurons in the SNpc. These results suggest that pramipexole may protect DA neurons against exposure to rotenone by chronic oral administration, and this effect is mediated by multiple functions including scavenging of *OH and induction of Bcl-2 protein.",M1

CASTEP, a first-principles density functional theory (DFT) code, was employed to investigate Ca adsorption on various rutile (110) surfaces in order to clarify how hydroxyl groups effect Ca adsorption. The surfaces modeled in the present study include a bare rutile (110) surface, a hydroxylated rutile (110) surface, an oxidized rutile (110) surface, and a rutile (110) surface bonded with mixed <e>OH</e> groups and water. The results reveal that not all OH groups favors to attract Ca adsorption and loosely bonded OH and water on a rutile surface actually combine with Ca during adsorption. An oxidized rutile surface has the highest ability to attract Ca atoms, which partially explains that alkali-treated Ti surfaces could induce hydroxyapatite formation in alkaline environments.",M1
19632292,"Involvement of extracellular ascorbate and iron in hydroxyl radical generation in rat striatum in carbon monoxide poisoning.Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning stimulated generation in rat striatum of toxic hydroxyl radicals (*<e>OH</e>), which might participate in the CO-induced neuronal injury. Since an increase in extracellular ascorbate (AA) stimulated *OH generation in the presence of endogenous metals, including iron, in rat striatum in vivo, we examined the role of extracellular AA in *OH generation due to CO poisoning in the present study. The CO-induced *OH generation in the striatum was strongly suppressed by intrastriatal administration of active, but not inactivated, AA oxidase, which degrades extracellular AA. In addition, CO poisoning caused a significant increase in extracellular AA in rat striatum, suggesting a role of extracellular AA in the CO-induced *OH generation. However, the time-course of changes in extracellular AA could not be completely superimposed on that of the CO-induced *OH generation. On the other hand, the CO-induced *OH generation was completely suppressed by an iron chelator, deferoxamine. These findings suggest that *OH generation in rat striatum due to CO poisoning may involve both extracellular AA and chelatable iron.",M1
19632146,"Synthesis, fluorescence study and biological evaluation of three Zn(II) complexes with Paeonol Schiff base.The synthesis of three Paeonol Schiff base ligand and their Zn(II) complexes are reported. The complexes were fully characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, elemental analysis and molar conductivity. The experiment results show the three Zn(II) complexes can emit bright fluorescence at room temperature in DMF solution and solid state. The fluorescence quantum yields (Phi) of three Schiff base ligands and their Zn(II) complexes were calculated using quinine sulfate as the reference with a known Phi(R) of 0.546 in 1.0N sulfuric acid. Furthermore, in order to develop these Zn(II) complexes' biological value, the antioxidant activities against hydroxyl radicals (<e>OH</e>*) were evaluated. The results show the three complexes possess excellent ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals.",M1
19616936,"Induction of hydroxyl radical production in Trametes versicolor to degrade recalcitrant chlorinated hydrocarbons.Extracellular hydroxyl radical ((*)<e>OH</e>) production via quinone redox cycling in Trametes versicolor, grown in a chemically defined medium, was investigated to degrade trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), 1,2,4- and 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (TCB). The activity of the enzymes catalyzing the quinone redox cycle, quinone reductase and laccase, as well as the rate of (*)OH production, estimated as the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) from 2-deoxyribose, increased rapidly during the first 2-3 days and then remained at relatively constant levels. Under quinone redox cycling conditions, TCE degradation was concomitant to TBARS production and chloride release, reaching a plateau after 6 h of incubation. Similar results were obtained in PCE, 1,2,4- and 1,3,5-TCB time course degradation experiments. The mole balance of chloride release and 1,2,4-TCB and TCE degraded suggests that these chemicals were almost completely dechlorinated. Experiments using [(13)C]-TCE confirmed unequivocal transformation of TCE to (13)CO(2). These results are of particular interest because PCE and 1,3,5-TCB degradation in aerobic conditions has been rarely reported to date in bacterial or fungal systems.",M1
19616818,"Semicontinuous Fenton oxidation of phenol in aqueous solution. A kinetic study.This work investigates the Fenton oxidation of phenol in a semicontinuous reactor where the overall amount of H(2)O(2) is distributed as a continuous feed upon the reaction time. The experiments were carried out at 25 degrees C and atmospheric pressure, with 100mg/L initial phenol concentration and iron dosages from 1 to 100 mg/L. H(2)O(2) aqueous solution was continuously fed during 4h reaction time up to an overall dose varying within the range of 500-5000 mg/L. The results in terms of evolution of phenol, H(2)O(2) and intermediates, as well as TOC abatement were compared with those obtained in conventional batch operation. It was found that the oxidation rates for phenol and intermediates were lower when adding the H(2)O(2) continuously. However, a higher abatement of TOC was reached at the end of the 4-h reaction time, in spite of a similar overall H(2)O(2) consumption. This is the result of a more efficient <e>OH</e> generation throughout the semicontinuous process, favouring the reaction with the organic species and reducing the occurrence of competitive scavenging reactions involving Fe(2+), H(2)O(2) and OH. Two kinetic models were proposed, one for describing the evolution of phenol, aromatics and H(2)O(2) and the other for TOC. The influence of the operating conditions on the kinetic constants was also studied, looking for the optimal conditions in terms of both, environmental and economic points of view.",M1
19608422,"Reactions of hydroxyl radical with bergenin, a natural poly phenol studied by pulse radiolysis.Reactions of pulse radiolytically generated hydroxyl (()<e>OH</e>) radicals and one-electron specific oxidants, Br(2)(-) radicals with bergenin, a polyphenolic tannin derivative, were studied and the transients detected by absorption spectrometry. The transient absorption spectrum produced during the reaction of ()OH radicals with bergenin was broad, and pH dependent. Different modes of reactions of ()OH radicals with bergenin, viz., addition to the aromatic ring adduct and hydrogen abstraction was established by time resolved (5-400micros) transient absorption studies and also by the reaction of Br(2)(-) radicals. Comparing the transient spectra with ()OH radicals and Br(2)(-) radicals at pH 4.5 and 8.5, the absorption maximum of the phenoxyl radical was found to be at 440nm at pH 4.5 and 480nm at pH 8.5. Phenoxyl radicals are produced during ()OH radical reaction through the formation of ()OH radical adduct followed by water/OH(-) elimination. While the phenoxyl radicals of bergenin are oxidizing in nature, the hydroxyl radical adducts and the radicals produced from hydrogen abstraction are of reducing nature. The yield of the oxidizing radicals produced from the ()OH radical reaction with bergenin was determined to be 26.2% by secondary electron transfer reaction from TMPD. On the other hand the yield of reducing radicals produced from the ()OH radical reaction with bergenin was determined to be 74.1% by secondary electron transfer reaction to MV(2+). ()OH radical reactions with bergenin under oxygenated conditions and reaction with trichloro methyl peroxyl radicals with bergenin produced a new transient absorbing at 400nm, which is attributed to peroxyl type of radicals. The one-electron reduction potential for the formation of phenoxyl radical from bergenin was determined to be 0.938V versus NHE at pH 7, by electron transfer equilibrium between bergenin and chlorpromazine. The above results confirmed that reaction of ()OH radicals with bergenin, mainly produced radical adducts and one-electron oxidation accounts to only a minor process. The radical adducts may be converted to peroxyl radicals in presence of oxygen. Based on these results it can be concluded that although bergenin is a polyphenol, it may not act as a potent antioxidant, but may be act as pro-oxidant.",M1
19604632,"Degradation pathways of crystal violet by Fenton and Fenton-like systems: condition optimization and intermediate separation and identification.The main advantage of Fenton's reagent (FR) over other <e>OH</e> systems is its simplicity. FR has the potential for widespread use in treating wastewater, but compared to other OH systems, little information on the dye degradation pathways of FR exists. The degradation of crystal violet (CV), a triphenylmethane dye, by FR was determined as a function of reagent concentration and ratio and pH in the batch treatment. The experimental results showed the optimum Fe(2+)/H(2)O(2) ratio to be 0.5mM:50mM and the optimum Fe(3+)/H(2)O(2) ratio to be 1mM:50mM. Optimal pH was about 3. To obtain a better understanding of the mechanistic details of Fenton reagent's degradation of CV dye, the intermediates of the process were separated, identified, and characterized by HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS and GC-MS techniques in this study. Indications were that the probable degradation pathways were N-de-methylation and cleavage of the conjugated chromophore structure. The intermediates were generated in the order of the reaction time and relative concentration, indicating that the N-de-methylation degradation of CV dye is a major reaction pathway. The reaction mechanisms proposed in this research should prove useful for future application of the technology to the decolorization of dyes.",M1
19603646,"Comparative photoactivity and antibacterial properties of C60 fullerenes and titanium dioxide nanoparticles.The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by aqueous suspensions of fullerenes and nano-TiO2 (Degussa P25) was measured both in ultrapure water and in minimal Davis (MD) microbial growth medium. Fullerol (hydroxylated C60) produced singlet oxygen (1O2) in ultrapure water and both 1O2 and superoxide (O2-*) in MD medium, but no hydroxyl radicals (<e>OH</e>*) were detected in either case. PVP/C60 (C60 encapsulated with poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)) was more efficient than fullerol in generating singlet oxygen and superoxide. However, two other aggregates of C60, namely THF/nC60 (prepared with tetrahydofuran as transitional solvent) and aqu/nC60 (prepared by vigorous stirring of C60 powder in water), were not photoactive. Nano-TiO2 (also present as aggregates) primarily produced hydroxyl radicals in pure water and superoxide in MD medium. Bacterial (Escherichia coli) toxicity tests suggest that, unlike nano-TiO2 which was exclusively phototoxic, the antibacterial activity of fullerene suspensions was linked to ROS production. Nano-TiO2 may be more efficient for water treatment involving UV or solar energy, to enhance contaminant oxidation and perhaps for disinfection. However, fullerol and PVP/ C60 may be useful as water treatment agents targeting specific pollutants or microorganisms that are more sensitive to either superoxide or singlet oxygen.",M1
19588917,"Photodissociation of 3-bromo-1,1,1-trifluoro-2-propanol at 193 nm: laser-induced fluorescence detection of <e>OH</e>(nu'' = 0, J'').Photodissociation of 3-bromo-1,1,1-trifluoro-2-propanol (BTFP) has been investigated at 193 nm, employing the laser photolysis laser-induced fluorescence technique. The nascent OH product was detected state selectively, and the energy released into translation, rotation, and vibration of the photoproducts has been measured. OH is produced mostly vibrationally cold, with a moderate rotational excitation, which is characterized by a rotational temperature of 640 +/- 140 K. However, an appreciable amount of the available energy of 36.1 kcal mol(-1) is released into translation of OH (15.1 kcal mol(-1)). OH product has no preference for a specific spin-orbit state, Pi(3/2) or Pi(1/2). However, between two Lambda-doublet states, Pi(+) and Pi(-), the OH product has a preference for the former by a factor of 2. A mechanism of OH formation from BTFP on excitation at 193 nm is proposed, which involves first the direct C-Br bond dissociation from a repulsive state (n(Br)sigma*(C-Br)) as a primary process. The primary product, F(3)C-CH(OH)-CH(2), with sufficient internal energy undergoes spontaneous C-OH bond dissociation, through a loose transition state. The formation rate of OH is calculated to be 5.8 x 10(6) s(-1) using Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus unimolecular rate theory. Experimental results have been supported by theoretical calculations, and energies of various low-energy dissociation channels of the primary product, F(3)C-CH(OH)-CH(2), have been calculated.",M1
19585966,"Rotational contour analysis of jet-cooled methyl hydroperoxide action spectra in the region of the 2nu(<e>OH</e>) and 3nu(OH) bands.State-selected photodissociation is used to record the partially rotationally resolved action spectra of CH(3)OOH in the region of its first and second OH-stretching overtones (2nu(OH) and 3nu(OH)) under free-jet expansion conditions. From an analysis of the rotational band contours for the OH-stretching states and their corresponding COOH torsion combination bands, effective rotational constants and transition dipole moment orientations are determined for the vibrational eigenstates. The level splitting between the lowest symmetric and antisymmetric pair of COOH torsion levels, 0(+) and 0(-), associated with the 2nu(OH) overtone state is found to be approximately 3.9 cm(-1). Comparison of spectra in the region of the 2nu(OH) and 2nu(OH) + nu(COOH) bands in CH(3)OOH and CD(3)OOH reveals that the spectral features in CH(3)OOH are substantially more perturbed compared to those of its deuterated counterpart, suggesting that modes involving the methyl rotor contribute significantly to promoting intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) in CH(3)OOH. Furthermore, a comparison of the average rotational line widths in both CH(3)OOH and CD(3)OOH for the 2nu(OH) and 2nu(OH) + nu(COOH) bands appears to suggest that at these energies, adding one quanta of low-frequency COOH torsional motion does not enhance the IVR rate relative to that of the pure OH-stretching overtone.",M1
19569345,"Novel relationship between hydroxyl radical initiation and surface group of ceramic honeycomb supported metals for the catalytic ozonation of nitrobenzene in aqueous solution.Comparative experiments have been performed to investigate the degradation efficiency of nitrobenzene and the removal efficiency of TOC in aqueous solution bythe processes of ceramic honeycomb supported different metals (Fe, Ni, and Zn) catalytic ozonation, indicating that the modification with metals can enhance the activity of ceramic honeycomb for the catalytic ozonation of nitrobenzene, and the loading percentage of metal and the metallicity respectively presents a positive influence on the degradation of nitrobenzene. The degradation efficiency of nitrobenzene is determined by the initiation of hydroxyl radical (*<e>OH</e>) according to a good linear correlation in all the processes of modified ceramic honeycomb catalytic ozonation at the different loading percentages of metals. The modification of ceramic honeycomb with metals results in the conversion of the pH at the point of zero charge (pHpzc) and the evolution of surface groups. Divergence from the conventional phenomenon, the enhancement mechanism of ozone decomposition on the modified ceramic honeycomb with metals is proposed due to the basic attractive forces of electrostatic forces or/and hydrogen bonding. Consequently, a novel relationship between the initiation of *OH and the surface-OH2+ group on the modified catalyst is established based on the synergetic effect between homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction systems.",M1
19558175,"Evidence of high *<e>OH</e> radical quenching efficiency by vitamin B6.Molecules acting as antioxidants capable of scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) are of the utmost importance in the living cell. The antioxidative properties of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) have recently been discovered. Previous theoretical calculations have shown a high reactivity of pyridoxine toward hydroxyl radicals, where the latter preferably abstract H from either carbon of the two methanol substituents (C8 or C9). In this study, we have explored the reactivity of pyridoxine toward further hydroxyl radicals, considering as the first step the H abstraction from either C8 or C9, also including addition reactions and cyclization. Many of the reactions display similar DeltaG, and hence, the quenching of hydroxyl radicals by pyridoxine may undergo different pathways leading to a mix of products. In addition, we observe that pyridoxine, under high hydroxyl radical concentrations, may scavenge up to eight radicals, supporting its observed high antioxidant activity.",M1
20359685,"A descriptive study on vitamin D levels in individuals with spinal cord injury in an acute inpatient rehabilitation setting.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of inadequate or severely deficient levels of vitamin D in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation service and to describe any associations between patient demographics and injury characteristics and vitamin D levels. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Academic inpatient SCI rehabilitation program. SUBJECTS: One hundred patients with SCI who were consecutively admitted to acute inpatient rehabilitation from January to December 2007. METHODS: Data were retrospectively abstracted from the patient's medical chart. OUTCOME MEASURE: VitD-25(<e>OH</e>). RESULTS: The prevalence of VitD-25(OH) inadequacy or severe deficiency was 93% in this sample of patients with SCI. The mean VitD-25(OH) level was 16.29 +/- 7.73 ng/mL, with a range from 7.00 to 36.80 ng/mL. Twenty-one percent of the sample had VitD-25(OH) levels that were considered as severely deficient (&lt; or =10 ng/mL). African-American subjects had statistically significant lower mean VitD-25(OH) levels compared with Caucasian subjects (12.96 versus 17.79 ng/mL; P = .003). Persons with an incomplete injury had significant lower mean VitD-25(OH) levels compared with complete injuries (14.64 versus 18.15 ng/mL; P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate or severely deficient levels of VitD-25(OH) were highly prevalent in patients with SCI admitted to an acute inpatient rehabilitation service. Evaluation of serum VitD-25(OH) levels are recommended in patients with SCI because low levels may contribute to osteoporosis.",M2

Of the 1,612 Staphylococcus aureus isolates evaluated for their antibiotic resistances, 947 were methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA). In 2007, MRSA infections reached 589 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, a 77% increase compared with 2006. The increase in MRSA infections was noticeable among youth (6-25 years old), middle-aged people (45-50 years old), and elderly people (86-90 years old). MRSA infections increased among inpatients by 58%, among outpatients by 43%, and among nursing home residents by 183%. More than 66% of MRSA infections were found among healthy people in the community with no apparent risk factors. More than 88.7% of the infections belong to only 9 profiles of antibiotic resistance indiscriminately distributed among inpatients, outpatients, and nursing home residents. This report sheds further light on the rapid spread of MRSA across Northeastern Ohio, stressing the need for better education in preventive measures and infection control at the level of community and health care settings.",M2
19673302,"The relationship between averaged sulfate exposures and concentrations: results from exposure assessment panel studies in four U.S. cities.This analysis examines differences between measured ambient indoor, and personal sulfate concentrations across cities, seasons, and individuals to elucidate how these differences may impact PM2.5 exposure measurement error. Data were analyzed from four panel studies conducted in Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, and Steubenville (<e>OH</e>). Among the study locations, 1912 person-days of personal sulfate data were collected over 396 days involving 245 individual sampling sessions. Long-term differences in ambient and personal levels averaged over time are examined. Differences between averaged ambient and personal sulfate among and within cities were observed, driven by between subject and city differences in sulfate infiltration, F(inf), from outdoors to indoors. Neglecting this source of variability in associations may introduce bias in studies examining long-term exposures and chronic health. Indoor sulfate was highly correlated with and similar in magnitude to personal sulfate, suggesting indoor PM monitoring may be another means of characterizing true exposure variability.",M2
19589767,"Assessing the impact of lifestyle modification education on knowledge and behavior changes in gastroesophageal reflux disease patients on proton pump inhibitors.OBJECTIVES: To assess patients' knowledge of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) lifestyle modifications and to identify patients' behaviors associated with GERD management before and after an educational intervention. METHODS: The study was conducted at five indigent health centers in Columbus, <e>OH</e>, from January to May 2007. A total of 30 adult patients with GERD receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy were assessed. In both the control and intervention groups, a pretest consisting of 23 questions assessed patients' knowledge regarding GERD and lifestyle modifications. A presurvey consisting of eight questions assessed patients' current behaviors associated with GERD management using both lifestyle modifications and PPIs. The intervention group also received approximately 10 minutes of education on lifestyle modifications. A posttest and postsurvey were given 8 to 12 weeks after the initial session to both groups. Main outcome measures included change in test score for patients in the control versus intervention groups. Outcomes measured on the pre- and postsurvey included source of heartburn information/education, smoking status, trigger foods eaten weekly, frequency of monthly heartburn episodes, and PPI adherence. RESULTS: The average change in test scores was 1.33 and 2.73 in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = 0.11; two-sample t test). The frequency of monthly heartburn episodes increased postsurvey in the control group; however, the frequency of monthly episodes decreased in the intervention group. For the presurvey, no patients reported ever having received GERD education from a pharmacist. For the postsurvey, all 15 patients in the intervention group stated that they had received education from a pharmacist. CONCLUSION: The intervention group patients had higher mean change in test scores compared with the control group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. The failure to achieve statistical significance may have resulted from the small sample size. The pharmacist-patient interaction improved patient knowledge and some behaviors made in GERD management and symptom reduction.",M2
19500050,"Human milk adiponectin is associated with infant growth in two independent cohorts.BACKGROUND: Adiponectin, a circulating adipocyte protein, is associated with lower obesity. We have previously shown that adiponectin is present in human milk. This study determined whether higher milk adiponectin is associated with infant growth and investigated milk adiponectin's oligomeric form. DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a study of two parallel longitudinal cohorts of breastfed infants born between 1998 and 2005. Forty-five mother-infant pairs from Cincinnati, <e>OH</e> and 277 mother-infant pairs from Mexico City, Mexico were analyzed. All participants were healthy, term infants breastfed at least 1 month who completed 6 months of follow-up. Monthly milk samples (n = 1,379) up to 6 months were assayed for adiponectin by radioimmunoassay. Infant weight-for-age, length-for-age, and weight-for-length Z-scores up to 6 months of age were calculated using World Health Organization standards. Repeated-measures analysis was conducted. The structural form of human milk adiponectin was assessed by western blot. RESULTS: In the population studies, initial milk adiponectin was 24.0 +/- 8.6 microg/L and did not differ by cohort. Over the first 6 months, higher milk adiponectin was associated with lower infant weight-for-age Z-score (-0.20 +/- 0.04, p &lt; 0.0001) and weight-for-length Z-score (-0.29 +/- 0.08, p = 0.0002) but not length-for-age Z-score, adjusted for covariates, with no difference by cohort. By western blot, human milk adiponectin was predominantly in the biologically active high-molecular-weight form. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest milk adiponectin may play a role in the early growth and development of breastfed infants.",M2
19320270,"Source apportionment of airborne particulate matter for the Speciation Trends Network site in Cleveland, <e>OH</e>.Aerosol composition data from the Speciation Trends Network (STN) site (East 14th Street) in Cleveland, OH, were analyzed by advanced receptor model methods for source apportionment as well as by the standard positive matrix factorization (PMF) using PMF2. These different models are used in combination to test model limitations. These data were 24-hr average mass concentrations and compositions obtained for samples taken every third day from 2001 to 2003. The Multilinear Engine (ME) was used to solve an expanded model to estimate the source profiles and source contributions and also to investigate the wind speed, wind direction, time-of-day, weekend/weekday, and seasonal effects. PMF2 was applied to the same dataset. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) and conditional probability function (CPF) analyses were used to locate the regional and local sources using the resolved source contributions and appropriate meteorological data. Very little difference was observed between the results of the expanded model and the PMF2 values for the profiles and source contribution time series. The identified sources were as ferrous smelter, secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate, soil/combustion mixture, steel mill, traffic, wood smoke, and coal burning. The CPF analysis was useful in helping to identify local sources, whereas the PSCF results were only useful for regional source areas. Both of these analyses were more useful than the wind directional factor derived from the expanded factor analysis. However, the expanded analysis provided direct information on seasonality and day-of-week behavior of the sources.",M2

19217441,"Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance*body mass index interactions at ages 9 to 10 years predict metabolic syndrome risk factor aggregate score at ages 18 to 19 years: a 10-year prospective study of black and white girls.If homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) interactions with obesity (body mass index [BMI]) at ages 9 to 10 years predict aggregate metabolic syndrome risk factors at ages 18 to 19 years, this would identify novel avenues for primary prevention of metabolic syndrome. Our hypothesis was that HOMA-IR*BMI interactions at ages 9 to 10 years would predict aggregate metabolic syndrome risk factor z scores at ages 18 to 19 years in prospective studies of a biracial population of girls. Two centers in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study measured serum insulin and glucose at ages 9 to 10 years and 5 metabolic syndrome risk factors at ages 18 to 19 years (triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and glucose). Studies in Cincinnati, <e>OH</e>, included girls from public and parochial schools in the inner city, within-city residential neighborhoods, and suburban areas; and those in Washington, DC, included girls from a health maintenance organization. Girls (194 white, 281 black) were studied first at ages 9 to 10 years, then at ages 18 to 19 years. We assessed HOMA-IR*BMI interactions at ages 9 to 10 years with race-specific z scores for 5 metabolic syndrome risk factors at ages 18 to 19 years. The lowest summed z score (mean +/- SD) was observed for subjects in the lowest tertiles for both HOMA-IR and BMI (-1.15 +/- 2.05), and the highest z score (2.58 +/- 3.11) was for subjects in the highest tertiles for both HOMA-IR and BMI (P &lt; .0001). For the top BMI tertile, there was a progressive increase in z score (increasing risk of metabolic syndrome) as HOMA-IR increased. Interaction of BMI with HOMA-IR at ages 9 to 10 years predicts aggregate metabolic risk score at ages 18 to 19 years, with progressive risk increments within the top BMI tertile as HOMA-IR increases, opening avenues for intervention to reduce both BMI and HOMA-IR at ages 9 to 10 years as a primary approach to prevention of metabolic syndrome at ages 18 to 19 years.",M2
19203846,"Characterization of an influenza A virus isolated from pigs during an outbreak of respiratory disease in swine and people during a county fair in the United States.In August 2007, pigs and people became clinically affected by an influenza-like illness during attendance at an Ohio county fair. Influenza A virus was identified from pigs and people, and the virus isolates were characterized as swine H1N1 similar to swine viruses currently circulating in the U.S. pig population. The swine isolate, A/SW/<e>OH</e>/511445/2007 (OH07), was evaluated in an experimental challenge and transmission study reported here. Our results indicate that the OH07 virus was pathogenic in pigs, was transmissible among pigs, and failed to cross-react with many swine H1 anti-sera. Naturally exposed pigs shed virus as early as 3 days and as long as 7 days after contact with experimentally infected pigs. This suggests there was opportunity for exposure of people handling the pigs at the fair. The molecular analysis of the OH07 isolates demonstrated that the eight gene segments were similar to those of currently circulating triple reassortant swine influenza viruses. However, numerous nucleotide changes leading to amino acid changes were demonstrated in the HA gene and throughout the genome as compared to contemporary swine viruses in the same genetic cluster. It remains unknown if any of the amino acid changes were related to the ability of this virus to infect people. The characteristics of the OH07 virus in our pig experimental model as well as the documented human transmission warrant close monitoring of the spread of this virus in pig and human populations.",M2
19063915,"Utilization and physical activity levels at renovated and unrenovated school playgrounds.OBJECTIVE: This study examined utilization and physical activity levels at renovated compared to unrenovated school playgrounds. METHODS: Ten unrenovated and ten renovated school playgrounds (renovated at least a year prior) in Cleveland, <e>OH</e> were matched on school and neighborhood characteristics. Using direct observation (SOPLAY), the number of persons attending each playground and their physical activity levels were recorded using separate counts for girls, boys, men and women. Each school was observed ten times for 90 min each time outside of school hours in 2005. Paired t-tests, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests, and regression analyses were completed to examine differences across school pairs. RESULTS: More persons overall including adults and children utilized the renovated playgrounds compared to the unrenovated playgrounds. The proportion moderately-to-vigorously active was not different between renovated and unrenovated playgrounds although the proportion of children, in particular boys, who were vigorously active was greater at the renovated playgrounds. Although utilization was higher at the renovated playgrounds, absolute utilization was low across all playgrounds. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that playgrounds renovations may have the potential to increase the number of children utilizing the playground outside of school hours and may increase the proportion of children, especially boys, who are vigorously active.",M2
18959493,"Emergence of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 19A, 6C, and 22F and serogroup 15 in Cleveland, Ohio, in relation to introduction of the protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine.BACKGROUND: A 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in 2000. METHODS: We determined serotypes and assessed antimicrobial susceptibility of 1235 invasive and noninvasive isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae recovered from children and adults at University Hospitals Case Medical Center (Cleveland, <e>OH</e>) during the period 1999-2007. RESULTS: The annual number of cases of S. pneumoniae infection decreased from 218 in 2000 to 86-130 during the period 2002-2007, with the number of cases involving invasive strains decreasing from 96 to 18-35. For 1999 versus 2005-2007, the annual incidence of vaccine serotypes decreased by 92% (95% confidence interval [CI], -96.3% to -87.0%), whereas that of vaccine-related and nonvaccine serotypes increased 207.4% (95% CI, 135.0%-297.7%) and 18.4% (95% CI, -10.0% to 52.3%), respectively. Serotypes 19A, 6C, and 22F and serogroup 15 accounted for most of these increases. For the period 2005-2007, antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that ceftriaxone was the most active parenteral beta-lactam for both meningeal and nonmeningeal infections (72% and 88% of isolates, respectively, were susceptible to this agent); only 52% were susceptible to penicillin G at the meningeal breakpoint, whereas 77% were susceptible at the new nonmeningeal breakpoint of 2 microg/mL. Amoxicillin was the most active oral beta-lactam (72% of isolates were susceptible), whereas 53% of isolates were susceptible to azithromycin, 69% to clindamycin, 63% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 100% to levofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents decreases in the incidence of infections involving vaccine serotypes, increases in infections involving other serotypes, and decreases in the activity of macrolides and clindamycin after conjugate vaccine introduction.",M2
18805051,"Evidence of human bocavirus circulating in children and adults, Cleveland, Ohio.BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently recognized parvovirus isolated from human respiratory secretions. OBJECTIVES: To define the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics in adult and pediatric patients with evidence of HBoV. STUDY DESIGN: From October 2005 through October 2006, we screened respiratory samples from children and adults negative for common respiratory pathogens for HBoV by PCR. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from medical records of HBoV positive individuals. RESULTS: Of 2075 samples screened, 1826 (88.0%) represented distinct respiratory events: 1539 (84.3%) were pediatric (&lt;18 years), and 273 (15.0%) adult (&gt; or =18 years). Forty (2.2%) patients had HBoV: 36 (2.3%) children and 4 (1.5%) adults. HBoV positive children had history of prematurity (31.3%) and cardiac disease (18.8%). Adults had underlying pulmonary (100%) and cardiac (50%) disease. Twenty-seven children (84.4%) were hospitalized; 9 (28.1%) required intensive care. All adults were hospitalized; none required intensive care. Nosocomial acquisition likely occurred in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV circulates in Cleveland, <e>OH</e>, in children and adults with similar frequencies, and can warrant hospitalization and intensive care. Further study would clarify our understanding of this newly recognized human pathogen.",M2

18300542,"Race differences in adherence to headache treatment appointments in persons with headache disorders.PURPOSE: This research characterized patterns and predictors of adherence to headache treatment appointments in patients presenting at headache specialty treatment clinics throughout Ohio. BASIC PROCEDURES: Participants were 186 patients (118 white, 68 African Americans, 89% female) in headache treatment clinics in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo, <e>OH</e>. The study used a naturalistic longitudinal cohort design and assessed patients during four treatment visits (pretreatment, one-month follow-up, two-month follow-up and six-month follow-up). During the 30 days prior to initiating new headache treatments, patients used a daily diary to record data on headache severity, frequency and disability; headache treatment locus of control and headache management self-efficacy; social support; and demographic characteristics. The Primary Care Evaluation for Mental Disorders interview was administered to all patients at pretreatment to screen for psychiatric diagnoses. Patient attendance at the four treatment appointments was used to create a dichotomous measure of treatment appointment adherence (i.e., 0 = completed treatment; 1 = terminated treatment prematurely). MAIN FINDINGS: African Americans were more likely to be diagnosed with depression than whites and were more likely to prematurely terminate their headache treatment appointments regardless of their socioeconomic status (SES). White patients with SES values above the median reported the lowest rate of premature treatment termination. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: Higher SES enables whites (but not African Americans) to attend all headache treatment appointments. Interventions that enable African-American headache patients to complete their prescribed headache treatments are urgently needed.",M2
18171641,"Health survey of residents living near farm fields permitted to receive biosolids.The authors studied the health status of residents living in Wood County, <e>OH</e>, near farm fields that were permitted to receive biosolids. They mailed a health survey to 607 households and received completed surveys from 437 people exposed to biosolids (living on or within 1 mile of the fields where application was permitted) and from 176 people not exposed to biosolids (living more than 1 mile from the fields where application was permitted). The authors allowed for up to 6 surveys per household. Results revealed that some reported health-related symptoms were statistically significantly elevated among the exposed residents, including excessive secretion of tears, abdominal bloating, jaundice, skin ulcer, dehydration, weight loss, and general weakness. The frequency of reported occurrence of bronchitis, upper respiratory infection, and giardiasis were also statistically significantly elevated. The findings suggest an increased risk for certain respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other diseases among residents living near farm fields on which the use of biosolids was permitted. However, further studies are needed to address the limitations cited in this study.",M2
18167507,"Adult and children's exposure to 2,4-D from multiple sources and pathways.In this study, we investigated the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) herbicide exposures of 135 preschool-aged children and their adult caregivers at 135 homes in North Carolina (NC) and Ohio (<e>OH</e>). Participants were randomly recruited from six NC and six OH counties. Monitoring was performed over a 48-h period at the participants' homes. Environmental samples included soil, outdoor air, indoor air, and carpet dust. Personal samples collected by the adult caregivers concerning themselves and their children consisted of solid food, liquid food, hand wipe, and spot urine samples. All samples were analyzed for 2,4-D (free acid form) by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 2,4-D was detected in all types of environmental samples but most often in carpet dust samples, with detection frequencies of 83% and 98% in NC and OH, respectively. The median level of 2,4-D in the carpet dust samples was about three times higher in OH homes compared to NC homes (156 vs. 47.5 ng/g, P&lt;0.0002). For personal samples, 2,4-D was more frequently detected in the hand wipe samples from OH participants (&gt;48%) than from NC participants (&lt;9%). Hand wipe levels at the 95th percentile were about five times higher for OH children (0.1 ng/cm(2)) and adults (0.03 ng/cm(2)) than for the NC children (0.02 ng/cm(2)) and adults (&lt;0.005 ng/cm(2)). 2,4-D was detected in more than 85% of the child and adult urine samples in both states. The median urinary 2,4-D concentration was more than twice as high for OH children compared to NC children (1.2 vs. 0.5 ng/ml, P&lt;0.0001); however, the median concentration was identical at 0.7 ng/ml for both NC and OH adults. The intraclass correlation coefficient of reliability for an individual's urinary 2,4-D measurements, estimated from the unadjusted (0.31-0.62) and specific gravity-adjusted (0.37-0.73) values, were somewhat low for each group in this study. The variability in urinary 2,4-D measurements over the 48-h period for both children and adults in NC and OH suggests that several spot samples were needed to adequately assess these participants' exposures to 2,4-D in residential settings. Results from this study showed that children and their adult caregivers in NC and OH were likely exposed to 2,4-D through several pathways at their homes. In addition, our findings suggest that the OH children might have been exposed to higher levels of 2,4-D through the dermal and nondietary routes of exposure than the NC children and the NC and OH adults.",M2
17765157,"Economic evaluation of carotid artery stenting versus carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis.BACKGROUND: The clinical effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is well established. But the economic impact of CEA and carotid artery stenting (CAS) is still uncertain. The objective of this study was to compare hospital costs and reimbursement for CAS and CEA. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective database analysis on pair-matched patients who underwent CEA (n = 31) and CAS (n = 31) at the Richard M Ross Heart Hospital in Columbus, <e>OH</e>. The hospital's clinical and financial databases were used to obtain patient-specific information and procedural charges. Cost data were generated by applying the hospital's ratio of cost to charges for all DRG charges. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to examine the differences between costs of these procedures. RESULTS: Data are reported as mean +/- SD. The mean age of patients in CAS group was 70.14 years (+/- 1.60 years) versus 68.64 years (+/- 1.75 years) for CEA patients (p &lt; 0.05). The total direct cost associated with CEA ($3,765.12+/-$2,170.82) was significantly lower than the CAS cost ($8,219.71+/-$2,958.55, p &lt; 0.001). The mean procedural cost for CAS ($7,543.61+/-$2,886.54) was significantly higher than that for CEA ($2,720.00+/-$926.38, p &lt; 0.001). The hospital experienced cost savings of $9,690.87 for CEA versus $4,804.79 for CAS from private insurance. Similarly, savings obtained by Medicare-enrolled CEA patients were higher than those for CAS patients ($1,497.79). CONCLUSIONS: CAS is significantly more expensive than CEA, with a major portion of cost attributed to the total procedural cost. The hospital experienced significant savings from CEA procedures compared with CAS under all DRG classifications and insurers. Hospitals must develop new financial strategies and improve the efficiency of infrastructure to make CAS financially viable.",M2

17505203,"Genetic testing in autism: how much is enough?PURPOSE: To evaluate the yield of genetic testing in children with autism spectrum disorders. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 71 unrelated patients with a diagnosis of an isolated autism spectrum disorder seen in a genetics clinic over a period of 14 months. For most, referrals occurred after evaluation by a developmental pediatrician and/or psychologist to establish the diagnosis. Tiered laboratory testing for the majority of the patients followed a guideline that was developed in collaboration with clinicians at The Autism Center at Children's Hospital, Columbus, <e>OH</e>. RESULTS: The patients included 57 males and 14 females; 57 met DSM-IV criteria for autism, with the rest being Asperger or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Macrocephaly [head circumference (HC) &gt;or=95%] was present in 19 (27%). Two children had visible chromosome abnormalities (47,XYY; 48,XY + 2mar/49,XY + 3mar). Two patients with autism and macrocephaly had heterozygous mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. Three females had Rett syndrome, each confirmed by DNA sequencing of the MECP2 gene. Extensive metabolic testing produced no positive results, nor did fragile X DNA testing. CONCLUSION: The overall diagnostic yield was 10% (7/71). PTEN gene sequencing should be considered in any child with macrocephaly and autism or developmental delay. Metabolic screening may not be warranted in autism spectrum disorders without more specific indications or additional findings.",M2
17458459,"Analysis of trace elements and ions in ambient fine particulate matter at three elementary schools in Ohio.The results from a chemical characterization study of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) measured at three elementary schools in Central and Southeast Ohio is presented here. PM2.5 aerosol samples were collected from outdoor monitors and indoor samplers at each monitoring location during the period of February 1, 1999, through August 31, 2000. The locations included a rural elementary school in Athens, <e>OH</e>, and two urban schools within Columbus, OH. The trace metal and ionic concentrations in the collected samples were analyzed using an X-ray fluorescence spectrophotometer and ion chromatography unit, respectively. Sulfate ion was found to be the largest component present in the samples at all three of the sites. Other abundant components included nitrate, chloride, ammonium, and sodium ions, as well as calcium, silicon, and iron. The average PM2.5 concentrations showed similar temporal variations among the three sites within the study region. PM2.5 and its major component, sulfate ion, showed strong seasonal variations with maximum concentrations observed during the summer at all three of the sites. The indoor environment was found to be more contaminated during the spring months (March through May) at New Albany (a suburb of Columbus, OH) and East Athens (rural Ohio area). Potential source contribution function analysis showed that particulate matter levels at the monitoring sites were affected by transport from adjoining urban areas and industrial complexes located along the Ohio River Valley. A preliminary outdoor source apportionment using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique was performed. The results from the PCA suggest that the study region was primarily impacted by industrial, fossil fuel combustion, and geological sources. The 2002 emissions inventory data for PM2.5 compiled by Ohio Environmental Protection Agency also showed impacts of similar source types, and this was used to validate the PCA analysis.",M2

17258193,"An observational study of 127 preschool children at their homes and daycare centers in Ohio: environmental pathways to cis- and trans-permethrin exposure.The potential exposures of 127 preschool children to the pyrethroid insecticides, cis- and trans-permethrin, in their everyday environments were examined. Participants were recruited randomly from 127 homes and 16 daycare centers in six Ohio (<e>OH</e>) counties. Monitoring was performed over a 48-h period at the children's homes and/or daycare centers. Samples collected included soil, carpet dust, indoor air, outdoor air, diet, hand wipes, surface wipes, transferable residues, and urine. The environmental samples were analyzed for the cis and trans isomers of permethrin, and the urine samples were analyzed for the pyrethroid urinary metabolite, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The isomers were detected most often in the dust (100%) and hand wipe (&gt;78%) samples collected at both homes and daycare centers. The median levels of cis-permethrin (470 and 1010 ng/g) were higher than the median levels of trans-permethrin (344 and 544 ng/g) in the dust samples at both the children's homes and daycare centers, respectively. In the children's hand wipe samples, the median levels of cis- and trans-permethrin were similar, ranging from 0.03 to 0.04 ng/cm(2), at both locations. The urinary metabolite 3-PBA was detected in 67% of the children's urine samples. The median urinary 3-PBA concentration for the children was 0.3 ng/mL, and the maximum value for one child was 33.8 ng/mL. The primary route of the children's exposure to the combined isomers was through dietary ingestion, followed by indirect ingestion. In addition, our calculated aggregate absorbed doses of permethrin accounted for about 60% of the excreted amounts of 3-PBA found in the children's urine. In conclusion, these children were potentially exposed to low levels of permethrin from several sources, and through several pathways and routes.",M2
17195494,"The Steubenville Comprehensive Air Monitoring Program (SCAMP): concentrations and solubilities of PM(2.5) trace elements and their implications for source apportionment and health research.The elemental compositions of the water-soluble and acid-digestible fractions of 24-hr integrated fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) samples collected in Steubenville, <e>OH</e>, from 2000 to 2002 were determined using dynamic reaction cell inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The water-soluble elemental compositions of PM(2.5) samples collected at four satellite monitoring sites in the surrounding region were also determined. Fe was the most abundant but least water soluble of the elements determined at the Steubenville site, having a mean ambient concentration of 272 ng/m3 and a median fractional solubility of 6%. Fe solubility and its correlations with SO4(2-) and temperature varied significantly by season, consistent with the hypothesis that secondary sulfates may help to mobilize soluble Fe under suitable summertime photochemical conditions. Significantly higher ambient concentrations were observed at Steubenville than at each of the four satellite sites for 10 of the 18 elements (Al, As, Ca, Cd, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb, and Zn) determined in the water-soluble PM(2.5) fraction. Concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Zn at Steubenville were substantially higher than concentrations reported recently for larger U.S. cities. Receptor modeling identified seven sources affecting the Steubenville site. An (NH4)2SO4-dominated source, likely representing secondary PM(2.5) from coal-fired plants to the west and southwest of Steubenville, accounted for 42% of the PM(2.5) mass, and two sources likely dominated by emissions from motor vehicles and from iron and steel facilities in the immediate Steubenville vicinity accounted for 20% and 10%, respectively. Other sources included an NH4NO3 source (15%), a crustal source (6%), a mixed nonferrous metals and industrial source (3%), and a primary coal combustion source (3%). Results suggest the importance of very different regional and local source mechanisms in contributing to PM(2.5) mass at Steubenville and reinforce the need for further research to elucidate whether metals such as Fe, Mn, and Zn play a role in the PM(2.5) health effects observed previously there.",M2

17189630,"Some statistical issues related to multiple linear regression modeling of beach bacteria concentrations.As a fast and effective technique, the multiple linear regression (MLR) method has been widely used in modeling and prediction of beach bacteria concentrations. Among previous works on this subject, however, several issues were insufficiently or inconsistently addressed. Those issues include the value and use of interaction terms, the serial correlation, the criteria for model selection, and model assessment. The present work shows that serial correlations, as often present in sequentially observed data records, deserve full attention from the modeler. The testing and adjustment for the time-series effect should be implemented in a statistically rigorous framework. The R(2) and Cp-statistic as joint criteria are recommended for the model selection process, while using the t-statistics associated with the full model is erroneous. During model selection, using interaction terms can often help to decrease the bias in reduced models, although the resulting improvement in the numerical performance may be limited. For the assessment of the model predictive capacity, which is different from testing the goodness of fit, a comprehensive set of statistics are advocated to allow for an objective evaluation of different models. Results obtained from the data at Huntington Beach, <e>OH</e>, show that erroneous conclusions could be drawn if only the model R(2) and the count of type I and type II errors are considered. In this sense, several previous works deserve further investigation.",M2
17178304,"The Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry: initial results from four prototypes.BACKGROUND: This paper summarizes the experiences of the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry first four prototype registries in Georgia (GA), Massachusetts (MA), Michigan (MI), and Ohio (<e>OH</e>), and includes information on their sampling design, case ascertainment, and data collection methods, as well as some key findings. METHODS: Using a combination of different sampling methods, each prototype obtained a representative statewide sample of hospitals. Acute stroke admissions were identified through prospective (MA, MI) or retrospective (GA, OH) methods. A common set of case definitions and data elements were used by each registry. Weighted site-specific frequencies and 95% confidence intervals were generated for each outcome. A summary estimate, representing a weighted average of the four site-specific estimates, was also calculated. RESULTS: Of the total 6867 admissions, 1487 (21.6%) were from the GA registry, 1206 (17.6%) from MA, 2566 (37.4%) from MI, and 1608 (23.4%) from the OH prototype. Just less than 60% of admissions were ischemic strokes (site-specific estimates ranged from 52% to 70%), with transient ischemic attack (18.5%) and intracerebral hemorrhage (8.8%) making up most of the remainder. Twenty-one percent of patients admitted were younger than 60 years of age, and 55.3% were women. The proportion of black subjects varied from 7.1% (MI) to 30.6% (GA). Twenty-three percent of admissions arrived at the emergency department within 3 hours of onset. Overall 4.5% of ischemic stroke admissions were treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; site-specific treatment rates were 3.0% (GA), 3.2% (OH), 3.4% (MI), and 8.5% (MA). Only a small minority of treated patients (range, 10.8% [OH] to 19.6% [MI]) received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator within the recommended 1 hour door-to-needle time. A minority of eligible subjects were screened for dysphagia (45.4%), underwent lipid testing (33.6%), or received smoking-cessation counseling (21.4%). In contrast, compliance with antithrombotic treatments at discharge was high (91.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A minority of acute stroke patients are treated according to established guidelines. Quality improvement interventions, targeted primarily at the healthcare systems level, are needed to improve acute stroke care in the United States.",M2

17086008,"Osler, cardiac disease, and students of medicine--Columbus, <e>OH</e>: December 1899. Our Distinguished Visitor  was the headline describing the day William Osler honored the Ohio Medical University (OMU) with a visit and clinical lecture. OMU, founded in 1892 and located in downtown Columbus, was the fourth in a series of 5 19th-century Columbus medical schools that were predecessors to The Ohio State University College of Medicine established in 1914. OMU occupied a new 5-story building adjacent to the Protestant Hospital established in 1891. Osler was the guest of Dr Edwin Frazer Wilson, Professor of Therapeutics and Clinical Medicine at OMU, a student of Osler's at the University of Pennsylvania, and an 1885 graduate of that institution. Osler was in Columbus for consultation with one of Dr Wilson's patients. While Osler was in Columbus, a teaching clinic and lecture was arranged at OMU. Murray B. McGonigle, OMU Class of 1900, reported the visit in The Phagocyte, the OMU student publication, and in the Columbus Medical Journal. There was an assemblage of hundreds of students in the amphitheater at clinic hour when OMU Chancellor, Dr David N. Kinsman, introduced Osler. The patient, a 16-year-old young man, was brought to the amphitheater with a history of kidney trouble. Osler's clinical evaluation, physical examination, diagnosis, and discussion of prognosis and treatment provided an object lesson that was impressed on the minds of the students. Following the clinic, Osler addressed the students in his familiar style, demonstrating his easy rapport with students. His comments to the students are classic statements combining personal encouragement with professional attitudes. McGonigle concluded,  these remarks by so eminent an authority are certainly encouraging for the future of the medical student if he will but heed the excellent advice. ",M2
17044080,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) polymorphism 4G/5G is associated with prostate cancer among men with a positive family history.BACKGROUND: Variation in the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) is associated with many human diseases, including several types of cancer. In particular, tumor cell overexpression of PAI-1 has been found to inhibit prostate cancer tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in mouse models. Normal host cell expression of PAI-1 is influenced by the 4G/5G insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the PAI-1 gene. To evaluate the effect of PAI-1 expression on cancer development, we examined the association of the 4G/5G polymorphism in a sibling-based case-control study of prostate cancer. METHODS: One thousand one hundred thirty seven subjects, 655 cases, and 482 sibling controls from 526 families, were recruited from the major medical institutions in the greater Cleveland, <e>OH</e> area and from the Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI. A Cox age-of-onset model with robust variance estimation was used to evaluate the association between the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism and prostate cancer. RESULTS: No association was observed between the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism and prostate cancer in the entire sample. We did, however, identify a statistically significant association between the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism and prostate cancer in subjects with a family history of this disease (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.02-1.61, P-value = 0.036). The PAI-1 5G/5G genotype, associated with lower PAI-1 expression, appears to drive this result as it was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer and an earlier mean age of onset compared to those with the 4G/4G genotype (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.12-2.99) while the 4G/5G genotype group did not show a significant difference in prostate cancer risk compared to the 4G/4G genotype group (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.75-1.28). CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that the 4G/5G polymorphism in PAI-1 may explain some of the increased risk and earlier mean age of onset of prostate cancer due to a positive family history.",M2

Field sampling took place in selected counties in North Carolina (NC) and Ohio (<e>OH</e>) in 2000-2001. Over a 48-h period in each child's daycare center and/or home, food, beverages, indoor air, outdoor air, house dust, soil, participants' hand surfaces and urine were sampled. Additional samples-transferable residues, food preparation surface wipes, and hard floor surface wipes-were collected in the approximately 13% of the homes that had pesticide applications within the 7 days prior to field sampling. Three phenols were among the measured chemicals: pentachlorophenol (PCP), bisphenol-A [2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane], and nonylphenol (4-n-nonylphenol). Nonylphenol (NP) was detected in less than 11% of the samples in any medium. Among samples that were collected at all participants' homes and daycare centers, PCP was detected in &gt;50% of indoor air, outdoor air, house dust, and urine samples; bisphenol-A (BPA) was detected in &gt;50% of indoor air, hand wipe, solid food, and liquid food samples. The concentrations of the phenols in the sampled media were measured, and the children's potential exposures and potential absorbed doses resulting from intake through the inhalation, dietary ingestion, and indirect ingestion routes of exposure were estimated. The children's potential exposures to PCP were predominantly through inhalation: 78% in NC and 90% in OH. In contrast, their potential exposures to BPA were predominantly through dietary ingestion: 99%, for children in both states. The children's estimated exposures to PCP, calculated from the amounts excreted in their urine, exceeded their estimated maximum potential intake, calculated from the multimedia PCP concentrations, by a factor greater than 10. This inconsistency for PCP highlights the need for further research on the environmental pathways and routes of PCP exposure, investigation of possible exposures to other compounds that could be metabolized to PCP, and on the human absorption, metabolism, and excretion of this phenol over time periods longer than 48 h.",M2

16573195,"Evaluation of ozone-nitrogen oxides-volatile organic compound sensitivity of Cincinnati, Ohio.Ambient concentrations of ozone (O3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), total reactive nitrogen (NOy), nitric acid (HNO3), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were measured during September 2003 at an urban site of Cincinnati, <e>OH</e>. The aim of this study was two-fold: to investigate whether O3 formation in this population exposure-type site is NOx, sensitive or volatile organic compound (VOC) sensitive and to test the practicality of using two combined observational-based methods to identify the sensitivity of O3 formation in midlevel polluted locations. The evaluation of the indicator species: NOy, O3/NOy, O3/HNO3, H2O2/ HNO3, and O3/(estimated NOx reaction products), as well as the combined hypothesis testing analysis of the weekend/weekday (WE/WD) differences of 1-hr and 8-hr average maximum O3 and of the 6:00 a.m.-9:00 a.m. average nitric oxide and NOx concentrations, show evidence that Cincinnati is likely VOC sensitive. Average WE 1-hr and 8-hr maximum O3, as well as duration of WE O3 accumulation, were not lower than the corresponding WD levels in spite of the observed significant reduction in NO, emissions on WE, a typical situation in VOC-sensitive locations. The possibility that the seasonal transition from summer to autumn could have influenced the results was also investigated through an exploratory analysis of the afternoon O3 maximum/NOx measured and of the WE/WD differences of peak O3 and morning average NO and NO, concentrations observed at this site from June through September 2003. The results suggest that a VOC-sensitive chemistry regime dominated along the summer season. The findings of this study suggest that additional reductions in regional NO, emissions in Cincinnati, a potential nonattainment area under the 8-hr O3 standard, may cause an increase in local O3. Future strategies to reduce O3 in Southwest Ohio should be further evaluated carefully. The combination of observational-based methods might provide a consistent complementary approach in the identification of the NO,-VOC sensitive characteristics of mid-to-moderate polluted urban areas.",M2

16395097,"Serogroup 19 pneumococci containing both mef and erm macrolide resistance determinants in an American city.BACKGROUND: Asia has experienced a striking incidence of infection by highly resistant pneumococi containing both principal macrolide resistance determinants, namely, the mef efflux pump and the erm ribosomal methylase. mef/erm-containing pneumococci have not been identified in significant numbers in North America. METHODS: Pneumococci were isolated as part of a larger study in Cleveland, <e>OH</e> examining colonization patterns among children randomized to 1 of 4 outpatient antibiotics for acute otitis media. Azithromycin-resistant organisms were tested for the presence of mef and erm sequences by polymerase chain reaction. The clonal relationship of pneumococci containing both genes was determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence testing. Selected characteristics of children harboring mef/erm-containing organisms were compared with other participants of the larger study. RESULTS: Of 221 children colonized by pneumococci, 17 (7.7%) were colonized with an organism containing both determinants. All mef/erm-positive organisms demonstrated azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations &gt; or =256 microg/mL and were coresistant to all other agents tested. The mef/erm-containing organisms were serotype 19A and 19F, all but 1 of which manifested similar pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns. Multilocus sequence testing analysis indicated a relationship to the Taiwan-14 macrolide-resistant strain that has spread throughout Eastern Asia. More than one-third of children colonized by a mef/erm-containing organism had received &gt; or =1 dose of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine, a significantly higher proportion than children carrying less resistant organisms (P&lt; 0.01). No other characteristics distinguished children harboring a mef/erm-containing pneumococcus from other children enrolled in the larger study. CONCLUSION: Clonally related mef/erm-containing serogroup 19 pneumococci were prominent among otherwise healthy children in a North American metropolitan area. Our findings suggest that spread of these organisms may be poorly contained by immunization.",M2

Baseline assessment data are entered directly into an Access database form (Microsoft, Inc, Seattle, WA). Quarterly, updated weight and lab data are downloaded into the database from the Epicare electronic medical record (Epic Systems Corp, Madison, WI). This system has enabled staff to track outcomes of program participants on an ongoing basis. To date, 438 patients have been entered into the program database, though complete clinical data are not available for all patients. Mean (+/-standard deviation) baseline body mass index of program participants was 35.8+/-9.1 (range 18.0 to 70.0, n=261). Mean (+/-standard deviation) baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for all patients was 9.5%+/-2.5%, range 4.5% to 18.3% (n=332). Median baseline HbA1c was 9.1%, and the median last available postprogram HbA1c was 7.5% (P&lt;.001, n=216; patients ranged from 90 days to more than 3 years postprogram entry).

16276567,"HIV substance abusers encouraged to use new case management program. Study shows program works.A strength-based case management program for HIV-positive patients who are active substance abusers appears to have some success in directing some patients to HIV care and treatment, according to recent research. For about 15 years, Ohio behavioral scientists have used a strength-based case management model with substance abusers, having case managers meet with them over a nine month period with the purpose of improving their health care outcomes. What we found in summary is, indeed, case management did lead to better outcomes, including less involvement in criminal activity and lower levels of drug use, says Richard C. Rapp, MSW, assistant professor in the department of community health at School of Medicine, Wright State University in Dayton, <e>OH</e>. Rapp also is with the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Addiction Research (CITAR) in Dayton.  Case management seemed to help keep people in treatment, and longer treatment led to better outcomes,  Rapp says.  So that's our rallying cry for case management.  With encouragement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of Atlanta, GA, Rapp and co-investigators developed a model of strength-based case management that was studied in the antiretroviral treatment and access study (ARTAS), which ran from 2003 to 2004.",M2

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study comprising of patients diagnosed with colon cancer from 1990 to 2002 and had their data reported to the TriHealth Tumor Registry, Cincinnati, <e>OH</e>. We classified the colon cancer into one of four stages: carcinoma in situ (CIS), local, regional, and distant disease. RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 2891 patients (1467 women and 1424 men). The women with colon cancer were significantly older and more likely to be single or widowed; in addition, more of them were African American (p &lt; 0.05). The men with colon cancer were more likely to smoke tobacco and consume alcohol (p &lt; 0.05). There was no difference between the genders for family history of colon cancer (8.5% vs. 9.6%). We found that women were significantly less likely to have CIS compared with men (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.09-0.85). Women also possessed a nonsignificant decrease in local disease. In contrast, the women showed significantly more regional disease than men (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.30) and had a non-significant increase in distant disease.

16094824,"Isolation and characterization of H3N2 influenza A virus from turkeys.Five 34-wk-old turkey breeder layer flocks in separate houses of 2550 birds each in a single farm in Ohio experienced a drop in egg production from late January to early February 2004. Tracheal swabs (n = 60), cloacal swabs (n = 50), and convalescent sera (n = 110) from the flocks were submitted to the laboratory for diagnostics. Virus isolation was attempted in specific-pathogen free embryonating chicken eggs and Vero and MDCK cells. Virus characterization was performed using agar gel immunodiffusion, the hemagglutination test, the hemagglutination inhibition test, the virus neutralization test, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. A presumptive influenza virus was successfully propagated and isolated on the first passage in MDCK cells, but initially not in Vero cells or specific-pathogen free chicken embryos. After two passages in MDCK cells, it was possible to propagate the isolate in specific-pathogen free chicken embryos. Preliminary sequence analysis of the isolated virus confirmed that it was influenza A virus with almost 100% (235/236) identity with the matrix gene of a swine influenza A virus, A/Swine/Illinois/100084/01 (H1N2). However, it was not possible to subtype the virus using conventional serotyping methods. The results of genetic characterization of the isolated virus showed that it was the H3N2 subtype and was designated as A/Turkey/<e>OH</e>/313053/04 (H3N2). Phylogenetic analysis of the eight gene segments of the virus showed that A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2) isolate was most closely related to the triple-reassortant H3N2 swine viruses [A/Swine/WI/14094/99 (H3N2)] that have been circulating among pigs in the United States since 1998, which contains gene segments from avian, swine, and human viruses. The A/Turkey/OH/313053/04 (H3N2) isolated from turkeys in this study was classified as a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus because it only caused a drop in egg production with minor other clinical signs and no mortality.",M2
15991665,"The Steubenville Comprehensive Air Monitoring Program (SCAMP): analysis of short-term and episodic variations in PM2.5 concentrations using hourly air monitoring data.One-hour average ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter &lt; 2.5 microm (PM2.5) were determined in Steubenville, <e>OH</e>, between June 2000 and May 2002 with a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM). Hourly average gaseous copollutant [carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and ozone (O3)] concentrations and meteorological conditions also were measured. Although 75% of the 14,682 hourly PM2.5 concentrations measured during this period were &lt; or = 17 microg/m3, concentrations &gt; 65 microg/m3 were observed 76 times. On average, PM2.5 concentrations at Steubenville exhibited a diurnal pattern of higher early morning concentrations and lower afternoon concentrations, similar to the diurnal profiles of CO and NO(x). This pattern was highly variable; however, PM2.5 concentrations &gt; 65 microg/m3 were never observed during the mid-afternoon between 1:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST. Twenty-two episodes centered on one or more of these elevated concentrations were identified. Five episodes occurred during the months June through August; the maximum PM2.5 concentration during these episodes was 76.6 microg/m3. Episodes occurring during climatologically cooler months often featured higher peak concentrations (five had maximum concentrations between 95.0 and 139.6 microg/m3), and many exhibited strong covariation between PM2.5 and CO, NO(x), or SO2. Case studies suggested that nocturnal surface-based temperature inversions were influential in driving high nighttime concentrations of these species during several cool season episodes, which typically had dramatically lower afternoon concentrations. These findings provide insights that may be useful in the development of PM2.5 reduction strategies for Steubenville, and suggest that studies assessing possible health effects of PM2.5 should carefully consider exposure issues related to the intraday timing of PM2.5 episodes, as well as the potential for toxicological interactions among PM2.5, and primary gaseous pollutants.",M2
15963911,"Vitamin D deficiency in adolescent females.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(<e>OH</e>)D] levels in adolescent girls and across racial groups and seasons. METHODS: Healthy postmenarcheal girls (12-18 years of age) were recruited for the study. Serum samples were assayed for 25(OH)D with a competitive protein binding assay (CPB) (Nichols Institute, San Clemente, California). RESULTS: The study included 370 girls (mean age, 15.5 +/- 1.6 y), with a mean serum 25(OH)D level of 53.7(29.0) nmol/L. Seventeen percent of the girls were found to be vitamin D deficient (serum 25(OH)D &lt;or= 27.5 nmol/L) and 54% were vitamin D insufficient (serum 25(OH)D &lt;or= 50 nmol/L) using the CPB assay. There was a significant difference in mean serum 25(OH)D levels between the African-American girls (43.0 nmol/L) and non-African-American girls (72.2 nmol/L) (p &lt; .0001). Mean vitamin D levels were higher in the spring/summer months (60.2 nmol/L) compared with those obtained during the fall/winter months (52.8 nmol/L) (p &lt; .01), and weight was correlated negatively with vitamin D levels (r = -.19) (p = .0002). CONCLUSIONS: For adolescent girls living in the northeastern United States, especially African-American girls, low 25(OH)D levels are a noteworthy concern because bone acquisition is crucial during this period of development.",M2
15928537,"Facet tropism and interfacet shape in the thoracolumbar vertebrae: characterization and biomechanical interpretation.STUDY DESIGN: Thoracolumbar facet and interfacet linear dimensions were measured and analyzed. OBJECTIVE: To characterize and analyze the thoracolumbar facet and interfacet size and shape in relation to gender, ethnic group, and age and to detect the extent of normal facet tropism along the thoracolumbar spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Knowledge on facet tropism and interfacet shape is limited in the literature as most data are based on 2-dimensional measurements, small samples, or isolated vertebrae. METHODS: Facet shape as represented by width, length, width/length ratio and interfacet distances was obtained directly from dry vertebrae of 240 adult human spines. The specimen's osteologic material is part of the Hamann-Todd Osteological Collection housed at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Cleveland, <e>OH</e>. A total of 4080 vertebrae (T1-L5) from the vertebral columns of individuals 20 to 80 years of age were measured, using a Microscribe 3-dimensional apparatus (Immersion Co., San Jose, CA). Data were recorded directly on computer software. Statistical analysis included paired t tests and ANOVA. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between all thoracolumbar facet dimensions and an individual's height and weight. Facet tropism is a major characteristic of the thoracolumbar spine, the left being longer in the thorax while the right is longer in the lumbar. In general, facet size is age-independent and greater in males compared with females with a significant ethnic component. Facet length is similar for all thoracic vertebrae, whereas it sharply and continuously increases in the lumbar vertebrae. Facet dimension manifests a bipolar distribution along the thoracolumbar vertebrae. Width/length ratio indicates that facets are longer than wider for most verte-brae. The interarticular area manifests a marked inverted trapezoidal shape at T1-T2, a rectangular shape at T3-L3, and an ordinary trapezoidal shape at L4-L5. CONCLUSIONS: Facet tropism is a normal characteristic in humans, yet it varies along the thoracolumbar spine.",M2
15887891,"The Steubenville comprehensive air monitoring program (SCAMP): associations among fine particulate matter, co-pollutants, and meteorological conditions.We determined 24-hr average ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and its ionic and carbonaceous components in Steubenville, <e>OH</e>, between May 2000 and May 2002. We also determined daily average gaseous co-pollutant concentrations, meteorological conditions, and pollen and mold spore counts. Data were analyzed graphically and by linear regression and time series models. Multiple-day episodes of elevated fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations often occurred during periods of locally high temperature (especially during summer), high pressure, or low wind speed (especially during winter) and generally ended with the passage of a frontal system. After removing autocorrelation, we observed statistically significant positive associations between concentrations of PM2.5 and concentrations of CO, NOx, and SO2. Associations with NOx and CO exhibited significant seasonal dependencies, with the strongest correlations during fall and winter. NOx, CO, SO2, O3, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed were all significant predictors of PM2.5 concentration in a time-series model with external regressors, which successfully accounted for 79% of the variance in log-transformed daily PM2.5 concentrations. Coefficient estimates for NOx and temperature varied significantly by season. The results provide insight that may be useful in the development of future PM2.5 reduction strategies for Steubenville. Additionally, they demonstrate the need for PM epidemiology studies in Steubenville (and elsewhere) to carefully consider the potential confounding effects of gaseous co-pollutants, such as CO and NOx, and their seasonally dependent associations with PM2.5.",M2
15887890,"The Steubenville comprehensive air monitoring program (SCAMP): overview and statistical considerations.Average concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microm (PM2.5) in Steubenville, <e>OH</e>, have decreased by more than 10 microg/m3 since the landmark Harvard Six Cities Study associated the city's elevated PM2.5 concentrations with adverse health effects in the 1980s. Given the promulgation of a new National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for PM2.5 in 1997, a current assessment of PM2.5 in the Steubenville region is warranted. The Steubenville Comprehensive Air Monitoring Program (SCAMP) was conducted from 2000 through 2002 to provide such an assessment. The program included both an outdoor ambient air monitoring component and an indoor and personal air sampling component. This paper, which is the first in a series of four that will present results from the outdoor portion of SCAMP, provides an overview of the outdoor ambient air monitoring program and addresses statistical issues, most notably autocorrelation, that have been overlooked by many PM2.5 data analyses. The average PM2.5 concentration measured in Steubenville during SCAMP (18.4 microg/m3) was 3.4 microg/m3 above the annual PM2.5 NAAQS. On average, sulfate and organic material accounted for approximately 31% and 25%, respectively, of the total PM2.5 mass. Local sources contributed an estimated 4.6 microg/m3 to Steubenville's mean PM2.5 concentration. PM2.5 and each of its major ionic components were significantly correlated in space across all pairs of monitoring sites in the region, suggesting the influence of meteorology and long-range transport on regional PM2.5 concentrations. Statistically significant autocorrelation was observed among time series of PM2.5 and component data collected at daily and 1-in-4-day frequencies during SCAMP. Results of spatial analyses that accounted for autocorrelation were generally consistent with findings from previous studies that did not consider autocorrelation; however, these analyses also indicated that failure to account for autocorrelation can lead to incorrect conclusions about statistical significance.",M2
15749357,"Carbon monoxide-related deaths in a metropolitan county in the USA: an 11-year study.Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning as a cause of death is well documented in industrialized countries. The objective of this study was to compare demographic data in deaths due to accidents (in fires) and suicides in the same population between 1988 and 1998. Furthermore, the potential effect of a community wide education effort regarding safety in the home was assessed. Postmortem reports were reviewed for all deaths examined at the Office of the Cuyahoga County Coroner in Cleveland, <e>OH</e>, USA. During the study period, there were 209 accidental deaths due to fires in the home (6.5% of all accidents in the home) and 182 CO deaths by suicide (9.8% of all suicides). Demographic characteristics of the two groups differed: while males represented the majority of cases in both groups (55% of accidents, 70% suicides), race specific death rates were higher for whites than blacks (18/100,000 white, 3/100,000 black) in suicides compared with 29/100,000 deaths for blacks and 11/100,000 for whites in accidental cases. Fire deaths were prevalent in the young (0-9 years) and old (&gt;60) whereas in the suicide group the age specific death rate was highest for those over 70 years. The majority of fire deaths occurred in the city of Cleveland but suicides were prevalent in the suburbs. More fire deaths occurred in December than any other month whereas more suicides occurred in April. In 1992, there was a community wide effort to provide free smoke detectors to residents in Cleveland. In 1992, there were 4.2/100,000 fire deaths in the city. This decreased to 0.6/100,000 in 1996, increased to 1.2/100,000 in 1997 followed by a decrease to 0.8/100,000 in 1998. This suggested that the program may have aided in decreasing these types of deaths. Deaths due to fires in the suburbs were &lt;1/100,000 throughout the study period.",M2

15648759,"An in situ toxicity identification evaluation method Part II: Field validation.When sediments are found to be toxic usually there is a mixture of chemicals present. Often it is important to establish which chemicals contribute to the toxicity. Establishing causality can be difficult and often requires fractionation with subsequent toxicity testing. The sample collection and manipulation process can alter chemical bioavailability and toxicity. An in situ toxicity identification evaluation (iTIE) chamber is described that was placed in sediments and fractionated pore-water chemicals into nonpolar chemicals, metals, and ammonia-type groups. This method was field tested and compared to the laboratory-based, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) method. Field studies were performed at three sites contaminated primarily with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Little Scioto River, <e>OH</e>, USA), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Dicks Creek, OH, USA), and chlorobenzenes (Sebasticook River, ME, USA). Both the iTIE and the U.S. EPA TIE methods used Daphnia magna in 24-h exposures. Although the iTIE and TIE were conducted on sediments from the same location, there was significantly more toxicity observed in the iTIE testing. The dominant chemical classes were separated by the iTIE method and revealed which fractions contributed to toxicity. The loss of toxicity in the TIE approach did not allow for subsequent fractionation and stressor identification. Advantages of the iTIE over the TIE method were greater sensitivity and ability to detect causative toxic chemical fractions; lack of sediment collection and subsequent manipulation; and, thus, reduction in potential artifacts, more realistic exposure with slow, continual pore-water renewal in situ, ability to evaluate pore waters in sandy or rocky substrates where pore waters are difficult to collect, and a quicker phase I evaluation. Limitations of the iTIE method as compared to the TIE methods were extensive pretest assembly process, fewer phase I fractionation possibilities, and restriction to shallow waters. The results of these studies suggest that the iTIE method provides a more accurate and sensitive evaluation of pore water toxicity than the laboratory TIE method.",M2
15543732,"Trace metal and major ion inputs into the Olentangy River from an urban storm sewer.Trace metal clean techniques were used to sample and analyze the input of dissolved trace metals, major ions, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from a storm sewer along an urban highway in Columbus, <e>OH</e>. The outfall, draining a 3.6 ha sewershed with 100% impermeable surface area, discharges into the Olentangy River. Dissolved Pb (average concentration of 3 nM) and dissolved Zn (average concentration of 127 nM) were found to be much lower in concentration than reported in previous investigations of dissolved metals in urban stormwater runoff. Average concentrations of dissolved Cr (1 microM), Ni (0.087 microM), and Cu (0.33 microM) were similar to those reported in previous studies. The storm sewer is shown to be a significant source of V, Ni, and Zn to the river. The outfall is also a significant source of Na, NH4, Cl, and DOC. The storm sewer input is depleted in NO2 and NO3 as compared to the river, reflecting the highly agricultural land use of the watershed upstream of the sewershed. Input from the storm sewer is also depleted, as compared to the river, with respect to dissolved Mg, Sr, and U with probable sources in the limestone/shale bedrock and glacial till-derived soils in the watershed.",M2
15473544,"Assessing the relative severity of stressors at a watershed scale.Water quality monitoring data are usually used independently to report on the condition of streams and watersheds. For example, watersheds are often rated as good, fair, or poor with regard to a single stressor or with regard to an index of biotic integrity. The utility of monitoring data may be enhanced by integrating stressor-response information with the observed stressor data, and reporting stressor levels in terms of their relative effects upon valued ecological resources. We estimated stressor-response relationships at the regional scale using data collected in the Eastern Cornbelt Plains Ecoregion of Ohio. Generalized additive models were used to visualize stressor-response relationships. Piecewise linear functions and simple linear functions were then used to parameterize the observed responses. Parameters derived from the regional models were used to scale observations of stressors in the Big Darby Creek watershed, <e>OH</e>. After scaling, stressors were compared in terms of their spatial distribution and in terms of the severity with which they influenced the biological endpoint of interest. Stressors most strongly associated with the current ecological condition of the watershed were identified. In the Big Darby Creek watershed, decreases in substrate quality were associated with the most severe decrements in biological condition. At smaller decrements in biological condition, three stressors were important: substrate quality, riparian quality, and increased concentrations of NOx.",M2
15253863,"The use of dietary supplements by veterans with cancer.OBJECTIVE: To study the patterns of dietary supplement use in veterans with cancer. DESIGN: Using a detailed questionnaire, a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the patterns of dietary supplement use by patients with cancer. SETTING/LOCATION: The study was conducted at the Hematology/ Oncology Clinic at the VA Hospital in Cincinnati, <e>OH</e>. SUBJECTS: Patients with malignancy who were attending the above clinic and willing to participate and sign a consent form were enrolled in the study. OUTCOMES/MEASURES: The use of dietary supplements, the type, frequency, and reason for use was captured, along with the source of dietary supplements and perceived benefits. RESULTS: Two hundred (200) veterans were surveyed, with a median age of 68 years (36-82). The type of malignancy included cancer of the genitourinary system (39.5%), lung (19.5%), gastrointestinal tract (14.5%), hematologic system (16%), skin/head/neck (6.5%), and other (4%). One hundred and twenty-two patients (122) used dietary supplements (61%). Multivitamins were the most commonly used dietary supplement reported by 98 patients (80.3%), followed by mineral use by 52 patients (40.6%). Ten (10) patients used herbal supplements. Patients who were employed and patients with higher education were more likely to use dietary supplements. Different reasons were given for dietary supplement use and 74% of the users reported perceived benefits, such as improved overall health and energy. While 38% of the patients did not disclose dietary supplement use to their physicians, 37.8% of them learned about dietary supplements from their physicians and 25% obtained their dietary supplements from the VA hospital. CONCLUSION: The use of dietary supplements is common among veterans with cancer. Health care professionals should inquire about them in a systematic fashion and be prepared to provide counseling to their patients about them.",M2

14744406,"Multiple patch-test reactions: a pilot evaluation of a combination approach to visualize patterns of multiple sensitivity in patch-test databases and a proposal for a multiple sensitivity index.BACKGROUND: The variety of patterns of multiple sensitivity in patch-test data remains poorly defined. Studies addressing this topic have primarily concerned the occurrence of pairs of allergens, and some reports hypothesize a predisposing factor that influences the individual sensitivity of patients to multiple reactions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to address this topic by reanalyzing a matched data set from two patch-test units in Cleveland, <e>OH</e>, and one unit in Cologne, Germany, focusing on multiple reactions to identical allergens of the standard screening trays over the same 4-year period. Methods: Based on the statistical FREQ procedure (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), we propose a program for addressing the difficulties in computing and visualizing patterns of multiple sensitivity. Additionally, we propose the  multiple sensitivity index  (MSI) as an absolute measure for characterizing the occurrence of an allergen with others on a selected panel. RESULTS: For the seventeen allergens examined, 131072 possible combinations were evaluated in a total of 2881 patients. Of patients tested, 12.4% had multiple positive patch-test reactions to two to seven allergens. However, because of the small number of patients with the crucial number of possible combinations, no cluster patterns were evident in the three- to seven-allergen combinations. Pairs of allergens most frequently observed were nickel sulfate and potassium dichromate (n = 23), formaldehyde and quaternium-15 (n = 18), and nickel sulfate and formaldehyde (n = 13). We found that nickel sulfate, once again the most frequent sensitizer, occurred in the majority of noncombined cases (MSI = -0.280). CONCLUSION: Larger patch-test databases require evaluation to obtain further evidence of cluster patterns of multiple sensitivity and to validate the MSI.",M2
14672642,"Neighborhood playgrounds, fast food restaurants, and crime: relationships to overweight in low-income preschool children.BACKGROUND: We examined the relationship between overweight in preschool children and three environmental factors--the proximity of the children's residences to playgrounds and to fast food restaurants and the safety of the children's neighborhoods. We hypothesized that children who lived farther from playgrounds, closer to fast food restaurants, and in unsafe neighborhoods were more likely to be overweight. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 7,020 low-income children, 36 through 59 months of age living in Cincinnati, <e>OH</e>. Overweight was defined as a measured body mass index &gt; or =95th percentile. The distance between each child's residence and the nearest public playground and fast food restaurant was determined with geographic information systems. Neighborhood safety was defined by the number of police-reported crimes per 1,000 residents per year in each of 46 city neighborhoods. RESULTS: Overall, 9.2% of the children were overweight, 76% black, and 23% white. The mean (+/- SD) distances from a child's home to the nearest playground and fast food restaurant were 0.31 (+/- 0.22) and 0.70 (+/- 0.38) miles, respectively. There was no association between child overweight and proximity to playgrounds, proximity to fast food restaurants, or level of neighborhood crime. The association between child overweight and playground proximity did not differ by neighborhood crime level. CONCLUSIONS: Within a population of urban low-income preschoolers, overweight was not associated with proximity to playgrounds and fast food restaurants or with the level of neighborhood crime.",M2

Plant. Closing of a coking plant in 1983 and environmental dredging of the sediments during 1989 and 1990 has reduced the PAH levels significantly. This study quantifies the decrease, and consider source apportionment of PAHs in Black River sediments using chemical mass balance modeling. Five vibra cores collected in 1998 and dated using 210Pb and 137Cs, were analyzed for 18 PAHs. The cores had total PAH concentrations between 250 and 0.10 ppm. PAH maxima occur in 1949, 1969, in accordance with regional historical inputs (core BR4), and in 1991 due to remediation (BR6). Coke oven emissions (CO), highway dust (HWY), and wood burning (WB) are likely sources. The CO source (6-92% of total PAHs) is maximal in 1954, and again in 1992-1994 due to the exposure and redistribution of older contaminated sediments during dredging, and decreases thereafter. There is minimal CO content in 1985 (BR4), 2 yr after closure of the coking plant. The HWY contribution (2-86%) is high during 1969-1988, and increases again after 1993. The WB source is less than 23%, and exhibits a minimum (2%) around 1979 (BR4).

12604905,"Prevalence and predictors of severity as defined by atlanta criteria among patients presenting with acute pancreatitis.INTRODUCTION: Effective triage of patients with acute pancreatitis is dependent on the ability to accurately predict a severe course. Predictors (e.g., APACHE II score of &gt;8) have been tested against wide-ranging definitions of severity (prevalence, 15%-40%). To ensure uniformity in defining a severe course of acute pancreatitis, the Atlanta symposium of 1992 adopted all-encompassing criteria (local complications, systemic complications, need for surgery, or death). AIMS: To assess the prevalence of each Atlanta criteria for severe acute pancreatitis and to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the APACHE II score as a predictor of these criteria for severe acute pancreatitis. METHODOLOGY: We reviewed records of patients admitted to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (Cincinnati, <e>OH</e>, U.S.A.) between 1994 and 1998 with acute pancreatitis. Exclusion criteria included referral from an outside hospital, immunocompromised state, and chronic pancreatitis. RESULTS: Seventy-four consecutive patients met our inclusion criteria. Ten patients (13.5%) had a severe course. Seven patients developed only local complications. Three patients had systemic complications. Pancreatic surgical intervention was required in four patients. No deaths occurred. An APACHE II score of &gt;8 exhibited 50% sensitivity and 69% specificity (positive predictive value, 20%; negative predictive value, 89%). All patients with systemic complications and two of seven patients with only local complications had an APACHE II score of &gt;8. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of severity among our nonreferred patients with acute pancreatitis was less than previously reported. The APACHE II scoring system exhibited reasonable sensitivity in predicting systemic complications and/or the need for surgery, with a low positive predictive value. This most certainly is a function of the low pretest probability of severe pancreatitis. Future studies attempting to identify predictive systems that triage patients in a more cost-effective manner should restrict their analysis to Atlanta criteria other than local complications.",M2
12558168,"Laboratory and field validation of multiple molecular biomarkers of contaminant exposure in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).Novel primers for three different genes (CYP1A1, vitellogenin, and metallothionein) for use in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were developed and tested in laboratory flow-through experiments using model compounds benzo[a]pyrene, estradiol, and cadmium. Field validations of the molecular biomarkers were performed using 8-d or 48-h in situ, cagedexposure of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Expression levels of genetranscription(messengerRNA [mRNA]) were monitored in gill and liver tissue after exposure at sites downstream of a known source of creosote contamination in the Little Scioto River (Marion, <e>OH</e>, USA) and metals and hydrocarbon contamination in Dick's Creek (Middletown, OH, USA). Significant increases of liver cytochrome P4501A1 gene (CYP1A1) and vitellogenin were measured in both streams at sites downstream of contaminant sources. Significant increases of gill CYP1A1 were also observed. Significant increases of gill and livermetallothionein occurred in Dick's Creek. A sample of gill tissue taken from each fish prior to placement in the Little Scioto River provided a pre-exposure control measurement for each individual. Expression of CYP1A1 and vitellogenin in trout at both streams indicated that exposure to bioavailable hydrocarbons and endocrine-disrupting compounds had taken place. Previous to this study, estrogenic compounds had not been detected in the Little Scioto River. Metallothionein expression confirmed the presence of metals in Dick's Creek. These results suggest a mixed contaminant environment that poses physiological hazard to existing teleost populations. Multiple molecular biomarkers provided a sensitive, physiologically based method of determining contaminant presence and bioavailability to aquatic organisms.",M2
12550084,"Air pollution and emergency department visits for asthma among Ohio Medicaid recipients, 1991-1996.We examined the effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)), particulate matter of &lt;10 microm aerodynamic diameter (PM(10)), and sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) on asthmatics ages 5-34 years enrolled in Medicaid in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus, <e>OH</e> (N=5416). Our study period was for the summer months, June-August, from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1996. We preformed Poisson regression analyses for the number of daily emergency department (ED) visits for asthma in each city and on the aggregate data controlling for time trends and minimum temperature. We found a 12% increased likelihood of an asthma ED visit per 50 microg/m(3) increase in PM(10) in Cleveland [95% confidence interval (CI)=0-27%] and a 35% increase per 50 microg/m(3) increase in SO(2) in Cincinnati (95% CI=9-21%). When data were analyzed for all three cities combined, the risk of an ED visit increased for all pollutant increases and specifically by 12% (95% CI=1-23%) per 50 microg/m(3) increase in SO(2). Attributable risk estimates show a five times greater impact on Cleveland over Cincinnati or Columbus. Between 1991 and 1996, air pollutants in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus increased ED visits for asthmatics enrolled in Medicaid.",M2
12549750,"Prevalence of reduced bone mass in children and adults with spastic quadriplegia.This study was designed to test the hypothesis that non-ambulatory patients with spastic quadriplegia will have reduced bone mass which worsens with increasing age. Forty-eight patients (age 5 to 48 years, median age 15 years; 19 females and 29 males) were studied. Anticonvulsants were used in 29 patients (60.4%). Lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD) was markedly reduced compared with age-and sex-matched control individuals with a z score of -2.37 +/- 0.21. Twenty-eight (58%) had z scores of less than -2. A history of documented previous fracture was present in 19 patients (39%). Patients with a history of fracture had significantly lower (p = 0.05) LS-BMD z scores (-2.81 +/- 0.29) compared with those without a history of fracture (-2.11 +/- 0.26). Mean serum 25-<e>OH</e> vitamin D was 29.6 +/- 1.9ng/mL (normal 9 to 37.6ng/mL) with three patients having serum 25-OH vitamin D levels less than 15ng/mL.

The purpose of the current study was to describe anticipated parental involvement and adolescent compliance with pill taking, and to describe experiences with a 20-mcg OC regarding satisfaction and side effects after six cycles. DESIGN: Anticipated parental involvement and anticipated compliance, and experiences with an OC, were assessed at baseline, and after the first and sixth cycles during a clinical trial of oral contraceptives, which required parental consent. SETTING: Three adolescent medicine clinics in New York, NY; Cincinnati, <e>OH</e>; and San Juan, Puerto Rico. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 43 female adolescents with a mean age of 17 years. RESULTS: The majority of adolescents living with a parent anticipated parental involvement, and few adolescents anticipated difficulties with consistent pill taking. For two side effects (weight and mood changes), more than 30% of the adolescents anticipated the occurrence or worsening of side effects. However, few adolescents actually experienced increases in any of the nine side effects assessed. Ninety-seven percent of adolescents in this trial reported being satisfied with a 20-mcg OC. CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers can assess adolescents' anticipated difficulties with compliance with daily pill taking, and desire for help from their parents. This information can be incorporated into counseling to promote consistent and correct use.",M2
12546334,"Relationship of outdoor air quality to pediatric asthma exacerbations.BACKGROUND: Although exposure to outdoor air pollutants has been shown to be associated with exacerbations of asthma, there are relatively few admissions for asthma to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, <e>OH</e> during the summer months when air quality tends to be worst. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of outdoor air quality parameters to asthma exacerbations in children. METHODS: The number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for asthma were determined by review of emergency department logs and the hospital computer database. Outdoor air concentrations of ozone, particulates of &lt; 10 microm diameter (PM-10), pollens, and fungal spores were obtained from the Hamilton County Department of Environmental Services. Multiple regression analysis was performed, looking for relationships between the daily number of asthma visits and the air quality data for the same day and for 1 through 5 days before the visits. RESULTS: A significant association was found between the number of asthma visits and the daily pollen count (P = 0.014, SE = 0.001). The effect was stronger for visits 1, 2, and 3 days after the pollen count (P &lt; 0.001 for pollen count lagged 3 days). High PM-10 counts were synergistic with the pollen count as a predictor of asthma visits. There was no association between asthma visits and the ozone concentration or fungal spore count. CONCLUSIONS: Exacerbations of asthma severe enough to require visits to the hospital were associated with elevated concentrations of airborne pollens and particulates, with a significant delayed effect. Ozone, in the concentrations measured here, was not a risk factor for severe asthma exacerbations in children.",M2
12389905,"Modeling polychlorinated biphenyl congener patterns and dechlorination in dated sediments from the Ashtabula River, Ohio, USA.Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were analyzed in four deep, dated sediment cores from the Ashtabula River (<e>OH</e>, USA), for the purpose of identifying relevant PCB sources and congener patterns. The time span for three of the cores is from the mid 1960s to 1998, whereas the fourth has a time span of six years. The total PCB concentrations are in the range of 0.4 to 6.8 microg/g dry weight, with the highest concentrations observed in samples from the 1970s. A factor analysis (FA) model with nonnegative constraints was used to investigate the sources and patterns of PCBs. Additionally, a new model, based on a least squares method, was developed to identify possible patterns of anaerobic dechlorination of PCBs in the sediments, and to quantify the relevant dechlorination pathways. Both models were validated successfully either by artificially created data sets (FA model) or by using laboratory data from the literature (dechlorination model). The FA model revealed two significant sources. The first was identified as a slightly altered Aroclor 1248. The second did not resemble any Aroclor closely, but was very similar to the overall average congener profile of all samples. Simulation of anaerobic dechlorination on an Aroclor 1248 profile from the literature, according to dechlorination activities H/H', as defined in the literature, yielded a congener profile very similar to that of the second pattern. This indicates the likelihood of anaerobic dechlorination of PCBs in Ashtabula River sediments.",M2
12069295,"Determining the causes of impairments in the Little Scioto River, Ohio, USA: part 2. Characterization of causes.Two stream reaches in the Little Scioto River (<e>OH</e>, USA) were characterized for the causes of impairments measured at two locations. By inductive inference, six candidate causes were winnowed down to three and five candidate causes for each of the two stream reaches. Using a formal strength-of-evidence process, a single cause was determined. At the most upstream location, habitat alterations, including fine-textured substrates and low DO, were characterized as the probable causes for an increased percentage of anomalies of fish, a decreased percentage of mayflies, and an increased percentage of tolerant macroinvertebrates. An increase in the relative weight of fish was attributed to an artificially narrow, deepened channel. Approximately 2 km downstream, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated sediments were identified as the cause for both fish and macroinvertebrate impairments. Causal characterization using first elimination and then a strength-of-evidence approach narrowed and defined the causes of ecological impairment even in this situation, where many complex and interacting candidate causes existed. Applying a formal method highlighted types of data and associations that can strengthen and present a more convincing determination of the causes of impairment.",M2

11890494,"Racial and state differences in the designation of advance directives in nursing home residents.OBJECTIVES: To examine racial and state differences in the use of advance directives and surrogate decision-making in a nursing home population. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Nursing homes in the states of California (CA), Massachusetts (MA), New York (NY), and Ohio (<e>OH</e>). PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents: 130,308 in CA, 59,691 in MA, 112,080 in NY, and 98,954 in OH. MEASUREMENTS: Minimum Data Set information concerning resident race and whether or not residents have a living will (LW), a do not resuscitate (DNR) order, or a surrogate decision-maker (SDM). RESULTS: The proportion of LWs, DNR orders, and SDMs varied significantly (P &lt; .0001) by racial categories in each state. In general, whites were distinctly different from other racial categories. Whites were significantly more likely to have a LW (odds ratio (OR) = 1.9 (CA), OR = 2.2 (NY), OR = 4.9 (OH)), a DNR order (OR = 2.4 (CA), OR = 2.4 (MA), OR = 3.3 (NY), OR = 3.2 (OH)), and a SDM (OR = 1.1 (CA), OR = 1.2 (NY), OR = 1.6 (OH)) than were nonwhites, after adjusting for potentially confounding factors. Significant state differences (P &lt; .0001) were observed in LWs, DNR orders, and SDMs and were most pronounced in residents of Ohio, who were significantly more likely to have a LW than were residents in other states (OR = 9.3). CONCLUSIONS: Various resident characteristics explain some of the racial differences, although whites are still more likely to have a LW, a DNR order, or an SDM independent of various resident characteristics included in the adjusted analyses. This pattern is observed in all states, although the ORs varied by state. Some of these differences may be due to distinct cultural approaches to end-of-life care and lack of knowledge and understanding of advance directives. The distinctly higher rates of LWs among all racial groups in Ohio than in other states suggest that states can potentially increase the use of advance directives through intervention.",M2

GOHAI was self-administered to two samples of elderly individuals, over 65 years of age, in the Columbus, <e>OH</e>, area. The first sample was ambulatory individuals living in a nursing home in Columbus, and the second sample consisted of patients accessing dental care at The Ohio State University (OSU) dental school clinics. Other variables used in this study were age, gender, self-rated oral and general health, and use of prostheses. Overall mean GOHAI score in the nursing home respondents was significantly higher (32.1 +/- 3.0) when compared with that of dental patients (mean, 30.4 +/- 3.9, p = 0.01). Mean GOHAI scores for all categories of variables used were consistently higher (better) in the nursing home respondents than for the dental patients.

METHODS: Retrospective chart review of cases with a verifiable chief complaint of caries-related dental pain in 1998, was conducted using established protocol and trained reviewers. RESULTS: Three hundred of 984 hospital ED dental emergencies met the study's selection criteria and 109 children were six years old or younger. Almost two-thirds (66%) came from single parent families. Fifty-eight percent were self-pay or covered by government programs and the rest had some insurance. African-American children were 45% of cases. Over 80% were from within Franklin County, <e>OH</e>. Only 4 children (1%) had been seen for the same tooth previously. Lower primary molars were most often affected. Race, insurance, parental marital status were not significantly related to follow-up attendance at the facility (P &gt; 0.05).

In bench-scale tests, process parameters were developed for the optimal treatment of the Miami Erie Canal soil at the Mound site, combining the maximum plutonium removal with an acceptable amount of soil dissolution and minimizing the costs of reagents. Parameters evaluated included soil to extractant mass ratio, temperature, rinse solution composition, kinetics, and the application of several dewatering aids. Plutonium removal rates of &gt;95% were achieved, and the residual plutonium in the treated soil proved to be very immobile-confirming that the process had removed the most accessible species of the radionuclide. Currently being tested at Mound is an engineering scale-up that includes an attrition scrubber, a counter-current extractor, and a reverse osmosis system. Economic evaluations based on bench-scale results put the treatment cost at US$278/yd(3) (US$364/m3), compared to US$350/yd(3) (US$458/m3) for the 'box-and-bury' baseline alternative treatment system.",M2

Educational curricula for cross-training, screening tools, and referral protocols were developed and tested for staff and volunteers in adult protective services and dementia care. A handbook for caregivers of persons with dementia was produced that enables caregivers to self-identify elder abuse risk and seek appropriate interventions to prevent abuse. Project organization, implementation, and evaluation are discussed along with strategies for replication in other communities.",M2
