20182458,"<e>WASP</e>: a key immunological multitasker.The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) is an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton that is required for many haematopoietic and immune cell functions, including effective migration, phagocytosis and immune synapse formation. Loss of WASP activity leads to Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an X-linked disease that is associated with defects in a broad range of cellular processes, resulting in complex immunodeficiency, autoimmunity and microthrombocytopenia. Intriguingly, gain of function mutations cause a separate disease that is mainly characterized by neutropenia. Here, we describe recent insights into the cellular mechanisms of these two related, but distinct, human diseases and discuss their wider implications for haematopoiesis, immune function and autoimmunity.",M1
20159256,"Revertant T lymphocytes in a patient with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: analysis of function and distribution in lymphoid organs.BACKGROUND: The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare genetic disease characterized by thrombocytopenia, immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and hematologic malignancies. Secondary mutations leading to re-expression of WAS protein (<e>WASP</e>) are relatively frequent in patients with WAS. OBJECTIVE: The tissue distribution and function of revertant cells were investigated in a novel case of WAS gene secondary mutation. METHODS: A vast combination of approaches was used to characterize the second-site mutation, to investigate revertant cell function, and to track their distribution over a 18-year clinical follow-up. RESULTS: The WAS gene secondary mutation was a 4-nucleotide insertion, 4 nucleotides downstream of the original deletion. This somatic mutation allowed the T-cell-restricted expression of a stable, full-length WASP with a 3-amino acid change compared with the wild-type protein. WASP(+) T cells appeared early in the spleen (age 10 years) and were highly enriched in a mesenteric lymph node at a later time (age 23 years). Revertant T cells had a diversified T-cell-receptor repertoire and displayed in vitro and in vivo selective advantage. They proliferated and produced cytokines normally on T-cell-receptor stimulation. Consistently, the revertant WASP correctly localized to the immunologic synapse and to the leading edge of migrating T cells. CONCLUSION: Despite the high proportion of functional revertant T cells, the patient still has severe infections and autoimmune disorders, suggesting that re-expression of WASP in T cells is not sufficient to normalize immune functions fully in patients with WAS.",M1
20130240,"Impaired NK-cell migration in WAS/XLT patients: role of Cdc42/<e>WASp</e> pathway in the control of chemokine-induced beta2 integrin high-affinity state.We analyzed the involvement of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp), a critical regulator of actin cytoskeleton remodeling, in the control of natural killer (NK)-cell migration. NK cells derived from patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome/X-linked thrombocytopenia (WAS/XLT), carrying different mutations in the WASP coding gene, displayed reduced migration through intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), or endothelial cells in response to CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor-1 and CX3CL1/fractalkine. Inhibition of WAS/XLT NK-cell migration was associated with reduced ability of these cells to up-regulate the expression of CD18 activation neoepitope and to adhere to ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 following chemokine stimulation. Moreover, chemokine receptor or beta1 or beta2 integrin engagement on NK cells rapidly resulted in Cdc42 activation and WASp tyrosine phosphorylation as well as in WASp association with Fyn and Pyk-2 tyrosine kinases. NK-cell pretreatment with wiskostatin, to prevent Cdc42/WASp association, impaired chemokine-induced NK-cell migration through ICAM-1 and beta2 integrin activation-dependent neoepitope expression. These results show that the Cdc42/WASp pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of NK-cell migration by acting as a critical component of the chemokine-induced inside-out signaling that regulates lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 function and suggest that after integrin or chemokine receptor engagement WASp function is regulated by the coordinate action of both Cdc42 and tyrosine kinases.",M1
20129922,"Mechanism of aldolase control of sorting nexin 9 function in endocytosis.Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) functions in a complex with the GTPase dynamin-2 at clathrin-coated pits, where it provokes fission of vesicles to complete endocytosis. Here the SNX9.dynamin-2 complex binds to clathrin and adapter protein complex 2 (AP-2) that line these pits, and this occurs through interactions of the low complexity domain (LC4) of SNX9 with AP-2. Intriguingly, localization of the SNX9.dynamin-2 complex to clathrin-coated pits is blocked by interactions with the abundant glycolytic enzyme aldolase, which also binds to the LC4 domain of SNX9. The crystal structure of the LC4 motif of human SNX9 in complex with aldolase explains the biochemistry and biology of this interaction, where SNX9 binds near the active site of aldolase via residues 165-171 that are also required for the interactions of SNX9 with AP-2. Accordingly, SNX9 binding to aldolase is structurally precluded by the binding of substrate to the active site. Interactions of SNX9 with aldolase are far more extensive and differ from those of the actin-nucleating factor <e>WASP</e> with aldolase, indicating considerable plasticity in mechanisms that direct the functions of the aldolase as a scaffold protein.",M1
20123155,"Somatic mosaicism in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: molecular and functional characterization of genotypic revertants.The reasons underlying the occurrence of multiple revertant genotypes in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients remain unclear. We have identified more than 30 revertant genotypes in a C995T WAS patient having 10-15% revertant, WAS protein (<e>WASp</e>)-expressing circulating lymphocytes. Of 497 allospecific T-cell clones generated from the peripheral blood, 47.1% carried a revertant sequence. All revertant T-cell clones exhibited restoration of WASp expression. However, anti-CD3-induced proliferative responses varied greatly amongst revertants. Several revertant T-cell clones expressed an internally deleted WASp mutant lacking much of the proline-rich region. This potentially accounts for the reduced anti-CD3 proliferative responses of these T-cell clones. We found no evidence for an increased DNA mutation rate in this patient. We conclude that the diversity of revertant genotypes in our patient does not result from an extraordinary mutation rate and that the amino acid sequence space explored by WASp in revertant T-cells is significantly smaller than might have been predicted from the diversity of revertant genotypes.",M1
20071778,"Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein modulates Wnt signaling and is required for hair follicle cycling in mice.The Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 are critical regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and are essential for skin and hair function. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family proteins act downstream of these GTPases, controlling actin assembly and cytoskeletal reorganization, but their role in epithelial cells has not been characterized in vivo. Here, we used a conditional knockout approach to assess the role of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-<e>WASP</e>), the ubiquitously expressed Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome-like (WASL) protein, in mouse skin. We found that N-WASP deficiency in mouse skin led to severe alopecia, epidermal hyperproliferation, and ulceration, without obvious effects on epidermal differentiation and wound healing. Further analysis revealed that the observed alopecia was likely the result of a progressive and ultimately nearly complete block in hair follicle (HF) cycling by 5 months of age. N-WASP deficiency also led to abnormal proliferation of skin progenitor cells, resulting in their depletion over time. Furthermore, N-WASP deficiency in vitro and in vivo correlated with decreased GSK-3beta phosphorylation, decreased nuclear localization of beta-catenin in follicular keratinocytes, and decreased Wnt-dependent transcription. Our results indicate a critical role for N-WASP in skin function and HF cycling and identify a link between N-WASP and Wnt signaling. We therefore propose that N-WASP acts as a positive regulator of beta-catenin-dependent transcription, modulating differentiation of HF progenitor cells.",M1
20071330,"The p40/ARPC1 subunit of Arp2/3 complex performs multiple essential roles in <e>WASp</e>-regulated actin nucleation.The Arp2/3 complex is a conserved seven-subunit actin-nucleating machine activated by WASp (Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein). Despite its central importance in a broad range of cellular processes, many critical aspects of the mechanism of the Arp2/3 complex have yet to be resolved. In particular, some of the individual subunits in the complex have not been assigned clear functional roles, including p40/ARPC1. Here, we dissected the structure and function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae p40/ARPC1, which is encoded by the essential ARC40 gene, by analyzing 39 integrated alleles that target its conserved surfaces. We identified three distinct sites on p40/ARPC1 required for function in vivo: one site contacts p19/ARPC4, one contacts p15/ARPC5, and one site resides in an extended structural  arm  of p40/ARPC1. Using a novel strategy, we purified the corresponding lethal mutant Arp2/3 complexes from yeast and compared their actin nucleation activities. Lethal mutations at the contact with p19/ARPC4 specifically impaired WASp-induced nucleation. In contrast, lethal mutations at the contact with p15/ARPC5 led to unregulated ( leaky ) nucleation in the absence of WASp. Lethal mutations in the extended arm drastically reduced nucleation, and the same mutations disrupted the ability of the purified p40/ARPC1 arm domain to bind the VCA domain of WASp. Together, these data indicate that p40/ARPC1 performs at least three distinct, essential functions in regulating Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly: 1) suppression of spontaneous nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex, which requires proper contacts with p15/ARPC5; 2) propagation of WASp activation signals via contacts with p19/ARPC2; and 3) direct facilitation of actin nucleation through interactions of the extended arm with the VCA domain of WASp.",M1
20032499,"Critical requirement for the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein in Th2 effector function.Patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) have numerous immune cell deficiencies, but it remains unclear how abnormalities in individual cell types contribute to the pathologies of WAS. In T cells, the WAS protein (<e>WASp</e>) regulates actin polymerization and transcription, and plays a role in the dynamics of the immunologic synapse. To examine how these events influence CD4 function, we isolated the WASp deficiency to CD4(+) T cells by adoptive transfer into wild-type mice to study T-cell priming and effector function. WAS(-/-) CD4(+) T cells mediated protective T-helper 1 (Th1) responses to Leishmania major in vivo, but were unable to support Th2 immunity to Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or L major. Mechanistically, WASp was not required for Th2 programming but was required for Th2 effector function. WAS(-/-) CD4(+) T cells up-regulated IL-4 and GATA3 mRNA and secreted IL-4 protein during Th2 differentiation. In contrast, cytokine transcription was uncoupled from protein production in WAS(-/-) Th2-primed effectors. WAS(-/-) Th2s failed to produce IL-4 protein on restimulation despite elevated IL-4/GATA3 mRNA. Moreover, dominant-negative WASp expression in WT effector T cells blocked IL-4 production, but had no effect on IFNgamma. Thus WASp plays a selective, posttranscriptional role in Th2 effector function.",M1
20008191,"New insights into the biology of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS).The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked immunodeficiency disease with a characteristic clinical phenotype that includes thrombocytopenia with small platelets, eczema, recurrent infections due to immunodeficiency, and an increased incidence of autoimmune manifestations and malignancies. The identification of the molecular defect in the WAS gene has broadened the clinical spectrum of disease to include chronic or intermittent X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT), a relatively mild form of WAS, and X-linked neutropenia (XLN) due to an arrest of myelopoiesis. The pathophysiological mechanisms relate to defective actin polymerization in hematopoietic cells as a result of deficient or dysregulated activity of the WAS protein (<e>WASp</e>). The severity of disease is variable and somewhat predictable from genotype. Treatment strategies therefore range from conservative through to early definitive intervention by using allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and potentially somatic gene therapy. All aspects of the condition from clinical presentation to molecular pathology and basic cellular mechanisms have been reviewed recently.",M1
19962315,"The F-BAR protein Syp1 negatively regulates <e>WASp</e>-Arp2/3 complex activity during endocytic patch formation.BACKGROUND: Actin polymerization by Arp2/3 complex must be tightly regulated to promote clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Although many Arp2/3 complex activators have been identified, mechanisms for its negative regulation have remained more elusive. To address this, we analyzed the yeast arp2-7 allele, which is biochemically unique in causing unregulated actin assembly in vitro in the absence of Arp2/3 activators. RESULTS: We examined endocytosis in arp2-7 mutants by live-cell imaging of Sla1-GFP, a coat marker, and Abp1-RFP, which marks the later actin phase of endocytosis. Sla1-GFP and Abp1-RFP lifetimes were accelerated in arp2-7 mutants, which is opposite to actin nucleation-impaired arp2 alleles or deletions of Arp2/3 activators. We performed a screen for multicopy suppressors of arp2-7 and identified SYP1, an FCHO1 homolog, which contains F-BAR and AP-2micro homology domains. Overexpression of SYP1 in arp2-7 cells slowed Sla1-GFP lifetimes closer to wild-type cells. Further, purified Syp1 directly inhibited Las17/WASp stimulation of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly in vitro. This activity was mapped to a fragment of Syp1 located between its F-BAR and AP-2micro homology domains and depends on sequences in Las17/WASp outside of the VCA domain. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data identify Syp1 as a novel negative regulator of WASp-Arp2/3 complex that helps choreograph the precise timing of actin assembly during endocytosis.",M1
19934015,"Repression of <e>Wasp</e> by JAK/STAT signalling inhibits medial actomyosin network assembly and apical cell constriction in intercalating epithelial cells.Tissue morphogenesis requires stereotyped cell shape changes, such as apical cell constriction in the mesoderm and cell intercalation in the ventrolateral ectoderm of Drosophila. Both processes require force generation by an actomyosin network. The subcellular localization of Myosin-II (Myo-II) dictates these different morphogenetic processes. In the intercalating ectoderm Myo-II is mostly cortical, but in the mesoderm Myo-II is concentrated in a medial meshwork. We report that apical constriction is repressed by JAK/STAT signalling in the lateral ectoderm independently of Twist. Inactivation of the JAK/STAT pathway causes germband extension defects because of apical constriction ventrolaterally. This is associated with ectopic recruitment of Myo-II in a medial web, which causes apical cell constriction as shown by laser nanosurgery. Reducing Myo-II levels rescues the JAK/STAT mutant phenotype, whereas overexpression of the Myo-II heavy chain (also known as Zipper), or constitutive activation of its regulatory light chain, does not cause medial accumulation of Myo-II nor apical constriction. Thus, JAK/STAT controls Myo-II localization by additional mechanisms. We show that regulation of actin polymerization by Wasp, but not by Dia, is important in this process. Constitutive activation of Wasp, a branched actin regulator, causes apical cell constriction and promotes medial 'web' formation. Wasp is inactivated at the cell cortex in the germband by JAK/STAT signalling. Lastly, wasp mutants rescue the normal cortical enrichment of Myo-II and inhibit apical constriction in JAK/STAT mutants, indicating that Wasp is an effector of JAK/STAT signalling in the germband. We discuss possible models for the role of Wasp activity in the regulation of Myo-II distribution.",M1
19909249,"Functionally defining the endothelial transcriptome, from Robo4 to ECSCR.We have applied search algorithms to expression databases to identify genes whose expression is restricted to the endothelial cell. Such genes frequently play a critical role in endothelial biology and angiogenesis. Two such genes are the roundabout receptor Robo4 and the ECSCR (endothelial-cell-specific chemotaxis regulator). Endothelial cells express both Robo1 and Robo4, which we have knocked down using siRNA (small interfering RNA) and then studied the effect in a variety of in vitro assays. Both Robo4 and Robo1 knockdown inhibited in vitro tube formation on Matrigel. Transfection of Robo4 into endothelial cells increased the number of filopodial extensions from the cell, but failed to do so in Robo1-knockdown cells. Separate immunoprecipitation studies showed that Robo1 and Robo4 heterodimerize. We conclude from this and other work that a heteroduplex of Robo1 and Robo4 signals through <e>WASP</e> (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) and other actin nucleation-promoting factors to increase the number of filopodia and cell migration. Knockdown of the transmembrane ECSCR protein in endothelial cells also reduced chemotaxis and impaired tube formation on Matrigel. Yeast two-hybrid analysis and immunoprecipitation studies showed that, in contrast with the roundabouts, ECSCR binds to the actin-modulatory filamin A. We conclude that all three of these genes are critical for effective endothelial cell migration and, in turn, angiogenesis.",M1
19889090,"Dissecting the role of the Tir:Nck and Tir:IRTKS/IRSp53 signalling pathways in vivo.Attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions and actin polymerization, the hallmark of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium (CR) infections, are dependent on the effector Tir. Phosphorylation of Tir(EPEC/CR) Y474/1 leads to recruitment of Nck and neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-<e>WASP</e>) and strong actin polymerization in cultured cells. Tir(EPEC/CR) also contains an Asn-Pro-Tyr (NPY(454/1)) motif, which triggers weak actin polymerization. In EHEC the NPY(458) actin polymerization pathway is amplified by TccP/EspF(U), which is recruited to Tir via IRSp53 and/or insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS). Here we used C. rodentium to investigate the different Tir signalling pathways in vivo. Following infection with wild-type C. rodentium IRTKS, but not IRSp53, was recruited to the bacterial attachment sites. Similar results were seen after infection of human ileal explants with EHEC. Mutating Y471 or Y451 in Tir(CR) abolished recruitment of Nck and IRTKS respectively, but did not affect recruitment of N-WASP or A/E lesion formation. This suggests that despite their crucial role in actin polymerization in cultured cells the Tir:Nck and Tir:IRTKS pathways are not essential for N-WASP recruitment or A/E lesion formation in vivo. Importantly, wild-type C. rodentium out-competed the tir tyrosine mutants during mixed infections. These results uncouple the Tir:Nck and Tir:IRTKS pathways from A/E lesion formation in vivo but assign them an important in vivo role.",M1
19817875,"Characterization of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) mutants using Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is caused by alterations in the WAS protein (<e>WASP</e>), and 80% of the missense mutations are located in the WH1 domain, the region essential for interaction with the WASP-interacting protein (WIP). It has been suggested that loss of WASP-WIP interaction is causal to the disease. Las17p (yeast WASP) is essential for growth at 37 degrees C. The growth defect of the las17Delta strain can be suppressed by the expression of human WASP together with WIP. Using the las17Delta strain, we have analyzed 52 missense mutations in the gene encoding WASP and found that 13 of these mutant proteins were unable to suppress the growth defect of the las17Delta strain. The majority of these 13 mutations cause the classic WAS in humans and are located within the WH1 domain, while none of the 12 mutations outside the WH1 domain abolished the activity of WASP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. This suggests that some of the mutations (13 out of 40) in the WH1 domain cause the syndrome in humans by perturbing the WASP-WIP complex formation, while the rest of the mutations cause the syndrome without affecting the WASP-WIP complex formation, but may affect the activity of the complex.",M1
19808890,"Regulation of podosome dynamics by <e>WASp</e> phosphorylation: implication in matrix degradation and chemotaxis in macrophages.Podosomes, adhesion structures capable of matrix degradation, have been linked with the ability of cells to perform chemotaxis and invade tissues. Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp), an effector of the RhoGTPase Cdc42 and a Src family kinase substrate, regulates macrophage podosome formation. In this study, we demonstrate that WASp is active in podosomes by using TIRF-FRET microscopy. Pharmacological and RNA interference approaches suggested that continuous WASp activity is required for podosome formation and function. Rescue experiments using point mutations demonstrate an absolute requirement for Cdc42 binding to WASp in podosome formation. Although tyrosine phosphorylation was not absolutely required for podosome formation, phosphorylation did regulate the rate of podosome nucleation and actin filament stability. Importantly, WASp tyrosine phosphorylation does not alter WASp activation, instead phosphorylation appears to be important for the restriction of WASp activity to podosomes. In addition, the matrix-degrading ability of cells requires WASp phosphorylation. Chemotactic responses to CSF-1 were also attenuated in the absence of endogenous WASp, which could not be rescued with either tyrosine mutation. These results suggest a more complex role for tyrosine phosphorylation than simply in the regulation of WASp activity, and suggest a link between podosome dynamics and macrophage migration.",M1
19805221,"Phosphorylation of <e>WASp</e> is a key regulator of activity and stability in vivo.The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) is a key cytoskeletal regulator in hematopoietic cells. Covalent modification of a conserved tyrosine by phosphorylation has emerged as an important potential determinant of activity, although the physiological significance remains uncertain. In a murine knockin model, mutation resulting in inability to phosphorylate Y293 (Y293F) mimicked many features of complete WASp-deficiency. Although a phosphomimicking mutant Y293E conferred enhanced actin-polymerization, the cellular phenotype was similar due to functional dysregulation. Furthermore, steady-state levels of Y293E-WASp were markedly reduced compared to wild-type WASp and Y293F-WASp, although partially recoverable by treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors. Consequently, tyrosine phosphorylation plays a critical role in normal activation of WASp in vivo, and is indispensible for multiple tasks including proliferation, phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and assembly of adhesion structures. Furthermore, it may target WASp for proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby providing a default mechanism for self-limiting stimulation of the Arp2/3 complex.",M1
19741094,"Cdc42 regulates Fc gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis through the activation and phosphorylation of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASP</e>) and neural-WASP.Cdc42 is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton and activator of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP). Although several studies have separately demonstrated the requirement for both Cdc42 and WASP in Fc(gamma) receptor (Fc(gamma)R)-mediated phagocytosis, their precise roles in the signal cascade leading to engulfment are still unclear. Reduction of endogenous Cdc42 expression by using RNA-mediated interference (short hairpin RNA [shRNA]) severely impaired the phagocytic capacity of RAW/LR5 macrophages, due to defects in phagocytic cup formation, actin assembly, and pseudopod extension. Addition of wiskostatin, a WASP/neural-WASP (N-WASP) inhibitor showed extensive inhibition of phagocytosis, actin assembly, and cell extension identical to the phenotype seen upon reduction of Cdc42 expression. However, using WASP-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages or shRNA of WASP or N-WASP indicated a requirement for both WASP and N-WASP in phagocytosis. Cdc42 was necessary for WASP/N-WASP activation, as determined using a conformation-sensitive antibody against WASP/N-WASP and partial restoration of phagocytosis in Cdc42 reduced cells by expression of a constitutively activated WASP. In addition, Cdc42 was required for proper WASP tyrosine phosphorylation, which was also necessary for phagocytosis. These results indicate that Cdc42 is essential for the activation of WASP and N-WASP, leading to actin assembly and phagocytic cup formation by macrophages during Fc(gamma)R-mediated phagocytosis.",M1
19733207,"Antiplatelet antibodies in <e>WASP</e>(-) mice correlate with evidence of increased in vivo platelet consumption.OBJECTIVE: To study the role of antiplatelet antibodies in the thrombocytopenia of murine Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A flow cytometric method was developed for detection of serum antiplatelet antibodies via their binding to intact target platelets lacking surface antibodies. Platelets were labeled with 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) in order to track their clearance from the circulation. WASP(-)muMT(-/-) mice were generated by standard breeding methods. RESULTS: Serum antiplatelet antibodies were detected in approximately 40% of WASP(-) males. The mean level of reticulated platelets is significantly increased in these antibody(+) males. While WASP(-) males show an approximately 50% reduction in platelet counts, 5% to 10% show a more severe thrombocytopenia associated with increased reticulated platelets, suggesting the presence of clearance-inducing antiplatelet antibodies. In support of that inference, 90% of the latter mice show detectable serum antiplatelet antibodies. The antibodies are primarily immunoglobulin G, and are also detected in &gt;30% of CD47(-/-) males. WASP(-)muMT(-/-) males, which demonstrate no serum- or platelet-associated antibodies, show a degree of thrombocytopenia similar to that of WASP(-) males. Their platelet clearance rates remain accelerated--more so in WASP(-)muMT(-/-) than WASP(+)muMT(-/-) recipients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that platelet WASP deficiency results in an increase in platelet clearance rates by two mechanisms: an antibody-independent mechanism that largely requires WASP deficiency in trans, and an antibody-dependent mechanism that does not. Both an increased incidence of antiplatelet antibodies and an increased susceptibility to their effects contribute to antibody-dependent clearance of WASP(-) platelets.",M1
19716703,"Drosophila Cip4/Toca-1 integrates membrane trafficking and actin dynamics through <e>WASP</e> and SCAR/WAVE.BACKGROUND: Developmental processes are intimately tied to signaling events that integrate the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane dynamics. The F-BAR-domain-containing proteins are prime candidates to couple actin dynamics and membrane trafficking in different morphogenetic processes. RESULTS: Here, we present the functional analysis of the Drosophila F-BAR protein Cip4/Toca1 (Cdc42-interacting protein 4/transducer of Cdc42-dependent actin assembly 1). Cip4 is able to form a complex with WASP and SCAR/WAVE and recruits both actin-nucleation-promoting factors to invaginating membranes and endocytic vesicles. Actin-comet-tail-based movement of these vesicles depends not only on WASP but largely on WAVE function. In vivo, loss of cip4 function causes multiple wing hairs. A similar phenotype is observed when vesicle scission is affected after Dynamin suppression. Gene dosage experiments show that Cip4 and WAVE functionally interact to restrict wing hair formation. Further rescue experiments confirm that Cip4 is able to act through WAVE and WASP in vivo. Biochemical and functional data support a model in which Cdc42 acts upstream of Cip4 and recruits not only WASP but also SCAR/WAVE via Abi to control Dynamin-dependent cell polarization in the wing. CONCLUSION: Cip4 integrates membrane trafficking and actin dynamics through WASP and WAVE. First, Cip4 promotes membrane invaginations and triggers the vesicle scission by recruiting Dynamin to the neck of nascent vesicles. Second, Cip4 recruits WASP and WAVE proteins to induce actin polymerization, supporting vesicle scission and providing the force for vesicle movement.",M1
19692704,"Platelet-associated IgAs and impaired GPVI responses in platelets lacking WIP.The role of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASp</e>) in platelet function is unclear because platelets that lack WASp function normally. WASp constitutively associates with WASp-interacting protein (WIP) in resting and activated platelets. The role of WIP in platelet function was investigated using mice that lack WIP or WASp. WIP knockout (KO) platelets lack WASp and thus are double deficient. WIP KO mice have a thrombocytopenia, similar to WASp KO mice, resulting in part from enhanced platelet clearance. Most WIP KO, but not WASp KO, mice evolved platelet-associated immunoglobulins (Ig) of the IgA class, which normalize their platelet survival but diminish their glycoprotein VI (GPVI) responses. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation, including that of phospholipase C-gamma2, and calcium mobilization are impaired in IgA-presenting WIP KO platelets stimulated through GPVI, resulting in defects in alpha-granule secretion, integrin alphaIIbbeta3 activation, and actin assembly. The anti-GPVI antibody JAQ1 induces the irreversible loss of GPVI from circulating platelets in wild-type mice, but not in WIP KO mice that bear high levels of platelet-associated IgAs. Together, the data indicate that platelet-associated IgAs negatively modulate GPVI signaling and function in WIP KO mice.",M1
19654965,"Phenotypic and genotypic correction of <e>WASP</e> gene mutation in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome by unrelated cord blood stem cell transplantation.We present two cases of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), in which nonsense mutations in the WASP gene were corrected phenotypically as well as genotypically by unrelated cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBSCT). Two male patients were diagnosed with WAS at the age of 5-month and 3-month and each received unrelated CBSCT at 16-month and 20-month of age, respectively. The infused cord blood (CB) units had 4/6 and 5/6 HLA matches and the infusion doses of total nucleated cells (TNC) and CD34+ cells were 6.24x10(7)/kg and 5.08x10(7)/kg for TNC and 1.33x10(5)/kg and 4.8x10(5)/kg for CD34+ cells, for UPN1 and UPN2, respectively. Complete donor cell chimerism was documented by variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) with neutrophil engraftment on days 31 and 13 and platelets on days 58 and 50, respectively. Immunologic reconstitution demonstrated that CBSCT resulted in consistent and stable T-, B-, and NK-cell development. Flow cytometric analysis for immunologic markers and sequence analysis of the WASP gene mutation revealed a normal pattern after CBSCT. These cases demonstrate that CBs can be an important source of stem cells for the phenotypical and genotypical correction of genetic diseases such as WAS.",M1
19644501,"The SCAR and <e>WASp</e> nucleation-promoting factors act sequentially to mediate Drosophila myoblast fusion.The actin nucleation-promoting factors SCAR/WAVE and WASp, together with associated elements, mediate the formation of muscle fibres through myoblast fusion during Drosophila embryogenesis. Our phenotypic analysis, following the disruption of these two pathways, suggests that they function in a sequential manner. Suppressor of cyclic AMP receptor (SCAR) activity is required before the formation of pores in the membranes of fusing cells, whereas Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) promotes the expansion of nascent pores and completion of the fusion process. Genetic epistasis experiments are consistent with this step-wise temporal progression. Our observations further imply a separate, Rac-dependent role for the SCAR complex in promoting myoblast migration. In keeping with the sequential utilization of the two systems, we observe abnormal accumulations of filamentous actin at the fusion sites when both pathways are disrupted, resembling those present when only SCAR-complex function is impaired. This observation further suggests that actin-filament accumulation at the fusion sites might not depend on Arp2/3 activity altogether.",M1
19643989,"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein is an effector of Kit signaling.The pleiotropic receptor tyrosine kinase Kit can provide cytoskeletal signals that define cell shape, positioning, and migration, but the underlying mechanisms are less well understood. In this study, we provide evidence that Kit signals through Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASP</e>), the central hematopoietic actin nucleation-promoting factor and regulator of the cytoskeleton. Kit ligand (KL) stimulation resulted in transient tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP, as well as interacting proteins WASP-interacting protein and Arp2/3. KL-induced filopodia in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) were significantly decreased in number and size in the absence of WASP. KL-dependent regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels was aberrant in WASP-deficient BMMCs. When BMMCs were derived from WASP-heterozygous female mice using KL as a growth factor, the cultures eventually developed from a mixture of WASP-positive and -negative populations into a homogenous WASP-positive culture derived from the WASP-positive progenitors. Thus, WASP expression conferred a selective advantage to the development of Kit-dependent hematopoiesis consistent with the selective advantage of WASP-positive hematopoietic cells observed in WAS-heterozygous female humans. Finally, KL-mediated gene expression in wild-type and WASP-deficient BMMCs was compared and revealed that approximately 30% of all Kit-induced changes were WASP dependent. The results indicate that Kit signaling through WASP is necessary for normal Kit-mediated filopodia formation, cell survival, and gene expression, and provide new insight into the mechanism in which WASP exerts a strong selective pressure in hematopoiesis.",M1
19633175,"Wash functions downstream of Rho and links linear and branched actin nucleation factors.Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) family proteins are Arp2/3 activators that mediate the branched-actin network formation required for cytoskeletal remodeling, intracellular transport and cell locomotion. <e>Wasp</e> and Scar/WAVE, the two founding members of the family, are regulated by the GTPases Cdc42 and Rac, respectively. By contrast, linear actin nucleators, such as Spire and formins, are regulated by the GTPase Rho. We recently identified a third WAS family member, called Wash, with Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation activity. We show that Drosophila Wash interacts genetically with Arp2/3, and also functions downstream of Rho1 with Spire and the formin Cappuccino to control actin and microtubule dynamics during Drosophila oogenesis. Wash bundles and crosslinks F-actin and microtubules, is regulated by Rho1, Spire and Arp2/3, and is essential for actin cytoskeleton organization in the egg chamber. Our results establish Wash and Rho as regulators of both linear- and branched-actin networks, and suggest an Arp2/3-mediated mechanism for how cells might coordinately regulate these structures.",M1

19622753,"Intersectin-2L regulates caveola endocytosis secondary to Cdc42-mediated actin polymerization.Here we addressed the role of intersectin-2L (ITSN-2L), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho GTPase Cdc42, in the mechanism of caveola endocytosis in endothelial cells (ECs). Immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies showed that ITSN-2L associates with members of the Cdc42-<e>WASp</e>-Arp2/3 actin polymerization pathway. Expression of Dbl homology-pleckstrin homology (DH-PH) region of ITSN-2L (DH-PH(ITSN-2L)) induced specific activation of Cdc42, resulting in formation of extensive filopodia, enhanced cortical actin, as well as a shift from G-actin to F-actin. The  catalytically dead  DH-PH domain reversed these effects and induced significant stress fiber formation, without a detectable shift in actin pools. A biotin assay for caveola internalization indicated a significant decrease in the uptake of biotinylated proteins in DH-PH(ITSN-2L)-transfected cells compared with control and 1 microM jasplakinolide-treated cells. ECs depleted of ITSN-2L by small interfering RNA, however, showed decreased Cdc42 activation and actin remodeling similar to the defective DH-PH, resulting in 62% increase in caveola-mediated uptake compared with controls. Thus, ITSN-2L, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42, regulates different steps of caveola endocytosis in ECs by controlling the temporal and spatial actin polymerization and remodeling sub-adjacent to the plasma membrane.",M1
19589182,"The <e>WASP</e> and WAVE family proteins.All eukaryotic cells need to reorganize their actin cytoskeleton to change shape, divide, move, and take up nutrients for survival. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) family proteins are fundamental actin-cytoskeleton reorganizers found throughout the eukaryotes. The conserved function across species is to receive upstream signals from Rho-family small GTPases and send them to activate the Arp2/3 complex, leading to rapid actin polymerization, which is critical for cellular processes such as endocytosis and cell motility. Molecular and cell biological studies have identified a wide array of regulatory molecules that bind to the WASP and WAVE proteins and give them diversified roles in distinct cellular locations. Genetic studies using model organisms have also improved our understanding of how the WASP- and WAVE-family proteins act to shape complex tissue architectures. Current efforts are focusing on integrating these pieces of molecular information to draw a unified picture of how the actin cytoskeleton in a single cell works dynamically to build multicellular organization.",M1
19561083,"The mechanism of CSF-1-induced Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein activation in vivo: a role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Cdc42.A role for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASP</e>) in chemotaxis to various agents has been demonstrated in monocyte-derived cell types. Although WASP has been shown to be activated by multiple mechanisms in vitro, it is unclear how WASP is regulated in vivo. A WASP biosensor (WASPbs), which uses intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer to report WASP activation in vivo, was constructed, and following transfection of macrophages, activation of WASPbs upon treatment with colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) was detected globally as early as 30 s and remained localized to protrusive regions at later time points. Similar results were obtained when endogenous WASP activation was determined using conformation-sensitive antibodies. In vivo CSF-1-induced WASP activation was fully Cdc42-dependent. Activation of WASP in response to treatment with CSF-1 was also shown to be phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent. However, treatment with the Src family kinase inhibitors PP2 or SU6656 or disruption of the major tyrosine phosphorylation site of WASPbs (Y291F mutation) did not reduce the level of CSF-1-induced WASP activation. Our results indicate that WASP activation downstream of CSF-1R is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- and Cdc42-dependent consistent with an involvement of these molecules in macrophage migration. However, although tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP has been proposed to stimulate WASP activity, we found no evidence to indicate that this occurs in vivo.",M1
19543274,"The Arp2/3 complex and <e>WASp</e> are required for apical trafficking of Delta into microvilli during cell fate specification of sensory organ precursors.Cell fate decisions mediated by the Notch signalling pathway require direct cell-cell contact between adjacent cells. In Drosophila melanogaster, an external sensory organ (ESO) develops from a single sensory organ precursor (SOP) and its fate specification is governed by differential Notch activation. Here we show that mutations in actin-related protein-3 (Arp3) compromise Notch signalling, leading to a fate transformation of the ESO. Our data reveal that during ESO fate specification, most endocytosed vesicles containing the ligand Delta traffic to a prominent apical actin-rich structure (ARS) formed in the SOP daughter cells. Using immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses, we show that the ARS contains numerous microvilli on the apical surface of SOP progeny. In Arp2/3 and WASp mutants, the surface area of the ARS is substantially reduced and there are significantly fewer microvilli. More importantly, trafficking of Delta-positive vesicles from the basal area to the apical portion of the ARS is severely compromised. Our data indicate that WASp-dependent Arp2/3 actin polymerization is crucial for apical presentation of Delta, providing a mechanistic link between actin polymerization and Notch signalling.",M1
19494259,"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein is required for homeostasis and function of invariant NKT cells.NKT cells comprise a separate T lineage expressing semi-invariant T cell receptors. Canonical invariant NKT (iNKT) cells specifically recognize lipid Ags presented by CD1d, a MHC class I-like molecule. iNKT cells function, in part, as initial responders to bacterial infection and play a role in immune surveillance and tumor rejection. The Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (<e>WASp</e>) serves as a crucial link between cellular stimuli and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Although we and others have identified a key role for WASp in homeostasis of T-regulatory and marginal zone B cells, little data exist regarding the role for WASp within the iNKT lineage. Analysis of WASp-expressing cell populations in heterozygous female WASp mice revealed a substantial selective advantage for WASp(+) vs WASp(-) iNKT cells. Although adult WASp-deficient (WASp(-/-)) mice had normal thymic and bone marrow iNKT numbers, we observed 2- to 3-fold reduction in the numbers of iNKT cells in the spleen and liver. This peripheral iNKT deficit is manifested, in part, due to defective iNKT homeostasis. WASp(-/-) iNKT cells exhibited reduced levels of integrin surface expression and decreased homing and/or retention within peripheral tissues in a competitive repopulation model. In addition, analysis of young mice showed that WASp is important for both maturation and egress of thymic iNKT cells. WASp(-/-) iNKT cells also exhibited a marked reduction in Ag-induced proliferation and cytokine production. Our findings highlight the crucial role for WASp in iNKT development, homeostasis, and activation, and identify iNKT dysfunction as an additional factor likely to contribute to the clinical features observed in WAS patients.",M1
19487689,"Sorting nexin 33 induces mammalian cell micronucleated phenotype and actin polymerization by interacting with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein.Sorting nexin 33 (SNX33) is a novel member of the sorting nexin superfamily with three predicted structural domains, SH3-PX-BAR. Very little is known about the cellular function of SNX33. In an effort to analyze its structure/function relationship, we attempted but failed to generate stable cell lines for short hairpin RNA or overexpression SNX33. Transient knockdown of SNX33 induces both HeLa and MCF7 cells to grow multiple long processes, delay the G(1)/M transition, and become more apoptotic, implying that SNX33 may control cell cycle process through influence the cytoskeleton. In vitro cell lineage analysis revealed that cells transfected with SNX33 failed to divide and became micronucleated, suggesting a specific defect in cytokinesis. Further analysis revealed that SNX33 induced the accumulation of actin at the perinuclear space, which might have disabled the cytokinetic machinery. However, SNX33 appears to mediate actin polymerization indirectly, as they do not interact with each other. SNX33 interacts with itself and SNX9. Interestingly, it also interacts with VCA domain of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASp</e>), a protein known to be involved in actin polymerization. Indeed, cells overexpressing WASp failed to divide and form stable colonies as SNX33, consistent with the notion that SNX33 may interfere with cytokinesis. On the other hand, knockdown of WASp alleviates the phenotype induced by SNX33. Taken together, our results suggest that SNX33 plays a role in maintaining cell shape and cell cycle progression through its interaction with WASp.",M1
19409937,"Regulation of the formation and trafficking of vesicles from Golgi by PCH family proteins during chemotaxis.Previous study demonstrated that <e>WASP</e> localizes on vesicles during Dictyostelium chemotaxis and these vesicles appear to be preferentially distributed at the leading and trailing edge of migrating cells. In this study, we have examined the role of PCH family proteins, Nwk/Bzz1p-like protein (NLP) and Syndapin-like protein (SLP), in the regulation of the formation and trafficking of WASP-vesicles during chemotaxis. NLP and SLP appear to be functionally redundant and deletion of both nlp and slp genes causes the loss of polarized F-actin organization and significant defects in chemotaxis. WASP and NLP are colocalized on vesicles and interactions between two molecules via the SH3 domain of NLP/SLP and the proline-rich repeats of WASP are required for vesicle formation from Golgi. Microtubules are required for polarized trafficking of these vesicles as vesicles showing high directed mobility are absent in cells treated with nocodazole. Our results suggest that interaction of WASP with NLP/SLP is required for the formation and trafficking of vesicles from Golgi to the membrane, which might play a central role in the establishment of cell polarity during chemotaxis.",M1

They all contain Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASP</e>) homology 2 (WH2 or W) domains for actin nucleation but seem to employ different molecular mechanisms and serve distinct cellular functions. Here, we summarize what is currently known about the different molecular mechanisms that Spire, Cordon-Bleu and Leiomodin seem to use and, also, the bacterial counterparts that mimic them (VopF, VopL and TARP). Recent studies on these WH2 proteins offer unique insight into the biological problem of actin-filament formation and how cells use specialized molecular machines to bring about so many different cytoskeletal structures.",M1
19359486,"WIP is critical for T cell responsiveness to IL-2.The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) interacting protein (WIP) stabilizes the WAS protein (<e>WASP</e>), the product of the gene mutated in WAS. WIP-deficient T cells have low WASP levels, limiting the usefulness of WIP KO mice in defining the role of WIP in T cell function. To define this role, we compared WIP/WASP double KO (DKO) mice to WASP KO mice on DO11.10 background. T cell development was normal in both strains, but peripheral T cell numbers were significantly decreased in DKO mice. WASP KO T cells proliferated and secreted IL-2 normally in response to OVA peptide (OVAp). In contrast, T cells from DKO mice proliferated poorly in response to OVAp in vitro, and cutaneous hapten hypersensitivity was deficient in these mice. DKO T cells up-regulated CD25 expression and secreted normal amounts of IL-2 after antigen stimulation, but had defective response to IL-2, evidenced by failure to further up-regulate CD25 expression, phosphorylate STAT5, and induce expression of STAT5-dependent genes. DKO, but not WASP KO, T cells had a disrupted subcortical actin cytoskeleton and impaired actin polymerization after T cell antigen receptor (TCR) ligation. These results indicate that WIP is essential for IL-2 signaling and responsiveness in T cells, possibly because of its critical role in TCR-triggered actin cytoskeletal reorganization.",M1
19351959,"Recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a severe X-linked immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the gene encoding for <e>WASP</e>, a key regulator of signaling and cytoskeletal reorganization in hematopoietic cells. Mutations in WASP result in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from the relatively mild X-linked thrombocytopenia to the classic full-blown WAS phenotype characterized by thrombocytopenia, immunodeficiency, eczema, and high susceptibility to developing tumors and autoimmune manifestations. The life expectancy of patients affected by severe WAS is reduced, unless they are successfully cured by bone marrow transplantation from related identical or matched unrelated donors. Because many patients lack a compatible bone marrow donor, the administration of WAS gene-corrected autologous hematopoietic stem cells could represent an alternative therapeutic approach. In the present review, we focus on recent progress in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to the pathophysiology of WAS. Although molecular and cellular studies have extensively analyzed the mechanisms leading to defects in T, B, and dendritic cells, the basis of autoimmunity and thrombocytopenia still remains poorly understood. A full understanding of these mechanisms is still needed to further implement new therapeutic strategies for this peculiar immunodeficiency.",M1
19350555,"Activation of Src kinase by protein-tyrosine phosphatase-PEST in osteoclasts: comparative analysis of the effects of bisphosphonate and protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor on Src activation in vitro.PTP-PEST is involved in the regulation of sealing ring formation in osteoclasts. In this article, we have shown a regulatory role for PTP-PEST on dephosphorylation of c-Src at Y527 and phosphorylation at Y418 in the catalytic site. Activation of Src in osteoclasts by over-expression of PTP-PEST resulted in the phosphorylation of cortactin at Y421 and <e>WASP</e> at Y294. Also enhanced as a result, is the interaction of Src, cortactin, and Arp2 with WASP. Moreover, the number of osteoclasts displaying sealing ring and bone resorbing activity was increased in response to PTP-PEST over-expression as compared with control osteoclasts. Cells expressing constitutively active-Src (527YDeltaF) simulate the effects mediated by PTP-PEST. Treatment of osteoclasts with a bisphosphonate alendronate or a potent PTP inhibitor PAO decreased the activity and phosphorylation of Src at Y418 due to reduced dephosphorylation state at Y527. Therefore, Src-mediated phosphorylation of cortactin and WASP as well as the formation of WASP.cortactin.Arp2 complex and sealing ring were reduced in these osteoclasts. Similar effects were observed in osteoclasts treated with an Src inhibitor PP2. We have shown that bisphosphonates could modulate the function of osteoclasts by inhibiting downstream signaling mediated by PTP-PEST/Src, in addition to its effect on the inhibition of the post-translational modification of small GTP-binding proteins such as Rab, Rho, and Rac as shown by others. The promising effects of the inhibitors PP2 and PAO on osteoclast function suggest a therapeutic approach for patients with bone metastases and osteoporosis as an alternative to bisphosphonates.",M1
19302579,"A translocated protein of Bartonella henselae interferes with endocytic uptake of individual bacteria and triggers uptake of large bacterial aggregates via the invasome.Bartonella henselae enters human endothelial cells (ECs) by two alternative routes: either by endocytosis, giving rise to Bartonella-containing vacuoles or by invasome-mediated internalization. Only the latter process depends on the type IV secretion system VirB/VirD4 and involves the formation of cell surface-associated bacterial aggregates, which get engulfed by EC membranes in an F-actin-dependent manner, eventually resulting in their complete internalization. Here, we report that among the VirB/VirD4-translocated effector proteins BepA-BepG only BepG is required for triggering invasome-mediated internalization. Expression of BepG in the Bep-deficient DeltabepA-G mutant restored invasome-mediated internalization. Likewise, ectopic expression of BepG in ECs also restored invasome-mediated internalization of the DeltabepA-G mutant, while no discernable cytoskeletal rearrangements were triggered in uninfected cells. Rather, BepG inhibited endocytic uptake of B. henselae into Bartonella-containing vacuoles and other endocytic processes, that is, invasin-mediated uptake of Yersinia enterocolitica and uptake of inert microspheres. BepG thus triggers invasome-mediated internalization primarily by inhibiting bacterial endocytosis. Bacteria accumulating on the cell surface then induce locally the F-actin rearrangements characteristic for the invasome. These cytoskeletal changes encompass both the rearrangement of pre-existing F-actin fibres and the de novo polymerization of cortical F-actin in the periphery of the invasome by Rac1/Scar1/WAVE- and Cdc42/<e>WASP</e>-dependent pathways that involve the recruitment of the Arp2/3 complex.",M1
19298826,"Nucleotide- and activator-dependent structural and dynamic changes of arp2/3 complex monitored by hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry.Arp2/3 complex plays a central role in the de novo nucleation of filamentous actin as branches on existing filaments. The complex must bind ATP, protein activators [e.g., Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASp</e>)], and the side of an actin filament to form a new actin filament. Amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry was used to examine the structural and dynamic properties of the mammalian Arp2/3 complex in the presence of both ATP and the activating peptide segment from WASp. Changes in the rate of hydrogen exchange indicate that ATP binding causes conformational rearrangements of Arp2 and Arp3 that are transmitted allosterically to the Arp complex (ARPC)1, ARPC2, ARPC4, and ARPC5 subunits. These data are consistent with the closure of nucleotide-binding cleft of Arp3 upon ATP binding, resulting in structural rearrangements that propagate throughout the complex. Binding of the VCA domain of WASp to ATP-Arp2/3 further modulates the rates of hydrogen exchange in these subunits, indicating that a global conformational reorganization is occurring. These effects may include the direct binding of activators to Arp3, Arp2, and ARPC1; alterations in the relative orientations of Arp2 and Arp3; and the long-range transmission of activator-dependent signals to segments proposed to be involved in binding the F-actin mother filament.",M1
19293156,"Determination of in vivo dissociation constant, KD, of Cdc42-effector complexes in live mammalian cells using single wavelength fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy.The RhoGTPase Cdc42 coordinates cell morphogenesis, cell cycle, and cell polarity decisions downstream of membrane-bound receptors through distinct effector pathways. Cdc42-effector protein interactions represent important elements of cell signaling pathways that regulate cell biology in systems as diverse as yeast and humans. To derive mechanistic insights into cell signaling pathways, it is vital that we generate quantitative data from in vivo systems. We need to be able to measure parameters such as protein concentrations, rates of diffusion, and dissociation constants (K(D)) of protein-protein interactions in vivo. Here we show how single wavelength fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy in combination with Förster resonance energy transfer analysis can be used to determine K(D) of Cdc42-effector interactions in live mammalian cells. Constructs encoding green fluorescent protein or monomeric red fluorescent protein fusion proteins of Cdc42, an effector domain (CRIB), and two effectors, neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-<e>WASP</e>) and insulin receptor substrate protein (IRSp53), were expressed as pairs in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and concentrations of free protein as well as complexed protein were determined. The measured K(D) for Cdc42V12-N-WASP, Cdc42V12-CRIB, and Cdc42V12-IRSp53 was 27, 250, and 391 nm, respectively. The determination of K(D) for Cdc42-effector interactions opens the way to describe cell signaling pathways quantitatively in vivo in mammalian cells.",M1
19272406,"Las17p-Vrp1p but not Las17p-Arp2/3 interaction is important for actin patch polarization in yeast.The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in many important cellular processes such as cell polarization, cell division and endocytosis. The dynamic changes to the actin cytoskeleton that accompany these processes are regulated by actin-associated proteins Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (<e>WASP</e>) (known as Las17p in yeast) and WASP-Interacting Protein (WIP) (known as Vrp1p in yeast). Both yeast and human WASP bind to and stimulate the Arp2/3 complex which in turn nucleates assembly of actin monomers into filaments at polarized sites at the cortex. WASP-WIP interaction in yeast and humans are important for Arp2/3 complex stimulation in vitro. It has been proposed that these interactions are also important for polarized actin assembly in vivo. However, the redundancy of actin-associated proteins has made it difficult to test this hypothesis. We have identified two point mutations (L80T and H94L) in yeast WASP that in combination abolish WASP-WIP interaction in yeast. We also identify an N-terminal fragment of Las17p (N-Las17p1-368) able to interact with Vrp1p but not Arp2/3. Using these mutant and truncated forms of yeast WASP we provide novel evidence that WASP interaction with WIP is more important than interaction with Arp2/3 for polarized actin assembly and endocytosis in yeast.",M1
19265163,"The mDial formin is required for neutrophil polarization, migration, and activation of the LARG/RhoA/ROCK signaling axis during chemotaxis.Neutrophil chemotaxis depends on actin dynamics, but the roles for specific cytoskeleton regulators in this response remain unclear. By analysis of mammalian diaphanous-related formin 1 (mDia1)-deficient mice, we have identified an essential role for this actin nucleator in neutrophil chemotaxis. Lack of mDia1 was associated with defects in chemoattractant-induced neutrophil actin polymerization, polarization, and directional migration, and also with impaired activation of RhoA, its downstream target p160-Rho-associated coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK), and the leukemia-associated RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG). Our data also revealed mDia1 to be associated with another cytoskeletal regulator, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASp</e>), at the leading edge of chemotaxing neutrophils and revealed polarized morphology and chemotaxis to be more mildly impaired in WAS(-/-) than in mDia1(-/-) neutrophils, but essentially abrogated by combined mDia1/WASp deficiency. Thus, mDia1 roles in neutrophil chemotaxis appear to be subserved in concert with WASp and are realized at least in part by activation of the LARG/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.",M1

Gene therapy could represent a therapeutic option for patients lacking a suitable bone marrow (BM) donor. In this study, we analyzed the long-term outcome of WAS gene therapy mediated by a clinically compatible lentiviral vector (LV) in a large cohort of was(null) mice. We demonstrated stable and full donor engraftment and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (<e>WASP</e>) expression in various hematopoietic lineages, up to 12 months after gene therapy. Importantly, we observed a selective advantage for T and B lymphocytes expressing transgenic WASP. T-cell receptor (TCR)-driven T-cell activation, as well as B-cell's ability to migrate in response to CXCL13, was fully restored. Safety was evaluated throughout the long-term follow-up of primary and secondary recipients of WAS gene therapy. WAS gene therapy did not affect the lifespan of treated animals. Both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tumors arose, but we excluded the association with gene therapy in all cases. Demonstration of long-term efficacy and safety of WAS gene therapy mediated by a clinically applicable LV is a key step toward the implementation of a gene therapy clinical trial for WAS.",M1
19234535,"Src kinase Hck association with the <e>WASp</e> and mDia1 cytoskeletal regulators promotes chemoattractant-induced Hck membrane targeting and activation in neutrophils.The haemopoietic cell kinase (Hck) plays an important but poorly understood role in coupling chemoattractant stimuli to the actin cytoskeletal rearrangement required for neutrophil polarization and chemotaxis. Here, we show that Hck coimmunoprecipitates with the cytoskeletal regulatory Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) and mammalian diaphanous-related formin 1 (mDia1) in chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophils, and that the 3 proteins inducibly colocalize with one another at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells. Hck interaction with WASp was found to be mediated by the Hck SH3 domain binding to the WASp proline-rich region, while Hck interaction with mDia1 was indirect but was required for binding to WASp. In contrast to wild-type cells, both WASp- and mDia1-deficient neutrophils showed severe impairment of chemokine-induced Hck membrane translocation and induction of Hck binding to WASp, and Hck activation and WASp tyrosine phosphorylation were impaired in mDia1-/- cells. Thus, chemotactic stimulation appears to induce an mDia1/Hck/WASp complex required for Hck membrane targeting and for induction of the Hck-mediated WASp tyrosine phosphorylation thought to be required for WASp-driven actin polymerization. These findings reveal that Hck functions in neutrophils to be realized, at least in part, via its interaction with mDia1 and WASp, and identifies the mDia1/Hck/WASp axis as a cytoskeletal signaling interface linking tyrosine phosphorylation to chemotactic and, possibly, other actin-based neutrophil responses.",M1
19147084,"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: diagnosis, clinical and laboratory manifestations, and treatment.Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked immunodeficiency disorder that has a variable clinical phenotype that correlates with the type of mutation in <e>WASP</e>, the gene encoding the WAS protein (WASP). WASP is a key regulator of actin polymerization in hematopoietic cells and has well-defined domains that are involved in signaling, cell locomotion, and immune synapse formation. Classic WAS often results from mutations that cause the absence of WASP expression, associated with thrombocytopenia with small platelets, sinopulmonary infections, and eczema in young males. Other phenotypes associated with expression of mutated WASP are X-linked thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. To date, the only curative therapy for WAS is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) although gene therapy for WAS is under study. At least 2 retrospective studies of HCT for WAS have indicated that although HLA-matched sibling donors have the best outcomes (81% to 88%), when such a donor is not available, a matched unrelated donor should be considered (71% event free survival), although results are best in patients age &lt; 5 years. Whereas most of the experience to date in Asia, Europe, and North America has been with myeloablative conditioning regimens, more recently, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens also have been used with success. The issue of whether mixed chimerism post-HCT (which has a higher incidence in RIC transplantation) is associated with increased autoimmune manifestations in patients with WAS remains to be resolved.",M1
19158382,"The <e>WASP</e> homologue Las17 activates the novel actin-regulatory activity of Ysc84 to promote endocytosis in yeast.Actin plays an essential role in many eukaryotic cellular processes, including motility, generation of polarity, and membrane trafficking. Actin function in these roles is regulated by association with proteins that affect its polymerization state, dynamics, and organization. Numerous proteins have been shown to localize with cortical patches of yeast actin during endocytosis, but the role of many of these proteins remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that the yeast protein Ysc84 represents a new class of actin-binding proteins, conserved from yeast to humans. It contains a novel N-terminal actin-binding domain termed Ysc84 actin binding (YAB), which can bind and bundle actin filaments. Intriguingly, full-length Ysc84 alone does not bind to actin, but binding can be activated by a specific motif within the polyproline region of the yeast WASP homologue Las17. We also identify a new monomeric actin-binding site on Las17. Together, the polyproline region of Las17 and Ysc84 can promote actin polymerization. Using live cell imaging, kinetics of assembly and disassembly of proteins at the endocytic site were analyzed and reveal that loss of Ysc84 and its homologue Lsb3 decrease inward movement of vesicles consistent with a role in actin polymerization during endocytosis.",M1
19155218,"FBP17 Mediates a Common Molecular Step in the Formation of Podosomes and Phagocytic Cups in Macrophages.Macrophages act to protect the body against inflammation and infection by engaging in chemotaxis and phagocytosis. In chemotaxis, macrophages use an actin-based membrane structure, the podosome, to migrate to inflamed tissues. In phagocytosis, macrophages form another type of actin-based membrane structure, the phagocytic cup, to ingest foreign materials such as bacteria. The formation of these membrane structures is severely affected in macrophages from patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), an X chromosome-linked immunodeficiency disorder. WAS patients lack WAS protein (<e>WASP</e>), suggesting that WASP is required for the formation of podosomes and phagocytic cups. Here we have demonstrated that formin-binding protein 17 (FBP17) recruits WASP, WASP-interacting protein (WIP), and dynamin-2 to the plasma membrane and that this recruitment is necessary for the formation of podosomes and phagocytic cups. The N-terminal EFC (extended FER-CIP4 homology)/F-BAR (FER-CIP4 homology and Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs) domain of FBP17 was previously shown to have membrane binding and deformation activities. Our results suggest that FBP17 facilitates membrane deformation and actin polymerization to occur simultaneously at the same membrane sites, which mediates a common molecular step in the formation of podosomes and phagocytic cups. These results provide a potential mechanism underlying the recurrent infections in WAS patients.",M1
19148537,"<e>WASP</e> and WAVE proteins: vital intrinsic regulators of cell motility and their role in cancer (review).Cell migration is critical during the metastatic spread of cancer cells. Metastases, rather than primary tumours, are responsible for most cancer-related deaths. Invasive cancer cells acquire a migratory phenotype which is associated with an increased expression of several genes involved in cell motility. Actin, which is the most abundant protein in most eukaryotic cells, is necessary for whole cell locomotion. Reorganisation of actin filaments is regulated by a highly integrated signalling cascade governed by 'molecular switches' which belong to the Rho GTPase family. WASP family proteins are downstream molecules which form a link between the GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton. The WASP family includes 5 members and is structurally divided into 2 groups: Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome proteins (WASPs) and WASP verprolin homologous proteins (WAVEs). Current evidence suggests that WAVEs are crucial for cell motility and metastasis. This is a review on the possible role of WAVEs in cancer and the clinical associations found in human cancer.",M1
19094983,"Cytoplasmic expression and specific binding of the VH/VL single domain intrabodies in transfected NIH3T3 cells.Intracellularly expressed antibody fragments (intrabodies) have been utilized as powerful tools not only for clinical applications but also for the functional analysis of proteins inside the cell. Among several types of intrabodies developed so far, single domain types composed of only the variable regions (V(H) or V(L)) of antibodies are the smallest and thus the easiest to design. In this study, four types of single domain intrabodies were evaluated against a cytosolic protein, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASP</e>), in gene-transfected NIH3T3 cells. These single domains were composed of the V(H) and V(L) region with or without their leader sequences. Although these single domains were expressed at similar levels in NIH3T3 cells, the binding activity to the cytosolic target was higher in the single domain constructs with leader sequences. These results suggest the usefulness of the single domain intrabody constructs to analyze the functional domains of cytosolic proteins in cells.",M1
19082760,"Mutations of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein affect protein expression and dictate the clinical phenotypes.Mutations of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (<e>WASP</e>) are responsible for classic Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT), and in rare instances congenital X-linked neutropenia (XLN). WASP is a regulator of actin polymerization in hematopoietic cells with well-defined functional domains that are involved in cell signaling and cell locomotion, immune synapse formation, and apoptosis. Mutations of WASP are located throughout the gene and either inhibit or disregulate normal WASP function. Analysis of a large patient population demonstrates a strong phenotype-genotype correlation. Classic WAS occurs when WASP is absent, XLT when mutated WASP is expressed and XLN when missense mutations occur in the Cdc42-binding site. However, because there are exceptions to this rule it is difficult to predict the long-term prognosis of a given affected boy solely based on the analysis of WASP expression.",M1
19018864,"Possible application of flow cytometry for evaluation of the structure and functional status of <e>WASP</e> in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), which is defective in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients, is an intracellular protein expressed in non-erythroid hematopoietic cells. Previously, we have established methods to detect intracellular WASP expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) using flow cytometric analysis (FCM-WASP) and have revealed that WAS patients showed absent or very low level intracellular WASP expression in lymphocytes and monocytes, while a significant amount of WASP was detected in those of normal individuals. We applied these methods for diagnostic screening of WAS patients and WAS carriers, as well as to the evaluation of mixed chimera in WAS patients who had previously undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. During these procedures, we have noticed that lymphocytes from normal control individuals showed dual positive peaks, while their monocytes invariably showed a single sharp WASP-positive peak. To investigate the basis of the dual positive peaks (WASP(low-bright) and WASP(high-bright)), we characterized the constituent linage lymphocytes of these two WASP-positive populations. As a result, we found each WASP(low/high) population comprised different linage PBMNCs. Furthermore, we propose that the difference between the two WASP-positive peaks did not result from any difference in WASP expression in the cells, but rather from a difference in the structural and functional status of the WASP protein in the cells. It has been shown that WASP may exist in two forms; an activated or inactivated form. Thus, the structural and functional WASP status or configuration could be evaluated by flow cytometric analysis.",M1
19018480,"Recent advances in the biology of <e>WASP</e> and WIP.WASP, the product of the gene mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, is expressed only in hematopoietic cells and is the archetype of a family of proteins that include N-WASP and Scar/WAVE. WASP plays a critical role in T cell activation and actin reorganization. WASP has multiple protein-interacting domains. Through its N-terminal EVH1 domain WASP binds to its partner WASP interacting protein (WIP) and through its C-terminal end it interacts with and activates the Arp2/3 complex. In lymphocytes, most of WASP is sequestered with WIP and binding to WIP is essential for the stability of WASP. The central proline-rich region of WASP serves as docking site to several adaptor proteins. Through these multiple interactions WASP integrates many cellular signals to actin cytoskeleton remodeling. In this review, we have summarized recent developments in the biology of WASP and the role of WIP in regulating WASP function. We also discuss WASP-independent functions of WIP.",M1

It was originally described in a three-generation family with five affected members that had an L270P mutation in the GTP-ase binding domain (GBD) of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASP</e>) [Devriendt et al (2001) Nature Genetics, Vol. 27, 313-317]. Here, we report and describe a large three-generation family with XLN, with 10 affected males and eight female carriers. A c.882T&gt;C mutation was identified in the WAS gene, resulting in an I294T mutation. The infectious course is variable and mild in view of the profound neutropenia. In addition to the original description, low-normal IgA levels, low to low-normal platelet counts and reduced natural killer (NK)-cell counts also appear as consistent XLN features. However, inverted CD4/CD8 ratios were not found in this family, nor were cases identified with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia. Female carriers exhibited a variable attenuated phenotype. Like L270P WASP, I294T WASP is constitutively active towards actin polymerization. In conclusion, this largest XLN kindred identified to date provides new independent genetic evidence that mutations disrupting the auto-inhibitory GBD of WASP are the cause of XLN. Reduced NK cells, low to low normal platelet counts and low to low-normal IgA levels are also features of XLN.",M1
18995840,"Hierarchical regulation of <e>WASP</e>/WAVE proteins.Members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family control actin dynamics in eukaryotic cells by stimulating the actin nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex. The prevailing paradigm for WASP regulation invokes allosteric relief of autoinhibition by diverse upstream activators. Here we demonstrate an additional level of regulation that is superimposed upon allostery: dimerization increases the affinity of active WASP species for Arp2/3 complex by up to 180-fold, greatly enhancing actin assembly by this system. This finding explains a large and apparently disparate set of observations under a common mechanistic framework. These include WASP activation by the bacterial effector EspFu and a large number of SH3 domain proteins, the effects on WASP of membrane localization/clustering and assembly into large complexes, and cooperativity between different family members. Allostery and dimerization act in hierarchical fashion, enabling WASP/WAVE proteins to integrate different classes of inputs to produce a wide range of cellular actin responses.",M1

18976918,"Cdc42, Par6, and aPKC regulate Arp2/3-mediated endocytosis to control local adherens junction stability.BACKGROUND: By acting as a dynamic link between adjacent cells in a monolayer, adherens junctions (AJs) maintain the integrity of epithelial tissues while allowing for neighbor exchange. Although it is not currently understood how this combination of AJ stability and plasticity is achieved, junctionally associated actin filaments are likely to play a role, because actin-based structures have been implicated in AJ organization and in the regulation of junctional turnover. RESULTS: Here, through exploring the role of actin cytoskeletal regulators in the developing Drosophila notum, we have identified a critical role for Cdc42-aPKC-Par6 in the maintenance of AJ organization. In this system, the loss or inhibition of Cdc42-aPKC-Par6 leads to junctional discontinuities, the formation of ectopic junctional structures, and defects in apical actin cytoskeletal organization. Affected cells also undergo progressive apical constriction and, frequently, delamination. Surprisingly, this Cdc42-aPKC-Par6-dependent regulation of junctional stability was found to be independent of several well-known targets of Cdc42-aPKC-Par6: Baz, Lgl, Rac, and SCAR. However, similar AJ defects are observed in <e>wasp</e>, arp2/3, and dynamin mutant cells, suggesting a requirement for actin-mediated endocytosis in the maintenance of junctional stability downstream of Cdc42. This was confirmed in endocytosis assays, which revealed a requirement for Cdc42, Arp2/3, and Dynamin for normal rates of E-cadherin internalization. CONCLUSIONS: By focusing on the molecular mechanisms required to maintain an epithelium, this analysis reveals a novel role for the epithelial polarity machinery, Cdc42-Par6-aPKC, in local AJ remodeling through the control of Arp2/3-dependent endocytosis.",M1
18976911,"Drosophila Cip4 and <e>WASp</e> define a branch of the Cdc42-Par6-aPKC pathway regulating E-cadherin endocytosis.BACKGROUND: Integral to the function and morphology of the epithelium is the lattice of cell-cell junctions known as adherens junctions (AJs). AJ stability and plasticity relies on E-Cadherin exocytosis and endocytosis. A mechanism regulating E-Cadherin (E-Cad) exocytosis to the AJs has implicated proteins of the exocyst complex, but mechanisms regulating E-Cad endocytosis from the AJs remain less well understood. RESULTS: Here we show that Cdc42, Par6, or aPKC loss of function is accompanied by the accumulation of apical E-Cad intracellular punctate structures and the disruption of AJs in Drosophila epithelial cells. These punctate structures derive from large and malformed endocytic vesicles that emanate from the AJs; a phenotype that is also observed upon blocking vesicle scission in dynamin mutant cells. We demonstrate that the Drosophila Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (Cip4) is a Cdc42 effector that interacts with Dynamin and the Arp2/3 activator WASp in Drosophila. Accordingly, Cip4, WASp, or Arp2/3 loss of function also results in defective E-Cadherin endocytosis. CONCLUSION: Altogether our results show that Cdc42 functions with Par6 and aPKC to regulate E-Cad endocytosis and define Cip4 and WASp as regulators of the early E-Cad endocytic events in epithelial tissue.",M1
18948384,"Active involvement of Robo1 and Robo4 in filopodia formation and endothelial cell motility mediated via <e>WASP</e> and other actin nucleation-promoting factors.This study aimed to further elucidate the function of Roundabout proteins in endothelium. We show that both Robo1 and Robo4 are present in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and have knocked expression down using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. Roundabout knockout endothelial cells were then studied in a variety of in vitro assays. We also performed a yeast 2-hybrid analysis using the intracellular domain of Robo4 as bait to identify interacting proteins and downstream signaling. Both Robo1 and Robo4 siRNA knockdown and transfection of Robo4-green fluorescent protein inhibited endothelial cell movement and disrupted tube formation on Matrigel. Consistent with a role in regulating cell movement, yeast 2-hybrid and glutathione-S-transferase pulldown analyses show Robo4 binding to a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, and WASP-interacting protein actin-nucleating complex. We have further shown that Robo1 forms a heterodimeric complex with Robo4, and that transfection of Robo4GFP into HUVECs induces filopodia formation. We finally show using Robo1 knockdown cells that Robo1 is essential for Robo4-mediated filopodia induction. Our results favor a model whereby Slit2 binding to a Robo1/Robo4 heterodimer activates actin nucleation-promoting factors to promote endothelial cell migration.",M1
18941616,"Evolution of highly polymorphic T cell populations in siblings with the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome.Population level evolutionary processes can occur within a single organism when the germ line contains a mutation that confers a cost at the level of the cell. Here we describe how multiple compensatory mutations arose through a within-individual evolutionary process in two brothers with the immune deficiency Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS). As a result, both brothers have T lymphocyte populations that are highly polymorphic at the locus of the germ line defect, and no single allele achieves fixation. <e>WASP</e>, the gene product affected in this disease, is specific to white blood cells where it is responsible for regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics in a wide range of cellular responses. The brothers inherited a rare allele predicted to result in truncated WASP lacking the carboxy-terminal VCA domains, the region that directly catalyzes actin filament generation. Although the brothers' T cell populations are highly polymorphic, all share a corrective effect relative to the inherited allele in that they restore the VCA domain. This indicates massive selection against the truncated germ line allele. No single somatic allele becomes fixed in the circulating T cell population of either brother, indicating that a regulated step in maturation of the affected cell lineage is severely compromised by the germ line allele. Based on the finding of multiple somatic mutations, the known maturation pathway for T-lineage cells and the known defects of T cells and precursor thymocytes in mice with truncated WASP, we hypothesize that the presence of truncated WASP (WASP Delta VCA) confers an extreme disadvantage in early developing thymocytes, above and beyond the known cost of absence of full-length WASP, and that the disadvantage likely occurs through dominant negative competition of WASP Delta VCA with N-WASP, a protein that otherwise partially compensates for WASP absence in developing thymocytes.",M1

Much is known about the biochemistry of WASp and the migratory capacity of WASp-defective cells in vitro, but in vivo studies of immune-cell behaviour are more challenging. Using the translucency of zebrafish larvae, we live-imaged the effects of morpholino knockdown of WASp1 (also known as Was) on leukocyte migration in response to a wound. In embryos at 22 hours post-fertilisation, primitive macrophages were impaired in their migration towards laser wounds. Once a circulatory system had developed, at 3 days post-fertilisation, we observed significantly reduced recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to ventral fin wounds. Cell-tracking studies indicated that fewer leukocytes leave the vessels adjacent to a wound and those that do exhibit impaired navigational capacity. Their cell morphology appears unaltered but their choice of leading-edge pseudopodia is more frequently incorrect, leading to impaired chemotaxis. We also identified two zebrafish mutants in WASp1 by TILLING, one of which was in the WIP-binding domain that is the hotspot for human lesions, and mutants exhibited the same deficiencies in wound inflammation and thrombus formation as WASp1 morphants.",M1
18772454,"<e>WASP</e> confers selective advantage for specific hematopoietic cell populations and serves a unique role in marginal zone B-cell homeostasis and function.Development of hematopoietic cells depends on a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. Here we demonstrate that expression of the cytoskeletal regulator WASP, mutated in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, provides selective advantage for the development of naturally occurring regulatory T cells, natural killer T cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes, marginal zone (MZ) B cells, MZ macrophages, and platelets. To define the relative contribution of MZ B cells and MZ macrophages for MZ development, we generated wild-type and WASP-deficient bone marrow chimeric mice, with full restoration of the MZ. However, even in the presence of MZ macrophages, only 10% of MZ B cells were of WASP-deficient origin. We show that WASP-deficient MZ B cells hyperproliferate in vivo and fail to respond to sphingosine-1-phosphate, a crucial chemoattractant for MZ B-cell positioning. Abnormalities of the MZ compartment in WASP(-/-) mice lead to aberrant uptake of Staphylococcus aureus and to a reduced immune response to TNP-Ficoll. Moreover, WASP-deficient mice have increased levels of  natural  IgM antibodies. Our findings reveal that WASP regulates both development and function of hematopoietic cells. We demonstrate that WASP deficiency leads to an aberrant MZ that may affect responses to blood-borne pathogens and peripheral B-cell tolerance.",M1

18728185,"Genetically encoded photoswitching of actin assembly through the Cdc42-<e>WASP</e>-Arp2/3 complex pathway.General methods to engineer genetically encoded, reversible, light-mediated control over protein function would be useful in many areas of biomedical research and technology. We describe a system that yields such photo-control over actin assembly. We fused the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 in its GDP-bound form to the photosensory domain of phytochrome B (PhyB) and fused the Cdc42 effector, the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP), to the light-dependent PhyB-binding domain of phytochrome interacting factor 3 (Pif3). Upon red light illumination, the fusion proteins bind each other, activating WASP, and consequently stimulating actin assembly by the WASP target, the Arp2/3 complex. Binding and WASP activation are reversed by far-red illumination. Our approach, in which the biochemical specificity of the nucleotide switch in Cdc42 is overridden by the light-dependent PhyB-Pif3 interaction, should be generally applicable to other GTPase-effector pairs.",M1
18701694,"Nervous wreck and Cdc42 cooperate to regulate endocytic actin assembly during synaptic growth.Regulation of synaptic morphology depends on endocytosis of activated growth signal receptors, but the mechanisms regulating this membrane-trafficking event are unclear. Actin polymerization mediated by Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASp</e>) and the actin-related protein 2/3 complex generates forces at multiple stages of endocytosis. FCH-BIN amphiphysin RVS (F-BAR)/SH3 domain proteins play key roles in this process by coordinating membrane deformation with WASp-dependent actin polymerization. However, it is not known how other WASp ligands, such as the small GTPase Cdc42, coordinate with F-BAR/SH3 proteins to regulate actin polymerization at membranes. Nervous Wreck (Nwk) is a conserved neuronal F-BAR/SH3 protein that localizes to periactive zones at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and is required for regulation of synaptic growth via bone morphogenic protein signaling. Here, we show that Nwk interacts with the endocytic proteins dynamin and Dap160 and functions together with Cdc42 to promote WASp-mediated actin polymerization in vitro and to regulate synaptic growth in vivo. Cdc42 function is associated with Rab11-dependent recycling endosomes, and we show that Rab11 colocalizes with Nwk at the NMJ. Together, our results suggest that synaptic growth activated by growth factor signaling is controlled at an endosomal compartment via coordinated Nwk and Cdc42-dependent actin assembly.",M1
18687984,"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein deficiency in B cells results in impaired peripheral homeostasis.To more precisely identify the B-cell phenotype in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), we used 3 distinct murine in vivo models to define the cell intrinsic requirements for WAS protein (<e>WASp</e>) in central versus peripheral B-cell development. Whereas WASp is dispensable for early bone marrow B-cell development, WASp deficiency results in a marked reduction in each of the major mature peripheral B-cell subsets, exerting the greatest impact on marginal zone and B1a B cells. Using in vivo bromodeoxyuridine labeling and in vitro functional assays, we show that these deficits reflect altered peripheral homeostasis, partially resulting from an impairment in integrin function, rather than a developmental defect. Consistent with these observations, we also show that: (1) WASp expression levels increase with cell maturity, peaking in those subsets exhibiting the greatest sensitivity to WASp deficiency; (2) WASp(+) murine B cells exhibit a marked selective advantage beginning at the late transitional B-cell stage; and (3) a similar in vivo selective advantage is manifest by mature WASp(+) human B cells. Together, our data provide a better understanding of the clinical phenotype of WAS and suggest that gene therapy might be a useful approach to rescue altered B-cell homeostasis in this disease.",M1
18654788,"Identification of a new <e>WASP</e> and FKBP-like (WAFL) protein in inflammatory bowel disease: a potential marker gene for ulcerative colitis.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract with unknown cause that lacks molecular markers for diagnosis. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major forms of IBD. The aim of this study was to investigate gene expression patterns in UC and characterize newly identified marker genes potentially linked to disease pathogenesis of UC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsies were taken from eight UC patients, from inflamed and non-inflamed parts of the colon. Gene expression was investigated by subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH), and further study of a selected gene was performed by Northern blot, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and in vitro monocyte differentiation. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-one differentially expressed genes were found and classified into functional groups. In this paper, we report one gene with unknown function to be differentially expressed in UC but not Crohn's disease by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Due to its predicted protein architecture, we call this gene Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and FKBP-like (WAFL). Initial pilot experiments suggest WAFL to participate in innate immune functions. CONCLUSION: The SSH result supports the current view of UC to be a chronic inflammatory disorder with aberrant expression of epithelial barrier proteins, cell fate-related factors, and disturbed metabolism. The new gene, WAFL, reported in this study, appears to be conditionally regulated in myeloid cells. This indicates that WAFL may be connected to innate immune-host responses. As such, it represents an interesting, hitherto unknown player in IBD where there is a need for further elucidation on the molecular and cellular level.",M1
18650809,"Structural mechanism of <e>WASP</e> activation by the enterohaemorrhagic E. coli effector EspF(U).During infection, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) takes over the actin cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells by injecting the EspF(U) protein into the host cytoplasm. EspF(U) controls actin by activating members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family. Here we show that EspF(U) binds to the autoinhibitory GTPase binding domain (GBD) in WASP proteins and displaces it from the activity-bearing VCA domain (for verprolin homology, central hydrophobic and acidic regions). This interaction potently activates WASP and neural (N)-WASP in vitro and induces localized actin assembly in cells. In the solution structure of the GBD-EspF(U) complex, EspF(U) forms an amphipathic helix that binds the GBD, mimicking interactions of the VCA domain in autoinhibited WASP. Thus, EspF(U) activates WASP by competing directly for the VCA binding site on the GBD. This mechanism is distinct from that used by the eukaryotic activators Cdc42 and SH2 domains, which globally destabilize the GBD fold to release the VCA. Such diversity of mechanism in WASP proteins is distinct from other multimodular systems, and may result from the intrinsically unstructured nature of the isolated GBD and VCA elements. The structural incompatibility of the GBD complexes with EspF(U) and Cdc42/SH2, plus high-affinity EspF(U) binding, enable EHEC to hijack the eukaryotic cytoskeletal machinery effectively.",M1
18606666,"Expression of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein in dendritic cells regulates synapse formation and activation of naive CD8+ T cells.The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASp</e>) is a key regulator of actin polimerization in hematopoietic cells. Mutations in WASp cause a severe immunodeficiency characterized by defective initiation of primary immune response and autoimmunity. The contribution of altered dendritic cells (DCs) functions to the disease pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we show that conventional DCs develop normally in WASp-deficient mice. However, Ag targeting to lymphoid organ-resident DCs via anti-DEC205 results in impaired naive CD8(+) T cell activation, especially at low Ag doses. Altered trafficking of Ag-bearing DCs to lymph nodes (LNs) accounts only partially for defective priming because correction of DCs migration does not rescue T cell activation. In vitro and in vivo imaging of DC-T cell interactions in LNs showed that cytoskeletal alterations in WASp null DCs causes a reduction in the ability to form and stabilize conjugates with naive CD8(+) T lymphocytes both in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate that WASp expression in DCs regulates both the ability to traffic to secondary lymphoid organs and to activate naive T cells in LNs.",M1
18483558,"Conserved mosquito/parasite interactions affect development of Plasmodium falciparum in Africa.In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the mosquito Anopheles gambiae is the main vector of the major human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Convenient laboratory studies have identified mosquito genes that affect positively or negatively the developmental cycle of the model rodent parasite, P. berghei. Here, we use transcription profiling and reverse genetics to explore whether five disparate mosquito gene regulators of P. berghei development are also pertinent to A. gambiae/P. falciparum interactions in semi-natural conditions, using field isolates of this parasite and geographically related mosquitoes. We detected broadly similar albeit not identical transcriptional responses of these genes to the two parasite species. Gene silencing established that two genes affect similarly both parasites: infections are hindered by the intracellular local activator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, <e>WASP</e>, but promoted by the hemolymph lipid transporter, ApoII/I. Since P. berghei is not a natural parasite of A. gambiae, these data suggest that the effects of these genes have not been drastically altered by constant interaction and co-evolution of A. gambiae and P. falciparum; this conclusion allowed us to investigate further the mode of action of these two genes in the laboratory model system using a suite of genetic tools and infection assays. We showed that both genes act at the level of midgut invasion during the parasite's developmental transition from ookinete to oocyst. ApoII/I also affects the early stages of oocyst development. These are the first mosquito genes whose significant effects on P. falciparum field isolates have been established by direct experimentation. Importantly, they validate for semi-field human malaria transmission the concept of parasite antagonists and agonists.",M1

Both patients suffered from severe WAS caused by a nonsense mutation in exon 1 of the WAS gene. In both siblings, flow cytometric analysis revealed the presence of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASp</e>)-positive and WASp-negative cell populations among T and B lymphocytes as well as natural killer (NK) cells. In contrast to previously described cases of revertant mosaicism in WAS, molecular analyses in both children showed that the WASp-positive T cells, B cells, and NK cells carried multiple different second-site mutations, resulting in different missense mutations.

The scattering data support a model in which the first actin subunit binds at the barbed end of Arp2, and disqualify an alternative model that places the first actin subunit at the barbed end of Arp3. This location of the first actin and bound W motif constrains the binding site of the C motif to subunits Arp2 and ARPC1, from where the A motif can reach subunits Arp3 and ARPC3.

Within host cells, IcsA activates the host actin regulatory protein, neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-<e>WASP</e>), which in turn recruits the Arp2/3 complex, which nucleates host actin to form F-actin comet tails and initiate bacterial motility. Linker insertion mutagenesis was undertaken to randomly introduce 5-amino-acid in-frame insertions within IcsA. Forty-seven linker insertion mutants were isolated and expressed in S. flexneri Delta icsA strains. Mutants were characterized for IcsA protein production, cell surface expression and localization, intercellular spreading, F-actin comet tail formation, and N-WASP recruitment. Using this approach, we have identified a putative autochaperone region required for IcsA biogenesis, and our data suggest an additional region, not previously identified, is required for N-WASP recruitment.",M1

We show that IRSp53 interacts directly with neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-<e>WASP</e>) via its SH3 domain and furthermore that N-WASP is required for filopodia formation as IRSp53 failed to induce filopodia formation in N-WASP knock-out (KO) fibroblasts.

IRSp53 failed to induce filopodia in mammalian enabled (Mena)/VASP KO cells, and N-WASP failed to induce filopodia when IRSp53 was knocked down with RNA interference. The IRSp53 I-BAR domain alone induces dynamic membrane protrusions that lack actin and are smaller than normal filopodia ( partial-filopodia ) in both wild-type N-WASP and N-WASP KO cells. We propose that IRSp53 generates filopodia by coupling membrane protrusion through its I-BAR domain with actin dynamics through SH3 domain binding partners, including N-WASP and Mena.",M1
18388318,"<e>WASP</e> and SCAR have distinct roles in activating the Arp2/3 complex during myoblast fusion.Myoblast fusion takes place in two steps in mammals and in Drosophila. First, founder cells (FCs) and fusion-competent myoblasts (FCMs) fuse to form a trinucleated precursor, which then recruits further FCMs. This process depends on the formation of the fusion-restricted myogenic-adhesive structure (FuRMAS), which contains filamentous actin (F-actin) plugs at the sites of cell contact. Fusion relies on the HEM2 (NAP1) homolog Kette, as well as Blow and WASP, a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich-syndrome protein family. Here, we show the identification and characterization of schwächling--a new Arp3-null allele. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrate that Arp3 schwächling mutants can form a fusion pore, but fail to integrate the fusing FCM. Double-mutant experiments revealed that fusion is blocked completely in Arp3 and wasp double mutants, suggesting the involvement of a further F-actin regulator. Indeed, double-mutant analyses with scar/WAVE and with the WASP-interacting partner vrp1 (sltr, wip)/WIP show that the F-actin regulator scar also controls F-actin formation during myoblast fusion. Furthermore, the synergistic phenotype observed in Arp3 wasp and in scar vrp1 double mutants suggests that WASP and SCAR have distinct roles in controlling F-actin formation. From these findings we derived a new model for actin regulation during myoblast fusion.",M1
18346836,"Rapid platelet turnover in <e>WASP</e>(-) mice correlates with increased ex vivo phagocytosis of opsonized WASP(-) platelets.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine a mechanism for the thrombocytopenia of murine Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consumption rates of WAS protein (WASP)(-) and wild-type (WT) platelets were measured by injection of 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA)-labeled platelets into WT or WASP(-) recipients, and by in vivo biotinylation. Platelet and reticulated platelet counts were performed using quantitative flow cytometry. Bone marrow megakaryocyte number and ploidy was assessed by flow cytometry. Phagocytosis of CMFDA-labeled, opsonized platelets was assessed using bone marrow-derived macrophages. Serum antiplatelet antibodies were assayed via their binding to WT platelets. RESULTS: CMFDA-labeled WASP(-) platelets are consumed more rapidly than WT platelets in either WT or WASP(-) recipients. In vivo biotinylation studies corroborate these findings and show a normal consumption rate for WASP(-) reticulated platelets. The number of reticulated platelets is reduced in WASP(-) mice, but a significant number of the mice show an increased proportion of reticulated platelets and more severe thrombocytopenia. Sera from some of the latter group contain antiplatelet antibodies. Compared to WT platelets, WASP(-) platelets opsonized with anti-CD61 or 6A6 antibody are taken up more rapidly by bone marrow-derived macrophages. In vivo consumption rates of WASP(-) platelets are more accelerated by opsonization than are those of WT platelets. CONCLUSION: Both rapid clearance and impaired production contribute to the thrombocytopenia of murine WAS. Increased susceptibility of opsonized WASP(-) platelets to phagocytosis leads to increased in vivo clearance. This correlates with a higher incidence of individuals with an elevated fraction of reticulated platelets, a more severe thrombocytopenia, and antiplatelet antibodies.",M1
18332229,"Unprecedented diversity of genotypic revertants in lymphocytes of a patient with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.Spontaneous somatic reversions of inherited mutations are poorly understood phenomena that are thought to occur uncommonly in a variety of genetic disorders. When molecularly characterized, revertant cells have rarely exhibited more than one revertant genotype per patient. We analyzed individual allospecific T-cell clones derived from a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patient identified by flow cytometry to have 10% to 15% revertant, WAS protein-expressing lymphocytes in his blood. Genotypic analysis of the clones revealed a remarkable diversity of deletions and base substitutions resulting in at least 34 different revertant genotypes that restored expression of <e>WASp</e>. A large fraction of these revertant genotypes were also identified in primary T cells purified from peripheral blood. These data suggest that the use of sensitive methods may reveal the presence of wide arrays of individual genotypic revertants in WAS patients and offer opportunities for further understanding of their occurrence.",M1
18323794,"Improved lentiviral vectors for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome gene therapy mimic endogenous expression profiles throughout haematopoiesis.Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) gene therapy requires highly efficient and well-controlled vectors. Here we studied the performance of a lentiviral vector (LV) harbouring a 500-bp fragment of the WAS proximal promoter (WW), which we previously characterized as haematopoietic-specific and capable of restoring WAS phenotype in patients' T cells. We used an LV (WE) expressing eGFP to evaluate whether this promoter was following the expression pattern of endogenous <e>WASp</e>. Transgene expression was analysed in WE-transduced hCD34+ population and its progeny after in vitro and in vivo differentiation in the Rag2-/-, gammac-/- humanized mouse. We revealed very poor expression from the WE internal promoter in macrophages and erythroid cells. Therefore, we designed a novel LV including a fragment of the alternative WAS promoter in WE vector (AWE). This new vector sustained high transgene levels along the whole lymphoid lineage in vivo. Most importantly, the performance of AWE vector was highly superior to WE vector since AWE clearly improved transgene levels in in vitro and in vivo hCD34+-derived macrophages, erythroid cells, megakaryocytes and B cells while supporting a high expression in human T cells. This emphasizes that it is a suitable LV backbone for gene therapy of haematopoietic diseases such as WAS.",M1
18240968,"Hematopoietic-specific lentiviral vectors circumvent cellular toxicity due to ectopic expression of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein.Efficient and safe gene modification of hematopoietic stem cells is a requirement for gene therapy of primary immunodeficiencies such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. However, deregulated expression or ectopic expression in the progeny of transduced nonhematopoietic progenitor cells may lead to unwanted toxicity. We therefore analyzed the effect of ectopic expression of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASp</e>) and the potential benefits of hematopoietic-specific lentiviral vectors (driven by the WAS proximal promoter). Overexpression of WASp by constitutive lentiviral vectors is highly toxic in nonhematopoietic cells because it causes dramatic changes in actin localization and polymerization that result in decreased cell viability, as evidenced by a significant growth disadvantage of WASp-overexpressing nonhematopoietic cells and increased cell death. These toxic effects do not affect cells of hematopoietic origin because, remarkably, we found that WASp cannot be readily overexpressed in T cells, even after multiple vector integrations per cell. The adverse cellular effects found after transduction of nonhematopoietic cells with constitutive lentiviral vectors are overcome by the use of transcriptionally targeted lentiviral vectors expressing WASp, which, at the same time, are efficient tools for gene therapy of WAS as demonstrated by their ability to reconstitute cellular defects from WASp-deficient mouse and human cells. We therefore postulate that transcriptionally regulated lentiviral vectors represent a safer and efficient alternative for the development of clinical protocols of WAS gene therapy.",M1
18234795,"Identification of a hydrophobic domain of HA2 essential to morphogenesis of Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus.The HA2 protein of the Helicoverpa armigera single-nucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) is a <e>WASP</e> homology protein capable of nucleating branched actin filaments in the presence of the Arp2/3 complex in vitro. To determine the role of ha2 in the HearNPV life cycle, ha2 knockout and ha2 repair bacmids were constructed. Transfection and infection analysis demonstrated that the ha2 null bacmid was unable to produce infectious budded virus (BV), while the repair bacmid rescued the defect. In vitro analysis demonstrated that the WCA domain of HA2 accelerates Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly and is indispensable to the function of HA2. However, analysis of the repaired recombinant with a series of truncated ha2 mutants demonstrated that the WCA domain was essential but not enough to yield infectious virions, and a hydrophobic domain (H domain) consisting of amino acids (aa) 167 to 193 played a pivotal role in the production of BV. Subcellular localization analysis with enhanced green fluorescent protein fusions showed that the H domain functioned as a nuclear localization signal. In addition, deletion of the C terminus of the ha2 product, a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase homolog, dramatically decreased the viral titer, while deletion of 128 aa from the N terminus did not affect HA2 function.",M1

These findings fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Then he developed atopic dermatitislike eczema, which led to the consideration of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS).

18043243,"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is caused by mutations of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein gene, which codes for a cytoplasmic protein with multiple functions. This review will focus on recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and its ramifications for the cure of this lethal disease. RECENT FINDINGS: The discovery of the causative gene has revealed a spectrum of clinical phenotypes demonstrating a strong genotype/phenotype correlation. The discovery of unique functional domains of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein has been instrumental in defining mechanisms that control activation of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Long-term follow up of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has led to important modifications of the procedure. Studies of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-deficient cell lines and <e>wasp</e>-knockout mice have paved the way for possible gene therapy. SUMMARY: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein gene mutations result in four clinical phenotypes: classic Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and X-linked thrombocytopenia, intermittent thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein is a signaling molecule and instrumental for cognate and innate immunity, cell motility and protection against autoimmune disease. The success of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is related to the recipient's age, donor selection, the conditioning regimen and the extent of reconstitution. Since Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic stem cells, and because Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein exerts a strong selective pressure, gene therapy is expected to cure the disease.",M1
17949983,"<e>WASP</e>-interacting protein (WIP): working in polymerisation and much more.The migration of cells and the movement of some intracellular pathogens, such as Shigella and Vaccinia, are dependent on the actin-based cytoskeleton. Many proteins are involved in regulating the dynamics of the actin-based microfilaments within cells and, among them, WASP and N-WASP have a significant role in the regulation of actin polymerisation. The activity and stability of WASP is regulated by its cellular partner WASP-interacting protein (WIP) during the formation of actin-rich structures, including the immune synapse, filopodia, lamellipodia, stress fibres and podosomes. Here, we review the role of WIP in regulating WASP function by stabilising WASP and shuttling WASP to areas of actin assembly in addition to reviewing the WASP-independent functions of WIP.",M1
17898081,"CD44 and beta3 integrin organize two functionally distinct actin-based domains in osteoclasts.The actin cytoskeleton of mature osteoclasts (OCs) adhering to nonmineralized substrates is organized in a belt of podosomes reminiscent of the sealing zone (SZ) found in bone resorbing OCs. In this study, we demonstrate that the belt is composed of two functionally different actin-based domains: podosome cores linked with CD44, which are involved in cell adhesion, and a diffuse cloud associated with beta3 integrin, which is involved in cell adhesion and contraction. Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (<e>WASp</e>) Interacting Protein (WIP)-/- OCs were devoid of podosomes, but they still exhibited actin clouds. Indeed, WIP-/- OCs show diminished expression of WASp, which is required for podosome formation. CD44 is a novel marker of OC podosome cores and the first nonintegrin receptor detected in these structures. The importance of CD44 is revealed by showing that its clustering restores podosome cores and WASp expression in WIP-/- OCs. However, although CD44 signals are sufficient to form a SZ, the presence of WIP is indispensable for the formation of a fully functional SZ.",M1
17890224,"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein is a key regulator of the phagocytic cup formation in macrophages.Phagocytosis is a vital first-line host defense mechanism against infection involving the ingestion and digestion of foreign materials such as bacteria by specialized cells, phagocytes. For phagocytes to ingest the foreign materials, they form an actin-based membrane structure called phagocytic cup at the plasma membranes. Formation of the phagocytic cup is impaired in phagocytes from patients with a genetic immunodeficiency disorder, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). The gene defective in WAS encodes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASP</e>). Mutation or deletion of WASP causes impaired formation of the phagocytic cup, suggesting that WASP plays an important role in the phagocytic cup formation. However, the molecular details of its formation remain unknown. We have shown that the WASP C-terminal activity is critical for the phagocytic cup formation in macrophages. We demonstrated that WASP is phosphorylated on tyrosine 291 in macrophages, and the WASP phosphorylation is important for the phagocytic cup formation. In addition, we showed that WASP and WASP-interacting protein (WIP) form a complex at the phagocytic cup and that the WASP.WIP complex plays a critical role in the phagocytic cup formation. Our results indicate that the phosphorylation of WASP and the complex formation of WASP with WIP are the essential molecular steps for the efficient formation of the phagocytic cup in macrophages, suggesting a possible disease mechanism underlying phagocytic defects and recurrent infections in WAS patients.",M1
17878299,"Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASP</e>) and N-WASP are critical for T cell development.Although T cell dysfunction and lymphopenia are key features of immunodeficient patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-deficient mice, T cell development appears relatively normal. We hypothesized that N-WASP, a ubiquitously expressed homologue of WASP, may serve a redundant function with WASP. To examine the unique and redundant activities of WASP and N-WASP, we generated ES cells devoid of WASP and N-WASP [double knockout (DKO)] and used the RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation system to generate DKO lymphocytes. Moreover, we mated WASP KO mice with mice containing a conditionally targeted N-WASP allele and used the Cre-loxP system to generate mice lacking WASP and N-WASP in T cells [conditional DKO (cDKO)]. In both systems, N-WASP-deficient cells were indistinguishable from WT cells. In contrast, T cell development in DKO and cDKO mice was markedly altered, as shown by thymic hypocellularity and reduced numbers of peripheral T cells. We found that the combined activity of WASP and N-WASP was important for CD4(-)CD8(-) double-negative (DN)-to-CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) cell transition, and this may be partly explained by reduced cycling DN3 cells. In addition, decreased migratory responses of CD4(+)CD8(-) and CD4(-)CD8(+) single-positive (SP) cells and increased percentage of CD69(low)CD24(low) and CD62L(low) SP cells in cDKO cells imply retention of SP cells in the thymus. In summary, this study suggests that, although WASP serves a unique role for peripheral T cell function, T cell development depends on the combined activity of WASP and N-WASP.",M1
17854313,"<e>WASP</e> localizes to the membrane skeleton of platelets.Patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), an X-linked blood cell disease, suffer from severe thrombocytopenia due to accelerated loss of defective platelets. The affected gene encodes WASP, an actin regulatory protein thought to reside in the cytoplasm of resting leucocytes. In contrast, this study showed that, for platelets, one-quarter of WASP molecules fractionate in the detergent-insoluble high speed pellet characterized as the membrane skeleton, the scaffold structure that underlies the lipid bilayer and stabilizes the surface membrane. Following treatment of platelets with thrombin and stirring, which induces cytoarchitectural remodelling, WASP and other membrane skeletal components sedimented at lower g force and partitioned in the low-speed pellet. Thrombin and stirring also induced WASP tyrosine phosphorylation, a rapid activating reaction, and proteolytic inactivation by cysteine protease calpain. Both the alteration of the sedimentation profile and the proteolytic inactivation were specific for the membrane skeletal pool of WASP and were abrogated in alphaIIb beta3 integrin-deficient platelets and in normal platelets treated with an integrin antagonist. The findings demonstrate that WASP is a component of the resting platelet membrane skeleton and participates in membrane skeletal rearrangements downstream of integrin outside-in signalling. The possible implications for the platelet defect in WAS are discussed.",M1
17786274,"Novel membrane cell projection defects in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome B cells.Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked immunodeficiency characterized by microthrombocytopenia, eczema, recurrent infections, autoimmune disorders and an increased incidence of malignancies. This complex phenotype results from mutations in the <e>WASP</e> gene. WASP is a key member of a protein family that links signaling pathways to actin cytoskeleton reorganization by activating Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. Actin polymerization defects have been extensively defined in WAS T cells and also in dendritic cells and macrophages, but few reports have concentrated on WAS B cells. In the present study, we investigated cytoskeleton abnormalities in WAS B cell lines. For the first time we report alterations in the capacity of these cells to extend filopodia in response to bradykinin stimuli and an impairment in the formation of long pseudopodia under basal conditions. Such alterations most probably result from a WASP dysfunction, given that a retroviral gene transfer of a corrected form of the WASP gene was able to rescue the abnormal phenotypes.",M1
17785506,"Cdc42-interacting protein-4 functionally links actin and microtubule networks at the cytolytic NK cell immunological synapse.An essential function of the immunological synapse (IS) is directed secretion. NK cells are especially adept at this activity, as they direct lytic granules to the synapse for secretion, which enables cytotoxicity and facilitates host defense. This initially requires rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and, subsequently, microtubule-dependent trafficking of the lytic granules. As these two steps are sequential, specific linkages between them are likely to serve as critical regulators of cytotoxicity. We studied Cdc42-interacting protein-4 (CIP4), which constitutively interacts with tubulin and microtubules but focuses to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) after NK cell activation, when it is able to associate with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASp</e>) and the actin filament-rich IS. WASp deficiency, overexpression of CIP4, or parts of CIP4 interfere with this union and block normal CIP4 localization, MTOC polarization to the IS, and cytotoxicity. Reduction of endogenous CIP4 expression using small interfering RNA similarly inhibits MTOC polarization and cytotoxic activity but does not impair actin filament accumulation at the IS, or Cdc42 activation. Thus, CIP4 is an important cytoskeletal adaptor that functions after filamentous actin accumulation and Cdc42 activation to enable MTOC polarization and NK cell cytotoxicity.",M1
17764675,"Lymphocyte-dependent and Th2 cytokine-associated colitis in mice deficient in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Controversy exists as to whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease have an underlying immunodeficiency. We have focused on a murine model of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an immunodeficiency in which autoimmunity can manifest in the form of an inflammatory bowel disease-like illness. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASP</e>) deficiency in mice results in similar clinical features. Herein, we characterized the colitis in WASP-deficient mice. METHODS: WASP-deficient mice were followed clinically and histologically. Immunologic studies were performed to determine the pathogenic cell population(s), the predominant cytokine expression pattern, and the role of cytokine(s) in colitis pathogenesis. RESULTS: All WASP-deficient mice develop colitis by 6 months of age. Lymphocytes are required for disease induction, and CD4(+) T cells from WASP-deficient mice are sufficient to induce disease in lymphocyte-deficient hosts. Lamina propria preparations from WASP-deficient mice demonstrated elevations in interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-13 levels but decreased IL-6 and no difference in IL-17 expression in comparison with wild-type controls. Treatment with neutralizing antibody to IL-4, but not to interferon-gamma, abrogated colitis development. However, mice deficient in both WASP and IL-4 showed no difference in histologic colitis scores at 24 weeks of age compared with WASP-deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a critical role for lymphocytes and a relative T helper 2 cytokine predominance in the colitis associated with WASP-deficient mice. This is the only model of colitis with elevated T helper 2 cytokines and aberrant natural regulatory T cell function and is unique in having a human disease counterpart with similar defects.",M1
17724125,"Unregulated actin polymerization by <e>WASp</e> causes defects of mitosis and cytokinesis in X-linked neutropenia.Specific mutations in the human gene encoding the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) that compromise normal auto-inhibition of WASp result in unregulated activation of the actin-related protein 2/3 complex and increased actin polymerizing activity. These activating mutations are associated with an X-linked form of neutropenia with an intrinsic failure of myelopoiesis and an increase in the incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities. To study the underlying mechanisms, active mutant WASp(I294T) was expressed by gene transfer. This caused enhanced and delocalized actin polymerization throughout the cell, decreased proliferation, and increased apoptosis. Cells became binucleated, suggesting a failure of cytokinesis, and micronuclei were formed, indicative of genomic instability. Live cell imaging demonstrated a delay in mitosis from prometaphase to anaphase and confirmed that multinucleation was a result of aborted cytokinesis. During mitosis, filamentous actin was abnormally localized around the spindle and chromosomes throughout their alignment and separation, and it accumulated within the cleavage furrow around the spindle midzone. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for inhibition of myelopoiesis through defective mitosis and cytokinesis due to hyperactivation and mislocalization of actin polymerization.",M1
17719003,"Optimization of short hairpin RNA for lentiviral-mediated RNAi against WAS.The expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) with lentiviral vectors is useful to induce stable RNA interference, particularly in hematopoietic cells. Since primary cells integrate few copies of vector, we tested if several shRNA cassette modifications could improve knock-down efficacy. Using two shRNA sequences previously shown to inhibit the human WAS gene expression, we found that neither increasing the shRNA stem length from 19-nt to 29-nt, nor modifying the loop with 4-nt, 9-nt artificial loops or with the mir30 loop improved vector-induced shRNA efficacies. This cautions against extrapolating results obtained with synthetic molecules to shRNAs that are stably expressed from viral vectors. On the other hand, the duplication of the shRNA expression cassette resulted in twice as much knock-down per copy of integrated vector. This strategy allowed a strong suppression of <e>WASp</e> in CD34(+) cells and will facilitate future studies on the role of WASp in human cells.",M1
17711847,"Structure-function analysis of the WIP role in T cell receptor-stimulated NFAT activation: evidence that WIP-<e>WASP</e> dissociation is not required and that the WIP NH2 terminus is inhibitory.WASP and its binding partner WIP play important roles in T cells both in actin polymerization and in interleukin-2 transcription. Aberrations thereof contribute to the pathology of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). To directly evaluate the cooperativity of WIP and WASP in interleukin-2 transcription, we investigated how the WIP-WASP complex regulates NF-AT-mediated gene transcription. We developed an improved model system for analysis, using WIP and WASP cotransfection into Jurkat cells, in which strong induction of NFAT reporter activation is observed with anti-T cell receptor (TCR) antibody without the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate usually used previously. Using this system, our findings contradict a prevailing conceptual model of TCR-induced WIP-WASP dissociation by showing in three ways that the WIP-WASP complex mediates TCR-induced NFAT activation without dissociation. First, phosphorylation of WIP Ser(488) does not cause dissociation of the WIP-WASP complex. Second, WIP-WASP complexes do not dissociate demonstrably after TCR stimulation. Third, a fusion protein of WIP to WASP efficiently mediates NFAT activation. Next, our studies clarify that WIP stabilization of WASP explains otherwise unexpected results in TCR-induced NFAT activation. Finally, we find that the NH(2) terminus of WIP is a highly inhibitory region for TCR-mediated transcriptional activation in which at least two elements contribute: the NH(2)-terminal polyproline and the NH(2)-terminal actin-binding WH2 domain. This suggests that WIP, like WASP, is subject to autoinhibition. Our data indicate that the WIP-WASP complex plays an important role in WASP stabilization and NFAT activation.",M1
17703096,"Clinical aspects and molecular analysis of Chinese patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome in Taiwan.BACKGROUND: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked immunodeficiency, characterized by microthrombocytopenia, eczema and recurrent infections. More than 441 patient mutations have been described all over the world, mainly based on Caucasian and Japanese people. There have been few reported cases involving Chinese WAS patients. OBJECTIVE: We investigated Chinese WAS patients in Taiwan since 1980. METHODS: All WAS patients met the diagnosis criteria. Clinical manifestations, immunological functions, gene sequencing and the WAS protein (<e>WASP</e>) expression were analyzed. RESULTS: Eleven male Chinese WAS patients were enrolled, presenting as classic WAS phenotype, correlative to the expression level of WASP and the severity of infections. Seven patients had autoimmune disorders, encompassing autoimmune hemolysis in 4, lymphoproliferative disorders in 2 and ulcerative colitis in 1 patient. As well as prophylactic monthly intravenous immunoglobulin infusion, splenectomy was performed on 2 patients. Five patients received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The causes of mortality were mass bleeding, sepsis and Epstein Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders in 3 nontransplant patients and acute graft failure and cytomegalovirus pneumonitis in 2 transplant patients. Nine patients received genetic analysis and revealed 4 unique mutations. None had the X-linked thrombocytopenia phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: All of the recognized Chinese WAS patients had the classic phenotype. Most mutations involved exon 1 of the WASP gene and none had the X-linked thrombocytopenia phenotype. This may be attributable to genetic variation, although selection bias may exist.",M1
17698982,"Impaired LPS-induced signaling in microglia overexpressing the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein N-terminal domain.Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (<e>WASP</e>) plays important roles in TCR signaling, but its roles in signal transduction in innate immune cells have not been well characterized. As microglia are the primary immune effector cells in the brain, WASP may possibly have important roles in microglial activation, such as production of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic factors. Here, we established a microglial cell line from WASP dominant-negative transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing the N-terminal enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1 (EVH1) domain. WASP Tg microglia were impaired in production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta upon LPS stimulation, whereas anti-inflammatory IL-10 production was significantly enhanced. Also, LPS-induced phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappaB was reduced in WASP Tg microglia. Furthermore, WASP Tg microglia exhibited less cytotoxicity against co-cultured neurons after stimulation by LPS and IFN-gamma, with a concordant decrease in nitric oxide production. These results strongly suggest that WASP may have pivotal roles through the EVH1 domain in the LPS signaling cascade, either directly or indirectly, and modulates inflammatory immune responses in microglia.",M1

Budapest, Hungary October 4-7, 2006.The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a primary immunodeficiency disease caused by mutations in the Wiskott-Aldrich Protein (<e>WASP</e>) gene, which typically leads to absent WASP protein expression in WAS leukocytes. However, some patients have been found with small populations of WASP-expressing cells caused by reverse or second-site mutations that allow protein expression. An international consortium was established to further investigate these phenomena. This paper summarizes data collected by this consortium that was presented at a workshop held during the XIIth Meeting of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID), October, 2006. WASP reversions were noted in approximately 11% of 272 patients tested. Many different cell lineages showed reversions. These data form the foundation for further investigation into this phenomenon, which has implications for therapy of this disease.",M1

17673604,"Impaired T-cell priming in vivo resulting from dysfunction of <e>WASp</e>-deficient dendritic cells.The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is characterized by defective cytoskeletal dynamics affecting multiple immune cell lineages, and leading to immunodeficiency and autoimmunity. The contribution of dendritic cell (DC) dysfunction to the immune dysregulation has not been defined, although both immature and mature WAS knockout (KO) DCs exhibit significant abnormalities of chemotaxis and migration. To exclude environmental confounders as a result of WAS protein (WASp) deficiency, we studied migration and priming activity of WAS KO DCs in vivo after adoptive transfer into wild-type recipient mice. Homing to draining lymph nodes was reduced and WAS KO DCs failed to localize efficiently in T-cell areas. Priming of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes by WAS KO DCs preloaded with antigen was significantly decreased. At low doses of antigen, activation of preprimed wild-type CD4(+) T lymphocytes by WAS KO DCs in vitro was also abrogated, suggesting that there is a threshold-dependent impairment even if successful DC-T cell colocalization is achieved. Our data indicate that intrinsic DC dysfunction due to WASp deficiency directly impairs the T-cell priming response in vivo, most likely as a result of inefficient migration, but also possibly influenced by suboptimal DC-mediated cognate interaction.",M1
17635585,"Verprolin function in endocytosis and actin organization. Roles of the Las17p (yeast <e>WASP</e>)-binding domain and a novel C-terminal actin-binding domain.Vrp1p (verprolin, End5p) is the yeast ortholog of human Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-interacting protein (WIP). Vrp1p localizes to the cortical actin cytoskeleton, is necessary for its polarization to sites of growth and is also essential for endocytosis. At elevated temperature, Vrp1p becomes essential for growth. A C-terminal Vrp1p fragment (C-Vrp1p) retains the ability to localize to the cortical actin cytoskeleton and function in actin-cytoskeleton polarization, endocytosis and growth. Here, we demonstrate that two submodules in C-Vrp1p are required for actin-cytoskeleton polarization: a novel C-terminal actin-binding submodule (CABS) that contains a novel G-actin-binding domain, which we call a verprolin homology 2 C-terminal (VH2-C) domain; and a second submodule comprising the Las17p-binding domain (LBD) that binds Las17p (yeast WASP). The LBD localizes C-Vrp1p to membranes and the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Intriguingly, the LBD is sufficient to restore endocytosis and growth at elevated temperature to Vrp1p-deficient cells. The CABS also restores these functions, but only if modified by a lipid anchor to provide membrane association. Our findings highlight the role of Las17p binding for Vrp1p membrane association, suggest general membrane association may be more important than specific targeting to the cortical actin cytoskeleton for Vrp1p function in endocytosis and cell growth, and suggest that Vrp1p binding to individual effectors may alter their physiological activity.",M1
20503864,"Diffusive coevolution and mutualism maintenance mechanisms in a fig-fig <e>wasp</e> system.In reciprocal mutualism systems, the exploitation events by exploiters might disrupt the reciprocal mutualism, wherein one exploiter species might even exclude other coexisting exploiter species over an evolutionary time frame. What remains unclear is how such a community is maintained. Niche partitioning, or spatial heterogeneity among the mutualists and exploiters, is generally believed to enable stability within a mutualistic system. However, our examination of a reciprocal mutualism between a fig species (Ficus racemosa) and its pollinator wasp (Ceratosolen fusciceps) shows that spatial niche partitioning does not sufficiently prevent exploiters from overexploiting the common resource (i.e., the female flowers), because of the considerable niche overlap between the mutualists and exploiters. In response to an exploiter, our experiment shows that the fig can (1) abort syconia-containing flowers that have been galled by the exploiter, Apocryptophagus testacea, which oviposits before the pollinators do; and (2) retain syconia-containing flowers galled by Apocryptophagus mayri, which oviposit later than pollinators. However, as a result of (2), there is decreased development of adult non-pollinators or pollinator species in syconia that have not been sufficiently pollinated, but not aborted. Such discriminative abortion of figs or reduction in offspring development of exploiters while rewarding cooperative individuals with higher offspring development by the fig will increase the fitness of cooperative pollinating wasps, but decrease the fitness of exploiters. The fig-fig wasp interactions are diffusively coevolved, a case in which fig wasps diversify their genotype, phenotype, or behavior as a result of competition between wasps, while figs diverge their strategies to facilitate the evolution of cooperative fig waps or lessen the detrimental behavior by associated fig wasps. In habitats or syconia that suffer overexploitation, discriminative abortion of figs or reduction in the offspring development of exploiters in syconia that are not or not sufficiently pollinated will decrease exploiter fitness and perhaps even drive the population of exploiters to local extinction, enabling the evolution and maintenance of cooperative pollinators through the movement between habitats or syconia (i.e., the metapopulations).",M2
20456233,"Parasitoid fig-<e>wasp</e> evolutionary diversification and variation in ecological opportunity.Ecological processes are manifest in the evolution and form of phenotype diversity. The great abundance of parasitoid species has led to speculation whether rates of speciation and extinction are dependent on parasitoid diversity. If these factors are mutually exclusive, species diversity should fluctuate instead of remaining relatively constant over time. It is not known whether radiations constrained by coevolutionary interactions conform to density-dependent diversification processes. Here we test the prediction that parasitoid fig wasp diversification responds to changes in ecological opportunity and density-independent processes. A phylogenetic approach is used to estimate relative divergence times and infer diversification rate changes using gamma-statistics. Monte Carlo constant rates tests that accommodate incomplete sampling could not reject constant rates diversification. Parasitoid fig wasp diversification is consistent with a more complex explanation than density-dependent cladogenesis. The results suggest contemporary African parasitoid fig wasp diversity remains a legacy of an ancient ecological opportunity facilitated by fig tree diversification following the breakup of Pan-African forests and evolution of the savanna biome over the last 55 Ma and the more recent aridification of the African continent in the last 5 Ma. These results imply that amplified phenotypic differentiation of specialist insects coevolving with plants is coupled to evolutionarily infrequent changes in ecological opportunity.",M2
20431014,"Maternal control of haplodiploid sex determination in the <e>wasp</e> Nasonia.All insects in the order Hymenoptera have haplodiploid sex determination, in which males emerge from haploid unfertilized eggs and females are diploid. Sex determination in the honeybee Apis mellifera is controlled by the complementary sex determination (csd) locus, but the mechanisms controlling sex determination in other Hymenoptera without csd are unknown. We identified the sex-determination system of the parasitic wasp Nasonia, which has no csd locus. Instead, maternal input of Nasonia vitripennis transformer (Nvtra) messenger RNA, in combination with specific zygotic Nvtra transcription, in which Nvtra autoregulates female-specific splicing, is essential for female development. Our data indicate that males develop as a result of maternal imprinting that prevents zygotic transcription of the maternally derived Nvtra allele in unfertilized eggs. Upon fertilization, zygotic Nvtra transcription is initiated, which autoregulates the female-specific transcript, leading to female development.",M2
20423614,"A SERI technique reveals an immunosuppressive activity of a serine-rich protein encoded in Cotesia plutellae bracovirus.Polydnavirus genome is segmented and dispersed on host <e>wasp</e> chromosome. After replication, the segments form double- stranded circular DNAs and embedded in viral coat proteins. These viral particles are delivered into a parasitized host along with parasitoid eggs. A serine-rich protein (SRP) is predicted in a polydnavirus, Cotesia plutellae bracovirus (CpBV), genome in its segment no. 33 (CpBV-S33), creating CpBVSRP1. This study explored its expression and physiological function in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, larvae parasitized by C. plutellae. CpBV-SRP1 encodes 122 amino acids with 26 serines and several predicted phosphorylation sites. It is persistently expressed in all tested tissues of parasitized P. xylostella including hemocyte, fat body, and gut. Its physiological function was analyzed by injecting CpBV-S33 and inducing its expression in nonparasitized P. xylostella by a technique called SERI (segment expression and RNA interference). The expression of CpBV-SRP1 significantly impaired the spreading behavior and total cell count of hemocytes of treated larvae. Subsequent RNA interference of CpBV-SRP1 rescued the immunosuppressive response. This study reports the persistent expression of CpBV-SRP1 in a parasitized host and its parasitic role in suppressing the host immune response by altering hemocyte behavior and survival.",M2
20388271,"Conditional mutualism between Allodynerus delphinalis (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) and Ensliniella parasitica (Astigmata: Winterschmidtiidae) may determine maximum parasitic mite infestation.Mutualism is a prominent interaction within ecosystems, yet most may actually be conditional. The symbiotic mite, Ensliniella parasitica Vitzthum, ingests the hemolymph of juvenile potter <e>wasps</e>, Allodynerus delphinalis (Giraud), but also protects them from a natural enemy, Melittobia acasta, and is transported to new nests in host pockets specialized for this purpose (i.e., acarinaria). Thus, two different antagonisms from the mite may arise: commensalistic cheating is expected without the natural enemy of the host, and parasitism is predicted with excessive numbers of the mite. However, facultative parasitism mediated by mutualism has rarely been studied in any organism. We found no significant differences in juvenile mortality, nesting rate, or fecundity between mite-free and naturally mite-laden juveniles. However, when overloaded with mites ( approximately 1.5-2.5 times more mites than the maximum number per wasp larva in the field), the developmental period of the male wasp was significantly delayed, and juvenile wasp mortality increased to 30%. These results show that mutualism mediated by parasitism may revert to parasitism, suggesting that either or both organisms in a mutualism mediated by parasitism need population control of the parasite to avoid the risk of parasitism.",M2
20345674,"Ecology, Wolbachia infection frequency and mode of reproduction in the parasitoid <e>wasp</e> Tetrastichus coeruleus (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae).Whereas sexual reproduction may facilitate adaptation to complex environments with many biotic interactions, simplified environments are expected to favour asexual reproduction. In agreement with this, recent studies on invertebrates have shown a prevalence of asexual species in agricultural (simplified) but not in natural (complex) environments. We investigated whether the same correlation between reproductive mode and habitat can be found in different populations within one species. The parasitoid wasp Tetrastichus coeruleus forms an ideal model to test this question, since it occurs both in natural and agricultural environments. Further, we investigated whether Wolbachia infection caused parthenogenesis in female-biased populations. In contrast to the general pattern, in Dutch and French natural areas, we found Wolbachia-infected, highly female-biased populations that reproduce parthenogenetically. In contrast, populations on Dutch agricultural fields were not infected with Wolbachia, showed higher frequencies of males and reproduced sexually. However, we also found a female-only, Wolbachia-infected population on agricultural fields in north-eastern United States. All Wolbachia-infected populations were infected with the same Wolbachia strain. At this moment, we do not have a convincing explanation for this deviation from the general pattern of ecology and reproductive mode. It may be that asparagus agricultural fields differ from other crop fields in ways that favour sexual reproduction. Alternatively, Wolbachia may manipulate life history traits in its host, resulting in different fitness pay-offs in different habitats. The fixation of Wolbachia in the United States populations (where the species was introduced) may be due to founder effect and lack of uninfected, sexual source populations.",M2
20338545,"Emergence and dispersal relative to natal nest in the digger <e>wasp</e> Stizus continuus (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae).The position of the emerging point has rarely been investigated as a factor possibly affecting the future nest settlement behaviour in Hymenoptera, in particular within nest aggregations. We studied the emergence and dispersion patterns of the digger wasp Stizus continuus. Individuals emerged daily in clumped patterns, possibly revealing a certain synchrony of emergence from the same nests, and protandry appeared both at seasonal and daily level. Differences between the number of females that nested relatively close or far from their emergence holes (EH) were either significant or not, depending on the year, and observed dispersal distances from the natal nests did not differ from those obtained by random simulations. By contrast, females nested close to the nearest conspecific nest. Size did not affect the dispersion patterns. EH are thus not important cues for nest establishment, and conspecific nests are probably the key cue for nest-founding females. In addition, males did not prefer to establish territories close to their natal nest.",M2

This was confirmed by real-time relative qPCR for insect miRNAs (dme-mir-1, -8, -14, -184, -276, -277, -279, -289, -let-7) using miRNA-specific TaqMan assays.

20302424,"The condition dependence and heritability of signaling and nonsignaling color traits in paper <e>wasps</e>.Research on quality signal development typically focuses on signals with production costs; less is known about signals that lack production costs (conventional signals). Here, I test the condition dependence and heritability of the facial patterns that function as a conventional signal of quality in Polistes dominulus wasps. Two aspects of facial patterns are compared: (1) amount of black pigment (no signal value) and (2) disruption in the black pigment's distribution (quality signal). When colonies received the same diet, they produced offspring with similar facial patterns and both traits were heritable. However, experimental diet manipulation substantially influenced quality signal development. Wasps fed unlimited caterpillars developed more disrupted facial patterns than wasps fed a restricted diet. Further, signal heritability was obscured following the diet treatment. In contrast, the nonsignaling trait was not influenced by the diet treatment and remained heritable. Overall, the quality signal in P. dominulus is condition dependent and heritable, but its heritability may be obscured by environmental variance. The nonsignaling aspect of wasp facial patterns is not condition dependent and is more consistently heritable across environments. Therefore, the information a signal conveys may be influenced by its developmental properties rather than its honesty-ensuring cost or the pigments that constitute it.",M2
20238237,"Regulation of reproduction in the primitively eusocial <e>wasp</e> Ropalidia marginata: on the trail of the queen pheromone.Queens and workers are not morphologically differentiated in the primitively eusocial wasp, Ropalidia marginata. Upon removal of the queen, one of the workers becomes extremely aggressive, but immediately drops her aggression if the queen is returned. If the queen is not returned, this hyper-aggressive individual, the potential queen (PQ), will develop her ovaries, lose her hyper-aggression, and become the next colony queen. Because of the non-aggressive nature of the queen, and because the PQ loses her aggression by the time she starts laying eggs, we hypothesized that regulation of worker reproduction in R. marginata is mediated by pheromones rather than by physical aggression. Based on the immediate loss of aggression by the PQ upon return of the queen, we developed a bioassay to test whether the queen's Dufour's gland is, at least, one of the sources of the queen pheromone. Macerates of the queen's Dufour's gland, but not that of the worker's Dufour's gland, mimic the queen in making the PQ decrease her aggression. We also correctly distinguished queens and workers of R. marginata nests by a discriminant function analysis based on the chemical composition of their respective Dufour's glands.",M2

20176334,"Nest relocation and high mortality rate in a Neotropical social <e>wasp</e>: Impact of an exceptionally rainy La Niña year.After noting the forecast of a La Niña episode, associated with heavy rainfall in French Guiana, we monitored the fate of wasp nests before and during the 2006 short rainy season. The population of the most abundant epiponine wasp species, Polybia bistriata, decreased dramatically during the short rainy season (60.6% of the nests disappeared) then remained low for at least 18 months. Colonies that survived moved from the shelter of large, low leaves (a situation well adapted to the previous dry season) of the most frequent substrate tree, Clusia grandiflora (Clusiaceae), to upper leaves, better ventilated and whose orientation provides good protection from the rain. Therefore, the possibility of moving the nest higher during the first rains following the dry season seems very adaptive as colonies that do not do so are eliminated during the La Niña years, whose frequency will increase with global climate change.",M2
20167026,"Inventory and phylogenomic distribution of meiotic genes in Nasonia vitripennis and among diverse arthropods.The parasitoid jewel <e>wasp</e> Nasonia vitripennis reproduces by haplodiploidy (arrhenotokous parthenogenesis). In diploid females, meiosis occurs during oogenesis, but in haploid males spermatogenesis is ameiotic and involves a single equational division. Here we describe the phylogenomic distribution of meiotic genes in N. vitripennis and in 10 additional arthropods. Homologues for 39 meiosis-related genes (including seven meiosis-specific genes) were identified in N. vitripennis. The meiotic genes missing from N. vitripennis are also sporadically absent in other arthropods, suggesting that certain meiotic genes are dispensable for meiosis. Among an additional set of 15 genes thought to be specific for male meiosis in Drosophila, two genes (bol and crl) were identified in N. vitripennis and Apis mellifera (both for which canonical meiosis is absent in males) and in other arthropods. The distribution of meiotic genes across arthropods and the impact of gene duplications and reproductive modes on meiotic gene evolution are discussed.",M2
20167024,"Organization, evolution and transcriptional profile of hexamerin genes of the parasitic <e>wasp</e> Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae).Hexamerins and prophenoloxidases (PPOs) proteins are members of the arthropod-haemocyanin superfamily. In contrast to haemocyanin and PPO, hexamerins do not bind oxygen, but mainly play a role as storage proteins that supply amino acids for insect metamorphosis. We identified seven genes encoding hexamerins, three encoding PPOs, and one hexamerin pseudogene in the genome of the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. A phylogenetic analysis of hexamerins and PPOs from this wasp and related proteins from other insect orders suggests an essentially order-specific radiation of hexamerins. Temporal and spatial transcriptional profiles of N. vitripennis hexamerins suggest that they have physiological functions other than metamorphosis, which are arguably coupled with its lifestyle.",M2

In the insect chemoreceptor superfamily, Nasonia has 58 gustatory receptor (Gr) genes, of which 11 are pseudogenes, leaving 47 apparently intact proteins encoded. No carbon dioxide receptors, two candidate sugar receptors, a DmGr43a orthologue, and several additional Gr lineages were identified, including significant gene subfamily expansions related to the 10 Grs found in the honey bee Apis mellifera. Nasonia has a total of 301 odorant receptor (Or) genes, of which 76 are pseudogenes, leaving 225 apparently intact Ors. Phylogenetic comparison with the 174 honey bee Ors reveals differential gene subfamily expansion in each hymenopteran lineage, along with a few losses from each species. The only simple orthologous relationship is the expected single DmOr83b orthologue. The large number of Nasonia Ors is the result of several major subfamily expansions, including one of 55 genes. Nasonia does not have the elaborate social chemical communication of honey bees, nor the diversity of floral odours honey bees detect, however, Nasonia wasps might need to detect a diversity of odours to find potential mates and hosts or avoid harmful substances in its environment.",M2

Despite this widespread use, the evolutionary processes governing microsatellite distribution and diversity remain controversial. Here, we present results on the distribution of microsatellites of three species in the parasitic wasp genus Nasonia generated by an in silico data-mining approach. Our results show that the overall microsatellite density in Nasonia is comparable to that of the honey bee, but much higher than in eight non-Hymenopteran arthropods. Across the Nasonia vitripennis genome, microsatellite density varied both within and amongst chromosomes. In contrast to other taxa, dinucleotides are the most abundant repeat type in all four species of Hymenoptera studied. Whether the differences between the Hymenoptera and other taxa are of functional significance remains to be determined.",M2

The genome sequence data from this study are the first for a male-killing bacterium, and represent a microorganism that is unusual compared with other sequenced symbionts, in having routine vertical and horizontal transmission, two alternating hosts, and being culturable on cell-free media. The resulting sequence totals c. 3.5 Mbp and is annotated to contain 3332 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). Therefore, Arsenophonus represents a relatively large genome for an insect symbiont. The annotated ORF set suggests that the microbe is capable of a broad array of metabolic functions, well beyond those found for reproductive parasite genomes sequenced to date and more akin to horizontally transmitted and secondary symbionts. We also find evidence of genetic transfer from Wolbachia symbionts, and phage exchange with other gammaproteobacterial symbionts. These findings reflect the complex biology of a bacterium that is able to live, invade and survive multiple host environments while resisting immune responses.",M2
20167015,"Transfers of mitochondrial DNA to the nuclear genome in the <e>wasp</e> Nasonia vitripennis.Many organisms carry nuclear sequences of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs).

The total amount of NUMTs in Nasonia is 42 972 bp exceeding over four-fold that found in Tribolium castaneum and almost fifty-fold that found in Drosophila melanogaster, whereas Apis mellifera has an even larger number of NUMTs in its genome (over 230 kb). The Nasonia NUMTs were inserted by multiple independent events and frequently involved large fragments spanning multiple mitochondrial genes. Most of the NUMTs are recent transfers that occurred less than one million years ago after the speciation of N. vitripennis. Duplications and rearrangements in the nucleus have also occurred.

First, we searched for the transcripts of venom proteins by a bioinformatic approach using amino acid sequences of known hymenopteran venom proteins. Second, we performed proteomic analyses of crude N. vitripennis venom removed from the venom reservoir, implementing both an off-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight (2D-LC-MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and a two-dimensional liquid chromatography electrospray ionization Founer transform ion cyclotron resonance (2D-LC-ESI-FT-ICR) MS setup. This combination of bioinformatic and proteomic studies resulted in an extraordinary richness of identified venom constituents. Moreover, half of the 79 identified proteins were not yet associated with insect venoms: 16 proteins showed similarity only to known proteins from other tissues or secretions, and an additional 23 did not show similarity to any known protein. Serine proteases and their inhibitors were the most represented. Fifteen nonsecretory proteins were also identified by proteomic means and probably represent so-called 'venom trace elements'.

BlastP searching revealed a strong identity with only two proteins from other insect species: the jewel <e>wasp</e>, Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera), and the green pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera). In higher organisms, C1q is the first subcomponent of the classical complement pathway and constitutes a major link between innate and acquired immunity. Expression of C1q-VP in a variety of tissues of honey bee workers and drones was demonstrated. In addition, a wide spatial and temporal pattern of expression was observed in N. vitripennis. We suggest that C1q-VP represents a new member of the emerging group of venom trace elements. Using degenerate primers the corresponding gene was found to be highly conserved in eight hymenopteran species, including species of the Aculeata and the Parasitica groups (suborder Apocrita) and even the suborder Symphyta.

In the present study, we analyzed the kairomonal response of this <e>wasp</e> to the male-produced sex pheromone of a host, the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella, an economically important pest of honeybees, Apis mellifera. Coupled gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) revealed three compounds in headspace collections from male G. mellonella that elicited responses from B. hebetor antennae: decanal and the previously identified sex pheromone components, nonanal and undecanal. Y-tube olfactometer tests that used naïve, mated wasps showed that females, but not males, were highly attracted to (a) male G. mellonella headspace samples, (b) two synthetic blends of nonanal and undecanal (in ratios matching that found in male moth samples), and (c) the two aldehydes tested individually. Further, female wasps did not discriminate between a blend of aldehydes and male G. mellonella headspace. In dose-response trials that used octanal, nonanal, decanal, and undecanal, no difference in EAG responses of the two sexes was observed, except for undecanal at the second highest dose, for which female antennae showed significantly larger responses than did male antennae. When the two binary blends were tested at different doses, female wasps were significantly attracted to the two highest doses (1 microg and 10 microg), but not to the lowest dose (100 ng).

These include a short generation time, ease of rearing, interfertile species, visible and molecular markers, and a sequenced genome. However, the Nasonia species normally are completely or partially reproductively isolated owing to Wolbachia, widespread intracellular bacteria found in arthropods and nematodes. Wolbachia cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in Nasonia. Although the current genome-sequenced strains of Nasonia (AsymCX, IV7[u], RV2X[u]) are all Wolbachia-free, crosses between infected and uninfected wasps, or between infected wasps of different species, will fail because of Wolbachia. The sperm modification that induces CI appears to be established before the adult stage, so it is generally not possible to cure an infection and break the CI barrier in the same generation. However, a Wolbachia infection can be removed from a strain over a number of generations by feeding antibiotics and selecting on females showing partial CI.

20147035,"The parasitoid <e>wasp</e> Nasonia: an emerging model system with haploid male genetics.Nasonia is a complex of four closely related species of wasps that is rapidly emerging as a model for evolutionary and developmental genetics. It has several features that make it an excellent genetic system, including a short generation time, ease of rearing, interfertile species, visible and molecular markers, and a sequenced genome. The form of sex determination, called  haplodiploidy,  makes Nasonia particularly suitable as a genetic tool. Females are diploid and develop from fertilized eggs, whereas males are haploid and develop from unfertilized eggs. This allows geneticists to exploit many of the advantages of haploid genetics in an otherwise complex eukaryotic organism. Nasonia readily inbreeds, permitting production of isogenic lines, and the four species in the genus are interfertile (after removal of the endosymbiont Wolbachia), facilitating movement of genes between the species for efficient positional cloning of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Genome sequencing of the genetic model Nasonia vitripennis and two interfertile species, Nasonia giraulti and Nasonia longicornis, is now completed. This genome project provides a wealth of interspecies polymorphisms (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], insertion-deletions [indels], microsatellites) to facilitate positional cloning of genes involved in species differences in behavior, morphology, and development. Advances in the genetics of this system also open a path for improvement of parasitoid insects as agents of pest control.",M2
20136056,"Impact of organophosphorus insecticide, malathion on the progeny sex ratio of Pimpla turionellae L.The effects of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 0.5 ppm concentrations of malathion, an organophosphorus insecticide, viewed over the course of the experiment, on adult emergence and sex ratios of emerging adults of the parasitic <e>wasp</e>, Pimpla turionellae L. (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) were investigated. Diets which contain 0.001 and 0.01 ppm malathion significantly increased the total adult emergence on day 13, 28 and 31 when compared to control diet. Although 0.01 and 0.1 ppm malathion increased the female emergence, higher concentration of malathion (0.5 ppm) significantly decreased the female emergence. Adult female emergence significantly decreased on day 10, 16 and 25 in the group which was fed with the meridic diet containing 0.5 ppm malathion. This study indicated that orally administrated high concentration of malathion (0.5 ppm) significantly decreased female emergence of P. turionellae.",M2
20126523,"Functional characterization of transcription factor motifs using cross-species comparison across large evolutionary distances.We address the problem of finding statistically significant associations between cis-regulatory motifs and functional gene sets, in order to understand the biological roles of transcription factors. We develop a computational framework for this task, whose features include a new statistical score for motif scanning, the use of different scores for predicting targets of different motifs, and new ways to deal with redundancies among significant motif-function associations. This framework is applied to the recently sequenced genome of the jewel <e>wasp</e>, Nasonia vitripennis, making use of the existing knowledge of motifs and gene annotations in another insect genome, that of the fruitfly. The framework uses cross-species comparison to improve the specificity of its predictions, and does so without relying upon non-coding sequence alignment. It is therefore well suited for comparative genomics across large evolutionary divergences, where existing alignment-based methods are not applicable. We also apply the framework to find motifs associated with socially regulated gene sets in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, using comparisons with Nasonia, a solitary species, to identify honeybee-specific associations.",M2

In this report, a case of severe peripheral quadriparesis and sphincteric disorder (urinary incontinence) in a 10-year-old boy occurring within 24 hours after wasp sting is presented. Corticosteroids had very good therapeutic effect, and improvement in clinical status was observed within 72 hours. The exact pathogenic mechanism of peripheral nervous system damage is not very well known. Several studies have suggested that besides the neurotoxic effect of wasp venom, delayed immunological response to wasp antigens followed by an allergy-triggered autoimmune reaction is possible. Wasp venom may activate an allergic reaction or effects by toxic impacts; however, typical clinical symptoms of allergic reaction are not necessarily present.",M2
20096300,"Differential gene expression profiles in the venom gland/sac of Eumenes pomiformis (Hymenoptera: Eumenidae).To search for novel transcripts encoding biologically active venom components, a subtractive cDNA library specific to the venom gland and sac (gland/sac) of a solitary hunting <e>wasp</e> species, Eumenes pomiformis Fabricius (1781), was constructed by suppression subtractive hybridization. A total of 541 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were clustered and assembled into 102 contigs (31 multiple sequences and 71 singletons). In total, 37 cDNAs were found in the library via BLASTx searching and manual annotation. Eight contigs (337 ESTs) encoding short venom peptides (10 to 16 amino acids) occupied 62% of the library. The deduced amino acid sequence (78 amino acids) of a novel venom peptide transcript shared sequence similarity with trypsin inhibitors and dendrotoxin-like venom peptides known to be K(+) channel blockers, implying that this novel peptide may play a role in the paralysis of prey. In addition to phospholipase A2 and hyaluronidase, which are known to be the main components of wasp venoms, several transcripts encoding enzymes, including three metallopeptidases and a decarboxylase likely involved in the processing and activation of venomous proteins, peptides, amines, and neurotransmitters, were also isolated from the library. The presence of a transcript encoding a putative insulin/insulin-like peptide binding protein suggests that solitary hunting wasps use their venom to control their prey, leading to larval growth cessation. The abundance of these venom components in the venom gland/sac and in the alimentary canal was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Discovery of venom gland/sac-specific transcripts should promote further studies on biologically active components in the venom of solitary hunting wasps.",M2
20087411,"Recombination and its impact on the genome of the haplodiploid parasitoid <e>wasp</e> Nasonia.Homologous meiotic recombination occurs in most sexually reproducing organisms, yet its evolutionary advantages are elusive. Previous research explored recombination in the honeybee, a eusocial hymenopteran with an exceptionally high genome-wide recombination rate. A comparable study in a non-social member of the Hymenoptera that would disentangle the impact of sociality from Hymenoptera-specific features such as haplodiploidy on the evolution of the high genome-wide recombination rate in social Hymenoptera is missing. Utilizing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between two Nasonia parasitoid wasp genomes, we developed a SNP genotyping microarray to infer a high-density linkage map for Nasonia. The map comprises 1,255 markers with an average distance of 0.3 cM. The mapped markers enabled us to arrange 265 scaffolds of the Nasonia genome assembly 1.0 on the linkage map, representing 63.6% of the assembled N. vitripennis genome. We estimated a genome-wide recombination rate of 1.4-1.5 cM/Mb for Nasonia, which is less than one tenth of the rate reported for the honeybee. The local recombination rate in Nasonia is positively correlated with the distance to the center of the linkage groups, GC content, and the proportion of simple repeats. In contrast to the honeybee genome, gene density in the parasitoid wasp genome is positively associated with the recombination rate; regions of low recombination are characterized by fewer genes with larger introns and by a greater distance between genes. Finally, we found that genes in regions of the genome with a low recombination frequency tend to have a higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, likely due to the accumulation of slightly deleterious non-synonymous substitutions. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that recombination reduces interference between linked sites and thereby facilitates adaptive evolution and the purging of deleterious mutations. Our results imply that the genomes of haplodiploid and of diploid higher eukaryotes do not differ systematically in their recombination rates and associated parameters.",M2
20087396,"Phylogeography of Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera) indicates a mitochondrial-Wolbachia sweep in North America.Here we report evidence of a mitochondrial-Wolbachia sweep in North American populations of the parasitoid <e>wasp</e> Nasonia vitripennis, a cosmopolitan species and emerging model organism for evolutionary and genetic studies. Analysis of the genetic variation of 89 N. vitripennis specimens from Europe and North America was performed using four types of genetic markers: a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene, nine polymorphic nuclear microsatellites, sequences from 11 single-copy nuclear markers and six Wolbachia genes. The results show that the European populations have a sevenfold higher mitochondrial sequence variation than North American populations, but similar levels of microsatellite and nuclear gene sequence variation. Variation in the North American mitochondria is extremely low (pi=0.31%), despite a highly elevated mutation rate (approximately 35-40 times higher than the nuclear genes) in the mitochondria of Nasonia. The data are indicative of a mitochondrial sweep in the North American population, possibly due to Wolbachia infections that are maternally co-inherited with the mitochondria. Owing to similar levels of nuclear variation, the data could not resolve whether N. vitripennis originated in the New or the Old World.",M2
20087392,"The cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel gene superfamily of the parasitoid <e>wasp</e>, Nasonia vitripennis.Members of the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel (cysLGIC) superfamily mediate chemical neurotransmission and are studied extensively as potential targets of drugs used to treat neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Insect cys-loop LGICs also have central roles in the nervous system and are targets of highly successful insecticides. Here, we describe the cysLGIC superfamily of the parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, which is emerging as a highly useful model organism and is deployed as a biological control of insect pests. The wasp superfamily consists of 26 genes, which is the largest insect cysLGIC superfamily characterized, whereas Drosophila melanogaster, Apis mellifera and Tribolium castaneum have 23, 21 and 24, respectively. As with Apis, Drosophila and Tribolium, Nasonia possesses ion channels predicted to be gated by acetylcholine, gamma-amino butyric acid, glutamate and histamine, as well as orthologues of the Drosophila pH-sensitive chloride channel (pHCl), CG8916 and CG12344. Similar to other insects, wasp cysLGIC diversity is broadened by alternative splicing and RNA A-to-I editing, which may also serve to generate species-specific receptor isoforms. These findings on N. vitripennis enhance our understanding of cysLGIC functional genomics and provide a useful basis for the study of their function in the wasp model, as well as for the development of improved insecticides that spare a major beneficial insect species.",M2
20087390,"Evolution of sex-specific wing shape at the widerwing locus in four species of Nasonia.How do morphological differences between species evolve at the genetic level? This study investigates the genetic basis of recent divergence in male wing size between species of the model parasitoid <e>wasp</e> Nasonia. The forewings of flightless Nasonia vitripennis males are 2.3 times smaller than males of their flighted sister species N. giraulti. We describe a major genetic contributor to this difference: the sex-specific widerwing (wdw) locus, which we have backcrossed from N. giraulti into N. vitripennis and mapped to an 0.9 megabase region of chromosome 1. This introgression of wdw from large-winged N. giraulti into small-winged N. vitripennis increases male but not female forewing width by 30% through wing region-specific size changes. Indirect evidence suggests that cell number changes across the wing explain the majority of the wdw wing-size difference, whereas changes in cell size are important in the center of the wing. Introgressing the same locus from the other species in the genus, N. longicornis and N. oneida, into N. vitripennis produces intermediate and large male wing sizes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to introgress a morphological quantitative trait locus (QTL) from multiple species into a common genetic background. Epistatic interactions between wdw and other QTL are also identified by introgressing wdw from N. vitripennis into N. giraulti. The main findings are (1) the changes at wdw have sex- and region-specific effects and could, therefore, be regulatory, (2) the wdw locus seems to be a co-regulator of cell size and cell number, and (3) the wdw locus has evolved different wing width effects in three species.",M2
20086130,"Hydrocarbon rank signatures correlate with differential oophagy and dominance behaviour in Polistes dominulus foundresses.Social life offers animals increased fitness opportunities. However, the advantages are not evenly distributed and some individuals benefit more than others. The ultimate advantage of reaching the highest rank in a dominance hierarchy is the achievement of reproduction monopoly. In social insects, dominant individuals and queens keep their reproductive control through differential oophagy of unwanted eggs (egg policing). Egg recognition is the main proximate mechanism for maintaining reproductive dominance. In the social <e>wasp</e> Polistes dominulus, subordinate queens often lay eggs in the presence of the dominant individual. Combining gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and laboratory bioassays, we found that chemical differences between eggs of subordinate and dominant foundresses can explain the differential success in oophagy enjoyed by dominant individuals. We propose that dominance behaviour is an investigative behaviour as well as a ritualized agonistic behaviour. In fact, the frequency of dominance acts increases with the chemical similarity of the surfaces of dominant- and subordinate-laid eggs. Therefore, dominant individuals probably perform dominance behaviour to test the cuticular signatures of subordinates and so better assess the chemical profiles of subordinate eggs. Finally, we provide evidence that in particular social contexts, subordinate Polistes foundresses can develop ovaries as large as those of dominant individuals but nevertheless lay very few eggs. The subordinates probably lay a limited number of eggs to avoid unnecessary energy loss, as a result of efficient queen policing, but will start laying eggs as soon as the queen fails.",M2

20069726,"Variable selection patterns on the labellum shape of Geoblasta pennicillata, a sexually deceptive orchid.By mimicking shape and female mating pheromones, flowers of sexually deceptive orchids attract sexually excited males which pollinate them while trying to copulate. Although many studies have demonstrated the crucial importance of odour signals in these systems, most flowers pollinated by pseudocopulation resemble, at least superficially, an insect body and these visual cues may be important to cheat pollinators. In this 2-year study, we show that the shape of the labellum of Geoblasta pennicillata is a target of pollinator-mediated natural selection. Contrary to our expectations, plants with a labellum shape more similar to female <e>wasps</e> were not favoured. The strength and pattern of phenotypic selection varied between study years and sexual functions. Although selection through female success was probably associated to the fine-tuning of the mechanical fit between flower form and male wasp, shape was the target of natural selection through male success in both study years indicating that male wasps use this trait when choosing flowers. The imperfect mimicry and patterns of selection observed indicated that an exact imitation is not needed to attract and deceive the pollinators and they suggested a receiver perceptual bias towards uncommon phenotypes.",M2
20050768,"Distribution and abundance of parasites of the rhodesgrass mealybug, Antonina graminis: reassessment of a classic example of biological control in the Southeastern United States.Control of the rhodesgrass mealybug, Antonina graminis Maskell (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), by the encyrtid <e>wasp</e> Neodusmetia sangwani is considered a textbook example of classical biological control. However, recent evidence suggests that A. graminis is abundant in the southeastern United States and no recent surveys have been conducted to determine the status of N. sangwani or other A. graminis parasites. A survey was conducted and it was found that N. sangwani was uncommon overall, occurring at only 20 percent of survey sites. In addition, N. sangwani exhibited a patchy geographic distribution. Possible causes for these results are that N. sangwani has not dispersed widely since its introduction, or that the imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, is interfering with biological control. These results suggest that a reevaluation of the efficacy of biological control may be necessary. The survey also found two other encyrtid wasps utilizing A. graminis as a host. One, Acerophagus sp., is apparently native and was nearly as frequent as N. sangwani, while the other, Pseudectroma sp., is apparently introduced and relatively rare.",M2

The aim of the present work is the identification of: 1) its cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences, 2) its subunits organization and 3) its activity. The cDNA of AtAGA coded for a proalphabeta precursor molecule preceded by a signal peptide of 19 amino acids. The gene products were detected specifically in the wasp venom gland (in which it could be found) under two forms: an (active) heterotetramer composed of two alpha and two beta subunits of 30 and 18 kDa respectively and a homodimer of 44 kDa precursor. The activity of AtAGA enzyme showed a limited tolerance toward variations of pH and temperatures. Since the enzyme failed to exhibit any glycopeptide N-glycosidase activity toward entire glycoproteins, its activity seemed to be restricted to the deglycosylation of free glycosylasparagines like human AGA, indicating AtAGA did not evolve a broader function in the course of evolution. The study of this enzyme may allow a better understanding of the functional evolution of venom enzymes in hymenopteran parasitoids.",M2
20021756,"Fluctuations in richness and abundance of social <e>wasps</e> during the dry and wet seasons in three phyto-physiognomies at the tropical dry forest of Brazil.The social wasp nests were quantified in three different plant physiognomies (forested Caatinga, shrubby Caatinga, and agricultural systems) to analyze the effect of environmental seasonality and plant physiognomy on the richness, nest abundance, and species composition of social wasps in the region of tropical dry forest of Brazil. The forested Caatinga physiognomy had the greatest richness of species (S = 16), followed by shrubby Caatinga (S = 13) and by agricultural system (S = 12). The first axis of detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) explained 67.8% of the variability and shows a gradient of the fauna from agricultural system and shrubby Caatinga to forested Caatinga. In the first axis, wet season scores were much higher than those for the dry season in forested Caatinga. The second axis explained 18.7% of the variability and shows a separation of samples collected during the wet or the dry periods in shrubby Caatinga. This separation was less evident in the agricultural system. Variations in nest abundance were more intense in arbustive caatinga (45% decrease in number of active nests in the dry period), moderate in forested Caatinga (24% decrease in number of active nests in the dry period), and low in agricultural systems (8% decrease in the dry period).",M2
20020167,"What matters in the associative learning of visual cues in foraging parasitoid <e>wasps</e>: colour or brightness?Visual cues are known to be used by numerous animal taxa to gather information on quality and localisation of resources. Because environmental lighting can interfere with the spectral features of visual cues, the specific characteristics of the colour signals that promote forager decision and learning are still not known in the majority of insects (excepted in bees). We analysed the effect of previous experience on the use of visual information by the wasp Venturia canescens, a parasitoid of pyralidae, in the context of host searching. These parasitoids search for hosts concealed in several fruit species, so visual cues from the host microhabitat could play a key role in host finding. We also investigated the type of visual cues on which wasps based their decision. We tested whether wasps are able to associate an achromatic cue (brightness) or a chromatic one (hue, i.e. dominant wavelength and/or chroma) with the presence of hosts. Our results show that in the context of host foraging, chromatic cues are more reliable than brightness in achieving the associative learning process. Therefore, understanding the behavioural ecology of foraging should make use of the knowledge about the visual information used.",M2
19950104,"Novel antimicrobial peptides identified from an endoparasitic <e>wasp</e> cDNA library.We screened an endoparasitic wasp (Pteromalus puparum) cDNA library for DNA sequences having antimicrobial activity using a vital dye exclusion assay. Two dozens of clones were isolated that inhibited the growth of host Escherichia coli cells due to expression of the cloned genes. Three peptides (PP13, PP102 and PP113) were synthesized chemically based on the amino acid sequences deduced from these clones and assayed for their antimicrobial activity. These peptides have net positive charges and are active against both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, but are not active against fungi tested. Their hemolytic activity on human red blood cells was measured, and no hemolytic activity was observed after 1-h incubation at a concentration of 62.5 microM or below. A Blast search indicated that the three peptides have not been previously characterized as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Salt-dependency studies revealed that the biocidal activity of these peptides against E. coli decreased with increasing concentration of NaCl. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) examination of PP13-treated E. coli cells showed extensive damage of cell membranes. The CD spectroscopy studies noted that the enhanced alpha-helical characteristics of PP13 strongly contribute to its higher antimicrobial properties. These results demonstrate the feasibility to identify novel AMPs by screening the expressional cDNA library.",M2

19931793," Heparinization  and hyperfibrinogenolysis by <e>wasp</e> sting.We report on a patient with coagulation abnormalities induced by a wasp sting anaphylaxis. First, we observed an unclottable activated partial thromboplastin time and a significant anti-Xa activity (equivalent to a therapeutic heparin range), whereas the patient had received no heparin. This phenomenon is probably due to activated mast cells that release mediators such as heparin and tryptase. Heparin can then act as an anticoagulant by binding to antithrombin. This  heparinization  explains the anti-Xa activity contributing to the unclottable activated partial thromboplastin time detected in our patient. Second, we noted an extremely low fibrinogen level in the presence of normal platelet count and only a slight increase of D-dimers (absence of important disseminated intravascular coagulation). This is probably due to serum tryptase released during massive mast cell activation. Tryptase cleaves the alpha and beta chains of fibrinogen. This results in the removal of the thrombin cleavage site and of the critical polymerization site from the fibrinogen beta chain. Thrombin- initiated clot formation is therefore inhibited. Tryptase also acts directly on the fibrinolytic pathway by activating the single-chain urinary-type plasminogen activator, resulting in conversion of plasminogen into plasmin and therefore degradation of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors. This hyperfibrinogenolysis explains both the prolonged clotting times and the low fibrinogen level observed. Although our patient did not bleed, in other settings (trauma, during surgery) patients with anaphylaxis may present bleeding disorders. Although the mechanisms underlying these abnormalities have been described in vitro and in vivo animal trials, this is the first time they are described in a human clinical setting.",M2
19928457,"Sex ratio in two species of Pegoscapus <e>wasps</e> (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae) that develop in figs: can wasps do mathematics, or play sex ratio games?The fig pollinating wasps (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae) have obligate arrhenotoky and a breeding structure that fits local mate competition (LMC). It has been traditionally assumed that LMC organisms adjust the sex ratio by laying a greater proportion of male eggs when there is superparasitism (several foundresses in a host). We tested the assumption with two wasp species, Pegoscapus silvestrii, pollinator of Ficus pertusa and Pegoscapus tonduzi, pollinator of Ficus eximia (= F citrifolia), in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Total number of wasps and seeds were recorded in individual isolated naturally colonized syconia. There was a constant additive effect between the number of foundresses and the number of males produced in the brood of a syconium, while the number of females decreased. Both wasp species seem to have precise sex ratios and probably lay the male eggs first in the sequence, independently of superparasitism and clutch size: consequently, they have a non-random sex allocation. Each syconium of Ficus pertusa and of F. eximia colonized by one foundress had similar mean numbers of females, males, and seeds. The two species of wasps studied do not seem to adjust the sex ratio when there is superparasitism. Pollinating fig wasp behavior is better explained by those models not assuming that females do mathematical calculations according to other females' sex ratios, size, number of foundresses, genetic constitution, clutch size or environmental conditions inside the syconium. Our results are in agreement with the constant male number hypothesis, not with sex ratio games.",M2
19915668,"Interference competition and high temperatures reduce the virulence of fig <e>wasps</e> and stabilize a fig-wasp mutualism.Fig trees are pollinated by fig wasps, which also oviposit in female flowers. The wasp larvae gall and eat developing seeds. Although fig trees benefit from allowing wasps to oviposit, because the wasp offspring disperse pollen, figs must prevent wasps from ovipositing in all flowers, or seed production would cease, and the mutualism would go extinct. In Ficus racemosa, we find that syconia ('figs') that have few foundresses (ovipositing wasps) are underexploited in the summer (few seeds, few galls, many empty ovules) and are overexploited in the winter (few seeds, many galls, few empty ovules). Conversely, syconia with many foundresses produce intermediate numbers of galls and seeds, regardless of season. We use experiments to explain these patterns, and thus, to explain how this mutualism is maintained. In the hot summer, wasps suffer short lifespans and therefore fail to oviposit in many flowers. In contrast, cooler temperatures in the winter permit longer wasp lifespans, which in turn allows most flowers to be exploited by the wasps. However, even in winter, only in syconia that happen to have few foundresses are most flowers turned into galls. In syconia with higher numbers of foundresses, interference competition reduces foundress lifespans, which reduces the proportion of flowers that are galled. We further show that syconia encourage the entry of multiple foundresses by delaying ostiole closure. Taken together, these factors allow fig trees to reduce galling in the wasp-benign winter and boost galling (and pollination) in the wasp-stressing summer. Interference competition has been shown to reduce virulence in pathogenic bacteria. Our results show that interference also maintains cooperation in a classic, cooperative symbiosis, thus linking theories of virulence and mutualism. More generally, our results reveal how frequency-dependent population regulation can occur in the fig-wasp mutualism, and how a host species can 'set the rules of the game' to ensure mutualistic behavior in its symbionts.",M2
19910534,"Wind-borne insects mediate directional pollen transfer between desert fig trees 160 kilometers apart.The question of how far pollen can move between plants has implications for topics as diverse as habitat fragmentation, conservation management, and the containment of genetically modified crops. The monoecious African fig tree Ficus sycomorus L. relies on the small, short-lived, night-flying, host-specific fig <e>wasp</e> Ceratosolen arabicus Mayr for pollination. We used microsatellite markers to characterize a geographically isolated riparian population of F. sycomorus growing along the Ugab River in the Namib Desert, Namibia, together with paternity analysis of seedlings from known mothers, to map pollen movement within this population. In this way we tracked insect movements between individually recognizable trees by means of their pollen cargo and documented the movement of C. arabicus between known trees separated by more than 160 km, with a mean distance for confirmed successful pollination events of 88.6 km. The predominant observed movement of pollinators was in a westerly direction, toward the sea, reflecting seasonal nighttime wind direction and the wind-borne dispersal of fig wasps. Our results suggest the existence of an extensive panmictic population of trees that are well suited to overcome the effects of geographical isolation.",M2
19904557,"The polyembryonic <e>wasp</e> Copidosoma floridanum produces two castes by differentially parceling the germ line to daughter embryos during embryo proliferation.Eggs of the polyembryonic wasp Copidosoma floridanum undergo a clonal phase of proliferation, which results in the formation of thousands of embryos called secondary morulae and two castes called reproductive and soldier larvae. C. floridanum establishes the germ line early in development, and prior studies indicate that embryos with primordial germ cells (PGCs) develop into reproductive larvae while embryos without PGCs develop into soldiers. However, it is unclear how embryos lacking PGCs form and whether all or only some morulae contribute to the proliferation process. Here, we report that most embryos lacking PGCs form by division of a secondary morula into one daughter embryo that inherits the germ line and another that does not. C. floridanum embryos also incorporate 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), which allows PGCs and other cell types to be labeled during the S phase of the cell cycle. Continuous BrdU labeling indicated that all secondary morulae cycle during the proliferation phase of embryogenesis. Double labeling with BrdU and the mitosis marker anti-phospho-histone H3 indicated that the median length of the G2 phase of the cell cycle was 18 h with a minimum duration of 4 h. Mitosis of PGCs and presumptive somatic stem cells in secondary morulae was asynchronous, but cells of the inner membrane exhibited synchronous mitosis. Overall, our results suggest that all secondary morulae contribute to the formation of new embryos during the proliferation phase of embryogenesis and that PGCs are involved in regulating both proliferation and caste formation.",M2

We carried out hemocyte counts, phagocytosis assays in vitro and antibacterial response in vivo. On the whole, hemocyte load does not seem to be drastically affected by parasitization: a non-significant increase in hemocyte numbers was observed in parasitized wasps as respect to control, while the two dominant hemocyte types were present with similar proportions in both groups. On the other hand, phagocytosis was significantly reduced in hemocytes from parasitized wasps while the antibacterial response seemed to be less effective in control.

19851452,"Wolbachia interferes with ferritin expression and iron metabolism in insects.Wolbachia is an intracellular bacterium generally described as being a facultative reproductive parasite. However, Wolbachia is necessary for oogenesis completion in the <e>wasp</e> Asobara tabida. This dependence has evolved recently as a result of interference with apoptosis during oogenesis. Through comparative transcriptomics between symbiotic and aposymbiotic individuals, we observed a differential expression of ferritin, which forms a complex involved in iron storage. Iron is an essential element that is in limited supply in the cell. However, it is also a highly toxic precursor of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Ferritin has also been shown to play a key role in host-pathogen interactions. Measuring ferritin by quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed that ferritin was upregulated in aposymbiotic compared to symbiotic individuals. Manipulating the iron content in the diet, we showed that iron overload markedly affected wasp development and induced apoptotic processes during oogenesis in A. tabida, suggesting that the regulation of iron homeostasis may also be related to the obligate dependence of the wasp. Finally, we demonstrated that iron metabolism is influenced by the presence of Wolbachia not only in the obligate mutualism with A. tabida, but also in facultative parasitism involving Drosophila simulans and in Aedes aegypti cells. In these latter cases, the expression of Wolbachia bacterioferritin was also increased in the presence of iron, showing that Wolbachia responds to the concentration of iron. Our results indicate that Wolbachia may generally interfere with iron metabolism. The high affinity of Wolbachia for iron might be due to physiological requirement of the bacterium, but it could also be what allows the symbiont to persist in the organism by reducing the labile iron concentration, thus protecting the cell from oxidative stress and apoptosis. These findings also reinforce the idea that pathogenic, parasitic and mutualistic intracellular bacteria all use the same molecular mechanisms to survive and replicate within host cells. By impacting the general physiology of the host, the presence of a symbiont may select for host compensatory mechanisms, which extends the possible consequences of persistent endosymbiont on the evolution of their hosts.",M2
19845635,"The natural genetic engineering of polydnaviruses.The polydnaviruses represent an unusual example of a highly evolved symbiosis between some parasitic <e>wasps</e>, DNA containing particles or viruses, and lepidopteran larval hosts of the wasp. The viruses can no longer replicate independently, as genes that encode viral structural proteins are restricted to the wasp genome and are not encapsidated. Interestingly, the DNA that is encapsidated is more similar in terms of gene identity and gene density to eukaryotic genomes than viral genomes. We compare and relate this unusual example of natural genetic engineering to the well-known system of viral lysogeny. The similarities in the two systems may prove useful in understanding the replication strategy and genomic organization of polydnaviruses and provide some insight into how this unusual virus system may have evolved.",M2
19838432,"Efficacy analysis of methylprednisolone plus adrenaline to treat <e>wasp</e> sting injury.OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of methylprednisolone (MP) plus adrenaline to treat patients injured by wasp stings. METHODS: This study was carried out at The First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, Hubei Province, China, from June to November 2008. A total of 45 cases were divided into 2 groups. The MP was used alone in the control group, and MP plus adrenaline was used in the observation group. We compared the clinical effect between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (64.05 +/- 59.31 versus 124.14 +/- 80.01 U/L), and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CKMB) (90.32 +/- 85.19 versus 216.68 +/- 277.58 umol/L) levels of the observation group were significantly lower than those of the control group. The length of hospital stay of the observation group was significantly shorter than that of the control group (7.23 +/- 2.93 versus 11.23 +/- 8.02), while complications from the wasp sting were fewer than those of the control group. In addition, the level of peripheral blood leukocytes was positively correlated with the number of stings (r=0.733, p=0.001), levels of ALT and CKMB (r=0.627, p=0.001, and r=0.705, p=0.001), and length of hospital stay (r=0.667, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Allergic and inflammatory responses play an important role in addition to the direct effect of wasp venom on the human body. Compared with MP alone, early combination of adrenaline helps to further inhibit the diffusion of allergy and inflammatory cytokines, and therefore reduce the severity of injury.",M2
19837078,"Identification, cloning and expression of a second gene (vpr1) from the venom of the endoparasitic <e>wasp</e>, Pimpla hypochondriaca that displays immunosuppressive activity.Previously, we biochemically isolated an immunosuppressive protein (VPr3) from the venom of Pimpla hypochondriaca and cloned and expressed the gene in bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence for VPr3 shares 63% identity with a second P. hypochondriaca protein, venom protein one (VPr1). We have now cloned and expressed the gene for vpr1. The expression of His-tagged recombinant VPr1 (rVPr1) in E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells was induced by the addition of 0.5mM IPTG. Cultures were grown at 24 and 37 degrees C, and VPr1 more readily partitioned into the soluble fraction at 24 degrees C. Soluble rVPr1 was purified using the MagneHis purification system and a modified elution buffer to allow the protein to be directly tested for activity against haemocytes. It was observed that rVPr1 prevented the ability of haemocytes to spread and form aggregates in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, comparable levels of activity were observed when similar concentrations of rVPr1 and rVPr3 were tested. In addition, the encapsulation of Sephadex beads in vivo was reduced by the presence of rVPr1 and beads were unencapsulated (negative) or only weakly encapsulated. The functional and physio-chemical properties of rVPr1 and rVPr3 are compared and discussed.",M2
19835981,"Antennal courtship and functional morphology of tyloids in the parasitoid <e>wasp</e> Syrphoctonus tarsatorius (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae: Diplazontinae).Courtship behaviour and associated morphological characters are believed to evolve under diversifying sexual selection. In Hymenoptera, sexually dimorphic antennal structures, the 'tyloids', show a large variability. Although crucial for functional interpretation, the link between tyloid morphology and courtship behaviour has gained only limited attention. Here, we investigate antennal morphology and antennal courtship in the parasitoid wasp Syrphoctonus tarsatorius (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae: Diplazontinae). We confirm the glandular nature of the tyloids by light and scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, we report a new form of antennation during courtship, antennal double-coiling, which links morphology and behaviour by bringing the tyloids in direct contact with the antennae of the female, thus probably facilitating the transfer of a contact pheromone. We show that a change in haemolymph pressure is the activator of the antennal movement and that it can be reproduced in the laboratory using amputated antennae. Investigations of antennal structure and movement in three additional hymenopteran species suggest that the number and location of tyloids coincide with the modality of antennal coiling. Our method for simulating antennal movement will enable retrieving information about courtship behaviour from museum specimens, thus leading to a better understanding of the evolution of courtship behaviour in Hymenoptera.",M2
19822002,"Cyto-nuclear discordance in the phylogeny of Ficus section Galoglychia and host shifts in plant-pollinator associations.BACKGROUND: Hybridization events are relatively common in vascular plants. However, the frequency of these events is unevenly distributed across the plant phylogeny. Plant families in which individual species are pollinated by specific pollinator species are predicted to be less prone to hybridization than other families. However, exceptions may occur within these families, when pollinators shift host-plant species. Indeed, host shifts are expected to increase the rate of hybridization events. Pollinators of Ficus section Galoglychia are suspected to have changed host repeatedly, based on several cases of incongruence between plant phylogeny and taxonomy, and insect phylogeny and taxonomy. We tracked cyto-nuclear discordance across section Galoglychia as evidence for hybridization. To achieve a proper global view, we first clarified the monophyly of section Galoglychia as it had been questioned by recent phylogenetic studies. Moreover, we investigated if fig size could be a factor facilitating host shifts. RESULTS: Phylogenetic chloroplast and nuclear results demonstrated the monophyly of section Galoglychia. Within section Galoglychia, we detected several cases of statistically significant cyto-nuclear discordance. Discordances concern both terminal nodes of the phylogenetic trees and one deep node defining relationships between subsections. Because nuclear phylogeny is congruent with morphological taxonomy, discordances were caused by the chloroplast phylogeny. Introgressive hybridization was the most likely explanation for these discordances. We also detected that subsections pollinated by several <e>wasp</e> genera had smaller figs and were pollinated by smaller wasps than subsections pollinated by a single wasp genus. CONCLUSION: As hypothesized, we discovered evidences of past hybridization in Ficus section Galoglychia. Further, introgression was only detected in subsections presenting incongruence between plant and pollinator phylogenies and taxonomy. This supports the hypothesis that host shift is the cause for plant-pollinator incongruence. Moreover, small fig size could facilitate host shifts. Eventually, this study demonstrates that non-coding chloroplast markers are valuable to resolve deep nodes in Ficus phylogeny.",M2
19812617,"Population dynamics and rapid spread of Cardinium, a bacterial endosymbiont causing cytoplasmic incompatibility in Encarsia pergandiella (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae).Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is a common phenotype of maternally inherited bacterial symbionts of arthropods; in its simplest expression, uninfected females produce few or no viable progeny when mated to infected males. Infected females thus experience a reproductive advantage relative to that of uninfected females, with the potential for the symbiont to spread rapidly. CI population dynamics are predicted to depend primarily on the strength of incompatibility, the fitness cost of the infection and how faithfully symbionts are inherited. Although the bacterial symbiont lineage Wolbachia has been most identified with the CI phenotype, an unrelated bacterium, Cardinium may also cause CI. In the first examination of population dynamics of CI-inducing Cardinium, we used population cages of the parasitic <e>wasp</e> Encarsia pergandiella (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) with varying initial infection frequencies to test a model of invasion. Cardinium was found to spread rapidly in all populations, even in cases where the initial infection frequency was well below the predicted invasion threshold frequency. The discrepancy between the modeled and actual results is best explained by weaker CI than measured in the lab and a cryptic fitness benefit to the infection.",M2
19805426,"Social stability and helping in small animal societies.In primitively eusocial societies, all individuals can potentially reproduce independently. The key fact that we focus on in this paper is that individuals in such societies instead often queue to inherit breeding positions. Queuing leads to systematic differences in expected future fitness. We first discuss the implications this has for variation in behaviour. For example, because helpers nearer to the front of the queue have more to lose, they should work less hard to rear the dominant's offspring. However, higher rankers may be more aggressive than low rankers, even if they risk injury in the process, if aggression functions to maintain or enhance queue position. Second, we discuss how queuing rules may be enforced through hidden threats that rarely have to be carried out. In fishes, rule breakers face the threat of eviction from the group. In contrast, subordinate paper <e>wasps</e> are not injured or evicted during escalated challenges against the dominant, perhaps because they are more valuable to the dominant. We discuss evidence that paper-wasp dominants avoid escalated conflicts by ceding reproduction to subordinates. Queuing rules appear usually to be enforced by individuals adjacent in the queue rather than by dominants. Further manipulative studies are required to reveal mechanisms underlying queue stability and to elucidate what determines queue position in the first place.",M2
19801954,"Acute compartment syndrome of the hand after a <e>wasp</e> sting: a case report.Compartment syndrome of the hand is an uncommon entity in children and is usually the result of trauma or burns. Insects, such as wasps, produce a wide variety of toxins such as amines, peptides, and enzymes that can cause local and systemic inflammatory reactions after a sting. This inflammation can, in rare cases, lead to the development of a compartment syndrome. We present the case of a 5-year-old boy who developed a compartment syndrome of the hand after a single wasp sting that required emergent fasciotomy. To our knowledge, this has not been reported previously in the literature. An institutional review board approved review of the case. The clinical presentation, laboratory studies, radiographs, and possible-exacerbating factors leading to the development of a compartment syndrome, as well as the surgical procedure and postoperative course, were reviewed. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative photographs are also presented. A 5-year-old boy presented to the emergency department 18 h after a single wasp sting to the dorsum of his hand. Based on his history and physical examination, hand compartment pressures were measured in his hand and found to be elevated. He underwent emergent fasciotomies with delayed wound closure. The patient healed uneventfully and at 5-month follow-up had full use of his hand, full range of motion, and normal 2-point discrimination in all the fingers. In conclusion, while wasp and other insect stings are common in children, this case is the first, to our knowledge, of a compartment syndrome of the hand after a wasp sting. Local measures used to treat insect stings such as heat and elevation may have played a role in the development of a compartment syndrome. It is important to have a high index of suspicion for this condition in a patient who presents with signs and symptoms of a compartment syndrome after an insect sting. Level of evidence: IV.",M2
19798479,"Colour mimicry and sexual deception by Tongue orchids (Cryptostylis).Typically, floral colour attracts pollinators by advertising rewards such as nectar, but how does colour function when pollinators are deceived, unrewarded, and may even suffer fitness costs? Sexually deceptive orchids are pollinated only by male insects fooled into mating with orchid flowers and inadvertently transferring orchid pollinia. Over long distances, sexually deceptive orchids lure pollinators with counterfeit insect sex pheromones, but close-range deception with colour mimicry is a tantalising possibility. Here, for the first time, we analyse the colours of four sexually deceptive Cryptostylis orchid species and the female <e>wasp</e> they mimic (Lissopimpla excelsa, Ichneumonidae), from the perspective of the orchids' single, shared pollinator, male Lissopimpla excelsa. Despite appearing different to humans, the colours of the orchids and female wasps were effectively identical when mapped into a hymenopteran hexagonal colour space. The orchids and wasps reflected predominantly red-orange wavelengths, but UV was also reflected by raised bumps on two orchid species and by female wasp wings. The orchids' bright yellow pollinia contrasted significantly with their overall red colour. Orchid deception may therefore involve accurate and species-specific mimicry of wavelengths reflected by female wasps, and potentially, exploitation of insects' innate attraction to UV and yellow wavelengths. In general, mimicry may be facilitated by exploiting visual vulnerabilities and evolve more readily at the peripheries of sensory perception. Many sexually deceptive orchids are predominantly red, green or white: colours that are all potentially difficult for hymenoptera to detect or distinguish from the background.",M2
19781547,"A nutritional profile of the social <e>wasp</e> Polistes metricus: differences in nutrient levels between castes and changes within castes during the annual life cycle.In wasps, nutrition plays a vital role for colony cohesion and caste determination. However, there is no baseline data set for the nutritional levels of wasps during the different stages of the colony cycle. Here we examined the levels of carbohydrates, lipids, protein, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, and Zn in the wasp Polistes metricus at different stages of the wasp's lifecycle. Individuals were collected at the following stages (1) spring gynes, (2) foundress colonies, (3) early worker colonies, (4) late worker colonies, (5) emerging reproductives (gynes and males), (6) early fall reproductives, and (7) late fall reproductives. All eggs, larvae, pupae and adults were analyzed for their nutritional content to determine if there were any differences between the nutrient levels in the different castes and how these nutrients changed within a caste during its lifetime. The results show there are differences in macro and micronutrient levels between the reproductive females and workers during development. Gynes showed changes in nutrient levels during their lifetime especially as they changed roles from a solitary individual to a nesting queen. Males also showed distinct nutritional changes during their lifetime. The implications for these nutritional differences are discussed.",M2
19779759,"Strong attraction of the parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris towards minor volatile compounds of maize.Plants infested with herbivorous arthropods emit complex blends of volatile compounds, which are used by several natural enemies as foraging cues. Despite detailed knowledge on the composition and amount of the emitted volatiles in many plant-herbivore systems, it remains largely unknown which compounds are essential for the attraction of natural enemies. In this study, we used a combination of different fractionation methods and olfactometer bioassays in order to examine the attractiveness of different compositions of volatile blends to females of the parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris. In a first step, we passed a volatile blend emitted by Spodoptera littoralis infested maize seedlings over a silica-containing filter tube and subsequently desorbed the volatiles that were retained by the silica filter (silica extract). The volatiles that broke through the silica filter were collected on and subsequently desorbed from a SuperQ filter (breakthrough). The silica extract was highly attractive to the <e>wasps</e>, whereas the breakthrough volatiles were not attractive. The silica extract was even more attractive than the extract that contained all herbivore-induced maize volatiles. Subsequently, we fractioned the silica extract by preparative gas-chromatography (GC) and by separating more polar from less polar compounds. In general, C. marginiventris preferred polar over non-polar compounds, but several fractions were attractive to the wasp, including one that contained compounds emitted in quantities below the detection threshold of the GC analysis. These results imply that the attractiveness of the volatile blend emitted by Spodoptera-infested maize seedlings to C. marginiventris females is determined by a specific combination of attractive and repellent/masking compounds, including some that are emitted in very small amounts. Manipulating the emission of such minor compounds has the potential to greatly improve the attraction of certain parasitoids and enhance biological control of specific insect pests.",M2

We conducted a comparative study of the venom apparatuses from three Asobara spp.: the European Asobara tabida, the Asiatic A. japonica and the African A. citri.

19773069,"Virulence factors and strategies of Leptopilina spp.: selective responses in Drosophila hosts.To ensure survival, parasitic <e>wasps</e> of Drosophila have evolved strategies to optimize host development to their advantage. They also produce virulence factors that allow them to overcome or evade host defense. Wasp infection provokes cellular and humoral defense reactions, resulting in alteration in gene expression of the host. The activation of these reactions is controlled by conserved mechanisms shared by other invertebrate and vertebrate animals. Application of genomics and bioinformatics approaches is beginning to reveal comparative host gene expression changes after infection by different parasitic wasps. We analyze this comparison in the context of host physiology and immune cells, as well as the biology of the venom factors that wasps introduce into their hosts during oviposition. We compare virulence strategies of Leptopilina boulardi and L. heterotoma, in relation to genome-wide changes in gene expression in the fly hosts after infection. This analysis highlights fundamental differences in the changes that the host undergoes in its immune and general physiology in response to the two parasitic wasps. Such a comparative approach has the potential of revealing mechanisms governing the evolution of pathogenicity and how it impacts host range.",M2
19769980,"Deadly venom of Asobara japonica parasitoid needs ovarian antidote to regulate host physiology.Asobara japonica (Braconidae) is an endophagous parasitoid developing in Drosophila larvae. The present study shows that A. japonica was never encapsulated in Drosophila melanogaster, and that it caused an overall inhibition of the host encapsulation reaction since injected foreign bodies were never encapsulated in parasitized hosts. Both the number of circulating hemocytes and the phenoloxidase activity decreased in parasitized larvae, and the hematopoietic organ appeared highly disrupted. We also found that A. japonica venom secretions had atypical effects on hosts compared to other braconid <e>wasps</e>. A. japonica venom secretions induced permanent paralysis followed by death of D. melanogaster larvae, whether injected by the female wasp during an interrupted oviposition, or manually injected into unparasitized larvae. More remarkably, these effects could be reversed by injection of ovarian extracts from female wasps. This is the first report that the venom of an endophagous braconid parasitoid can have a deadly effect on hosts, and moreover, that ovarian extracts can act as an antidote to reverse the effects of the wasp's venom. These results also demonstrate that A. japonica secretions from both venom gland and ovary are required to regulate synergistically the host physiology for the success of the parasitoid.",M2
19769240,"A study of <e>wasp</e> bites in a tertiary hospital of western Nepal.Hymenopterid stings and subsequent allergic reactions including fatal anaphylaxis are common indications for emergency department visits worldwide.

Eleven cases (all male, age 35.5 +/- 15.2 years) of wasp bites admitted in the Manipal Teaching Hospital (MTH), Pokhara during 01st February, 2006 to 30th October, 2007 were enrolled in this study. Mean wasp bites number was 48.7 +/- 7.1 (11-100) and mean time to reach the hospital from the bite time was 69.1 +/- 149.7 hours (1.5 h-12 days). Nine patients developed acute renal failure (ARF) and secondary hypertension. Eight patients underwent hemodialysis. Two patients stuck by more than 75 stings developed refractory pulmonary edema and died in the course of treatment.

The proposed method was adapted from Wille (1962) who used an attractive solution based on water and honey for bee attraction.

19756461,"'Special agents' trigger social waves in giant honeybees (Apis dorsata).Giant honeybees (Apis dorsata) nest in the open and have therefore evolved a variety of defence strategies. Against predatory <e>wasps</e>, they produce highly coordinated Mexican wavelike cascades termed 'shimmering', whereby hundreds of bees flip their abdomens upwards. Although it is well known that shimmering commences at distinct spots on the nest surface, it is still unclear how shimmering is generated. In this study, colonies were exposed to living tethered wasps that were moved in front of the experimental nest. Temporal and spatial patterns of shimmering were investigated in and after the presence of the wasp. The numbers and locations of bees that participated in the shimmering were assessed, and those bees that triggered the waves were identified. The findings reveal that the position of identified trigger cohorts did not reflect the experimental path of the tethered wasp. Instead, the trigger centres were primarily arranged in the close periphery of the mouth zone of the nest, around those parts where the main locomotory activity occurs. This favours the 'special-agents' hypothesis that suggest that groups of specialized bees initiate the shimmering.",M2
19751736,"Endocrine mediated phenotypic plasticity: condition-dependent effects of juvenile hormone on dominance and fertility of <e>wasp</e> queens.There has been increasing interest in the mechanisms that mediate behavioral and physiological plasticity across individuals with similar genotypes. Some of the most dramatic plasticity is found within and between social insect castes. For example, Polistes wasp queens can nest alone, dominate a group of cooperative queens, or act as worker-like subordinates who rarely reproduce. Previous work suggests that condition-dependent endocrine responses may play a role in plasticity between castes in the hymenoptera. Here, we test whether condition-dependent endocrine responses influence plasticity within castes in the wasp Polistes dominulus. We experimentally manipulate juvenile hormone (JH) titers in nest-founding queens and assess whether JH mediates variation in behavior and physiology. JH generally increased dominance and fertility of queens, but JH's effects were not uniform across individuals. JH had a stronger effect on the dominance and fertility of large individuals and individuals with facial patterns advertising high quality than on the dominance and fertility of small individuals and those advertising low quality. These results demonstrate that JH has condition-dependent effects. As such, they clarify how JH can mediate different behaviors in well nourished queens and poorly nourished workers. Many Polistes queens nest cooperatively with other queens, so condition-dependent hormonal responses provide a mechanism for queens to adaptively allocate energy based on their probability of successfully becoming the dominant queen. Research on the endocrine basis of plasticity often focuses on variation in endocrine titers alone. However, differential endocrine responses are likely to be a widespread mechanism mediating behavioral and physiological plasticity.",M2
19744121,"Evolution of identity signals: frequency-dependent benefits of distinctive phenotypes used for individual recognition.Identifying broad-scale evolutionary processes that maintain phenotypic polymorphisms has been a major goal of modern evolutionary biology. There are numerous mechanisms, such as negative frequency-dependent selection, that may maintain polymorphisms, although it is unknown which mechanisms are prominent in nature. Traits used for individual recognition are strikingly variable and have evolved independently in numerous lineages, providing an excellent model to investigate which factors maintain ecologically relevant phenotypic polymorphisms. Theoretical models suggest that individuals may benefit by advertising their identities with distinctive, recognizable phenotypes. Here, we test the benefits of advertising one's identity with a distinctive phenotype. We manipulated the appearance of Polistes fuscatus paper <e>wasp</e> groups so that three individuals had the same appearance and one individual had a unique, easily recognizable appearance. We found that individuals with distinctive appearances received less aggression than individuals with nondistinctive appearances. Therefore, individuals benefit by advertising their identity with a unique phenotype. Our results provide a potential mechanism through which negative frequency-dependent selection may maintain the polymorphic identity signals in P. fuscatus. Given that recognition is important for many social interactions, selection for distinctive identity signals may be an underappreciated and widespread mechanism underlying the evolution of phenotypic polymorphisms in social taxa.",M2
19740887,"The origin of a selfish B chromosome triggering paternal sex ratio in the parasitoid <e>wasp</e> Trichogramma kaykai.This study uses molecular and cytogenetic methods to determine the origin of a B chromosome in some males of the wasp Trichogramma kaykai. This so-called paternal sex ratio (PSR) chromosome transmits only through sperm and shortly after fertilization triggers degeneration of the paternal genome, while keeping itself intact. The resulting embryos develop into haploid B-chromosome-carrying males. Another PSR chromosome with a very similar mode of action is found in the distantly related wasp Nasonia vitripennis and its origin was traced by transposon similarity to the genus Trichomalopsis, which is closely related to Nasonia. To determine whether both PSR chromosomes have a similar origin we aimed to reveal the origin of the Trichogramma PSR chromosome. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we discovered a major satellite repeat on the PSR chromosome, the 45S ribosomal DNA. Analysis of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of this repeat showed the presence of multiple ITS2 sequences on the PSR chromosome resembling either the ITS2 of T. oleae or of T. kaykai. We therefore conclude that the Trichogramma PSR chromosome originates from T. oleae or a T. oleae-like species. Our results are consistent with different origins for the PSR chromosomes in Trichogramma and Nasonia.",M2
19720157,"Evolution of specialized spermatheca morphology in ant queens: insight from comparative developmental biology between ants and polistine <e>wasps</e>.In many ant species, the queens can keep spermatozoa alive in their spermatheca for several years, which goes along with unique morphological characteristics of the queen's spermatheca. The relative spermatheca size in ant queens is prominently larger than that in social wasps. Furthermore, the epithelium lining the spermatheca reservoir of ants consists of columnar cells in the hilar region and squamous cells in the distal region, whereas it is formed by columnar cells only in social wasps. To study the evolution of the unique spermatheca morphology in ant queens, we compared the various processes during spermatheca development between two ponerine ant species of the genus Pachycondyla (=Brachyponera) and three polistine wasp species of the genus Polistes. From histological observations, we can define four developmental events in the ant queens: (1) invagination of the spermatheca primordium, (2) the reservoir wall thickness becomes unequal, (3) the reservoir diameter doubles as the lining epithelial cells become flattened except for the hilar region, and (4) the increase in thickness of the reservoir epithelium is limited to the hilar region which doubles in thickness. In polistine wasps, the second and the third developmental events are absent and the entire epithelium of the spermatheca wall becomes thick in the final step. We therefore conclude that for ant queens the second and third steps are crucial for the enlargement of the spermatheca size, and that the second to the fourth steps are crucial for the specialization of the reservoir wall structure.",M2
19716363,"Bradykinin-related peptides in the venom of the solitary <e>wasp</e> Cyphononyx fulvognathus.Bradykinin (BK) and its related peptides are widely distributed in venomous animals, including wasps. In fact, we have previously purified a novel BK-related peptide (BRP) named Cd-146 and the threonine(6)-bradykinin (Thr(6)-BK) from the venom of the solitary wasp Cyphononyx fulvognathus. Further survey of this same wasp venom extract allowed the structural characterization of two other novel BRPs, named here as fulvonin and cyphokinin. Biochemical characterization performed here showed that although the high primary structure similarity observed with BK, these wasp peptides are not good substrates for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) acting more likely as inhibitors of this enzyme. In pharmacological assays, only those more structurally similar to BK, namely cyphokinin and Thr(6)-BK, were able to promote the contraction of guinea-pig ileum smooth muscle preparations, which was completely blocked by the B(2) receptors antagonist HOE-140 in the same way as observed for BK. Only fulvonin was shown to potentiate BK-elicited smooth muscle contraction. Moreover, the 2 new wasp BRPs, namely fulvonin and cyphokinin, as well as Cd-146 and Thr(6)-BK, showed hyperalgesic effect in the rat paw pressure test after intraplantar injection. This effect was shown here to be due to the action of these peptides on BK receptors, since the hyperalgesia induced by both Cd-146 and fulvonin was blocked by B(1) receptor antagonist, while the effect of both cyphokinin and Thr(6)-BK was reversed by B(2) antagonist. This data give support to a better understanding of the function and targets of the kinin-related peptides widely found in several insect venoms.",M2
19707266,"Host niches and defensive extended phenotypes structure parasitoid <e>wasp</e> communities.Oak galls are spectacular extended phenotypes of gallwasp genes in host oak tissues and have evolved complex morphologies that serve, in part, to exclude parasitoid natural enemies.Parasitoids and their insect herbivore hosts have coevolved to produce diverse communities comprising about a third of all animal species. The factors structuring these communities, however, remain poorly understood. An emerging theme in community ecology is the need to consider the effects of host traits, shaped by both natural selection and phylogenetic history, on associated communities of natural enemies. Here we examine the impact of host traits and phylogenetic relatedness on 48 ecologically closed and species-rich communities of parasitoids attacking gall-inducing wasps on oaks. Gallwasps induce the development of spectacular and structurally complex galls whose species- and generation-specific morphologies are the extended phenotypes of gallwasp genes. All the associated natural enemies attack their concealed hosts through gall tissues, and several structural gall traits have been shown to enhance defence against parasitoid attack. Here we explore the significance of these and other host traits in predicting variation in parasitoid community structure across gallwasp species. In particular, we test the  Enemy Hypothesis,  which predicts that galls with similar morphology will exclude similar sets of parasitoids and therefore have similar parasitoid communities. Having controlled for phylogenetic patterning in host traits and communities, we found significant correlations between parasitoid community structure and several gall structural traits (toughness, hairiness, stickiness), supporting the Enemy Hypothesis. Parasitoid community structure was also consistently predicted by components of the hosts' spatiotemporal niche, particularly host oak taxonomy and gall location (e.g., leaf versus bud versus seed). The combined explanatory power of structural and spatiotemporal traits on community structure can be high, reaching 62% in one analysis. The observed patterns derive mainly from partial niche specialisation of highly generalist parasitoids with broad host ranges (&gt;20 hosts), rather than strict separation of enemies with narrower host ranges, and so may contribute to maintenance of the richness of generalist parasitoids in gallwasp communities. Though evolutionary escape from parasitoids might most effectively be achieved via changes in host oak taxon, extreme conservatism in this trait for gallwasps suggests that selection is more likely to have acted on gall morphology and location. Any escape from parasitoids associated with evolutionary shifts in these traits has probably only been transient, however, due to subsequent recruitment of parasitoid species already attacking other host galls with similar trait combinations.",M2
19696350,"Bacteriophages encode factors required for protection in a symbiotic mutualism.Bacteriophages are known to carry key virulence factors for pathogenic bacteria, but their roles in symbiotic bacteria are less well understood. The heritable symbiont Hamiltonella defensa protects the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum from attack by the parasitoid Aphidius ervi by killing developing <e>wasp</e> larvae. In a controlled genetic background, we show that a toxin-encoding bacteriophage is required to produce the protective phenotype. Phage loss occurs repeatedly in laboratory-held H. defensa-infected aphid clonal lines, resulting in increased susceptibility to parasitism in each instance. Our results show that these mobile genetic elements can endow a bacterial symbiont with benefits that extend to the animal host. Thus, phages vector ecologically important traits, such as defense against parasitoids, within and among symbiont and animal host lineages.",M2

19682456,"A new rod-shaped virus from parasitic <e>wasp</e> Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Hymenoptera: Braconidae).A new rod-shaped nucleocapsids (NCs) was found inadvertently in Diachasmimorpha longicaudata accessory gland filaments (AGFs). The NCs were 30 nm in diameter and nearly 900 nm in length. They replicated in a small cell type of the AGFs in D. longicaudata, and following oviposition, invaded and proliferated in the hemocytes of a parasitized host Bactrocera dorsalis Hendel. This finding of a completely new virus in the AGF indicate that different geographical populations (subspecies) of D. longicaudata may carry different sybionts. This is the first report showing that the same wasp species, but from a different geographical populations, can carry an entirely different virus.",M2
19659591,"Effects of parthenogenesis and geographic isolation on female sexual traits in a parasitoid <e>wasp</e>.Population divergence in sexual traits is affected by different selection pressures, depending on the mode of reproduction. In allopatric sexual populations, aspects of sexual behavior may diverge due to sexual selection. In parthenogenetic populations, loss-of-function mutations in genes involved in sexual functionality may be selectively neutral or favored by selection. We assess to what extent these processes have contributed to divergence in female sexual traits in the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina clavipes in which some populations are infected with parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia bacteria. We find evidence consistent with both hypotheses. Both arrhenotokous males and males derived from thelytokous strains preferred to court females from their own population. This suggests that these populations had already evolved population-specific mating preferences when the latter became parthenogenetic. Thelytokous females did not store sperm efficiently and fertilized very few of their eggs. The nonfertility of thelytokous females was due to mutations in the wasp genome, which must be an effect of mutation accumulation under thelytoky. Divergence in female sexual traits of these two allopatric populations has thus been molded by different forces: independent male/female coevolution while both populations were still sexual, followed by female-only evolution after one population switched to parthenogenesis.",M2
19645280,"Reducing honey bee defensive responses and social <e>wasp</e> colonization with methyl anthranilate.Human victims of a massive number of stings have been steadily increasing since the invasion of Africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera) to the United States in 1990. Multiple honey bee stings may result in venom toxicity, leading to renal failure and even death. Here we tested the efficacy of methyl anthranilate as a honey bee repellent during a massive defensive response by Africanized honey bees. An aerosolized solution of 10% methyl anthranilate reduced the number of defensive bee hits to a retreating victim by 95% compared with a water control. One hundred fifty milliliters of the 10% methyl anthranilate solution sprayed onto stationary foam balls covered with black suede leather located 2 m from provoked Africanized colonies received 80% fewer stings than targets treated with water. Methyl anthranilate (100%) delivered through a UV blocking 3 mil polyethylene pouch was 100% effective in preventing Polistes colonization in wildlife observation huts and from the roof overhang of home patios. Although methyl anthranilate was not 100% effective in preventing honey bee stinging, it seemed to reduce number of stings below the average human LD50, indicative of a promising tool for preventing honey bee venom toxicity and wasp colonization.",M2
19641625,"Characterization of a lamellocyte transcriptional enhancer located within the misshapen gene of Drosophila melanogaster.Drosophila has emerged as an excellent model system in which to study cellular and genetic aspects of hematopoiesis. Under normal developmental conditions and in wild-type genetic backgrounds, Drosophila possesses two types of blood cells, crystal cells and plasmatocytes. Upon infestation by a parasitic <e>wasp</e> or in certain altered genetic backgrounds, a third hemocyte class called the lamellocyte becomes apparent. Herein we describe the characterization of a novel transcriptional regulatory module, a lamellocyte-active enhancer of the misshapen gene. This transcriptional control sequence appears to be inactive in all cell types of the wild-type larva, including crystal cells and plasmatocytes. However, in lamellocytes induced by wasp infestation or by particular genetic conditions, the enhancer is activated and it directs reporter GFP or DsRed expression exclusively in lamellocytes. The lamellocyte control region was delimited to a 140-bp intronic sequence that contains an essential DNA recognition element for the AP-1 transcription factor. Additionally, mutation of the kayak gene encoding the dFos subunit of AP-1 led to a strong suppression of lamellocyte production in tumorous larvae. As misshapen encodes a protein kinase within the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway that functions to form an active AP-1 complex, the lamellocyte-active enhancer likely serves as a transcriptional target within a genetic auto-regulatory circuit that promotes the production of lamellocytes in immune-challenged or genetically-compromised animals.",M2
19625616,"Life history plasticity magnifies the ecological effects of a social <e>wasp</e> invasion.An unresolved question in ecology concerns why the ecological effects of invasions vary in magnitude. Many introduced species fail to interact strongly with the recipient biota, whereas others profoundly disrupt the ecosystems they invade through predation, competition, and other mechanisms. In the context of ecological impacts, research on biological invasions seldom considers phenotypic or microevolutionary changes that occur following introduction. Here, we show how plasticity in key life history traits (colony size and longevity), together with omnivory, magnifies the predatory impacts of an invasive social wasp (Vespula pensylvanica) on a largely endemic arthropod fauna in Hawaii. Using a combination of molecular, experimental, and behavioral approaches, we demonstrate (i) that yellowjackets consume an astonishing diversity of arthropod resources and depress prey populations in invaded Hawaiian ecosystems and (ii) that their impact as predators in this region increases when they shift from small annual colonies to large perennial colonies. Such trait plasticity may influence invasion success and the degree of disruption that invaded ecosystems experience. Moreover, postintroduction phenotypic changes may help invaders to compensate for reductions in adaptive potential resulting from founder events and small population sizes. The dynamic nature of biological invasions necessitates a more quantitative understanding of how postintroduction changes in invader traits affect invasion processes.",M2

Andesipolis yanayacu was reared as a gregarious koinobiont parasitoid of shelter building Pyralidae (Lepidoptera) larvae feeding on Urticaceae (Phenax rugosus and Boehmeria bullata). These are the first biological observations for the genus Andesipolis and the first species recorded from Ecuador.

19618060,"[Effects of irrigation, environmental variability and predatory <e>wasp</e> on Leucoptera coffeella (Guérin-Méneville) (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae), in coffee plants]The population density of the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella (Guérin-Méneville) can be affected by environmental variables in irrigated agroecosystems and the occurrence of predatory wasps such as Vespidae. In here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of environmental variables, drip irrigation depths and predation by wasps on the population density of L. coffeella. The experiment was carried out during 2004 and 2005 in a Coffea arabica plantation cultivated in the county of Jaboticatubas, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The different irrigation depths set through drip were established considering the daily depth required by the IRRIPLUS program, which was equal to 100%, and two other lower (51% and 72%) and higher (124% and 145%) values, having the control without irrigation. In order to evaluate the coffee leaf miner population density and predation, the number of active and preyed mines was determined on the fourth pair of leaves in a group of ten plants. For the study of interactions among the environmental variables, irrigation depths with the mine density of L. coffeella and predatory wasps, the following methods were used: multivariated analysis, simple linear regression and trail. We concluded that higher pluvial precipitation, solar radiation and irrigation depths would reduce population density of the coffee leaf miner. Furthermore, the increase in density of the predatory wasps was dependent on the population level of L. coffeella.",M2

19611262,"Initiation of absconding-swarm emigration in the social <e>wasp</e> Polybia occidentalis.When a colony of the swarm-founding social wasp Polybia occidentals loses its nest to severe weather or predation, the adult population evacuates and temporarily clusters on nearby foliage. Most of the adults remain inactive in the cluster, while foragers bring in nectar and scout wasps search the surrounding area for a new nesting site. After several hours, the scouts stimulate the rest of the swarm to leave the cluster and follow their pheromone trail to the chosen site. How scouts communicate to their swarm-mates that a site has been chosen and how they induce the swarm to depart are unknown. Video records of six Costa Rican swarms were used to quantitatively document changes in the frequencies of social behaviors leading to swarm departure. This was accomplished by going backward through the video record and following the behavior of individuals prior to their departure. Analysis of the behavior of scouts and inactive wasps indicated an increase in the frequency with which scouts bump into inactive wasps prior to swarm departure, as well as a shift in the behavior of inactive wasps from primarily receiving bumps to bumping others before departure. Thus, bumping is propagated by recently activated individuals before they take off. These observations suggest that not only is bumping an activation stimulus that causes swarm members to depart for the new nest site, but it is contagious, leading to its amplification throughout the swarm.",M2
19602298,"Study on mating ecology and sex ratio of three internally ovipositing fig <e>wasps</e> of Ficus curtipes.Studies on mating ecology and sex allocation in fig-parasitizing wasps ovipositing from outside the fig have given valuable insights into known factors that are responsible for the theory of sex ratio. Similarly, internally ovipositing fig-parasitizing wasps and fig-pollinating wasps provide interesting models for comparative analysis. In addition to the fig-pollinating wasp Eupristina sp., we found that Ficus curtipes hosts two species of internally ovipositing fig-parasitizing wasps: D. yangi and Lipothymus sp. Eupristina sp. males showed less aggression. Eupristina sp. has wingless males that mate only within the natal patch, providing excellent examples of full local-mate competition. D. yangi males showed high levels of aggression and lethal combat. D. yangi has winged males but mate mostly within the natal patch. Only a few matings occur after male dispersal. Its sex ratio was lower than the prediction of partial local mate competition theory. Wingless male Lipothymus sp., which mate partly after dispersal, did not present fatal fight. Therefore, the mating behaviour of D. yangi and Lipothymus sp. did not follow predicted patterns, based on wing morph. The mating pattern of D. yangi and Lipothymus sp. should follow the partial local mate competition theory. Furthermore, there was not a significant correlation between the proportion of males and the proportion of fruit parasitized in both winged D. yangi males and wingless Lipothymus sp. males.",M2
19588199,"Mate finding in the parasitic <e>wasp</e> Cephalonomia tarsalis (Ashmead): more than one way to a female's heart.The parasitic wasp, Cephalonomia tarsalis (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), parasitizes larvae of the sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), and is used for biological control of this worldwide pest of stored grain. To study the hypothesis that C. tarsalis not only mates at its natal patch but also uses olfactory cues to find mating partners elsewhere, we investigated semiochemical use by male C. tarsalis. Olfactometer experiments revealed that male C. tarsalis are arrested by odors emanating from the cocoons of conspecifics, from young unmated females, and from feces of the host. Dodecanal, which was identified from extracts of filter paper contaminated by young females, had an arresting effect on males but not on females and was, therefore, considered as a sex pheromone. These findings indicate that C. tarsalis is a species with partial local mate competition. Males mate with females: 1) at the emergence site following location of females by sex pheromones from their cocoons, and 2) after dispersal from the natal patch following location of females directly by dodecanal and indirectly by unidentified sexual kairomones from host feces.",M2
19561216,"A supracellular system of actin-lined canals controls biogenesis and release of virulence factors in parasitoid venom glands.Parasitoid <e>wasps</e> produce virulence factors that bear significant resemblance to viruses and have the ability to block host defense responses. The function of these virulence factors, produced predominantly in wasp venom glands, and the ways in which they interfere with host development and physiology remain mysterious. Here, we report the discovery of a specialized system of canals in venom glands of five parasitoid wasps that differ in their infection strategies. This supracellular canal system is made up of individual secretory units, one per secretory cell. Individual units merge into the canal lumen. The membrane surface of the proximal end of each canal within the secretory cell assumes brush border morphology, lined with bundles of F-actin. Systemic administration of cytochalasin D compromises the integrity of the secretory unit. We show a dynamic and continuous association of p40, a protein of virus-like particles from a Drosophila parasitoid, L. heterotoma, with the canal and venom gland lumen. Similar structures in three Leptopilina species and Ganaspis xanthopoda, parasitoids of Drosophila spp., and Campoletis sonorenesis, a parasitoid of Heliothis virescens, suggest that this novel supracellular canal system is likely to be a common trait of parasitoid venom glands that is essential for efficient biogenesis and delivery of virulence factors.",M2
19559708,"IkB genes encoded in Cotesia plutellae bracovirus suppress an antiviral response and enhance baculovirus pathogenicity against the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella.An endoparasitoid <e>wasp</e>, Cotesia plutellae, parasitizes larvae of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, with its symbiotic polydnavirus, C. plutellae bracovirus (CpBV). This study analyzed the role of Inhibitor-kB (IkB)-like genes encoded in CpBV in suppressing host antiviral response. Identified eight CpBV-IkBs are scattered on different viral genome segments and showed high homologies with other bracoviral IkBs in their amino acid sequences. Compared to an insect ortholog (e.g., Cactus of Drosophila melanogaster), they possessed a shorter ankyrin repeat domain without any regulatory domains. The eight CpBV-IkBs are, however, different in their promoter components and expression patterns in the parasitized host. To test their inhibitory activity on host antiviral response, a midgut response of P. xylostella against baculovirus infection was used as a model reaction. When the larvae were orally fed the virus, they exhibited melanotic responses of midgut epithelium, which increased with baculovirus dose and incubation time. Parasitized larvae exhibited a significant reduction in the midgut melanotic response, compared to nonparasitized larvae. Micro-injection of each of the four CpBV genome segments containing CpBV-IkBs into the hemocoel of nonparasitized larvae showed the gene expressions of the encoded IkBs and suppressed the midgut melanotic response in response to the baculovirus treatment. When nonparasitized larvae were orally administered with a recombinant baculovirus containing CpBV-IkB, they showed a significant reduction in midgut melanotic response and an enhanced susceptibility to the baculovirus infectivity.",M2
19554768,"Unsuccessful attacks dominate a drone-preying <e>wasp</e>'s hunting performance near stingless bee nests.Bee males (drones) of stingless bees tend to congregate near entrances of conspecific nests, where they wait for virgin queens that initiate their nuptial flight. We observed that the Neotropical solitary wasp Trachypus boharti (Hymenoptera, Cabronidae) specifically preys on males of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona postica (Hymenoptera, Apidae); these wasps captured up to 50 males per day near the entrance of a single hive. Over 90% of the wasp attacks were unsuccessful; such erroneous attacks often involved conspecific wasps and worker bees. After the capture of non-male prey, wasps almost immediately released these individuals unharmed and continued hunting. A simple behavioral experiment showed that at short distances wasps were not specifically attracted to S. postica males nor were they repelled by workers of the same species. Likely, short-range prey detection near the bees' nest is achieved mainly by vision whereas close-range prey recognition is based principally on chemical and/or mechanical cues. We argue that the dependence on the wasp's visual perception during attack and the crowded and dynamic hunting conditions caused wasps to make many preying attempts that failed. Two wasp-density-related factors, wasp-prey distance and wasp-wasp encounters, may account for the fact that the highest male capture and unsuccessful wasp bee encounter rates occurred at intermediate wasp numbers.",M2
19597320,"A technique of segment expression and RNA interference (SERI) reveals a specific physiological function of a cysteine-rich protein gene encoded in cotesia plutellae bracovirus.As a provirus, polydnavirus has a segmented DNA genome on chromosome(s) of host <e>wasp</e>. It contains several genes in each segment that presumably play critical roles in regulating physiological processes of target insect parasitized by the wasp. A cysteine-rich protein 1 (CRP1) is present in the polydnavirus Cotesia plutellae bracovirus (CpBV) genome, but its expression and physiological function in Plutella xylostella parasitized by the viral host C. plutellae is not known. This CpBV-CRP1 encoding 189 amino acids with a putative signal peptide (20 residues) was persistently expressed in parasitized P. xylostella with gradual decrease at the late parasitization period. Expression of CpBV-CRP1 was tissue-specific in the fat body/epidermis and hemocyte, but not in the gut. Its physiological function was analyzed by inducing transient expression of a CpBV segment containing CpBV-CRP1 and its promoter, which caused significant reduction in hemocyte -spreading and delayed larval development. When the treated larvae were co-injected with double-stranded RNA of CpBV-CRP1, the expression of CpBV-CRP1 disappeared,whereas other genes encoded in the CpBV segment was expressed. These co-injected larvae significantly recovered the hemocyte-spreading capacity and larval development rate. This study reports that CpBV-CRP1 is expressed in P.xylostella parasitized by C.plutellae and its physiological function is to alter the host immune and developmental processes.",M2
19594111,"<e>Wasp</e> mastoparans follow the same mechanism as the cell-penetrating peptide transportan 10.We have been examining the mechanism and kinetics of the interactions of a selected set of peptides with phospholipid membranes in a quantitative manner. This set was chosen to cover a broad range of physical-chemical properties and cell specificities. Mastoparan (masL) and mastoparan X (masX) are two similar peptides from the venoms of the wasps Vespula lewisii and Vespa xanthoptera, respectively, and were chosen to complete the set. The rate constants for masX association with and dissociation from membranes are reported here for the first time. The kinetics of dye efflux induced by both mastoparans from phospholipid vesicles were also examined and quantitatively analyzed. We find that masL and masX follow the same graded kinetic model that we previously proposed for the cell-penetrating peptide transportan 10 (tp10), but with different parameters. This comparison is relevant because tp10 is derived from masL by addition of a mostly nonpolar segment of seven residues at the N-terminus. Tp10 is more active than the mastoparans toward phosphatidylcholine vesicles, but the mastoparans are more sensitive to the effect of anionic lipids. Furthermore, the Gibbs free energies of binding and insertion of the peptides calculated using the Wimley-White transfer scales are in good agreement with the values derived from our experimental data and are useful for understanding peptide behavior.",M2
