11160396,"Regulation of neuregulin expression in the injured rat brain and cultured astrocytes.In this report, we investigated whether reactive astrocytes produce neuregulins (glial growth factor 2/<e>heregulin</e>/acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity or neu differentiation factor) and its putative receptors, ErbB2 and ErbB3 tyrosine kinases, in the injured CNS in vivo. Significant immunoreactivities with anti-neuregulin, anti-ErbB2, and anti-ErbB3 antibodies were detected on astrocytes at the injured site 4 d after injury to the adult rat cerebral cortex. To elucidate the mechanisms for the upregulation of neuregulin expression in astrocytes, primary cultured astrocytes were treated with certain reagents, including forskolin, that are known to elevate the intracellular level of cAMP and induce marked morphological changes in astrocytes. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of a 52 kDa membrane-spanning form of a neuregulin protein was enhanced in cultured astrocytes after administration of forskolin. The upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein was also observed in astrocytes treated with forskolin. In contrast, inactivation of protein kinase C because of chronic treatment with phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate downregulated the expression of the 52 kDa isoform, although other splice variants with apparent molecular sizes of 65 and 60 kDa were upregulated. These results suggest that the enhancement of neuregulin expression at injured sites is induced, at least in part, by elevation in intracellular cAMP levels and/or a protein kinase C signaling pathway. The neuregulin expressed on reactive astrocytes may stimulate their proliferation and support the survival of neurons surrounding cortical brain wounds in vivo.",M1
10376522,"NDF/<e>heregulin</e>-induced cell cycle changes and apoptosis in breast tumour cells: role of PI3 kinase and p38 MAP kinase pathways.Neu differentiation factor (NDF)/heregulin activates ErbB2 via heterodimerization with the NDF receptors ErbB3 and ErbB4. Cells which express normal levels of these receptors are often growth stimulated by NDF, whereas SKBR3, and other ErbB2-overexpressing breast tumour cells are growth inhibited. We demonstrate here that in SKBR3 cells, NDF induces G1 progression but also causes a G2 delay from day 1 and apoptosis from days 2-3. G1 progression was associated with ErbB2 transactivation of ErbB3 and subsequent stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway whereas apoptosis was dependent on p38 MAPK. Inhibition of ERK1/ERK2 had no effect on cell cycle progression or apoptosis. Activation of ErbB3 and PI3K was also seen with betacellulin (BTC) but not epidermal growth factor (EGF) and correlated with the growth effects of these ligands. All three ligands induced short-term activation of p38 MAPK in a c-Src-dependent manner. However, only NDF caused a second, c-Src-independent increase in p38 MAPK activity which was required for apoptosis.",M1
10226586,"Expression of P185erbB-2, P160erbB-3, P180erbB-4, and <e>heregulin</e> alpha in human normal bronchial epithelial and lung cancer cell lines.The receptors erbB-3 and erbB-4 are members of the type 1 tyrosine kinase receptor family which also comprises epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) and erbB-2. ErbB-3 and erbB-4 receptors are known to bind a family of related proteins termed heregulins. In this study, we report differential expression of P185erbB-2, P160erbB-3 and P180erbB-4, and their ligand heregulin alpha, in normal bronchial epithelial, and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines. Expression of P185erbB-2 and P160erbB-3 vary from very low to a high level in NSCLC cell lines and a low level in normal bronchial cells. In contrast, P180erbB-4 was detected only in NSCLC cell lines but not in normal bronchial cells. Heregulin alpha is expressed at intermediate levels in the normal and cancer cell lines studied. Immunoprecipitation, using antibodies to erbB-2, erbB-3 or erbB-4 receptors, coupled to phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis indicates that these three receptors are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in lung cancer cell lines, but only erbB-2 and erbB-3 are autophosphorylated in normal cells. These data suggest that constitutive activation of erbB-2, erbB-3 and erbB-4 receptors could be induced by heregulin alpha via an autocrine loop mechanism, and that the active forms of erbB-4 may cooperate with the other members of the EGF-receptor family in human lung carcinogenesis.",M1
10218974,"<e>Heregulins</e> or neu differentiation factors and the interactions between peritubular myoid cells and Sertoli cells.Interactions between (mesenchymal) peritubular myoid cells and (epithelial) Sertoli cells play an important role in the control of Sertoli cell function and spermatogenesis. The factors involved, however, have only partially been identified. Heregulins or neu differentiation factors (NDFs) mediate mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in a variety of tissues, but their role in the testis has not been investigated. Here we demonstrate that recombinant human heregulin-alpha (Her-alpha) and Her-beta stimulate transferrin and androgen-binding protein production by cultured rat Sertoli cells up to 2.5-fold. These effects are more pronounced than those of previously identified growth factors active in this assay, such as insulin-like growth factor I and basic fibroblast growth factor. Combination with these factors results in additive effects and in marked morphological changes in the Sertoli cell cultures, including formation of tubule-like structures. Stimulation of androgen-binding protein secretion is paralleled by increased levels of the corresponding messenger RNA. This parallelism was less consistent for transferrin. Semiquantitative RT-PCR indicates that the expression of NDF-alpha and NDF-beta is more pronounced in peritubular cells than in Leydig or Sertoli cells. Conversely, the main receptors for heregulins/NDFs, HER-3 and HER-4, are predominantly expressed in Sertoli cells. A displacement assay confirms the presence of high-affinity binding sites for [125I]Her-beta on intact Sertoli cells and reveals parallel displacement curves for Her-beta, Her-alpha, and concentrated peritubular cell-conditioned medium (PTCM; estimated ED50 values: 1 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, and 130 microg protein/ml, respectively), indicating that peritubular cells secrete one or more factors able to compete for heregulin receptors. It is concluded that heregulins/NDFs may play a role in mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in the testis. Estimates of the concentrations of heregulins in PTCM, however, make it unlikely that they contribute significantly to the effects observed with low concentrations of PTCM and ascribed to the putative mediator PModS (peritubular factor that modulates Sertoli cell function). Further investigations will be required to define the exact role of heregulins in the testis.",M1
10214951,"Binding specificities and affinities of egf domains for ErbB receptors.ErbB receptor activation is a complex process and is dependent upon the type and number of receptors expressed on a given cell. Previous studies with defined combinations of ErbB receptors expressed in mammalian cells have helped elucidate specific biological responses for many of the recognized gene products that serve as ligands for these receptors. However, no study has examined the binding of these ligands in a defined experimental system. To address this issue, the relative binding affinities of the egf domains of eleven ErbB ligands were measured on six ErbB receptor combinations using a soluble receptor-ligand binding format. The ErbB2/4 heterodimer was shown to bind all ligands tested with moderate to very high affinity. In contrast, ErbB3 showed much more restrictive ligand binding specificity and measurable binding was observed only with <e>heregulin</e>, neuregulin2beta, epiregulin and the synthetic heregulin/egf chimera, biregulin. These studies also revealed that ErbB2 preferentially enhances ligand binding to ErbB3 or ErbB4 and to a lesser degree to ErbB1.",M1
10077665,"Induction of utrophin gene expression by <e>heregulin</e> in skeletal muscle cells: role of the N-box motif and GA binding protein.The modulation of utrophin gene expression in muscle by the nerve-derived factor agrin plausibly involves the trophic factor ARIA/heregulin. Here we show that heregulin treatment of mouse and human cultured myotubes caused a approximately 2.5-fold increase in utrophin mRNA levels. Transient transfection experiments with utrophin promoter-reporter gene constructs showed that this increase resulted from an enhanced transcription of the utrophin gene. In the case of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor delta and epsilon subunit genes, heregulin was previously reported to stimulate transcription via a conserved promoter element, the N-box, which binds the multimeric Ets-related transcription factor GA binding protein (GABP). Accordingly, site-directed mutagenesis of a single N-box motif in the utrophin gene promoter abolished the transcriptional response to heregulin. In addition, overexpression of heregulin, or of the two GABP subunits in cultured myotubes, caused an N-box-dependent increase of the utrophin promoter activity. In vivo, direct gene transfer into muscle confirmed that heregulin regulates utrophin gene expression. Finally, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift experiments performed with muscle extracts revealed that the N-box of the utrophin promoter binds GABP. These findings suggest that the subsynaptic activation of transcription by heregulin via the N-box motif and GABP are conserved among genes expressed at the neuromuscular junction. Because utrophin can functionally compensate for the lack of dystrophin, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating utrophin gene transcription may ultimately lead to therapies based on utrophin expression throughout the muscle fibers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients.",M1
10066440,"The solution structure of <e>heregulin</e>-alpha and a N-terminal mutant with suppressed activity.NMR spectroscopy is used to compare the structure of the EGF-like domain of heregulin-alpha and HT1, a mutated form of heregulin-alpha with significantly reduced activity. HT1 is a chimeric protein that has the first seven residues of transforming growth factor-alpha and the sequence of heregulin-alpha from the first cysteine through the next 58 residues. The results demonstrate that both proteins share the same fold, including the triple stranded beta-sheet formed by the N-terminus and the B-loop. Analysis of the chemical shifts indicates that there are perturbations to the side chain packing of the beta-sheet. The observed changes in the chemical shifts show an interesting correspondence to the results from the homologue scan presented in the previous paper. These results indicate that the binding epitope for the native receptor extends across the beta-sheet and includes residues Leu179, Lys181, Leu209, and Lys211.",M1
9858839,"Proliferation of human Schwann cells induced by neu differentiation factor isoforms.Neu differentiation factor (NDF), a 44-kD polypeptide, is a member of the neuregulin family which also includes glial growth factor, <e>heregulin</e> and acetylcholine-receptor-inducing activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that NDF/glial growth factor/heregulin/acetylcholine-receptor-including activity are products of neurons and mediate proliferation, differentiation and gene expression in Schwann cells of experimental animals. In the present study, the efficacy of different isoforms of NDF in stimulating human Schwann cell proliferation is investigated in Schwann-cell-enriched cultures derived from fetal human dorsal root ganglia (15-20 weeks gestation). NDF isoforms examined include alpha1, alpha2, EGF-like domain alpha2 (EGFalpha2), alpha3, beta1, EGFbeta1, EGFbeta, beta2 and beta3. For the assessment of Schwann cell proliferation, double immunostaining using antibodies specific for S-100 protein and bromodeoxyuridine was used. While treatment of Schwann cells with NDF alpha isoforms (alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 and EGFalpha2) had little effect on Schwann cell proliferation, NDF beta isoforms (beta1, beta2, beta3, EGFbeta1 and EGFbeta) induced a greatly enhanced proliferation in Schwann cells. The proliferation index in unstimulated Schwann cells was 1.3 +/- 0.9%, whereas in Schwann cells treated with NDFbeta isoforms the proliferation index was 21.8 +/- 2.2%. The finding that the truncated beta isoforms such as EGFbeta1 and EGFbeta retain a mitogenic activity as potent as full-length beta isoform indicates that the C-terminal portion of the EGF-like domain is responsible for its receptor binding and subsequent biological activity.",M1
9815853,"<e>Heregulin</e> and agonistic anti-p185(c-erbB2) antibodies inhibit proliferation but increase invasiveness of breast cancer cells that overexpress p185(c-erbB2): increased invasiveness may contribute to poor prognosis.Overexpression of p185(c-erbB2) (p185/NEU/HER2) by tumor cells is associated with a poor prognosis in many but not all studies of breast and ovarian cancer. The poor prognosis associated with overexpression of p185(c-erbB2) could result from an increased growth rate or increased invasive potential. The p185(c-erbB2) tyrosine kinase receptor can be activated with agonistic antibodies directed against p185(c-erbB2) or with the ligand heregulin through a combinatorial interaction with erbB3 or erbB4. Consequently, we have asked whether heregulin or agonistic antibodies increase anchorage-independent growth or invasiveness of the SKBr3 breast cancer cell line, which overexpresses p185(c-erbB2). Incubation of SKBr3 breast cancer cells with heregulin inhibited anchorage-independent growth while enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation of p185(c-erbB2). Heregulin treatment also increased adhesion of SKBr3 cells to plastic and increased invasiveness of tumor cells into Matrigel membranes while increasing expression of the CD44 (HCAM) and CD54 (ICAM-1) adhesion molecules. Tumor cell invasion of Matrigel membranes was partially blocked by either anti-CD44 or anti-CD54 antibodies, indicating a role for these adhesion molecules in the invasion process. Compatible with the increased invasiveness, heregulin increased expression of the matrix metalloproteinase 9. In contrast, the agonistic anti-p185(c-erbB2) antibody ID5 induced only a subset of the responses induced by heregulin. ID5 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p185(c-erbB2), increased invasiveness, and increased expression of CD44. Despite the similarity of effects of ID5 and heregulin on some outcomes, the ID5 antibody failed to increase adhesion to plastic, expression of CD54, or production of matrix metalloproteinase 9. Thus, the ID5 agonistic anti-p185(c-erbB2) antibody mimics rather than antagonizes some but not all of the actions of heregulin. Moreover, the poor prognosis of breast and ovarian cancers that overexpress p185(c-erbB2) could relate in part to enhanced invasiveness rather than to increased proliferative capacity.",M1
9790934,"Homologue scanning mutagenesis of <e>heregulin</e> reveals receptor specific binding epitopes.The EGF domain of heregulin has all the receptor binding characteristics of full-length heregulin and has strong homology to the ligands for erbB-1. Despite this, it does not bind erbB-1 but instead binds erbB-3 and erbB-4. The sequence similarity between HRG and the erbB-1 ligands suggest that a few residues are responsible for receptor binding specificity. To determine the sequences involved in receptor binding, we performed homologue scanning mutagenesis on the EGF domain of HRGalpha using sequences of TGFalpha or EGF. We found three sets of mutations in the N-terminal subdomain that were responsible for receptor binding specificity. Mutations in the C-terminal subdomain affected the binding affinity, but did appear to confer any specificity.",M1
9772300,"NRG-3 in human breast cancers: activation of multiple erbB family proteins.Ligands of the EGF/<e>Heregulin</e> family control the growth of epithelial cells by binding to receptors of the erbB family. By searching a large database of cDNA sequences at Human Genome Sciences Inc. we have identified a new encoded protein sequence containing all the conserved elements of the EGF/Heregulin family. The same sequence has recently been independently identified as NRG-3. The EGF-like domain of NRG-3 was generated as a recombinant protein in E. coli and used to test the specificity of receptor binding. In human breast cancer cells and in 32D cells transfected by erbB family members, NRG-3 activated multiple erbB family members. These include EGF receptor (erbB1) and erbB4 when expressed individually and erbB2 and erbB3 when expressed together. Recombinant NRG-3 altered the growth of human breast cancer cells growing in vitro. NRG-3 was expressed in cell lines derived from breast cancer. These results indicate that NRG-3 is a potential regulator of normal and malignant breast epithelial cells in vivo.",M1
9718081,"Expression of mRNA for <e>heregulin</e> and its receptor, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4, in human upper gastrointestinal mucosa.Expression of mRNA for heregulin (HRG), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family and its receptors, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4, were evaluated in human upper gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa. Multi-target reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis using capillary electrophoresis and laser-induced fluorescence allowed us to quantify the minute amounts of mRNA from one biopsy specimen with high sensitivity. HRG, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 mRNA were detected in esophagus, stomach and duodenum and the highest expression was found in duodenum. In gastric cancer, mRNA for ErbB-4 was significantly overexpressed. Immunoreactivity of ErbB-4 in carcinoma cell membrane was also confirmed. These findings suggest that HRG and its receptors, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 may be physiologically significant in the human upper GI mucosa, especially in duodenum, and that ErbB-4 may contribute to the growth of gastric cancer.",M1
9693119,"Signal transduction by epidermal growth factor and <e>heregulin</e> via the kinase-deficient ErbB3 protein.The role of protein tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB3-mediated signal transduction was investigated. ErbB3 was phosphorylated in vivo in response to either heregulin (HRG) in cells expressing both ErbB3 and ErbB2, or epidermal growth factor (EGF) in cells expressing both ErbB3 and EGF receptor. A recombinant receptor protein (ErbB3-K/M, in which K/M stands for Lys--&gt;Met amino acid substitution) containing an inactivating mutation in the putative ATP-binding site was also phosphorylated in response to HRG and EGF. Both the wild-type ErbB3 and mutant ErbB3-K/M proteins transduced signals to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Separate kinase-inactivating mutations in the EGF receptor and ErbB2 proteins abolished ErbB3 phosphorylation and signal transduction activated by EGF and HRG respectively. Hence the protein tyrosine kinase activity necessary for growth factor signalling via the ErbB3 protein seems to be provided by coexpressed EGF and ErbB2 receptor proteins.",M1
9642091,"Backbone dynamics of the EGF-like domain of <e>heregulin</e>-alpha.The backbone dynamics of the 63 residue epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of heregulin-alpha (HRG-alpha) have been characterized by measurement of longitudinal relaxation rate constants (R1), transverse relaxation rate constants (R2), and steady-state ¿1H¿-15N nuclear Overhauser effects for the 15N nuclear spins using proton-detected heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Analysis of the R2/R1 ratios in conjunction with the known structure of the HRG-alpha EGF-like domain yields a rotational correlation time of approximately 8.4 ns, suggesting that the protein aggregates under the solution conditions used (3.8 mM protein, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 20 degreesC), and that it tumbles with an axially symmetric diffusion tensor (D parallel/D perpendicular=1.4). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments confirm that the EGF-like domain of HRG-alpha undergoes weak self-association under these conditions and are consistent with a simple monomer-dimer equilibrium with a dimer-dissociation constant Kd=1.6(+/-0.4) mM. The relaxation data were analyzed using a reduced spectral density mapping approach to avoid systematic effects of aggregation on the usual model-free formalism. The reduced spectral densities show that residues near the N terminus (residues 3 to 5 and 7 to 12), in the Omega-loop between beta-strands 2 and 3 (residues 24 to 31), and in particular the C-terminal 13 residues (residues 51 to 63), have significant mobility on a picosecond/nanosecond time-scale. In addition, conformational exchange on a microsecond time-scale was identified for residues 44 to 46 on the basis of observed differences in R2 at 11.7 and 14.1 T. The mobility identified near the N terminus and in the vicinity of residues 44 to 46 may be important in allowing the interactions of heregulin with multiple receptors.",M1
9606190,"Implication of a multisubunit Ets-related transcription factor in synaptic expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.In adult muscle, transcription of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is restricted to the nuclei located at the neuromuscular junction. The N-box, a new promoter element, was identified recently and shown to contribute to this compartmentalized synaptic expression of the AChR delta- and epsilon-subunits. We demonstrate that the N-box mediates transcriptional activation in cultured myotubes and identify the transcription factor that binds to the N-box as a heterooligomer in myotubes and adult muscle. The GABP (GA-binding protein) alpha-subunit belongs to the Ets family of transcription factors, whereas the beta-subunit shares homology with IkappaB and Drosophila Notch protein. GABP binding specificity to mutated N-box in vitro strictly parallels the sequence requirement for beta-galactosidase targeting to the endplate in vivo. In situ hybridization studies reveal that the mRNAs of both GABP subunits are abundant in mouse diaphragm, with preferential expression of the alpha-subunit at motor endplates. In addition, <e>heregulin</e> increases GABPalpha protein levels and regulates phosphorylation of both subunits in cultured chick myotubes. Finally, dominant-negative mutants of either GABPalpha or GABPbeta block heregulin-elicited transcriptional activation of the AChR delta and epsilon genes. These findings establish the expected connection with a presynaptic trophic factor whose release contributes to the accumulation of AChR subunit mRNAs at the motor endplate.",M1
9637684,"The ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors and their ligand, neuregulin-1, are essential for development of the sympathetic nervous system.Neuregulins (NDF, <e>heregulin</e>, GGF ARIA, or SMDF) are EGF-like growth and differentiation factors that signal through tyrosine kinase receptors of the ErbB family. Here, we report a novel phenotype in mice with targeted mutations in the erbB2, erbB3, or neuregulin-1 genes. These three mutations cause a severe hypoplasia of the primary sympathetic ganglion chain. We provide evidence that migration of neural crest cells to the mesenchyme lateral of the dorsal aorta, in which they differentiate into sympathetic neurons, depends on neuregulin-1 and its receptors. Neuregulin-1 is expressed at the origin of neural crest cells. Moreover, a tight link between neuregulin-1 expression, the migratory path, and the target site of sympathogenic neural crest cells is observed. Sympathetic ganglia synthesize catecholamines in the embryo and the adult. Accordingly, catecholamine levels in mutant embryos are severely decreased, and we suggest that the lack of catecholamines contributes to the embryonal lethality of the erbB3 mutant mice. Thus, neuregulin-1, erbB2, and erbB3 are required for the formation of the sympathetic nervous system; the block in development observed in mutant mice is caused by a lack of neural crest precursor cells in the anlage of the primary sympathetic ganglion chain. Together with previous observations, these findings establish the neuregulin signaling system as a key regulator in the development of neural crest cells.",M1
9488037,"Signal transduction pathways activated and required for mammary carcinogenesis in response to specific oncogenes.We have assessed five signal transduction pathways to determine the role each might play in the malignant transformation of mammary epithelium initiated by neu, <e>heregulin</e>/NDF, TGFalpha, v-Ha-ras and c-myc in transgenic mice. The study involves a molecular and pharmacologic assessment of Erk/MAP kinase, Jnk/SAP kinase, PI 3-kinase, protein kinase C, and the Src-related kinases Lck and Fyn. Our results indicate that oncogenes capable of transforming mammary gland epithelium activate and require specific signal transduction pathways. For example, mammary tumors initiated by neu, v-Ha-ras and c-myc have high levels of active Erk/MAP kinase and their anchorage independent growth is strongly inhibited by PD098059, an inhibitor of Mek/ MAP kinase kinase. By contrast, Erk/MAP kinase activity is weak in tumors initiated by TFGalpha and heregulin/NDF and the corresponding cell lines are not growth inhibited by PD098059. Similarly, PI 3-kinase is strongly activated in neu, TGFalpha and heregulin/NDF initiated tumor cell lines, but not in c-myc or v-Ha-ras initiated tumor cell lines. The anchorage independent growth of all these tumor cell lines are, however, inhibited by the specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294001. Further illustrating this oncogene-based specificity, PP1, a specific inhibitor of the Src-like kinases, Lck and Fyn, blocks anchorage-independent cell growth only in the TGFalpha initiated mammary tumor cell line. Taken together with additional observations, we conclude that certain oncogenes reliably require the recruitment/activation of specific signal transduction pathways. Such specific relationships between the initiating oncogene and a required pathway may reflect a direct activating effect or the parallel activation of a pathway that is a necessary oncogenic collaborator for transformation in the mammary gland. The work points to a molecular basis for targeting therapy when an initiating oncogene can be implicated; for example, because of amplification, increased expression, genetic alteration, or heritable characteristics.",M1
9440030,"<e>Heregulins</e> and the ErbB-2/3/4 receptors in gliomas.The activation of autocrine loops involving proto-oncogene related receptor tyrosine kinases has led to the analysis of a large number of growth factor systems in human glioma specimens and cell lines. The ErbB-2 system, also called HER-2 or neu, is analogous to the epidermal growth factor receptor system (EGF-R, ErbB-1). Neuregulins consist of a large family of proteins arising from alternative mRNA splicing of a single gene located at 8p22-p11. Activation of ErbB-2 by neuregulins occurs in heterodimeric complexes with ErbB-3 and ErbB-4. A panel of human glioma cell lines, which had previously been analyzed for ErbB-2 expression, was examined for ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 expression. Coordinate expression of ErbB-2, -3 or -4 was not observed in these cell lines. Despite the presence of a complete system capable of signaling in about half the cell lines, no constitutive activation of ErbB-2, -3 or -4 was observed, and autophosphorylation of ErbB-2 in response to heregulin was observed only in one cell line from the panel, NCE-G84. Moreover, the addition of recombinant heregulin or antibodies capable of disrupting ErbB-2/ErbB-3 complexes had no effect on cell proliferation. We conclude that the role of neuregulins and its receptors in the control of glioma cell proliferation may be limited or may be context dependent on in situ conditions which are lost in vitro. Alternatively, neuregulins may be involved in cell differentiation or survival in the central nervous system. Data supporting these conclusions are described in more detail herein.",M1
9414162,"Neuregulin-beta induces expression of an NMDA-receptor subunit.Neuregulins (also known as ARIA, NDF, <e>heregulin</e>, GGF) are a family of widely expressed growth and differentiation factors. Neuregulins secreted from motor neurons accumulate at maturing neuromuscular junctions, where they stimulate transcription of genes encoding specific acetylcholine receptors. How these factors function at central synapses, however, is unknown. In the maturing cerebellum, neuregulins are concentrated in glutamatergic mossy fibres that innervate granule cells in the internal granule-cell layer. We have analysed the effects of neuregulins on the expression of genes encoding NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors in the cerebellum, because receptor composition changes dramatically as expression of the receptor NR2C subunit is specifically induced in neurons in the internal granule-cell layer during synaptogenesis. Here we report that addition of a neuregulin-beta isoform to cultured cerebellar slices specifically increases the expression of NR2C messenger RNAs by at least 100-fold; effects are only minor with a neuregulin-alpha isoform. This stimulation of NR2C expression requires synaptic activity by NMDA receptors, as well as neuregulin-beta. Addition of the NMDA-receptor-channel blocker AP-5 prevents upregulation of the NR2C subunit by neuregulin, whereas an AMPA/kainate-receptor antagonist does not. Consistent with these effects of neuregulin, we find that granule cells express its receptors ErbB2 and ErbB4 before the NR2C subunit of the NMDA receptor. Our results indicate that neuregulins regulate the composition of neurotransmitter receptors in maturing synapses in the brain, in a manner analogous to the neuromuscular junction.",M1
9400997,"ErbB kinases and NDF signaling in human prostate cancer cells.Prostate carcinoma (PCA) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in American men. Our knowledge of PCA growth regulation lags behind that of other cancers, such as breast and colon carcinomas. Among receptor tyrosine kinases, the ErbB family is most frequently implicated in neoplasia. We report here the expression of ErbB family kinases and their ligands in PCA cell lines and a xenograft. While ErbB1/EGFR, ErbB2/NEU, and ErbB3 were always observed in a distinct pattern, ErbB4 was not observed. Interestingly, while TGF-alpha was expressed in the majority of PCA lines, the ligand Neu Differentiation Factor/<e>Heregulin</e> (NDF) was expressed only in an immortalized, non-transformed prostate epithelial line. Concomitantly, there was a significant difference in biological response to these ligands. NDF inhibited LNCaP growth and induced an epithelial-like morphological change, in contrast to TGF-alpha, which accelerated cell growth. We also performed the first comprehensive analysis of NDF signaling in a prostate line. LNCaP stimulated with NDF demonstrated crosstalk between ErbB3 and ErbB2 which did not involve ErbB1. NDF also turned on several cascades, including those of PI3-K, ERK/MAPK, mHOG/p38 and JNK/SAPK, but not those of PLCgamma or the STAT family. This signaling pattern is distinct from that of TGF-alpha. The activation of mHOG by ErbB2 or ErbB3 has not been reported, and may contribute to the unusual phenotype. PI3-K activation is characterized by the formation of a striking 'activation complex' with multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated species, including ErbB3. Our studies provide a framework in which to dissect the growth and differentiation signals of prostate cancer cells.",M1
9342050,"Isoform-specific expression and function of neuregulin.Neuregulin (also known as NDF, <e>heregulin</e>, ARIA, GGF or SMDF), induces cell growth and differentiation. Biological effects of neuregulin are mediated by members of the erbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors. Three major neuregulin isoforms are produced from the gene, which differ substantially in sequence and in overall structure. Here we use in situ hybridization with isoform-specific probes to illustrate the spatially distinct patterns of expression of the isoforms during mouse development. Ablation of the neuregulin gene in the mouse has demonstrated multiple and independent functions of this factor in development of both the nervous system and the heart. We show here that targeted mutations that affect different isoforms result in distinct phenotypes, demonstrating that isoforms can take over specific functions in vivo. Type I neuregulin is required for generation of neural crest-derived neurons in cranial ganglia and for trabeculation of the heart ventricle, whereas type III neuregulin plays an important role in the early development of Schwann cells. The complexity of neuregulin functions in development is therefore due to independent roles played by distinct isoforms.",M1
9285119,"Clinicopathologic analysis of amphiregulin and <e>heregulin</e> immunostaining in breast neoplasia.We observed no association between neoplastic epithelial immunostaining for either amphiregulin (AR) or heregulin (HRG) and presence of ER, EGFR/ERBB-2 overexpression, nodal status, or disease recurrence in 34 breast carcinomas. However, stromal cell staining for both correlated with outcome; 29% of stromal cell AR - cases recurred vs. 85% for AR + cases (p = 0.001), and 41% of stromal cell HRG - cases recurred vs. 82% of HRG + cases (p = 0.01). We conclude that both HRG and AR have significant biologic roles in breast carcinoma growth or progression via mediation of host-tumor interactions which favor aggressive tumor behavior.",M1
9242460,"Prognostic significance of HER2 and HER4 coexpression in childhood medulloblastoma.Recent in vitro studies of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family have revealed complex signaling interactions involving the production of ligand-mediated heterodimers synergistic for the transformation of cells in vitro. In a series of 70 patients with childhood medulloblastoma, we have used immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analysis to investigate the expression patterns of all four EGFR family members (EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4) and <e>heregulin</e>-alpha, a ligand for the HER3 and HER4 receptors. The majority of cases expressed two or more receptor proteins; coexpression of the HER2 and HER4 receptors occurred in 54%. Expression of the ligand heregulin-alpha was detected in 31% of tumors. To investigate whether coexpression results in receptor heterodimerization, we have also performed immunoprecipitation analysis of protein extracts from primary tumors, and we demonstrate various patterns of receptor interaction including between HER2 and HER4. In multivariate 25-year survival analysis with clinicopathological disease features, no individual receptor or heregulin-alpha achieved significance. In contrast, when considered together in the multivariate model, coexpression of HER2 and HER4 demonstrated independent prognostic significance (P = 0.006). These data suggest the hypothesis that HER2-HER4 receptor heterodimerization is of particular biological significance in this disease, and this report is the first to demonstrate potential clinical significance of EGFR family heterodimerization in human cancer. Finally, we have also analyzed expression of the AP-2 transcription factor implicated in the positive regulation of HER2 and HER3 gene transcription in malignant cells and reveal an association between AP-2 expression and not only HER2 and HER3, but also HER4 levels in medulloblastoma primary tumors.",M1
9168114,"Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene.Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, <e>heregulin</e> or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.",M1
9105049,"Axonal neuregulin signals cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage through activation of HER4 and Schwann cells through HER2 and HER3.We are interested in the signaling between axons and glia that leads to myelination and maintenance of the myelin internode, and we have focused on the role of neuregulins and their receptors. Neuregulins are a family of ligands that includes <e>heregulin</e>, neu differentiation factor, glial growth factor, and the acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity. Three signal transducing transmembrane receptors for neuregulins, which bear significant homology to the EGF receptor, are currently known: HER2 (erbB2), HER3 (erbB3), and HER4 (erbB4). We have found that oligodendrocite-type II astrocyte (O2A) progenitor cells and mature oligodendrocytes express HER2 and HER4 but no HER3. Schwann cells express HER2 and HER3 but little HER4. In O2A progenitor cells and oligodendrocytes, recombinant neuregulin induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of only HER4. HER2 is not phosphorylated in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage, but a physical interaction between HER2 and HER4 was detected in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. In Schwann cells, neuregulin induces the phosphorylation of both HER2 and HER3. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that receptor activation in Schwann cells results in the formation of HER2:HER3 heterodimers. Neuregulin localized immunocytochemically was present on neurites of cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons, and it was released into the medium in a form that promoted receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Neuregulins therefore meet important criteria expected of molecules involved in axonal-glial signaling. The use of unique neuregulin receptor combinations in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells likely results in recruitment of different signaling pathways and thus provides a basis for different biological responses.",M1
9052472,"A potential autocrine loop between <e>heregulin</e>-alpha and erbB-3 receptor in human prostatic adenocarcinoma.OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression of heregulin-alpha (a new member of the epidermal growth factor family) and its receptor erbB-3 in human prostate cancer by immunohistochemistry, and to analyse their implication for clinical outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using specific anti-peptide antibodies, tumour samples from 50 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer (18 well, 15 moderately and 17 poorly differentiated) and four patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were immunostained for heregulin-alpha (an isoform of heregulin) and erbB-3 proteins. Representative areas from each case were used to assess immunoreactivity. RESULTS: Heregulin-alpha was expressed (i.e. &gt; or = 10% of tumour cells positive) in 36 (72%) and erbB-3 in 27 (54%) of the 50 cases. High levels of expression of heregulin-alpha (&gt; 90% of tumour cells stained) appeared to be related to high-grade tumours, but the association did not reach statistical significance. There was no correlation between the levels of expression of erbB-3 and tumour grade. All four samples from BPH stained negatively for heregulin-alpha and erbB-3. Fourteen patients had bony metastases identified by bone scintigraphy and all received androgen ablation after undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. Immunoreactivity for heregulin-alpha and erbB-3 were absent in five cases, all of whom responded to hormone manipulation and remained symptom-free at the time of review (mean follow up 3 years, range 2-4). Despite hormone manipulation, the nine patients overexpressing heregulin-alpha and/or erbB-3 died during a mean follow up of 2.5 years (range 0.5-4). CONCLUSION: The overexpression of heregulin-alpha and erbB-3 in prostate cancer is detectable by immunostaining. Activation of the type 1 growth-factor receptor system by heregulin-alpha and/or the erbB-3 receptor appears to be associated with a less favourable prognosis in advanced disease.",M1
8999872,"Association of csk-homologous kinase (CHK) (formerly MATK) with HER-2/ErbB-2 in breast cancer cells.Protein-tyrosine kinases, such as HER-2/ErbB-2, have been specifically linked to breast cancer. The Csk-homologous kinase (CHK), formerly MATK, is a tyrosine kinase that contains the Src homology 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3) domains and demonstrates homology ( approximately 50%) to the Csk tyrosine kinase. Like Csk, CHK is able to phosphorylate and inactivate Src family kinases. In this report, we investigated whether CHK is expressed in breast cancer tissues and whether it participates in the ErbB-2 signaling pathway in T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Immunostaining of the CHK protein in breast tissues demonstrated that primary invasive ductal carcinomas, stage II (13 of 15 cases) and stage I (8 of 15 cases), expressed the CHK protein, while this protein was not detected in the adjacent normal tissues from the same patients. To study the role of CHK in the ErbB-2 signaling pathway, glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the SH2 and SH3 domains of CHK were generated. CHK-SH2 and CHK-SH3-SH2, but not CHK-SH3 or CHK-NH2-SH3, precipitated the tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB-2 upon stimulation with <e>heregulin</e>. EGF or interleukin-6 stimulation of T47D cells failed to induce CHK-SH2 association with ErbB-2, the EGF-receptor, or the interleukin-6 receptor. In vivo association of the tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB-2 with CHK was observed in co-immunoprecipitation studies with anti-CHK antibodies. EGF-R, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4 were not detected in the CHK immunoprecipitates or in the precipitates of the GST-SH2 fusion proteins of CHK, suggesting that the association of CHK with ErbB-2 upon heregulin stimulation is receptor-specific (ErbB-2) and ligand-specific (heregulin). These results indicate that CHK might participate in signaling in breast cancer cells by associating, via its SH2 domain, with ErbB-2 following heregulin stimulation.",M1
9072304,"Tissue expression of neu differentiation factor/<e>heregulin</e> and its receptor complex in prostate cancer and its biologic effects on prostate cancer cells in vitro.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men and the second leading cause of cancer death. All clinical observations correlate poorly differentiated high-grade prostate cancer with disease-specific mortality. The HER2 cell membrane tyrosine kinase, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family that is the transcription product of the erbB2neu oncogene, and HER3, a receptor protein of the same family, are overexpressed in prostate cancer and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The ligand for these receptors and another related family member, HER4, has recently been identified by independent investigator groups and called neu differentiation factor (NDF) or heregulin. In vitro treatment of HER2- and HER3- or HER2- and HER4-expressing breast cancer cells stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 and produces changes in the rate of proliferation, degree of cellular differentiation, and synthesis of physiologic secretion products. There are no published reports on the expression of NDF and HER4 in prostate cancer or the in vitro effects of NDF in prostate cancer cells. METHODS: Expression of NDF, HER2, HER3, and HER4 was studied in 24 frozen prostatectomy specimens by immunohistochemistry. The biologic effect of human recombinant NDF was studied in vitro, using the LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 human prostate cancer cell lines. HER and NDF protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry. NDF mRNA was analyzed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from whole RNA. The biologic effects of NDF on prostate cancer cells in vitro included cell proliferation, thymidine synthesis, induction of prostate-specific antigen mRNA, anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent cell growth, and ploidy analysis. Data analysis was performed using Student's t test. RESULTS: Observations in clinical prostatectomy specimens: Immunohistochemistry studies in clinical prostatectomy specimens demonstrate absence of significant NDF expression in prostate cancer, whereas it is expressed in 100% of the stroma, 100% of basal epithelial cells, and 58% of luminal cells in normal and benign hyperplastic prostatic tissue. The HER4 receptor protein is strongly expressed by normal prostate luminal cells, but not prostate cancer. Benign prostate tissue exhibits strong expression of HER2, HER3, and HER4 by basal cells, but only luminal cells significantly express HER4. Only 23% of prostate cancer specimens express HER4, while 95% express HER3 and 82% HER2. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia stained similarly to cancer for all proteins studied. Observations in prostate cancer cell lines: In vitro treatment with NDF significantly reduces aneuploidy and proliferation and growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Incubation with NDF also induces prostate-specific antigen mRNA in prostate cancer cells. In spite of displaying NDF mRNA, prostate cancer cells do not produce detectable NDF protein, but express HER2 and HER3 proteins. DISCUSSION: These data suggest that NDF may be a paracrine differentiation factor involved in normal adult prostate physiology and that functional loss of the NDF/HER ligand/ receptor loop may be an early event associated with prostate tumorigenesis.",M1
8853899,"<e>Heregulin</e> induces in vivo proliferation and differentiation of mammary epithelium into secretory lobuloalveoli.Mammary gland development and differentiation is mediated through the combined activities of systemic hormones and locally synthesized growth factors. To determine the in vivo response of mammary epithelium to heregulin (HRG), we implanted Elvax pellets containing HRG alpha or HRG beta within the mammary glands of prepubescent female mice in the presence or absence of exogenous estradiol and progesterone (E/ P). Mice treated in the same way with transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) were included as a positive control. Each growth factor treatment induced epithelial ductal branching in the presence or absence of E/P. In the absence of E/P, HRG beta did not effect terminal end bud formation, mammary epitheilum branching, or ductal migration. In contrast, TGF-alpha and HRG alpha induced ductal branching and HRG alpha induced ductal migration in the absence of E/P. The overall mammary response to growth factors was potentiated by the concomitant presence of E/P. In every case, the in vivo mammary epithelial responses to HRG alpha were more robust than TGF-alpha. Limited lobuloalveolar development was also observed in growth factor-treated mammary glands when E/P was present. Histological examination of growth factor-induced lobuloalveoli revealed secretory products within the lumen of HRG alpha and HRG beta lobuloalveoli. TGF-alpha-induced lobuloalveoli lacked similar secretory products.",M1
8780647,"GGF/neuregulin is a neuronal signal that promotes the proliferation and survival and inhibits the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors.We show that GGF/neuregulin is a mitogen for prooligodendrocytes (O4+/O1- cells), oligodendrocytes (O4+/O1+ cells), and type-2 astrocytes. <e>Heregulin</e> beta 1, another neuregulin isoform, is also mitogenic. The proliferative effect of glial growth factor (GGF) does not require, but is greatly potentiated by, serum factors. GGF also promotes the survival of pro-oligodendrocytes under serum-free conditions. High levels of GGF reversibly inhibit the differentiation and lineage commitment of oligodendrocyte progenitors and, in differentiated cultures, result in loss of O1 and myelin basic protein expression. All three erbB receptors are expressed by progenitors and are activated by GGF; the relative abundance of these receptors changes during differentiation. Finally, cortical neurons release a soluble mitogen for pro-oligodendrocytes that is specifically blocked by antibodies to GGF. These results implicate the neuregulins in the neuronal regulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation, survival, and differentiation.",M1
8700512,"Neu differentiation factor (<e>Heregulin</e>) activates a p53-dependent pathway in cancer cells.Previously we reported that neu differentiation factor (NDF)/heregulin (HRG) elevates tyrosine phosphorylation of its receptors erbB-3, erbB-4, and erbB-2 (through heterodimer formation). We also showed that both NDF/HRG and antibodies to erbB-2 can arrest growth and induce differentiation in breast cancer cells. In this study, we report on the mechanism of NDF/HRG-induced cellular effects. We show that NDF/HRG and antibodies to erbB-2 receptors up-regulate expression of p53 by stabilizing the protein. This is accompanied by up-regulation of the p53 inducible gene, p21CIP1/WAF1, in a variety of cell lines: MCF7 and their derivatives (MCF7/HER2, MN1 and MCF-7-puro), ZR75T and LnCap cells. The induction of p21 is further enhanced when cells are treated with both NDF/HRG and DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents (i.e. doxorubicin). The NDF/HRG mediated induction of p21 is dependent on wildtype p53, as it fails to occur in cells expressing dominant negative p53 (MDD2). Furthermore, p21 induction is capable of inactivating cdk2 complexes as measured by Histone H1 phosphorylation assays. Finally, we show that in primary cultures of breast and other cancers, p21 is significantly induced in response to NDF/HRG treatment. Collectively, these observations suggest that the mechanism of breast cancer cell growth inhibition and differentiation via erbB receptors activation is through a p53-mediated pathway.",M1
8732665,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase recruitment by p185erbB-2 and erbB-3 is potently induced by neu differentiation factor/<e>heregulin</e> during mitogenesis and is constitutively elevated in growth factor-independent breast carcinoma cells with c-erbB-2 gene amplification.Amplification and overexpression of the c-erbB-2 gene in 21MT-2 and 21MT-1 human breast carcinoma cells results in progressively elevated levels of constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated p185erbB-2 and is associated with progressive insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and combined IGF/epidermal growth factor (EGF) independence in culture. In addition, the neu differentiation factor/heregulins (HRGs), a family of ligands that activate p185erbB-2 through direct binding to erbB-3 or erbB-4, are potent mitogens for various nonneoplastic mammary epithelial cells and carcinoma cell lines in the absence of both IGF and EGF in culture. We have investigated the ability of ligand induction with HRGs or the constitutive activation of p185erbB-2 in the 21MT breast carcinoma cells to induced the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by p185erbB-2 and erbB-3. HRG was found to potently induce the recruitment of the M(r) 85,000 regulatory subunit of PI3K by phosphotyrosine proteins in both nonneoplastic H16N-2 mammary epithelial cells (which express normal c-erbB-2 levels) and in the 21MT-2 and 21MT-1 cell lines, which were all isolated from a single patient with intraductal and invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and express c-erbB-3 but not c-erbB-4 in culture. The activation of PI3K in these cells was also associated with high-level mitogenic responsiveness to HRG, as well as the IGF/EGF-independent proliferation of the 21MT cell lines in culture. The recruitment of PI3K by phosphotyrosine protein during ligand-induced activation, or that seen constitutively in the 21MT tumor cells, did not involve detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of p85. The HRG-induced recruitment of p85 and the constitutive recruitment of p85 in the 21MT cell lines involved direct association with both p185erbB-2 and erbB-3, although greater levels were recruited directly by erbB-3. Wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI3K enzymatic activity, also blocked the autonomous proliferation of the 21MT cells, and this effect was reversible in long-term cultures. These data indicate that PI3K may be an especially important mediator of HRG-induced proliferation in mammary epithelial cells and is involved in the autonomous proliferation of growth factor-independent breast carcinoma cells with c-erbB-2 gene amplification.",M1
8622899,"NDF/<e>heregulin</e> induces persistence of terminal end buds and adenocarcinomas in the mammary glands of transgenic mice.Neu differentiation factor (NDF), a member of the neuregulin family of ligands of erbB receptors, induces both differentiative and mitogenic effects on cultured human mammary epithelial cells. Since members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, including Neu/erbB2, have been implicated in mammary carcinoma, we wished to know whether a potential ligand of this family, NDF, could induce such effects in the mammary gland in vivo. We therefore targeted expression of NDF to the mammary gland of transgenic mice using the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter in a fusion construct. There was a clear, but subtle effect on development of the adult virgin gland of female transgenic animals. Terminal end bud structures (TEBs), which normally disappear from the mammary gland at the age of approximately 8 weeks in wild type mice, persist in glands of virgin MMTV-NDF transgenic females, suggesting that NDF inhibits signals that normally lead to the terminal differentiation of these structures. Further, female mice, bred continuously to maximize expression of the transgene in the mammary gland, develop mammary adenocarcinomas at a median age of 12 months. Since these tumors arise in a solitary fashion, we infer that NDF is necessary, but not sufficient for their formation. In order to explore the signal transduction pathways potentially activated by NDF, we examined expression of the receptors erbB2, erbB3 and erbB4 in mammary epithelial cells established from an NDF-induced tumor. All three receptors were expressed, though only the erbB3 receptor was phosphorylated, suggesting that overexpression of NDF might operate through this receptor. Additionally, about 50% of MMTV-NDF transgenic mice developed Harderian (lachrymal) gland hyperplasia, a benign tumor that does not progress to frank malignancy.",M1
8631797,"An immunological approach reveals biological differences between the two NDF/<e>heregulin</e> receptors, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4.The group of subtype I transmembrane tyrosine kinases includes the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (ErbB-1), an orphan receptor (ErbB-2), and two receptors for the Neu differentiation factor (NDF/heregulin), namely: ErbB-3 and ErbB-4. Here we addressed the distinct functions of the two NDF receptors by using an immunological approach. Two sets of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 were generated through immunization with recombinant ectodomains of the corresponding receptors that were fused to immunoglobulin. We found that the shared ligand binds to highly immunogenic, but immunologically distinct sites of ErbB-3 and ErbB-4. NDF receptors differed also in their kinase activities; whereas the catalytic activity of ErbB-4 was activable by mAbs, ErbB-3 underwent no activation by mAbs in living cells. Likewise, down-regulation of ErbB-4, but not ErbB-3, was induced by certain mAbs. By using the generated mAbs, we found that the major NDF receptor on mammary epithelial cells is a heterodimer of ErbB-3 with ErbB-2, whereas an ErbB-1/ErbB-2 heterodimer, or an ErbB-1 homodimer, is the predominant species that binds EGF. Consistent with ErbB-2 being a shared receptor subunit, its tyrosine phosphorylation was increased by both heterologous ligands and it mediated a trans-inhibitory effect of NDF on EGF binding. Last, we show that the effect of NDF on differentiation of breast tumor cells can be mimicked by anti-ErbB-4 antibodies, but not by mAbs to ErbB-3. Nevertheless, an ErbB-3-specific mAb partially inhibited the effect of NDF on cellular differentiation. These results suggest that homodimers of ErbB-4 are biologically active, but heterodimerization of the kinase-defective ErbB-3, probably with ErbB-2, is essential for transmission of NDF signals through ErbB-3.",M1
8639490,"High-resolution solution structure of the EGF-like domain of <e>heregulin</e>-alpha.The solution structure of the 63-residue heregulin-alpha (HRG-alpha) epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, corresponding to residues 177-239 of HRG-alpha, has been determined to high resolution using data from two-dimensional and three-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The structure is based on a total of 887 internuclear distance and dihedral restraints derived from data obtained using unlabeled and uniformly 15N-labeled protein samples, at pH 4.5, 20 degrees C. A total of 20 structures were calculated using a hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing approach with the program DGII, followed by restrained molecular dynamics using the program DISCOVER. The average maximum violations are 0.12 +/- 0.01 angstroms and 1.4 +/- 0.3 degrees for distance and dihedral restraints, respectively. The backbone (N,C(alpha),C) atomic rms distribution about the mean coordinates for residues 3-23 and 31-49 is 0.29 +/- 0/07 angstroms. The N-and C-terminal residues (1-2 and 50-63) and 24-30 are disordered. Comparison of the HRG-alpha EGF-like domain structure with the previously determined structure of human EGF [Hommel et al. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 227, 271-282] reveals a high degree of structural similarity; excluding the N-terminal region (residues 1-13), the disordered phi-loop region (residues 24-30) that contains a three-residue insertion in HRG-alpha relative to hEGF, and the disordered C-terminal region (residues 50-63), the C(alpha) alignment between the HRG-alpha and hEGF minimized mean structures has a rms difference of approximately 1 angstrom. In HRG-alpha the N-terminal residues 2-6 form a well-defined beta strand rather than being disordered as found for hEGF. This structural difference correlates with functional data which suggest that the N-terminal region of the HRG-alpha EGF-like domain is responsible for the observed receptor specificity differences between HRG-alpha and EGF.",M1
8597535,"Insulin-like growth factor and epidermal growth factor independence in human mammary carcinoma cells with c-erbB-2 gene amplification and progressively elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated p185erbB-2.Growth factor-independent proliferation is an essential aspect of the transformation process. To study the influence of c-erbB-2 overexpression on the autonomous growth of human mammary cancer cells, we used a series of non-neoplastic and neoplastic human mammary epithelial cell lines isolated from a patient with intraductal and invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The non-neoplastic cell line, H16N-2, which expresses a normal level (single gene copy) of c-erbB-2, was used for comparison with the neoplastic cell lines. Both the metastatic tumor cell lines, 21MT-1 and 21 MT-2, showed equivalent amplification of the c-erbB-2 gene; however, 21MT-1 cells showed a higher level of c-erbB-2 overexpression. Therefore, the H16N-2, 21MT-2, and 21MT-1 cell series forms a distinct gradient of progressively increasing c-erbB-2 gene expression. Furthermore, the overexpression of c-erbB-2 in the 21MT cell lines was concordant with increases in the constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of p185erb-2 measured in the absence of exogenous growth factors in culture. Normal mammary epithelial cells require both insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-l (or supraphysiological concentrations of insulin) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) to proliferate under serum-free conditions in culture. By contrast, 21MT-2 cells showed a reduced requirement for IGF but still required EGF to proliferate. 21MT-1 cells did not require either insulin or EGF to proliferate. Therefore, the progressive increases in constitutive p185erbB-2, tyrosine kinase activity in the 21MT-2 and 21MT-1 cell lines was directly correlated with IGF independence and combined IGF and EGF independence under defined conditions in culture. Experiments using conditioned media and anti-IGF-1 receptor and anti-EGF receptor neutralizing antibodies showed that the growth-factor independence of the tumor cells did not involve detectable IGF- or EGF-like autocrine activity expressed by the 21MT cells. Furthermore, neu differentiation factor/<e>heregulin</e>, a ligand that indirectly activates p185erbB-2 by direct binding to erbB-3 receptors, potently stimulated the proliferation of the growth factor-dependent H16N-2 cells (which expressed c-erbB-2 and c-erbB-3 but not c-erbB-4) in the absence of both IGF and EGF. Thus, HRG-induced mitogenesis mimicked the autonomous growth seen in the 21MT cells that have the highest level of constitutive p185erbB-2 activation. These data support the hypothesis that the constitutive activation of p185erbB-2 in human mammary carcinoma cells causes growth-factor independence by directly activating multiple signal-transduction pathways that substitute for both IGF and EGF during proliferation.",M1
8599580,"Growth factor-independent proliferation of rat mammary carcinoma cells by autocrine secretion of neu-differentiation factor/<e>heregulin</e> and transforming growth factor-alpha.Serially transplantable rat mammary tumor (RMT) cells are not dependent on exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor-I for continuous growth in serum-free medium. Previously, we found that conditioned medium obtained from these cells contained EGF-like mitogenic activity and stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 185-kDa protein in EGF-dependent mammary epithelial cells. This protein is distinct from the EGF receptor and resembles a 185-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein present in RMT cells themselves. The results of the studies reported here indicate that the tyrosine-phosphorylated p185 detected in growth factor-independent RMT cells and in human mammary epithelial cells exposed to RMT-conditioned medium was activated erbB-2 protein. Partial purification of the activating factor present in RMT-conditioned medium yielded a heparin-binding growth factor with biochemical properties similar to those of neu differentiation factor/heregulin (NDF/HRG). RNA-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that RMT cells expressed mRNA for NDF/HRG, and western-blot analysis confirmed the presence of the 45-kDa secreted form of NDF/HRG in conditioned medium from the growth factor-independent RMT cells. The biological activity of partially purified rat NDF/HRG was examined and found to be the same as that of the pure growth factor. In addition, we found that RMT-conditioned medium, fractionated on an anion-exchange column and by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, contained a potent EGF-like growth factor that was distinct from NDF/HRG. This factor competes with 125I-EGF for binding to EGF receptors and has an apparent molecular mass of 6600 Da. This factor copurifies by high-pressure liquid chromatography with pure transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), and the cells are positive for TGF-alpha mRNA. Thus, growth factor-independent RMT cells also synthesize and secrete TGF-alpha. These results indicate that growth factor-independent cells secrete two growth factors with overlapping biological activities and suggest that autocrine loops mediated by these factors are important in the growth factor-independent proliferation of the RMT cells.",M1
8825123,"The significance of <e>heregulin</e> in breast cancer tumor progression and drug resistance.The erbB-2 receptor plays an important role in the prognosis of breast cancer and is expressed at high levels in nearly 30% of tumors in breast cancer patients. While evidence accumulates to support the relationship between erbB-2 overexpression and poor overall survival in human breast cancer, understanding of the biological consequence(s) of erbB-2 overexpression remains elusive. The discovery of heregulin has allowed us to identify a number of related but distinct biological endpoints which appear responsive to signal transduction through the erbB-2/4 receptor. These endpoints of growth, invasiveness, and differentiation have clear implications for the emergence, maintenance, and/or control of malignancy, and represent established endpoints in the assessment of malignant progression in human breast cancer. Preliminary studies in vitro have shown that heregulin induces a biphasic growth effect on cells with erbB-2 overexpression. Interestingly, we observed that expression of heregulin correlates with a more aggressive/invasive, vimentin-positive phenotype in breast cancer cells lines. Therefore, we have postulated that heregulin is involved in breast cancer tumor progression. We have shown that heregulin induces in vitro chemoinvasion and chemotaxis of breast cancer cells as well as growth in an anchorage dependent and independent manner. Interestingly, a heregulin neutralizing antibody inhibits chemotaxis and results in cell growth inhibition and blockade of the invasive phenotype. Strikingly, genetically engineered cells which constitutively express heregulin demonstrate critical phenotypic changes that are associated with a more aggressive phenotype. Specifically, these cells are no longer dependent on estrogen for growth and are resistant to tamoxifen in vitro and in vivo, and moreover these cells metastasize to lymph nodes in athymic nude mice. These tumors appear to have lost bcl-2 expression as compared with the control tumors. In addition, presumably by activation/regulation of topoisomerase II, the heregulin-transfected cells become exquisitely sensitive to doxorubicin and VP-16. Clearly, mechanistic aspects of the erbB-2/4 and heregulin interaction need to be understood from a therapeutic standpoint which could provide additional insights into synergistic treatments for certain patients, or improve treatment regimens for a large number of women. The study of heregulin and its co-expression with erbB-2/4 receptor and the assessment of its involvement in the progression from the in situ stage of breast tumors to the invasive one will additionally increase the relevance of heregulin as a prognostic/diagnostic factor. We believe that our studies provide new insights into breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.",M1

7477375,"Multiple essential functions of neuregulin in development.Neuregulin (also called NDF, <e>heregulin</e>, GGF and ARIA) is a member of the EGF family which induces growth and differentiation of epithelial, glial and muscle cells in culture. The biological effects of the factor are mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors. Neuregulin can bind directly to erbB3 and erbB4 and receptor heterodimerization allows neuregulin-dependent activation of erbB2 (refs 1, 2, 5). A targeted mutation in mice reveals multiple essential roles of neuregulin in development. Here we show that neuregulin -/- embryos die during embryogenesis and display heart malformations. In addition, Schwann cell precursors and cranial ganglia fail to develop normally. The phenotype demonstrates that in vivo neuregulin acts locally and frequently in a paracrine manner. All cell types affected by the mutation express either erbB3 or erbB4, indicating that either of these tyrosine kinase receptors can be a component in recognition and transmission of essential neuregulin signals.",M1
7591267,"Bidirectional interactions between the estrogen receptor and the cerbB-2 signaling pathways: <e>heregulin</e> inhibits estrogenic effects in breast cancer cells.The responsiveness of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer to endocrine therapy is frequently reduced in cells over-expressing c-erbB-2. Stimulation of ER suppresses c-erbB-2, indicating that estrogen controls the activity of c-erbB-2. Heregulin (HRG) has been described to bind to c-erbB-3/c-erbB-4 and to stimulate c-erbB-2. Here we describe the effects of HRG on cell growth and on ER and c-erbB-2 expression in breast cancer cell lines containing distinct levels of c-erbB-2 and ER (BT-474: c-erbB-2 , ER+; MDA-MB-361: c-erbB-2++, ER++; MCF-7: c-erbB-2+, ER ). Proliferation of estrogen-stimulated, c-erbB-2 and ER-positive cells is inhibited by HRG in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, HRG dose-dependently inhibits ER expression. Estrogen, however, inhibits c-erbB-2. Estrogen-mediated down-regulation of c-erbB-2 is most pronounced in MCF-7 but weaker in BT-474. In the latter cells HRG efficiently blocks the estrogenic effect on c-erbB-2. In MCF-7 cells, however, the inhibition of c-erbB-2 cannot be completely reverted by HRG. This modulation occurs in all 3 cell lines at protein, RNA and transcriptional levels, suggesting that the activity of the c-erbB-2 promoter, which contains an estrogen-responsive region, is affected by HRG. The intensity of the mutual inhibition between the HRG/c-erbB-2 and the estrogen/ER system depends on the relative levels of ER and c-erbB-2 expression in the respective cell lines.",M1
7673253,"<e>Heregulin</e> activation of extracellular acidification in mammary carcinoma cells is associated with expression of HER2 and HER3.HER2, the erbB-2/neu proto-oncogene product, is a 185-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Overexpression of HER2 was reported in several human adenocarcinomas, including mammary and ovarian carcinomas. A family of glycoproteins, the heregulin/neu differentiation factors, was characterized and implicated as the ligands for HER2. Recently, it has been shown that HER2 alone is not sufficient to reconstitute high affinity heregulin receptors and that HER3 or HER4 may be the required components of the heregulin receptors on mammary carcinoma cells (Sliwkowski, M.X., Schaefer, G., Akita, R.W., Lofgren, J.A., Fitzpatrick, V.D., Nuijens, A., Fendly, B.M., Cerione, R.A., Vandlen, R.L., and Carraway, K.L., III (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 14661-14665; Plowman, G.D., Green, J.M., Culouscou, J.-M., Carlton, G.W., Rothwell, V.M., and Buckley, W. (1993) Nature 366, 473-475). Using the Cytosensor to measure the extracellular acidification rate, we have examined the effects of recombinant human heregulin-alpha on three mammary carcinoma cell lines expressing HER2 (MDA-MB-453, SK-BR-3, and MCF-7), an ovarian carcinoma cell line expressing HER2 (SK-OV-3), and CHO-K1 and 293-EBNA cells stably transfected with HER2. By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, we found that the breast cells also express HER3 and that the ovarian line co-expresses the HER4 message. A dramatic increase in the acidification rate was observed for the mammary carcinoma cells co-expressing high levels of HER2 and HER3. In contrast, the ovarian cells expressing high levels of HER2 and low levels of HER4 or CHO-K1 and 293-EBNA cells expressing HER2 alone were not responsive to heregulin. When these same transfected cells were exposed to monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody followed by anti-IgG to cause aggregation of the HER2 molecules, an increase in the acidification rate was observed, indicating coupling of transfected HER2 to the signal transduction pathway. Transfection of HER2 into MCF-7 cells, on the other hand, gave 4-fold enhanced acidification responses. These data, together with the previously reported high affinity heregulin binding and activation of tyrosine phosphorylation in HER2 and HER3 co-transfected cells support the role of HER2 and HER3 as components of the heregulin receptor in breast cells.",M1

AR and HRG transcripts were expressed respectively in 58% and 25% of the carcinomas as measured by Northern blot analysis. CR-1 mRNA was found in 77% of the carcinomas using Reverse Transcriptase-PCR analysis. Coexpression of two or three of these peptides was observed in several specimens. There was no significant association between AR, HRG, and CR-1 expression and nodal status, EGF receptor, or c-erbB-2 protooncogene expression in these tumors. However, a significant association between AR expression and estrogen receptor positivity was observed.",M1
7556068,"<e>Heregulin</e>-dependent regulation of HER2/neu oncogenic signaling by heterodimerization with HER3.Amplification and/or overexpression of HER2/neu and HER3 genes have been implicated in the development of cancer in humans. The fact that these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are frequently coexpressed in tumor-derived cell lines and that heterodimers form high affinity binding sites for heregulin (HRG) suggests a novel mechanism for signal definition, diversification or amplification. In cells expressing HER2 and HER3, tyrosine phosphorylation of HER3 is markedly increased upon exposure to recombinant HRG. ATP binding site mutants of HER2 and HER3 demonstrate transphosphorylation of HER3 by HER2, but not vice versa. HRG-induced transphosphorylation of HER3 results in a substrate phosphorylation pattern distinct from HER2 cells and enhances association of the receptor with SHC and phosphoinositol 3-kinase in transfected 293 and mammary carcinoma-derived MCF-7 cells. The physiological relevance of HER2/HER3 heterodimerization is demonstrated by HRG-dependent transformation of NIH 3T3 cells coexpressing the two receptors. These findings demonstrate the acquisition of expanded signaling capacities for HER2 by HRG-induced heterodimerization with HER3 and provide a molecular basis for the involvement of receptor heteroactivation in the development of human malignancies.",M1
7546738,"Neu differentiation factor is a neuron-glia signal and regulates survival, proliferation, and maturation of rat Schwann cell precursors.We show that beta forms of Neu differentiation factor (NDF), homologous to acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity, glial growth factor, and <e>heregulin</e>, prevent apoptotic death and stimulate DNA synthesis of the E14 Schwann cell precursor, an early cell in the rat Schwann cell lineage. When precursors are exposed to NDF in defined medium, they generate Schwann cells without the requirement for DNA synthesis and with a time course that is similar to that with which Schwann cells appear in embryonic nerves in vivo. Furthermore, a neuronal signal that also mediates precursor survival and maturation is blocked by the extracellular domain of the ErbB4 NDF receptor, a protein that specifically blocks the action of NDFs. These observations provide important evidence that NDF is one of the hitherto elusive neuron-glia signaling molecules long proposed to regulate development in the Schwann cell lineage.",M1

With western blots, we have examined the developmental and regional distribution of these receptors within the brain and sciatic nerve of chick embryos. The receptors erb-B2, erb-B3, and erb-B4 are developmentally and spatially regulated within the nervous system.

7642587,"Biosynthetic processing of neu differentiation factor. Glycosylation trafficking, and regulated cleavage from the cell surface.new differentiation factor (NDF), also known as <e>heregulin</e>, is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor family of growth factors; it stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the neu/HER-2 oncogene and causes differentiation of certain human breast cancer cell lines. Alternative splicing of a single gene gives rise to multiple isoforms of NDF/heregulin, as well as the neuronal homologues, designated ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) and GGF (glial growth factor); at least 15 structural variants are known. All but two of the NDF/heregulin cDNAs are predicted to encode transmembrane, glycosylated precursors of soluble NDF. In this report we characterized the biosynthetic processing of different NDF isoforms in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing individual NDF isoforms, and in the native cell line Rat 1-EJ, which expresses at least six different NDF isoforms. We found that the precursors for NDF undergo typical glycosylation and trafficking. A portion of the molecules are proteolytically cleaved intracellularly leading to the constitutive secretion of soluble, mature NDF into the culture media. However, a significant portion of the newly synthesized NDF precursor molecules escape intracellular cleavage and are transported to the cell surface of both transfected and native cells, where they reside as full-length, transmembrane proteins. Finally we show that these full-length, transmembrane NDF molecules can undergo phorbol ester regulated cleavage from the membrane, releasing the soluble growth factor into the medium.",M1
7642563,"<e>Heregulin</e>-stimulated signaling in rat pheochromocytoma cells. Evidence for ErbB3 interactions with Neu/ErbB2 and p85.We have reported that overexpression of Neu leads to heregulin-stimulated neurite outgrowth and the tyrosine-phosphorylation of Neu and other cellular proteins in PC12 cells. Considering that Neu/ErbB2 alone is not able to functionally couple to heregulin, we looked for the possible involvement of ErbB3 in these neurite outgrowth and tyrosine phosphorylation responses. We found that heregulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous ErbB3 protein in PC12 cells and that this phosphorylation, like that of Neu, is greatly enhanced in cells that overexpress Neu. Furthermore, overexpression of ErbB3 in PC12 cells led to heregulin-stimulated neurite extension. In addition to becoming tyrosine-phosphorylated, Neu/ErbB2 and ErbB3 associate with each other, and each associates with the 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in a heregulin-dependent manner. Thus, Neu/ErbB2 and ErbB3 appear to cooperate to mediate the heregulin signal in PC12 cells. Like heregulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF) also stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of both Neu and ErbB3. However, there are clear differences between the EGF- and heregulin-stimulated phosphorylations of ErbB3. In the heregulin response, two tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of ErbB3 are detected. Of these, only the more quickly migrating form (on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) is found to be associated with Neu, whereas the other, more slowly migrating form is uniquely capable of forming stable complexes with p85. In the EGF response, at least two tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of ErbB3 are detected, but these phosphoproteins have distinctly lower apparent molecular weights compared with the heregulin-stimulated ErbB3 phosphoproteins and do not complex with p85. Thus the formation of a stable ErbB3-p85 complex in PC12 cells is a unique outcome of heregulin signaling that correlates with the differences in cell morphology induced by the activated EGF receptor and the Neu tyrosine kinase.",M1
7775601,"Mitogenic activity of neu differentiation factor/<e>heregulin</e> mimics that of epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-I in human mammary epithelial cells.Recently, a family of growth factors has been described that activates erbB-2 receptors. These factors, known as the neu differentiation factors (NDF) or heregulins (HRG), induce tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB-2 receptors as a result of their direct interaction with either erbB-3 or erbB-4 receptors. Although it is known that expression of erbB-2 receptors has relevance in human breast cancer progression, how erbB-2, -3 and -4 receptors regulate mammary epithelial cell proliferation is not known. Therefore, experiments were carried out to study the mitogenic activity of NDF/HRG on the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A which can be cultured continuously under serum-free conditions. MCF-10A cells, like primary cultures of normal human mammary epithelial cells, express an absolute requirement for exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) for growth. The results of these experiments indicate that NDF/HRG can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p185erbB-2 in MCF-10A cells and is mitogenic for these cells. This is consistent with the coexpression of erbB-2 and erbB-3 mRNA that we have observed in MCF-10A cells. In addition, we found that NDF/HRG can substitute for either EGF or IGF-I to stimulate proliferation of these cells. The ability to substitute for both EGF and IGF-I is a unique property of NDF/HRG and is not shared by other members of the EGF or IGF family of growth factors, nor by other factors that we have studied. A striking isoform specificity was also observed which indicated that the beta-isoforms of NDF/HRG were greater than ten times more mitogenic than the alpha-isoforms. We also examined the mitogenic activity of NDF/HRG on MCF-10A cells that overexpress the erbB-2 receptor as a result of infection with a retroviral vector containing the human c-erbB-2 gene (MCF-10AerbB-2 cells). These studies indicated that MCF-10AerbB-2 cells have increased sensitivity to the mitogenic effects of NDF/HRG and that these cells are responsive to the alpha-isoforms of NDF/HRG at physiological concentrations. Thus, NDF/HRG is a dual specificity growth factor for human mammary epithelial cells, and the responsiveness of the cells to NDF/HRG is influenced by the level of expression of erbB-2 receptors.",M1
7759543,"HER4 receptor activation and phosphorylation of Shc proteins by recombinant <e>heregulin</e>-Fc fusion proteins.Heregulins (HRGs) are mosaic glycoproteins that bind to and induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of the HER4/p180erbB4 receptor. This work was aimed at studying the biological effects induced by recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of HRGs as well as identifying intracellular molecules involved in HER4 signaling. To this end, we cloned the EGF-like domains of HRG-alpha, -beta 2, and -beta 3 into a eukaryotic expression vector in frame with sequences encoding a thrombin cleavage site followed by the Fc portion of a human IgG1. These chimeric genes directed the expression of recombinant fusion proteins, rHRGs-T-Fc, which specifically stimulated the phosphorylation of HER4/p180erbB4. We also show that rHRG-alpha-T-Fc bound to human breast cancer cells that express HER4 receptors and induced the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. After thrombin protease cleavage of rHRGs-T-Fc, their EGF-like domains were purified and shown to stimulate protein phosphorylation in HER4-expressing cells. Moreover, the rHRG-beta 2 EGF-like domain markedly induced the phosphorylation of Shc proteins on tyrosine, suggesting a role for these adaptor molecules in HRG-mediated signaling.",M1
7755620,"Bioactive synthetic peptide of NDF/<e>heregulin</e>.A folded synthetic peptide analog of NDF (NDF5), which has the 52 amino acid EGF-like domain of NDF alpha 2, has been characterized. The folded peptide stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Her2, Her3 and Her4 in breast cancer cells and competes with low affinity with full-length NDF alpha 2 for binding to the cells, while the linear one does not. NDF5 also induces morphologic changes in breast cancer cells. After several days treatment with NDF5 or NDF alpha 2, Her2-transfected MCF7 cells (Her2/MCF7) became similar morphologically to non-transfected MCF7. The biological activity of NDF5 is between 1/10 and 1/100 that of NDF alpha 2. This suggests that other motifs, such as the Ig and spacer domains may be important elements in conferring full activity.",M1
7538656,"Cooperative signaling of ErbB3 and ErbB2 in neoplastic transformation and human mammary carcinomas.In the present study we demonstrate that erbB-3 and erbB-2 cooperate in neoplastic transformation. Under conditions in which neither gene alone induced transformation, they readily transformed NIH3T3 cells if co-expressed. Furthermore, at high expression levels of ErbB2 which cause transformation, ErbB3 enhanced focus formation by one order of magnitude. Synergy required an intact ErbB2 extracellular domain and tyrosine kinase activity. Cooperation between ErbB3 and ErbB2 involved heterodimerization and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3. Signaling by the heterodimer resulted in increased PI 3-kinase recruitment as well as quantitative and qualitative differences in substrate phosphorylation. Evidence for signaling by an active ErbB3-ErbB2 heterodimer in four mammary tumor cell lines indicated relevance of this mechanism for human neoplasia. Our detection of the NDF/<e>heregulin</e> transcript in NIH3T3 cells implicates an autocrine loop involving this ligand in signaling by the ErbB3-ErbB2 heterodimer in the model system, whereas heregulin-independent mechanisms likely exist for cooperative signaling by ErbB3 and ErbB2 chronically activated in some human mammary carcinomas.",M1
7730382,"Neu differentiation factor inhibits EGF binding. A model for trans-regulation within the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases.Neu differentiation factor (NDF, or <e>heregulin</e>) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are structurally related proteins that bind to distinct members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Here we show that NDF inhibits EGF binding in a cell type-specific manner. The inhibitory effect is distinct from previously characterized mechanisms that involve protein kinase C and receptor internalization because it occurred at 4 degrees C and displayed reversibility. The extent of inhibition correlated with both receptor saturation and affinity of different NDF isoforms, and it was abolished upon overexpression of either EGF receptor or ErbB-2. Binding kinetics and equilibrium analyses indicated that NDF reduced the affinity, rather than the number, of EGF receptors, through an acceleration of the rate of ligand dissociation and deceleration of the association rate. On the basis of co-immunoprecipitation of EGF and NDF receptors, we attribute the inhibitory effect to the formation of receptor heterodimers. According to this model, EGF binding to NDF-occupied heterodimers is partially blocked. This model of negative trans-regulation within the ErbB family is relevant to other subgroups of receptor tyrosine kinases and may have physiological implications.",M1
7731691,"ErbB-3 mediates differential mitogenic effects of NDF/<e>heregulin</e> isoforms on mouse keratinocytes.The family of Neu differentiation factors (NDFs, or heregulins) includes a dozen secreted glycoproteins, whose receptor binding domain displays two variants, alpha and beta, and they bind to two receptor tyrosine kinases, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4. Certain isoforms were reported to induce growth-arrest and differentiation of mammary tumor cells, while other breast cancer cell lines responded mitogenically. The present study addressed the biologic effects of various NDF isoforms on normal EGF-dependent epithelial cells, Balb/MK keratinocytes, that can undergo either proliferation or differentiation. We found that beta isoforms of NDF induced a mitogenic effect, that was significantly smaller than the maximal response to EGF. By contrast with NDF-beta, NDF-alpha isoforms exerted almost no mitogenic effect, but they were sufficient to maintain keratinocytes in culture. Consistent with their higher mitogenic potency, NDF-beta isoforms bound to Balb/MK cells with higher affinity (Kd = 2.2 nM) than alpha isoforms, however both groups shared their receptor, that we identified as ErbB-3. No transcript of ErbB-4 was detectable in the keratinocytes, but these cells express multiple NDF mRNAs and also ErbB-2. We conclude that different isoforms of NDF induce distinct growth regulatory effects on cultured keratinocytes, through direct interaction with ErbB-3.",M1
7535774,"HER4 expression correlates with cytotoxicity directed by a <e>heregulin</e>-toxin fusion protein.We have constructed, expressed, and purified a fusion protein, HAR-TX beta 2, consisting of heregulin-beta 2 fused to a binding-defective form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, PE40. The fusion protein was found to induce receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in CEM cells transfected with HER4 alone or in combination with HER2 but not in cells transfected with HER2 or HER1 alone. The phosphorylation of receptor tyrosines was both dose-dependent and saturable in amounts similar to those shown to be active for native heregulin. HAR-TX beta 2 was specifically cytotoxic toward a variety of carcinoma cell lines in the ng/ml range. However, some tumor cell lines were found to be insensitive to the cytotoxic action of the fusion protein even at &gt; 2 micrograms/ml. Relative amounts of HER4, HER3, and HER2 were determined on seven cell lines sensitive and four cell lines insensitive to HAR-TX beta 2. All lines that express HER4 were killed by HAR-TX beta 2, while none lacking HER4 were affected. HAR-TX beta 2 was able to bind to and signal via tyrosine phosphorylation in cell lines that co-express HER2 and HER3 in the absence of HER4 without inducing cytotoxicity. Thus HAR-TX beta 2 may prove to be a useful reagent for the targeting and elimination of HER4-positive tumor cells.",M1
7860149,"Targeted inhibition of tumor-cell growth by recombinant <e>heregulin</e>-toxin fusion proteins.Fusion of functional domains of proteins by in vitro recombination of gene fragments can be used to generate novel anti-tumor agents. The combination of tumor-cell-recognition functions and toxic functions results in cytotoxic molecules with a high specificity for tumor cells. Human adenocarcinomas are frequently characterized by over-expression of members of the epidermal-growth-factor (EGF) receptor family (ErbB-1, 2, 3 and 4), when compared with normal cells. These tumors are particularly suited to treatment with recombinant toxins. The human heregulins (HRG) and their rat counterparts (neu differentiation factor, NDF) have been identified as ligands for these receptors. Two chimeric heregulin-toxin fusions consisting of the EGF-like receptor recognition domain of the heregulin isoforms HRG alpha and HRG beta I, and the domains II, Ib and III of the Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA) were constructed. HRG beta I-ETA is highly cytotoxic for the mammary carcinoma cell lines SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-453. HRG alpha-ETA was less active than HRG beta I-ETA. The killing activity of the recombinant toxins correlated with the expression levels of ErbB-3 and/or ErbB-4 in the cell lines studied. High expression of ErbB-2 is not sufficient to confer sensitivity towards the HRG-ETA. Treatment of mice with 0.4 mg/kg/day of HRG beta I-ETA caused growth retardation of transplanted human breast tumor cells. Higher levels of HRG beta I-ETA administration resulted in acute hemorrhagic necrosis of the liver.",M1
7824269,"NDF/<e>heregulin</e> activates MAP kinase and p70/p85 S6 kinase during proliferation or differentiation of mammary epithelial cells.Neu differentiation factors (NDF) are a novel family of polypeptide factors which activate sub-class I tyrosine kinase receptors. In all mammary epithelial cells analysed in this study, NDF activates the same signalling pathways while it induces different, cell-specific biological effects. In AU565 cells which are growth inhibited, as well as in T47D or HC11 cells which proliferate in response to NDF, the MAP kinase isoforms p44ERK1 and p42ERK2 and the p70/p85 S6 kinase are activated. NDF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation and the in vitro kinase activity of ErbB-2. When PKC is activated by TPA, NDF is no longer able to activate ErbB-2 in T47D cells, leading to a blockage of cell proliferation. Activation of ErbB-2 by point mutation, or by monoclonal antibodies, also stimulates both the MAPK and the p70/p85 S6 kinase pathways. The same monoclonal antibodies can induce AU565 cell differentiation. In summary, during growth or differentiation of mammary epithelial cells, NDF stimulates several independent signalling pathways which can also be triggered by ErbB-2 stimulation alone. PKC activation blocks the biological effect induced by NDF through negative modulation of ErbB-2.",M1
7760847,"Neu differentiation factor/<e>heregulin</e> modulates growth and differentiation of HC11 mammary epithelial cells.The HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cell line has proven to be a valuable in vitro model to study the roles of peptide factors and hormones involved in the growth and differentiation of mammary cells. Treatment of HC11 cells with the lactogenic hormones, dexamethasone, insulin, and PRL (DIP), leads to cellular differentiation and production of the milk protein beta-casein. We have analyzed the effects of Neu differentiation factor (NDF)/heregulin, a newly described activating ligand for erbB-2 and other members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family, on cell growth and the expression of milk proteins in HC11 cells. In these cells, NDF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB-2 and erbB-3. Both NDF and EGF stimulate HC11 cell proliferation and promote the responsiveness of HC11 cells to lactogenic hormones. NDF induces the expression of a 22-kilodalton milk protein. This protein is up-regulated by other factors, including dexamethasone, EGF, and basic fibroblast growth factor, and is controlled in a manner distinct from that of beta-casein. Like EGF, NDF inhibits the DIP-induced expression of beta-casein at the level of transcription. The inhibition is due to the negative effect of NDF on the activation of mammary gland factor (MGF/Stat5), a member of the Stat family of transcription factors, which is essential for beta-casein gene expression.",M1
7929212,"ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 function as the respective low and high affinity receptors of all Neu differentiation factor/<e>heregulin</e> isoforms.Neu differentiation factor (NDF or heregulin) elevates tyrosine phosphorylation of the ErbB-2 receptor tyrosine kinase, and it was, therefore, thought to function as a ligand of this receptor. However, several lines of evidence raised the possibility that the interaction between NDF and ErbB-2 involves another molecule, which belongs to the family of epidermal growth factor receptors. To address this question we constructed soluble chimeric proteins between alkaline phosphatase and the extracellular domains of ErbB-2 and either ErbB-3 or ErbB-4, two newly recognized members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. Using the soluble proteins we found that beta isoforms of NDF specifically bind to the ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 receptors but not to the soluble ErbB-2 protein. When ectopically expressed in monkey fibroblasts, the full-length ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 receptors conferred specific binding to NDF. In these cells ErbB-3 displayed lower ligand binding affinity than ErbB-4, but like the latter receptor it preferred to bind the beta isoform over the alpha class of NDFs. These results indicate that both ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 function as physiological receptors of all NDF isoforms and suggest that a still unknown ligand of ErbB-2 exists.",M1
7942609,"Expression of the erbB-2 family of growth factor receptors and their ligands in breast cancers. Implication for tumor biology and clinical behavior.Transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases that bind to growth factors transmit signals that are essential to growth and differentiation. These receptors can be classified into groups based on their structure. One group implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer contains receptors belonging to the erbB family. This group includes the epidermal growth factor receptors, the HER-2/neu (erbB-2), HER-3, and HER-4. Despite the structural similarity of these receptors, HER-2/neu, HER-4, and HER-3 do not bind to any ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor. However, a 44-kD glycoprotein called neu differentiation factor (neu differentiation factor/<e>heregulin</e>) has been isolated. This ligand phosphorylates the HER-2/neu receptor and binds directly to HER-4 and HER-3. The abundance of erbB receptors and their ligands in breast cancers points to their functional importance in the pathogenesis and biological behavior of breast cancers. Furthermore, these receptors and ligands may hold a promise for targeted therapy for breast cancer in the future.",M1
7937775,"Brain neurons and glial cells express Neu differentiation factor/<e>heregulin</e>: a survival factor for astrocytes.Neu differentiation factor (NDF, also called heregulin) was isolated from mesenchymal cells on the basis of its ability to elevate phosphorylation of ErbB proteins. Earlier in situ hybridization analysis showed that NDF was transcribed predominantly in the central nervous system during embryonic development. To gain insights into the role of NDF in brain we analyzed its distribution by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Late-gestation (day 17) rat embryos displayed high NDF immunoreactivity in both motor (e.g., putamen) and limbic (e.g., septum) regions. Lower levels of the factor were exhibited by adult brain, except for the cerebellum, where NDF expression was increased postnatally. Both neurons and glial cells were identified by immunohistochemistry as NDF-producing cells (e.g., pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex and glial cells in the corpus callosum). By establishment of primary cultures of rat brain cells we confirmed that NDF was expressed in neurons as well as in astrocytes. In addition, by using such primary cultures we observed that NDF treatment exerted only a limited mitogenic effect, which was accompanied by significant acceleration of astrocyte maturation. Furthermore, long-term incubation with the factor specifically protected astrocytes from apoptosis, implying that NDF functions in brain as a survival and maturation factor for astrocytes.",M1

This and the low incidence of amplification suggest that HGL is not the key gene of the 8p12 amplification but may be used as a marker of large amplification units.",M1
8062828,"Solution structure of the epidermal growth factor-like domain of <e>heregulin</e>-alpha, a ligand for p180erbB-4.p185erbB-2 and p180erbB-4 are epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-like tyrosine kinases, whose co-expression is observed in many breast carcinomas. Heregulins (HRGs), which contain an immunoglobulin unit and an EGF-like domain, bind to p180erbB-4 and activate p180erbB-4 and p185erbB-2 through transphosphorylation or receptor heterodimerization. The EGF-like domain is sufficient for the activation. Despite the sequence similarity, no cross activity is seen between the p180erbB-4 ligands (HRGs) and the p170erbB-1 ligands [EGF and transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha]. To investigate the structural basis of receptor specificity, we have determined the solution structure of the EGF-like domain of HRG-alpha by two-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations. Though its main-chain fold is similar to those of EGF and TGF-alpha, distinctive structural features are observed on the molecular surface including an ionic cluster and hydrophobic patches, which afford HRG-alpha the specific affinity for p180erbB-4. The structure should provide a basis for the structure-activity relationship of HRGs and for the design of drugs which prevent progression of breast cancer.",M1

Acad. Sci. USA 86, 9193-9197; (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 4905-4909]. The natural ligand for Her3 has not been identified. Although recently NDF has been proposed as a specific ligand for Her4 [(1993) Nature 366, 473-475; (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 18407-18410], we report here that Her3 was phosphorylated on tyrosine not only in three breast carcinoma cell lines, MDAMB453, MDAMB468 and SKBR3, but also in Her3-transfected CHO cells in response to NDF stimulation. In further studies, cells were reacted with 125I-labeled NDF and then chemically crosslinked. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Her3 revealed a dense high Mw band, greater than 400 kDa. The results suggest that NDF may be a ligand of Her3 and induces receptor hetero-oligomerization.",M1
7912564,"Epidermal growth factor-related peptides in the pathogenesis of human breast cancer.A number of different epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related peptides such as EGF, transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha), amphiregulin (AR), <e>heregulin</e> (HRG), and cripto-1 (CR-1), are coexpressed to varying degrees in both normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells. However, in general the frequency and level of expression of TGF alpha, AR, and CR-1 are higher in malignant breast epithelial cells than in normal mammary epithelium. In addition, several of these peptides such as TGF alpha and AR can function as autocrine and/or juxtacrine growth factors in mammary epithelial cells, and their expression is stringently regulated by mammotrophic hormones such as estrogens, activated proto-oncogenes that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, and other growth factors. The redundancy of expression that is observed for a number of these structurally related peptides in both normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells suggests that some of these peptides may be involved in regulating other aspects of cellular behavior such as differentiation in addition to proliferation.",M1
7902537,"<e>Heregulin</e> induces tyrosine phosphorylation of HER4/p180erbB4.The HER4/ERBB4 gene encodes a 180K transmembrane protein (HER4/p180erbB4) that is structurally related to the 185K product (HER2/p185erbB2) of the HER2/ERBB2 proto-oncogene. A 45K heparin-binding glycoprotein (p45) has been characterized that specifically activates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of HER4 (ref. 2). This HER4 ligand shares several features with the heregulin family of proteins, including molecular mass, ability to induce differentiation of breast cancer cells, activation of tyrosine phosphorylation in MDA-MB453 cells, and amino-terminal protein sequence. Heregulin exists as multiple isoforms and all are presumed to interact directly with HER2 (refs 3-6). We have used binding and phosphorylation studies with recombinant ligand on cell lines expressing recombinant receptors, and report here that heregulin, like p45, is a specific ligand for HER4. Furthermore, heregulin fails to induce phosphorylation of HER2 in the absence of HER4. These findings suggest that activation of the HER4 receptor is involved in signal transduction by heregulin.",M1
7908191,"Neu and its ligands: from an oncogene to neural factors.Transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases that bind to peptide factors transmit essential growth and differentiation signals. A growing list of orphan receptors, of which some are oncogenic, holds the promise that many unknown ligands may be discovered by tracking the corresponding surface molecules. The neu gene (also called erbB-2 and HER-2) encodes such a receptor tyrosine kinase whose oncogenic potential is released in the developing rodent nervous system through a point mutation. Amplification and overexpression of neu are thought to contribute to malignancy of certain human adenocarcinomas. The search for soluble factors that interact with the Neu receptor led to the discovery of a 44 kDa glycoprotein that induces phenotypic differentiation of cultured mammary tumor cells to growth-arrested and milk-producing cells. The Neu differentiation factor (NDF or <e>heregulin</e>), however, also acts as a mitogen for epithelial, Schwann and glial cells. Multiple forms of the factor are produced by alternative splicing and their expression is confined predominantly to the central and to the peripheral nervous systems. One identified neuronal function of this family of polypeptides is to control the formation of neuromuscular junctions, but their physiological role in secretory epithelia is still unknown. Other open questions relate to the transmembrane topology of various precursors, the identity of a putative coreceptor, the possible existence of additional ligands of Neu and the functional significance of the interaction between Neu and at least three highly related receptor tyrosine kinases.",M1
8106145,"Neu differentiation factor (<e>heregulin</e>) induces expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1: implications for mammary tumors.Neu differentiation factor (NDF, also called heregulin) is a 44-kilodalton glycoprotein that stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the Neu/HER-2 receptor and induces phenotypic differentiation of certain mammary cancer cell lines to growth-arrested and milk-producing cells. To determine which molecules participate in the concomitant morphological alterations, we analyzed the expression of several cytoskeletal and surface molecules and found that NDF elevated the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in cultured AU-565 human adenocarcinoma cells. The levels of both the protein and the mRNA of ICAM-1 were elevated after 3-5 days of treatment with NDF. Elevated expression of ICAM-1 was induced also by gamma-interferon and by the tumor-promoting phorbol ester (PMA), albeit with different kinetics. Down-regulation of protein kinase C or its inhibition by calphostin C partially inhibited the effect of NDF, implying that the induction of ICAM-1 may be mediated by protein kinase C. NDF transcripts were detectable in 3 of 9 human mammary tumors, suggesting that the in vitro effect of the factor may be relevant to breast cancer. By selecting Neu-positive human mammary tumors (n = 39), we found a significant correlation (P &lt; 0.001) between the expression of ICAM-1 and histological features of invasive ductal carcinoma with a prominent carcinoma in situ component. When cultured in vitro the cells of these tumors grew in clusters and formed domelike structures reminiscent of comedo-type carcinoma in situ. In addition, the majority of patients with tumors that coexpressed ICAM-1 and Neu had no lymph node involvement, unlike most Neu-positive but ICAM-1-negative tumors, which metastasized to the lymphatic system. Taken together, our observations suggest that the induction of ICAM-1 by NDF may affect the morphology, differentiation state, and metastasis of Neu-expressing mammary tumor cells.",M1
7689552,"Characterization of a breast cancer cell differentiation factor that specifically activates the HER4/p180erbB4 receptor.We recently reported the molecular cloning of HER4/p180erbB4, a new member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, as well as its activation by a partially purified ligand (Plowman, G. D., Culouscou, J.-M., Whitney, G. S., Green, J. M., Carlton, G. W., Foy, L., Neubauer, M. G., and Shoyab, M. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 1746-1750). In this report we describe the purification to homogeneity of a 45-kDa protein (p45) that induces the differentiation of MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells and stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of p180erbB4, the HER4-encoded protein. Hydrophobic interaction, ion-exchange, heparin, and size exclusion chromatographies were used to purify this p180erbB4 activator to homogeneity. N-terminal amino acid sequencing suggests that p45 is related to <e>heregulin</e>, a recently reported ligand for p185erbB2.

A 44 kDa glycoprotein that elevates tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu has been isolated and named Neu differentiation factor (NDF), or heregulin. Here we show that NDF affects tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu in human tumor cells of breast, colon and neuronal origin, but not in ovarian cells that overexpress the receptor. By using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to Neu, we found that the ovarian receptor is immunologically and biochemically similar to the mammary p185neu. Nevertheless, unlike breast-derived Neu, the ovarian protein did not display covalent cross-linking to radiolabeled NDF, and was devoid of ligand-induced association with phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase. Direct binding analysis showed that NDF binds with high affinity (Kd approximately 10(-9) M) to mammary cells, but its weak association with ovarian cells is probably mediated by heparin-like molecules. Similar to the endogenous receptor, the ectopically overexpressed Neu of mammary cells, but not of ovarian and fibroblastic cells, exhibited elevated levels of NDF-induced phosphorylation and covalent cross-linking of the radiolabeled factor. Taken together, our results imply that NDF binding to cells requires both Neu and an additional cellular component, whose identity is still unknown, but its tissue distribution is more restricted than the expression of the neu gene.",M1

In vitro NDF promotes differentiation of certain mammary tumor cell lines to milk-producing cells. As a first step toward understanding the physiological role of NDF, we performed in situ hybridization analyses to determine mRNA distribution in the mouse embryo and to map the gene to human karyotypes. In 14.5-day-postcoitum mouse embryos, NDF expression is confined predominantly to the central and peripheral nervous system, including the neuroepithelium that lines the lateral ventricles of the brain, the ventral horn of the spinal cord, and the intestinal as well as dorsal root ganglia. Other tissues that contain NDF transcripts are the adrenal gland, liver, and distinct cell layers of the dermis and germinal ridge. In situ hybridization of a 3H-labeled probe to human metaphase spreads localized the NDF gene to the short arm of chromosome 8 at bands p12-p21.",M1

A 45-kilodalton protein heregulin-alpha (HRG-alpha) that specifically induced phosphorylation of p185erbB2 was purified from the conditioned medium of a human breast tumor cell line. Several complementary DNA clones encoding related HRGs were identified, all of which are similar to proteins in the epidermal growth factor family. Scatchard analysis of the binding of recombinant HRG to a breast tumor cell line expressing p185erbB2 showed a single high affinity binding site [dissociation constant (Kd) = 105 +/- 15 picomolar]. Heregulin transcripts were identified in several normal tissues and cancer cell lines. The HRGs may represent the natural ligands for p185erbB2.",M1
20424164,"Fatty acid-binding protein 5 and PPARbeta/delta are critical mediators of epidermal growth factor receptor-induced carcinoma cell growth.Epidermal growth factors and their receptors (EGFRs) promote breast cancer cell proliferation and can drive tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate these effects are incompletely understood. We previously showed that mammary tumor development in the mouse model of breast cancer MMTV-neu, a model characterized by amplification of the EGFR ErbB2 in mammary tissue, correlates with a marked up-regulation of fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5). FABP5 functions to deliver ligands to and enhance the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta), a receptor whose target genes include genes involved in cell growth and survival. We show here that in MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells, EGFR signaling directly up-regulates the expression of FABP5. The data demonstrate that treatment of these cells with the EGFR ligand <e>heregulin</e>-beta1 signals through the ERK and the phophatidylinositol-3-kinase cascades, resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. In turn, NF-kappaB induces the expression of FABP5 through two cognate response elements in the promoter of this gene. The observations further demonstrate that FABP5 and PPARbeta/delta are critical mediators of the ability of EGFR to enhance cell proliferation, indicating that this transcriptional pathway plays a key role in EGFR-induced tumorigenesis. Additional observations indicate that the expression of FABP5 is down-regulated by the Krüppel-like factor KLF2, suggesting a tumor suppressor activity for this factor.",M2
20363754,"Protein kinase D controls actin polymerization and cell motility through phosphorylation of cortactin.We here identify protein kinase D (PKD) as an upstream regulator of the F-actin-binding protein cortactin and the Arp actin polymerization machinery. PKD phosphorylates cortactin in vitro and in vivo at serine 298 thereby generating a 14-3-3 binding motif. In vitro, a phosphorylation-deficient cortactin-S298A protein accelerated VCA-Arp-cortactin-mediated synergistic actin polymerization and showed reduced F-actin binding, indicative of enhanced turnover of nucleation complexes. In vivo, cortactin co-localized with the nucleation promoting factor WAVE2, essential for lamellipodia extension, in the actin polymerization zone in <e>Heregulin</e>-treated MCF-7 cells. Using a 3-dye FRET-based approach we further demonstrate that WAVE2-Arp and cortactin prominently interact at these structures. Accordingly, cortactin-S298A significantly enhanced lamellipodia extension and directed cell migration. Our data thus unravel a previously unrecognized mechanism by which PKD controls cancer cell motility.",M2
20215504,"An ErbB3 antibody, MM-121, is active in cancers with ligand-dependent activation.ErbB3 is a critical activator of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ErbB1), ErbB2 [human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)], and [hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET)] addicted cancers, and reactivation of ErbB3 is a prominent method for cancers to become resistant to ErbB inhibitors. In this study, we evaluated the in vivo efficacy of a therapeutic anti-ErbB3 antibody, MM-121. We found that MM-121 effectively blocked ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3 induced by either EGFR, HER2, or MET. Assessment of several cancer cell lines revealed that MM-121 reduced basal ErbB3 phosphorylation most effectively in cancers possessing ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. In those cancers, MM-121 treatment led to decreased ErbB3 phosphorylation and, in some instances, decreased ErbB3 expression. The efficacy of single-agent MM-121 was also examined in xenograft models. A machine learning algorithm found that MM-121 was most effective against xenografts with evidence of ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. We subsequently investigated whether MM-121 treatment could abrogate resistance to anti-EGFR therapies by preventing reactivation of ErbB3. We observed that an EGFR mutant lung cancer cell line (HCC827), made resistant to gefitinib by exogenous <e>heregulin</e>, was resensitized by MM-121. In addition, we found that a de novo lung cancer mouse model induced by EGFR T790M-L858R rapidly became resistant to cetuximab. Resistance was associated with an increase in heregulin expression and ErbB3 activation. However, concomitant cetuximab treatment with MM-121 blocked reactivation of ErbB3 and resulted in a sustained and durable response. Thus, these results suggest that targeting ErbB3 with MM-121 can be an effective therapeutic strategy for cancers with ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3.",M2
20028979,"Activation of the Ran GTPase is subject to growth factor regulation and can give rise to cellular transformation.Although the small GTPase Ran is best known for its roles in nucleocytoplasmic transport, mitotic spindle assembly, and nuclear envelope formation, recent studies have demonstrated the overexpression of Ran in multiple tumor types and that its expression is correlated with a poor patient prognosis, providing evidence for the importance of this GTPase in cell growth regulation. Here we show that Ran is subject to growth factor regulation by demonstrating that it is activated in a serum-dependent manner in human breast cancer cells and, in particular, in response to <e>heregulin</e>, a growth factor that activates the Neu/ErbB2 tyrosine kinase. The heregulin-dependent activation of Ran requires mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and stimulates the capped RNA binding capability of the cap-binding complex in the nucleus, thus influencing gene expression at the level of mRNA processing. We further demonstrate that the excessive activation of Ran has important consequences for cell growth by showing that a novel, activated Ran mutant is sufficient to transform NIH-3T3 cells in an mTOR- and epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent manner and that Ran-transformed cells form tumors in mice.",M2
19925682,"Ligand-specific sequential regulation of transcription factors for differentiation of MCF-7 cells.BACKGROUND: Sharing a common ErbB/HER receptor signaling pathway, <e>heregulin</e> (HRG) induces differentiation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells while epidermal growth factor (EGF) elicits proliferation. Although cell fates resulting from action of the aforementioned ligands completely different, the respective gene expression profiles in early transcription are qualitatively similar, suggesting that gene expression during late transcription, but not early transcription, may reflect ligand specificity. In this study, based on both the data from time-course quantitative real-time PCR on over 2,000 human transcription factors and microarray of all human genes, we identified a series of transcription factors which may control HRG-specific late transcription in MCF-7 cells. RESULTS: We predicted that four transcription factors including EGR4, FRA-1, FHL2, and DIPA should have responsibility of regulation in MCF-7 cell differentiation. Validation analysis suggested that one member of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family, FOSL-1 (FRA-1 gene), appeared immediately following c-FOS expression, might be responsible for expression of transcription factor FHL2 through activation of the AP-1 complex. Furthermore, RNAi gene silencing of FOSL-1 and FHL2 resulted in increase of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation of which duration was sustained by HRG stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicated that a time-dependent transcriptional regulatory network including c-FOS, FRA-1, and FHL2 is vital in controlling the ERK signaling pathway through a negative feedback loop for MCF-7 cell differentiation.",M2

This hinge-tagged design minimized the molecular weight to approximately 50% of the conventional Fc-fusion design without an Fc domain of IgG. The refolded dimers could be easily analyzed and characterized by SDS-PAGE. Hinge-tagged soluble ErbBs demonstrated significant affinity for betacellulin and <e>heregulin</e>.

19797898,"<e>Heregulin</e>-induced VEGF expression via the ErbB3 signaling pathway in colon cancer.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Heregulin (HRG/NRG) ligation to erbB3/4 promotes their respective heterodimerization with erbB2, and consequent erbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Although HRG has been shown to be expressed in a variety of cancer tissues, its expression and role in colon cancer have yet to be clarified. We therefore examined the link between the expression of these erbB receptors, and the relationship between HRG and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in colon cancer. METHODS: We analyzed the effects of HRG on VEGF secretion in 6 colorectal cancer cell lines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and HRG-induced p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85 PI-3K), Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) activation in Caco-2 colon cancer cell lines by Western blot. We also examined HRG and VEGF mRNA expression in 16 colon cancer biopsy samples by real-time PCR. The localization of HRG and VEGF protein expression in colon cancer tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Exogenous HRG stimulated VEGF secretion in all cell lines examined, and VEGF mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells. HRG also activated p85 PI-3K, Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK. VEGF secretion was inhibited by both specific p38 MAPK inhibitor and proteasome inhibitor that inhibit nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation. In colon cancer biopsy samples, HRG mRNA expression correlated with VEGF mRNA expression. HRG immunoreactivity was observed both in cancer cells and in mesenchymal cells in colon cancer tissues. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that HRG might affect colon cancer growth by regulating VEGF secretion via the erbB3 signaling pathway through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms.",M2
19737968,"Modulation of HER3 is a marker of dynamic cell signaling in ovarian cancer: implications for pertuzumab sensitivity.This study was designed to evaluate the expression of HER receptors as a marker of sensitivity to the humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody pertuzumab in ovarian cancer cells. In a recent clinical trial, low levels of HER3 mRNA have been shown to associate with pertuzumab response when combined with gemcitabine. We sought to define how pertuzumab modulated HER expression levels in ovarian cancer using cell line models to better understand differential and dynamic receptor expression in therapeutic response. Changes in HER3 mRNA expression were also assessed in pertuzumab-treated xenografts. HER3 mRNA and, to a lesser extent, HER2, were down-regulated after stimulation both with <e>heregulin</e>-beta1 and epidermal growth factor in a range of ovarian cancer cell lines either growth sensitive or growth resistant to pertuzumab. Pertuzumab reversed this down-regulation and the magnitude of the reversal correlated with pertuzumab sensitivity. The change in HER3 mRNA expression correlated inversely to how much the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways were dynamically activated with stimulation. Finally, up-regulation of HER3 mRNA was found in cancer xenografts treated with pertuzumab. We conclude that HER3 mRNA is down-regulated by both heregulin-beta1 and epidermal growth factor activation. This suggests that in some tumors, low HER3 mRNA expression is driven by, or dependent on, growth factor. HER3 mRNA expression is effectively reversed in pertuzumab-sensitive tumors. These data are consistent with low HER3 mRNA identifying a pertuzumab-sensitive phenotype.",M2
19644050,"Preventive effects of <e>heregulin</e>-beta1 on macrophage foam cell formation and atherosclerosis.RATIONALE: Human heregulins, neuregulin-1 type I polypeptides that activate proliferation, differentiation, and survival of glial cells, neurons, and myocytes, are expressed in macrophage foam cells within human coronary atherosclerotic lesions. Macrophage foam cell formation, characterized by cholesterol ester accumulation, is modulated by scavenger receptor class A (SR-A), acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)1, and ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC)A1. OBJECTIVE: The present study clarified the roles of heregulins in macrophage foam cell formation and atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma heregulin-beta(1) levels were significantly decreased in 31 patients with acute coronary syndrome and 33 patients with effort angina pectoris compared with 34 patients with mild hypertension and 40 healthy volunteers (1.3+/-0.3, 2.0+/-0.4 versus 7.6+/-1.4, 8.2+/-1.2 ng/mL; P&lt;0.01). Among all patients with acute coronary syndrome and effort angina pectoris, plasma heregulin-beta(1) levels were further decreased in accordance with the severity of coronary artery lesions. Expression of heregulin-beta(1) was observed at trace levels in intracoronary atherothrombosis obtained by aspiration thrombectomy from acute coronary syndrome patients. Heregulin-beta(1), but not heregulin-alpha, significantly reduced acetylated low-density lipoprotein-induced cholesterol ester accumulation in primary cultured human monocyte-derived macrophages by reducing SR-A and ACAT1 expression and by increasing ABCA1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Heregulin-beta(1) significantly decreased endocytic uptake of [(125)I]acetylated low-density lipoprotein and ACAT activity, and increased cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein (Apo)A-I from human macrophages. Chronic infusion of heregulin-beta(1) into ApoE(-/-) mice significantly suppressed the development of atherosclerotic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided the first evidence that heregulin-beta(1) inhibits atherogenesis and suppresses macrophage foam cell formation via SR-A and ACAT1 downregulation and ABCA1 upregulation.",M2
19525980,"The Ste20-like kinase SLK is required for ErbB2-driven breast cancer cell motility.The Ste20-like kinase, SLK, is involved in the control of cell motility through its effects on actin reorganization and focal adhesion turnover. Here we investigated the role of SLK in chemotaxis downstream of the tyrosine kinase receptor, HER2/ErbB2/Neu, which is frequently overexpressed in human breast cancers. Our results show that SLK is required for the efficient cell migration of human and mouse mammary epithelial cell lines in the presence of the Neu activator, <e>heregulin</e>, as a chemoattractant. SLK activity is stimulated by heregulin treatment or by overexpression of activated Neu. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 1201 or tyrosines 1226/7 on Neu is a key event for SLK activation and cell migration, and cancer cell invasion mediated by these tyrosines is inhibited by kinase-inactive SLK. Signaling pathway inhibitors show that Neu-mediated SLK activation is dependent on MEK, PI3K, PLCgamma and Shc signaling. Furthermore, heregulin-stimulated SLK activity requires signals from the focal adhesion proteins, FAK and src. Finally, phospho-FAK analysis shows that SLK is required for Neu-dependent focal adhesion turnover. Together, these studies define an interaction between Neu and SLK signaling in the regulation of cancer cell motility.",M2
19497323,"Study of inhibition effect of herceptin on interaction between <e>heregulin</e> and erbB receptors HER3/HER2 by single-molecule force spectroscopy.Herceptin is a monoclonal antibody against HER2, which is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB) family and is overexpressed in many cancers. In this work, we have applied single-molecule force spectroscopy to study the effect of Herceptin on HER2 modulated ligand-receptor interaction for ErbB signaling in living cells. Heregulin beta1 (HRG), the specific ligand of HER3, was used for HER2 activation as HER3 is the preferable dimerization partner of HER2 and HER3/HER2 is the most representative heterodimer found in cancer. Our results demonstrated a more stable binding of HRG to the cells co-expressing HER3 and HER2 than those expressing HER3 alone. Moreover, the binding force of Herceptin and HER2 is as strong as that of HRG and HER3/HER2. With the addition of Herceptin, the binding strength of HRG to the cells co-expressing HER3 and HER2 decreased. The presence of Herceptin changed the dynamic force spectrum of HRG-HER3/HER2 to that similar to HRG-HER3. Therefore, the enhancement in HRG-HER3 binding after recruiting HER2 was inhibited by Herceptin. The method offers a new approach to study the molecular mechanism of Herceptin anti-cancer effect.",M2

(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in green tea inhibits the metastasis of some cancer cell lines. Cell migration/invasion assays using Boyden chambers demonstrated that (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), another green tea catechin, inhibited heregulin-beta1 (HRG)-induced migration/invasion of MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells to approximately the same extent as EGCG. Assays of cytoskeletal reorganization, Western blotting and immunoprecipitation suggested that EGCG inhibited this migration/invasion by suppressing the HRG-stimulated activation of epidermal growth factor receptor-related protein B2 (ErbB2)/ErbB3/protein kinase B (Akt), whereas EGC did so through pathways including the disruption of the HRG-stimulated activation of ErbB2/ErbB3 but not Akt. EGC, as well as EGCG, could play an important role against the promotion of metastasis of breast cancer cells.",M2
19401448,"<e>Heregulin</e> regulates prolactinoma gene expression.To investigate the role of p185(her2/neu)/ErbB3 signaling in pituitary tumor function, we examined these receptors in human prolactinomas. Immunofluorescent p185(her2/neu) was detected in almost all (seven of eight), and ErbB3 expression in a subset (four of eight) of tumors (seven adenomas and one carcinoma). Quantitative PCR also showed abundant ErbB3 mRNA in tumor specimens derived from a rarely encountered prolactin-cell carcinoma. Activation of p185(c-neu)/ErbB3 signaling with heregulin, the ErbB3 ligand, in rat lacto-somatotroph (GH4C1) tumor cells specifically induced prolactin (PRL) mRNA expression approximately 5-fold and PRL secretion approximately 4-fold, whereas growth hormone expression was unchanged. Heregulin (6 nmol/L) induced tyrosine phosphorylation and ErbB3 and p185(c-neu) heterodimerization, with subsequent activation of intracellular ERK and Akt. The Akt signal was specific to ErbB3 activation by heregulin, and was not observed in response to epidermal growth factor activation of epidermal growth factor receptor. Gefitinib, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suppressed heregulin-mediated p185(c-neu)/ErbB3 signaling to PRL. Heregulin induction of PRL was also abrogated by transfecting cells with short interfering RNA directed against ErbB3. Pharmacologic inhibition of heregulin-induced phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt (with LY294002) and ERK (with U0126) signaling, as well as short interfering RNA-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 down-regulation, showed ERK signaling as the primary transducer of heregulin signaling to PRL. These results show ErbB3 expression in human prolactinomas and a novel ErbB3-mediated mechanism for PRL regulation in experimental lactotroph tumors. Targeted inhibition of up-regulated p185(c-neu)/ErbB3 activity could be useful for the treatment of aggressive prolactinomas resistant to conventional therapy.",M2
19360341,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A is regulated by HER-2 signalling and correlates with breast cancer progression.Activation of HER-2/neu leads to multiple signalling cascades and plays a vital role in cell survival and growth. We used a signal transduction antibody array to characterize the tyrosine phosphorylation profiles in <e>heregulin</e> (HRG alpha1)-treated BT474 breast cancer cells, and identified a group of 80 molecules in which tyrosine phosphorylation was highly regulated by HRG-enhanced HER-2/neu signalling. These phosphoproteins included many known HER-2/neu-regulated molecules (e.g., SHC, Akt, Syk and Stat1) and proteins that had not been previously linked to HER-2/neu signalling, such as Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), apoptosis repressor with CARD domain (ARC), and the tumour suppressor, protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A). Pharmacological inhibition with HER-2 inhibitor AG825, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98095, and p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 confirmed that PP2A phosphorylation was modulated by the complicated, HER-2/neu-driven downstream signal network, with the PI3K and MEK1/2 positively, while the p38MAPK negatively regulating its tyrosine phosphorylation. In breast tumour specimens, expression of tyrosine-phosphorylated PP2A (pY307-PP2A) was highly increased in the HER-2/neu positive breast tumours, and significantly correlated to tumour progression, thus enhancing its potential prognostic value. Our data provide meaningful information in the elucidation of the HER-2-driven tyrosine phosphorylation network, and in the development of phosphopeptide-related targets as prognostication indicators.",M2
19293185,"The EGF/CSF-1 paracrine invasion loop can be triggered by <e>heregulin</e> beta1 and CXCL12.An important step in the process of metastasis from the primary tumor is invasive spread into the surrounding stroma. Using an in vivo invasion assay, we have previously shown that imposed gradients of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) can induce invasion through an EGF/CSF-1 paracrine loop between cancer cells and macrophages. We now report that invasion induced by other ligands also relies on this EGF/CSF-1 paracrine invasive loop. Using an in vivo invasion assay, we show that MTLn3 breast cancer cells overexpressing ErbB3 exhibit enhanced invasion compared with control MTLn3 cells in response to the ErbB3 ligand HRG-beta1. The invasive response of both MTLn3-ErbB3 and transgenic MMTV-Neu tumors to HRG-beta1 is inhibited by blocking EGF receptor, CSF-1 receptor, or macrophage function, indicating that invasiveness to HRG-beta1 is dependent on the EGF/CSF-1 paracrine loop. Furthermore, we show that CXCL12 also triggers in vivo invasion of transgenic MMTV-PyMT tumors in an EGF/CSF-1-dependent manner. Although the invasion induced by HRG-beta1 or CXCL12 is dependent on the EGF/CSF-1 paracrine loop, invasion induced by EGF is not dependent on HRG-beta1 or CXCL12 signaling, showing an asymmetrical relationship between different ligand/receptor systems in driving invasion. Our results identify a stromal/tumor interaction that acts as an engine underlying invasion induced by multiple ligands.",M2
19269083,"<e>Heregulin</e>-beta1 promotes metastasis of breast cancer cell line SKBR3 through upregulation of Snail and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.HRG-beta1 stimulation of breast cancer cell line SKBR3 resulted in not only increased cell migration and invasion, upregulation of some mesenchymal markers, and downregulation of epithelial marker, but also upregulation of transcription factor Snail and its nuclear translocation. Similar results were acquired for cells transfected with Snail cDNA. Furthermore, downregulation of Snail by siRNA attenuated HRG-beta1 induced EMT-like phenotype. Inhibition of Akt kinase activation by a PI3K inhibitor LY294002, or exogenous expression of a kinase-dead mutant of Akt abrogated the increase of Snail expression induced by HRG-beta1. Conversely, expression of a constitutively active Akt resulted in increase of Snail expression. These results indicated that Snail upregulation by HRG-beta1 is mediated via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and that Snail plays a key role in HRG-beta1 induced breast cancer cell metastasis through induction of EMT.",M2
19223396,"Memo is a cofilin-interacting protein that influences PLCgamma1 and cofilin activities, and is essential for maintaining directionality during ErbB2-induced tumor-cell migration.<e>Heregulin</e> (HRG) activates ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers thereby stimulating many cellular responses, including motility. Memo and PLCgamma1 interact with ErbB2 autophosphorylation sites and are essential for HRG-induced chemotaxis. By tracing HRG-stimulated cell migration in Dunn chambers, we found that Memo- or PLCgamma1 knockdown (KD) strongly impairs cell directionality. Memo has no obvious enzymatic activity and was discovered via its ability to complex with ErbB2. Using the yeast two-hybrid approach to gain insight into Memo function, an interaction between Memo and cofilin, a regulator of actin dynamics, was uncovered. The interaction was confirmed in vitro using recombinant proteins and in vivo in co-immunoprecipitation experiments where Memo was detected in complexes with cofilin, ErbB2 and PLCgamma1. Interestingly, in Memo KD cells, HRG-induced PLCgamma1 phosphorylation was decreased, suggesting that Memo regulates PLCgamma1 activation. Furthermore, HRG-induced recruitment of GFP-cofilin to lamellipodia is impaired in Memo and in PLCgamma1 KD cells, suggesting that both proteins lie upstream of cofilin in models of ErbB2-driven tumor-cell migration. Finally, in vitro F-actin binding and depolymerization assays showed that Memo enhances cofilin depolymerizing and severing activity. In summary, these data indicate that Memo also regulates actin dynamics by interacting with cofilin and enhancing its function.",M2
19205871,"Growth factor-induced resistance to tamoxifen is associated with a mutation of estrogen receptor alpha and its phosphorylation at serine 305.Estrogens play a crucial role in breast tumor growth, which is the rationale for the use of antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen, in women with estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha-positive breast cancer. However, hormone resistance is a major clinical problem. Altered growth factor signaling to the ERalpha pathway has been shown to be associated with the development of clinical resistance. We previously have identified a mutation that replaces arginine for lysine at residue 303 (K303R) of ERalpha, which confers hypersensitive growth in low levels of estrogen. To determine if the K303R mutation could participate in the evolution of hormone resistance, we generated MCF-7 breast cancer cells stably transfected with either wild-type (WT) or K303R ERalpha. We found that the mutation confers decreased sensitivity to tamoxifen in the presence of the growth factor <e>heregulin</e>, using anchorage-independent growth assays. K303R ERalpha-expressing cells were hypersensitive to growth factor signals. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of serine 305 within the hinge domain of ERalpha might play a key role in increasing ligand-independent activity of the mutant receptor. We hypothesize that the mutation adapts the receptor for enhanced bidirectional cross-talk with the HER2 growth factor receptor pathway, which then impacts on responsiveness to tamoxifen.",M2
19148499,"Expression of <e>heregulin</e>, phosphorylated HER-2, HER-3 and HER-4 in HER-2 negative breast cancers.A significant number of HER-2 amplified breast cancers is effectively treated by trastuzumab and further shows receptor-enhanced chemosensitivity. Recent studies have postulated transactivation of HER-2 also in tumors expressing phosphorylated/activated HER-2 (pHER-2) and of the HER-3/HER-4 ligand heregulin (HRG), independent of HER-2 amplification. As a consequence, a subset of tumors without HER-2 overexpression would be sensitive to trastuzumab chemotherapy. To investigate the potential transactivation of HER-2, in 171 breast cancers from the GENICA study with negative/low expression of HER-2 we analyzed the expression of pHER-2, HRG, HER-3 and HER-4 by immunohistochemistry. None of the tumors examined displayed expression of pHER-2. Moderate or strong cytoplasmic staining of HRG, HER-3 and HER-4 was observed in 44 (26%), 67 (39%) and 33 (19%) cases, respectively. No association of HRG, HER-3 and HER-4 with the survival of patients or with known prognostic clinical factors was seen. In conclusion, our data obtained on a well-characterized cohort of breast cancers provide no evidence of HER-2-activation in the absence of HER-2 overexpression. The biological function and clinical implications of HRG, HER-3 and HER-4 in this group of tumors remain unclear. Our results cannot support the hypothesis of a transactivation of HER-2 and thus a possible therapeutic benefit of trastuzumab in HER-2 negative breast cancers.",M2
19103753,"Activation of Stat3 by <e>heregulin</e>/ErbB-2 through the co-option of progesterone receptor signaling drives breast cancer growth.Cross talk between the steroid hormone receptors for estrogen and progesterone (PR) and the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases appears to be a hallmark of breast cancer growth, but its underlying mechanism remains poorly explored. Here we have highlighted signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) as a key protein activated by heregulin (HRG), a ligand of the ErbB receptors, through co-opted, ligand-independent PR function as a signaling molecule. Stat3 activation was an absolute requirement in HRG-induced mammary tumor growth, and targeting Stat3 effectively inhibited growth of breast cancer cells with activated HRG/ErbB-2 and PR. Our findings unravel a novel potential therapeutic intervention in PR- and ErbB-2-positive breast tumors, involving the specific blockage of PR signaling activity.",M2
18852121,"EBP1, an ErbB3-binding protein, is decreased in prostate cancer and implicated in hormone resistance.Aberrant activation of the androgen receptor (AR) by the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer contributes to the development of hormone resistance in prostate cancer. EBP1, an ErbB3-binding protein, acts as an AR corepressor. As EBP1 is decreased in preclinical models of hormone-refractory prostate cancer, we studied the expression of EBP1 in human prostate cancer. We found that the expression of the EBP1 gene was significantly decreased in prostate cancer tissues compared with benign prostate at both mRNA and protein levels. Restoration of EBP1 expression in the hormone-refractory LNCaP C81 cell line led to an amelioration of the androgen-independent phenotype based on established biological criteria and a reduction in the expression of a cohort of AR target genes. The ability of the ErbB3 ligand <e>heregulin</e> (HRG) to stimulate growth and AKT phosphorylation of hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells was abolished. Abrogation of EBP1 expression by short hairpin RNA in hormone-dependent LNCaP cells, which undergo apoptosis in response to HRG, resulted in HRG-stimulated cell growth. Restoration of EBP1 expression decreased the tumorigenicity of C81 xenografts in female mice, whereas elimination of EBP1 expression enhanced the ability of LNCaP cells to grow in female mice. Our data support a role for EBP1 in the development of hormone-refractory prostate cancer via inhibition of both AR- and HRG-stimulated growth and present a novel strategy for treating androgen-refractory prostate cancer.",M2
18820370,"Phosphoproteome and transcriptome analyses of ErbB ligand-stimulated MCF-7 cells.Cellular signal transduction pathways and gene expression are tightly regulated to accommodate changes in response to physiological environments. In the current study, molecules were identified that are activated as a result of intracellular signaling and immediately expressed as mRNA in MCF-7 breast cancer cells shortly after stimulation of ErbB receptor ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) or <e>heregulin</e> (HRG). For the identification of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and expressed genes, a SILAC (stable isotopic labeling using amino acids in cell culture) method and Affymetrix gene expression array system, respectively, were used. Unexpectedly, the overlapping of genes appeared in two experimental datasets was very low for HRG (43 hits in the proteome data, 1,655 in the transcriptome data, and 5 hits common to both datasets), while no overlapping gene was detected for EGF (15 hits in the proteome data, 211 hits in the transcriptome data, and no hits common to both datasets). The HRG overlapping genes included ERBB2, NEDD9, MAPK3, JUP and EPHA2. Biological pathway analysis indicated that HRG-stimulated molecular activation is significantly related to cancer pathways including bladder cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia and pancreatic cancer (p &lt; 0.05). The proteome datasets of EGF and HRG contain molecules that are related to Axon guidance, ErbB signaling and VEGF signaling at a high rate.",M2
18716323,"Scrib regulates PAK activity during the cell migration process.Genetic studies have highlighted the key role of Scrib in the development of Metazoans. Deficiency in Scrib impairs many aspects of cell polarity and cell movement although the mechanisms involved remain unclear. In mammals, Scrib belongs to a protein complex containing betaPIX, an exchange factor for Rac/Cdc42, and GIT1, a GTPase activating protein for ARF6 implicated in receptor recycling and exocytosis. Here we show that the Scrib complex associates with PAK, a serine-threonine kinase family crucial for cell migration. PAK colocalizes with members of the Scrib complex at the leading edge of <e>heregulin</e>-treated T47D breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that the Scrib complex is required for epithelial cells and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts to efficiently respond to chemoattractant cues. In Scrib-deficient cells, the pool of cortical PAK is decreased, thereby precluding its proper activation by Rac. Loss of Scrib also impairs the polarized distribution of active Rac at the leading edge and compromises the regulated activation of the GTPase in T47D cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These data underscore the role of Scrib in cell migration and show the strong impact of Scrib in the function of PAK and Rac, two key molecules implicated in this process.",M2
18682844,"HER2 oncogenic function escapes EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors via activation of alternative HER receptors in breast cancer cells.BACKGROUND: The response rate to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may be poor and unpredictable in cancer patients with EGFR expression itself being an inadequate response indicator. There is limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying this resistance. Furthermore, although TKIs suppress the growth of HER2-overexpressing breast tumor cells, they do not fully inhibit HER2 oncogenic function at physiological doses. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we have provided a molecular mechanism of how HER2 oncogenic function escapes TKIs' inhibition via alternative HER receptor activation as a result of autocrine ligand release. Using both Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) which monitors in situ HER receptor phosphorylation as well as classical biochemical analysis, we have shown that the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of EGFR, AG1478 and Iressa (Gefitinib) decreased EGFR and HER3 phosphorylation through the inhibition of EGFR/HER3 dimerization. Consequent to this, we demonstrate that cleavage of HER4 and dimerization of HER4/HER2 occur together with reactivation of HER3 via HER2/HER3, leading to persistent HER2 phosphorylation in the now resistant, surviving cells. These drug treatment-induced processes were found to be mediated by the release of ligands including <e>heregulin</e> and betacellulin that activate HER3 and HER4 via HER2. Whereas an anti-betacellulin antibody in combination with Iressa increased the anti-proliferative effect in resistant cells, ligands such as heregulin and betacellulin rendered sensitive SKBR3 cells resistant to Iressa. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate the role of drug-induced autocrine events leading to the activation of alternative HER receptors in maintaining HER2 phosphorylation and in mediating resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in breast cancer cells, and hence specify treatment opportunities to overcome resistance in patients.",M2
18644866,"Filamin A links sphingosine kinase 1 and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 at lamellipodia to orchestrate cell migration.Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to produce the potent lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which plays a critical role in cell motility via its cell surface receptors. Here, we have identified filamin A (FLNa), an actin-cross-linking protein involved in cell movement, as a bona fide SphK1-interacting protein. <e>Heregulin</e> stimulated SphK1 activity only in FLNa-expressing A7 melanoma cells but not in FLNa-deficient cells and induced its translocation and colocalization with FLNa at lamellipodia. SphK1 was required for heregulin-induced migration, lamellipodia formation, activation of PAK1, and subsequent FLNa phosphorylation. S1P directly stimulated PAK1 kinase, suggesting that it may be a target of intracellularly generated S1P. Heregulin also induced colocalization of S1P(1) (promotility S1P receptor) but not S1P(2), with SphK1 and FLNa at membrane ruffles. Moreover, an S1P(1) antagonist inhibited the lamellipodia formation induced by heregulin. Hence, FLNa links SphK1 and S1P(1) to locally influence the dynamics of actin cytoskeletal structures by orchestrating the concerted actions of the triumvirate of SphK1, FLNa, and PAK1, each of which requires and/or regulates the actions of the others, at lamellipodia to promote cell movement.",M2
18600430,"<e>Heregulin</e>-beta promotes matrix metalloproteinase-7 expression via HER2-mediated AP-1 activation in MCF-7 cells.It has been reported that HER2 level is strongly correlated with the expression of MMP-7 in some carcinomas. HER2 is a preferred heterodimerization partner of EGFR, HER3, and HER4. HER2 overexpression is believed to enhance the signaling from these receptors in response to binding of their specific ligands. In this study, we show that heregulin-beta (HRG-beta) stimulation remarkably induced MMP-7 promoter activity and significantly enhanced the expression and activity of MMP-7 in MCF-7 cells overexpressing HER2. The expression of c-Jun and c-Fos and the level of the phosphorylated c-Jun were markedly increased after HRG-beta treatment in MCF-7/HER2 cells. Increased MMP-7 promoter activity was observed in MCF-7/c-Jun cells. The activity of the MMP-7 promoter induced by HRG-beta in MCF-7/HER2 cells could be inhibited by a dominant negative c-Jun mutant TAM67 and by the mutagenesis of the AP-1 site. c-Jun binding to MMP-7 promoter was confirmed by ChIP assays. The data indicate a close link among HRG-beta stimulation, HER signaling, and AP-1 activation. Our data suggest that HRG-beta-induced MMP-7 expression was regulated by HER2-mediated AP-1 activation in MCF-7 cells.",M2
18411304,"Pak1 and Pak2 mediate tumor cell invasion through distinct signaling mechanisms.Pak kinases are thought to play critical roles in cell migration and invasion. Here, we analyze the roles of Pak1 and Pak2 in breast carcinoma cell invasion using the transient transfection of small interfering RNA. We find that although both Pak1 and Pak2 contribute to breast carcinoma invasion stimulated by <e>heregulin</e>, these roles are mediated by distinct signaling mechanisms. Thus, whereas the depletion of Pak1 interferes with the heregulin-mediated dephosphorylation of cofilin, the depletion of Pak2 does not. The depletion of Pak1 also has a stronger inhibitory effect on lamellipodial protrusion than does the depletion of Pak2. Interestingly, Pak1 and Pak2 play opposite roles in regulating the phosphorylation of the myosin light chain (MLC). Whereas the depletion of Pak1 decreases phospho-MLC levels in heregulin-stimulated cells, the depletion of Pak2 enhances MLC phosphorylation. Consistent with their opposite effects on MLC phosphorylation, Pak1 and Pak2 differentially modulate focal adhesions. Pak2-depleted cells display an increase in focal adhesion size, whereas in Pak1-depleted cells, focal adhesions fail to mature. We also found that the depletion of Pak2, but not Pak1, enhances RhoA activity and that the inhibition of RhoA signaling in Pak2-depleted cells decreases MLC phosphorylation and restores cell invasion. In summary, this work presents the first comprehensive analysis of functional differences between the Pak1 and Pak2 isoforms.",M2
18398842,"<e>Heregulin</e>-induced activation of ErbB3 by EGFR tyrosine kinase activity promotes tumor growth and metastasis in melanoma cells.ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase has been shown to induce tumor progression in several types of cancer through heterodimerization with ErbB2. However, the role of ErbB3 and its ligand heregulin (HRG) in tumor metastasis remains poorly understood. In the present study, we tried to clarify their contributions to the metastasis of ErbB3-overexpressing B16-BL6 melanoma cells. Stimulation with HRG induced phosphorylation of ErbB3 and metastatic properties including MMP-9 expression, invasion, adhesion and experimental lung metastasis in vivo. These cellular responses were blocked by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR with PD153035. In addition, phosphorylation of EGFR was rapidly induced by HRG, suggesting that EGFR is a possible heterodimeric counterpart of ErbB3. RNA interference demonstrated that subcutaneous tumor growth and angiogenesis was attenuated by inactivation of ErbB3 in cancer cells. Although experimental pulmonary metastasis was not affected by the knockdown of ErbB3, spontaneous metastasis was, even when primary tumors in the foot pad were amputated at a similar size. These results indicate that HRG-induced activation of ErbB3 via EGFR promotes tumor growth and metastasis of melanoma cells.",M2

In this study, six groups were used, group one was used as control (PS: BME-RA; IS: PDGF, bFGF, FSK and HRG). In group 2, the preinducer was similar to group 1, and in the induction stage, progesterone replaced HRG. In groups 3 and 4, the preinducer was progesterone; and at the induction stage, the inducer was similar to groups 1 and 2. Accordingly, in groups 5 and 6, the preinducer was FSK. The immunohistochemical differentiation markers were S-100 and P0, and RT-PCR markers were OCT-4 and P0 at the preinduction stage, while at the induction stage P0 and NeuroD were used. The results of the study showed that S-100 was expressed in the groups after the induction stage, however, P0 was not expressed in any group. There was not any significant difference between the percentage of S100 positive cells in the 1st and 2nd groups. P0 was expressed at the mRNA level in the undifferentiated BMSCs and in the 3rd and 4th groups after the preinduction and the induction stages.

18355957,"Inhibition of <e>heregulin</e> mediated MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth by the ErbB3 binding protein EBP1.The ErbB2/3 heterodimer plays a critical role in breast cancer genesis and progression. EBP1, an ErbB3 binding protein, inhibits breast cancer growth but its effects on ErbB3 ligand mediated signal transduction or ErbB receptors is not known. We report here that ectopic expression of EBP1 in MCF-7 and AU565 breast cancer cell lines inhibited HRG-induced proliferation. ErbB2 protein levels were substantially decreased in EBP1 transfectants, while ErbB3 levels were unchanged. HRG-induced AKT activation was attenuated in EBP1 stable transfectants and transfection of a constitutively activated AKT partially restored the growth response to HRG. Down-regulation of EBP1 expression in MCF-7 cells by shRNA resulted in increased cell growth in response to HRG and increased cyclin D1 and ErbB2 expression. These results suggest that EBP1, by down-regulating ErbB signal transduction, attentuates HRG-mediated growth of breast cancer cells.",M2
18350142,"Integrative genome-wide expression analysis bears evidence of estrogen receptor-independent transcription in <e>heregulin</e>-stimulated MCF-7 cells.Heregulin beta-1 (HRG) is an extracellular ligand that activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways through ErbB receptors. MAPK and Akt have been shown to phosphorylate the estrogen receptor (ER) at Ser-118 and Ser-167, respectively, thereby mimicking the effects of estrogenic activity such as estrogen responsive element (ERE)-dependent transcription. In the current study, integrative analysis was performed using two tiling array platforms, comprising histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation and RNA mapping, together with array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis in an effort to identify HRG-regulated genes in ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Through application of various threshold settings, 333 (326 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated) HRG-regulated genes were detected. Prediction of upstream transcription factors (TFs) and pathway analysis indicated that 21% of HRG-induced gene regulation may be controlled by the MAPK cascade, while only 0.6% of the gene expression is controlled by ERE. A comparison with previously reported estrogen (E2)-regulated gene expression data revealed that only 12 common genes were identified between the 333 HRG-regulated (3.6%) and 239 E2-regulated (5.0%) gene groups. However, with respect to enriched upstream TFs, 4 common TFs were identified in the 14 HRG-regulated (28.6%) and 13 E2-regulated (30.8%) gene groups. These results indicated that while E2 and HRG may induce common TFs, the regulatory mechanisms that govern HRG- and E2-induced gene expression differ.",M2

In this work, we have applied the single-molecule fluorescence microscopic method to study lateral mobility change of HER2 on activation by imaging and tracking individual GFP-tagged HER2 molecules on the membrane of living cells. The single HER2 molecules displayed different diffusion rates and modes. It was interesting to find that the mobility of HER2 increased upon stimulation by <e>heregulin</e> beta1, the specific ligand of HER3. The faster diffusion was related to the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 or EGFR.

18276068,"EGFR and ErbB2 are functionally coupled to CD44 and regulate shedding, internalization and motogenic effect of CD44.Activation of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases is involved in a range of human cancers. Transmembrane signaling mediated by ErbB proteins is stimulated by peptide growth factors and is blocked by monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab. ErbB receptors exert their function in conjunction with non-ErbB proteins, e.g. CD44. Here we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and <e>heregulin</e> induce CD44 shedding in JIMT-1, an ErbB2-overexpressing cell line resistant to trastuzumab, accompanied by internalization and intramembrane proteolysis of CD44 and enhanced cellular motility. These effects of EGF and heregulin are blocked by pertuzumab. Trastuzumab inhibits the heregulin- and hyaluronan oligosaccharide-induced shedding and internalization of CD44 and their motogenic effect. Trastuzumab also blocks CD44 shedding from JIMT-1 xenograft tumors in vivo. At the same time the internalization rate of trastuzumab is increased by hyaluronan oligosaccharide treatment in vitro. Our experiments point to an unexpected, but potentially important mechanism of action of ErbB receptor-targeted monoclonal antibodies used in the treatment of cancer.",M2
18272043,"Expression of <e>heregulin</e> and ErbB receptors in mesenchymal stem cells.BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells are a promising cell type for cell transplantation in myocardial infarction. Type I neuregulins-1, also known as heregulin, can promote the survival of cardiomyocytes and stimulate angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of heregulin and ErbB receptors in mesenchymal stem cells, then further detect the secretion of heregulin and the changes in expression of heregulin and ErbB receptors under conditions of serum deprivation and hypoxia. METHODS: Mesenchymal stem cells isolated from bone marrow of 180 g male Sprague-Dawley rats were cultured. Passage 3 cells were detected experimentally by regular reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative real time PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: Heregulin and ErbB receptors were expressed in mesenchymal stem cells, and all three ErbB receptors mRNA expressions were significantly down-regulated by serum deprivation and hypoxia, but serum deprivation and hypoxia significantly increased the protein expression of heregulin. Serum deprivation and hypoxia more than 12 hours could induce the secretion of heregulin. CONCLUSIONS: Mesenchymal stem cells can express all three ErbB receptors and heregulin. Serum deprivation and hypoxia decrease the mRNA expression of ErbB receptors, increase the expression of heregulin, and activate the secretion of heregulin.",M2
18174256,"Downregulation of HER2 by RIG1 involves the PI3K/Akt pathway in ovarian cancer cells.Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is known to downregulate HER2 oncoprotein (p185(HER2) or briefly p185) in prostate cancer cells. We demonstrate that the IFN-gamma-induced retinoid-inducible gene 1 (RIG1) acts as a transrepressor of p185. Furthermore, we exhibit that RIG1 downregulates the activated (phosphorylated) form of p185 and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (Akt) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), downstream substrates of HER2. We also elucidate that <e>heregulin</e> (HRG) specifically restores the activation of p185 and Akt after their activities are reduced by RIG1. Additionally, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increases through the HER2- and Akt/mTOR-signaling pathways, indicating that VEGF is downregulated by RIG1 within the cell. These findings suggest that RIG1 plays a role in IFN-gamma-mediated therapy by downregulating p185 and its downstream PI3K/Akt/mTOR/VEGF-signaling pathway. These results may provide a new therapeutic mechanism for the clinical use of IFN-gamma and RIG1.",M2
18155194,"Presence of EGF growth factor ligands and their effects on cultured rat conjunctival goblet cell proliferation.The amount of mucin on the ocular surface is regulated by the rate of mucin synthesis, mucin secretion, and the number of goblet cells. We have previously shown that cholinergic agonists are potent stimuli of mucin secretion. In contrast, there have been no studies on the control of goblet cell proliferation. In this study we investigate the presence of the EGF family of growth factors and their receptors in rat conjunctiva and cultured rat conjunctival goblet cells as well as their effects on activation of signaling intermediates and goblet cell proliferation. Rat conjunctival goblet cells were grown in organ culture and identified as goblet cells by their morphology and positive staining for the lectin UEA-1 and cytokeratin 7. In the rat conjunctiva, the presence of the EGF family members epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), heparin binding EGF (HB-EGF), and <e>heregulin</e> was determined by RT-PCR. The receptors for these ligands, EGF receptor (EGFR), erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4 were detected in both rat conjunctiva and goblet cells by Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence microscopy of conjunctival tissue determined that EGFR was present as punctate staining in the cytoplasm of conjunctival goblet cells while ErbB2 was present in the basolateral and lateral membranes of goblet cells. ErbB3 was localized to the cytosol of rat conjunctival goblet cells. In cultured goblet cells, EGFR and ErbB2 were present in the perinuclear area of the cells. ErbB3 was widely distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cells. ErbB4 was not detected in either the conjunctiva or goblet cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Using a multiplex assay system we measured phosphorylation (activation) of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), also known as ERK, Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK and AKT (also known as protein kinase B), molecules known to be activated by EGF receptor members. EGF, TGF-alpha and HB-EGF activated the signaling intermediate proteins whereas heregulin did not. No EGF family member significantly activated AKT. Consistent with these findings, EGF, TGF-alpha and HB-EGF each stimulated goblet cell proliferation as measured by WST-1 assay or immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody against Ki-67, a protein expressed in dividing cells. Heregulin did not cause goblet cell proliferation. We conclude that multiple members of the EGF family, EGF, TGF-alpha and HB-EGF, and heregulin are present with three of the four erbB receptor subtypes. EGF, TGF-alpha and HB-EGF all stimulated the activation of signaling intermediates and caused goblet cell proliferation.",M2
18056992,"A critical role for HSP90 in cancer cell invasion involves interaction with the extracellular domain of HER-2.HSP90 is a ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperone that controls the folding, assembly, intracellular disposition, and proteolytic turnover of many proteins, most of which are involved in signal transduction processes. Recently, a surface form of HSP90 has been identified and associated with cell migration events. In this paper, we explore the interaction of surface HSP90 with HER-2, a receptor-like glycoprotein and member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases that play central roles in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and migration as well as in cancer progress. The involvement of HSP90 in the regulation of HER-2 has been attributed so far to receptor stabilization via interaction with its cytoplasmic kinase domain. Here we present evidence, using glutathione S-transferase pull-down and transfection assays, for a novel interaction between surface HSP90 and the extracellular domain of HER-2. Specific disruption of this interaction using mAb 4C5, a function-blocking monoclonal antibody against HSP90, inhibits cell invasion accompanied by altered actin dynamics in human breast cancer cells under ligand stimulation conditions with <e>heregulin</e>. Additionally, disruption of surface HSP90/HER-2 interaction leads to inhibition of heregulin-induced HER-2-HER-3 heterodimer formation, reduced HER-2 phosphorylation, and impaired downstream kinase signaling. Interestingly, this disruption does not affect HER-2 internalization. Our data suggest that surface HSP90 is involved in heregulin-induced HER-2 activation and signaling, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement, essential for cell invasion.",M2
18056467,"Cks1 regulates cdk1 expression: a novel role during mitotic entry in breast cancer cells.Cks1, a small protein whose expression is strongly associated with aggressive breast tumors, is a component of cyclin-cdk complexes, as well as the SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase. In these studies, we explored its roles in estrogen receptor-positive breast tumor cells. When exposed to the antiestrogen ICI 182780, these cells accumulate in G(1) by reducing the expression of Cks1, and increasing the levels of p130/Rb2, a cdk2 inhibitor and SCF(Skp2) target. <e>Heregulin</e> beta1 or estradiol abrogate antiestrogen effects by increasing Cks1 expression, down-regulating p130/Rb2 and inducing S phase entry. Depletion of Cks1 in these cells by RNA interference concomitantly decreased Skp2 and up-regulated p130/Rb2 and another SCF(Skp2) target, p27(Kip1). Remarkably, however, Cks1-depleted cells not only exhibit slowed G(1) progression, but also accumulate in G(2)-M due to blocked mitotic entry. Notably, we show that cdk1 expression, which is crucial for M phase entry, is drastically diminished by Cks1 depletion, and that restoration of cdk1 reduces G(2)-M accumulation in Cks1-depleted cells. cdk1 reduction in Cks1-depleted cells is a consequence of a marked decrease in its mRNA and not due to alteration in its proteolytic turnover. Both heregulin beta1 and estradiol could neither restore cdk1 nor sustain cycling in Cks1-depleted cells, although classical estrogen receptor function remained unaltered. Cks1 depletion also decreased Skp2 in human mammary epithelial cells without altering cell cycle progression. Thus, the indispensability of Cks1 to the breast cancer cell cycle, versus its redundancy in normal cells, suggests that Cks1 abrogation could be an effective interventional strategy in breast cancer.",M2
18004277,"Ligand-dependent responses of the ErbB signaling network: experimental and modeling analyses.Deregulation of ErbB signaling plays a key role in the progression of multiple human cancers. To help understand ErbB signaling quantitatively, in this work we combine traditional experiments with computational modeling, building a model that describes how stimulation of all four ErbB receptors with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and <e>heregulin</e> (HRG) leads to activation of two critical downstream proteins, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt. Model analysis and experimental validation show that (i) ErbB2 overexpression, which occurs in approximately 25% of all breast cancers, transforms transient EGF-induced signaling into sustained signaling, (ii) HRG-induced ERK activity is much more robust to the ERK cascade inhibitor U0126 than EGF-induced ERK activity, and (iii) phosphoinositol-3 kinase is a major regulator of post-peak but not pre-peak EGF-induced ERK activity. Sensitivity analysis leads to the hypothesis that ERK activation is robust to parameter perturbation at high ligand doses, while Akt activation is not.",M2
17999741,"Up-regulation of alphavbeta3 integrin expression is a novel molecular response to chemotherapy-induced cell damage in a <e>heregulin</e>-dependent manner.alpha(v)beta(3) integrin has a dual role in apoptosis. Whereas ligated alpha(v)beta(3) activates cell survival pathways and suppresses pro-apoptotic signals, unligated alpha(v)beta(3) or integrins bound to soluble ligands promote apoptosis. In this study, we assessed the role of alpha(v)beta(3) in chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells expressing different levels of heregulin (HRG). Expression levels of the RGD-binding integrins alpha(v)beta(3) were measured in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and its low HRG-expressing derivative (MDA-MB-231/AS31) treated with the microtubule-interfering agents (MIAs) paclitaxel and vincristine. Following treatment, only alpha(v)beta(3) levels were significantly increased in MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, alpha(v)beta(3) expression was more significantly up-regulated in the MDA-MB-231/AS31 cells than in the parental cells. This MIA-induced increase of alpha(v)beta(3) expression was correlated with a decrease in cell viability and an increase in apoptosis in MDA-MB-231/AS31 cells, indicating that overexpression of alpha(v)beta(3) is linked to chemotherapy-induced cell death in low HRG-expressing breast cancer models. Moreover, a paclitaxel-induced increase of alpha(v)beta(3) was also observed in MCF-7 cells but not in an doxorubicin-resistant derivative that shows cross-resistance to paclitaxel, further providing evidence that the extent of alpha(v)beta(3) up-regulation is related to cell damage. These results indicate that alpha(v)beta(3) integrin is dramatically up-regulated in low HRG-expressing breast cancer models that are highly responsive to MIAs, thus providing a novel molecular marker of chemosensitivity influenced by HRG levels in breast cancer cells.",M2
17941050,"Inhibition of N-cadherin and beta-catenin function reduces axon-induced Schwann cell proliferation.N-cadherin and beta-catenin are involved in cell adhesion and cell cycle in tumor cells and neural crest. Both are expressed at key stages of Schwann cell (SC) development, but little is known about their function in the SC lineage. We studied the role of these molecules in adult rat derived SC-embryonic dorsal root ganglion cocultures by using low-Ca(2+) conditions and specific blocking antibodies to interfere with N-cadherin function and by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to decrease beta-catenin expression in both SC-neuron cocultures and adult rat-derived SC monocultures. N-cadherin blocking conditions decreased SC-axon association and reduced axon-induced SC proliferation. In SC monocultures, beta-catenin reduction diminished the proliferative response of SCs to the mitogen beta1-<e>heregulin</e>, and, in SC-DRG cocultures, beta-catenin reduction inhibited axon-contact-dependent SC proliferation. Stimulation of SC cultures with beta1-heregulin increased total beta-catenin protein amount, phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and beta-catenin presence in nuclear extracts. In conclusion, our findings suggest a previously unrecognized contribution of beta-catenin and N-cadherin to axon-induced SC proliferation.",M2
17922035,"Heat shock factor 1 represses estrogen-dependent transcription through association with MTA1.Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the transcriptional activator of the heat shock genes, is increasingly implicated in cancer. We have shown that HSF1 binds to the corepressor metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) in vitro and in human breast carcinoma samples. HSF1-MTA1 complex formation was strongly induced by the transforming ligand <e>heregulin</e> and complexes incorporated a number of additional proteins including histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and 2) and Mi2alpha, all components of the NuRD corepressor complex. These complexes were induced to assemble on the chromatin of MCF7 breast carcinoma cells and associated with the promoters of estrogen-responsive genes. Such HSF1 complexes participate in repression of estrogen-dependent transcription in breast carcinoma cells treated with heregulin and this effect was inhibited by MTA1 knockdown. Repression of estrogen-dependent transcription may contribute to the role of HSF1 in cancer.",M2
17823122,"Activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Bmx/Etk mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, and ErbB3 in prostate cancer cells.Pathways activated downstream of constitutively active phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer (PCa) cells are possible therapeutic targets. We found that the nonreceptor Tec family tyrosine kinase Bmx/Etk was activated by tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of Src and PI 3-kinase in PTEN-deficient LNCaP and PC3 PCa cells and that Bmx down-regulation by short interfering RNA markedly inhibited LNCaP cell growth. Bmx also associated with ErbB3 in LNCaP cells, and <e>heregulin</e>-beta1 enhanced this interaction and further stimulated Bmx activity. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) similarly stimulated an interaction between Bmx and EGF receptor and rapidly increased Bmx kinase activity. Bmx stimulation in response to heregulin-beta1 and EGF was Src-dependent, and heregulin-beta1 stimulation of Bmx was also PI 3-kinase-dependent. In contrast, the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Bmx in response to EGF was PI 3-kinase-independent. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Bmx is a critical downstream target of the constitutively active PI 3-kinase in PTEN-deficient PCa cells and further show that Bmx is recruited by the EGF receptor and ErbB3 and activated in response to their respective ligands. Therefore, Bmx may be a valuable therapeutic target in PCa and other epithelial malignancies in which PI 3-kinase or EGF receptor family pathways are activated.",M2
17761534,"ErbB4 isoforms selectively regulate growth factor induced Madin-Darby canine kidney cell tubulogenesis.ErbB4, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family that can be activated by <e>heregulin</e> beta1 and heparin binding (HB)-EGF, is expressed as alternatively spliced isoforms characterized by variant extracellular juxtamembrane (JM) and intracellular cytoplasmic (CYT) domains. ErbB4 plays a critical role in cardiac and neural development. We demonstrated that ErbB4 is expressed in the ureteric buds and developing tubules of embryonic rat kidney and in collecting ducts in adult. The predominant isoforms expressed in kidney are JM-a and CYT-2. In ErbB4-transfected MDCK II cells, basal cell proliferation and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced tubule formation were decreased by all four isoforms. Only JM-a/CYT-2 cells formed tubules upon HB-EGF stimulation. ErbB4 was activated by both HRG-beta1 and HB-EGF stimulation; however, compared with HRG-beta1, HB-EGF induced phosphorylation of the 80-kDa cytoplasmic cleavage fragment of the JM-a/CYT-2 isoform. HB-EGF also induced early activation of ERK1/2 in JM-a/CYT-2 cells and promoted nuclear translocation of the JM-a/CYT-2 cytoplasmic tail. In summary, our data indicate that JM-a/CYT-2, the ErbB4 isoform that is proteinase cleavable but does not contain a PI3K-binding domain in its cytoplasmic tail, mediates important functions in renal epithelial cells in response to HB-EGF.",M2
17761519,"Self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells requires insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and ERBB2 receptor signaling.Despite progress in developing defined conditions for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) cultures, little is known about the cell-surface receptors that are activated under conditions supportive of hESC self-renewal. A simultaneous interrogation of 42 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in hESCs following stimulation with mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) conditioned medium (CM) revealed rapid and prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R); less prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members, including ERBB2 and ERBB3; and trace phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptors. Intense IGF1R and IR phosphorylation occurred in the absence of MEF conditioning (NCM) and was attributable to high concentrations of insulin in the proprietary KnockOut Serum Replacer (KSR). Inhibition of IGF1R using a blocking antibody or lentivirus-delivered shRNA reduced hESC self-renewal and promoted differentiation, while disruption of ERBB2 signaling with the selective inhibitor AG825 severely inhibited hESC proliferation and promoted apoptosis. A simple defined medium containing an IGF1 analog, <e>heregulin</e>-1beta (a ligand for ERBB2/ERBB3), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), and activin A supported long-term growth of multiple hESC lines. These studies identify previously unappreciated RTKs that support hESC proliferation and self-renewal, and provide a rationally designed medium for the growth and maintenance of pluripotent hESCs.",M2
17692845,"<e>Heregulin</e>-induced epigenetic regulation of the utrophin-A promoter.Utrophin is the autosomal homolog of dystrophin, the product of the Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) locus. Utrophin is of therapeutic interest since its over-expression can compensate dystrophin's absence. Utrophin is enriched at neuromuscular junctions due to heregulin-mediated utrophin-A promoter activation. We demonstrate that heregulin activated MSK1/2 and phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 10 in cultured C2C12 muscle cells, in an ERK-dependent manner. MSK1/2 inhibition suppressed heregulin-mediated utrophin-A activation. MSK1 over-expression potentiated heregulin-mediated utrophin-A activation and chromatin remodeling at the utrophin-A promoter. These results identify MSK1/2 as key effectors modulating utrophin-A expression as well as identify novel targets for DMD therapy.",M2
17686159,"<e>Heregulin</e> beta1 drives gefitinib-resistant growth and invasion in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells.INTRODUCTION: Resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) therapies is an emerging clinical problem. The efficacy of anti-EGFR therapies can be influenced by the presence of heregulins (HRGs), which can bind erbB3/4 receptors and can activate alternative signalling pathways. In the present study we have examined whether HRG signalling can circumvent EGFR blockade in an EGFR-positive tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 (Tam-R) breast cancer cell line. METHODS: Tam-R cells, incubated with the selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib ('Iressa', ZD1839), were exposed to HRGbeta1 and the effects on erbB receptor dimerization profiles and on activation of associated downstream signalling components were assessed by immunoprecipitation, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. The effects of HRGbeta1 on gefitinib-treated Tam-R cell growth and invasion were also examined, and HRGbeta1 expression levels were assessed in breast cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry to address the potential clinical relevance of such a resistance mechanism. RESULTS: In Tam-R cells, HRGbeta1 promoted erbB3/erbB2 and erbB3/EGFR heterodimerization, promoted ERK1/2 and AKT pathway activation and increased cell proliferation and invasion. Gefitinib prevented HRGbeta1-driven erbB3/EGFR heterodimerization, ERK1/2 activation and Tam-R cell proliferation, but HRGbeta1-driven erbB3/erbB2 heterodimerization, AKT activation and Tam-R cell invasion were maintained. A combination of gefitinib and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 effectively blocked HRGbeta1-mediated intracellular signalling activity, growth and invasion in Tam-R cells. Similarly, targeting erbB2 with trastuzumab in combination with gefitinib in Tam-R cells reduced HRGbeta1-induced erbB2 and ERK1/2 activity; however, HRGbeta1-driven AKT activity and cell growth were maintained while cell invasion was significantly enhanced with this combination. In clinical tissue all samples demonstrated cytoplasmic tumour epithelial HRGbeta1 protein staining, with expression correlating with EGFR positivity and activation of both AKT and ERK1/2. CONCLUSION: HRGbeta1 can overcome the inhibitory effects of gefitinib on cell growth and invasion in Tam-R cells through promotion of erbB3/erbB2 heterodimerization and activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signalling pathway. This may have implications for the effectiveness of anti-EGFR therapies in breast cancer as HRGbeta1 is enriched in many EGFR-positive breast tumours.",M2
17678625,"Activation of MEK-ERK by <e>heregulin</e>-beta1 promotes the development of cardiomyocytes derived from ES cells.We have previously shown that heregulin-beta1 (HRG-beta1) was involved in the development and survival of cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells. This study was conducted to investigate the intracellular signal mechanisms by which HRG-beta1 stimulates cardiogenesis in ES cells. The treatment with ErbB receptor inhibitor decreased the population of cardiomyocytes and transcripts levels of cardiac genes (Nkx2.5, beta-MHC, cTnI, and MLC2a). The phosphorylation of ERK and development of cardiomyocytes by treatment with HRG-beta1 was suppressed upon treatment with MEK1 inhibitor. Furthermore, cardiomyocytes and level of MHC protein were significantly increased by overexpression of wild type MEK1 or constitutive active MEK1, but not dominant negative MEK1. These results suggest that HRG-beta1 promotes the development of cardiomyocytes predominantly by activation of MEK-ERK.",M2
17652160,"Mapping ErbB receptors on breast cancer cell membranes during signal transduction.Distributions of ErbB receptors on membranes of SKBR3 breast cancer cells were mapped by immunoelectron microscopy. The most abundant receptor, ErbB2, is phosphorylated, clustered and active. Kinase inhibitors ablate ErbB2 phosphorylation without dispersing clusters. Modest co-clustering of ErbB2 and EGFR, even after EGF treatment, suggests that both are predominantly involved in homointeractions. <e>Heregulin</e> leads to dramatic clusters of ErbB3 that contain some ErbB2 and EGFR and abundant PI 3-kinase. Other docking proteins, such as Shc and STAT5, respond differently to receptor activation. Levels of Shc at the membrane increase two- to five-fold with EGF, whereas pre-associated STAT5 becomes strongly phosphorylated. These data suggest that the distinct topography of receptors and their docking partners modulates signaling activities.",M2
17651959,"Resveratrol inhibits <e>heregulin</e>-beta1-mediated matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression and cell invasion in human breast cancer cells.The growth factor heregulin-beta1 (HRG-beta1), which is expressed in breast cancer, activates the HER-2 signaling pathway through induction of heterodimeric complexes of HER-2 with HER-3 or HER-4. It has been shown in many studies that HRG-beta1 induces the tumorigenicity and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 is a key enzyme in the degradation of extracellular matrices, and its expression may be dysregulated in breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Resveratrol, a major component in grape, exhibited potential anticarcinogenic activities in both in vitro and in vivo studies. However, the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on HER-2-mediated expression of MMP-9 has not been demonstrated yet. In the present study, we investigated the anti-invasive mechanism of resveratrol in human breast cancer cells. Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were exposed to resveratrol (2, 5 and 10 microM). The expression activity of MMP-9 was measured by zymogram analysis. Phosphorylated levels of HER-2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK were measured by Western blot analysis. Total actin was used as internal control for protein expression. HRG-beta1 induced the phosphorylation of HER-2/neu receptor and MMP-9 expression in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Resveratrol significantly inhibited HRG-beta1-mediated MMP-9 expression in human breast cancer cells. MEK inhibitor induced a marked reduction in MMP-9 expression, and it suggested that ERK1/2 cascade could play an important role in HRG-beta1-mediated MMP-9 expression. Furthermore, resveratrol significantly suppressed HRG-beta1-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and invasion of breast cancer cells. However, resveratrol had negligible effects on either HRG-beta1-mediated phosphorylation of HER-2 receptor or expression of the tissue inhibitor of MMP, tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase protein 1. Taken together, our results suggest that resveratrol inhibited MMP-9 expression in human breast cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of resveratrol on MMP-9 expression and invasion of breast cancer cells are, in part, associated with the down-regulation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.",M2
17638867,"HER4 D-box sequences regulate mitotic progression and degradation of the nuclear HER4 cleavage product s80HER4.<e>Heregulin</e>-mediated activation of HER4 initiates receptor cleavage (releasing an 80-kDa HER4 intracellular domain, s80(HER4), containing nuclear localization sequences) and results in G(2)-M delay by unknown signaling mechanisms. We report herein that s80(HER4) contains a functional cyclin B-like sequence known as a D-box, which targets proteins for degradation by anaphase-promoting complex (APC)/cyclosome, a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase. s80(HER4) ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation occurred during mitosis but not during S phase. Inhibition of an APC subunit (APC2) using short interfering RNA knockdown impaired s80(HER4) degradation. Mutation of the s80(HER4) D-box sequence stabilized s80(HER4) during mitosis, and s80(HER4)-dependent growth inhibition via G(2)-M delay was significantly greater with the D-box mutant. Polyomavirus middle T antigen-transformed HC11 cells expressing s80(HER4) resulted in smaller, less proliferative, more differentiated tumors in vivo than those expressing kinase-dead s80(HER4) or the empty vector. Cells expressing s80(HER4) with a disrupted D-box did not form tumors, instead forming differentiated ductal structures. These results suggest that cell cycle-dependent degradation of s80(HER4) limits its growth-inhibitory action, and stabilization of s80(HER4) enhances tumor suppression, thus providing a link between HER4-mediated growth inhibition and cell cycle control.",M2
17627612,"Pertuzumab, a novel HER dimerization inhibitor, inhibits the growth of human lung cancer cells mediated by the HER3 signaling pathway.A humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody pertuzumab (Omnitarg, 2C4), binding to a different HER2 epitope than trastuzumab, is known as an inhibitor of heterodimerization of the HER receptors. Potent antitumor activity against HER2-expressing breast and prostate cancer cell lines has been clarified, but this potential is not clear against lung cancers. The authors investigated the in vitro anti-tumor activity of pertuzumab against eight non-small cell lung cancer cells expressing various members of the HER receptors. A lung cancer 11_18 cell line expressed a large amount of HER2 and HER3, and its cell growth was stimulated by an HER3 ligand, <e>heregulin</e> (HRG)-alpha. Pertuzumab significantly inhibited the HRG-alpha-stimulated cellular growth of the 11_18 cells. Pertuzumab blocked HRG-alpha-stimulated phosphorylation of HER3, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Akt. In contrast, pertuzumab failed to block epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated phosphorylation of EGF receptor (EGFR) and MAPK. Immunoprecipitation showed that pertuzumab inhibited HRG-alpha-stimulated HER2/HER3 heterodimer formation. HRG-alpha-stimulated HER3 phosphorylation was also observed in the PC-9 cells co-overexpressing EGFR, HER2, and HER3, but the cell growth was neither stimulated by HRG-alpha nor inhibited by pertuzumab. The present results suggest that pertuzumab is effective against HRG-alpha-dependent cell growth in lung cancer cells through inhibition of HRG-alpha-stimulated HER2/HER3 signaling.",M2
17619951,"<e>Heregulin</e> protects mesenchymal stem cells from serum deprivation and hypoxia-induced apoptosis.Heregulin can regulate the survival of cardiomyocytes, epithelial cells, neuron, glial cells, and other cell types through binding with the ErbB receptors. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of heregulin (HRG) on the apoptosis of Bone marrow Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We used the MSCs from adult Sprague-Dawley rats and the model of serum deprivation (SD) and hypoxia-induced apoptosis. The apoptosis was detected by TUNEL method. The apoptosis of MSCs significantly increased 12 h or 18 h after SD and hypoxia, but treatment with HRG significantly decreased the apoptosis induced by SD and hypoxia. Tyrphostin AG1478 (ErbB3/4 inhibitor) or Tyrphostin AG825 (ErbB2 inhibitor) could block this effects of HRG. Akt and ERK were activated by HRG under SD and hypoxia conditions, but HRG had no effects on the activation of JNK and p38. HRG also increased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and decreased the activation of caspase3 induced by SD and hypoxia. These results suggested HRG could decrease the apoptosis of MSCs induced by SD and hypoxia through the activation of Akt and ERK, the increase of Bcl-2/Bax ratio and the inhibition of caspase3 activation.",M2
17539658,"Tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate suppresses <e>heregulin</e>-beta1-induced fatty acid synthase expression in human breast cancer cells by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade signaling.Tumor-associated fatty acid synthase (FAS) is implicated in tumorigenesis and connected to HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) by systemic analyses. Suppression of FAS in cancer cells may lead to growth inhibition and cell apoptosis. Our previous study demonstrated that (-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), the green tea catechin, could down-regulate FAS expression by suppressing EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) signaling and downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Herein, we examined the effects of EGCG on FAS expression modulated by another member of the erbB family, that is, HER2 or HER3. We identified that heregulin-beta1 (HRG-beta1), a HER3 ligand, stimulated dose-dependent FAS expression in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and AU565, but not MDA-MB-453. The time-dependent increase in FAS expression after HRG-beta1 stimulation was also observed in MCF-7 cells, and this up-regulation was de novo RNA synthesis dependent. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with EGCG markedly inhibited HRG-beta1-dependent induction of mRNA and protein of FAS. EGCG also decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 that were demonstrated as selected downstream HRG-beta1-responsive kinases required for FAS expression using dominant-negative Akt, PI3K inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin), or MEK inhibitor (PD98059). FAS induction by HRG-beta1 was also blocked by AG825, a selective HER2 inhibitor, and by genistein, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, indicating the formation of a heterodimer between HER2 and HER3, and their tyrosine kinase activities are essential for HRG-beta1-mediated elevation of FAS. Additionally, growth inhibition of HRG-beta1-treated cells was parallel to suppression of FAS by EGCG. Taken together, these findings extend our previous study to indicate that EGCG may be useful in the chemoprevention of breast carcinoma in which FAS overexpression results from HER2 or/and HER3 signaling.",M2
17530167,"Role of <e>heregulin</e> in human cancer.Heregulin (HRG) is a soluble secreted growth factor, which, upon binding and activation of ErbB3 and ErbB4 transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases, is involved in cell proliferation, invasion, survival and differentiation of normal and malignant tissues. The HRG gene family consists of four members: HRG-1, HRG-2, HRG-3 and HRG-4, of which a multitude of different isoforms are synthesized by alternative exon splicing, showing various tissue distribution and biological activities. Disruption of the physiological balance between HRG ligands and their ErbB receptors is implicated in the formation of a variety of human cancers.

17505063,"The HER4 cytoplasmic domain, but not its C terminus, inhibits mammary cell proliferation.Unlike the proliferative action of other epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family members, HER4/ErbB4 is often associated with growth-inhibitory and differentiation signaling. These actions may involve HER4 two-step proteolytic processing by intramembraneous gamma-secretase, releasing the soluble, intracellular 80-kDa HER4 cytoplasmic domain, s80HER4. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of either gamma-secretase activity or HER4 tyrosine kinase activity blocked <e>heregulin</e>-dependent growth inhibition of SUM44 breast cancer cells. We next generated breast cell lines stably expressing GFP-s80HER4 [green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N terminus of the HER4 cytoplasmic domain, residues 676-1308], GFP-CT(HER4) (GFP fused to N terminus of the HER4 C-terminus distal to the tyrosine kinase domain, residues 989-1308), or GFP alone. Both GFP-s80HER4 and GFP-CTHER4 were found in the nucleus, but GFP-s80HER4 accumulated to a greater extent and sustained its nuclear localization. s80HER4 was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated, and treatment of cells with a specific HER family tyrosine kinase inhibitor 1) blocked tyrosine phosphorylation; 2) markedly diminished GFP-s80HER4 nuclear localization; and 3) reduced signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5A tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear localization as well as GFP-s80HER4:STAT5A interaction. Multiple normal mammary and breast cancer cell lines, stably expressing GFP-s80HER4 (SUM44, MDA-MB-453, MCF10A, SUM102, and HC11) were growth inhibited compared with the same cell line expressing GFP-CTHER4 or GFP alone. The s80HER4-induced cell number reduction was due to slower growth because rates of apoptosis were equivalent in GFP-, GFP-CTHER4-, and GFP-s80HER4-expressing cells. Lastly, GFP-s80HER4 enhanced differentiation signaling as indicated by increased basal and prolactin-dependent beta-casein expression. These results indicate that surface HER4 tyrosine phosphorylation and ligand-dependent release of s80HER4 are necessary, and s80HER4 signaling is sufficient for HER4-dependent growth inhibition.",M2
17494760,"Activated Cdc42-associated kinase Ack1 promotes prostate cancer progression via androgen receptor tyrosine phosphorylation.Activation of the androgen receptor (AR) may play a role in androgen-independent progression of prostate cancer. Multiple mechanisms of AR activation, including stimulation by tyrosine kinases, have been postulated. We and others have recently shown involvement of activated Cdc42-associated tyrosine kinase Ack1 in advanced human prostate cancer. Here we provide the molecular basis for interplay between Ack1 and AR in prostate cancer cells. Activated Ack1 promoted androgen-independent growth of LNCaP and LAPC-4 prostate xenograft tumors, AR recruitment to the androgen-responsive enhancer, and androgen-inducible gene expression in the absence of androgen. <e>Heregulin</e>-stimulated HER2 activation induced Ack1 activation and AR tyrosine phosphorylation. Ack1 knockdown inhibited heregulin-dependent AR tyrosine phosphorylation, AR reporter activity, androgen-stimulated gene expression, and AR recruitment. Ack1 was recruited to the androgen-responsive enhancers after androgen and heregulin stimulation. In 8 of 18 primary androgen-independent prostate tumor samples, tyrosine-phosphorylated AR protein was detected and correlated with the detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated Ack1. Neither was elevated in androgen-dependent tumors or benign prostate samples. Activated Ack1 phosphorylated AR protein at Tyr-267 and Tyr-363, both located within the transactivation domain. Mutation of Tyr-267 completely abrogated and mutation of Tyr-363 reduced Ack1-induced AR reporter activation and recruitment of AR to the androgen-responsive enhancer. Expression of AR point mutants inhibited Ack1-driven xenograft tumor growth. Thus, Ack1 activated by surface signals or oncogenic mechanisms may directly enhance AR transcriptional function and promote androgen-independent progression of prostate cancer. Targeting the Ack1 kinase may be a potential therapeutic strategy in prostate cancer.",M2
17483331,"Breast tumor kinase (protein tyrosine kinase 6) regulates <e>heregulin</e>-induced activation of ERK5 and p38 MAP kinases in breast cancer cells.Total tyrosine kinase activity is often elevated in both cytosolic and membrane fractions of malignant breast tissue and correlates with a decrease in disease-free survival. Breast tumor kinase (Brk; protein tyrosine kinase 6) is a soluble tyrosine kinase that was cloned from a metastatic breast tumor and found to be overexpressed in a majority of breast tumors. Herein, we show that Brk is overexpressed in 86% of invasive ductal breast tumors and coexpressed with ErbB family members in breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, the ErbB ligand, heregulin, activates Brk kinase activity. Knockdown of Brk by stable expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in T47D breast cancer cells decreases proliferation and blocks epidermal growth factor (EGF)- and heregulin-induced activation of Rac GTPase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 5, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but not Akt, ERK1/2, or c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase. Furthermore, EGF- and heregulin-induced cyclin D1 expression is dependent on p38 signaling and inhibited by Brk shRNA knockdown. The myocyte enhancer factor 2 transcription factor target of p38 MAPK and ERK5 signaling is also sensitive to altered Brk expression. Finally, heregulin-induced migration of T47D cells requires p38 MAPK activity and is blocked by Brk knockdown. These results place Brk in a novel signaling pathway downstream of ErbB receptors and upstream of Rac, p38 MAPK, and ERK5 and establish the ErbB-Brk-Rac-p38 MAPK pathway as a critical mediator of breast cancer cell migration.",M2
17473376,"Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) inhibits ErbB3 signaling in prostate cancer cells.Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a flavonoid found in licorice, shallot, and bean sprouts, has been identified as a potent anti-tumor promoting agent. We previously demonstrated that ISL reduces cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in DU145 human prostate cancer cells and MAT-LyLu (MLL) rat prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of members of the ErbB receptor family is a frequently observed event in several human cancers, and ErbB receptors currently constitute the primary targets of anticancer strategies. In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the ISL regulation of prostate cancer cell proliferation, the present study attempted to determine whether ISL inhibits <e>heregulin</e> (HRG)-beta-induced ErbB3 signaling. DU145 and MLL cells were cultured in serum-free medium with ISL and/or HRG-beta. Exogenous HRG-beta alone was shown to effect an increase in the numbers of viable cells, whereas HRG-beta did not counteract the ISL-induced growth inhibition. ISL reduced the protein and mRNA levels of ErbB3 in a dose-dependent manner, but exerted no effect on HRG protein levels. Immunoprecipitation/Western blot studies indicated that ISL inhibited the HRG-beta-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3, the recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to ErbB3, and Akt phosphorylation in DU145 cells. These results indicate that ISL inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, at least in part, via the inhibition of ErbB3 signaling and the PI3K/Akt pathway.",M2
17428466,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling enhances nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of BRCA1.Signaling pathways involved in regulating nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of BRCA1 have not been previously reported. Here, we provide evidence that <e>heregulin</e> beta1-induced activation of the Akt pathway increases the nuclear content of BRCA1. First, treatment of T47D breast cancer cells with heregulin beta1 results in a two-fold increase in nuclear BRCA1 as assessed by FACS analysis, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. This heregulin-induced increase in nuclear BRCA1 is blocked by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of Akt. Second, mutation of threonine 509 in BRCA1, the site of Akt phosphorylation, to an alanine, attenuates the ability of heregulin to induce BRCA1 nuclear accumulation. These data suggest that Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation of BRCA1 is required for the heregulin-regulated nuclear concentration of BRCA1. Because most functions ascribed to BRCA1 occur within the nucleus, we postulated that phosphorylation-dependent nuclear accumulation of BRCA1 would result in enhanced nuclear activity, specifically transcriptional activity, of BRCA1. This postulate is affirmed by our observation that the ability of BRCA1 to transactivate GADD45 promoter constructs was enhanced in T47D cells treated with heregulin beta1. Furthermore, the heterologous expression of BRCA1 in HCC1937 human breast cancer cells, which have constitutively active Akt, also induces GADD45 promoter activity, whereas the expression of BRCA1 in which threonine 509 has been mutated to an alanine is able to only minimally induce promoter activity. These findings implicate Akt in upstream events leading to BRCA1 nuclear localization and function.",M2
17332320,"The Asn418-linked N-glycan of ErbB3 plays a crucial role in preventing spontaneous heterodimerization and tumor promotion.ErbB2 and ErbB3, two members of the ErbB family, form a high-affinity <e>heregulin</e> coreceptor that elicits potent mitogenic and transforming signals, and clinical studies indicate that these receptors play an important role in tumor incidence and progression. To determine whether N-glycosylation is involved in the function of ErbB3, a series of human ErbB3 molecules devoid of N-glycans were prepared and transfected to Flp-In-CHO cells for stable expression. A cross-linking study showed that the Asn(418) to Gln mutant (N418Q) of ErbB3 underwent autodimerization without its ligand, heregulin. The wild-type or N418Q mutant of ErbB3 was next coexpressed with ErbB2 in Flp-In-CHO cells, and the effect of N-glycan on heterodimerization was examined. The N418Q mutant of ErbB3 was autodimerized with ErbB2 without ligand stimulation, and receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt phosphorylation were promoted in the absence of heregulin. A cell proliferation assay and a soft agar colony formation assay showed that the N418Q mutant of ErbB3 coexpressed with ErbB2 promoted cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar in an ERK- and Akt-dependent manner. The mutation also promoted the growth of tumors in athymic mice when injected s.c. These findings suggest that the Asn(418)-linked N-glycan in ErbB3 plays an essential role in regulating receptor heterodimerization with ErbB2 and might have an effect on transforming activity.",M2
17237269,"Sensitivity to pertuzumab (2C4) in ovarian cancer models: cross-talk with estrogen receptor signaling.Pertuzumab (Omnitarg, rhuMab 2C4) is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which inhibits HER2 dimerization. Because it has shown some clinical activity in ovarian cancer, this study sought to identify predictors of response to this agent in a model of ovarian cancer. A panel of 13 ovarian cancer cell lines was treated with <e>heregulin</e> beta1 (HRGbeta1) or transforming growth factor-alpha, and cell proliferation was assessed. Both agents increased cell number in the majority of cell lines studied, the response to both being similar (r = 0.83; P = 0.0004, Pearson test). HRGbeta1 stimulation could be partially reversed by pertuzumab in 6 of 13 cell lines, with complete reversal in PE04 and PE06 cells. Addition of pertuzumab to transforming growth factor-alpha-stimulated cells produced growth inhibition in 3 of 13 cell lines (PE01, PE04, and PE06). The magnitude of HRGbeta1-driven growth stimulation correlated significantly with an increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (P = 0.037) but not Akt (P = 0.99) phosphorylation. Such HRGbeta1-driven phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and Akt could be reduced with pertuzumab, accompanied by changes in cell cycle distribution. In cell lines responsive to pertuzumab, HRGbeta1-enhanced phosphorylation of HER2 (Tyr(877)) was reduced. Estrogen-stimulated changes in growth, cell cycle distribution, and signaling were reversed by pertuzumab, indicating cross-talk between HER2 and estrogen signaling. These data indicate that there is a subset of ovarian cancer cell lines sensitive to pertuzumab and suggest possible predictors of response to identify patients who could benefit from this therapy. Furthermore, we have identified an interaction between HER2 and estrogen signaling in this disease.",M2
17173075,"c-Src modulates ErbB2 and ErbB3 heterocomplex formation and function.Overexpression and/or gene amplification of c-Src and members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB) family have been implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Although members of the EGFR family are known to form heterocomplexes with one another, c-Src has also been shown to physically interact with members of this family in breast cancer cell lines and tumors. This paper investigates the role of c-Src in modulating the physical and functional interaction between ErbB2 and ErbB3, two family members that preferentially associate with one another and together exhibit high oncogenic potential. We show that overexpressed wild-type c-Src enhances heterocomplex formation of ErbB2 and ErbB3 that results in increased basal and/or <e>heregulin</e>-induced activation of receptors, and their downstream intracellular effectors. Expression of a kinase-inactive form of c-Src (K(-) c-Src) or pharmacological inhibition of c-Src by PP2 negatively affects these events. Furthermore, cellular motility and anchorage-independent growth promoted by the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterocomplex are dependent upon c-Src, as demonstrated by the effects of K(-) c-Src overexpression or treatment with PP2. In contrast to previous studies that defined a role for c-Src downstream of ErbB2/ErbB3, the current work suggests an upstream mechanism, whereby c-Src enhances ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling and biological functions by positively modulating the association between ErbB2 and ErbB3.",M2
17142811,"Quantitative transcriptional control of ErbB receptor signaling undergoes graded to biphasic response for cell differentiation.ErbB receptor ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and <e>heregulin</e> (HRG), induce dose-dependent transient and sustained intracellular signaling, proliferation, and differentiation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, respectively. In an effort to delineate the ligand-specific cell determination mechanism, we investigated time course gene expressions induced by EGF and HRG that induce distinct cellular phenotypes in MCF-7 cells. To analyze independently the effects of ligand dosage and time for gene expression, we developed a statistical method for estimating the two effects. Our results indicated that signal transduction pathways convey quantitative properties of the dose-dependent activation of ErbB receptor to early transcription. The results also implied that moderate changes in the expression levels of a number of genes, not the predominant regulation of a few specific genes, might cooperatively work at the early stage of the transcription for determining cell fate. However, the EGF- and HRG-induced distinct signal durations resulted in the ligand-oriented biphasic induction of proteins after 20 min. The selected gene list and HRG-induced prolonged signaling suggested that transcriptional feedback to the intracellular signaling results in a graded to biphasic response in the cell determination process and that each ErbB receptor is inextricably responsible for the control of amplitude and duration of cellular biochemical reactions.",M2
17088999,"MEK ablation in MCF-7 cells blocks DNA synthesis induced by serum, but not by estradiol or growth factors.The role of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) signaling in estrogen receptor positive (ER(+)) MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells is not well understood. We depleted MEK by cotransfection of MEK1 and MEK2 siRNA duplexes in a MCF-7 derived line (MCF-7/ lacZ, ML-20) and determined its effect on serum, 17beta-estradiol (E(2)), and growth factor induced DNA synthesis. MEK knockdown did not decrease fetal bovine serum-induced DNA synthesis in ML-20 cells although it did inhibit DNA synthesis induced by estrogen-stripped calf serum (CCS) suggesting that MEK activation plays an important role in growth signaling induced by serum components other than estrogen. Consistent with this notion, MEK knockdown only modestly decreased DNA synthesis induced by E(2)-supplemented CCS medium in ML-20 cells. Similarly, MEK knockdown only caused moderate decreases in DNA synthesis induced by fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) or <e>heregulin</e>-beta1 (HRGbeta1) in this media. Also, there were only minimal effects of MEK knockdown in cells treated with growth factor-supplemented serum-free medium. Although MEK depletion inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by CCS in these cells, that induced by growth factor supplemented CCS media was relatively unaffected. Similarly, ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by growth factor-supplemented serum-free media was also relatively unaffected by MEK depletion. These results suggest that pathways regulating DNA synthesis induced by serum in MCF-7 cells are significantly more dependent on constitutive MEK levels than that induced by E(2) or growth factors.",M2
17016520,"Effects of HER2 overexpression on cell signaling networks governing proliferation and migration.Although human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression is implicated in tumor progression for a variety of cancer types, how it dysregulates signaling networks governing cell behavioral functions is poorly understood. To address this problem, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to analyze dynamic effects of HER2 overexpression on phosphotyrosine signaling in human mammary epithelial cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or <e>heregulin</e> (HRG). Data generated from this analysis reveal that EGF stimulation of HER2-overexpressing cells activates multiple signaling pathways to stimulate migration, whereas HRG stimulation of these cells results in amplification of a specific subset of the migration signaling network. Self-organizing map analysis of the phosphoproteomic data set permitted elucidation of network modules differentially regulated in HER2-overexpressing cells in comparison with parental cells for EGF and HRG treatment. Partial least-squares regression analysis of the same data set identified quantitative combinations of signals within the networks that strongly correlate with cell proliferation and migration measured under the same battery of conditions. Combining these modeling approaches enabled association of epidermal growth factor receptor family dimerization to activation of specific phosphorylation sites, which appear to most critically regulate proliferation and/or migration.",M2
17004114,"Bad expression predicts outcome in patients treated with tamoxifen.AIMS: Activation of the PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway has been linked to endocrine resistance in tamoxifen treated breast cancer patients. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway causes phosphorylation of Bad leading to modulation of cellular apoptosis. The present study was carried out to test the hypothesis that disruption of apoptosis in breast cancer, via Akt activation, is linked with hormone resistance. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 402 oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancers using antibodies against Bad, pBad (ser 112), Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Bax. RESULTS: Bad, pBad (ser 112), Bcl-2 and Bax expression was observed in the cellular cytoplasmic compartment only. Patients, whose tumours had high levels of Bad expression, had a significantly improved disease-free survival when compared to patients whose tumours had low levels of Bad expression (P = 0.049). Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by either <e>heregulin</e> or oestrogen had no effect on expression of Bad, Bcl-2, Bax or Bcl-xl. However, heregulin increased pBad (ser 112) expression. DISCUSSION: Data presented here shows that Bad expression is associated with relapse in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients, supporting our hypothesis that the apoptosis pathway is involved in tamoxifen resistance.",M2
16983832,"Computational modelling of ErbB family phosphorylation dynamics in response to transforming growth factor alpha and <e>heregulin</e> indicates spatial compartmentation of phosphatase activity.Members of the ErbB receptor family are associated with several cancers and appear to be providing useful targets for pharmacological therapeutics for tumours of the lung and breast. Further improvements of these therapies may be guided by a quantitative, dynamic integrative systems understanding of the complexities of ErbB dimerisation, trafficking and activation, for it is these complexities that render difficult intuiting how perturbations such as drug intervention will affect ErbB signalling activities. Towards this goal, we have developed a computational model implementing commonly accepted principles governing ErbB receptor interaction, trafficking, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Using this model, we are able to investigate several hypotheses regarding the compartmental localisation of dephosphorylation. Model results applied to experimental data on ErbB 1, ErbB2 and ErbB3 phosphorylation in H292 human lung carcinoma cells support a hypothesis that key dephosphorylation activity for these receptors occurs largely in an intracellular, endosomal compartment rather than at the cell surface plasma membrane. Thus, the endocytic trafficking-related compartmentalisation of dephosphorylation may define a critical aspect of the ErbB signalling response to ligand.",M2
16914727,"<e>Heregulin</e>-dependent delay in mitotic progression requires HER4 and BRCA1.HER4 expression in human breast cancers correlates with a positive prognosis. While heregulin inhibits the growth of HER4-positive breast cancer cells, it does so by undefined mechanisms. We demonstrate that heregulin-induced HER4 activity inhibits cell proliferation and delays G(2)/M progression of breast cancer cells. While investigating pathways of G(2)/M delay, we noted that heregulin increased the expression of BRCA1 in a HER4-dependent, HER2-independent manner. Induction of BRCA1 by HER4 occurred independently of the cell cycle. Moreover, BRCA1 expression was elevated in HER4-postive human breast cancer specimens. Heregulin stimulated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and pharmacologic inhibition of JNK impaired heregulin-enhanced expression of BRCA1 and mitotic delay; inhibition of Erk1/2 did not. Knockdown of BRCA1 with small interfering RNA in a human breast cancer cell line interfered with HER4-mediated mitotic delay. Heregulin/HER4-dependent mitotic delay was examined further with an isogenic pair of mouse mammary epithelial cells (MECs) derived from mice harboring homozygous LoxP sites flanking exon 11 of BRCA1, such that one cell line expressed BRCA1 while the other cell line, after Cre-mediated excision, did not. BRCA1-positive MECs displayed heregulin-dependent mitotic delay; however, the isogenic BRCA1-negative MECs did not. These results suggest that heregulin-mediated growth inhibition in HER4-postive breast cancer cells requires BRCA1.",M2
16847284,"Trastuzumab in combination with <e>heregulin</e>-activated Her-2 (erbB-2) triggers a receptor-enhanced chemosensitivity effect in the absence of Her-2 overexpression.PURPOSE: The decision for treating breast cancer patients with trastuzumab is based on HER-2 amplification and/or overexpression. METHODS: Using MCF-7 cells (Her-2 +/-) engineered to overexpress heregulin (MCF-7/HRG), a ligand for the Her-2/3/4 network, we investigated whether HRG-induced transactivation of Her-2 affected breast cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy and whether trastuzumab trigger receptor-enhanced chemosensitivity (REC) when combined with chemotherapy without Her-2 overexpression. RESULTS: MCF-7/HRG cells were more than 10-fold resistant to the alkylating agent cisplatin (CDDP), while trastuzumab coexposure completely reversed HRG-promoted CDDP resistance. A synergistic interaction between trastuzumab in combination with CDDP (paclitaxel or vincristine) was obtained in MCF-7/HRG cells. Trastuzumab prevented activation of the antiapoptotic and proliferative cascades and inhibited HRG-induced Her-2/3 phosphorylation. CDDP efficacy was enhanced by trastuzumab in cells expressing endogenously high levels of HRG. Conversely, trastuzumab coexposure was ineffective in enhancing chemotherapy efficacy in cells that did not secrete HRG, such as MCF-7 cells overexpressing a structural mutated HRG isoform. Therefore, trastuzumab-induced REC, in the absence of Her-2 overexpression, occurs through the kinase activity of Her-2/3. Interestingly, HRG expression in tumor biopsies from invasive breast carcinomas (n = 189) revealed that, whereas the minority (12%) of Her-2 positive tumors (n = 60; 32%) demonstrated Her-2 phosphorylation, the majority (67%) of HRG-overexpressing and Her-2 tumors (n = 57; 30%) were in active Her-2 status. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that assessment of HRG expression and Her-2 activation define a particular breast cancer patient population for which trastuzumab plus CDDP or taxol are extremely efficient without Her-2 overexpression.",M2
16788833,"Purification and in vitro characterization of adult canine olfactory ensheathing cells.Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are known to promote neural repair under experimental conditions. The experimental focus has so far been almost entirely on rodent OECs (rOECs), and hence whether human OECs (humOECs) display similar properties is unclear. Studies on larger mammals as an  intermediate  model may be helpful for translating the experimental evidence gathered so far into novel therapeutic strategies. In the present study, we purified adult canine OECs (caOECs) from the olfactory bulb and analyzed their in vitro properties with respect to antigen expression, proliferation, and differentiation. Secondary caOECs shared the expression of marker molecules and the reactivity toward growth factors, with rOECs and humOECs. CaOECs were positively immunostained for the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75, GFAP, and O4 and proliferated in response to fibroblast growth factor-2 and <e>heregulin</e>-1beta. No decline in proliferation was noted at higher passages (&gt;8). The effects of forskolin, which neither increased proliferation nor stimulated the expression of O4, were clearly different from those on rOECs. Moreover, caOECs displayed their typical spindle-shaped morphology only upon growth factor/forskolin addition, whereas mitotically quiescent caOECs had a flattened morphology. Thus, caOECs can readily be purified from adult canine olfactory bulb and expanded by using established OEC mitogens. The behavior of caOECs toward forskolin suggests that caOECs and humOECs share a number of properties amd implies the presence of common intracellular signalling pathways. CaOECs therefore represent a suitable model system relevant for humOECs in neural repair studies.",M2
16774841,"<e>Heregulin</e>, cysteine rich-61 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques: relationship with clinical data.OBJECTIVES: Heregulins (HRGs) are known to induce expression of angiogenic factors such as cysteine rich-61 (CYR61) and collectively to promote neoangiogenesis. Along with extracellular matrix remodelling, mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), these factors are important in atherogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate HRG, CYR61 and MMP-9 expression and their relationship with clinical and histopathological findings in carotid occlusive disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens of human carotid atherosclerotic plaque (n=90) were obtained by endarterectomy. Expression of HRG, CYR61 and MMP-9 was assessed by immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis. Associations between protein expression and degree of carotid stenosis, presence of symptoms, presence of an infarct in CT scan and carotid plaque histopathology were investigated. RESULTS: An increase in HRG, CYR61 and MMP-9 expression was found, particularly in neovascularized regions of the plaques. High HRG expression was associated with the degree of carotid stenosis (p=0.028) and plaque histopathology (p=0.002). More than half of specimens from plaques with &gt;90% stenosis had intense expression of CYR61 (p=0.047). Increased expression of MMP-9 was associated with degree of stenosis and presence of cerebral infarct on CT scan (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: HRG, CYR61 and MMP-9 are highly expressed in human atherosclerotic carotid plaques. The association with the degree of stenosis and/or plaque histopathology implies an involvement in lesion progression.",M2
16647583,"Localization of neuregulin-1alpha (<e>heregulin</e>-alpha) and one of its receptors, ErbB-4 tyrosine kinase, in developing and adult human brain.Using immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and RT-polymerase chain reaction, we studied the distribution of neuregulin-1 splice variant alpha (NRG-1alpha) and one of its putative receptors, ErbB-4 tyrosine kinase, in human brain. In the pre- and perinatal human brain immunoreactivity was confined to numerous neurons, with the highest cell density found in cortical gray matter, hypothalamus and cerebellum. In the adult brain, single cortical gray and white matter neurons showed NRG-1alpha immunoreactivity. Occasionally, immunoreactive oligodendrocytes were observed. NRG-1alpha-expressing neurons were also found in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia and brain stem. Application of two antibodies recognizing alpha and beta isoforms revealed a different distribution pattern in that many cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons were labeled. ErbB-4 immunoreactivity was expressed in both neurons and oligodendrocytes. Our data show that NRG-1alpha expression is lower in the adult human brain than in the developing brain, and, therefore, support a role for NRG-1alpha in brain development.",M2
16489114,"Differentiation of human airway epithelia is dependent on erbB2.A clinical case documented a reversible change in airway epithelial differentiation that coincided with the initiation and discontinuation of trastuzumab, an anti-erbB2 antibody. This prompted the investigation into whether blocking the erbB2 receptor alters differentiation of the airway epithelium. To test this hypothesis, we treated an in vitro model of well-differentiated human airway epithelia with trastuzumab or <e>heregulin</e>-alpha, an erbB ligand. In addition, coculturing with human lung fibroblasts tested whether in vivo subepithelial fibroblasts function as an endogenous source of ligands able to activate erbB receptors expressed by the overlying epithelial cells. Epithelia were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and used for morphometric analysis. Trastuzumab treatment decreased the ciliated cell number by 49% and increased the metaplastic, flat cell number by 640%. Heregulin-alpha treatment increased epithelial height and decreased the number of metaplastic and nonciliated columnar cells, whereas it increased the goblet cell number. We found that normal human lung fibroblasts express transforming growth factor-alpha, heparin-binding epidermal-like growth factor, epiregulin, heregulin-alpha, and amphiregulin, all of which are erbB ligands. Cocultures of airway epithelia with primary fibroblasts increased epithelial height comparable to that achieved following heregulin-alpha treatment. These data show that erbB2 stimulation is required for maintaining epithelial differentiation. Furthermore, the mesenchyme underlying the airway epithelium secretes a variety of erbB ligands that may direct various pathways of epithelial differentiation.",M2
16482517,"Expression of <e>heregulin</e> by mouse mammary tumor cells: role in activation of ErbB receptors.The inappropriate activation of one or more members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases [ErbB-1 (EGFR), ErbB-2, ErbB-3, ErbB-4] has been linked with oncogenesis. ErbB-2 is frequently coexpressed with ErbB-3 in breast cancer cells and in the presence of the ligand heregulin (HRG) the ErbB-2/ErbB-3 receptors form a signaling heterodimer that can affect cell proliferation and apoptosis. The major goal of the present study was to determine whether endogenous HRG causes autocrine/paracrine activation of ErbB-2/ErbB-3 and contributes to the proliferation of mammary epithelial tumor cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated (activated) ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 receptors were detected in the majority of extracts from tumors that had formed spontaneously or as a result of oncogene expression. HRG-1 transcripts and protein were found in the epithelial cells of most of these mouse mammary tumors. Various mouse mammary cell lines also contained activated ErbB-2/ErbB-3 and HRG transcripts. A approximately 50 kDa C-terminal fragment of pro-HRG was detected, which indicates that the HRG-1 precursor is readily processed by these cells. It is likely that the secreted mature HRG activated the ErbB-2/3 receptors. Addition of an antiserum against HRG to the mammary epithelial tumor cell line TM-6 reduced ErbB-3 Tyr-phosphorylation. Treatment with HRG-1 siRNA oligonucleotides or infection with a retroviral construct to stably express HRG siRNA effectively reduced HRG protein levels, ErbB-2/ErbB-3 activation, and the rate of proliferation, which could be reversed by the addition of HRG. The cumulative findings from these experiments show that coexpression of the HRG ligand contributes to activation of ErbB-2/Erb-3 in mouse mammary tumor cells in an autocrine or paracrine fashion.",M2
16428439,"Essential role for Rac in <e>heregulin</e> beta1 mitogenic signaling: a mechanism that involves epidermal growth factor receptor and is independent of ErbB4.Heregulins are a family of ligands for the ErbB3/ErbB4 receptors that play important roles in breast cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Limited information is available on the contribution of Rho GTPases to heregulin-mediated signaling. In breast cancer cells, heregulin beta1 (HRG) causes a strong activation of Rac; however, it does so with striking differences in kinetics compared to epidermal growth factor, which signals through ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]). Using specific ErbB receptor inhibitors and depletion of receptors by RNA interference (RNAi), we established that, surprisingly, activation of Rac by HRG is mediated not only by ErbB3 and ErbB2 but also by transactivation of EGFR, and it is independent of ErbB4. Similar receptor requirements are observed for HRG-induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization and mitogenic activity via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). HRG-induced Rac activation was phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase dependent and Src independent. Furthermore, inactivation of Rac by expression of the Rac GTPase-activating protein beta2-chimerin inhibited HRG-induced ERK activation, mitogenicity, and migration in breast cancer cells. HRG mitogenic activity was also impaired by depletion of Rac1 using RNAi. Our studies established that Rac is a critical mediator of HRG mitogenic signaling in breast cancer cells and highlight additional levels of complexity for ErbB receptor coupling to downstream effectors that control aberrant proliferation and transformation.",M2
16357062,"<e>Heregulin</e>-alpha and heregulin-beta expression is linked to a COX-2-PGE2 pathway in human gastric fibroblasts.We have previously shown heregulin (HRG)-alpha expression in human gastric fibroblasts and its stimulation of gastric epithelial cell growth. Although cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 has also been shown to stimulate growth factor production in these cells, the interaction between COX-2 and HRG remains unknown. Conditioned media (CM) from gastric fibroblasts incubated with PGE(2) or interleukin (IL)-1beta, a well known COX-2 inducer, were analyzed for their effect on erbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation in MKN28 gastric epithelial cells. HRG protein expression in fibroblast lysates and CM was also examined by western blot. HRG-alpha and HRG-beta mRNA expression in gastric fibroblasts and human gastric tissue was examined by real-time quantitative PCR. HRG and COX-2 expressions in surgical resections of human gastric ulcer tissue were examined immunohistochemically. CM from fibroblasts incubated with PGE(2), or IL-1beta, stimulated erbB3 phosphorylation in MKN28 cells. Preincubation of the fibroblasts with celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, suppressed CM-induced erbB3 phosphorylation. This inhibition was reversed by exogenous PGE(2). As with erbB3 phophorylation, IL-1beta stimulated both HRG-alpha and HRG-beta mRNA expression, as well as HRG release into gastric fibroblast CM. IL-1beta-stimulated HRG expression and release were also inhibited by celecoxib, and exogenous PGE(2) restored this inhibitory effect, suggesting the activation of an IL-1beta-COX-2-PGE(2) pathway that culminates in the release of HRG from fibroblasts. HRG-alpha and HRG-beta mRNA levels were significantly higher in gastric ulcer tissue than in normal gastric mucosa. HRG immunoreactivity was found in interstitial cells of the gastric ulcer bed and coexpressed with COX-2. These results suggest that HRG might be a new member of the growth factor family involved in the COX-2-dependent ulcer repair process.",M2
16183643,"<e>Heregulin</e> induces glial cell line-derived neurotrophic growth factor-independent, non-branching growth and differentiation of ureteric bud epithelia.We have purified a protein present in a conditioned medium derived from the metanephric mesenchyme that supports non-branching growth and epithelial differentiation of the isolated ureteric bud (UB) independent of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic growth factor (GDNF). By sequential liquid chromatography, together with protein microsequencing, the protein was identified as heregulin (HRG)alpha. The addition of recombinant HRG to the isolated UB grown in three-dimensional culture confirmed the proliferative activity of HRG. In branching UBs induced by whole metanephric mesenchyme cell-conditioned medium, proliferating cells were localized at ampullae, where a binding receptor for GDNF, GFRalpha1, was found. In HRG-induced UBs, however, the expression of GFRalpha1 was down-regulated, and proliferating cells were distributed throughout the structure. Electron microscopic examination of the HRG-induced UB revealed the presence of structurally mature and polarized epithelial cells reminiscent of the epithelial cells found in the stalk portion of the branching UB. cDNA array analysis further revealed that genes ontologically classified as developmental were down-regulated by HRG, whereas those involved in transport were up-regulated. For example, the mRNA for the GDNF receptors, GFRalpha1 and ret9, was down-regulated, whereas the mRNA for collecting duct transporters, such as urea transporter2, aquaporin3, and sodium-hydrogen exchanger2 was up-regulated in HRG-treated UBs compared with UBs grown in the presence of branch-promoting factors. Moreover, HRG promoted growth of UBs cultured in the absence of GDNF. Taken together, the data suggest that HRG supports UB epithelial cell differentiation and non-GDNF-dependent growth, raising the possibility that this kind of activity plays a role in the growth and differentiation of the stalk portion of the branching epithelial UB.",M2
16170367,"The ErbB-4 s80 intracellular domain is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase.The ErbB-4 receptor tyrosine kinase homo- and heterodimerizes following <e>heregulin</e> binding, which provokes increased levels of tyrosine autophosphorylation. Unique to the ErbB family, ErbB-4 is then proteolytically cleaved by alpha- and gamma-secretase to produce an 80 kDa intracellular domain (s80 ICD) fragment. This fragment is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of many normal and cancer cells and can interact with transcription factors in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Since the s80 ICD lacks ectodomain sequences known to play a major role in dimerization of ErbB family members, we asked whether the s80 ICD is an active tyrosine kinase. Here, we demonstrate that the s80 ICD is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase and can form homodimers. The s80 ICD is autophosphorylated in cells and can phosphorylate an exogenous substrate in vitro. Also, the s80 ICD can coassociate and dimers are detected by chemical crosslinking. This is the first example of constitutive kinase activation and dimerization totally within the cytoplasmic domain of an ErbB receptor and suggests that the s80 ICD may function to phosphorylate substrates in the cytoplasm or nucleus.",M2
16158055,"MUC1 oncoprotein is targeted to mitochondria by <e>heregulin</e>-induced activation of c-Src and the molecular chaperone HSP90.The MUC1 heterodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed by most human carcinomas. The MUC1 C-terminal subunit localizes to mitochondria and blocks stress-induced activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. How MUC1 is delivered to mitochondria is not known. The present studies demonstrate that MUC1 forms intracellular complexes with HSP70 and HSP90. We show that the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain binds directly to HSP70 in vitro. By contrast, binding of MUC1 to HSP90 in vitro is induced by c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain. c-Src also increases binding of MUC1 to HSP90 in cells. In concert with these results, we show that heregulin (HRG), a ligand for ErbB receptors, activates c-Src and, in turn, stimulates binding of MUC1 to HSP90. We also show that inhibitors of c-Src or HSP90 block HRG-induced targeting of MUC1 to mitochondria and integration of MUC1 into the mitochondrial outer membrane. These findings indicate that MUC1 is delivered to mitochondria by a mechanism involving activation of the ErbB receptor--&gt;c-Src pathway and transport by the molecular chaperone HSP70/HSP90 complex.",M2
16155362,"Expression of <e>heregulin</e> in human coronary atherosclerotic lesions.BACKGROUND: Endothelial cells, monocytes/macrophages, and vascular smooth muscle cells contribute to the establishment and progression of atherosclerotic lesions by expressing growth and inflammatory factors. The aim of the present study was to determine whether heregulin (HRG) is associated with human coronary artery disease. METHODS: Twenty-six fresh human coronary artery segments were collected at autopsy. Expression of cysteine-rich 61 (CYR61) and VEGF in response to HRG was studied in the human endothelial cell line EA.hy926, and expression of CYR61 and HRG was evaluated in activated macrophages isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors. RESULTS: We found that HRG was overexpressed at the protein and mRNA level in all lesions analyzed and gradually increased as the stages of the lesions progressed. Expression of HRG was observed in the intima primarily in macrophages. The same specimens were analyzed for the expression of CYR61, an angiogenetic factor regulated by HRG in breast cancer epithelial cells. CYR61 was expressed in both normal and atheromatic specimens, but its expression was significantly enhanced in macrophages of the intima. Activation of primary human macrophages results in increased expression of both HRG and CYR61. In addition, studies in endothelial cells where no endogenous HRG is present showed that HRG induces expression of CYR61 and secretion of VEGF. CONCLUSIONS: HRG may, therefore, play an important role in the development of coronary artery disease and the expansion of the atherosclerotic plaque and may locally regulate the expression of the angiogenetic factor CYR61.",M2
16153156,"Differential localization of ErbB receptor ensembles influences their signaling in hippocampal neurons.Our studies indicate that ErbB complexes participate in both survival and synaptic plasticity signals of hippocampal neurons but in a manner that depends on the subcellular localization of the receptor ensembles. Using dissociated hippocampal cultures, we found that neurons, rather than glial cells, are the primary targets of ErbB receptor ligands such as epidermal growth factor and <e>heregulin</e>. Further investigation demonstrated that ErbB receptors distribute differentially in hippocampal neurons with the epidermal growth factor receptor confined to neural cell bodies and the p185(c-neu) and ErbB4 receptors distributed to both neural soma and neurites. Activation of ErbB receptor and downstream signaling molecules were observed in neurites only after heregulin stimulation. The receptor complex which mediated neurite located signals was the p185(c-neu)/ErbB4 heterodimer. Colocalization of p185(c-neu), but not epidermal growth factor receptor, with postsynaptic density protein 95 suggests that the heregulin signaling contributes to synapse specific activities. However, the epidermal growth factor receptor complex mediates physiological survival signals, as neuronal survival was enhanced by epidermal growth factor, rather than heregulin. Collectively, these studies indicate that different ErbB ensembles localize to different locations on the neuron to mediate distinct signals and functions.",M2
16007186,"Induction of heat shock proteins by <e>heregulin</e> beta1 leads to protection from apoptosis and anchorage-independent growth.Elevation of heat shock protein (HSP) levels is widespread in cancer and predicts a poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. We show that HSP elevation in tumor cells can be induced by the highly malignant factor heregulin beta1 (HRGbeta1), which induces HSP expression through heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). Inactivation of the hsf1 gene prevents HSP induction by HRGbeta1. HSP expression is induced through a cascade response initiated by HRGbeta1 binding to c-erbB receptors on the cell surface and which leads to the inhibition of intracellular HSF1 antagonist glycogen synthase kinase 3. HSF1 activated by this pathway plays a key role in the protection of cells from apoptosis and the mediation of anchorage independent growth by HRGbeta1, indicating a role for HSF1 in this tumorigenic pathway.",M2
15985438,"Secretase-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Mdm2 by the ErbB-4 intracellular domain fragment.<e>Heregulin</e> activation of the endogenous receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB-4 in ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells provokes tyrosine phosphorylation of Hdm2 in a manner that is sensitive to inhibition of alpha- or gamma-secretase activity, indicating that liberation of the tyrosine kinase intracellular domain (ICD) fragment is required. Similar results are obtained when Erbb-4 is exogenously expressed in 32D cells, which do not otherwise express any ErbB family members. Expression of the ErbB-4 ICD fragment leads to its constitutive association with Mdm2 and tyrosine phosphorylation of Mdm2, a protein that is predominantly localized in the nucleus and that regulates p53 levels. When the ErbB-4 ICD fragment was expressed in H1299 cells, it promoted Hdm2 ubiquitination and increased the levels of p53 and p21, a transcriptional target of p53. In addition, expression of the ICD fragment increased p53 activity toward the p21 promoter in a luciferase reporter assay.",M2
15862947,"Selective hormone-dependent repression of estrogen receptor beta by a p38-activated ErbB2/ErbB3 pathway.Deregulated signaling of ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is often associated with hormone resistance in estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive breast cancers, establishing a relationship between ErbB2 and ERalpha pathways. Although ERalpha and ERbeta are expressed in many breast cancer cells, the response of ERbeta to ErbB2 signaling is less well defined. In the present study, we demonstrate that ERbeta activity can be modulated by ErbB2 signaling in ER-expressing breast cancer cells. The estrogen-dependent transcriptional activity of ERbeta was altered in a manner similar to ERalpha by either activation of ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling by growth factor <e>heregulin</e> beta or expression of a constitutively active mutant of ErbB2. However, as opposed to ERalpha, the p38 MAPK pathway was found to be involved in liganded ERbeta repression activity by ErbB2 signaling and in regulating estrogen-responsive promoter occupancy by ERbeta. The repression in ERbeta response to hormone was dependent upon its AF-1 domain which includes serines 106 and 124, two phosphorylation target sites for Erk that we previously showed to be involved in SRC-1 recruitment to ERbeta. Substitution of these two serines by aspartic acid residues abolished the repression of ERbeta by activated ErbB2/ErbB3. Moreover, expression of SRC-1 also relieved the inhibition of ERbeta in heregulin-treated cells. Our study demonstrates a functional coupling between ERbeta and ErbB receptors and outlines the differential role of the AF-1 region in the regulation of the estrogen-dependent cell growth and activity of both estrogen receptors in response to growth factor signaling.",M2
15837734,"Growth factor regulation of a 26S proteasomal subunit in breast cancer.PURPOSE: We sought to gain insight into the mechanisms of <e>heregulin</e>-beta1 (HRG) action on breast epithelial cells by identifying and characterizing HRG-regulated proteins. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Differential display mRNA screening of human breast cancer cells grown in the presence or absence of HRG was used to identify HRG-regulated genes. Biochemical and functional studies were undertaken to examine the impact of HRG and the therapeutic antibody herceptin on protein expression, localization, and function. RESULTS: We identified the ATPase subunit 4 (S4) of the 26S proteasome as a HRG-regulated target. Both S4 mRNA and protein levels were increased by HRG; however, this HRG-stimulated increase was blocked by the therapeutic antibody herceptin. S4 expression was significantly increased in primary human breast tumors and in estrogen receptor-negative tumors. Coimmunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and ATPase activity assays suggested that HRG also induced S4 activity and formation of a functional proteasome complex. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of growth factor-regulated expression, localization, and activity of the S4 subunit of the 26S proteasome in human breast cancer cells. These findings now provide a potential mechanistic rationale for the use of proteasome inhibitors in breast cancers with active HRG signaling.",M2
15704104,"Anti-HER-3 MAbs inhibit HER-3-mediated signaling in breast cancer cell lines resistant to anti-HER-2 antibodies.Two members of the EGF receptor family, HER2 and HER3, act as key oncogenes in breast cancer cells. A MAb against HER2, trastuzumab, interferes with HER2 signaling and istherapeutically effective in humans. Here, we explored the biologic effects of an antibody against HER3 (alpha-HER3ECD) in the invasive breast cancer cell lines MCF-7ADR and MDA-MB-468. Pretreating the breast cancer cells with alpha-HER3ECD prior to <e>Heregulin</e> stimulation caused significant reduction of the migratory and proliferative properties. This reduction is due to a substantial decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation content of HER2 and to a modification of the HER2/HER3 association, which ultimately inhibits the activity of the downstream effectors phosphatidyinositol-3-OH-kinase and c-jun-terminal kinase. Furthermore, HER3 is internalized and not activated by HRG after pretreatment with alpha-HER3ECD. Our data reinforce the notion that HER3 could be a key target in cancer drug design and show the great potential of anti-HER3 antibodies for the therapy of breast cancer and other malignancies characterized by overexpression of HER3.",M2
15703820,"<e>Heregulin</e>-triggered Her-2/neu signaling enhances nuclear accumulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 and protects breast cancer cells from cisplatin-induced genotoxic damage.Elevated levels of p21WAF1/CIP1, an important mediator of DNA repair, have been observed in various aggressive tumors as well as linked to chemoresistance. We examined whether heregulin (HRG), a member of the EGF-like growth factor family closely related to breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis, modulates p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and cellular localization. We used a model system that consisted of MCF-7 cells and MCF-7 cells engineered to overexpress the full-length cDNA of the human HRG gene (MCF-7/HRG). MCF-7/HRG cells demonstrate constitutive hyperactivation of Her-2/neu receptor as well as activation of down-stream PI-3'K/AKT and MAPK signaling cascades. Immunoblotting analyses showed that MCF-7/HRG cells significantly up-regulate p21WAF1/CIP1 expression relative to control MCF-7/pBABE cells, while a strong nuclear accumulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 in MCF-7/HRG cells was revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy studies. Protein degradation analyses demonstrated that the half-life of p21WAF1/CIP1 protein was increased from approximately 35 min in control MCF-7/pBABE cells to &gt;/=3 h in MCF-7/HRG cells. Pharmacological inactivation of the PI-3'K/AKT and MAPK completely prevented HRG-induced accumulation of p21WAF1/CIP1. A structural deletion mutant of HRG (HRG-M4) lacking the N-terminus sequence and the cytoplasmic-transmembrane region of HRG was generated to investigate whether secretion of HRG and transactivation of Her-2/neu actively contributed to HRG-regulated p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and cellular localization. MCF-7 cells engineered to overexpress HRG-M4 did not demonstrate either activation of Her-2/neu, PI-3'K/AKT, or MAPK. Remarkably, HRG-M4 overexpression completely abolished the ability of HRG to promote nuclear accumulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 and concomitantly enhanced the apoptotic effects of cisplatin towards breast cancer cells. This novel interplay between HRG and p21WAF1/CIP1 strongly suggests that one mechanism of HRG-regulated breast cancer cell proliferation, survival, and/or sensitivity to genotoxic damage is to stabilize and promote a nuclear accumulation of p21WAF1/CIP1.",M2
15645137,"Prolactin and <e>heregulin</e> override DNA damage-induced growth arrest and promote phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent proliferation in breast cancer cells.Heregulin (HRG), a ligand of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases, is a potent mitogenic factor for breast cancer cells. Prolactin (PRL) has also been reported to regulate proliferation in breast cancer cells through its receptor, a member of the type I cytokine receptor family. Cytokine receptors are potent mitogens in hematopoietic cells, where they also override DNA damage-induced growth arrest checkpoints through activation of a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. In this study, we assessed the effect of gamma-irradiation on the mitogenic activity of HRG and PRL in breast cancer cells. HRG and PRL enhanced the proliferation of non-irradiated breast cancer cell lines in association with their ability to activate PI3K signaling pathways. Both growth factors also overrode irradiation-induced growth arrest in T47D cells, which resulted in decreased viability after irradiation. An inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, abrogated growth factor-induced proliferation and the activity of cell cycle-dependent kinases in non-irradiated and irradiated cells. Thus, growth factors acting through distinct receptor families share a similar PI3K-dependent ability to promote proliferation and override DNA damage-induced growth arrest in breast cancer cells. These observations also suggest that selective activation of PI3K-dependent signaling can enhance radiosensitivity in breast cancer cells.",M2
15782133,"AlphaVbeta3 integrin regulates <e>heregulin</e> (HRG)-induced cell proliferation and survival in breast cancer.alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-overexpression in tumor associated vasculature is a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer. A positive correlation between alpha(v)beta(3) integrin and overexpression of Heregulin (HRG), a growth factor associated with breast cancer aggressiveness was recently demonstrated. Here, we addressed the role of alpha(v)beta(3) in the proliferation and survival of HRG-overexpressing breast cancer models. Expression of the RGD-binding integrins alpha(v)beta(3), alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(6) was assessed in the HRG-overexpressing breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, Hs578T (231/WT and Hs578T/WT, respectively) and derived cells transfected with the antisense orientation of the HRG-beta2 full-length cDNA (231/ASPOOL, 231/AS31 and Hs578T/AS15). Interestingly, only alpha(v)beta(3) expression was noticeably decreased by blockade of HRG expression in the 231/ASPOOL, 231/AS31 and Hs578T/AS15 cells. Small RGD-based peptidomimetic alpha(v)beta(3) antagonists significantly decreased cell viability and anchorage-dependent cell growth of HRG-overexpressing cells, while the low-HRG-expressing 231/AS31 cells did not show a significant response. Mechanistically, functional blockade of alpha(v)beta(3) impaired HRG-promoted hyperactivation of ERK1/ERK2 MAPK without altering the activation of AKT. Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle demonstrated that alpha(v)beta(3) antagonists significantly decreased S- and G2/M-phase subpopulations of 231/WT and control 231/VEC cells. Comparable, this effect was linked to an increase in the levels and nuclear translocation of the CDKs inhibitor p27(Kip1). Besides downregulating alpha(v)beta(3) and its driven signaling, HRG blockade led to decreased levels of CYR61 in 231/ASPOOL and 231/AS31 cells. Considering that CYR61 is sufficient to upregulate the expression of alpha(v)beta(3), we then assessed alpha(v)beta(3) levels in MDA-MB-231 cell derivatives expressing the antisense orientation of the CYR61 cDNA (231/CYR61AS-5 and 231/CYR61AS-8). Remarkably, downregulation of CYR61 drastically decreased the levels of alpha(v)beta(3) in the 231/CYR61-5 and 231/CYR61-8 cells, providing further evidence of a key role for CYR61 in HRG-dependent alpha(v)beta(3) overexpression. Moreover, blockade of CYR61 expression impaired the HRG-induced hyperactivation of ERK1/ERK2 MAPK without altering the activation status of AKT in MDA-MB-231 cells, thus resembling the effects exerted by the downregulation of HRG expression as well as by functional blockade of alpha(v)beta(3). These results indicate that HRG is regulating alpha(v)beta(3) levels as well as alpha(v)beta(3)-triggered signaling through its downstream effector, CYR61, in highly invasive breast cancer cells. Altogether, the data presented here provide evidence of a CYR61-regulatory role on alpha(v)beta(3) integrin expression in the modulation of uncontrolled growth of HRG-overexpressing breast carcinomas. This work supports additional studies concerning the use of integrin antagonists as dual therapeutic agents in breast cancer, targeting both, endothelial and tumor cells.",M2
15713896,"H-RAS V12-induced radioresistance in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells is <e>heregulin</e> dependent.The abilities of mutated active K-RAS and H-RAS proteins, in an isogenic human carcinoma cell system, to modulate the activity of signaling pathways following exposure to ionizing radiation is unknown. Loss of K-RAS D13 expression in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells blunted basal extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), AKT, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1/2 activity. Deletion of the allele to express K-RAS D13 also enhanced expression of ERBB1, ERBB3, and heregulin but nearly abolished radiation-induced activation of all signaling pathways. Expression of H-RAS V12 in HCT116 cells lacking an activated RAS molecule (H-RAS V12 cells) restored basal ERK1/2 and AKT activity to that observed in parental cells but did not restore or alter basal c-jun NH2-terminal kinase 1/2 activity. In parental cells, radiation caused stronger ERK1/2 pathway activation compared with that of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, which correlated with constitutive translocation of Raf-1 into the plasma membrane of parental cells. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK1/2, but not PI3K, radiosensitized parental cells. In H-RAS V12 cells, radiation caused stronger PI3K/AKT pathway activation compared with that of the ERK1/2 pathway, which correlated with H-RAS V12-dependent translocation of PI3K into the plasma membrane. Inhibition of PI3K, but not mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK1/2, radiosensitized H-RAS V12 cells. Radiation-induced activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in H-RAS V12 cells 2 to 24 hours after exposure was dependent on heregulin-stimulated ERBB3 association with membrane-localized PI3K. Neutralization of heregulin function abolished radiation-induced AKT activation and reverted the radiosensitivity of H-RAS V12 cells to those levels found in cells lacking expression of any active RAS protein. These findings show that H-RAS V12 and K-RAS D13 differentially regulate radiation-induced signaling pathway function. In HCT116 cells expressing H-RAS V12, PI3K-dependent radioresistance is mediated by both H-RAS-dependent translocation of PI3K into the plasma membrane and heregulin-induced activation of membrane-localized PI3K via ERBB3.",M2
15623844,"beta-Carotene downregulates the steady-state and <e>heregulin</e>-alpha-induced COX-2 pathways in colon cancer cells.Experimental studies have shown that beta-carotene inhibited the growth of colon cancer cells, and human trials have demonstrated that the carotenoid reduces colon cell proliferation of adenomatous polyps; however, molecular mechanisms underlying this chemopreventive activity remain unclear. Because COX-2 has been implicated as a causative factor in colon carcinogenesis, the present study was designed to investigate the relation between the growth-inhibitory effect of the carotenoid and COX-2 expression in colon cancer cells. We evaluated the effects of beta-carotene on the growth of human colon adenocarcinoma cells overexpressing (LS-174, HT-29, WiDr) or not expressing (HCT116) COX-2. We also studied COX-2 expression induced by heregulin-alpha, apoptosis induction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation. beta-Carotene (0.5-2.0 micromol/L) decreased COX-2 expression (P &lt; 0.05) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production (P &lt; 0.05) in colon cancer cells. This effect was not observed in cells treated with retinoic acid or retinol. The downregulation of COX-2 by the carotenoid occurred in both untreated and heregulin-treated cells. It was accompanied by an increased ability of cells to undergo apoptosis and by a decrease in intracellular ROS production and in the activation of ERK1/2. Moreover, cells not expressing COX-2 were insensitive to the growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of the carotenoid. Here, we report that the suppression of COX-2 by beta-carotene may represent a molecular mechanism by which this compound acts as an antitumor agent in colon carcinogenesis.",M2
15611073,"Oligomers of ERBB3 have two distinct interfaces that differ in their sensitivity to disruption by <e>heregulin</e>.ErbB receptors associate in a ligand-dependent or -independent manner, and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB1) or ErbB2 results in ligand-independent activation. Ligand-independent activation is poorly understood, and dimerization alone is not sufficient for activation. ErbB receptors also form higher order oligomers, but the mechanism of oligomer formation and their contribution to signaling are not known. The kinase-deficient ErbB3 as well as its extracellular domains are particularly prone to ligand-independent oligomerization, and oligomers are destabilized by binding of the ligand heregulin. In contrast, ligand binding facilitates heterodimerization with ErbB2 and is expected to stabilize an extended conformation of the ErbB3 extracellular domain (ECD) in which the dimerization interface is exposed. In the absence of ligand, ErbB3 can adopt a closed conformation that is held together by an intramolecular tether. We used a constitutively extended form of the ErbB3-ECD to analyze the conformation of the ECD in oligomers and the mechanism of oligomer disruption by heregulin. The extended conformation of the ECD forms oligomers more readily, suggesting the crystallographically defined dimer interface is one of the interfaces involved in oligomerization. Heregulin destabilizes oligomeric complexes but not dimers, which are neither stabilized nor disrupted by ligand binding, indicating a distinct second interface in oligomers of ErbB3. Cross-linking and activation studies on membrane-embedded ErbB3/ErbB2 chimeras confirm this dual effect of heregulin. Most of the ErbB3-ECD on the cell surface is apparently kept in an open conformation through oligomerization, and the resulting oligomers adopt a conformation representing a state of reduced activity.",M2
15609326,"Bowes melanoma cells secrete <e>heregulin</e>, which can promote aggregation and counteract invasion of human mammary cancer cells.Invasiveness, the ability of cancer cells to migrate beyond the normal tissue boundaries, often leads to metastasis and thereby usually turns cancer into a fatal disease. At the molecular level, the E-cadherin/catenin complex is an example of a powerful invasion suppressor in epithelial cells. Since the absence of melanocytes has been associated with disturbances in epithelial organization, we decided to investigate the influence of molecules secreted by melanocytes on the function of the E-cadherin/catenin complex. We used the Bowes melanoma cell line as a source of such molecules. The conditioned medium of Bowes melanoma stimulated aggregation of human MCF-7/6 mammary adenocarcinoma cells at short (30 min) and long (24-72 hr) notice. This effect could be inhibited by MB2, an antibody against human E-cadherin. Conditioned medium of Bowes melanoma also inhibited invasion of MCF-7/6 cells into precultured chick heart fragments. Candidate molecules such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, follistatin and interleukins were ruled out to be responsible for the effects, but heregulin mimicked some of the effects of the conditioned medium. Our data indicate that heregulin stimulates aggregation and inhibits invasion of MCF-7/6 cells via activation of the E-cadherin/catenin complex.",M2
15586221,"Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway prevents radiation-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells.Radiotherapy is widely used in the treatment of breast cancer and reduces the risk of loco-regional recurrence. Overexpression of the erbB2 receptor occurs in 20-30% of all breast cancers, and seems to be involved in chemotherapeutic resistance of breast cancer cells and radioresistance of lung cancer cells. The hypothesis of this study was that erbB2 confers resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt signalling pathway. Two human breast cancer cell lines were used, BT-474 and MCF-7. BT-474 cells overexpress erbB2 and have mutated p53, while MCF-7 have normal expression of erbB2 and functional p53. The cells were treated with the PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin or the erbB receptor ligand <e>heregulin</e>-beta1, which is expressed by both malignant and stromal cells in vivo. After pharmacological treatment, the cells were irradiated with 10 Gy gamma-radiation. Consistent with the p53 status in the cell lines, gamma-radiation caused G1 arrest in MCF-7 cells, but not in BT-474 cells. 10 Gy gamma-radiation increased apoptosis by on an average 76% (95% CI, 44-109%) in MCF-7. Treatment of MCF-7 with heregulin-beta1 decreased apoptosis by 66% (95% CI, 48-84%) compared to the untreated controls. In BT-474 cells, wortmannin in combination with radiation resulted in 119% (95% CI, 76-161%) more apoptosis compared to wortmannin alone, whereas radiation alone resulted in 45% (95% CI, 15-75%) increased apoptosis. This radiosensitising effect was not seen in MCF-7. Furthermore, transfection of MCF-7 cells with constitutively active Akt made the cells more resistant against apoptosis. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that the erbB2/PI3-K/Akt signalling pathway is involved in resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells in which this signalling pathway is overstimulated.",M2
15767552,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-related protein inhibits multiple members of the EGFR family in colon and breast cancer cells.Inactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members represents a promising strategy for the development of selective therapies against epithelial cancers. Current anti-EGFR therapies, such as cetuximab (Erbitux), gefitinib (Iressa), or trastuzumab (Herceptin), target EGFR or HER-2 but not both. Because solid tumors express different EGFRs, identification of inhibitor(s), targeting multiple EGFR family members may provide a therapeutic benefit to a broader patient population. We have identified a natural inhibitor of EGFRs called EGFR-related protein (ERRP), a 53 to 55 kDa protein that is present in most, if not all, normal human epithelial cells. The growth of colon (HCT-116, Caco2, and HT-29) and breast (MDA-MB-468 and SKBR-3) cancer cells expressing varying levels of EGFR, HER-2, and/or HER-4 was inhibited by recombinant ERRP in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, ERRP caused no inhibition of growth of normal mouse fibroblast cell lines (NIH-3T3, NIH-3T3/P67), and the growth of nontransformed rat small intestinal IEC-6 cells expressing relatively low levels of EGFRs was inhibited only at high doses of ERRP. Transforming growth factor-alpha or heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-induced activation of EGFR and HER-2 was inhibited by ERRP in colon and breast cancer cells expressing high levels of EGFR or HER-2. In contrast, cetuximab inhibited the growth- and ligand-induced activation of EGFR in cell lines expressing high levels of EGFR, whereas trastuzumab was effective only in HER-2-overexpressing cells. ERRP and trastuzumab, but not cetuximab, attenuated <e>heregulin</e>-alpha-induced activation of colon and breast cancer cells that expressed high levels of HER-2. Furthermore, ERRP, but not cetuximab or trastuzumab, significantly induced apoptosis of colon and breast cancer cells. None of these agents induced apoptosis of either NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblast or normal rat small intestinal IEC cells. Our results suggest that ERRP is an effective pan-erbB inhibitor and, thus, may be a potential therapeutic agent for a wide variety of epithelial cancers expressing different levels and subclasses of EGFRs.",M2

In prostate tumors that recur after androgen withdrawal, the AR is highly expressed and transcriptionally active in the absence of testicular androgens. In these  androgen-independent  tumors, alternative means of AR activation have been invoked, including regulation by growth factors and their receptors in prostate cancer recurrence. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS: In this report, we show that HER receptor tyrosine kinases 1 through 4 are expressed in the CWR-R1 recurrent prostate cancer cell line; their stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and heregulin activates downstream signaling, including mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and Akt pathways. We show that heregulin activates HER2 and HER3 and increases androgen-dependent AR transactivation of reporter genes in CWR-R1 cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3, AR transactivation, and cell proliferation induced by heregulin were more potently inhibited by the EGFR/HER2 dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor GW572016 (lapatinib) than the EGFR-specific inhibitor ZD1839 (gefitinib). Basal proliferation in the absence of growth factors was also inhibited by GW572016 to a greater extent than ZD1839, suggesting that low level HER2/HER3 activation perhaps by an autocrine pathway contributes to the proliferation signal. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that heregulin signaling through HER2 and HER3 increases AR transactivation and alters growth in a recurrent prostate cancer cell line. Therefore, inhibition of low-level HER2 signaling may be a potential novel therapeutic strategy in prostate cancer.",M2
15748904,"Epidermal growth factor receptor coexpression modulates susceptibility to Herceptin in HER2/neu overexpressing breast cancer cells via specific erbB-receptor interaction and activation.BACKGROUND: Growth factors and Herceptin specifically and differentially modulate cell proliferation of tumor cells. However, the mechanism of action on erbB-receptor level is incompletely understood. We evaluated Herceptin's capacity to modulate erbB-receptor activation and interaction on the cell surface level and thereby potentially impair cell proliferation of HER2/neu (c-erbB2) overexpressing breast cancer cells, both in the presence and absence of relevant growth factors. METHODS: BT474 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines were treated with Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), <e>Heregulin</e>, and with Herceptin in different combinations. Kinetics of cell proliferation were evaluated flow cytometrically based on BrdU-labeling. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, ELISAs and phosphorylation site specific Western Blotting was performed to investigate erbB-receptor interaction and activation. RESULTS: EGF induced EGFR/EGFR and EGFR/c-erbB2 interactions correlate with stimulation of cell proliferation in BT474 cells. Both homo- and heterodimerization are considerably less pronounced in SK-BR-3 cells and heterointeraction is additionally reduced by EGF treatment, causing inhibition of cell proliferation. Heregulin stimulates cell proliferation extensively in both cell lines. Herceptin drives BT474 cells more efficiently into quiescence than it does with SK-BR-3 cells and thereby blocks cell cycle progress. In SK-BR-3 Herceptin treatment causes c-erbB2 phosphorylation of Y877 and Y1248, EGF induces Y877 and Y1112 phosphorylation. The Y1112 phosphorylation site, activated by EGF in SK-BR-3 cell, is bypassed in BT474. In addition the inhibitory capacity of Herceptin on BT474 and SK-BR-3 cell proliferation depends on the presence and absence of growth factors to a various extent. CONCLUSION: The growth inhibitory effect of Herceptin on c-erbB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells is considerably modulated by EGFR coexpression and consequently EGFR/c-erbB2 homo- and heterointeractions, as well as the presence or absence of growth factors. C-erbB2 overexpression alone is insufficient to predict the impact of growth factors and antibodies on cell proliferation. The optimization and specification of therapeutic approaches based on erbB-receptor targeting requires to account for EGFR coexpression as well as the potential presence of erbB-receptor relevant growth factors.",M2
15583696,"Expression of HER3, HER4 and their ligand <e>heregulin</e>-4 is associated with better survival in bladder cancer patients.The epidermal growth factor system has been associated to prognosis in patients with bladder cancer based mainly on the expression of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor 1 (EGFR) and HER2 and their activating ligands. Since limited information exists concerning the expression of other parts of the EGF system, we examined the expression of the receptors HER3 and HER4 and their activating ligands, the heregulins (HRGs), in bladder cancer patients. Biopsies from bladder cancer tumours were obtained from 88 patients followed for a median of 23 months (range, 1-97 months). The mRNA content of four ligands and their isoforms (HRG1alpha, HRG1beta, HRG2alpha, HRG2beta, HRG3 and HRG4) and two receptors (HER3 and HER4) was quantified by real-time PCR. A significantly lower mRNA expression level of HER3 (P=0.0003), HRG2alpha (P=0.0159), HRG2beta (P=0.0007) and HRG4 (P&lt;0.0001) was observed in muscle-invasive (T2-T4) tumours as compared to superficial (Ta) tumours. The expression of HER3 mRNA correlated strongly to overall survival (P=0.0042); increased expression of HER4 (P=0.0261) and HRG4 (P=0.0245) was also associated with better prognosis. Interestingly, patients with coexpression of HER3 (P=0.0034) or HER4 (P=0.0080) together with their stimulating ligand HRG4 showed even better survival than for HER3 or HER4 alone. Our results together with previous data suggest a dual face for the EGF system. While it is well established that an increased signalling through HER1 and HER2 is related to a poor prognosis, our data suggest that signalling through HER3 and HER4 is related to a favourable outcome in bladder cancer patients.",M2
