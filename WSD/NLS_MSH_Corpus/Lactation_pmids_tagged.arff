20496862,"Effect of late gestation low protein supply to mink (Mustela vison) dams on reproductive performance and metabolism of dam and offspring.Protein malnutrition in utero that induces permanent changes in metabolism has been investigated intensively in various animals in recent years, but to the best of our knowledge, not yet in the mink, a strict carnivore. In the present study, minks were fed either a low-protein (LP) diet, i.e., with a protein:fat:carbohydrate ratio of 14:51:35% of metabolisable energy (ME), or an adequate-protein diet (AP), i.e. 29:56:15% of ME, from when implantation was completed until parturition (17.9 +/- 3.6 days). Respiration and balance experiments were performed during both gestation and <e>lactation</e>. Plasma concentrations of leptin, IGF-1, and insulin were determined by radioimmunoassay; the relative abundances of glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-P2ase), phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate kinase (PKM2) were determined in liver, and abundances of adiponectin and leptin in adipose tissue were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (q PCR). The protein supply only affected quantitative metabolism traits during the period of differentiated feeding. The dietary composition was reflected in the nitrogen metabolism and substrate oxidation, but no effects remained during lactation. The LP dams tended to have a smaller liver mass in relation to body weight than did AP dams (2.5% vs. 2.9%; p = 0.09), significantly less leptin mRNA (p &lt; 0.05), and 30.6% fewer kits per mated female (p = 0.03). Furthermore, F1-generation kits exposed to protein restriction during foetal life (FLP1; 10.3 g) had a lower birth weight (p = 0.004) than did F1-generation kits exposed to adequate protein (FAP1; 11.3 g). Differences remained significant until 21 days of age (120.4 g vs. 127.6 g; p = 0.005). The FLP1 foetuses displayed a lower abundance of Fru-1,6-P2ase mRNA (p = 0.007) and of PKM2 mRNA (p = 0.002) than did FAP1 foetuses. Whether these changes during foetal life cause permanent changes in the glucose homeostasis of the offspring and result in the transmission of epigenetic phenotypic changes, as seen in the rat, needs further investigation.",M1
20460516,"Transforming growth factor-beta regulator SnoN modulates mammary gland branching morphogenesis, postlactational involution, and mammary tumorigenesis.SnoN is an important negative regulator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling that was originally identified as a transforming oncogene in chicken embryonic fibroblasts. Both pro-oncogenic and antioncogenic activities of SnoN have been reported, but its function in normal epithelial cells has not been defined. In the mouse mammary gland, SnoN is expressed at relatively low levels, but it is transiently upregulated at late gestation before being downregulated during <e>lactation</e> and early involution. To assess the effects of elevated levels of SnoN, we generated transgenic mice expressing a SnoN fragment under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. In this model system, SnoN elevation increased side-branching and lobular-alveolar proliferation in virgin glands, while accelerating involution in postlactation glands. Increased proliferation stimulated by SnoN was insufficient to induce mammary tumorigenesis. In contrast, elevated levels of SnoN cooperated with polyoma middle T antigen to accelerate the formation of aggressive multifocal adenocarcinomas and to increase the formation of pulmonary metastases. Our studies define functions of SnoN in mammary epithelial cell proliferation and involution, and provide the first in vivo evidence of a pro-oncogenic role for SnoN in mammalian tumorigenesis.",M1
20453077,"Neonatal nicotine exposure causes insulin and leptin resistance and inhibits hypothalamic leptin signaling in adult rat offspring.Maternal nicotine (NIC) exposure during <e>lactation</e> leads to overweight, hyperleptinemia, and hypothyroidism in adult rat offspring. In this model, we analyzed adipocyte morphology, glucose homeostasis (serum insulin and adiponectin; liver and muscle glycogen), serum lipid, and the leptin signaling pathway. After birth, osmotic minipumps were implanted in lactating rats, which were divided into the groups NIC (6 mg/kg per day s.c. for 14 days) and control (C, saline). NIC and C offspring were killed at the age of 180 days. Adult NIC rats showed higher total body fat (+10%, P&lt;0.05), visceral fat mass (+12%, P&lt;0.05), and cross-sectional area of adipocytes (epididymal: +12% and inguinal: +43%, P&lt;0.05). Serum lipid profile showed no alteration except for apolipoprotein AI, which was lower. We detected a lower adiponectin:fat mass ratio (-24%, P&lt;0.05) and higher insulinemia (+56%, P&lt;0.05), insulin resistance index (+43%, P&lt;0.05), leptinemia (+113%, P&lt;0.05), and leptin:adiponectin ratio (+98%, P&lt;0.05) in the adult NIC group. These rats presented lower hypothalamic contents of the proteins of the leptin signaling pathway (leptin receptor (OB-R): -61%, janus tyrosine kinase 2: -41%, and p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3: -56%, P&lt;0.05), but higher suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (+81%, P&lt;0.05). Therefore, NIC exposure only during lactation programs rats for adipocyte hypertrophy in adult life, as well as for leptin and insulin resistance. Through the effects of NIC, perinatal maternal cigarette smoking may be responsible for the future development of some components of the metabolic syndrome in the offspring.",M1
20449534,"Exposure to flaxseed during <e>lactation</e> does not alter prostate area or epithelium height but changes lipid profile in rats.Flaxseed intake has increased owing to beneficial effects to health and prevention of diseases. Provided that it's an important source of lignan, a phytoestrogen, the present study aimed at evaluating the possible effect of the intake of this seed during lactation upon prostate, sexual hormones and lipidic profile of the offspring in adult life. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 16 female Wistar rats were used. After delivery, they were divided into two different groups to receive one of the following diets during lactation: Control group (CG), with a casein based diet and Flaxseed group (FG), with a flaxseed based diet containing 25% flaxseed. At weaning, male pups received commercial chow until adult life (170 days old), when they were sacrificed. RESULTS: No differences were perceived concerning offspring food intake and body weight at 170 days. There was a reduction in total cholesterol levels (FG = 45.71 +/- 8.96 mg/dL; CG = 63.43 +/- 15.69 mg/dL, p = 0.02) and triglycerides (FG = 54.29 +/- 11.10 mg/dL; CG = 79.86 +/- 25.68 mg/dL, p = 0.03). Also, no alterations were observed in prostatic morphology, testosterone or estradiol levels in the two groups analyzed. CONCLUSION: Flaxseed intake during lactation did not produce histological alterations in prostatic alveolus or in sexual hormones, but programmed to a reduction in lipid profile in adult life with decreased cardiovascular risk.",M1
20445278,"[Secondary osteoporosis UPDATE. Bone metabolic change and osteoporosis during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e>]Calcium transfer from the mother to the infant during pregnancy and lactation plays an extremely important role in the bone health of the mother and neonate. Calcium aids in bone health through all ages but is especially crucial during pregnancy and lactation. Changes in the structure and metabolism of bone during pregnancy and the early stage of postpartum are evaluated by investigating bone mineral density (BMD), bone histomorphometry and bone markers of human or animal models. The bone resorption increased at the end of pregnancy and lactation, and the bone formation increases and the bone structure is almost recovered after cessation of lactating in postpartum. Puerperal BMD remained static over the subsequent 5-10 years. If the women have a low BMD at this stage of their reproductive life, it tends not to improve over this time. Perhaps identification of this at-risk group may lead to effective interventions to reduce fracture risk in later life.",M1
20438505,"Effects of misty-fan cooling and supplemental rbST on rumen function and milk production of crossbred Holstein cattle during early, mid and late <e>lactation</e> in a tropical environment.Two groups of five crossbred 87.5% Holstein cattle were housed in normal shade only (NS) as non-cooled cows and in shaded housing with misty-fan cooling (MF) as cooled cows. The cows were treated with recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) in early, mid and late lactation with three consecutive injections of rbST in every 14 days. Ambient temperatures and the temperature humidity index in the NS barn were significantly higher than those of the MF barn, whereas relative humidity in MF was higher than that of NS barn. The DMI of cooled cows were higher than those of non-cooled cows, and cooled cows exhibited more response to rbST treatment. Exogenous rbST significantly increased milk yield throughout lactation. The rbST-treated cows had higher total ruminal fermentation products as volatile fatty acid and ammonia nitrogen than the non-rbST treated cows and associated changes were greater in cooled animals in all stages of lactation. Exogenous rbST increased the concentrations of milk urea nitrogen in both groups. These results suggest that the changes in ruminal fermentation with greater production of total VFA and NH(3)N in response to rbST in crossbred cows whether under misty-fan cooling or not, is in part through an increase in feed intake, thereby making more substrate available to the mammary gland for milk synthesis.",M1
20437475,"Peri- and postnatal rodent development of Hematide, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent.BACKGROUND: Aperi- and postnatal reproduction toxicity study was conducted in rats treated with Hematide, a synthetic PEGylated peptidic erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA). METHODS: Hematide, at IV doses of 0, 0.5, 3, and 15 mg/kg, was administered from implantation through <e>lactation</e> on gestation days (GDs) 5 and 18 and lactation day (LD) 13. RESULTS: Hematide induced pronounced polycythemia in all Hematide-treated dams. On LDs 2 and 21, hemoglobin (Hgb) increases above control levels were 3.1, 5.2, and 5.0 g/dL and 4.1, 5.1, and 5.5 g/dL at the 0.5, 3, and 15 mg/kg/dose, respectively. There were no effects on parturition, lactation, or maternal behavior in the F0 generation female rats. A slight decrease in pup viability on postpartum days 2-4 and lower body weights and/or body weight gain for the F1 generation were associated with pronounced polycythemia and decreases in maternal body weight gain and/or food consumption at &gt; or =3 mg/kg/dose. Hematide fetal exposure was negligible. No Hematide effect, other than on growth and survival, was noted on developmental, functional, mating, and fertility end points in the F1 generation rats, and no effect on litter or fetal parameters was observed in the F2 generation. The maternal no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for Hematide was 0.5 mg/kg, and the NOAEL for parturition and maternal behavior was 15 mg/kg. The NOAEL for F1 pup viability and growth was 0.5 mg/kg/dose. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the Hematide-associated adverse findings were attributed to exaggerated erythropoiesis (pronounced and prolonged polycythemia) resulting from administration of an ESA to pregnant animals.",M1
20432709,"[Physical state of mother at the period of pregnancy and sexual maturation of descendants-sons of the water vole (Arvicola terrestris L.)]The role of characteristics of the maternal medium (the mother's physical state at periods of pregnancy and <e>lactation</e>, calendar terms of birth, the number of pups, and the ratio of sexes in the litter) has been elucidated in regulation of growth and the sexual maturation of the water vole male pups. The anogenital distance was used as an indirect supravital evaluation of the mass of testicles. The physical state of females was estimated by a change of the body mass at the period of pregnancy or lactation with aid of parameters characterizing deviation of the female body mass after the end of each reproductive cycle stage from the calculated value found from the empirical regression equation. Sons of the females whose body mass increment for the period of pregnancy exceeded the expected value or was equal to it were growing faster. Results of regression analysis have shown that the the anogenital distance in the 19-week old males is dependent statistically significantly only on the physical state of the mother at the period of their embryonic development.",M1
20413720,"ABCG5/ABCG8-independent biliary cholesterol excretion in lactating rats.<e>Lactation</e> is associated with increased expression of bile acid transporters and an increased size and hydrophobicity of the bile acid pool in rats. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters multidrug resistance protein 2 (Mdr2), Abcb11 [bile salt export pump (Bsep)], and Abcg5/Abcg8 heterodimers are essential for the biliary secretion of phospholipids, bile acids, and cholesterol, respectively. We investigated the expression of these transporters and secretion of their substrates in female control and lactating Sprague Dawley rats and C57BL/6 mice. Expression of Abcg5/Abcg8 mRNA was decreased by 97 and 60% by midlactation in rats and mice, respectively; protein levels of Abcg8 were below detection limits in lactating rats. Mdr2 mRNA expression was decreased in lactating rats and mice by 47 and 59%, respectively. Despite these changes in transporter expression, basal concentrations of cholesterol and phospholipid in bile were unchanged in rats and mice, whereas increased Bsep mRNA expression in early lactation coincided with an increased basal biliary bile acid concentration in lactating mice. Following taurocholate infusion, coupling of phospholipid and taurocholate secretion in bile of lactating mice was significantly impaired relative to control mice, with no significant changes in maximal secretion of cholesterol or bile acids. In rats, taurocholate infusion revealed a significantly impaired coupling of cholesterol to taurocholate secretion in bile in lactating vs. control animals. These data reveal marked utilization of an Abcg5/Abcg8-independent mechanism for basal biliary cholesterol secretion in rats during lactation, but a dependence on Abcg5/g8 for maximal biliary cholesterol secretion.",M1
20402701,"Effects of increasing days of exposure to prepartum diets on the concentration of certain blood metabolites in dairy cows.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the number of days exposure to a prepartum transition diet on mineral, energy and protein metabolism in dairy cows. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. PROCEDURES: The prepartum transition diet consisted of ryegrass pasture, cereal hay, grain, grain by-product, protein meals, BioChlor, rumen modifiers, minerals and vitamins and contained 13.9% crude protein, 10.0 MJ metabolisable energy/kg and a dietary cation anion difference of -35 meq/kg dry matter. Forty cows were bled bi-weekly from their introduction to the prepartum transition diet until day 35 of <e>lactation</e>. Blood samples were submitted for estimation of a range of metabolites. Cubic smoothed splines were fitted to scatterplots of metabolite concentration as a function of day relative to calving and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Linear regression modelling determined the effect of days exposed, age, body condition score (BSC) and calving day on AUC. Results The prepartum AUC of blood phosphorus and beta-hydroxybutyrate increased and the AUC of blood calcium and cholesterol decreased with increasing days exposed to the diet. The postpartum AUC of beta-hydroxybutyrate and non-esterified fatty acids decreased with increasing days exposed but increased with days exposed x age and days exposed x BCS, respectively. The AUC of other metabolites did not vary significantly with number of days exposed. Conclusions Increasing exposure to the prepartum diet significantly altered the AUC of blood metabolites associated with mineral, energy and protein metabolism in ways consistent with improvements in production and reproduction previously reported and the result suggests links between energy, protein and skeletal metabolism.",M1
20392232,"Interactions between breast, bone, and brain regulate mineral and skeletal metabolism during <e>lactation</e>.Mammalian reproduction requires that nursing mothers transfer large amounts of calcium to their offspring through milk. As a result, lactation is associated with dramatic alterations in bone and mineral metabolism, including reversible bone loss. One theme that has emerged from recent studies examining these adaptations is that the lactating breast actively participates in regulating bone and mineral metabolism. This review will detail our current knowledge of interactions between the breast, skeleton, and hypothalamus during lactation and will consider implications that this reproductive physiology has for the pathophysiology of osteoporosis and breast cancer.",M1
20391639,"Serum amyloid A and haptoglobin concentrations and liver fat percentage in lactating dairy cows with abomasal displacement.BACKGROUND: There has been increased interest in measuring the serum concentration of acute phase reactants such as serum amyloid A [SAA] and haptoglobin [haptoglobin] in periparturient cattle in order to provide a method for detecting the presence of inflammation or bacterial infection. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether [SAA] and [haptoglobin] are increased in cows with displaced abomasum as compared with healthy dairy cows. ANIMALS: Fifty-four adult dairy cows in early <e>lactation</e> that had left displaced abomasum (LDA, n = 34), right displaced abomasum or abomasal volvulus (RDA/AV, n = 11), or were healthy on physical examination (control, n = 9). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inflammatory diseases or bacterial infections such as mastitis, metritis, or pneumonia were not clinically apparent in any animal. Jugular venous blood was obtained from all cows and analyzed. Liver samples were obtained by biopsy in cattle with abomasal displacement. RESULTS: [SAA] and [haptoglobin] concentrations were increased in cows with LDA or RDA/AV as compared with healthy controls. Cows with displaced abomasum had mild to moderate hepatic lipidosis, based on liver fat percentages of 9.3 +/- 5.3% (mean +/- SD, LDA) and 10.8 +/- 7.7% (RDA/AV). [SAA] and [haptoglobin] were most strongly associated with liver fat percentage, r(s) = +0.55 (P &lt; .0001) and r(s) = +0.42 (P = .0041), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: An increase in [SAA] or [haptoglobin] in postparturient dairy cows with LDA or RDA/AV is not specific for inflammation or bacterial infection. An increase in [SAA] or [haptoglobin] may indicate the presence of hepatic lipidosis in cattle with abomasal displacement.",M1
20389219,"Lifestyle, occupational, and reproductive factors and risk of colorectal cancer.PURPOSE: Lifestyle factors and environmental exposures might help explain the risk of colorectal carcinoma in countries where the incidence is low, but unique patterns of young onset and a high proportion of rectal cancer exist. METHODS: We obtained detailed lifestyle information from 421 patients with colorectal cancer and 439 hospital-controls in Egypt. Logistic regression models were computed to evaluate the risk factors of colorectal carcinoma. RESULTS: A history of pesticide exposure and more frequently eating food directly from farms were significantly associated with a higher risk of colorectal carcinoma (odds ratio = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.1-5.9, and odds ratio = 4.6; 95% CI = 1.5-14.6, respectively). Parous women who reported 7 or more live births or breastfed for 19 months or longer per live birth had a significantly lower risk for colorectal carcinoma (odds ratio = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.2-0.7, and odds ratio = 0.2; 95% CI = 0.1-0.4, respectively). Compared with patients aged 40 years or older, industrial exposures were more common in younger patients (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Agricultural and industrial exposures were associated with increased risk of colorectal carcinoma, whereas prolonged <e>lactation</e> and increased parity were inversely associated with colorectal carcinoma in women. Further research to elucidate the biological role of intense environmental and industrial exposures and reproductive factors including lactation may further clarify the etiology of colorectal cancer.",M1
20380775,"Effect of CSN1S1 genotype and its interaction with diet energy level on milk production and quality in Girgentana goats fed ad libitum.A study was carried out to evaluate how the energy level of the diet can affect milk production and quality in Girgentana lactating goats in relation to polymorphism at the alphas1-casein (CSN1S1) genotype locus. Twenty-seven goats, homogeneous for milk production (1.5+/-0.3 kg/d), days of <e>lactation</e> (90+/-10 d) and body weight (35.8+/-5.5 kg) were selected on the basis of their CSN1S1 genotype, as follows: nine goats homozygous for strong (AA) alleles, nine goats homozygous for weak alleles (FF) and nine goats heterozygous (AF). The goats were used in a 3x3 factorial arrangement of treatments, with three genotypes (AA, FF, AF) and three diets at different energy levels (100%, 65% and 30% of hay inclusion). The experiment consisted of three simultaneous 3x3 Latin squares for the three genotypes, with one square for each level of hay inclusion in the diet. All the animals were housed in individual pens. Each experimental period lasted 23 d and consisted of 15 d for adaptation and 8 d for data and sample collection, during which the goats received the scheduled diet ad libitum. The animals were fed three different diets designed to have the same crude protein content (about 15%) but different energy levels: a pelleted alfalfa hay (H100) and two feeds including 65% (H65) and 30% (H30) of alfalfa hay (respectively 1099, 1386 and 1590 kcal NE for lactation/kg DM). All the diets were ground and pelleted (6 mm diameter). AA goats were more productive than AF and FF goats (respectively: 1419 v. 1145 and 1014 g/d; P=0.002). Indeed the interaction energy levelxgenotype was significant (P=0.018): in fact AA goats showed their milk increase only when fed with concentrates. Differences in protein and in casein levels between the three genotypes were in line with results expected from the different allele contribution to alphas1-casein synthesis. Milk urea levels were significantly lower in AA goats compared with AF and FF genotypes (respectively 32.7 v. 40.4 and 40.4 mg/dl; P=0.049) and significantly lower when goats were fed with 65H and 30H diets than with 100H diet (respectively 37.4 and 34.3 v. 41.7 mg/dl; P&lt;0.001). Indeed, a significant interaction genotypexdiet (P=0.043) occurred for milk urea, which was significantly lower in AA goats but only when fed with concentrates (65H and 30H). Blood concentrations of energy indicators (glucose, non-esterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyric acid) were not influenced by genotype. The results confirm that strong alleles are associated with a greater efficiency of feed utilization and seem to show that a high energy level of the diet can further improve this efficiency.",M1
20371969,"Effects of pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> on warfarin-induced changes in blood coagulation-related parameters in rats.Effects of pregnancy and lactation on warfarin-induced changes in blood coagulation-related parameters were examined in rats. Warfarin (0.5 mg/kg/day) was given orally to pregnant and non-pregnant rats for 3 days from gestation day (GD) 17 to 19 or to lactating and non-pregnant rats for 3 days from post partum day (PPD) 10 to 12. Blood samples were collected from the rats on the day following the last administration (GD 20 or PPD 13) to measure prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), thrombotest (TBT), factor VII and X activities and anti-thrombin III concentration (ATIII). Administration of warfarin to non-pregnant rats resulted in significant prolongation of APTT and TBT and significant decreases in factor VII and X activities. On the other hand, similar but not significant changes were observed in pregnant rats and similar significant but less prominent changes were observed in lactating rats. The reduction of the anticoagulant effects of warfarin may partially be related to high plasma 17beta-estradiol concentration in pregnant rats and to high plasma prolactin concentration in lactating rats, respectively.",M1
20352469,"Loss of CD24 expression promotes ductal branching in the murine mammary gland.CD24 is expressed on mammary stem cells and is used as a marker for their isolation, yet its function in the mammary gland still needs to be examined. Here we show that CD24 is expressed throughout the luminal epithelial cell layer, but only weakly in myoepithelial cells. During <e>lactation</e>, CD24 expression was suppressed within alveoli, but upregulated post-lactation, returning to a pre-pregnant spatial distribution. CD24-deficient mice exhibited an accelerated mammary gland ductal extension during puberty and an enhanced branching morphogenesis, resulting in increased furcation in the ductal structure. CD24-/- mammary epithelial cells were able to completely repopulate cleared mammary fat pads and to give rise to fully functional mammary glands. Together, these data suggest that while CD24 is expressed in mammary epithelium compartments thought to contain stem cells, CD24 is not a major regulator of mammary stem/progenitor cell function, but rather plays a role in governing branching morphogenesis.",M1
20338448,"Evaluation of five <e>lactation</e> curve models fitted for fat:protein ratio of milk and daily energy balance.Selection for milk yield increases the metabolic load of dairy cows. The fat:protein ratio of milk (FPR) could serve as a measure of the energy balance status and might be used as a selection criterion to improve metabolic stability. The fit of different fixed and random regression models describing FPR and daily energy balance was tested to establish appropriate models for further genetic analyses. In addition, the relationship between both traits was evaluated for the best fitting model. Data were collected on a dairy research farm running a bull dam performance test. Energy balance was calculated using information on milk yield, feed intake per day, and live weight. Weekly FPR measurements were available. Three data sets were created containing records of 577 primiparous cows with observations from lactation d 11 to 180 as well as records of 613 primiparous cows and 96 multiparous cows with observations from lactation d 11 to 305. Five well-established parametric functions of days in milk (Ali and Schaeffer, Guo and Swalve, Wilmink, Legendre polynomials of third and fourth degree) were chosen for modeling the lactation curves. Evaluation of goodness of fit was based on the corrected Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, correlation between the real observation and the estimated value, and on inspection of the residuals plotted against days in milk. The best model was chosen for estimation of correlations between both traits at different lactation stages. Random regression models were superior compared with the fixed regression models. In general, the Ali and Schaeffer function appeared most suitable for modeling both the fixed and the random regression part of the mixed model. The FPR is greatest in the initial lactation period when energy deficit is most pronounced. Energy balance stabilizes at the same point as the decrease in FPR stops. The inverted patterns indicate a causal relationship between the 2 traits. A common pattern was also observed for repeatabilities of both traits, with repeatabilities being largest at the beginning of lactation. Additionally, correlations between cow effects were closest at the beginning of lactation (r(c)=-0.43). The results support the hypothesis that FPR can serve as a suitable indicator for energy status, at least during the most metabolically stressful stage of lactation.",M1
20338447,"Combining somatic cell count traits for optimal selection against mastitis.Test-day records of somatic cell counts (SCC) can be used to define alternative traits to decrease genetic susceptibility to clinical mastitis (CM) and subclinical mastitis (SCM). This paper examines which combination of alternative SCC traits can be used best to reduce both CM and SCM and whether direct information on CM is useful in this respect. Genetic correlations between 10 SCC traits and CM and SCM were estimated from 3 independent data sets. The SCC traits with the strongest correlations with CM differed from those with the strongest correlations with SCM. Selection index calculations were made for a breeding goal of 50% CM and 50% SCM resistance using these correlations. They indicated that a combination of 5 SCC traits (SCC early and late in <e>lactation</e>, suspicion of infection based on increased SCC, extent of increased SCC, and presence of a peak pattern in SCC) gave a high accuracy, almost without loss, compared with the full set of 10 SCC traits. The estimated accuracy of this index was 0.91, assuming that the correlations had been estimated without error. To take errors in estimation into account, correlations were resampled from a normal distribution with mean and standard errors as originally estimated. The accuracy of the index calculated with the original correlations was then recalculated using the resampled correlations. The average accuracy based on 50,000 resamplings decreased to 0.81. Use of direct information on CM improved the accuracy (uncorrected for errors in correlations) only slightly, to 0.92.",M1
20338443,"Milk fatty acid profile and dairy sheep performance in response to diet supplementation with sunflower oil plus incremental levels of marine algae.In an attempt to develop strategies for enhancing the nutritional value of sheep milk fat, dairy ewe diet was supplemented with 3 incremental levels of marine algae (MA), in combination with sunflower oil, to evaluate the effects of these marine lipids on milk fatty acid (FA) profile and animal performance. Fifty Assaf ewes in mid <e>lactation</e> were distributed in 10 lots of 5 animals each and allocated to 5 treatments (2 lots per treatment): no lipid supplementation (control) or supplementation with 25 g of sunflower oil/kg of DM plus 0 (SO), 8 (SOMA(1)), 16 (SOMA(2)), or 24 (SOMA(3)) g of MA (56.7% ether extract)/kg of DM. Milk production and composition, including FA profile, were analyzed on d 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of treatment. Neither intake nor milk yield were significantly affected by lipid addition, but all MA supplements decreased milk fat content from d 14 onward, reaching a 30% reduction after 28 d on SOMA(3). This milk fat depression might be related not only to the joint action of some putative fat synthesis inhibitors, such as trans-9,cis-11 C18:2 and probably trans-10 C18:1, but also to the limited ability of the mammary gland to maintain a desirable milk fat fluidity, that would have been caused by the noticeable increase in trans-C18:1 together with the lowered availability of stearic acid for oleic acid synthesis through Delta(9)-desaturase. Furthermore, all lipid supplements, and mainly MA, reduced the secretion of de novo FA (C6:0-C14:0) without increasing the yield of preformed FA (&gt;C16). Supplementation with sunflower oil plus MA resulted in larger increases in cis-9,trans-11 C18:2 than those observed with sunflower oil alone, achieving a mean content as high as 3.22% of total FA and representing a more than 7-fold increase compared with the control. Vaccenic acid (trans-11 C18:1) was also significantly enhanced (on average +794% in SOMA treatments), as was C22:6 n-3 (DHA) content, although the transfer efficiency of the latter, from the diets to the milk, was very low (5%). However, the highest levels of MA inclusion (SOMA(2) and SOMA(3)) reduced the milk n-6:n-3 ratio, but MA supplements caused an important increase in trans-10 C18:1, which would rule out the possibility that this milk has a healthier fat profile before determining the specific role of each individual FA and ensuring that this trans-FA is at least innocuous in relation to cardiovascular disease risk.",M1
20338438,"Changes in milk fatty acid profile and animal performance in response to fish oil supplementation, alone or in combination with sunflower oil, in dairy ewes.Ruminant diet supplementation with sunflower oil (SO) and fish oil (FO) has been reported as a good strategy for enhancing some milk fat compounds such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in dairy cows, but no information is available regarding dairy sheep. In this work, ewe diet was supplemented with FO, alone or in combination with SO, with the aim of improving milk nutritional value and evaluating its effect on animal performance. Sixty-four Assaf ewes in mid <e>lactation</e>, fed a high-concentrate diet, were distributed in 8 lots of 8 animals each and assigned to 4 treatments (2 lots/treatment): no lipid supplementation (control) or supplementation with 20 g of SO/kg (SO), 10 g of FO/kg (FO), or 20 g of SO plus 10 g of FO/kg (SOFO). Milk production and composition, including a complete fatty acid profile, were analyzed on d 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of treatments. Supplementation with FO tended to reduce dry matter intake compared with the control treatment (-15%), and its use in combination with SO (SOFO) resulted in a significant decrease in milk yield as well (-13%). All lipid supplements reduced milk protein content, and FO also reduced milk fat content by up to 21% alone (FO) and 27% in combination with SO (SOFO). Although the mechanisms involved in FO-induced milk fat depression are not yet well established, the observed increase in some milk trans-FA that are putative inhibitors of milk fat synthesis, such as trans-9,cis-11 CLA, and the 63% decrease in C18:0 (consistent with the theory of reduced milk fat fluidity) may be involved. When compared with the control, lipid supplementation remarkably improved the milk content of rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11 CLA; up to 4-fold increases with SO and SOFO diets), whereas FO-containing diets also increased milk n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly docosahexaenoic acid (with mean contents of 0.29 and 0.38% of total fatty acids for SOFO and FO, respectively), and reduced the n-6:n-3 FA ratio to approximately half the control value. All lipid supplements resulted in high levels of some trans-FA, mainly trans-11 C18:1 (vaccenic acid) but also trans-10 C18:1.",M1
20338437,"Associations of elevated nonesterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations with early <e>lactation</e> reproductive performance and milk production in transition dairy cattle in the northeastern United States.The objectives were to evaluate the effects of elevated pre- and postpartum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentrations during the transition period on reproductive performance and milk production in dairy cattle. In a prospective cohort study of 91 freestall, total mixed ration-fed herds in the northeastern United States, blood samples were collected from approximately 15 prepartum and 15 different postpartum transition animals in each herd. All samples were stratified based on pre- or postpartum status at the time of sample collection, and 2,259 and 2,290 animals were used to evaluate reproductive and milk production performance, respectively. Reproductive performance was assessed by time to conception within 70 d post-voluntary waiting period (VWP) and milk production was assessed using mature-equivalent 305-d (ME305) milk yield estimated at 120 d in milk. While controlling for body condition score (BCS), calving season, median ME305 milk production, and parity, NEFA and BHBA concentrations were evaluated with time to event analysis to investigate reproductive performance. These same predictor variables were used to determine the effects of elevated NEFA and BHBA concentrations on ME305 milk yield with herd as a random effect. Heifers and cows were grouped in the final analyses if the results between groups were similar. In all animals sampled prepartum, the risk of pregnancy within 70 d post-VWP was reduced by 19% when NEFA concentrations were &gt;or=0.27 mEq/L. In all animals sampled postpartum, those with NEFA concentrations &gt;or=0.72 mEq/L had a 16% decrease in risk of pregnancy and those with BHBA concentrations &gt;or=10mg/dL had a 13% decrease in risk. In cows and heifers, ME305 milk yield was decreased by 683 kg when prepartum NEFA concentrations were &gt;or=0.33 mEq/L. In heifers sampled postpartum, ME305 milk yield was increased by 488 kg when NEFA concentrations were &gt;or=0.57 mEq/L and increased by 403 kg when BHBA concentrations were &gt;or=9 mg/dL. In cows sampled postpartum, ME305 milk yield was decreased by 647 kg when NEFA concentrations were &gt;or=0.72 mEq/L and decreased by 393 kg when BHBA concentrations were &gt;or=10mg/dL. With the exception of milk production in heifers, this study indicates that increased concentrations of serum NEFA and BHBA had a detrimental effect on reproductive performance and milk production.",M1
20338435,"Associations of soft flooring materials in free stalls with milk yield, clinical mastitis, teat lesions, and removal of dairy cows.The objective was to test if there was an association between free-stall base softness and milk yield, incidence of clinical mastitis (CM), teat lesions, and removal of cows. In a questionnaire sent to 1,923 dairy farms presumed to be using free-stall housing, farmers were asked for information regarding housing and stall base; for example, the year of installation and the product name or brand of their mats or mattresses. This information was merged with data for milk yield, CM, teat lesions, and removal of cows extracted from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System for the years after installation of mats or mattresses. After exclusion of invalid contributions, the data set consisted of 29,326 <e>lactations</e> for milk yield distributed over 363 free-stalled herds in Norway. The farms were stratified into 5 categories according to the softness of the stall surface measured as millimeter impact of a sphere with a diameter of 120 mm at 2-kN load: 1=concrete, softness of 0mm; 2=rubber, softness of 1 to 8mm; 3=soft mats, softness of 9 to 16 mm; 4=multilayer mats, softness of 17 to 24 mm; and 5=mattresses, softness over 24 mm. Lactation curves were estimated as modified Wood's lactation curves using test-day data and mixed models with repeated measurements, adjusting for days in milk, parity, and softness of free-stall flooring. Herds on concrete free-stall bases yielded 6,727+/-146 kg of milk from 5 to 305 days in milk. In comparison, herds showed a decrease of 0.3% on rubber, an increase of 2.4% on soft mats, an increase of 4.5% on multilayer mats, and an increase of 3.9% on mattresses. Compared with concrete, the hazard ratio (HR) of CM was less on rubber, multilayer mats, and mattresses [HR=0.89 (0.79-0.99), 0.85 (0.73-0.996), and 0.80 (0.73-0.88), respectively]. Compared with concrete, the HR of teat lesions was less on rubber, soft mats, multilayer mats, and mattresses [HR=0.41 (0.26-0.65), 0.33 (0.24-0.44), 0.12 (0.04-0.38), and 0.47 (0.33-0.67), respectively]. The HR of removal of cows was less on mattresses compared with concrete, rubber, soft mats, and multilayer mats, with HR=0.90 (0.84-0.97), 0.88 (0.80-0.97), 0.86 (0.80-0.93), and 0.85 (0.76-0.95), respectively. A soft free-stall base contributed significantly to increased milk yield and fewer incidences of CM, teat lesions, and removal of cows.",M1
20338434,"The use of a cephalonium containing dry cow therapy and an internal teat sealant, both alone and in combination.The dry period is a critical time in the <e>lactation</e> cycle, being the optimum time to cure existing intramammary infection (IMI) as well as encompassing the periods of highest susceptibility to new infection. Currently, IMI in the dry period is controlled with antibiotic dry cow therapy. The aim of this randomized control trial was to investigate different dry cow therapy regimens by stratifying cows by likely infection status at drying off in herds with low somatic cell count (SCC; bulk milk SCC &lt;250,000 cells/mL) in southwest England. All quarters in 890 cows were recruited. The recruited cows were categorized as either infected or uninfected on the basis of SCC and clinical mastitis history. Ipsilateral quarters within each cow were randomly allocated to receive 1 of 4 different treatment regimens according to their infection category. Quarters in high-SCC infected cows were allocated to receive antibiotic dry cow therapy either alone or in combination with an internal teat sealant; quarters in low-SCC uninfected cows were allocated to receive teat sealant either alone or in combination with antibiotic dry cow therapy. All quarters were sampled for bacteriology at drying off and again within 10 d post-calving. Quarters were subsequently monitored for clinical mastitis for the first 100 d of lactation. The mass of residual sealant was assessed immediately post-calving to allow assessment of the association of sealant retention with treatment efficacy. Models were constructed to assess the efficacy of the different regimens in preventing IMI. Apparent cure rates of existing IMI with major pathogens were consistently &gt;90% in quarters receiving antibiotic. Combination treatment of high-SCC infected cows resulted in an increased likelihood of being pathogen free post-calving (odds ratio=1.40; 95% credibility interval=1.03-1.90). The benefits of combination treatment of low-SCC uninfected cows were less clear. With respect to clinical mastitis, combination treatment of high-SCC infected cows resulted in a decreased likelihood of developing clinical mastitis in the first 100 d of the subsequent lactation (odds ratio=0.68; 95% credibility interval=0.48-0.98). The retention of the internal sealant was adversely affected by its use in combination with antibiotic dry cow therapy.",M1
20338431,"Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry-based milk metabolomics in dairy cows during early and late <e>lactation</e>.Milk production in dairy cows has dramatically increased over the past few decades. The selection for higher milk yield affects the partitioning of available nutrients, with more energy being allocated to milk synthesis and less to physiological processes essential to fertility and fitness. In this study, the abundance of numerous milk metabolites in early and late lactation was systematically investigated, with an emphasis on metabolites related to energy metabolism. The aim of the study was the identification and correlation of milk constituents to the metabolic status of the cows. To investigate the influence of lactation stage on physiological and metabolic variables, 2 breeds of different productivity were selected for investigation by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We could reliably quantify 44 different milk metabolites. The results show that biomarkers such as acetone and beta-hydroxybutyrate are clearly correlated to the metabolic status of the individual cows during early lactation. Based on these data, the selection of cows that cope well with the metabolic stress of early lactation should become an option.",M1
20338427,"Effect of bovine somatotropin (500 mg) administered at ten-day intervals on ovulatory responses, expression of estrus, and fertility in dairy cows.The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of administering 500 mg of recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST) every 10 d on ovulatory responses, estrous behavior, and fertility of lactating Holstein cows. Lactating dairy cows were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: a control with no administration of bST (73 primiparous and 120 multiparous cows) or 6 consecutive administrations of 500 mg of bST (83 primiparous and 123 multiparous cows) given subcutaneously at 10-d intervals starting 61+/-3 d postpartum (study d 0), concurrent with the initiation of the timed artificial insemination (AI). Blood samples were collected thrice weekly from 61+/-3 to 124+/-3 d in milk (DIM), and plasma samples were analyzed for concentrations of estradiol, glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and progesterone. The estrous cycle of cows was presynchronized with 2 injections of PGF(2alpha) at 37+/-3 and 51+/-3 DIM, and the Ovsynch timed AI protocol was initiated at 61+/-3 DIM. Ovaries were scanned to determine ovulatory responses during the Ovsynch protocol. Pregnancy was diagnosed at 33 and 66 d after AI. Body condition was scored on study d 0, 10, 42, and 76. Sixty-four cows were fitted with a pressure mounting sensor with radiotelemetric transmitters to monitor estrous behavior. Treatment of lactating dairy cows with 500 mg of bST at 10-d intervals increased yields of milk and milk components in the first 2 mo after treatment. Body condition of bST-treated cows remained unaltered, whereas control cows gained BCS. Treatment with bST increased concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 chronically, but concentrations of insulin and glucose increased only transiently in the first 7 d after the first injection of bST. Concentrations of progesterone during and after the Ovsynch protocol remained unaltered after treatment with bST; likewise, ovulatory responses during the Ovsynch protocol were mostly unaltered by treatment. Concentration of estradiol tended to be greater for bST cows than for control cows immediately before induction of ovulation in the Ovsynch protocol. Similarly, the mean and the peak concentrations of estradiol were greater for bST cows than for control cows when monitored during spontaneous estrus. Nevertheless, duration of estrus and the median number of standing events were less for bST cows than for control cows. Pregnancies per AI after the first and second postpartum inseminations were not affected by bST treatment. Treatment of lactating dairy cows with 500 mg of bST every 10 d improved <e>lactation</e> performance, but it did not affect pregnancies per AI and it reduced expression of estrus.",M1
20338425,"Mammary remodeling in primiparous and multiparous dairy goats during <e>lactation</e>.Milk production is generally lower but lactation persistency higher in primiparous (PP) than in multiparous (MP) goats. This may be related to differences in development and maintenance of mammary gland function, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The present study aimed to elucidate whether differences in lactational performance between PP and MP mammary glands are related to the time course of development and maintenance, not only of the mammary epithelial cell (MEC) population, but also of the mammary vasculature that sustains synthetic activity. Mammary biopsies were obtained from both mammary glands of 3 PP and 6 MP (&gt;or=2 parity) dairy goats at parturition (d 1), d 10, 60, and 180 of lactation. Gene transcription relating to MEC turnover and vascular function was quantified by real-time reverse transcription-PCR, mammary morphology was characterized (quantitative histology), and cell turnover was determined (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and Ki-67). Primiparous glands showed higher expression for the genes involved in angiogenesis; namely, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and angiopoietin 1 and 2 and their receptor, a few days after parturition (d 10). Primiparous glands also had higher rates of MEC proliferation in early lactation. It therefore appears that initiation of lactation is associated with development and growth of the mammary gland into early lactation, which continues for a longer period in PP compared with MP glands. In addition, MEC survival was found to be higher in PP glands throughout lactation, and MEC in PP glands underwent more extensive differentiation. This could explain the reported flatter lactation curve and higher lactation persistency in PP glands. Although some of the genes included in this study were differentially expressed in PP and MP glands during the course of lactation, it was not possible to identify any specific genomic factor(s) that could account for the differences between PP and MP glands with respect to mammary development and MEC survival during lactation. It remains to be established why parity number affects MEC and vascular development and survival during lactation, and, in particular, which regulatory mechanisms are involved.",M1
20338417,"Composition, coagulation properties, and cheesemaking potential of milk from cows undergoing extended <e>lactations</e> in a pasture-based dairying system.Extending the lactation length of dairy cows beyond the traditional 10 mo toward lactations of up to 22 mo has attracted interest in the pasture-based seasonal dairying systems of Australia and New Zealand as a way of alleviating the need for cows to conceive during peak lactation, such as is required to maintain seasonally concentrated calving systems. Lactation lengths longer than 10 mo instead provide cows with more time to cycle and conceive after parturition and may therefore be more suitable systems for high-producing Holstein-Friesian cows. Before recommending such systems there is a need to evaluate the effects of long lactations on the suitability of milk for manufacture of high-quality dairy products. In the current experiment, the composition of milk from cows entering the second half of a 22-mo lactation was examined in detail and compared with that from cows undergoing a traditional 10-mo lactation. On 2 occasions, coagulation properties were measured using low amplitude strain oscillation rheometry, and Cheddar cheese was made in 250-L pilot-scale vats. Results showed that milk from extended lactations had higher concentrations of fat and protein than cows undergoing 10-mo lactations under similar management conditions and at the same time of year. The ratio of casein to true protein was not affected by lactation length and neither were the proportions of individual caseins. The increase in milk solids during extended lactations translated into a more rapid rate of coagulation and ultimately a firmer curd on one of the two occasions. Milk from extended lactations yielded more cheese per 100 kg of milk, and there were few differences in the composition or organoleptic properties of the cheese. These data are the first to show that pasture-based dairy industries could embrace the use of extended lactations without compromising the core business of producing high-quality dairy products.",M1
20338409,"Invited review: ruminant ecology and evolution: perspectives useful to ruminant livestock research and production.The article reviews ruminant ecology and evolution and shows insights they offer into livestock research. The first ruminants evolved about 50 million years ago and were small (&lt;5 kg) forest-dwelling omnivores. Today there are almost 200 living ruminant species in 6 families. Wild ruminants number about 75 million, range from about 2 to more than 800 kg, and generally prefer at least some browse in their diets. Nine species have been domesticated within the last 10,000 yr. Their combined population currently numbers 3.6 billion. In contrast to wild ruminants, domestic species naturally prefer at least some grass in their diets, are of large body weight (BW; roughly from 35 to 800 kg), and, excepting reindeer, belong to one family (Bovidae). Wild ruminants thus have a comparatively rich ecological diversity and long evolutionary history. Studying them gives a broad perspective that can augment and challenge the status quo of ruminant research and production. Allometric equations, often used in ecology, relate BW to physiological measurements from several species (typically both wild and domestic). They are chiefly used to predict or explain values of physiological parameters from BW alone. Results of one such equation suggest that artificial selection has increased peak milk energy yield by 250% over its natural level. Voluntary feed intake is proportional to BW(0.9) across wild and domestic ruminant species. This proportionality suggests that physical and metabolic factors regulate intake simultaneously, not mutually exclusively as often presumed. Studying the omasum in wild species suggests it functions primarily in particle separation and retention and only secondarily in absorption and other roles. Studies on the African Serengeti show that multiple species, when grazed together, feed such that they use grasslands more completely. They support the use of mixed-species grazing systems in production agriculture. When under metabolic stress, wild species will not rebreed, but rather will extend <e>lactation</e> (to nourish their current offspring). This bolsters the suggestion that lactation length be extended in dairy operations. Cooperation between animal scientists and ecologists could generate more valuable insight.",M1
20329650,"Serum fructosamine concentrations in relation to metabolic changes during late pregnancy and early <e>lactation</e> in mares.The changes in blood serum fructosamine concentrations as indicators of glycaemia during a longer period of time were investigated in mares during late pregnancy and early lactation, as well as their relationship to the changes in the concentration of biochemical indicators of energetic status. The samples were taken from eleven mares on 60 +/- 10 and 20 +/- 10 days before foaling, and 20 +/- 10 and 60 +/- 10 days after foaling. Concentrations of serum fructosamine, non-esterified fatty acids and triglycerides were higher during late pregnancy (from P &lt; 0.05 to P &lt; 0.0005), while the concentrations of beta- hydroxybutyrate increased significantly (P &lt; 0.00001) during early lactation. A significant correlation between the concentrations of fructosamine and metabolic parameters was observed. The results indicate a relationship between energetic status and serum fructosamine in mares. Higher concentrations of fructosamine are related to the adaptation to late pregnancy. Therefore, the measurement of the serum fructosamine concentrations could serve as an indicator of energetic status of mares during pregnancy and lactation.",M1
20329646,"Influence of animal, herd and management factors on perinatal mortality in dairy cattle--a survey in Thuringia, Germany.It was the aim of this study to identify cow/calf, herd and management risk factors on perinatal mortality (PM) in dairy herds from the German federal state of Thuringia. Perinatal mortality was defined as cases of stillborn calves or calves having died within 24 h after birth. From a representative sample of 53 herds (breeds: Holstein Friesian and crossbreedings between Holstein Friesian and Blackpied Dairy Cow), dairy herd improvement (DHI) records were obtained providing information about number of calvings, frequency of PM, parity, calving ease, gender, twin calvings and herd milk yield. Management practices (farm organisation, breeding policies, calving management, hygienic measures, feeding, status of infectious diseases) were recorded using a questionnaire filled in whilst interviewing the herd owner. Data of one year from 46 herds with 13 158 calvings were analysed using logistic regression models applying generalised estimation equations (GEE). The overall frequency of PM was 9.3%. The odds ratio for PM was 5.89, 1.73, 1.68 and 1.67 in cases of dystocia, heifer calving, twin and male calves, respectively. None of the management factors examined in this study remained as significant effects for PM in the final logistic regression model. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that cow/calf related factors reported as risk factors for PM in many studies in the past such as dystocia, number of <e>lactation</e>, gender and twins were also major determinants of PM in commercial dairy herds in Thuringia. Besides applying appropriate breeding policies herd owners should primarily consider ways of further improving calving management with proper calving supervision and correct calving assistance in order to reduce the risk of PM.",M1

Total splenectomy was considered to be the treatment needed, both to make a definitive diagnosis and to exclude the presence of malignancy.",M1
20199221,"Lack of adverse effects of whole-body exposure to a mobile telecommunication electromagnetic field on the rat fetus.Abstract The recent steep increase in the number of users of cellular phones is resulting in marked increase of exposure of humans to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs). Children are of particular concern. Our goal was to evaluate potential adverse effects of long-term whole-body exposure to EMFs simulating those from base stations for cellular phone communication. Pregnant rats were given low, high or no exposure. At the high level, the average specific absorption rate (SAR)for the dams was 0.066-0.093 W/kg. The SAR for the fetuses and the F(1) progeny was 0.068-0.146 W/kg. At the low level, the SARs were about 43% of these. The 2.14 GHz signals were applied for 20 h per day during the gestation and <e>lactation</e> periods. No abnormal findings were observed in either the dams or the F(1) generation exposed to the EMF or in the F(2) offspring. Parameters evaluated included growth, gestational condition and organ weights for dams and survival rates, development, growth, physical and functional development, hormonal status, memory function and reproductive ability of the F(1) offspring (at 10 weeks of age) along with embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in the F(2) rats. Thus, under our experimental conditions, whole-body exposure to 2.14 GHz for 20 h per day during gestation and lactation did not cause any adverse effects on pregnancy or the development of rats.",M1
20195946,"High fat programming induces glucose intolerance in weanling Wistar rats.We sought to determine whether maintenance on a high fat diet during defined periods of gestation and <e>lactation</e> induced glucose intolerance in weanling Wistar rats or affected food intake, weight, and glucose concentrations in mothers. Experimental groups comprised mothers and their weanling offspring maintained on a high fat diet during gestation and lactation (HFGL), during gestation only (HFG), or during lactation only (HFL). Maternal food intake, body weight, and fasting blood glucose concentrations were determined during lactation. Glucose tolerance was measured in the three-week-old weanling offspring. After overnight fasting, oral glucose tolerance tests were performed in the weanlings. Glucose was collected at (0), 10, 15, 30 and 60 min. HFGL and HFL weanlings had greater glucose concentrations compared to control weanlings at 10, 15, 30 and 60 min. For HFG weanlings, greater glucose concentrations were only found at 30 min, which normalized at 60 min. In all of the experimental groups, the highest glucose concentrations were demonstrated at 30 min, whereas the peak was achieved at 15 min in the control weanlings. Overt glucose intolerance was induced in weanlings maintained on a high fat diet throughout both gestation and lactation or throughout lactation only. Further, weanlings maintained on a high fat diet solely throughout gestation displayed milder glucose intolerance. Developmental programming with a high fat diet during defined periods of gestation and lactation induces glucose intolerance in weanling rats.",M1
20190011,"Nicotine exposure affects mother's and pup's nutritional, biochemical, and hormonal profiles during <e>lactation</e> in rats.We have shown that maternal nicotine exposure during lactation has long-lasting effects on body adiposity and hormonal status of rat offspring. Here, we studied the nutritional and hormonal profiles in this experimental model. Two days after birth, osmotic minipumps were implanted in lactating rats divided into two groups: NIC - continuous s.c. infusions of nicotine (6 mg/kg per day) for 14 days and C - saline. Dams and pups were killed at 15 and 21 days of lactation. Body weight and food intake were evaluated. Milk, blood, visceral fat, carcass, and adrenal gland were collected. All the significant data were P&lt;0.05. At the end of nicotine exposure (15 days), dams presented higher milk production, hyperprolactinemia, and higher serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Milk from NIC dams had higher lactose concentration and energy content. After nicotine withdrawal (21 days), dams showed lower food intake and hyperleptinemia. The 15-day-old NIC pups presented higher total body fat, higher HDL-C, serum leptin, serum corticosterone, and adrenal catecholamine content, but lower tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels. The 21-day-old NIC pups had higher body protein content and serum globulin. Thus, maternal nicotine exposure during lactation results in important changes in nutritional, biochemical, and hormonal parameters in dams and offspring. The pattern of these effects is clearly distinct when comparing the nicotine-exposed group to the withdrawal group, which could be important for the programming effects observed previously.",M1
20188245,"Effects of maternal plasmid GHRH treatment on offspring growth.To differentiate prenatal effects of plasmid growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) treatment from maternal effects mediated by <e>lactation</e> on long-term growth of offspring, a cross-fostering study was designed. Pregnant sows (n=12) were untreated (n=6) or received either a Wt-GHRH (n=2) or HV-GHRH (n=4) plasmid. At birth, half of each litter was cross-fostered (treated to controls and controls to treated only). Piglets from plasmid-injected sows were heavier at birth (HV-GHRH, 1.65+/-0.07kg; Wt-GHRH, 1.46+/-0.05kg vs. Controls, 1.27+/-0.03kg; P&gt;or=0.001) and at weaning (Wt-GHRH, 6.01+/-0.21kg and HV-GHRH, 6.34+/-0.15kg vs. Controls, 5.37+/-0.14kg; P&gt;or=0.02, respectively). Control piglets cross-fostered to plasmid-injected sows grew faster to weaning (Wt-GHRH, 5.61+/-0.15kg and HV-GHRH, 5.70+/-0.29kg vs. Controls, 5.08+/-0.22kg; P&gt;0.05, respectively). Piglets from plasmid-injected sows that suckled on control sows were larger than control piglets on control sows (Wt-GHRH, 5.93+/-0.20kg and HV-GHRH, 6.2+/-0.19kg vs. Controls, 5.08+/-0.22kg; P&gt;0.05, respectively), but smaller than their littermates left on their treated mothers. The observed improvements were maintained until the end of the study when the offspring were 170-day-old. The results suggest that the improved growth of offspring of GHRH plasmid-treated sows pre-weaning is attributable to improved maternal performance, while after weaning the effects on the pituitary component are relevant.",M1
20184907,"Pelage insulation, litter size, and ambient temperature impact maternal energy intake and offspring development during <e>lactation</e>.Energy balance during lactation critically influences survival and growth of a mother's offspring, and hence, her reproductive success. Most experiments have investigated the influence of a single factor (e.g., ambient temperature [T(a)] or litter size) on the energetics of lactation. Here, we determined the impact of multiple interventions, including increased conductive heat loss consequent to dorsal fur removal, cold exposure (T(a) of 5 degrees C versus 23 degrees C), and differential lactational load from litters of different sizes (2 or 4 pups), on maternal energy balance and offspring development of Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). Lower T(a), fur removal, and larger litters were associated with increased maternal food consumption. Females exposed to multiple challenges (e.g., both fur loss and lower T(a)) ate substantially more food than those exposed to a single challenge, with no apparent ceiling to elevated food intake (increases up to 538%). Thus, energy intake of dams under these conditions does not appear to be limited by feeding behavior or the size of the digestive tract. Housing at 5 degrees C attenuated pup weight gain and increased pup mortality to more than 5 times that of litters housed at 23 degrees C. Increases in the dam's conductive heat loss induced by fur removal did not affect pup weight gain or survival, suggesting that effects of low T(a) on pup weight gain and survival reflect limitations in the pups' ability to ingest or incorporate energy.",M1
20181296,"Expression and function of leptin and its receptor in dairy goat mammary gland.Leptin is an autocrine and paracrine factor which affects the development and function of mammary gland. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence and regulatory effect of leptin in Chinese Guan Zhong dairy goat mammary gland from the virgin state to involution. The protein expression and localization of leptin and its long form receptor (OB-Rb) were detected by western blot and a confocal laser scanning microscope. Explants were cultured to detect the impacts of leptin on mammary gland, western blot was used to research leptin signal transduction pathway in pregnancy, <e>lactation</e> and involution. Leptin and amounts of OB-Rb protein were high throughout the virgin stage and at the beginning of pregnancy, lower at mid-pregnancy and throughout lactation, then higher at involution. Immunofluorescence performed with the anti-leptin and anti-leptin receptor antibody showed labelling located in adipose, epithelial cells, or extracellular matrix at different stages. The localization of leptin and OB-Rb revealed that leptin induced the expression of OB-Rb specifically and controlled the development and physiological function of the mammary gland by binding to OB-Rb. Leptin stimulated the proliferation and differentiation of ductal epithelial cells in pregnancy by JAK-MAPK signal pathway, enhanced the amount of beta-casein in cultured lactating mammary gland by JAK-STAT5 signal pathway, made the mammary duct disappear and induced apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells and mammary gland restitution by JAK-STAT3 signal pathway in involution.

Intraductal surveillance of mammary epithelium has the potential to allow for earlier detection based on changes in function of the epithelium. This study investigated the feasibility of using intraductal impedance spectroscopy (IIS) to assess changes in resistance in the mammary epithelium in a small group of female rats in resting, pregnant and ultimately lactating states. In resting rats, intraductal surveillance was able to detect only a single resistive capacitance (RC). In pregnant animals, a second RC became evident in the frequency range between 1 and 190 Hz. The real resistance of this low frequency RC increased when measurements were made after the animals had begun lactating. Equivalent circuit modeling revealed this increase to be a 1.7-fold change from pregnancy to <e>lactation</e>. A model of tight junction closure in the context of ductal expansion is proposed. These results suggest that physiologic measurements can be made in rodent mammary epithelium using this technique allowing for assessment of function in normal and disease states.",M1
20173222,"[Dermatological treatment during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e>]Since wellbeing and health have become fashionable and widespread polypragmasia is popular, adverse drug reactions are particularly important medical problem. Pregnant women as well as breast-feeding mothers need very particular care from the physician. Treatment during pregnancy or lactation is a more complicated issue not only because it concerns at least two persons, but also because of the many anatomical and functional differences between the adult and fetus or newborn organism. The safety aspects of dermatological treatment during pregnancy and lactation are presented. Both topical and systemic treatment, mainly for bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic dermatoses and acne, alopecia, psoriasis, and autoimmunological processes, are discussed.Moreover, the most recent methods of dermatological treatment are mentioned taking into consideration their safety during pregnancy and lactation. Furthermore, the traditional drug classification made by the United States Food and Drug Administration as well as the most modern division, which is under construction, are presented.",M1
20172248,"Extended <e>lactations</e> in a seasonal-calving pastoral system of production to modulate the effects of reproductive failure.This study was conducted to determine whether extending the calving interval (CI) to 24 mo would be an alternative to culling and replacing cows that had failed to become pregnant. Forty-six nonpregnant lactating cows were assembled in November 2004 and assigned to receive either 3kg (low) or 6kg (high) of concentrate supplement and a basal diet of grass silage and maize silage over the winter period (13 wk). Cows returned to pasture in late March and received 1kg of concentrate/d until dry-off (milk yield &lt;5 kg/d). Cumulative milk production was calculated from calving to the end of November 2004 (12-mo CI) and from the start of December 2004 until dry off in 2005 (extended lactation part of 24-mo CI). High winter feeding resulted in greater milk production over the winter confinement (20.0+/-0.3 vs. 17.8+/-0.3 kg/d for high and low winter feeding, respectively) and had a carryover effect during the remainder of the 24-mo CI period (5,177 vs. 4,686kg; SEM=173kg). At the end of the study, cows were ranked on cumulative milk solids and separated into 3 groups (R1, R2, and R3). During the 24-mo CI, milk yields were 7,287, 6,267, and 5,273kg (SEM=308kg) in yr 1, and 5,738, 4,836, and 4,266 (SEM=241kg) in yr 2 for R1, R2, and R3, respectively. Eighty-five percent of the cows became pregnant during the breeding season of yr 2, with a conception rate to first service of 52%. An economic analysis of different ranks with a 12-mo CI, a 24-mo CI, and an annualized herd effect, which compared an efficient spring calving system with 30% recycled cows in R1 and 10% recycled cows in R3, was carried out. Farm profit was reduced by 60% and 65% at a milk price of 22.3 euro-cents (c)/L with the corresponding values of 17% and 30% for a milk price of 30 c/L, respectively, when R1 and R3 systems were compared with an efficient spring milk (12-mo CI) production system. Within a spring system where 30% and 10% of R1 and R3 animals were subjected to extended lactations, the profit difference was reduced compared with an efficient spring system, The results indicated that lactations with a 24-mo CI may be a viable alternative to culling nonpregnant cows and be economically more suited to higher producing cows.",M1
20172242,"Relationships between milk yield and somatic cell score in Canadian Holsteins from simultaneous and recursive random regression models.Multiple-trait random regression animal models with simultaneous and recursive links between phenotypes for milk yield and somatic cell score (SCS) on the same test day were fitted to Canadian Holstein data. All models included fixed herd test-day effects and fixed regressions within region-age at calving-season of calving classes, and animal additive genetic and permanent environmental regressions with random coefficients. Regressions were Legendre polynomials of order 4 on a scale from 5 to 305 d in milk (DIM). Bayesian methods via Gibbs sampling were used for the estimation of model parameters. Heterogeneity of structural coefficients was modeled across (the first 3 <e>lactations</e>) and within (4 DIM intervals) lactation. Model comparisons in terms of Bayes factors indicated the superiority of simultaneous models over the standard multiple-trait model and recursive parameterizations. A moderate heterogeneous (both across- and within-lactation) negative effect of SCS on milk yield (from -0.36 for 116 to 265 DIM in lactation 1 to -0.81 for 5 to 45 DIM in lactation 3) and a smaller positive reciprocal effect of SCS on milk yield (from 0.007 for 5 to 45 DIM in lactation 2 to 0.023 for 46 to 115 DIM in lactation 3) were estimated in the most plausible specification. No noticeable differences among models were detected for genetic and environmental variances and genetic parameters for the first 2 regression coefficients. The curves of genetic and permanent environmental variances, heritabilities, and genetic and phenotypic correlations between milk yield and SCS on a daily basis were different for different models. Rankings of bulls and cows for 305-d milk yield, average daily SCS, and milk lactation persistency remained the same among models. No apparent benefits are expected from fitting causal phenotypic relationships between milk yield and SCS on the same test day in the random regression test-day model for genetic evaluation purposes.",M1
20172239,"The genetic relationship of body weight and early-<e>lactation</e> health disorders in two experimental herds.The objectives of this study were to estimate genetic parameters for body weight (BW) and BW change (BWC) and genetic correlations of BW and BWC with diseases and genomic predicted transmitting abilities (PTA) of productive and conformation traits of Holsteins during the first 120 DIM. Daily BW data were from the Afiweigh cow body weighing system (SAE Afikim, Kibbutz Afikim, Israel), which records BW as a cow exits the milking parlor. Disease categories included metabolic diseases, ketosis, infectious diseases, mastitis, reproductive diseases, and other diseases. Edited data included 68,914 and 11,615 daily BW observations from 441 Pennsylvania State University and 72 Virginia Tech Holstein cows, respectively. Two-trait random regression models were used to estimate relationships between BW, BWC, and diseases at 25, 38, and 58 mo of age at calving. Fixed effects for BW were age at calving nested within lactation group, week of lactation, and herd date; random effects for BW included animal, permanent environment, and error. Fixed effects for disease were herd-year-season of calving and age at calving nested within lactation group; random effects for disease were animal, permanent environment (for mastitis only), and error. Correlations of PTA for BW and BWC with genomic PTA for productive and type traits were also estimated with data from 117 cows. Heritability estimates for daily BW ranged from 0.34 to 0.63. Greater BW and less BWC were favorably correlated with ketosis, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, and other diseases. The genetic correlation estimate between BW and ketosis was strongest at 60 DIM (-0.51), and genetic correlation estimates at 60 DIM with metabolic diseases (-0.52), infectious diseases (-0.81), and other diseases (-0.48) followed the same trend as ketosis. The genetic correlation estimate between BWC and ketosis was strongest for the change from 5 to 20 DIM (0.70) and was similar for metabolic diseases (0.37), infectious diseases (0.74), and other diseases (0.49). Correlations of BW and BWC with reproductive diseases tended to be in the reverse direction of those reported for ketosis. A larger PTA for BW was significantly correlated with smaller genomic PTA for milk yield, dairy form, rear udder height, and udder cleft. Predicted transmitting ability for BWC was negatively correlated with genomic PTA for protein percentage, strength, and hip width (ranging from -0.26 to -0.13 across lactation) and was positively correlated with dairy form, rear udder height, and udder cleft (ranging from 0.20 to 0.37 across lactation). Selection for reduced BW loss can be implemented with automated body weighing systems and may be successful in decreasing disease incidence in the early stages of lactation.",M1
20172234,"Effects of dietary supplementation of rumen-protected conjugated linoleic acid to grazing cows in early <e>lactation</e>.Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are potent anticarcinogens in animal and in vitro models as well as inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis in mammary gland, liver, and adipose tissue. Our objective was to evaluate long-term CLA supplementation of lactating dairy cows in tropical pasture on milk production and composition and residual effects posttreatment. Thirty crossbred cows grazing stargrass (Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst var. nlemfüensis) were blocked by parity and received 150 g/d of a dietary fat supplement of either Ca-salts of palm oil fatty acids (control) or a mixture of Ca-salts of CLA (CLA treatment). Supplements of fatty acids were mixed with 4 kg/d of concentrate. Grazing plus supplements were estimated to provide 115% of the estimated metabolizable protein requirements from 28 to 84 d in milk (treatment period). The CLA supplement provided 15 g/d of cis-9,trans-11 and 22g of cis-10,trans-12. Residual effects were evaluated from 85 to 112 d in milk (residual period) when cows were fed an 18% crude protein concentrate without added fat. The CLA treatment increased milk production but reduced milk fat concentration from 2.90 to 2.14% and fat production from 437 to 348 g/d. Milk protein concentration increased by 11.5% (2.79 to 3.11%) and production by 19% (422 to 504 g/d) in the cows fed CLA. The CLA treatment decreased milk energy concentration and increased milk volume, resulting in unchanged energy output. Milk production and protein concentration and production were also greater during the residual period for the CLA-treated cows. The CLA treatment reduced production of fatty acids (FA) of all chain lengths, but the larger effect was on short-chain FA, causing a shift toward a greater content of longer chain FA. The CLA treatment increased total milk CLA content by 30% and content of the trans-10,cis-12 CLA isomer by 88%. The CLA treatment tended to decrease the number of days open, suggesting a possible effect on reproduction. Under tropical grazing conditions, in a nutritionally challenging environment, CLA-treated cows decreased milk fat content and secreted the same amount of milk energy by increasing milk volume and milk protein production.",M1
20172228,"Technical note: variation in daily milk yield calculations for dairy cows milked in an automatic milking system.An accurate estimation of the daily milk yield of dairy cows milked in an automatic milking system is not obvious because of variations in milking intervals and frequencies. Daily harvested milk varies substantially, and developing a method to be used for estimating daily milk production is of great importance. Three calculation methods (simple, semiadvanced, and advanced) were used. The simple method calculated rough daily milk production by summing up the yield per day. The semiadvanced used yield in combination with time since last milking to calculate the milk production per hour between milking; an average of the milk production per hour over the day was calculated and multiplied by 24. The advanced method calculated the milk production from midnight to midnight by using information about yield and time since last milking to calculate the exact milk production. The results show a clear preference for the advanced calculation method because the variation [variation for the advanced method=ln(1.79) for first <e>lactation</e> and ln(2.28) for later lactations] between days was reduced significantly (3 to 4 times lower compared with the simple method). Variation in daily harvested milk can be used as a management tool.",M1
20172223,"Association between Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection and milk production in two California dairies.The association between Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) and milk production was estimated on 2 California dairies using longitudinal data from 5,926 cows. Both study herds had moderate MAP seroprevalence, housed cows in freestalls, and had Johne's disease control programs. Cow MAP status was determined using both serum ELISA and fecal culture results from cows tested at dry-off and from whole-herd tests. Potential confounders were evaluated based on a causal diagram. Mixed models with 2 functions (splines) for days in milk (DIM) representing milk production pre- and postpeak used in similar studies were further modified to use each cow's observed DIM at peak and <e>lactation</e> length. Cows that were seropositive produced 2.5kg less 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM) per day than their seronegative herdmates. In addition, cows that were fecal-culture positive by liquid culture and confirmed by PCR produced 2.2kg less 4% FCM per day than their fecal-culture negative herdmates. The decrease in milk production in MAP test-positive compared with test-negative cows started in the second lactation. A switch in MAP status in either ELISA or fecal culture results from positive to negative had no significant association with milk production. Modified DIM functions that used the observed DIM at peak had better model fit than another function that assumed a fixed peak at 60 DIM. Cows that tested positive for MAP on serum ELISA or fecal culture produced less milk than cows that tested negative, and the association between MAP and milk production was not confounded by mastitis, elevated somatic cell counts, or uterine or metabolic cow conditions.",M1
20172221,"Effect of a high cornstarch diet on hepatic cytochrome P450 2C and 3A activity and progesterone half-life in dairy cows.In the cow, inadequate concentrations of progesterone during gestation may lead to an abrupt termination of pregnancy. The primary organ involved in progesterone catabolism is the liver, which contains an abundance of cytochrome P450 isozymes (EC 1.14.14.1; mixed-function monooxygenases). The objectives of the current experiment were to determine the effect of feeding 2 isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets, formulated to cause divergent insulin secretion, on hepatic cytochrome P450 2C (CYP2C) and 3A (CYP3A) activity as well as the resulting biological half-life of progesterone. Twenty-two Holstein cows averaging 80+/-7 d in milk were randomly assigned to either a high cornstarch diet or a high fiber diet in a crossover experimental design consisting of two 14-d periods. Dry matter intake, milk yield, milk lactose yield, and milk lactose percentage were similar between the 2 diets. Milk fat yield and milk fat percentage were higher in cows fed the high fiber diet, whereas milk protein yield tended to be higher and milk protein percentage was higher in cows fed the high cornstarch diet. Energy balance tended to be improved by 57% in cows consuming the high cornstarch diet. Insulin concentrations at the time of liver biopsy (3.16+/-0.04h post-feeding) were increased by 44% in cows consuming the high cornstarch diet compared with cows consuming the high fiber diet. Cytochrome P450 2C activity was decreased by 45%, whereas CYP3A activity tended to be lowered by 34% in cows consuming the high cornstarch diet. Cytochrome P450 2C mRNA expression tended to be decreased by 21% in cows fed the high cornstarch diet, whereas CYP3A mRNA expression was not different between the dietary treatments. The fractional rate constant of progesterone decay was not different between the 2 diets; however, the half-life of progesterone tended to be longer in cows fed the high cornstarch diet compared with cows fed the high fiber diet (85 vs. 64min, respectively). In summary, cows consuming the high cornstarch diet had increased insulin concentrations and lower hepatic CYP2C and CYP3A activity and tended to have a longer progesterone half-life compared with cows consuming the high fiber diet. Feeding diets that stimulate insulin secretion could alter progesterone clearance during <e>lactation</e>, when dairy cows have increased rates of progesterone inactivation because of high energy demands and increased DMI.",M1
20172217,"Effect of days to conception in the previous <e>lactation</e> on the risk of death and live culling around calving.The objective was to quantify the effect of days to conception (days open) in the previous parity on the risk of death and live culling (excluding the disposal reasons  dairy purposes  and  death ) in the proximity of a subsequent calving in Holstein cows enrolled in the Dairy Herd Improvement program. After edits, 2,075,834 observations of cows calving between 2001 and 2007 in herds located in 36 US states primarily east of the Mississippi river were available. The period at risk included the time between 14 d before expected calving to 60 d after calving. Days open were categorized in 6 periods: 0 to 45 d, 46 to 90 d, 91 to 150 d, 151 to 210 d, 211 to 300 d, and 301 to 600 d after calving in the previous parity. Other variables of interest included parity, length of the dry period before calving, relative last test-day milk yield before dry off before calving, season of calving, and the cow's relative 305-d mature equivalent (305ME) milk yield before calving. Control variables were calving year, herd size, and relative herd 305ME milk yield. All variables were categorized. Generalized mixed models were used and included herd as random effect. Interactions between days open and the variables of interest were included in the models. Least squares means for the risk of death between -14 and 60 d after calving were 2.5, 2.5, 2.9, 3.6, 4.4, and 5.8% for increasing categories of days open. Similarly, for the same categories, least squares means for the risk of live culling were 4.5, 5.0, 5.4, 6.1, 6.9, and 8.1%. The effect of days open on the risk of death was slightly greater for third-parity cows, for long dry periods, for cows with low test-day milk yield before dry off before calving, for spring calvings, and for intermediate relative 305ME milk yield before calving. Similar trends for these interactions were found for the risk of live culling, except for relative 305ME milk yield before calving, where the effect of days open was more pronounced for high-producing cows. In conclusion, increased days open in the previous parity were associated with a greater risk of death and live culling around calving.",M1
20170714,"Dephosphorylation/inactivation of tyrosine hydroxylase at the median eminence of the hypothalamus is required for suckling-induced prolactin and adrenocorticotrop hormone responses.We have recently found that dopamine (DA) released from terminals of the hypothalamic neuroendocrine dopamine (NEDA) neurons plays a role not only in prolactin (PRL), but also in adrenocorticotrop hormone (ACTH) secretion, without having any influence on alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) release in lactating dams. The aim of our present studies was to further investigate this DAerg regulation of ACTH using consecutively applied physiological stimulation (suckling) and pharmacological inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme of DA synthesis (tyrosine hydroxylase, TH) by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MpT) that acutely affect secretion of these pituitary hormones during <e>lactation</e>. Following 4h separation period, two experimental groups were formed. In the first group, lactating rats were assembled with their litters for 60 min prior to alpha-MpT. In the second group, the alpha-MpT was injected first and 60 min later suckling stimulus was applied. Plasma samples were taken in every 15 min during the 90 min experimental period. Concentrations of plasma PRL, ACTH and alpha-MSH were measured by specific RIAs. Both stimuli applied in the first sequence, significantly elevated plasma PRL and ACTH levels in separated lactating dams, without having any effect on alpha-MSH secretion. Suckling applied in the first sequence was able to block the alpha-MpT-induced elevation of ACTH secretion, while PRL response was also significantly attenuated. alpha-MpT pretreatment prevented both PRL and ACTH responses to suckling stimulus. Investigating the dephosphorylation/inactivation of TH in the arcuate nucleus-ME (TIDA) regions, no pTH-immunoreactive perikarya or terminals can be found in continuously suckled dams. In contrast, after 4h separation of the mothers from their litters, pTH-immunoreactivity can be clearly visualized in the external zone of ME. In alpha-MpT pretreated mothers following 4h separation no pTH positive terminals are visible. No changes in the TH immunostaining can be observed in any of these experimental groups. In conclusion, dephosphorylation/inactivation of TH (the rate-limiting enzyme of the DA biosynthesis) in NEDA neurons is required for suckling-induced PRL and ACTH responses.",M1
20169930,"Some physicochemical bone parameters of sows fed microbial phytase-supplemented diet.The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of microbial phytase addition to sow diets on a mineral content, mineralization level and geometric parameters of femoral and humeral bone. The studies were done on 75 sows assigned to 3 feeding groups. The animals from group I (positive control) were fed a diet of standard calcium and phosphorus dietary contents which complied with the requirements of the Polish Norms for Pig Nutrition (1993). The sows from group II (negative control) received a diet without an inorganic phosphorus content and finally, group III was provided with a diet without an inorganic phosphorus additive, but supplemented with microbial phytase (500 PU kg(-1)) and formic acid. After <e>lactation</e> completion and piglet weaning, 4 sows were selected from each group for slaughter and laboratory evaluation of femoral and humeral bone samples. The bone samples were examined for a content of dry matter, crude ash and minerals (phosphorus, Ca+2, Mg+2, Mn+2, Zn+2, Cu+2). The isolated femurs were analyzed for a mineralization degree and geometric parameters. A combined microbial phytase with formic acid supplementation significantly increased manganese and zinc concentration in femoral bone and a level of phosphorus, calcium, zinc and iron in humeral bone of sows. There was also observed significantly higher trabecular bone mineral density (Td) in the femoral bone as well as the bone volume. The evaluation of geometric parameters and bone cortical indices showed a significant influence of the sow feedstuff supplementation with microbial phytase and formic acid on the parameters studied.",M1
20167061,"Rumen-protected conjugated linoleic acid supplementation to dairy cows in late pregnancy and early <e>lactation</e>: effects on milk composition, milk yield, blood metabolites and gene expression in liver.BACKGROUND: Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a collective term for isomers of octadecadienoic acid with conjugated double-bond system. Thus, it was the objective to investigate whether milk composition and metabolic key parameters are affected by adding CLA to the diet of dairy cows in the first four weeks of lactation. METHODS: A study was carried out with five primiparous cows fed a CLA supplemented diet compared to five primiparous cows without CLA supplementation. CLA supplemented cows received 7.5 g CLA/day (i.e. 50% cis(c)9,trans(t)11- and 50% t10,c12-CLA) starting two weeks before expected calving and 20 g CLA/day (i.e. 50% c9,t11- and 50% t10,c12-CLA) throughout day 1 to 28 of lactation. RESULTS: The CLA supplement was insufficiently accepted by the animals: only 61.5% of the intended amount was ingested. Fed CLA were detectable in milk fat, whereas contents of c9,t11-CLA and t10,c12-CLA in milk fat were higher for CLA supplemented cows compared to the control group. On average over the entire treatment period, there was a decrease of saturated fatty acids (FA) in milk fat of CLA supplemented cows, combined with a higher content of monounsaturated and trans FA.Our study revealed no significant effects of c9,t11- and t10,c12-CLA supplementation either on milk yield and composition or on metabolic key parameters in blood. Furthermore the experiment did not indicate significant effects of c9,t11- and t10,c12-CLA-supplementation on gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), PPARgamma, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in liver tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Feeding c9,t11- and t10,c12-CLA during the first weeks after calving did not affect metabolic key parameters of blood serum or milk composition of fresh cows. Milk fatty acid composition was changed by feeding c9,t11- and t10,c12-CLA resulting in higher contents of these isomers in milk fat. High contents of long chain FA in milk fat indicate that CLA supplementation during the first four weeks of lactation did not affect massive peripheral lipomobilization.",M1
20164145,"Developmental neurotoxicity study of dietary bisphenol A in Sprague-Dawley rats.This study was conducted to determine the potential of bisphenol A (BPA) to induce functional and/or morphological effects to the nervous system of F(1) offspring from dietary exposure during gestation and <e>lactation</e> according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for the study of developmental neurotoxicity. BPA was offered to female Sprague-Dawley Crl:CD (SD) rats (24 per dose group) and their litters at dietary concentrations of 0 (control), 0.15, 1.5, 75, 750, and 2250 ppm daily from gestation day 0 through lactation day 21. F(1) offspring were evaluated using the following tests: detailed clinical observations (postnatal days [PNDs] 4, 11, 21, 35, 45, and 60), auditory startle (PNDs 20 and 60), motor activity (PNDs 13, 17, 21, and 61), learning and memory using the Biel water maze (PNDs 22 and 62), and brain and nervous system neuropathology and brain morphometry (PNDs 21 and 72). For F(1) offspring, there were no treatment-related neurobehavioral effects, nor was there evidence of neuropathology or effects on brain morphometry. Based on maternal and offspring body weight reductions, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for systemic toxicity was 75 ppm (5.85 and 13.1 mg/kg/day during gestation and lactation, respectively), with no treatment-related effects at lower doses or nonmonotonic dose responses observed for any parameter. There was no evidence that BPA is a developmental neurotoxicant in rats, and the NOAEL for developmental neurotoxicity was 2250 ppm, the highest dose tested (164 and 410 mg/kg/day during gestation and lactation, respectively).",M1
20163652,"Relationship between the <e>lactation</e> curve and udder disease incidence in different lactation stages in first-lactation Holstein cows.We examined the relationships between the shape of the first parity lactation curve and udder disease incidence at different stages of lactation in 538 Holstein cows. Data used were first-parity daily milk yields and treatment records. Each cow was classified according to whether or not it had had udder disease at least once over the whole lactation period or in one of three stages within the lactation period. We then examined the differences in the shapes of the lactation curves between the disease incidence and non-incidence group in each stage. Cows that had high rates of increase in milk yield and high milk yields in early lactation were predisposed to udder disease afterwards. Cows with high milk production over a long period but with low lactation persistency were predisposed to udder disease after the peak of lactation. There was no difference in total milk yield between incidence and non-incidence groups in all stages, suggesting that, for a comparable level of lactation, cows without udder diseases have flatter lactation curves.",M1
20163634,"Effect of fortifying concentrate supplement with fibrolytic enzymes on nutrient utilization, milk yield and composition in lactating goats.Thirty lactating Beetle-sannen crossbred goats were randomly divided into 3 groups based on first fortnight milk yield, and then adjusted to body weights to study the effect of fibrolytic enzyme supplementation on digestibility and milk production. Goats in the control group (C) were fed 500 g of concentrate supplement (CS) without exogenous fibrolytic enzymes (control; CG) or CS fortified with cellulase and xylanases @ of 4000 and 12500 (EG(1)) or 8000 and 18 750 IU/kg (EG(2)), respectively. CS was offered in two equal proportions just after milking at 7 and 17 h. After feeding CS, goats were fed 1200 g of wheat straw as roughage in two equal parts at 08.00 and 18.00 hours. Milk yield was studied for 3 1/2 months. Milking was done by hand. Changes in body weight were also recorded. After a preliminary period of 60 days of feeding, a 7-day digestibility trial was conducted in two intervals with 5 animals from each group at a time. The increase in either wheat straw or NDF intake due to the enzyme mixture was only 3%. There was significant improvement (P &lt; 0.05) in the diet digestibility of DM, OM, CP, NDF, ADF and total carbohydrates (TC) between the control and EG(1) and EG(2) goats. Improvements were greater (P &lt; 0.05) in the latter group. Microbial protein (MBP) was estimated based on purine derivatives and creatinine excreted in spot urine samples. MBP increased about 10 and 15% in EG(1) and EG(2), but these values were statistically invalid. Phenomenally milk yield, fat and SNF were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) changed with progression of <e>lactation</e>. On a temporal basis, fortnightly changes in FCM yield of this study could be grouped as 1 month each of first and last and 1 1/2 of middle phase of lactation. Repeated measure analysis showed 180 to 260 mL/day of higher FCM and 16 to 20 g/day of higher SNF yield (P &lt; 0.001) in EG(2) than control or even EG(1) during 5 to 7th fortnight. However, no significant impact (P &gt; 0.05) was noticed on TF. Feed intake, g/kg FCM yield was also 7% less in EG(2) than either CG or EG(1). The study concluded that apart from increased digestibility, fortification of CS with cellulase and xylanases enzymes improved FCM yield in the last quarter of lactation in goats, and improved body weights by 5% (P &gt; 0.05). While the digestibility of the diet was higher in EG(1) and EG(2), the impact on FCM and SNF yield was noticed only on EG(2). Our study indicated that CS of lactating goats may be fortified with 8000 and 18 500 IU/kg CS in the last quarter of lactation.",M1
20162920,"Breast cancer risk in women: the protective role of pregnancy.Many countries have experienced a pronounced shift towards later childbearing in recent years.

Breast cancer constitutes the most common cancer in women and is an important public health concern worldwide. Early age at full-term pregnancy lowers the risk of breast cancer in women, whereas in older women first full-term pregnancy appears to increase the risk. <e>Lactation</e> seems to be relatively important in reducing the risk and abortion is associated neither with increased nor reduced risk.

20160134,"Maternal dietary fat determines metabolic profile and the magnitude of endocannabinoid inhibition of the stress response in neonatal rat offspring.Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are products of phospholipid (PL)-derived arachidonic acid (AA) that regulate hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. We hypothesized that differences in the quality and quantity of maternal dietary fat would modulate the PL AA content in the neonatal brain affecting stress responsiveness via differences in eCB production and activity in stress-activated brain areas. Pregnant rats were fed a 5% [control (C)] or 30% fat [high fat (HF)] diet rich in either n-6 (HF-n-6) or n-3 (HF-n-3) fat during the last week of gestation and <e>lactation</e>. Postnatal d 10 offspring were tested for metabolic hormones, AA (n-6) and eCB brain content, and hormonal effects of eCB receptor antagonism (AM251, 1 or 3 mg/kg ip) on stress responses. Like maternal diet, milk from HF-n-3 mothers had a reduced n-6/n-3 fat ratio compared with that of C and HF-n-6 mothers. Hypothalamic and hippocampal levels of PL AA were diet specific, reflecting the maternal milk and dietary n-6/n-3 ratio, with HF-n-3 offspring displaying reduced AA content relative to C and HF-n-6 offspring. Plasma corticosterone and insulin were elevated in HF-fed pups, whereas leptin was increased only in HF-n-6 pups. Basal eCB concentrations were also diet and brain region specific. In C pups, eCB receptor antagonist pretreatment increased stress-induced ACTH secretion, but not in the HF groups. Stress-induced corticosterone secretion was not sensitive to AM251 treatment in HF-n-3 pups. Thus, the nature of preweaning dietary fat differentially influences neonatal metabolic hormones, brain PL AA levels, and eCB, with functional consequences on hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis modulation in developing rat pups.",M1
20158884,"Housing system and herd size interactions in Norwegian dairy herds; associations with performance and disease incidence.BACKGROUND: According to the Norwegian animal welfare regulations, it has been forbidden to build new tie-stall barns since the end of 2004. Previous studies have shown that cow performance and health differ between housing systems. The interaction between housing system and herd size with respect to performance and disease incidence has not been evaluated. METHODS: Cow performance and health in 620 herds housed in free-stall barns were compared with in 192 herds housed in tie-stall barns based on a mail survey and data from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording and Cattle Health Systems. The housing systems herds were comparable with respect to herd size (15-55 cows). Associations between performance/disease incidence and housing system, herd size and year of building the cow barn were tested in general linear models, and values for fixed herd size of 20 and 50 cows were calculated. On the individual cow level mixed models were run to test the effect of among others housing system and herd size on test-day milk yield, and to evaluate <e>lactation</e> curves in different parities. All cows were of the Norwegian Red Breed. RESULTS: Average milk production per cow-year was 134 kg lower in free-stall herd than in tie-stall herds, but in the range 27-45 cows there was no significant difference in yields between the herd categories. In herds with less than 27 cows there were increasingly lower yields in free-stalls, particularly in first parity, whereas the yields were increasingly higher in free-stalls with more than 45 cows.In free-stalls fertility was better, calving interval shorter, and the incidence rate of teat injuries, ketosis, indigestions, anoestrus and cystic ovaries was lower than in tie-stalls. All of these factors were more favourable in estimated 50-cow herds as compared to 20-cow herds. In the larger herd category, bulk milk somatic cell counts were higher, and the incidence rate of mastitis (all cases) and all diseases was lower. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that there is an interaction between housing system and herd size, and that performance and health is not universally better in small free-stalls than in tie-stalls.",M1
20156465,"Physiological variables explain mineral intake in Iberian red deer.Foraging theory predicts that animals should be able to assess nutrient content of food sources and adjust their diet according to needs. As many minerals are essential nutrients, animals should be able to discriminate and consume the amount needed for each mineral. Although this has been proved for sodium and phosphorus, it is not clear if animals can discriminate among other essential minerals, and if they do so based on physiological needs. Requirements depend on sex, age, and physiological status, and thus usually vary greatly among individuals. Thus, if animals behave as optimal foragers of minerals, factors affecting individual physiological needs should also affect intake behaviour of each mineral. We tested this prediction in Iberian red deer. During two <e>lactation</e> periods a series of containers with different minerals, most of them diluted in salt, were offered to 59 adult hinds and their calves while consumption behaviour was recorded. Study animals were monitored weekly and milk production was assessed during the experiment. All the lactation variables influenced mineral consumption, and the effect differed for each mineral. Models explained a higher proportion of variability in calf than hind behaviour, reflecting probably a greater constraint as a result of growth needs. Thus, results show that deer can select mineral content in their diet and that selection is shaped by physiological effort as expected if consumption is driven by physiological needs.",M1
20150580,"<e>Lactation</e> and bone turnover: a conundrum of marked bone loss in the setting of coupled bone turnover.CONTEXT: Mothers who exclusively breastfeed lose up to 10% of their bone mass. This is primarily mediated by PTHrP, in combination with low estrogen levels. The mechanisms underlying this marked bone loss are unknown. Uncoupling of bone turnover, which is seen in other prototypical states of bone loss, would seem the likely explanation. However, the most current markers of bone turnover have not been studied in human lactation. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess bone formation in lactating humans using the most current bone turnover markers. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a prospective cohort study with repeated measures of bone metabolism in a volunteer sample of 49 women, recruited into three study groups: lactating, bottle feeding, and healthy controls. The postpartum women were studied at 6-8 and 12-14 wk postpartum, whereas the controls were studied at the follicular phase of their menstrual cycles. OUTCOME MEASURES: Biochemical markers of bone turnover were assessed. RESULTS: Mean serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen, a sensitive marker of bone resorption, was approximately 2-fold higher in lactating women as compared with bottle-feeding and healthy controls (P = 0.037 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). Surprisingly, amino-terminal telopeptides of procollagen 1, the most current marker of bone formation, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin were all significantly higher in the lactating group as compared with controls (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.002, and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to prototypical states of rapid bone loss (myeloma, cancer, and immobilization) in which markers of bone turnover display marked uncoupling, lactational bone loss, as assessed in this small exploratory study, is distinct, showing comparably rapid bone loss in the face of apparent osteoclast-osteoblast coupling.",M1
20150276,"The bHLH/PAS transcription factor singleminded 2s promotes mammary gland lactogenic differentiation.We have previously demonstrated that the bHLH/PAS transcription factor, singleminded 2s (Sim2s), is required for proper mammary ductal morphogenesis and luminal epithelial differentiation. Furthermore, loss of Sim2s in breast cancer cells resulted in downregulation of epithelial markers and acquisition of a basal-like phenotype. The objective of this study was to further define the role of Sim2s in mammary differentiation. We found that Sim2s is developmentally regulated throughout mammary gland development with highest expression during <e>lactation</e>. Mammary glands from nulliparous mice expressing Sim2s driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter were morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type mice but displayed hallmarks of precocious lactogenic differentiation. These included elevated expression of the milk protein genes Wap and Csn2, and apical localization of the lactation marker Npt2b. Consistent with the in vivo results, Sim2s enhanced prolactin-mediated Csn2 expression in HC11 and CIT3 mouse mammary epithelial cells, and downregulation of Sim2s by shRNA in HC11 cells inhibited Csn2 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses of the Csn2 gene found that Sim2s associates with the Csn2 promoter and re-ChIP experiments showed that Sim2s interacted with the RNA II polymerase (RNAPII) complex. Together, these data demonstrate, for the first time, that Sim2s is required for establishing and maintaining mammary gland differentiation.",M1
20105659,"Neonatal tolerance under breastfeeding influence: the presence of allergen and transforming growth factor-beta in breast milk protects the progeny from allergic asthma.Once the umbilical cord has been cut, immunologists have often looked at the neonate as an entity that develops on its own. For years, breast milk was considered mainly as a source of nutrients for the developing child. The extensive observations that breastfeeding affords protection toward infectious diseases and could reduce by more than the half the mortality rate because of common infections have added another key role to breastfeeding. This protection relies in great part on the passive transfer through breast milk of high amounts of microbe-specific immunoglobulins that compensate for the deficiency of immunoglobulins synthesis during the first year of life. Here, we will present and discuss our data showing how breast milk can actively shape the immune response of the progeny, particularly in the context of allergic disease. Indeed, our data obtained in a mouse model suggest that the protection attributed to breastfeeding toward asthma development might rely on immune tolerance induction. For this to occur, the mother mice needed to be exposed to the allergen by aerosol or oral route during the <e>lactation</e> period, which resulted into the transfer of the allergen to breast milk. The presence of the allergen together with transforming growth factor-beta in breast milk was necessary and sufficient to induce the development of regulatory T lymphocytes in the progeny and their protection from asthma development. If confirmed in human beings, this study may suggest new strategies for asthma prevention such as deliberate exposure of mother to allergens during breastfeeding and qualitative modification of artificial milks.",M1
20146015,"Regulation of food consumption during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> in mice.The aim of the present work was to assess the expression of agouti-like protein and neuropeptide Y in pregnant and lactating mice and to compare this with the leptin level and food consumption. Food consumption, blood leptin levels, and agouti-like protein and neuropeptide Y mRNA levels in the hypothalamus of C57Bl/6J mice were assessed on days 7, 13, and 18 of pregnancy and on days 10 and 21 of lactation, and in virgin females of the same ages. During pregnancy, food consumption and leptin levels decreased on day 7 and increased in day 18 of pregnancy, while neuropeptide Y mRNA levels increased on day 13 and then remained unaltered, and the agouti-like protein level increased on day 18. After parturition, food consumption continued to increase, while leptin levels and neuropeptide Y mRNA levels decreased to normal. Thus, hyperphagia in pregnancy was due to sequential activation of the expression of neuropeptide Y and agouti-like protein, while in lactation hyperphagia resulted from mechanisms not associated with changes in the expression of these neuropeptides.",M1
20143039,"Communally breeding bats use physiological and behavioural adjustments to optimise daily energy expenditure.Small endotherms must change roosting and thermoregulatory behaviour in response to changes in ambient conditions if they are to achieve positive energy balance. In social species, for example many bats, energy expenditure is influenced by environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature, and also by social thermoregulation. Direct measurements of daily fluctuations in metabolic rates in response to ambient and behavioural variables in the field have not been technologically feasible until recently. During different reproductive periods, we investigated the relationships between ambient temperature, group size and energy expenditure in wild maternity colonies of Bechstein's bats (Myotis bechsteinii). Bats used behavioural and physiological adjustments to regulate energy expenditure. Whether bats maintained normothermia or used torpor, the number of bats in the roosts as well changed with reproductive status and ambient temperature. During pregnancy and <e>lactation</e>, bats remained mostly normothermic and daily group sizes were relatively large, presumably to participate in the energetic benefits of social thermoregulation. In contrast, smaller groups were formed on days when bats used torpor, which occurred mostly during the post-lactation period. Thus, we were able to demonstrate on wild animals under natural conditions the significance of behavioural and physiological flexibility for optimal thermoregulatory behaviour in small endotherms.",M1
20140511,"Effects of first postpartum progesterone rise, metabolites, milk yield, and body condition score on the subsequent ovarian activity and fertility in lactating Holstein dairy cows.Seventy multiparous healthy lactating Holstein cows (fat-corrected milk yield = 7,561.8 kg) were monitored from 14 days before to 70 days after calving. Transrectal ultrasound scanning was performed twice weekly from 7 to 65 days postpartum. Blood samples were also collected twice weekly to measure serum P(4) and biweekly to detect serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations. Body condition score (BCS) was taken biweekly after calving. Based on the serum P(4) profile of 59 cows (11 cows were excluded due to the occurrence of postpartum diseases) studied, 27 (45.8%) had normal ovarian activity, while 21 (35.6%), six (10.1%), three (5.1%), and two (3.4%) had delayed ovulation (DOV), prolonged luteal phase (PLP), short luteal phase (SLP), and cessation of ovarian activity, respectively. Cows with PLP had an earlier ovulation compared to that of cows with normal ovarian activity (23.16 +/- 4.02 vs 31.9 +/- 8.35 days; P &lt; 0.05). PLP cows also had a greater mean +/- standard deviation peak milk yield (44.2 +/- 5.8 vs 37.2 +/- 5.7 kg/day, 75 days postpartum; P &lt; 0.05) than cows with normal postpartum ovarian activity. The PLP group also had greater milk production in the previous <e>lactation</e> period. Logistic regression analysis indicated that cows with P(4) concentration &gt; or =1 ng/ml on day 24 after calving were more at risk for PLP by 1.1 for each 1 kg increase in mean peak milk yield during 75 days after calving. BCS was lower in cows with DOV compared to that of cows with normal ovarian activity at any time after calving (P &lt; 0.05). Serum betaHB concentrations in DOV cows were significantly higher than that of normal cows on day 42 after calving (0.69 +/- 0.29 vs 0.54 +/- 0.12 mmol/L, P &lt; 0.05). No significant difference was found in the mean concentrations of NEFA between cows in different groups at any time after calving (P &gt; 0.05). The concentrations of P(4) on days 28 and 31 were negatively correlated with betaHB concentration on day 42 after calving in cows with normal ovarian activity (R = -0.44, P = 0.02). In conclusion, these findings suggest that early ovulation and hence early postpartum P(4) rise in addition to the high milk production could partly be responsible for the occurrence of PLP in dairy cows.",M1
20139678,"Role of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in neurodevelopment and growth.There has been intense interest in the role of the n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), in growth and development of infants. In 2009, there are at least twelve published randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the effects of LCPUFA supplementation of infant formula for preterm infants and seventeen RCTs involving formula-fed term infants. In addition, at least five RCTs have investigated the effect of DHA supplementation during pregnancy and/or <e>lactation</e> on infant and early child development. Collectively, the published literature has demonstrated no harm of dietary LCPUFA for infants regardless of whether they are born preterm or at term. However, developmental benefit is more consistently observed in infants born preterm. This may be explained by the fact that DHA accretion to neural tissues peaks during the fetal brain growth spurt in the last trimester of pregnancy. Infants born preterm are denied the full gestation period to accumulate DHA and are at risk of incomplete DHA accumulation. New research is focused on the timing and dose of DHA supplementation needed to optimize developmental outcomes.",M1
20139617,"Determination of sialyl and neutral oligosaccharide levels in transition and mature milks of Samoan women, using anthranilic derivatization followed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography.An improved analytical method using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography following anthranilic acid derivatization for the measurement of each oligosaccharide level in transition (5 to 10 d <e>lactation</e>) and mature (21 to 155 d lactation) milks of sixteen Samoan women is described. The method was applied for the measurement of sialyl as well as neutral oligosaccharide levels. We found that disialyllacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT), sialylacto-N-tetraose c (LSTc), and 6'-sialyllactose (6'-SL) were the most abundant of the sialyl oligosaccharides. In the neutral oligosaccharide fraction, lacto-N-fucopentaose II and III combined (LNFP II+III) were the most dominant, followed by lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) and 3-fucosyllactose (3-FL). 2'-Fucosyllactose (2'-FL) and lacto-N-fucopentaose I (LNFP I) were absent in some and found at low levels in most of the Samoan women. Our study indicates that the milk oligosaccharide composition in Samoan women is similar to that of Japanese women with respect to sialyl but not to neutral oligosaccharides. The differences in neutral oligosaccharides might have a genetic origin.",M1
20139144,"Use of a prolactin-Cre/ROSA-YFP transgenic mouse provides no evidence for lactotroph transdifferentiation after weaning, or increase in lactotroph/somatotroph proportion in <e>lactation</e>.In rats, a shift from somatotroph dominance to lactotroph dominance during pregnancy and lactation is well reported. Somatotroph to lactotroph transdifferentiation and increased lactotroph mitotic activity are believed to account for this and associated pituitary hypertrophy. A combination of cell death and transdifferentiation away from the lactotroph phenotype has been reported to restore non-pregnant pituitary proportions after weaning. To attempt to confirm that a similar process occurs in mice, we generated and used a transgenic reporter mouse model (prolactin (PRL)-Cre/ROSA26-expression of yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)) in which PRL promoter activity at any time resulted in permanent, stable, and highly specific EYFP. Triple immunochemistry for GH, PRL, and EYFP was used to quantify EYFP+ve, PRL-ve, and GH+ve cell populations during pregnancy and lactation, and for up to 3 weeks after weaning, and concurrent changes in cell size were estimated. At all stages, the EYFP reporter was expressed in 80% of the lactotrophs, but in fewer than 1% of other pituitary cell types, indicating that transdifferentiation from those lactotrophs where reporter expression was activated is extremely rare. Contrary to expectations, no increase in the lactotroph/somatotroph ratio was seen during pregnancy and lactation, whether assessed by immunochemistry for the reporter or PRL: findings confirmed by PRL immunochemistry in non-transgenic mice. Mammosomatotrophs were rarely encountered at the age group studied. Individual EYFP+ve cell volumes increased significantly by mid-lactation compared with virgin animals. This, in combination with a modest and non-cell type-specific estrogen-induced increase in mitotic activity, could account for pregnancy-induced changes in overall pituitary size.",M1
20138069,"Prenatal flavor exposure affects growth, health and behavior of newly weaned piglets.Young animals can learn about flavors from the maternal diet that appear in the amniotic fluid and mother's milk, which may reduce neophobia for similarly flavored food types at weaning. Flavor learning may be beneficial for piglets, which after the rather abrupt weaning in pig husbandry frequently show a period of anorexia, reduced health, and stress-induced behaviors. We investigated the effects of pre- and postnatal flavor exposure through the maternal diet on acceptance of a similarly flavored food and subsequent growth, health and behavior of newly weaned piglets. Sows were offered anise-flavored (F) or control (C) food during late gestation. Piglets were cross-fostered after birth, with each sow fostering 5 piglets from an F sow and 5 from a C sow. During <e>lactation</e>, sows were offered F or C food, resulting in FF, CF, FC and CC piglets. Piglets were weaned on day 25 and were given both control and flavored food for two weeks using a double food choice approach. The flavored food was not preferred. Yet, prenatally exposed animals showed a higher food intake and a higher body weight in the first days after weaning, and a lower occurrence of diarrhoea than non-exposed piglets. Prenatal exposure also increased the latency to fight, and reduced oral manipulation of pen mates and mounting during the first two weeks after weaning. Prenatal exposure, but not postnatal exposure alone, to anisic flavor through the maternal diet reduced weaning-associated problems in piglets and enhanced their health and welfare in the period after weaning.",M1
20131087,"Epigenetic regulation of milk production in dairy cows.It is well established that milk production of the dairy cow is a function of mammary epithelial cell (MEC) number and activity and that these factors can be influenced by diverse environmental influences and management practises (nutrition, milk frequency, photoperiod, udder health, hormonal and local effectors). Thus, understanding how the mammary gland is able to respond to these environmental cues provides a huge potential to enhance milk production of the dairy cow. In recent years our understanding of molecular events within the MEC underlying bovine <e>lactation</e> has been advanced through mammary microarray studies and will be further advanced through the recent availability of the bovine genome sequence. In addition, the potential of epigenetic regulation (non-sequence inheritable chemical changes in chromatin, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, which affect gene expression) to manipulate mammary function is emerging. We propose that a substantial proportion of unexplained phenotypic variation in the dairy cow is due to epigenetic regulation. Heritability of epigenetic marks also highlights the potential to modify lactation performance of offspring. Understanding the response of the MEC (cell signaling pathways and epigenetic mechanisms) to external stimuli will be an important prerequisite to devising new technologies for maximising their activity and, hence, milk production in the dairy cow.",M1
20122984,"Effect of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid on milk transfer to the litter and prolactin release in lactating rats.The effects of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) on brain monoamines and the serum level of hormones involved in milk synthesis and on the milk ejection reflex in rats were evaluated. Dams were treated with 2.5, 5, 15, 25, 50 or 70mg 2,4-D/kg bw according to two experimental designs: (a) through food from post partum day 1 (PPD 1) to PPD 16 and the respective control groups or (b) an unique i.p. injection on PPD 11. To measure milk ejection, the litter was separated from the mother at the 11th day of <e>lactation</e> during 8h, returned to their mothers and allowed to suckle for a period of 15min. The procedure was repeated on 3 consecutive days until the end of treatment. The change in litter weight during the suckling period was taken as a measure of the amount of milk ejected during this period. The dams' serum prolactin (PRL), oxytocin (OT) and growth hormone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Both treatment regimens produced a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of milk ejected and circulating PRL and OT secreted in response to the suckling stimulus. Administration of OT before returning the pups restored the milk ejection, indicating no impairment in the capacity of the mammary gland to produce and secrete milk. In addition, dopamine levels were increased by the 2,4-D treatments in arcuate nucleus (ArN) and anterior lobe of pituitary gland (AL), while serotonin level was drastically decreased in ArN. 2,4-D treatment increased both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities in ArN. These results suggest that 2,4-D inhibits the suckling-induced hormone release, milk transfer to the litter at the central level, through a stimulation of hypothalamic NOS and dopamine and by an inhibition of hypothalamic serotonin transmission.",M1
20118625,"Lack of modifying effects of prepubertal exposure to acrylamide (AA) on N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced multi-organ carcinogenesis in F344 rats.Acrylamide (AA) has been reported to be formed in fried and baked foods with various concentrations, and exposure levels to AA from cooked foods in children are estimated to be higher than those in adults. In order to evaluate the carcinogenicity of AA exposure during childhood, we conducted a medium-term carcinogenicity study with prepubertal administration of AA followed by treatments of a multi-organ-targeted genotoxic carcinogen and a promoting agent for thyroid carcinogenesis in rats. A total of 36 postpartum F344 rats were given drinking water containing AA at 0, 20, 40 or 80 ppm for 3 weeks during the <e>lactation</e> period, and their weaned offspring received the same AA-containing water for 3 more weeks. Offspring were then injected with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU; 40 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) once at week 7 after birth. Half the animals of the 0 and 40 ppm groups were additionally treated with the anti-thyroid agent sulfadimethoxine (SDM; 125 ppm) in the drinking water thereafter. Offspring were subjected to complete necropsy at week 50. All the major organs and macroscopic abnormalities were excised and examined histopathologically. There was no significant difference in the incidences of hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions in the target organs of AA and/or MNU, such as the brain, spinal cord, pituitary gland, thyroid, adrenal glands, uterus, mammary glands, clitoral gland and tunica vaginalis. In conclusion, no significant modifying actions of AA on MNU-induced multi-organ carcinogenesis were exhibited in any organs of rats when exposed prepubertally under the present experimental conditions.",M1
20116112,"White-line disease and haemorrhages in hooves of Finnish dairy cattle.The Finnish Healthy Hooves Project was set up to determine the frequency of, and risk factors for, various hoof lesions in Finnish dairy herds. Data were collected in 2003 and 2004. A large data set of &gt;74,000 cow-level observations recorded by hoof-trimmers were merged with production data from the Finnish Agricultural Data Processing Centre Ltd. Ultimately, data from a single <e>lactation</e> from each of 16,727 cows in 703 herds were used for analyses of white-line disease (WLD) and haemorrhages-lesions. Three-level hierarchical logistic models with hoof-trimmer and farms (within hoof-trimmer) as random-effects were fit to datasets of tie-stall (TS) and loose-housing (LH) herds separately. Cows examined once had a WLD risk of 4.8% in TS herds and 17% in LH herds. As the number of examinations increased, the odds of a WLD diagnosis increased substantially; (2 and 3+ examinations had odds ratios (ORs) of 2.57 and 3.40 in TS herds and 2.32 and 4.67 in LH herds, respectively, compared to 1 examination). Parity had an interaction with breed in all models in TS and in the LH haemorrhages model, but not in WLD LH models. In TS herds, older Holstein cows had a very high risk of WLD compared to young Ayrshire cows (OR=7.92). Also in LH herds both breed and parity had association with WLD (Holstein cows were 1.57 times more likely than Ayrshire cows and cows in parity &gt;or=4 were more likely (OR=2.89) than parity 1 to get WLD). In TS herds, other hoof lesions - such as haemorrhages (OR=1.65), heel-horn erosions (OR=1.77), and corkscrew claw (OR=1.82) - increased the risk of WLD. In LH herds, corkscrew claw (OR=1.59) and heel-horn erosion (OR=0.72) had a significant association with WLD. In TS herds, use of mats (compared to hard flooring) significantly reduced the risk of WLD and haemorrhages (OR=0.57 and OR=0.80, respectively). No significant associations of the 305-day milk production on the risk of either disease were observed in either TS or LH herds (305-day milk yield from each cows' previous lactation were used for calculations, with herd average yield and the individual cow's deviation from the herd average being used as predictors).",M1
20105550,"Estimation of genetic parameters for milk yield in Murrah buffaloes by Bayesian inference.Random regression models were used to estimate genetic parameters for test-day milk yield in Murrah buffaloes using Bayesian inference. Data comprised 17,935 test-day milk records from 1,433 buffaloes. Twelve models were tested using different combinations of third-, fourth-, fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-order orthogonal polynomials of weeks of <e>lactation</e> for additive genetic and permanent environmental effects. All models included the fixed effects of contemporary group, number of daily milkings and age of cow at calving as covariate (linear and quadratic effect). In addition, residual variances were considered to be heterogeneous with 6 classes of variance. Models were selected based on the residual mean square error, weighted average of residual variance estimates, and estimates of variance components, heritabilities, correlations, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions. Results indicated that changes in the order of fit for additive genetic and permanent environmental random effects influenced the estimation of genetic parameters. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.19 to 0.31. Genetic correlation estimates were close to unity between adjacent test-day records, but decreased gradually as the interval between test-days increased. Results from mean squared error and weighted averages of residual variance estimates suggested that a model considering sixth- and seventh-order Legendre polynomials for additive and permanent environmental effects, respectively, and 6 classes for residual variances, provided the best fit. Nevertheless, this model presented the largest degree of complexity. A more parsimonious model, with fourth- and sixth-order polynomials, respectively, for these same effects, yielded very similar genetic parameter estimates. Therefore, this last model is recommended for routine applications.",M1

Thirty-six multiparous Holstein cows (51+/-22 DIM and 643+/-49kg of body weight at trial initiation) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments in a completely randomized design: a 3-wk covariate adjustment period during which the cows were fed the normal-starch diet, followed by a 12-wk treatment period during which the cows were fed their assigned treatment diets. The normal-starch TMR did not contain exogenous amylase (NS-). The reduced-starch diets, formulated by partially replacing corn grain with soy hulls, were fed without (RS-) and with (RS+) exogenous amylase added to the TMR. Starch and NDF concentrations averaged 27.1 and 30.6%, 21.8 and 36.6%, and 20.7 and 36.6% (dry matter basis) for the NS-, RS-, and RS+ diets, respectively. Dry matter intake for cows fed the RS- diet was 2.4 and 3.2kg/d greater than for cows fed the NS- and RS+ diets, respectively. Intake of NDF ranged from 1.19 to 1.52% of body weight among the treatments, with the RS- diet being 28% greater than the NS- diet and 13% greater than the RS+ diet. Milk yield averaged 50.4kg/d and was unaffected by treatment. Fat-corrected milk yield was 2.9kg/d greater for cows fed the RS- diet than for cows fed the NS- diet. Body weight and body condition score measurements were unaffected by treatment. Fat-, solids-, and energy-corrected milk feed conversions (kilograms/kilogram of DMI) were 12 to 13% greater for cows fed the RS+ diet than for cows fed the RS- diet. Dry matter and nutrient digestibilities were lowest for cows fed the NS- diet and greatest for cows fed the RS+ diet, and were greater for cows fed the RS+ diet than for cows fed the RS- diet, with the exception of starch digestibility, which was similar. Greater conversion of feed to milk for dairy cows fed reduced-starch diets that include exogenous amylase may offer potential for improving economic performance.",M1
20105528,"Effects of increased milking frequency on metabolism and mammary cell proliferation in Holstein dairy cows.Results of previous studies have shown that increased milking frequency (IMF) during early <e>lactation</e> results in increased milk yield not only during the period of IMF but also after cows have returned to a decreased milking frequency. The cellular mechanisms underpinning this increased milk yield and the overall effects of IMF on metabolism have not been well characterized. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of IMF on metabolism and mammary epithelial cell proliferation in dairy cows. Thirty primiparous and 30 multiparous Holstein cows were assigned randomly at calving to 1 of 2 treatments. The control group was milked twice daily (2x) for 119 d, whereas the IMF group was milked 4 times daily (4x) from d 2 postcalving until d 21 and then 2x from d 22 until d 119. Overall milk yield did not differ between treatments throughout the 119 d monitored; however, the interaction of treatment by week was significant in that IMF cows yielded 4.8kg/d more milk than control cows during wk 2 and 3 and had similar levels of milk yield during the remainder of the study period. Reanalysis of data excluding data from cows subjected to mammary biopsy suggested that the mammary biopsy procedure contributed to the lack of overall responses of milk yield, but that responses overall to IMF were greater in primiparous cows compared with multiparous cows. Plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were elevated in multiparous cows subjected to IMF during the period of IMF, but were not influenced by treatment in primiparous cows. Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were not affected by treatment. Mammary tissue was collected by biopsy in a subset of cows (n=8 cows per parity and treatment) at calving and at d 21 and 75 postpartum and used for immunohistochemical localization of the cell proliferation antigen, Ki67. Effects of treatment on mammary epithelial cell proliferation were not significant, suggesting that other mechanisms must be responsible for carryover effects of IMF on lactational performance.",M1
20105527,"Effect of milking frequency on <e>lactation</e> persistency and mammary gland remodeling in mid-lactation cows.The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of milking frequency on milk production and composition, mammary cell proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression. For this investigation, 10 Holstein cows that were being milked twice a day in mid lactation were selected. To study the effect of differential milking, 2 quarters were milked once daily and the other 2 were milked thrice daily for 8wk. After that period, twice-daily milking was resumed for all quarters, and data were collected for an additional 6wk. Mammary gland biopsies were taken 1wk before differential milking (wk -1) and after 4 and 8wk of differential milking. Milk samples were collected weekly throughout the experiment. Once-daily milking resulted in an immediate reduction in milk yield, whereas thrice-daily milking resulted in an increase in milk yield. During differential milking, the daily milk yield of the quarters milked once daily declined by 0.54kg/wk, on average, but remained constant in the quarters milked thrice daily. Part of the difference in milk yield between the glands pairs persisted after twice-daily milking was reinitiated. In the quarters milked once daily, milk BSA concentration increased, indicating an increase in tight junction leakiness, and zymographic analysis of milk enzymes showed increased activity of several proteases. Reducing the milking frequency also increased mammary cell apoptosis and, surprisingly, mammary cell proliferation. Interestingly, milk concentrations of stanniocalcin-1 and insulin-like growth factor-I and mammary gland expression of several genes were also modulated by milking frequency. For example, expression of insulin-like growth factor I receptor was downregulated during once-daily milking. Last, expression of the short and long isoforms of the prolactin receptor and of CSN2 (beta-casein) were upregulated during thrice-daily milking. Taken together, these data suggest that milking frequency not only affects mammary gland remodeling and the expression of paracrine factors but also modulates hormone sensitivity.",M1
20105524,"Short communication: the effect of dry period duration and dietary energy density in early <e>lactation</e> on the rennet gelation properties of milk.This study was carried out to examine the effects of decreasing the dry period (DP) duration and altering the energy density of the diet during early lactation on the rheological characteristics of milk. Forty mature Holstein-Friesian cows were used in a completely randomized design with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dry period treatments and 1 of 2 nutritional treatments. The DP treatments were continuous milking (CM) or an 8-wk standard dry period (SDP), and the nutritional treatments were a standard energy diet (SE) or a high energy diet (HE). Actual DP lengths were 6.3+/-1.7 d and 62.1+/-1.9 d for cows on the CM and SDP treatments, respectively. Milk samples were collected at 2, 6, and 10 wk postpartum. The concentrations of fat, protein, and lactose were determined in each sample. The rennet gelation properties were measured at 31 degrees C using dynamic low-amplitude strain oscillatory rheometry. The following parameters were obtained from the resultant elastic shear modulus (G'): gelation time, maximum curd firming rate, and gel strength. Reducing the DP duration from 62 to 6 d resulted in increases in milk protein concentration (31.8 vs. 34.7 g/kg), maximum curd firming rate (2.58 vs. 3.60 Pa/min), and gel strength (69.4 vs. 90.5Pa). Increasing the dietary energy density decreased percentage milk fat (43.1 vs. 37.7 g/kg) but otherwise had no effect. Gel strength was correlated with maximum curd firming rate (r=0.99), and both variables were correlated with milk protein concentration (r=0.71 and r=0.73, respectively). The results indicate that decreasing the duration of the DP increased milk protein concentration and improved the rennet gelation properties of milk, but that dietary energy density had little effect.",M1
20101390,"Effect of cocaine sensitization prior to pregnancy on maternal care and aggression in the rat.RATIONALE: Although many studies have investigated the effects of gestational and lactational cocaine use on maternal behavior, few studies have examined the effects of prior adult cocaine use on maternal behavior. METHODS: In the current study, intraperitoneal cocaine or saline was administered to adult female rats for 10 days, treatments were stopped for 4 days, and the females were then mated. Litter size and weight were recorded on days 2 and 16 of <e>lactation</e>, and maternal care, maternal aggression, and light/dark box activity were assessed on days 2, 9, and 16 of lactation. RESULTS: The cocaine-treated females exhibited behavioral sensitization on treatment day 10. Mothers previously treated with cocaine retrieved pups more quickly, spent more time caring for the pups (increased pup retrieval, pup grooming, and crouching over the pups by the mother), and were more aggressive towards a male intruder compared to saline-treated control animals on day 2 of lactation. These effects were specific to maternal behavior, as other behaviors were mostly unaffected by prior cocaine treatment. Data from light/dark box tests indicate that cocaine did not affect activity in this test. There were few significant behavioral effects of prior cocaine treatment on lactation days 9 and 16. CONCLUSIONS: Prior cocaine use may have lasting effects on offspring care and maternal aggression, specifically during early lactation. The present data support the hypothesis that maternal behavior is increased by prior cocaine sensitization, possibly due to cross-sensitization between cocaine and the natural reward of maternal behavior.",M1
20097510,"Plasma ghrelin and oxyntomodulin concentrations in lactating dairy cows receiving abomasal soybean oil, corn starch, and casein infusions.The effects of increased postruminal supply of casein, corn starch, and soybean oil on plasma concentrations of the gastrointestinal hormones ghrelin and oxyntomodulin (OXM) were investigated. Four mid-<e>lactation</e> Holstein cows were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square. Treatments were continuous abomasal infusions (23 h/d) for 7 d of water, soybean oil (500 g/d), corn starch (1100 g/d), or casein (800 g/d). Jugular vein plasma was obtained every 30 min for 7h on days 1 and 7. Soybean oil and casein infusion decreased preprandial plasma ghrelin concentration by approximately 20% on both d (time-by-treatment P&lt;0.10); however, dry matter intake (DMI) was depressed only after 7 d of oil infusion. Infusion of soybean oil, corn starch, or casein did not change the plasma OXM concentration (P&gt;0.20). The present data indicate that plasma ghrelin concentration is depressed immediately before feeding by the postruminal infusion of soybean oil and casein, but it is not affected during the postprandial period. Plasma ghrelin concentration was not altered (P&gt;0.20), pre- or postfeeding, by increased postruminal supply of corn starch. In addition, plasma OXM concentration did not respond (P&gt;0.20) to postruminal nutrient infusion. In conclusion, a decrease in DMI when fat is infused could be partially explained by the decrease in prefeeding plasma ghrelin concentration, but a decrease in prefeeding plasma ghrelin concentration is not always associated with a decrease in DMI, as observed for the infusion of casein. Plasma OXM concentration was not affected by postruminal infusion of macronutrients.",M1
20091884,"Effect of maternal protein restriction during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> on the number of cardiomyocytes in the postproliferative weanling rat heart.Maternal protein restriction leads to a reduction in the number of cardiomyocytes in the rat heart at birth. However, in rats, cardiomyocytes continue to proliferate until about 2 weeks after birth. Hence, this study aimed to examine the effect of maternal protein restriction, on the number of cardiomyocytes in the young rat heart at a time point when the cardiomyocytes have ceased proliferating and are terminally differentiated. Female Wistar Kyoto rats were fed either a normal protein diet (NPD; 20% casein) or a low protein diet (LPD; 8.7% casein) during pregnancy and lactation. Offspring (seven males and seven females per group) were perfusion fixed at 4 weeks of age. Heart volume and total cardiomyocyte number were determined using stereological techniques. At 4 weeks of age, body weights in both male and female LPD offspring were significantly reduced compared with NPD controls whereas relative heart volumes were significantly increased in LPD offspring. Total number of cardiomyocytes was not significantly different between groups. In both groups, there was a significant linear correlation between cardiomyocyte number and heart volume. In conclusion, total cardiomyocyte number in the postproliferative rat heart does not appear to be affected by maternal protein restriction per se but is directly related to heart size.",M1
20090312,"Effects of dietary folic acid on the expression of myelin basic protein in the brain and spinal cord of pregnant and lactating rats.Background/Aims: This study investigated the effects of dietary folic acid on the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the maternal brain and spinal cord during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e>. Methods: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a folic-acid-supplemented diet (FS, 8 mg/kg diet) or a folic-acid-deficient diet (FD, 0 mg/kg diet) from 2 weeks prior to mating until the end of lactation. The expressions of MBP were analyzed using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and neuronal nuclear antigen by immunohistochemistry. Results: The cerebrocortical expression of MBP was 87% higher at day 20 of pregnancy than before pregnancy in FS animals (p &lt; 0.05) but did not change significantly in FD animals. No significant change was observed in the hippocampus or spinal cord in either dietary treatment group. The cerebrocortical MOG and NeuN expressions were significantly lower in FD animals than in FS animals before pregnancy and increased at day 20 of pregnancy but did not differ with the dietary folic acid level. Conclusions: Folic acid deficiency did not increase the expression level of MBP in the cerebral cortex during pregnancy, suggesting that folate intake during pregnancy plays an important role in the maintenance of myelin.",M1
20090123,"Modulation of macronutrient metabolism in the offspring by maternal micronutrient deficiency in experimental animals.Epidemiological evidence indicates that poor early growth is associated with increased susceptibility to visceral obesity, insulin resistance and associated diseases in adulthood. Studies in experimental animals have demonstrated a robust association between nutrient imbalance during foetal life and disease prevalence in their later life specially of those involving macronutrient metabolism. There is very little data on the role of maternal micronutrient deficiencies widely prevalent in India. This review focuses on different animal models of micronutrient restriction, mimicking human situations during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> that cause aberrations in macronutrient metabolism in the offspring. These aberrations consist of altered body composition, dyslipidaemia and altered insulin sensitivity associated with modulated insulin production. These phenotypic changes were associated with altered lipid profile, fatty acid synthesis / transport, oxidative stress, glucose tolerance / tissue uptake. Further, these were also associated with altered myogenesis and insulin expression and secretion from pancreatic beta-islets. While these changes during in utero or early postnatal life serve as essential adaptations to overcome adverse conditions, these become maladaptive subsequently and set the stage for obesity and type 2 diabetes.",M1
20086320,"Exposure to dams' low-fat high-carbohydrate diet during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> establishes a preference for fat by their offspring.To investigate the causes why pups of dams fed a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet (LFD) showed strong preference for fat, two groups of pregnant rats were fed either the LFD or the control-diet (CTD) during pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, pups in both groups were divided into two groups. Two groups were offered a self-selection regimen of either a carbohydrate-protein diet (CPD) or a fat-protein diet (FPD) (the LFD-CF and the CTD-CF groups) and the remaining groups were fed the same diet as their dams (the LFD and the CTD groups) for 5 wk. Although the body weight of pups fed the LFD was lower than that of pups fed the CTD, the body weight of the LFD-CF group caught up with that of the CTD group. The ratio of FPD intake [FPD intake (g)/total intake (g)] by the LFD-CF group was higher than that of the CTD-CF group. In both dams and their pups, although no significant difference in the plasma glucose concentration was observed between the LFD and the CTD groups, the plasma insulin and triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations of the LFD group were higher than those of the CTD group. However, the self-selection diet appeared to prevent an increase in the plasma insulin and TG concentrations. Therefore, it was supposed that although pups of dams fed the LFD showed strong preference for fat in order to achieve optimal growth, the dietary selection pattern after weaning was associated with the depletion in plasma insulin.",M1
20075866,"PIKE-A is required for prolactin-mediated STAT5a activation in mammary gland development.PI 3-kinase enhancer A (PIKE-A) is critical for the activation of Akt signalling, and has an essential function in promoting cancer cell survival. However, its physiological functions are poorly understood. Here, we show that PIKE-A directly associates with both signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a (STAT5a) and prolactin (PRL) receptor, which is essential for PRL-provoked STAT5a activation and the subsequent gene transcription. Depletion of PIKE-A in HC11 epithelial cells diminished PRL-induced STAT5 activation and cyclin D1 expression, resulting in profoundly impaired cell proliferation in vitro. To confirm the function of PIKE-A in PRL signalling in vivo, we generated PIKE knockout (PIKE-/-) mice. PIKE-/- mice displayed a severe <e>lactation</e> defect that was characterized by enhanced apoptosis and impaired proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. At parturition, STAT5 activation and cyclin D1 expression were substantially reduced in the mammary epithelium of PIKE-/- mice. The defective mammary gland development in PIKE-/- mice was rescued by overexpression of a mammary-specific cyclin D1 transgene. These data establish a critical function for PIKE-A in mediating PRL functions.",M1
20074369,"Characterization of the Six1 homeobox gene in normal mammary gland morphogenesis.BACKGROUND: The Six1 homeobox gene is highly expressed in the embryonic mammary gland, continues to be expressed in early postnatal mammary development, but is lost when the mammary gland differentiates during pregnancy. However, Six1 is re-expressed in breast cancers, suggesting that its re-instatement in the adult mammary gland may contribute to breast tumorigenesis via initiating a developmental process out of context. Indeed, recent studies demonstrate that Six1 overexpression in the adult mouse mammary gland is sufficient for initiating invasive carcinomas, and that its overexpression in xenograft models of mammary cancer leads to metastasis. These data demonstrate that Six1 is causally involved in both breast tumorigenesis and metastasis, thus raising the possibility that it may be a viable therapeutic target. However, because Six1 is highly expressed in the developing mammary gland, and because it has been implicated in the expansion of mammary stem cells, targeting Six1 as an anti-cancer therapy may have unwanted side effects in the breast. RESULTS: We sought to determine the role of Six1 in mammary development using two independent mouse models. To study the effect of Six1 loss in early mammary development when Six1 is normally expressed, Six1-/- embryonic mammary glands were transplanted into Rag1-/- mice. In addition, to determine whether Six1 downregulation is required during later stages of development to allow for proper differentiation, we overexpressed Six1 during adulthood using an inducible, mammary-specific transgenic mouse model. Morphogenesis of the mammary gland occurred normally in animals transplanted with Six1-/- embryonic mammary glands, likely through the redundant functions of other Six family members such as Six2 and Six4, whose expression was increased in response to Six1 loss. Surprisingly, inappropriate expression of Six1 in the adult mammary gland, when levels are normally low to absent, did not inhibit normal mammary differentiation during pregnancy or <e>lactation</e>. CONCLUSIONS: Six1 is not critical for normal mammary gland development, since neither loss nor inappropriate overexpression of Six1 adversely affects normal mammary gland development or function. However, as both Six2 and Six4 levels are increased in Six1-/- mammary glands, we postulate that these Six family members are functionally redundant in the gland, as is true of many homeobox gene families. This data, in conjunction with recent findings that Six1 is capable of promoting breast cancer initiation and progression, suggest that Six1 may serve as a reasonable chemotherapeutic target in a clinical setting, particularly for those women diagnosed with breast cancer in their childbearing years.",M1
20068006,"Moderate caloric restriction in lactating rats protects offspring against obesity and insulin resistance in later life.We aimed to assess the lasting effects of caloric restriction in lactating rats on body weight and insulin sensitivity of their offspring. Dams were fed with either ad libitum standard diet or a 30% caloric restricted diet throughout <e>lactation</e>. After weaning, the offspring were fed with a normal-fat diet until the age of 15 wk, and then with a normal- or a high-fat (HF) diet until the age of 26 wk. Blood parameters were measured during ad libitum feeding conditions and after 14-h fasting. Food preferences were also measured. In dams, milk leptin concentration and leptin mRNA and protein levels in mammary gland were also determined. Caloric restricted dams showed higher mRNA and protein levels of leptin in mammary gland than controls, without significant changes in milk leptin concentration. The offspring of caloric restricted dams (CR) ate fewer calories and showed lower body weight gain and fat accumulation under the HF diet than their controls. CR also maintained unchanged circulating leptin levels under HF diet, whereas levels increased in controls. In addition, male CR were resistant to the increase of circulating triglycerides and of the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance produced in male controls under HF diet feeding; CR were also protected against the increased preference for fat-food occurring in females upon HF diet. These results suggest moderate caloric restriction during lactation protects from obesity development in offspring in adult life and from the related metabolic alterations, particularly dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hyperleptinemia, associated with HF diet feeding.",M1
20059939,"Manure nutrient excretion by Jersey and Holstein cows.The objective of this study was to evaluate feces, urine, and N excretion by Jersey and Holstein cows. Sixteen multiparous cows (n=8 per breed) were fed 2 experimental rations at calving in a switchback experimental design. Diets were 50% forage and based on corn meal (control) or whole cottonseed. Half the cows in each breed started on the control diet and half started on the whole cottonseed diet. Cows were switched to the other diet at 60 d in milk and switched back to their original diet at 165 d in milk. Pairs of cows were moved into open-circuit respiration chambers on d 49, 154, and 271 of <e>lactation</e> for 7-d measurement periods. While in the chambers, total collection of feed refusals, milk, recovered hair, feces, and urine was conducted. No effect of the interaction of diet and breed was observed for measures of nutrient digestibility and manure excretion. Total daily manure excretion was lower in Jersey cows than in Holstein cows, with reductions generally proportional to changes in feed intake. Jersey cows consumed 29% less feed and excreted 33% less wet feces and 28% less urine than Holstein cows. Intake, fecal, and urinary N were reduced by 29, 33, and 24%, respectively, in Jersey cows compared with Holstein cows. Equations from American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers underpredicted observed values for all manure measures evaluated (urine, manure solids, N, wet manure), and breed bias was observed in equations predicting excretion of urine, N, and wet manure. Although these equations include animal and dietary factors, intercepts of regression of observed values on predicted values differed between Holsteins and Jerseys for those 3 measures. No breed bias was observed in the prediction of manure solids excretion, however, making that equation equally appropriate for Jerseys and Holsteins. The effect of breed on manure and nutrient excretion has significant nutrient management implications.",M1
20059934,"Economic values and expected effect of selection index for pathogen-specific mastitis under Danish conditions.The objectives of this study were 1) to estimate costs related to 5 different pathogen-specific mastitis traits (susceptibility to different pathogens causing mastitis in dairy cattle) and unspecific mastitis, and 2) to compare selection differentials for an udder health index consisting of 5 different pathogen-specific mastitis traits and <e>lactation</e> average somatic cell count from 5 to 170 d after first calving (LASCC170) with another index consisting of 1 unspecific mastitis trait and LASCC170. Economic values were estimated for mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Streptococcus uberis using a stochastic simulation model (SimHerd IV). Mastitis incidences for SimHerd IV were from incidences of mastitis treatments in primiparous Danish Holstein cows calving in 2007. Estimated costs ranged from 149 euro to 570 euro per mastitis case and were highest for contagious pathogens such as Staph. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and lowest for Strep. dysgalactiae and Strep. uberis. The value for unspecific mastitis was 231 euro per case. Selection differentials (in euro) were estimated for 4 different selection indices, including 1) unspecific mastitis, 2) unspecific mastitis and LASCC170, 3) 5 pathogen-specific mastitis traits and unspecific residual mastitis (unspecific mastitis treatments minus mastitis treatments caused by the 5 pathogens), and 4) as index 3 including LASCC170. The breeding goal was identical to selection index 3. Mastitis data from primiparous cows calving from 1998 to 2008 were used to estimate genetic parameters of the mastitis traits using linear models and AI-REML algorithm. These parameters were used for construction of the selection index equations. For the selection indices, information sources were measurements of mastitis treatments and LASCC170 from 50, 80, or 130 daughters of a bull as well as measurements of mastitis treatments from 1,000 progeny of the bull's sire and 1,000 daughters of his maternal grandsire. Differences in selection differentials were marginal among the 4 indices. Without considering LASCC170, the selection differential of an unspecific mastitis index was 0.4 euro (&lt;1%) better than that of a pathogen-specific index. On the other hand, the selection differential of the pathogen-specific index was 0.3 euro (&lt;1%) better than that of an unspecific index when LASCC170 was included in the indices. Reliabilities of the selection indices were 0.62 to 0.67 (80 daughters) and were proportional to the selection differential. Changing the number of daughters to 50 or 130 did not change ranking of the indices. Heritabilities of the pathogen-specific traits were very low (h(2)=0.005-0.021) compared with unspecific mastitis (h(2)=0.062), which may limit the selection differential of the pathogen-specific index.",M1
20059929,"Carbohydrate source and protein degradability alter <e>lactation</e>, ruminal, and blood measures.Thirty-eight lactating dairy cows including 6 ruminally cannulated cows were used in a feeding study to assess effects of feed sources that differed in dietary nonfiber carbohydrate (NFC) composition and ruminal degradability of dietary protein (RDP) on production, ruminal, and plasma measures. The design was a partially balanced, incomplete Latin square with three 21-d periods and a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Samples and data were collected in the last 7 d of each period. Feed sources that differed in NFC profile were dry ground corn (GC; starch), dried citrus pulp (DCP; sugar and pectins), and sucrose+molasses (SM; sugar). Dietary RDP was altered by providing CP with soybean meal (+RDP) or substituting a heat-treated expeller soybean product for a portion of the soybean meal (-RDP). Diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous and similar in NFC concentration. Cows consuming GC had the greatest milk urea nitrogen and milk protein percentage and yield, tended to have the greatest dry matter intake, but had a lesser milk fat percentage compared with cows consuming DCP and SM. Sucrose+molasses diets supported greater dry matter intake, milk protein yield, and 3.5% fat- and protein-corrected milk yield than did DCP diets. On -RDP diets, milk protein percentage was less and milk urea nitrogen and protein yield tended to be less than for +RDP diets. Dry ground corn diverged from DCP and SM in the effect of NFC x RDP, with cows consuming GC having lesser milk yield, 3.5% fat- and protein-corrected milk yield, and efficiency with -RDP as compared with +RDP, whereas these production measures were greater with -RDP than +RDP for cows consuming DCP and SM. In contrast, in situ NDF digestibility at 30h for GC and SM was greater for -RDP as compared with +RDP, but the reverse was true for DCP. The lowest ruminal pH detected by 6h postfeeding was also influenced by the interaction of NFC x RDP, with cows consuming SM having a lower pH with +RDP than with -RDP and cows consuming DCP having a similar pH on either RDP treatment. Total rumen volatile fatty acid concentrations did not differ among diets, but acetate molar percent was greater for DCP than for SM, and GC had the lowest molar percent for butyrate and valerate and greatest branched-chain volatile fatty acid concentration. Valerate molar percent and NH(3) concentration tended to be greater with +RDP than with -RDP. Plasma glucose and insulin were both greater in cows receiving SM than in those receiving DCP. Protein degradability, NFC source, and their interactions affected lactation, ruminal, and blood measures, suggesting that these dietary factors warrant further consideration in diet formulation.",M1
20059927,"<e>Lactation</e> performance and amino acid utilization of cows fed increasing amounts of reduced-fat dried distillers grains with solubles.The use of a solvent-extraction process that removes corn oil from distillers grains produces a reduced-fat co-product (RFDG). To determine the optimal concentration of RFDG in mid-lactation diets, 22 multiparous and 19 primiparous Holstein cows were used in a completely randomized design for 8 wk, including a 2-wk covariate period. The RFDG was included at 0, 10, 20, and 30% of the diet on a dry matter basis, replacing soybean feedstuffs. Increasing RFDG in diets had no effect on dry matter intake (23.1 kg/d) or milk production (35.0 kg/d). Milk fat percentage increased linearly from 3.18 to 3.72% as RFDG increased from 0 to 30% of the diet. Similarly, milk fat yield tended to increase linearly from 1.08 to 1.32 kg/d. Milk protein percentage (2.99, 3.06, 3.13, and 2.99% for diets with RFDG from 0 to 30%) responded quadratically, whereas protein yield was not affected by treatment. Milk urea N decreased linearly from 15.8 to 13.1mg/dL. The efficiency of N utilization for milk production was not affected by including RFDG (26.1%), whereas the efficiency of milk production (energy-corrected milk divided by dry matter intake) tended to increase linearly with increasing RFDG in the diet. Similarly, concentrations of plasma glucose increased linearly. Arterial Lys decreased linearly from 66.0 to 44.8 microM/L, whereas arterial Met increased linearly from 16.5 to 29.3 microM/L. Arteriovenous difference of Lys decreased linearly from 42.6 to 32.5 microM/L, whereas that of Met was unaffected. The extraction of Lys by the mammary gland increased linearly from 64.3 to 72.2%, whereas that of Met decreased linearly from 71.6 to 42.7%. Feeding up to 30% of RFDG in a mid-lactation diet supported lactation performance similarly to cows fed the soybean protein-based diet (0% RFDG).",M1
20059920,"Therapeutic effects of antimicrobial treatment during <e>lactation</e> of recently acquired bovine subclinical mastitis: two linked randomized field trials.Two linked randomized field trials were performed on 39 herds in the Netherlands to 1) determine therapeutic effects of antimicrobial treatment of recently acquired subclinical mastitis (RASCM) during lactation, 2) evaluate the effect of duration of subclinical mastitis on therapeutic outcome, and 3) identify factors related to the therapeutic success of RASCM. Cows with a first elevated composite somatic cell count (CSCC) after 2 consecutive low CSCC measurements were eligible for enrollment in trial 1 (treatment at the first elevated CSCC). Quarter milk samples were collected to determine bacteriological status for major pathogens and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Cows with one or more culture-positive quarters with a quarter somatic cell count (QSCC) &gt;or=100,000 cells/mL were defined to have RASCM and were randomly assigned treatment or control (no treatment). Untreated cows from trial 1 that had a second elevated CSCC at the next milk recording were eligible for enrollment in trial 2 (treatment at the second elevated CSCC). In trial 2, staphylococci-positive cows (Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci) were randomly assigned to treatment or control. Farmers used their own treatment protocols to treat quarters in both trials. Bacteriological cure was defined as absence of the pathogen identified pre-intervention in 2 samples post-intervention; QSCC, CSCC, and milk yield were also analyzed. Hierarchical logistic and linear models were used to determine therapeutic effects and to identify factors related to therapy outcome. Treated quarters had a higher bacteriological cure rate than control quarters for all pathogens in both trials. Treatment resulted in lower QSCC and CSCC, whereas milk yield was not affected by treatment. Bacteriological cure of RASCM was better in quarters with a low QSCC pre-intervention and in coagulase-negative staphylococci-positive quarters. Control quarters with a single culture-positive sample pre-intervention also had a higher bacteriological cure than control quarters with &gt;or=2 culture-positive samples. Time of antimicrobial treatment affected bacteriological cure for penicillin-sensitive Staph. aureus. Bacteriological cure tended to be higher for Staph. aureus after treatment at the first elevated CSCC compared with treatment at the second elevated CSCC. Thus, early treatment of Staph. aureus might be more effective than later treatment.",M1
20059919,"Continuous <e>lactation</e> effects on mammary remodeling during late gestation and lactation in dairy goats.The present study aimed to 1) elucidate whether continuous milking during late gestation in dairy goats negatively affects mammary remodeling and hence milk production in the subsequent lactation, and 2) identify the regulatory factors responsible for changes in cell turnover and angiogenesis in the continuously lactating mammary gland. Nine multiparous dairy goats were used. One udder half was dried off approximately 9 wk prepartum (normal lactation; NL), and the other udder half of the same goat was milked continuously (continuous lactation; CL) until parturition or until the half-udder milk yields had dropped to below 50 g/d. Mammary biopsies were obtained from each udder half just before the NL gland was dried off (before dry period), within the first 2 wk after drying-off (early dry period, samples available only for NL glands), in the mid dry period, within the last 2 wk before parturition (late dry period), and at d 1 (the day of parturition), 3, 10, 60, and 180 of lactation. Mammary morphology was characterized in biopsies by quantitative histology, and cell turnover was determined by immunohistochemistry (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and Ki-67). Transcription of genes encoding factors involved in mammary epithelial cell (MEC) turnover and vascular function was quantified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results demonstrated that omitting the dry period was possible in goats but was not as easy as claimed before. Renewal of MEC was suppressed in CL glands, which resulted in a smaller MEC population in the subsequent lactation. At the time of parturition (and throughout lactation), the mammary glands subjected to CL had smaller alveoli, more fully differentiated MEC, and a substantially larger capillary fraction compared with NL glands. The continuously lactating gland thus resembled a normally lactating gland in an advanced stage of lactation. None of the studied genomic factors could account for these treatment differences. The described characteristics in CL glands compared with NL glands indicated a gland maintained in lactation for a longer period.",M1
20059907,"Optimal replacement policies for dairy cows based on daily yield measurements.Markov decision processes (MDP) with finite state and action space have often been used to model sequential decision making over time in dairy herds. However, the length of each stage has been at least 1 mo, resulting in models that do not support decisions on a daily basis. The present paper describes the first step of developing an MDP model that can be integrated into a modern herd management system. A hierarchical MDP was formulated for the dairy cow replacement problem with stage lengths of 1 d. It can be used to assist the farmer in replacement decisions on a daily basis and is based on daily milk yield measurements that are available in modern milking systems. Bayesian updating was used to predict the performance of each cow in the herd and economic decisions were based on the prediction. Moreover, parameters in the model were estimated using data records of the specific herd under consideration. This includes herd-specific <e>lactation</e> curves.",M1
20059902,"Variability of mammary blood flow in lactating Holstein-Friesian cows during the first twelve weeks of <e>lactation</e>.The goals of the present study were to measure mammary blood flow volume (BFV) during the first 12 wk of lactation in dairy cows by using color Doppler sonography and to determine what affects the mammary blood flow. Forty cows were examined via color Doppler sonography on d 1, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 84 after parturition (d 0). The total BFV (BFV(total)) to the 4 mammary glands was calculated by measuring time-averaged maximum velocities (TAMV) and cross-sectional areas (A) of the left and right pudendoepigastric trunks via transrectal color Doppler sonography. Because there were no significant differences in A, TAMV, and BFV between the right and left pudendoepigastric trunks, the means of A and TAMV, and the BFV(total) of both trunks were used for calculations. The intraindividual and interindividual variability of repeated BFV measures quantified by intraclass correlation coefficients were 96 and 98%, respectively. The BFV(total) ranged from 19.9 to 27.9 L/min, with a mean of 22.3+/-4.9 L/min. Interindividual differences in BFV values were attributable to variations in A and TAMV. The interindividual variability of the BFV(total), which was determined using the coefficients of variation of the BFV(total) on individual days, ranged from 16 to 28%. All the cows had similar changes in the BFV(total) during the study. Changes in BFV(total) were not correlated with changes in the mean of A, but there was a good correlation between changes in BFV(total) and in the mean of TAMV (r=0.94). The BFV(total) was highest on d 1 of lactation, decreased 28% by d 7, and remained at this level until d 28. By d 56, the BFV(total) had increased by 15% compared with d 14 and by 10% compared with d 28. The BFV(total) on d 84 was significantly different from all other days except d 56. There were moderate correlations between daily milk yield and BFV on individual days (0.24&lt;r&lt;0.35). In conclusion, Doppler sonography is a reliable method for determining blood flow in the pudendoepigastric trunk of cows. There is great variability in mammary blood flow among cows and in BFV.",M1

Maternal obesity in A(y)-mice impaired glucose tolerance in adult Agouti-negative offspring. Changes of hormone pattern during pregnancy and lactation are known to disregulate glucose metabolism in the adult progeny. The aim of the study was to assay blood levels of glucose, insulin, corticosterone and leptin during pregnancy (days 7, 13, 18) and lactation (days 1, 10, 21) in C57B1/6J mice of a/a (normal metabolism) and A(y)/a genotypes. A(y)/a-mice did not differ from a/a-mice in insulin and glucose levels during pregnancy and lactation, in corticosterone levels during pregnancy, but had higher leptin levels in pregnancy and lactation and increased corticosterone levels during lactation. A(y)/a-mice may be considered as a genetic model for studying impact of maternal leptin and corticosterone in developmental programming.",M1
20055928,"Difference in ponderal growth and body composition among pregnant vs. never-pregnant adolescents varies by birth outcomes.Recently, we showed that following pregnancy and 6 months of <e>lactation</e>, adolescents cease linear growth and have reduced fat and lean mass in rural Bangladesh. Here, we examined whether these changes varied by pregnancy outcomes such as fetal loss, low birthweight (LBW) and neonatal mortality. Anthropometric measurements were taken among 12-19-year-old primigravidae (n = 229) in early pregnancy and at 6 months post-partum. Never-pregnant adolescents (n = 456) matched on age and time since menarche were also measured at the same time. Change in anthropometry among pregnant vs. never-pregnant adolescents was compared by pregnancy outcome adjusting for confounders using mixed effects regression models. Pregnant girls, irrespective of birth outcome, did not gain in stature, while never-pregnant girls increased in height by 0.36 +/- 0.04 cm year(-1) (P &lt; 0.05). Body mass index, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and % body fat among pregnant adolescents whose infants survived the neonatal period had decreased at 6 months post-partum, whereas those who experienced a fetal loss or neonatal death did not change in any of the measurements. Consequently, the difference in change in ponderal size and body composition measures between pregnant and never-pregnant girls was higher among those whose neonates survived vs. those who experienced a fetal loss/neonatal death (BMI: -0.64 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.01 +/- 0.16 kg m(-2) year(-1); MUAC: -0.96 +/- 0.12 vs. -0.35 +/- 0.17 cm year(-1), both P &lt; 0.05). LBW and preterm birth did not have a similar effect modification. Linear growth ceased among pregnant girls regardless of birth outcome. Maternal weight loss and depletion of fat and lean mass at 6 months post-partum were more pronounced when the infants survived through the neonatal period.",M1
20053350,"Effects of genistein in the maternal diet on reproductive development and spatial learning in male rats.Endocrine disruptors, chemicals that disturb the actions of endogenous hormones, have been implicated in birth defects associated with hormone-dependent development. Phytoestrogens are a class of endocrine disruptors found in plants. In the current study we examined the effects of exposure at various perinatal time periods to genistein, a soy phytoestrogen, on reproductive development and learning in male rats. Dams were fed genistein-containing (5 mg/kg feed) food during both gestation and <e>lactation</e>, during gestation only, during lactation only, or during neither period. Measures of reproductive development and body mass were taken in the male offspring during postnatal development, and learning and memory performance was assessed in adulthood. Genistein exposure via the maternal diet decreased body mass in the male offspring of dams fed genistein during both gestation and lactation, during lactation only, but not during gestation only. Genistein decreased anogenital distance when exposure was during both gestation and lactation, but there was no effect when exposure was limited to one of these time periods. Similarly, spatial learning in the Morris water maze was impaired in male rats exposed to genistein during both gestation and lactation, but not in rats exposed during only one of these time periods. There was no effect of genistein on cued or contextual fear conditioning. In summary, the data indicate that exposure to genistein through the maternal diet significantly impacts growth in male offspring if exposure is during lactation. The effects of genistein on reproductive development and spatial learning required exposure throughout the pre- and postnatal periods.",M1
20051486,"Pregnancy up-regulates intestinal calcium absorption and skeletal mineralization independently of the vitamin D receptor.Without the vitamin D receptor (VDR), adult mammals develop reduced intestinal calcium absorption, rickets, and osteomalacia. Intestinal calcium absorption normally increases during pregnancy so that the mother can supply sufficient calcium to her fetuses. The maternal skeleton is rapidly resorbed during <e>lactation</e> to provide calcium needed for milk; that lost bone mineral content (BMC) is completely restored after weaning. We studied Vdr null mice to determine whether these adaptations during pregnancy and lactation require the VDR. Vdr nulls were severely rachitic at 10 wk of age on a normal diet. Pregnancy induced a 158% increase in Vdr null BMC to equal the pregnant wild-type (WT) value. Lactation caused BMC losses that were equal in Vdr nulls and WT. Vdr nulls recovered after weaning to a BMC 50% higher than before pregnancy and equal to WT. Additional analyses showed that during pregnancy, duodenal (45)Ca absorption increased in Vdr nulls, secondary hyperparathyroidism lessened, bone turnover markers decreased, and osteoid became fully mineralized. A genome-wide microarray analysis of duodenal RNA found marked reduction of Trpv6 in Vdr nulls at baseline but a 13.5-fold increase during pregnancy. Calbindin D-9K (S100g) and Ca(2+)-ATPase (Pmca1) were not altered by pregnancy. Several other solute transporters increased during pregnancy in Vdr nulls. In summary, Vdr nulls adapt to pregnancy by up-regulating duodenal Trpv6 and intestinal (45)Ca absorption, thereby enabling rapid normalization of BMC during pregnancy. These mice lactate normally and fully restore BMC after weaning. Therefore, VDR is not required for the skeletal adaptations during pregnancy, lactation, and after weaning.",M1
20045447,"Mu and kappa opioid receptor expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus and effectiveness of selective antagonists on prolactin release during <e>lactation</e>.Endogenous opioid peptides are involved in prolactin release during lactation, in part by decreasing tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neuronal activity. Both mu (mu) and kappa (kappa) opioid receptors have a role in the suckling-induced prolactin rise after 4-5 h up deprivation. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of mu opioid receptor antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA), and kappa opioid receptor antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI), on prolactin secretion and TIDA neuronal activity in lactating rats after 18 h pup deprivation. After 4 h separation from pups, the suckling-induced prolactin rise was abolished by 16 microg nor-BNI and 5 microg beta-FNA, coincident with increased dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC):dopamine ratio in the stalk-median eminence (SME). However, after 18 h pups separation, these same doses of nor-BNI and beta-FNA did not alter the prolactin surge or DOPAC:dopamine ratios in the SME. Higher doses of nor-BNI (32 microg) and beta-FNA (10 microg) were required to inhibit suckling-induced prolactin secretion. beta-FNA (10 microg) increased the DOPAC:dopamine ratio in the SME, whereas nor-BNI (32 microg) treatment had no effect. The mu and kappa opioid receptor mRNA levels in the mediobasal hypothalamus were similar to suckled control rats after 4 h pup deprivation, but increased 1.4-fold after 18 h pup deprivation. These data support involvement of endogenous opioidergic systems in the suckling-induced prolactin rise after a prolonged (18 h) period of pup deprivation, as well as the shorter (4 h) pup deprivation period previously reported. Suppression of TIDA neuronal activity likely played a part in mu opioid receptor input to the suckling-induced prolactin rise after both 4 h and 18 h separation, whereas non-dopaminergic input was implicated with kappa opioid receptors after 18 h pup deprivation. Increased mu and kappa opioid receptors gene expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus may contribute to reduced effectiveness of opioid receptor antagonists to block suckling-induced prolactin release after 18 h pup deprivation.",M1
20033753,"Immunoglobulin gene locus events in epithelial cells of lactating mouse mammary glands.It has been believed that the immunoglobulin (Ig) found abundantly in the colostrum of lactating mammalian is derived from serum or secreted by plasma cells present in the mammary gland. The recent finding of Ig gene rearrangements in breast cancer cells and benign hyperplastic breast epithelial cells suggests that it is likely that hyperplastic mammary gland epithelial cells during <e>lactation</e> can also produce Ig. In this study, we have demonstrated the presence of abundant amounts of Ig heavy and light chain transcripts in sorted cytokeratin 18-positive mammary gland epithelial cells of lactating mice. Interestingly, we found two specific Igkappa variable region sequences (V(CW9)J(kappa1) and V(BV9)J(kappa1)) that were dominantly expressed in different strains of mice. Our data demonstrate that IgG is expressed by mammary gland epithelial cells of lactating mice, and suggest that the IgG found in murine colostrum is at least partially produced by the mammary gland epithelial cells.",M1

20463432,"Management of rheumatic diseases during pregnancy.Systemic rheumatic diseases commonly affect women during the childbearing years. Many women with these diseases may be contemplating pregnancy or discover an inadvertent pregnancy, leading to concerns regarding medication use, changes in disease activity during pregnancy, safety of <e>lactation</e>, and future ability to care for a child given the presence of chronic illnesses. There are outstanding reviews that summarize the safety and use of immunosuppressive medications during pregnancy. However, in addition to medication use, providers need to be aware of the available data regarding fertility, pregnancy outcomes, delivery, and lactation issues that may be specific to individual diseases. Optimally, women should plan pregnancies to occur around times of disease quiescence, several months after potentially teratogenic medications have been discontinued. The course of the underlying rheumatic disease during pregnancy is variable, and there are no specific clinical or laboratory variables that consistently predict disease improvement or worsening during pregnancy. Recent data suggest that increased disease activity in women with most autoimmune diseases during pregnancy may lead to increased risk of premature delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Arthritis involving the cervical spine and hips may impact delivery and must be considered by both obstetricians and obstetric anesthesiologists. Data are mixed regarding the impact of breastfeeding on underlying autoimmune diseases; the choice to continue breastfeeding is a personal decision.",M2

20409103,"Effect of pre- and postdischarge interventions on breastfeeding outcomes and weight gain among premature infants.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of pre- and postdischarge interventions on breastfeeding outcomes and weight gain among preterm infants. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) database were searched for study selection using MeSH terms infant/premature, breastfeeding, weight gain, patient discharge, postnatal care, and counseling. STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria included studies that involved preterm infants who were born less than or equal to 37 weeks of gestation, randomized controlled trials that were in English, conducted in developed countries, and had breastfeeding and weight gain outcomes. A total of 8 articles met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: All data related to breastfeeding outcomes including duration, exclusivity, maternal satisfaction, and weight gain were extracted from the randomized controlled trials for the purpose of data synthesis. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 310 studies were reviewed. Eight randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Gestational age of the infants in the studies ranged from 26 to 37 weeks. The results revealed that kangaroo care, peer counseling, in-home breast milk intake measurement, and postdischarge <e>lactation</e> support improved breastfeeding outcomes among preterm infants, and that maternal satisfaction improved with postdischarge interventions. No significant evidence of pre- and postdischarge interventions on weight gain was found. CONCLUSIONS: Pre- and postdischarge interventions were effective in promoting breastfeeding exclusivity, duration, and maternal satisfaction among mothers of preterm infants. These findings have important clinical implications that support the need for evidence-based breastfeeding interventions for preterm infants before discharge and vigilant postdischarge support. Research to determine more effective interventions to promote exclusive and long-term breastfeeding among preterm infants is required.",M2
20394228,"[Problems with the puerperal breast revealed by HIV-infected mothers]Given the recommendation not to breastfeed their infants, HIV-positive women may experience breast problems. The aim of the study was to gain knowledge regarding breast health as revealed by HIV+ women before the non-breast-feeding. This qualitative study was performed with 15 mothers with HIV/ AIDS in Fortaleza, Brazil. Recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed. The mothers revealed problems with their breasts following childbirth, such as engorgement and pain in the breasts. They revealed that they received instruction in the course of prenatal care not to breastfeed; however, there was no further instruction or care in the postpartum period. The use of <e>lactation</e> inhibitors and bandaging (binding) of the breast were reduced. Health professionals should adopt appropriate measures to guide HIV- positive parturient women. Health services need to broaden strategies to minimize the current emotional problems resulting from non-breast-feeding, as well as the discomfort in the puerperal breast.",M2
20168116,"Optimal nutrition for improved twin pregnancy outcome.Twin pregnancies contribute a disproportionate degree to perinatal morbidity, partly because of increased risks of low birth weight and prematurity. Although the cause of the morbidity is multifactorial, attention to twin-specific maternal nutrition may be beneficial in achieving optimal fetal growth and birth weight. Achievement of body mass index (BMI)-specific weight gain goals, micronutrient and macronutrient supplementation specific to the physiology of twin gestations, and carbohydrate-controlled diets are recommended for optimal twin growth and pregnancy outcomes. The daily recommended caloric intake for normal-BMI women with twins is 40-45 kcal/kg each day, and iron, folate, calcium, magnesium, and zinc supplementation is recommended beyond a usual prenatal vitamin. Daily supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid and vitamin D should also be considered. Multiple gestation-specific prenatal care settings with a focus on nutritional interventions improve birth weight and length of gestation and should be considered for the care of women carrying multiples. Antepartum <e>lactation</e> consultation can also improve the rate of postpartum breastfeeding in twin pregnancies. Twin gestation-specific nutritional interventions seem effective in improving the outcome of these pregnancies and should be emphasized in the antepartum care of multiple gestations. This review examines the available evidence and offers recommendations for twin pregnancy-specific nutritional interventions.",M2
20043706,"What do pregnant low-income women say about breastfeeding?BACKGROUND: Although low socioeconomic status and African-American race have been shown to be risk factors for low rates of breastfeeding, maternal reasons for selection of infant feeding method are not well understood in these populations. METHODS: Healthy women &gt; or =15 years of age receiving routine obstetrical care from nurses and nurse midwives at the outpatient clinic of MacDonald Women's Hospital, Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH were surveyed using a questionnaire interview including Likert-scaled and open-ended questions. All responses to the six open-ended queries were transcribed. Content analysis was used to categorize these responses into three to seven descriptive themes for each question. The authors and two other clinically experienced reviewers participated in theme development, which involved categorization by individual reviewers and then by the group; a full consensus was achieved at each stage. University Hospitals Institutional Review Board approved the study. RESULTS: Of 186 eligible women, 179 (96%) consented, and 176 (95%) were interviewed. Median age was 22 years (range, 15-41 years), 68 (41%) had greater than a high school education, 167 (95%) were African-American, 167 (non-identical 95%) were unmarried, and 87 (49%) were multiparous. When interviewees were asked,  What is the biggest reason you want to breastfeed?,  responses included maternal reasons, infant-related reasons, and advice of others. When women were asked,  What would stop you from breastfeeding?,  responses included lifestyle reasons, pain-related reasons, <e>lactation</e> process issues, hypothetical medical reasons, and maternal reluctance. CONCLUSIONS: Expectant low-income African-American inner-city women appear well informed about the benefits of breastfeeding. Obstacles to breastfeeding that may be susceptible to intervention include fear of pain, lifestyle issues, and lactation process concerns.  I want to breastfeed because I don't want to get up in the middle of the night.   I wouldn't breastfeed if it hurt.   He [the father of my baby] does not want me to breastfeed because the baby might want to suck on his nipples. ",M2
20043434,"Psychological stress and breast diseases during <e>lactation</e>.Termination of breastfeeding in the first six months after childbirth is frequently caused by breastfeeding-related diseases and problems of the breast such as pain, milk stasis or mastitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between psychological stress and the occurrence of breastfeeding associated disorders. In a prospective cohort study of 379 primiparous women without breast anomalies or diseases, psychometric data were collected from participants between the confirmation of the pregnancy and one year post-partum. Primarily, standardised questionnaires (PSQ, WHO QoL and F-SOZU K22) were used for data analysis while additional data was gathered in follow-up interviews. The subgroup analysis showed a significant relationship between stress and breastfeeding-related diseases. Women with pain, cracked nipples, milk stasis or mastitis reported a higher stress level than women without breast problems. Additionally, the majority of women with breast problems and increased psychological stress gave up breastfeeding sooner and, in contrast to the group without problems, indicated significantly more frequently that the milk quantity was insufficient. Breast diseases during lactation are associated with higher levels of psychological stress. Further studies are needed to examine the causes of the higher stress in order to develop strategies to prolong breastfeeding duration.",M2
20022733,"Mildly abnormal general movement quality in infants is associated with higher Mead acid and lower arachidonic acid and shows a U-shaped relation with the DHA/AA ratio.We showed that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> was associated with more mildly abnormal (MA) general movements (GMs) in the infants. Since this finding was unexpected and inter-individual DHA intakes are highly variable, we explored the relationship between GM quality and erythrocyte DHA, arachidonic acid (AA), DHA/AA and Mead acid in 57 infants of this trial. MA GMs were inversely related to AA, associated with Mead acid, and associated with DHA/AA in a U-shaped manner. These relationships may indicate dependence of newborn AA status on synthesis from linoleic acid. This becomes restricted during the intrauterine period by abundant de novo synthesis of oleic and Mead acids from glucose, consistent with reduced insulin sensitivity during the third trimester. The descending part of the U-shaped relation between MA GMs and DHA/AA probably indicates DHA shortage next to AA shortage. The ascending part may reflect a different developmental trajectory that is not necessarily unfavorable.",M2

Here we examined whether maternal salt preference might facilitate breastfeeding. Nursing mothers (n=327) were categorized as high, medium or low salt preferring, and the relationship to persistence of exclusive breastfeeding during the first 25 days postnatal was evaluated. Contrary to expectation, we find that mothers with low salt preference persisted in breastfeeding beyond day 7 postnatal in comparison to mothers with high salt preference, and mothers with high salt preference had the shortest exclusive breastfeeding duration up to postnatal day 25. Awareness of this among health workers and nursing mothers could contribute to successful breastfeeding.",M2
19959230,"Assessment of estrogenic activity and total lipids in maternal biological samples (serum and breast milk).The present study investigated estrogenic activity and total lipid levels in maternal serum and breast milk. The study was performed with 50 mothers from Fang district of northern Thailand. Maternal serum was collected 5 times, including the second trimester, pre-delivery period, delivery period, and lactating period at day 30 and day 60. Breast milk was collected 7 times, including day 1, 7, 14, 21, 30, 45, and 60 of <e>lactation</e>. There were the same patterns of variation between estrogenicity and total lipid levels both in serum and breast milk. The correlation between serum estrogenicity and serum total lipids was found with a correlation coefficient (r) ranging from 0.403 to 0.661. However, no correlation was found between milk estrogenicity and milk total lipids. The results therefore suggest that lipid contents might be the major factors affecting the variation of estrogenicity levels, and xenoestrogens, which the mother subjects exposed, were lipophilic pollutants. The remarkable findings were that the mean levels of estrogenicity in breast milk were approximately 8-13.5 times higher than those in maternal serum compared at the same period. However, no correlation was found between estrogenicity levels in serum and breast milk, leading to decreased accuracy in predicted infant exposure by maternal serum.",M2

19927603,"Implementing an integrated nutrition package at large scale in Madagascar: the Essential Nutrition Actions framework.BACKGROUND: Madagascar has some of the highest rates of child stunting, maternal malnutrition, and infant mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: To improve infant and young child feeding practices, increase uptake of micronutrient supplements, and improve women's dietary practices through implementation of a nutrition project based on the Essential Nutrition Actions (ENA) framework. METHODS: Interventions included training, interpersonal communication, community mobilization, and mass media. Changes in practices were assessed through a comparison of data for children under 2 years of age from representative cross-sectional household surveys collected at baseline in 2000 (n = 1,200) and at the end of program implementation in 2005 (n = 1,760). The surveys were conducted in six districts with a population of 1.4 million. RESULTS: The rate of initiation of breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth increased from 32% to 68%, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding of infants under 6 months of age increased from 42% to 70%, the rate of continuation of breastfeeding at 20 to 23 months increased from 43% to 73%, the rate of feeding children the minimum recommended number of meals per day at 6 to 23 months increased from 87% to 93%, the rate of iron-folic acid supplementation during pregnancy increased from 32% to 76%, and the rate of postpartum vitamin A supplementation increased from 17% to 54% (p &lt; .001 for all changes). Modest improvement was achieved in maternal dietary practices during <e>lactation</e> and feeding of the sick child after illness. The results were inconclusive regarding food diversity for complementary feeding. No improvements were reported in increasing food intake during child illness or pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The ENA framework allows broad-scale improvement of nutritional practices to be achieved through the maximization of contacts using multiple program opportunities within existing health systems and community structures and through mass media.",M2
19907930,"Perceived breast milk insufficiency in mothers of neonates hospitalized in neonatal intensive care unit.OBJECTIVE: A) To study the frequency of perceived breast milk insufficiency in mothers of hospitalized neonates. b) To assess subsequent duration of exclusive breast feeding and growth (upto three months) in neonates whose mothers perceived breast milk insufficiency. METHODS: Neonates whose mothers were willing to breastfeed their babies were included in the study. Their breastfeeding status was assessed and the mother's perception of breastfeeding was elicited as per WHO guidelines. In mothers who perceived breast milk insufficiency (crisis group), causes for such a perception were looked into. Mothers were regularly counseled to breastfeed the infant After discharge the mother infant dyad were followed up for three months and babies evaluated for weight, length and head circumference. RESULTS: Three hundred and seven neonates and their mothers fulfilling the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Perceived breast milk insufficiency was present in 208 (68%) mothers. Common reasons for such a perception were irrational. In the crisis group, 35% mothers had preterm babies as compared to 16% in the non crisis group (p =0.001). One hundred and fifty three mothers (73.33%) in the crisis group had breast milk sodium levels&gt;16 mmol/L as compared to 12 mothers (12.12%) in the non crisis group (p 0.001). Micturition &lt;6 times/24 hours was reported in 166 (83%) mothers in crisis group as compared to 18 (18.1%) mothers in non crisis group. All mothers who perceived breast milk insufficiency could be helped by <e>lactation</e> management and exclusively breastfed their babies. All infants were exclusively breastfed at discharge and at three month follow up. The growth of the infants was satisfactory in the crisis group at 3 months follow up. CONCLUSION: The Present study suggests that lactation failure following delayed initiation of breastfeeding can be countered by subsequent intensive counselling. Emphasis is required on counselling for breastfeeding in primary neonatal care.",M2
19900072,"Mid-pregnancy androgen levels are negatively associated with breastfeeding.OBJECTIVE: Breastfeeding depends on endocrine changes during pregnancy. The association between gestational hormones and <e>lactation</e> has been sparsely investigated. Previously, androgens were used for lactation inhibition. We investigated a possible association between second trimester maternal androgen levels and breastfeeding. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: University hospital setting. POPULATION. Women from a random sample of pregnancies (n = 63) and from a group with an increased risk for giving birth to a small-for-gestational age newborn (n = 118) were included. All participants had singleton pregnancies and one or two previous births. METHODS: Maternal androgen levels were measured in gestational week 25. The association with reported breastfeeding was explored by univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. Analyses were adjusted for factors known to be associated with breastfeeding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Breastfeeding at six weeks, three months, and six months postpartum. RESULTS: In the random group, breastfeeding at three and six months was negatively associated with maternal testosterone, androstendione, and free testosterone index levels. After correction for maternal age, education and smoking, breastfeeding at both three and six months was negatively associated with the free testosterone index. In the group of women with an increased risk for giving birth to a small-for-gestational age newborn, breastfeeding at six weeks and three months was associated negatively with maternal dehydroepiandrosterone and this association persisted after correction for maternal age, education, and smoking.

Unfortunately, little evidence guides clinicians on when to screen for vitamin D deficiency or effective treatment options.",M2
19836604,"Contribution of chiropractic therapy to resolving suboptimal breastfeeding: a case series of 114 infants.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the circumstances, clinical features, role, and results of chiropractic management of infants who were referred to a chiropractic clinic for failure to adequately feed at the breast. METHODS: Clinical case series of 114 infant cases of hospital-diagnosed or <e>lactation</e> consultant diagnosed feeding problems that were treated with chiropractic therapy in addition to routine care and followed to short-term result. RESULTS: The most common age of referral was 1 week (mean, 3 weeks; range, 2 days-12 weeks), and the most common physical findings were cervical posterior joint dysfunction (89%), temporomandibular joint imbalance (36%), and inadequate suck reflex (34%). Treatment was chiropractic therapy in addition to any support given elsewhere. All children showed some improvement with 78% (N = 89) being able to exclusively breast feed after 2 to 5 treatments within a 2-week time period. CONCLUSION: Cooperative multidisciplinary care to support breastfeeding was demonstrated in this population. Chiropractic treatment may be a useful adjunct to routine care given by other professionals in cases of diagnosed breastfeeding problems with a biomechanical component.",M2
19827921,"Progress in protecting, promoting, and supporting breastfeeding: 1984-2009.The 1984 Surgeon General's Workshop on Breastfeeding delineated six priority areas for action to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding. In this article, we examine trends in breastfeeding behaviors and recall key events and actions that shaped these behaviors over the past 25 years. We examine progress in breastfeeding support through workplaces, public education, professional education, health system changes, support services, and research. Rates of initiation of breastfeeding more than doubled from a nadir of only 26.5% in 1970 to 61.9% in 1982. Initiation fell to 51.5% in 1990, but has risen almost monotonically since then to 74.2% in 2005. Trends in breastfeeding at 6 months have paralleled initiation trends. Black-white disparities have narrowed for breastfeeding initiation but not for continuation to 6 months. Considerable progress in breastfeeding support has been seen over the past 25 years, with more employers allowing women time and space to express milk at work, more states enacting legislation to ensure that accommodations are made for employed women and protect the right to breastfeed in public, more opportunities for physician education on breastfeeding, expansion of professional <e>lactation</e> services, and substantial increases in the amount of research on breastfeeding. However, only 21.4% of babies are breastfed for a year, and only 11.9% exclusively breastfeed for 6 months. Only 2% of babies are born in facilities that meet international standards of care, and 74% of employers do not offer lactation rooms or accommodations for breastfeeding. Thus, in spite of considerable progress, significant gaps remain in protecting, promoting, and supporting breastfeeding.",M2
19827919,"A summary of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's evidence report on breastfeeding in developed countries.OBJECTIVES: This article summarizes the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's evidence report on the effects of breastfeeding on term infant and maternal health outcomes in developed countries. EVIDENCE REPORT DATA SOURCES: Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, bibliographies of selected reviews, and suggestions from domain experts were surveyed. Searches were limited to English-language publications. EVIDENCE REPORT REVIEW METHODS: Eligible comparisons examined the association between differential exposure to breastfeeding and health outcomes. We assessed 15 infant and six maternal outcomes. For four outcomes, we also updated previously published systematic reviews. For the rest of the outcomes, we either summarized previous systematic reviews or conducted new systematic reviews; randomized and non-randomized comparative trials, prospective cohorts, and case-control studies were included. Adjusted estimates were extracted from non-experimental designs. The studies were graded for methodological quality. We did not draw conclusions from poor quality studies. EVIDENCE REPORT RESULTS: We screened over 9,000 abstracts. Thirty-two primary studies on term infant health outcomes, 43 primary studies on maternal health outcomes, and 28 systematic reviews or meta-analyses that covered approximately 400 individual studies were included in this review. A history of breastfeeding was associated with a reduction in the risk of acute otitis media, nonspecific gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, asthma (young children), obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, childhood leukemia, and sudden infant death syndrome. There was no relationship between breastfeeding in term infants and cognitive performance. There were insufficient good quality data to address the relationship between breastfeeding and cardiovascular diseases and infant mortality. For maternal outcomes, a history of <e>lactation</e> was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, breast, and ovarian cancer. Early cessation of breastfeeding or no breastfeeding was associated with an increased risk of maternal postpartum depression. There was no relationship between a history of lactation and the risk of osteoporosis. The effect of breastfeeding in mothers on return-to-prepregnancy weight was negligible, and the effect of breastfeeding on postpartum weight loss was unclear. EVIDENCE REPORT CONCLUSIONS: A history of breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of many diseases in infants and mothers. Future research would benefit from clearer selection criteria, definitions of breastfeeding exposure, and adjustment for potential confounders. Matched designs such as sibling analysis may provide a method to control for hereditary and household factors that are important in certain outcomes.",M2
19779839,"Breastfeeding and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer.OBJECTIVE: Several studies have found inverse associations between breastfeeding and ovarian cancer occurrence but there are inconsistencies. The relationship with breastfeeding duration is unclear, and it is uncertain whether the association varies according to histological subtype of ovarian cancer. We sought to clarify these issues. METHODS: Parous women who participated in an Australia-wide population-based case-control study of epithelial ovarian cancer between 2001 and 2005 (1,092 cases and 1,288 controls) completed a reproductive/lifestyle questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals to investigate relations between breastfeeding and ovarian cancer. RESULTS: We found a strong inverse association between total duration of breastfeeding (all episodes combined) and ovarian cancer occurrence (OR = 0.986, 95% CI 0.978-0.994 per month of breastfeeding) that appeared to be independent of parity. However, individual episodes of <e>lactation</e> beyond 12 months conferred no appreciable additional benefit. The relation with breastfeeding appeared to vary by histological subtype such that we saw no association between duration of breastfeeding and borderline serous cancers or mucinous cancers, but inverse associations for the other subtypes, although these were not always statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: A long total duration of breastfeeding appears to be associated with a substantial reduction in the overall risk of ovarian cancer, independent of the decrease in risk due to childbirth, but this may vary according to histological subtype.",M2
19768333,"[Social representations of women who breastfeed about breast feeding and the use of pacifiers]The objective was to identify the different meanings that surround the breastfeeding and the use of pacifiers of a group of mothers of children under six months old. Adopted to the precepts of qualitative research methodology. Interviews were conducted semi-structured individual, transcribed in full and analyzed using the technique to analyse the content of Bardin. The comprehensive analysis of speeches revealed the presence of representations which can carry interference in the decision to breastfeed - both positive, as negatively. In that sense, it is important that health professionals, know the context in which these women are found, especially their doubts, fears, myths and beliefs in relation to breastfeeding, thus acting in favour of <e>lactation</e>.",M2
19762295,"[Analgesic effect of breastfeeding when taking blood by heel-prick in newborns]OBJECTIVE: To compare the analgesic effectiveness of breastfeeding when taking blood by the heel-lance procedure in healthy newborns, as opposed to other procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 228 term infants from the Maternity Unit of our Hospital. The study was developed in two consecutive phases. In the first stage, 150 newborns were distributed into three randomised groups, the first group (50 newborns) did not receive any specific analgesic intervention; the second and third groups (50 newborns) received non-nutritive sucking-placebo or non-nutritive sucking-24% sucrose respectively. In the second phase, 78 newborns participated, and the blood was taken during breast-feeding. The results on a discomfort scale were compared with those obtained in the rest of examined analgesic procedures. RESULTS: The group that received analgesia with breast-feeding showed a score on the discomfort scale of 0'62 and an average time of crying of 0'19s. The comparative analysis of the results obtained during breastfeeding, as opposed to the rest of procedures, showed that breast-feeding is the best analgesic option, with a reduction in the discomfort of 51% and of 98% in the time of crying (P&lt;0,001). CONCLUSIONS: Breast-feeding during the blood test by heel-prick procedure represents the most effective analgesic method. A containment procedure along with non-nutritive sucking is the analgesic method of choice in the newborn that does not receive maternal <e>lactation</e>.",M2
19759350,"Evaluation of a breastfeeding assessment score in a diverse population.A previous study performed in a predominately suburban population developed a breastfeeding assessment score (BAS) that was designed to predict, prior to hospital discharge, those mothers who would discontinue breastfeeding within the first 10 days of age. The purpose of the present study was to assess the BAS in a more diverse population. Patients were solicited from 3 urban hospitals serving patients primarily supported by public funding. Results of the present study with 1182 mother-infant pairs confirmed that 5 variables scored on a 0-2 scale (maternal age, previous breastfeeding experience, latching difficulty, breastfeeding interval, number bottles) remained highly significant for predicting discontinuation of breastfeeding. The data also demonstrate that the BAS is inversely related to the risk of cessation of breastfeeding at 7 to 10 days of age. Those at an early risk of cessation of breastfeeding, identified by the BAS, may benefit from early identification and a <e>lactation</e> consultation.",M2
19703327,"Supplementation of DHA but not DHA with arachidonic acid during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> influences general movement quality in 12-week-old term infants.DHA and arachidonic acid (AA) are important for neurodevelopment. A traditional neonatal neurological examination and the evaluation of general movement quality are sensitive techniques for assessing neurodevelopment in young infants. Mildly abnormal general movements at 3 months have been associated with a non-optimal current brain condition. We investigated whether supplementation of DHA during pregnancy and lactation influences the infant's brain development and whether additional AA modulates this effect. Healthy women were randomly assigned to DHA (220 mg/d, n 42), DHA+AA (220 mg each/d, n 41) or control (n 36), from about week 17 (range 14-20 weeks) of pregnancy until 12 weeks postpartum. The control and the DHA+AA groups had approximately comparable dietary DHA/AA ratios. The standardised neonatal neurological examination was carried out at 2 weeks. General movement quality was assessed at 2 and 12 weeks. Neither DHA alone nor DHA+AA influenced outcomes in the traditional examination. General movement quality of infants in the DHA group was lower than that of infants in the other two groups, especially at 12 weeks: 61 % of the infants in the DHA group showed mildly abnormal general movements compared with 31 % in the control group (P = 0.008) and 34 % in the DHA+AA group (P = 0.015). We conclude that general movement quality at 12 weeks is sensitive to the maternal dietary DHA/AA balance.",M2
19667298,"<e>Lactation</e> and incidence of premenopausal breast cancer: a longitudinal study.BACKGROUND: Findings from observational studies suggest an inverse association between lactation and premenopausal breast cancer risk, but results are inconsistent, and data from large prospective cohort studies are lacking. METHODS: We used information from 60,075 parous women participating in the prospective cohort study of the Nurses' Health Study II from 1997 to 2005. Our primary outcome was incident premenopausal breast cancer. RESULTS: We ascertained 608 incident cases of premenopausal breast cancer during 357,556 person-years of follow-up. Women who had ever breastfed had a covariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.00) for premenopausal breast cancer compared with women who had never breastfed. No linear trend was found with duration of total lactation (P = .95), exclusive lactation (P = .74), or lactation amenorrhea (P = .88). The association between lactation and premenopausal breast cancer was modified by family history of breast cancer (P value for interaction = .03). Among women with a first-degree relative with breast cancer, those who had ever breastfed had a covariate-adjusted HR of 0.41 (95% CI, 0.22-0.75) for premenopausal breast cancer compared with women who had never breastfed, whereas no association was observed among women without a family history of breast cancer. CONCLUSION: In this large, prospective cohort study of parous premenopausal women, having ever breastfed was inversely associated with incidence of breast cancer among women with a family history of breast cancer.",M2
19652195,"The differential impact of WIC peer counseling programs on breastfeeding initiation across the state of Maryland.This cross-sectional study examines Maryland's women, infants, and children (WIC) breastfeeding initiation rates by program participation. The authors report on data regarding demographic and health characteristics and infant feeding practices for infants (n = 18,789) newly WIC-certified from January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2007. The authors compared self-reported, breastfeeding initiation rates for 3 groups: peer counselor (PC-treatment group) and two comparison groups, <e>lactation</e> consultant (LC), and standard care group (SCG). Reported breastfeeding initiation at certification was 55.4%. Multiple logistic regression analysis, controlling for relevant maternal and infant characteristics, showed that the odds of breastfeeding initiation were significantly greater among PC-exposed infants (OR [95% CI] 1.27 [1.18, 1.37]) compared to the reference group of SCG infants, but not significantly different between LC infants (1.04 [0.96, 1.14]) and the SCG.

DESIGN: A cross-section, descriptive study. Setting: Institute for the Care of Mother and Child, Prague; Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics at the Institute of Postgraduate Education in Healthcare, Prague; Cegedim Strategic Data CZ s.r.o., Prague. METHODOLOGY: The method involved a written questionnaire in a structured form. The investigation was undertaken in two phases; the first round took place directly after giving birth, while the second took place 6 months after giving birth. The group consisted of 4535 women who gave birth at the Institute for the Care of Mother and Child in the period between 15. 11. 2006 - 15. 11. 2007. RESULTS: 2540 women (56.0%) answered the questions in the first round; 85% of them were in the 26-35 age group, 44.3% were secondary school graduates and 36.7% were university graduates. 61.3% were first-time mothers, 32.3% were second-time mothers and 5.4% were third-time mothers. Contraception used before current gravidity: (n=2540) oral hormonal contraception 59.7%, a condom 11.1%, intrauterine contraception 1.0% and 20.6% of the women used no contraceptive method. The users of oral hormonal contraception (n=1517) were most frequently prescribed (12.8% of the women) a preparation containing 20 microg ethinylestradiol and 150 eLg desogestrel (Mercilon). The contraception used during the course of lactation after a birth in the group of mothers of more than one child (n=982): oral hormonal contraception 19.6%, a condom 17.1%, intrauterine contraception 1.3%, no contraceptive method 54.5%. Breastfeeding users of oral hormonal contraception (n=192) were most frequently prescribed (20.3% of women) a preparation containing 500 microg lynestrenol (Exluton) and a preparation containing 75 microg desogestrel (Cerazette) (16.1% of women). The contraceptive methods planned by women after birth (n=2540): oral hormonal contraceptive 36.5%, a condom 18.8%, intrauterine contraception 18.8%, no method 20.1%. 1440 women (56.7%) answered the questions in the second round; 83.5% of them were in the 26-35 age group, 45.0% were secondary school graduates and 37.0% were university graduates. 64.4% were first-time mothers, 30.6% were second time mothers and 4.2% were third-time mothers. 74.6% of women were still breastfeeding 6 months after giving birth. Contraception used by breastfeeding women (n=1074): oral hormone contraception 27.6%, a condom 21.8%, an intrauterine system with levonorgestrel 2.8%, intrauterine contraception 2.4%, no method 39.5%. Contraception used by non-breastfeeding women (n=366): oral hormonal contraception 42.1%, a condom 15.0%, an intrauterine system with levonorgestrel 2.7%, intrauterine contraception 2.7%, no method 31.4%. In both groups of women, the users of oral hormonal contraception were most frequently prescribed a preparation containing 75 pg desogestrel (Cerazette); this accounted for 99.3% of the breastfeeding women and 18.8% of those not breastfeeding. 40.0% of breastfeeding and 48.4% of non-breastfeeding women are planning to use hormonal contraception in the coming period. The self-evaluation of the knowledge of contraception methods (n=2540): 61.6% of women evaluated their knowledge as good, but 77.6% of women did not know a suitable hormonal contraceptive for the period of lactation. According to 80.7% of the women, their main source of expert information in the area of family planning is their gynaecologist. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of breastfeeding women 6 months after giving birth is high in the monitored group. Oral hormonal contraceptives are the most frequently used contraceptive method in general, including during the lactation period when women prefer a preparation containing 75 microg desogestrel regardless of whether or not they are breastfeeding. The women's knowledge of suitable methods of contraception during the period of lactation is unsatisfactory and represents a challenge for healthcare providers to improve the amount of information available to women in this area",M2

19607746,"Evaluation of the Missouri WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) breast-feeding peer counselling programme.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the peer counselling (PC) programme on breast-feeding initiation among participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in Missouri, and to identify factors that facilitate breast-feeding initiation. DESIGN: We used the data from the 2006 Missouri Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System, Missouri Live Birth Records and the Missouri WIC programme to compare breast-feeding initiation rates between PC and non-PC agencies. We used multilevel logistic regression, with individual participants being nested within agencies, to control for individual- and agency-level characteristics. RESULTS: The breast-feeding initiation rate in PC agencies was significantly higher than in non-PC agencies among prenatal participants, but the difference was not significant among postpartum participants. After controlling for maternal sociodemographic characteristics, compared with prenatal cases in non-PC agencies, prenatal cases in PC agencies were more likely to initiate breast-feeding (OR = 1.21; 95 % CI 1.03, 1.43), whereas postpartum cases were less likely to initiate breast-feeding. Among prenatal participants in PC agencies, longer duration of prenatal WIC enrolment was associated with a higher rate of breast-feeding initiation. After adjusting for maternal sociodemographic characteristics and other agency-level characteristics, participants of PC agencies with an international board-certified <e>lactation</e> consultant were more likely to initiate breast-feeding than participants of PC agencies without such a consultant (OR = 1.21; 95 % CI 1.01, 1.45). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal participation in the WIC breast-feeding PC programme (especially participation early during pregnancy) was associated with an increased rate of breast-feeding initiation in Missouri.",M2

Data were collected prospectively, by maternal interview and medical record review. During hospitalization, 159 (86%) infants received at least 50% HM proportion of feedings in the first 2 weeks of life, and 114 (62%) received some HM until the day of hospital discharge. Analysis showed plan to breastfeed was the strongest predictor of initiation and duration of HM feeding. Greater than 12 years of education, respiratory distress syndrome, Apgar score &gt;6, and female gender were significant predictors, and no perinatal hypertensive disorder, white race, and mechanical ventilation were marginal predictors of HM feeding. Women with a high-risk pregnancy should be provided education about the benefits of breastfeeding for infants who are likely to be born prematurely.",M2
19594415,"Human exposure to endocrine disruptors and breast milk.Endocrine system is one of the most sensitive communication networks of the human body which influences all aspects of human health and well-being, including reproductive potential, cognitive functions, thyroid and metabolism, digestion and hormonal balance. In recent years basic laboratory research has been focused on the potential relationship between environmental contaminants and cellular endocrine function. Environmental contaminants are ubiquitous in the environment, alter endocrine physiology and produce endocrine disruption without acting as classic toxicants. These endocrine disruptors (EDCs) are lipophilic and stored for long periods of time in the adipose tissue. Maternal exposure to EDCs during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> has as a result the exposure of the fetus and neonate through placenta and breast milk. It has been recognized that human milk is the best natural food for neonates providing immunologic, developmental and practical advantages throughout childhood. However, contamination of human milk by the presence of environmental toxicants is widespread through the past decades due to inadequately controlled pollution. Persistent pesticides, chemical solvents and others tend to invade slowly the environment, to bioaccumulate in the food chain and to have long half-lives in animals and humans. During the past fifteen years, the scientific interest has been focused on xenoestrogens, i.e.,environmental chemicals with estrogen disrupting activity. Certain adverse health and reproductive outcomes are attributed to these chemicals in wildlife, in laboratory animals, as well as in humans. Although most toxic agents are hazardous in high doses, the human health risks associated with EDCs concern exposure to low doses. The human health risks that may be associated with these low-level but constant exposures are still largely unknown and highly controversial. In this paper, we review available data on environmental chemicals present in breast milk that may affect child health through breastfeeding. Specifically, we focused on the breast-feeding pharmacokinetic aspects related to infant exposure of chemical pollutants that have estrogen and antiandrogen activities, such as environmental estrogen disruptors or xenoestrogens.",M2

To describe the development of the weight during the first year of life and the demand of paediatric consultations in relation to the type of lactation. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done using retrospective data. There was gathered a random sample of clinical histories of born children between years 2000 and 2005. There was estimated the prevalence of breast-feeding from the beginning until three and six months. An index of global desertion was elaborated. The average weight and the number of paediatric consultations were related to the type of lactation. RESULTS: The children initiate exclusive breastfeeding (MEL) in a 63.5% (CI 95%: 58.6-64.5). 22.6% amount them (IC 95%: 18.4-26.9) remained it until six months age. After three months of MEL 43.4% of the subjects gave up exclusively lactation. At the age of six months only 33.6% remained with MEL. Mixed form of lactation (MTL) was kept in 80.5% of the subjects (IC 95%: 75.4-84.6). Children included in the program of MTL (exclusive or mixed) have a minor index of desertion (26.5% and 54.4% up to three and six months, respectively). A higher weight was detected in children with mixed lactation. Those on the MEL up to six months consulted the paediatrician 4.5 times a year, whereas children with artificial lactation did it 6.5 times during their first year of life. There were statistically significant differences found (p &lt; 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Percentage of lactation in the group studied is far from recommended levels (WHO). Exclusive breastfeeding (MEL) entails a suitable weight development, as well as a minor morbidity in the first year of life.",M2

19515230,"Fatty acid patterns early after premature birth, simultaneously analysed in mothers' food, breast milk and serum phospholipids of mothers and infants.BACKGROUND: The supply of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids via the placenta is interrupted in premature infants, making them exclusively dependent on breast milk, which varies in fatty acid (FA) concentrations depending on the mother's diet. OBJECTIVE: To in a longitudinal study explore the relation between FA status in mothers and infants from an unselected cohort of prematures, not requiring intensive care. DESIGN: Breast milk and mothers' and infants' plasma phospholipid FA concentrations from birth to 44 weeks of gestational age were analysed and compared with mothers' food intake, assessed using a 3-day diary. Fatty acids were analysed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The energy intake was low in 75% of mothers, and 90% had low intake of essential FAs (EFAs). Dietary linoleic acid (LA, 18:2w6), but not w3 FAs, correlated to concentrations in breast milk. Infants' plasma and breast milk correlated for arachidonic (AA, 20:4w6), eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5w3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6w3) acids. A high concentration of mead acid (20:3w9) in the infants at birth correlated negatively to the concentrations of LA, AA and w3 FAs. Infants of mothers who stopped breastfeeding during the study period showed decreased DHA concentrations and increased w6/w3 ratios, with the opposite FA pattern seen in the mothers' plasma. CONCLUSION: Although dietary w3 FAs were insufficient in an unselected cohort of mothers of premature infants, breastfeeding resulted in increased levels of DHA in the premature infants at the expense of the mothers, suggesting a general need to increase dietary w3 FAs during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e>.",M2

19464025,"Does the recommendation to use a pacifier influence the prevalence of breastfeeding?OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the recommendation to offer a pacifier once <e>lactation</e> is well established reduces the prevalence or duration of breastfeeding. STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority, controlled trial comprising 1021 mothers highly motivated to breastfeed whose newborns regained birth weight by 15 days. They were assigned to offer versus not to offer pacifiers. Primary outcome was prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months. Main secondary outcomes were the prevalence of exclusive and any breastfeeding at different ages and duration of any breastfeeding. RESULTS: At 3 months, 85.8% infants in the offer pacifier group and 86.2% in the not offer pacifier group were exclusively breastfeeding (risk difference, 0.4%; 95% CI, -4.9%-4.1%), satisfying the pre-specified non-inferiority requirement of -7%. Furthermore, the recommendation to offer a pacifier did not produce a significant decrease in the frequency of exclusive and any breastfeeding at different ages or in the duration of lactation. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendation to offer a pacifier at 15 days does not modify the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding. Because pacifier use is associated with reduced incidence of sudden infant death syndrome, the recommendation to offer a pacifier appears safe and appropriate in similar populations.",M2

AIM: To describe the patterns of use of MotherSafe over a three-year period. METHODS: Retrospective descriptive epidemiological study using data from the database established at MotherSafe. Records from all the calls logged at MotherSafe between January 2005 and December 2007 were analysed to determine total number of calls, demographic characteristics of callers, including age, caller category and postcode, reason for call, source of referral and type of exposure. RESULTS: A total of 47,138 calls were recorded to the MotherSafe service from January 2005 to December 2007. The majority of calls were regarding exposures in pregnancy (55%) and breast-feeding (38%). Average age of patients was 32.3 years. Of the calls made, 81.9% (38,485 of 46,968) were by consumers (the pregnant or lactating woman herself or a relative). The most common primary exposure categories were: over-the-counter medications (11.3%), psychotropic medication (9.0%), herbal or vitamin products (8.2%), antibiotics (7.0%), gastrointestinal medications (6.8%) and topical products (6.6%).

More intensive efforts and public awareness is required if the ideals of a baby friendly hospital are to be met.",M2
19378274,"Breastfeeding structure as a test of parental investment theory in Papua New Guinea.Evolutionary parental investment theory predicts that parents invest preferentially in offspring best able to translate investments into fitness payoffs. It has also been proposed that where the reproductive prospects of offspring are directly correlated with parental investment and variance in fertility is higher for males than females, parents in better condition should bias investment toward males while those in poorer condition should bias investment toward females. <e>Lactation</e> is arguably among the costliest forms of investment expended by mothers and is thus expected to be allocated in ways consistent with fitness payoffs. Quantitative data collected among 110 Papua New Guinean mother-infant pairs during 470 h of focal follows on nursing frequency and duration and responses to infant demands by maternal and offspring characteristics are presented to provide empirically-based descriptions of infant care and tests of evolutionary parental investment theory. Results indicate that mothers show very high levels of investment in offspring. However, although breastfeeding in developing countries is often characterized as on-demand, fussing and crying by infants were only attended to with breastfeeding about 30% of the time. Contrary to expectations of parental investment theory that parents should invest less in poorer quality offspring, mothers increased investment in offspring in poorer condition. The expectation that mothers in better condition would bias investment toward male offspring was also not supported; better nourished mothers biased investment toward female offspring. This study illustrates how infant feeding data may be used for testing larger evolutionary questions such as those derived from parental investment theory.",M2
19365978,"Discrepant cytologic and radiographic findings in adjacent galactocele and fibroadenoma: a case report.BACKGROUND: Clinical, radiologic and pathologic evaluation of a breast mass during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> often presents a challenge. We report a case of a longstanding benign breast mass that was negative on fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) but sonographically appeared suspicious for carcinoma. CASE: A 41-year-old patient presented with a long-standing benign breast nodule that increased in size postpartum and became painful. The patient was breastfeeding when she developed mastitis in the surrounding area and was treated with antibiotics. The inflammation resolved, but the original mass persisted. FNA of the mass yielded thick, whitish material that on microscopic examination showed clusters of ductal cells with striking reactive, reparative and lactation changes admixed with amorphous material and crystals. The smear pattern was interpreted as negative. However, the sonogram revealed a solid lesion with mixed echogenicity suspicious for malignancy. The patient underwent lumpectomy, which showed concomitant fibroadenoma and galactocele. CONCLUSION: We suspect that in lactating patients preexisting breast masses may interfere with the milk flow, thus rendering the breast tissue around the mass prone to galactocele formation. This may result in erroneous clinical and radiologic impression of growth and transformation of a preexisting lesion.",M2
19364685,"Breastfeeding and the basal insulin requirement in type 1 diabetic women.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether breastfeeding in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated with a decreased insulin requirement. METHODS: In this prospective study conducted between September 2006 and August 2008, type 1 diabetic pregnant women were recruited before the third trimester of pregnancy. Eligible women had no evidence of diabetes-related complications and were treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy. During pregnancy and in the first 8 weeks of the postpartum period, participants performed daily fingerstick blood glucose monitoring with at least 12 measurements per day; insulin dosages were adjusted to maintain normoglycemia. Participant characteristics, diabetic parameters, and neonatal growth were compared between women who breastfed exclusively and women who did not breastfeed. RESULTS: Of 18 women, 12 breastfed and 6 did not. Compared with nonbreastfeeding mothers, breastfeeding mothers showed a decreased need for total daily basal insulin (0.21 +/- 0.05 units/kg per day vs 0.33 +/- 0.02 units/kg per day). The mean value of total daily basal insulin was significantly lower in the breastfeeding group than in the non-breastfeeding group. The mean number of hyperglycemic episodes in the first 2 weeks post partum and during the third to eighth weeks was not different between the groups. However, the mean number of hypoglycemic episodes in the first 2 weeks post partum in the breastfeeding group was significantly higher than in the nonbreastfeeding group (11.9 +/- 2.6 episodes vs 5.5 +/- 1.6 episodes, P&lt;.001). No differences were observed between the groups in neonatal birth weight or infant weight after 8 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased need in total daily basal insulin is caused by increased glucose use during <e>lactation</e>. We recommend that the starting total daily basal insulin dosage for type 1 diabetic women who breastfeed be calculated as 0.21 units times the weight in kg per day. This regimen results in normoglycemia and minimizes the risk of severe hypoglycemia associated with lactation.",M2
19361010,"Evaluating the safety of medications during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e>.This article describes the types and limitations of studies conducted to evaluate the safety of medications during pregnancy and lactation. Conducting randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing drugs and placebo in patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding is considered unethical, because of the potential risk exposure to the fetus or neonate. Drug data on pregnancy outcomes and lactation effects can be derived from animal studies, but these studies cannot guarantee safety in lieu of clinical research in people. Human studies include case reports and epidemiology studies. In the absence of RCTs, epidemiology studies are the best way to identify associations between drug exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Potential limitations of epidemiology studies include sample size, length of follow up, appropriate selection of comparison control groups, and recall bias. Determining the effects of drug exposure during breastfeeding depend on understanding the extent of drug transfer into breast milk, the effects of drugs on milk production and composition, and the extent and consequent effects on breast-fed infants of exposure to drugs in breast milk.",M2
19298623,"Long hospitalization is the most important risk factor for early weaning from breast milk in premature babies.AIM: To identify certain variables related to the infants' course that might have an impact on the mothers' decision to breastfeed. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective survey including all patients &lt;1500 g birth weight (BW) treated between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2005 at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the Medical University of Vienna who were not transferred to another hospital. Multiple regression analysis of the following variables was carried out: gestational age (GA), BW, length of stay (LOS), parity, singleton or multiple gestation, sex and severe morbidity. RESULTS: Of the 239 patients included, 142 (60%) were fed breast milk at the time of final discharge, 97 (40%) were fed formula. LOS was significantly correlated with the probability of being breastfed: the shorter it was, the higher was the probability of being breastfed at the time of final discharge (p = 0.0064 for singletons, p = 0.001 for multiples). Lower GA also increased the probability of being breastfed, but this was only statistically significant for multiples (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study shows clearly that the most important influencing factor on the mothers' decision to continue breastfeeding is the LOS. Thus more emphasis should be put on encouraging mothers to continue <e>lactation</e> throughout their babies' hospital stay.",M2
19298003,"Interactions between metabolic and reproductive functions in the resumption of postpartum fecundity.<e>Lactation</e> has long been recognized as a major determinant of interbirth intervals. The temporal pattern of nursing has been proposed as the mechanism behind lactational amenorrhea. We present a new model of the dynamic regulation of lactational amenorrhea that identifies maternal energy availability as the main determinant of ovarian resumption. Variation in the intensity of lactation remains a component of the model as a determinant of the absolute energetic cost of milk production. However, maternal energy supply determines net energy availability; a larger energy supply leaves a greater net energy surplus than a smaller energy supply (lactation costs being equal). We characterize the hormonal postpartum profile of 70 lactating Toba women of Argentina. We use C-peptide, which reflects maternal insulin production, as a measure of energy availability. Initially low, insulin production rises as the postpartum period progresses, reflecting the declining metabolic load of lactation. A short period of supernormal insulin production precedes menstrual resumption. The high levels of insulin may play a role in stimulating the resumption of ovarian activity, which in turn may help to resolve the transient period of insulin resistance. The dynamics of insulin sensitivity during lactation would aid in synchronizing the resumption of ovarian function with a reduction in the energy demands of milk production. This hypothesis is supported by the sustained weight gain experienced by lactating women during the months preceding the first postpartum menses. The link between fecundity and energy balance could serve as a mechanism for adjusting the duration of lactational amenorrhea to the relative metabolic load of lactation.",M2
19278384,"Hospital Education in <e>Lactation</e> Practices (Project HELP): does clinician education affect breastfeeding initiation and exclusivity in the hospital?BACKGROUND: A woman's decision to breastfeed may be influenced by her health care practitioners, but breastfeeding knowledge among clinicians is often lacking. Project HELP (Hospital Education in Lactation Practices) was an intensive education program designed to increase breastfeeding knowledge among health care practitioners. The purpose of this study was to determine whether educating practitioners affected breastfeeding initiation and exclusivity rates at hospitals with low breastfeeding rates. METHODS: Between March 31, 2005, and April 24, 2006, we taught courses at four Massachusetts hospitals with low breastfeeding rates. Each course consisted of three, 4-hour teaching sessions and was offered nine times. The training, taught by public health professionals, perinatal clinicians, and peer counselors, covered a broad range of breastfeeding-related topics, from managing hyperbilirubinemia to providing culturally competent care. Medical records of infants born before and after the intervention were reviewed to determine demographics and infant feeding patterns. RESULTS: Combining data from all hospitals, breastfeeding initiation increased postintervention from 58.5 to 64.7 percent (p = 0.02). An overall increase in exclusive breastfeeding rates was not statistically significant. In multivariate logistic regression for all hospitals combined, infants born postintervention were significantly more likely to initiate breastfeeding than infants born preintervention (adjusted OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03-1.69). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive breastfeeding education for health care practitioners can increase breastfeeding initiation rates.",M2
19262945,"Self-medication in nursing mothers and its influence on the duration of breastfeeding.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the practice of self-medication by nursing mothers, the main drugs used and the influence on the duration of breastfeeding. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study involving 246 women seen at the maternity unit of Hospital Manoel Gonçalves in Itaúna, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A monthly follow-up of mothers and newborns was performed for the first 12 months postpartum or until weaning. The effect of the practice of self-medication on the duration of breastfeeding was evaluated by multivariate analysis using Cox's regression model with time-dependent variables. RESULTS: Self-medication was practiced by 52.4% of the nursing mothers. The most used pharmacological classes were: analgesics/antipyretics (54.5%), non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (15%), spasmolytics (6.2%), laxatives (3.5%), benzodiazepines (3%), nasal decongestants (1.4%), and antibiotics (0.9%). The most used drugs were dipyrone (31.5%) and paracetamol (17.9%). The practice of self-medication was associated with a higher probability of the use of drugs posing the risk of adverse effects for the infant or for <e>lactation</e> (p = 0.000). However, the practice of self-medication was not associated with weaning (p = 0.135). CONCLUSIONS: The high rates of self-medication among nursing mothers and the use of drugs posing risks of undesirable effects for the infant and for lactation reveal the need for better education on the risks of self-medication by nursing mothers. However, self-medication was not proven to be a risk factor for weaning.",M2
19259990,"Nipple preference and contests in suckling kittens of the domestic cat are unrelated to presumed nipple quality.We studied the development of suckling behavior and weight gain in 11 litters (52 kittens) of free-ranging domestic cats until postnatal day 28 just before the start of weaning. In six of these litters, we also recorded milk intake and contests for access to nipples. Already within 12 hr of birth kittens showed a preference for posterior nipples, and by postnatal day 3 each had developed a preference for particular nipples. In fact, 86% of kittens used one particular nipple most often, and even when the mother changed the side she lay on to nurse. Contests for access to nipples occurred throughout the study period at an average rate of one to two contests per kitten per hour of nursing. Contrary to suggestions in the literature that kittens compete for more productive nipples, we found no relation between kittens' use of particular nipples and their weight gain, milk intake, or involvement in contests during suckling. We suggest that kittens' preference for posterior nipples as well as their establishment of an individual  teat order  might function to optimize the number of nipples remaining productive across <e>lactation</e>, and to reduce energetically costly scrambles and potentially injurious contests among littermates.",M2
19245535,"A nationwide study on hospital admissions due to dehydration in exclusively breastfed infants in the Netherlands: its incidence, clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome.AIMS: To estimate the incidence and clinical characteristics in hospital admissions due to dehydration or undernutrition and their laboratory evaluation and treatment outcome in exclusively breastfed infants. METHODS: All hospital admissions during the first 3 months of life assessed by the Dutch Paediatric Surveillance Unit (DPSU) between mid 2003 and mid 2005. RESULTS: Nationwide 158 cases reported, correspond to an incidence of 58/y/100,000 breastfed infants; it is lower for severe dehydration at risk for hypernatraemia; 20/y/100,000. Sixty-five per cent of cases were &lt;2 weeks old, their median weight loss was 9.3% and median age at admission 5 days; Serum sodium value was measured in only 12% of all cases. Insufficient volume intake and inadequate growth were most frequently reported (61% and 41%). Lethargy, jaundice or clinical dehydration was scored in 11-25%, seizures or shock in 3%. A breast pump at home was used in only 31%. In the hospital breast pumps were available (82%) as <e>lactation</e> consultants (73%). For treatment 65% was offered formula, in 30% by nasogastric drip. Most admissions lasted up to 3 days, all recovered fully and 33% were breastfed exclusively at discharge. CONCLUSION: The incidence of severe dehydration in the Netherlands is relatively low. With extended use of breast pumps at home it could be lower. To prevent complications, we recommend applying a reference weight chart, a full clinical examination and more extensive screening of serum sodium and glucose.",M2
19239405,"Effectiveness of exclusive breastfeeding promotion in low-income mothers: a randomized controlled study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a breastfeeding promotion program in the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition Program participants. STUDY DESIGN: This randomized clinical trial included 52 women in the intervention group who received one-to-one pre- and postnatal breastfeeding education and support from a <e>lactation</e> consultant. Women (n = 52) randomized to controls received standard breastfeeding services. Data regarding their infants' feeding (classified as exclusive, partial, and bottle) during the first 7 days, 1, 2, and 3 months of age were compared. Additionally, the mothers were surveyed to assess their knowledge, attitude, and beliefs regarding breastfeeding. RESULTS: Among the 104 enrolled women, 91 (87.5%) were Hispanic. Almost all the pregnant women had planned to breastfeed their infants. Although the majority of women reported breastfeeding their infants, 45.6% in the intervention group and 28.9% of controls practiced exclusive breastfeeding during the first 7 days. By 3 months, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the intervention and control groups had dropped to 13.9% and 10.5%, respectively. Parity, mode of delivery, previous experience with breastfeeding, rooming in, and return to work did not significantly affect the exclusive breastfeeding rate. Maternal knowledge, attitude, and beliefs regarding breastfeeding were comparable between the study groups at the baseline stage as well as 3 months postpartum. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in the proposed breastfeeding promotion program by the low-income mothers was associated with an insignificant increase in the exclusive breastfeeding rate during the first 3 postpartum months.",M2
19177060,"Systems changes to prevent severe hyperbilirubinemia and promote breastfeeding: pilot approaches.Providing safe and effective care requires coordination among the multiple levels of the health care system. These levels comprise the newborn (patient, family and community), nursery or primary care practice (microsystem), hospital or managed care organization (macro-organization) and policy, payment or regulatory issues (environmental context). Contemporary care practices associated with childbirth and early newborn care often reflect disruptions in coordination of these processes and place newborns at risk for poor outcomes. For example, with routine early postpartum discharge, often at less than 48 h after vaginal birth, the peak of serum bilirubin at 3 to 5 days of age typically occurs at home, rather than observed by clinicians in a newborn nursery. In addition, <e>lactation</e> is rarely well established by early discharge and support is often inadequate, increasing the risk of hyperbilirubinemia and discontinuation of breastfeeding. Also, late preterm infants are frequently cared for in the newborn nursery, although they often have difficulty establishing oral feeding and are at substantially higher risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia than infants born at term. Finally, pediatric follow-up is often delayed beyond the first week, after the optimal time for continued assessment of jaundice and lactation. The American Academy of Pediatrics Safe and Healthy Beginnings Initiative, a pilot quality improvement project, will target newborn nurseries, primary care practices and coordination between these sites using a systems-based approach to facilitate implementation of the 2004 guideline for management of hyperbilirubinemia.",M2
19196036,"Breastfeeding knowledge, attitudes, and practices among providers in a medical home.OBJECTIVE: Breastfeeding offers numerous health advantages to children, mothers, and society. From obstetrics to pediatrics, breastfeeding dyads come in contact with a wide range of healthcare providers. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) calls for pediatricians to support breastfeeding enthusiastically and for all children to have a medical home. We studied an inner-city healthcare system with a Dyson Community Pediatrics Training Initiative Model Medical Home clinic, to explore how a breastfeeding/baby-friendly medical home might be built upon this framework. We describe breastfeeding knowledge, attitudes, and practices among a full range of providers and healthcare system-level barriers to effective and coordinated breastfeeding services. METHODS: We conducted eight focus groups using semistructured interviews: (1) pediatricians; (2) obstetricians; (3) pediatric nurses and allied health professionals; (4) obstetric nurses and allied health professionals; (5) 24-hour telephone triage answering service nurses; (6) public health nurses; (7) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) personnel; and (8) <e>lactation</e> consultants and peer counselors. RESULTS: We identified gaps in providers' breastfeeding knowledge, counseling skills, and professional education and training. Providers' cultures and attitudes affect breastfeeding promotion and support. Providers used their own breastfeeding experiences to replace evidence-based knowledge and AAP policy statement recommendations for breastfeeding dyads. There were communication disconnects between provider groups. Providers underestimated their own, and overestimated others', influence on breastfeeding. The system lacked a coordinated breastfeeding mission. CONCLUSIONS: This study illuminated key disconnectedness challenges (and, hence, opportunities) for a model medical home in fostering continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, culturally effective, and evidence-based breastfeeding promotion and support.",M2
19178785,"The possible role of human milk nucleotides as sleep inducers.Breast-milk contains a potent mixture of diverse components, such as the non-protein nitrogen fraction which includes nucleotides, whose variation in levels is evident throughout <e>lactation</e>. In addition, these substances play an important role in sleep homeostasis. In the present study, human milk samples were analyzed using a capillary electrophoresis system. The rhythmicity of each nucleotide was studied by cosinor analysis. It was found that the nucleotides 5'AMP, 5'GMP, 5'CMP, and 5'IMP have significant (P &lt; 0.05) circadian rhythms, the acrophases of the first two being during the night, and of the latter two during the day. While 5'UMP did not show a clear circadian rhythm, there was an increase in its levels at night. In conclusion, the rise in nocturnal levels of 5'AMP, 5'GMP, and 5'UMP could be involved in inducing the 'hypnotic' action of breast-milk at night in the infant.",M2
19155428,"Vitamin D supplementation during <e>lactation</e> to support infant and mother.How human milk as the ideal infant nutrition lacks vitamin D activity leading to the severe bony deformities and muscle weakness of rickets has stymied scientists and clinicians for centuries. Recent understanding of human vitamin D requirements based on functional indicators of vitamin D activity demonstrate that the majority of humans, including lactating mothers, subsist in a vitamin D insufficient state. In this state, human milk provides inadequate vitamin D supply to the nursing infant. In contrast, with achieving maternal vitamin D sufficiency, human milk attains vitamin D activity equivalent to present infant oral supplementation. Current investigation of the role of vitamin D in diseases beyond bone health is revealing the significance of early life vitamin D sufficiency in establishing lifelong health.",M2
19148114,"Attitudes of NICU professionals regarding feeding blood-tinged colostrum or milk.OBJECTIVE: Mothers of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients sometimes bring expressed milk that is blood tinged to the NICU. In certain instances, the blood contamination appears minimal, whereas in others, the milk is quite dark pink. We have observed inconsistencies in practice regarding whether or not to feed blood-tinged colostrum or milk to NICU patients. We know of no evidence that establishes best practice in this area, and thus we sought to determine attitudes of NICU professionals on which to base a potentially best practice. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a web-based anonymous survey of attitudes of NICU professionals at Intermountain Healthcare regarding feeding blood-tinged expressed milk to NICU patients. These professionals included neonatologists, neonatal nurse practitioners, NICU nurses, NICU dieticians and <e>lactation</e> consultants. RESULT:Survey results were returned from 64% (426 of 667) of those to whom it was sent. A total of 75% of respondents reported that their practice was NOT to feed the blood-tinged milk illustrated in the figure as sample 2, and nearly all respondents (98%) reported that they would NOT feed the milk illustrated as sample 3. The majority of the neonatologists (56%) and the lactation consultants (58%) recommended feeding moderately bloody milk (sample 2), whereas only 22% of the neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs), NICU nurses and NICU dieticians recommended feeding such samples (&lt;0.001). The most frequently selected reason for NOT feeding blood-tinged milk was that it would likely cause gastrointestinal upset and feeding intolerance (selected by 77%). The majority (87%) overestimated the amount of blood contaminating a milk sample (sample 3). CONCLUSION: As colostrum and human milk feedings can be of value to NICU patients, evidence should be assembled to document whether feeding blood-tinged samples indeed have the problems listed by the survey respondents. Such evidence is needed to enable informed decisions involving the benefits vs risks of feeding blood-tinged expressed milk to NICU patients.",M2
19141141,"The relationship between breast milk leptin and neonatal weight gain.AIM: To investigate whether change in leptin content of breast milk during <e>lactation</e> acts on neonatal body weight gain. METHODS: In total 15 lactating women and their 15 term infants were involved in the study. Breast milk and neonatal serum samples were obtained from the same women and their neonates on the 1st day and any day between the 21st and 30th days after birth. Breast milk and serum leptin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Anthropometric indexes of the infants were recorded. RESULTS: The study was completed with 15 multiparious mothers aged 19-37 years and their infants. The mean collection time of the first samples after birth was 6.07 +/- 1.94 h. The leptin level in the mature milk was significantly higher than in the colostrum (p &lt; 0.001). Neonatal weight and height were significantly increased on 21-30 lactation days compared to 1st day of lactation (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The leptin concentration in the mature milk was negatively correlated with delta BMI (r =-0.53; p &lt; 0.05). The delta breast milk leptin concentration was also found to be inversely correlated with delta BMI (r =-0.529; p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study have suggested that change in the leptin content of breast milk during lactation might play a role in the regulation of weight gain in healthy neonates.",M2
19133399,"The benefits of phone support and home visits: an evaluation of the City of Kingston's Breastfeeding Support Service.This paper presents an evaluation of the City of Kingston Breastfeeding Support Service that was performed in 2006. The evaluation utilised a mail-out questionnaire designed to investigate mothers' breastfeeding expectations, experiences, issues and support received, in addition to their experience of using the Service. Seventy-seven percent of mothers contacted the service for support due primarily to problems with positioning and attachment, nipple pain or mastitis. Other reasons were also cited, reflecting that it takes time and experience for women to learn to breastfeed and to develop an understanding of their <e>lactation</e>. The study found that on discharge from the hospital, 59% of mothers were fully breastfeeding; this figure decreased to 32% at the time of contacting the service, but increased to 42% two weeks after contacting the service. Satisfaction with both the model of service and the support received was very high. Mothers were able to feel more comfortable with their breastfeeding (75%), to breastfeed for longer (59%) and with more confidence (71%) and greater knowledge (68%) about breastfeeding and lactation. The majority of mothers (96%) reported they would contact the service again if they needed further breastfeeding advice and support.",M2

Maternal diet influences milk DHA, whereas milk AA seems rather constant. We investigated milk AA, DHA and DHA/AA after supplementation of AA plus DHA, or DHA alone during pregnancy and lactation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Women were supplemented with AA+DHA (220mg each/day), DHA (220mg/day) or placebo during pregnancy and lactation. Milk samples were collected at 2 (n=86) and 12 weeks (n=69) postpartum. RESULTS: Supplementation of AA+DHA elevated milk AA (week 2, 14%; week 12, 23%) and DHA (43% and 52%) as compared to placebo. DHA tended to decrease milk AA and vice versa. Milk AA, DHA and DHA/AA decreased from 2 to 12 weeks postpartum. CONCLUSIONS: Milk AA and in particular DHA are sensitive to maternal supplementation. It seems that maternal AA and notably DHA status decline with advancing lactation.",M2
19104374,"Medications in pregnancy and <e>lactation</e>: part 1. Teratology.One of the least-developed areas of clinical pharmacology and drug research is the use of medication during pregnancy and lactation. This article is the first in a two-part series designed to familiarize physicians with many aspects of the drugs they commonly prescribe for pregnant and breast-feeding women. Almost every pregnant woman is exposed to some type of medication during pregnancy. Although the majority of pregnant and breast-feeding women consume clinically indicated or over-the-counter drug preparation regularly, only few medications have specifically been tested for safety and efficacy during pregnancy. There is scant information on the effect of common pregnancy complications on drug clearance and efficacy. Often, the safety of a drug for mothers, their fetuses, and nursing infants cannot be determined until it has been widely used. Absent this crucial information, many women are either refused medically important agents or experience potentially harmful delays in receiving drug treatment. Conversely, many drugs deemed  safe  are prescribed despite evidence of possible teratogenicity. Novel research and diagnostic applications evolving from the opportunities presented by the advances in genomics and proteomics are now beginning to affect clinical diagnosis, vaccine development, drug discovery, and unique therapies in a modern diagnostic-therapeutic framework-part of the new scientific field of theranostics. This review critically explores a number of recently raised issues in regard to the use of several classes of medications during gestation and seeks to provide a general and concise resource on drugs commonly used during pregnancy and lactation. It also seeks to make clinicians more aware of the controversies surrounding some drugs in an effort to encourage safer prescribing practices through consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and through references and Web sites that list up-to-date information.",M2

Twenty-two percent of workplaces and 17% of schools did not provide a lactation room. Although part- or full-time status, knowledge of breastfeeding rules, and support from colleagues were independently associated with the outcome, they were not significant in the multivariate analysis. In the selected model, maternal age (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3; 1.3-3.9 for a 10-year difference), college or above versus &lt;or= high school education (OR = 9.1; 4.2-19.6), and exclusive breast milk feeding in the hospital (OR = 2.1; 1.1-4.0) were associated with better breastfeeding outcomes at 6 months postpartum. Receipt of discharge gift packs containing formula (OR = 0.5; 0.3-1.0) was inversely associated with the degree of breastfeeding exclusivity. The 2 latter findings underscore the importance of hospitals adhering to specific guidelines of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative.",M2
19051846,"Integrating <e>lactation</e> consultants into primary health care services: are lactation consultants affecting breastfeeding success?This integrative literature review describes the educational background, clinical training, and certification process of the International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC). The evidence for use or non-use of IBCLCs in breastfeeding support in the primary care setting and in the care of early parenting families is presented. Medline, PsychInfo, CINAHL, and Google Scholar were searched for research related to IBCLCs. The search was limited to research that studied the use vs. non-use of IBCLCs in outpatient settings and excluded studies that were solely conducted in the hospital environment. This search yielded five studies comparing IBCLC use vs. nonuse in outpatient settings. Study authors suggested a positive correlation between IBCLC use and breastfeeding duration; however, the reliability and validity of the outcomes of these studies could not be ascertained due, in part, to small homogenous sample sizes and other limitations of study design. More research regarding IBCLC use in primary care settings is needed. Limited data available suggest that IBCLCs may promote a longer duration of breastfeeding postpartum when utilized in primary care settings.",M2

The To evaluate the effectiveness of a strategy on breastfeeding promotion to the Family Health Program team. METHODS: A controlled intervention study was performed with 20 family health care teams randomly selected into intervention and control group in Montes Claros, Southeastern Brazil, in 2006. The teams randomly selected into intervention and control group, and the intervention group took part in a 24-hour training program on breastfeeding promotion for health providers, modeled on the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. It was emphasized health provider's support for breastfeeding and management of major <e>lactation</e> problems. The control group received routine breastfeeding training. Mothers of all children under two cared by the teams were interviewed at home before (n=1,423) and 12 months after the intervention (n=1,491) and answered questions about breastfeeding practices. Survival curves of breastfeeding were plotted and compared for both time points studied using the log rank test. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in exclusive breastfeeding after the educational activities for the Family Health Program teams. Survival curves of exclusive breastfeeding at the fi rst time point studied showed no statistical significance difference between the groups by log rank test (p=0.502). After the intervention, survival curves of exclusive breastfeeding were significantly different by the log rank test (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The training of Family Health Program teams as proposed by the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative proved to be an effective, low-cost strategy for raising awareness among health providers, providing consistent information, and assuring the required support to mothers with breastfeeding issues.",M2
19005338,"American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations on the effects of early nutritional interventions on the development of atopic disease.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the American Academy of Pediatrics statement on the effects of early nutritional interventions on the development of atopic disease in infants and children. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings suggest that restriction of maternal diet during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> does not play a major role in the development of allergic disease. In high-risk infants, exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 months prevents or delays atopic dermatitis, cow milk allergy, and wheezing early in life. There is evidence that supplementing breastfeeding with a hydrolyzed formula protects against atopic disease, especially atopic dermatitis in at-risk infants. Finally, there is little evidence that delaying the introduction of complementary foods beyond 4-6 months of age has any protective effect against allergy. There is insufficient data that any dietary intervention beyond 4-6 months of age has any protective effect against developing atopic disease. SUMMARY: In high-risk infants, there is evidence that exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 months, and delaying of complementary foods until 4-6 months, prevent the development of allergy. There is some evidence that supplementing hydrolyzed formulas in high-risk infants may delay or prevent allergic disease. There is no convincing evidence that maternal manipulation of diet during pregnancy or lactation, use of soy products, or infant dietary restrictions beyond 4-6 months has any effect on the development of atopic disease.",M2
18998524,"Workplace <e>lactation</e> program: a nursing friendly initiative.The U.S. is experiencing a nursing shortage that is threatening its quality of healthcare. One contributing factor that has been identified is the level of dissatisfaction that nurses have with their working conditions. Health Services Organizations can use female and family friendly initiatives, such as workplace lactation programs to demonstrate that they are willing to support a female employee's task of balancing familial and profession roles. By meeting the needs of breastfeeding mothers, organizations can have a positive impact on employees' levels of satisfaction, which can positively impact recruitment efforts, productivity and retention.",M2
18987605,"Drugs during <e>lactation</e> accenting boron exposure.OBJECTIVES: The benefits of breastfeeding are generally accepted. Risk of drug usage for baby due to lactation is well assessed minimally in certain cases. However, information given about drugs are often insufficient, frustrating, and not recommending lactation. In Czech Teratology Information Service (CZTIS) counselling we use these information. RESULTS: We have given advice in 58 cases inquiring the CZTIS about the risk of drug exposure during lactation. The most frequent queries were on chronic disease treatment following the drug exposure during pregnancy. Remaining cases were associated with acute infections. Mothers suffered from idiopathic bowel disease and psychiatric patients want to be informed before delivery about possibility to breastfeed their babies. Treatment of epilepsy, another frequent disease, is associated with better level of knowledge of both, neurologists and patients. Breastfeeding is recommended according to management in care of epileptic women. CONCLUSION: In our counselling we consider the factors which are involved in drug transfer in the milk and mechanisms and steps of transfer as well. We follow the classification of drugs during lactation by their effect on infants: absolutely contraindicated, temporary cessation of breastfeeding, drugs of special concern and drugs compatible with breastfeeding.",M2
18956963,"Influence of sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics on breastfeeding duration of mothers attending breastfeeding support groups.AIM: Duration of breastfeeding, socio-demographic and psychosocial characteristics of the mothers attending breastfeeding support groups were investigated. METHODS: All examined mothers were cared for according to the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) of the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. The investigated group of mothers attended a breastfeeding support group (BSG) led by a community nurse and women experienced in breastfeeding without additional training. Data on breastfeeding duration were collected retrospectively by self-reported questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 980 eligible, 393 mothers were included to the study: 210 attended BSG, while 183 did not. The following differences between the two groups were found: time when the decision to breastfeed was made, smoking during <e>lactation</e> and social support while breastfeeding. More mothers in the investigated group continued breastfeeding at least six months postnatal (83.8% vs. 48.1%, P&lt;0.001), with exclusive breastfeeding until the age of three months (56% vs. 23.5%, P&lt;0.001). After logistic regression analysis, the following factors were found to be positively associated with the duration of breastfeeding for at least six months: time when the decision to breastfeed was made, intended duration of breastfeeding and household income. Maternal smoking during pregnancy affected duration of breastfeeding inversely. CONCLUSION: Characteristics which positively influenced the duration of breastfeeding are the time when the decision to breastfeed was made, intended duration of breastfeeding, household income, and smoking during pregnancy. Mothers who attended BSG more often continued breastfeeding for at least six months if they decided to breastfeed after birth, intended to breastfeed for longer than six months, had higher monthly household income and did not smoke during pregnancy.",M2
18829834,"Why mothers stop breastfeeding: mothers' self-reported reasons for stopping during the first year.OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to determine why women stop breastfeeding at various times during their infant's first year. METHODS: We analyzed self-reported data from 1323 mothers who participated in the Infant Feeding Practice Study II. Mail questionnaires were sent to mothers approximately 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 1/2, and 12 months after their child's birth, in which they were asked to rate the importance of 32 reasons for their decision to stop breastfeeding. We applied exploratory factorial analysis to extract meaningful constructs of mothers' responses to the 32 reasons. We then compared the percentages of mothers who indicated that each reason was important in their decision to stop breastfeeding among various weaning ages and used multiple logistic regression models to examine sociodemographic differences in the most frequently cited reasons for stopping breastfeeding. RESULTS: The perception that their infant was not satisfied by breast milk alone was cited consistently as 1 of the top 3 reasons in the mothers' decision to stop breastfeeding regardless of weaning age (43.5%-55.6%) and was even more frequent among Hispanic mothers and mothers with annual household incomes of &lt;350% of the federal poverty level. Mothers' concerns about <e>lactation</e> and nutrition issues were the most frequently cited reasons for stopping breastfeeding during the first 2 months. Starting from the third month, self-weaning reasons were increasingly cited as important, with the statements  My baby began to bite  (31.7%),  My baby lost interest in nursing or began to wean himself or herself  (47.3%), and  Breast milk alone did not satisfy my baby  (43.5%) cited as the top 3 reasons at &gt; or = 9 months of age. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings about the major reasons why mothers stop breastfeeding at various times during their child's first year should be useful to health professionals when attempting to help mothers overcome breastfeeding barriers and to health officials attempting to devise targeted breastfeeding interventions on those issues prominent for each infant age.",M2
18821003,"Knowledge about breastfeeding among a group of primary care physicians and residents in Puerto Rico.Physicians have an essential role in promoting, protecting, and supporting breastfeeding as the ideal method of infant feeding. They are in an important position to promote breastfeeding but report difficulty in advising mothers with <e>lactation</e> problems. The purpose of this study is to assess knowledge about breastfeeding among primary care physicians and residents and identify potential barriers to its promotion. One hundred seventy-seven residents and physicians answered an anonymous questionnaire. The participants recognized breastfeeding benefits but 26% did not encourage exclusive breastfeeding. Mastitis, breast abscess, and the use of medications by the mother were considered contraindications to breastfeeding. Temporary breastfeeding discontinuation and bilirubin levels measurement were the preferred recommendations for the jaundiced infant. Most physicians received training in breastfeeding benefits although they report fair knowledge in myths, techniques, and contraindications. Physicians demonstrated to recognize breastfeeding benefits, but formal education is needed to eliminate barriers to breastfeeding promotion and support.",M2
18819238,"Management of mastitis in breastfeeding women.Mastitis occurs in approximately 10 percent of U.S. mothers who are breastfeeding, and it can lead to the cessation of breastfeeding. The risk of mastitis can be reduced by frequent, complete emptying of the breast and by optimizing breastfeeding technique. Sore nipples can precipitate mastitis. The differential diagnosis of sore nipples includes mechanical irritation from a poor latch or infant mouth anomalies, such as cleft palate or bacterial or yeast infection. The diagnosis of mastitis is usually clinical, with patients presenting with focal tenderness in one breast accompanied by fever and malaise. Treatment includes changing breastfeeding technique, often with the assistance of a <e>lactation</e> consultant. When antibiotics are needed, those effective against Staphylococcus aureus (e.g., dicloxacillin, cephalexin) are preferred. As methicillin-resistant S. aureus becomes more common, it is likely to be a more common cause of mastitis, and antibiotics that are effective against this organism may become preferred. Continued breastfeeding should be encouraged in the presence of mastitis and generally does not pose a risk to the infant. Breast abscess is the most common complication of mastitis. It can be prevented by early treatment of mastitis and continued breastfeeding. Once an abscess occurs, surgical drainage or needle aspiration is needed. Breastfeeding can usually continue in the presence of a treated abscess.",M2
18758336,"Prenatal breastfeeding education and breastfeeding outcomes.PURPOSE: To examine the impact of various breastfeeding outcomes of three cohorts receiving different methods of prenatal breastfeeding education. METHODS: Retrospective cohort design with patients attending a breastfeeding education class at an Army medical center. Controls were matched for sponsor rank, marital status, and smoking status. One hundred ninety-four mothers who expressed intent to breastfeed received breastfeeding education as follows: (a) a class that used video demonstration and group teaching by a <e>lactation</e> consultant, (b) a new mothers' support group with one-on-one teaching prenatally and weekly meetings postpartum, taught by a lactation consultant and a pediatrician, and (c) a control group educated at prenatal visits only. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, ANOVA, unpaired t test, and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Women who attended prenatal breastfeeding classes had significantly increased breastfeeding at 6 months when compared to controls (p = .01). There was no significant difference in rates between types of classes offered (p = .45). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Prenatal breastfeeding education can influence the amount of time women breastfeed. All providers of prenatal care should consider offering such classes in order to improve breastfeeding rates.",M2
18697506,"Strategies for breastfeeding success.Breastfeeding provides significant health benefits for infants and mothers. However, the United States continues to fall short of the breastfeeding goals set by the Healthy People 2010 initiative. The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology have policy statements supporting breastfeeding that reflect recent advancements in understanding the mechanisms underlying the benefits of breastfeeding and in the clinical management of breastfeeding. Despite popular belief, there are few contraindications to breastfeeding. Providing maternal support and structured antenatal and postpartum breastfeeding education are the most effective means of achieving breastfeeding success. In addition, immediate skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant and early initiation of breastfeeding are shown to improve breastfeeding outcomes. When concerns about <e>lactation</e> arise during newborn visits, the infant must be carefully assessed for jaundice, weight loss, and signs of failure to thrive. If a work-up is required, parents should be supported in their decision to breastfeed. Certified lactation consultants can provide valuable support and education to patients. Physicians should educate working women who breastfeed about the availability of breast pumps and the proper storage of expressed breast milk. Physicians must be aware of their patients' lactation status when prescribing medications, as some may affect milk supply or be unsafe for breastfeeding infants. Through support and encouragement of breastfeeding, national breastfeeding goals can be met.",M2
18631440,"Breast-feeding and diabetes: long-term impact on mothers and their infants.In the general population, breast-feeding is associated with a reduced risk of the offspring being overweight later in life by 22% to 24% across the age spectrum, from preschool children to adults. There is a dose-response gradient with increasing duration of breast-feeding, and lowest risk with prolonged, exclusive breast-feeding. Breast-feeding has been shown to slow infant growth up to 2 years of age. By contrast, the scientific evidence is inconclusive about whether breast-feeding protects against the onset of overweight and subsequent development of type 2 diabetes among offspring whose mothers had diabetes during pregnancy. Moreover, evidence is insufficient to determine if <e>lactation</e> protects against development of type 2 diabetes later in life in women with a diabetes history during pregnancy. Given the paucity of the evidence and equivocal findings about the long-term effects of breast-feeding on future health of women with diabetes during pregnancy and their infants, further research is recommended.",M2

18629310,"Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling of persistent organic pollutants for lifetime exposure assessment: a new tool in breast cancer epidemiologic studies.BACKGROUND: Despite experimental evidence, most epidemiologic studies to date have not supported an association between exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POP) and breast cancer incidence in humans. This may be attributable to difficulties in estimating blood/tissue POP concentration at critical time periods of carcinogenesis. OBJECTIVES: In this work we aimed to develop a tool to estimate lifetime POP blood/tissue exposure and levels during any hypothesized time window of susceptibility in breast cancer development. METHODS: We developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that can account for any given physiologic lifetime history. Using data on pregnancies, height, weight, and age, the model estimates the values of physiologic parameters (e.g., organ volume, composition, and blood flow) throughout a woman's entire life. We assessed the lifetime toxicokinetic profile (LTP) for various exposure scenarios and physiologic factors (i.e., breast-feeding, growth, pregnancy, <e>lactation</e>, and weight changes). RESULTS: Simulations for three POPs [hexachlorobenzene, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-153, PCB-180] using different lifetime physiologic profiles showed that the same blood concentration at 55 years of age can be reached despite totally different LTP. Aside from exposure levels, lactation periods and weight profile history were shown to be the factors that had the greatest impact on the LTP. CONCLUSIONS: This new lifetime PBPK model, which showed the limitations of using a single sample value obtained around the time of diagnosis for lifetime exposure assessment, will enable researchers conducting environmental epidemiology studies to reduce uncertainty linked to past POP exposure estimation and to consider exposure during time windows that are hypothesized to be mechanistically critical in carcinogenesis.",M2

AIM: The study examined the growth of 82 breastfed children, and maternal fish consumption (hair mercury concentrations, HHg) during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e>. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fish consumption in mothers and children was estimated through HHg. The children were measured and weighed at birth and at 6 (exclusive breastfeeding), 36 and 60 months. RESULTS: Fish consumption rate (HHg) had no significant impact on children's growth at the specified ages (p = 0.35). After 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding, children had the highest proportion of Z-scores &lt;-1 SD; however, weaning (with extended breastfeeding) had a substantial impact in moving up the attained growth at 3 years. The duration of breastfeeding was significantly correlated with attained Z-scores for weight-for-age (r = 0.26; p = 0.02) and weight-for-height (r = 0.22; p = 0.04) but not for height-for-age. At 3 years most children had improved Z-scores (&gt;-1 SD) for height-for-age (70/82), weight-for-age (74/82) and weight-for-height (74/82). At 5 years, all but one child attained Z-scores &gt;-1.

18589033,"Validation of a short questionnaire to assess mothers' perception of workplace breastfeeding support.The purpose of this study was to create and establish the validity of a short questionnaire to measure mothers' perceived support for breastfeeding from the workplace. The items in the workplace breastfeeding support scale (WBSS) were derived from a literature review. The scale was self-administered in central Indiana during the fall of 2005 to a convenience sample of 66 volunteers who were primiparous, 6 to 12 months postpartum, worked outside home, and had initiated breastfeeding prior to the survey. Internal consistency (alpha) and split-half reliability (r) tests and a factor analysis were done to establish reliability and construct validity of the scale. The WBSS showed acceptable reliability (alpha=.77, r=0.86). Content validity was established by review using a panel of experts. Four distinct constructs of the scale were identified that accounted for 62.1% of the total variability of the scale: technical, environmental, facility, and peer support, thus establishing construct validity of the scale. <e>Lactation</e> consultants and worksite lactation program planners can use the WBSS to help mothers returning to work and to assess the needs for improvement of support programs.",M2

18551096,"Breastfeeding-related maternity practices at hospitals and birth centers--United States, 2007.Breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition for infants and is associated with decreased risk for infant and maternal morbidity and mortality; however, only four states (Alaska, Montana, Oregon, and Washington) have met all five Healthy People 2010 targets for breastfeeding. Maternity practices in hospitals and birth centers throughout the intrapartum period, such as ensuring mother-newborn skin-to-skin contact, keeping mother and newborn together, and not giving supplemental feedings to breastfed newborns unless medically indicated, can influence breastfeeding behaviors during a period critical to successful establishment of <e>lactation</e>. In 2007, to characterize maternity practices related to breastfeeding, CDC conducted the first national Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) Survey. This report summarizes results of that survey, which indicated that 1) a substantial proportion of facilities used maternity practices that are not evidence-based and are known to interfere with breastfeeding and 2) states in the southern United States generally had lower mPINC scores, including certain states previously determined to have the lowest 6-month breastfeeding rates.

18546573,"Alcohol, pregnancy and breastfeeding; a comparison of the 1995 and 2001 National Health Survey data.Alcohol enters breastmilk by passive diffusion and levels are reflected in maternal blood within 30 to 60 minutes of ingestion. If not timed appropriately, drinking alcohol throughout the period of <e>lactation</e> can negatively impact on lactation performance and the mental development of the infant. The aim of this study was to explore the drinking patterns of pregnant, lactating and other Australian women of child bearing age using the 1995 and 2001 National Health Survey Confidentialised Unit Record Files. Alcohol consumption was categorised according to Guideline 11 from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) current Australian Alcohol Guidelines, which state that if pregnant or lactating women choose to drink, over a week, they should have fewer than 7 standard drinks. Despite a low intake by most pregnant and lactating women from both surveys, approximately 16.4% and 1.3% (95% Confidence Interval (CI 7.0-23.2) of pregnant women from the 1995 and 2001 NHS respectively, and 13% and 16.8% (95% CI -6.5 - -1.1) of lactating mothers from the 1995 NHS and 2001 NHS respectively, were drinking above this national guideline. There were significantly more pregnant women in the 1995 NHS, and lactating women in the 20091 NHS, exceeding this recommendation. Pregnancy and lactation are vulnerable times of infant growth and development. There is a definite need in Australia for improved antenatal, and maternal and child health programs that address this significant public health issue.",M2
18546572,"Long-term breastfeeding; changing attitudes and overcoming challenges.The experiences of 107 Australian women who were breastfeeding a child two years or older were gathered via a written questionnaire with open-ended questions. Eighty-seven percent of women had not originally intended to breastfeed long-term and many had initially felt disgust for breastfeeding beyond infancy. Mothers changed their opinion about long-term breastfeeding as they saw their child enjoy breastfeeding, as their knowledge about breastfeeding increased and as they were exposed to long-term breastfeeding role models. It was common for mothers to be shocked the first time they saw a non-infant breastfeed but this exposure was also a part of the process by which they came to consider continuing to breastfeed themselves. Women often found long-term breastfeeding role models as well as information and moral support for breastfeeding continuance within a peer breastfeeding support organisation (the Australian Breastfeeding Association). Previous breastfeeding experiences had assisted women in their current breastfeeding relationship. Mothers had overcome many challenges in order to continue breastfeeding and breastfeeding was sometimes discontinuous, with children weaning from days to years before resuming breastfeeding. This study suggests that postnatal interventions may be successful in increasing breastfeeding duration. Such interventions might include: continuing provision of breastfeeding information throughout the <e>lactation</e> period, facilitation of exposure to long-term breastfeeding, and referral to peer breastfeeding support organisations.",M2
18515021,"Current management of transitional feeding issues in preterm neonates born in Queensland, Australia.BACKGROUND: Many preterm neonates display difficulty establishing suck-feeding competence in the weeks following birth. Ineffective management of transitional feeding issues may cause patient complications, and can contribute to increased length of stay. AIMS: Given that many neonatal nurseries appear to vary in their neonatal feeding management practices, the aim of this study was to investigate and document the routine level of support and intervention currently provided for preterm neonates with transitional feeding issues across the various level II (special care) nurseries (SCNs) in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to all Queensland SCNs in 2005 (n=36). The questionnaire contained a series of closed-choice and short-answer questions designed to obtain information from each SCN regarding their current practices for managing transitional feeding issues in preterm neonates. Results were confirmed during a follow-up phone call. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 29 SCNs (80.6%). None of these nurseries reported having any formal, written policies regarding the management of transitional feeding issues in preterm neonates. Wide variations were reported in relation to the suck-feeding assessments and interventions used by staff within the various SCNs. Of the 29 nurseries, 4 (13.8%) reported using checklists or assessments to judge readiness for suck-feeds, and 5 (17.2%) reported using pulse oximetry to judge tolerance of suck-feeding attempts. Eighteen SCNs (62.1%) reported offering some form of active intervention to assist neonates with transitional feeding issues, with the most common intervention techniques reported being non-nutritive sucking during tube feeds, pre-feeding oral stimulation, and actively pacing suck-feeds. Twenty-two SCNs (75.4%) reported having access to a <e>lactation</e> consultant to assist mothers with breastfeeding issues. CONCLUSIONS: Differences were reported in the routine management of transitional feeding issues in preterm neonates across the various SCNs in Queensland. It is suggested that evidence based guidelines need to be developed, and that, in order to do this, further research studies are required to determine current best practice, as well as to answer remaining questions.",M2
18489617,"Infants of mothers with persistent nipple pain exert strong sucking vacuums.AIM: The objective of this study was to determine whether infants of mothers experiencing persistent nipple pain exerted very strong intraoral vacuums during a breastfeed. METHODS: Thirty mothers experiencing persistent pain during breastfeeding (Pain group; infants aged 49.4 +/- 35.5 days) were compared to 30 successfully breastfeeding mothers (Control group; infants aged 55.0 +/- 22.7 days). Infant intraoral vacuums were measured via a small milk-filled tube taped alongside the nipple and connected to a pressure transducer. Milk intake was measured using the test weigh method. RESULTS: Infants in the Pain group applied significantly stronger baseline (-90.8 +/- 54.5 vs. -56.4 +/- 31.4 mmHg, p = 0.004), peak (-214.3 +/- 60.5 vs. 163.2 +/- 62.4 mmHg, p = 0.002) and pause vacuums (-104.8 +/- 67.9 vs. -45.8 +/- 30.3 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001). Despite similar active sucking times (377.5 +/- 175.2 vs. 349.4 +/- 184.0 sec, p = 0.554) the mean milk intake was significantly lower for infants of mothers with nipple pain (41.6 +/- 31.3 vs. 70.7 +/- 30.7 g, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Infants of breastfeeding mothers experiencing persistent nipple pain applied significantly higher vacuum to the breast during breastfeeding despite assistance with positioning and attachment from a <e>lactation</e> consultant. Further investigation into the cause of the abnormally high vacuums is essential to develop successful interventions for these mother-infant dyads.",M2
18477013,"Impact of maternal atopy and probiotic supplementation during pregnancy on infant sensitization: a double-blind placebo-controlled study.BACKGROUND: The effects of breastfeeding and probiotics on infant sensitization still remain discrepant. OBJECTIVE: To explore probable explanatory factors in infant sensitization and the protective effect of probiotics. METHODS: Altogether 171 mother-infant pairs from an ongoing placebo-controlled double-blind study with nutrition modulation by dietary counselling and probiotic supplementation were studied. Skin prick testing was done in infants at 6 and 12 months and in mothers at third trimester of pregnancy. The breast milk concentrations of cytokines TGF-beta2, soluble CD14, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2 were measured. RESULTS: The risk of sensitization increased in infants with allergic mothers breastfeeding over 6 months [odds ratio (OR=4.83, P=0.005)], or exclusively breastfeeding over 2.5 months (OR=3.4, P=0.018). Probiotic supplementation had a protective effect against sensitization in infants with a high hereditary risk due to maternal sensitization (OR=0.3, P=0.023). The concentration of TGF-beta2 tended to be higher in the colostrum of the mothers in the probiotic group as compared with those on placebo (probiotic/placebo ratio=1.50, P=0.073). A similar result was obtained in the subgroup of allergic mothers (probiotic/placebo ratio=1.56, P=0.094). CONCLUSION: Infants of atopic mothers, specifically when breastfed exclusively over 2.5 months or totally over 6 months, had a higher risk of sensitization at the age of 12 months. This risk could be reduced by the use of probiotics during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e>, partly by resulting in a beneficial composition of the breast milk.",M2
18460586,"High-dose carisoprodol during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e>.OBJECTIVE: To report a case of use of high-dose carisoprodol during pregnancy and breast-feeding. CASE SUMMARY: A 28-year-old woman with severe back muscle spasm took carisoprodol 2800 mg/day before and throughout an uncomplicated pregnancy and while exclusively breast-feeding her infant during the first month after birth. Serum drug concentrations of carisoprodol and the active metabolite meprobamate were measured in the mother and infant. Concentrations of these agents also were measured in breast milk. Developmental toxicity was not observed in the near-term infant, whose birth weight was at the 10th percentile for gestational age. Only slight sedation was noted in the infant during breast-feeding, and no signs or symptoms of withdrawal were noted when nursing was stopped. DISCUSSION: Carisoprodol and meprobamate are excreted into breast milk. Although the published human pregnancy data are limited to 15 cases, carisoprodol does not appear to cause developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/neurobehavioral deficits, or death), even when the mother is taking high doses. No signs or symptoms of withdrawal were noted in our infant or in a previously published case when breast-feeding was stopped. Long-term follow-up has not been conducted in exposed infants, and the possibility of functional/neurobehavioral l deficits appearing later in life cannot be excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Except for mild sedation, no other toxicity was observed in a near-term infant exposed to carisoprodol throughout gestation and during breast-feeding in the first month after birth.",M2

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether prolonged and exclusive breastfeeding improves children's cognitive ability at age 6.5 years. DESIGN: Cluster-randomized trial, with enrollment from June 17, 1996, to December 31, 1997, and follow-up from December 21, 2002, to April 27, 2005. SETTING: Thirty-one Belarussian maternity hospitals and their affiliated polyclinics. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 17,046 healthy breastfeeding infants were enrolled, of whom 13,889 (81.5%) were followed up at age 6.5 years. INTERVENTION: Breastfeeding promotion intervention modeled on the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative by the World Health Organization and UNICEF. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subtest and IQ scores on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence, and teacher evaluations of academic performance in reading, writing, mathematics, and other subjects. RESULTS: The experimental intervention led to a large increase in exclusive breastfeeding at age 3 months (43.3% for the experimental group vs 6.4% for the control group; P &lt; .001) and a significantly higher prevalence of any breastfeeding at all ages up to and including 12 months. The experimental group had higher means on all of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence measures, with cluster-adjusted mean differences (95% confidence intervals) of +7.5 (+0.8 to +14.3) for verbal IQ, +2.9 (-3.3 to +9.1) for performance IQ, and +5.9 (-1.0 to +12.8) for full-scale IQ. Teachers' academic ratings were significantly higher in the experimental group for both reading and writing.

18446536,"Breastfeeding in polycystic ovary syndrome.BACKGROUND: To investigate the breastfeeding rate in new mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: Case-control study. Thirty-six women with PCOS and 99 controls matched for age, gestational length and parity, answered a questionnaire. Breastfeeding at one-, three- and six-months postpartum was registered and the two groups were compared. In the women with PCOS, androgen levels through pregnancy were analysed and related to breastfeeding rate. RESULTS: At one-month postpartum, 27 (75%) of the women with PCOS were breastfeeding exclusively, whereas five (14%) did not breastfeed at all. Among controls, 88 (89%) were breastfeeding exclusively and two (2%) did not breastfeed (p=0.001). At three- and six-months postpartum, breastfeeding was equal in the two groups. Problems with sore nipples and seeking professional <e>lactation</e> support were also equal. Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate levels at gestational week 32 and 36 showed a weak negative association with breastfeeding in PCOS women. Breastfeeding rate was not associated with maternal gestational levels of androstenedione, testosterone, sex-hormone binding globulin, or free testosterone index in PCOS. CONCLUSIONS: Women with PCOS appear to have a reduced breastfeeding rate in the early postpartum period. Possibly, gestational dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate might negatively influence breastfeeding rate in women with the syndrome.",M2
18441871,"[Prolactin as a modulator of antiparasitic immunity]Prolactin (PRL) is a polypeptide hormone of the pituitary origin, that expresses over 300 separate biological activities, including its involvement in the regulation of immune functions. The hormone's immune capacities are related, among others, to comitogenic activity, prevention of immune cell apoptosis, stimulation of interleukins and antibodies production. Prolactin acts as a potent positive modulator of immunity to some protozoan parasites. It is well established that the hormone stimulates IFN-gamma and many other TH1-type cytokines production during Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania sp. and Acanthamoeba castellanii infections. Recent studies suggest that human prolactin may be a regulator of antiparasitic activity against Plasmodium falciparum. On the other hand pregnancy-associated hyperprolactinemia may have a relevant contribution to reactivation of latent infections caused by many helminthic parasites, like Ancylostoma sp. or Necator sp. It is possibly connected with the process of transmammary transmission of hookworm infection to breast-fed newborns. Moreover, an increase in endogenous circulating prolactin during late pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> in ewes infected with Haemonchus contortus, promotes the phenomenon of periparturient egg rise. High prolactin levels have also been seen in dairy cattle suffering from other trichostrongylids infections. In this article we have discussed the role of prolactin as an important regulator of immunity to parasites.",M2
18423017,"PCR-DGGE assessment of the bacterial diversity of breast milk in women with lactational infectious mastitis.BACKGROUND: Infectious mastitis is a common condition during <e>lactation</e> and in fact, represents one of the main causes leading to a precocious weaning. The number of studies dealing with lactational mastitis is low and, up to now, the etiological diagnosis is frequently made on the basis of unspecific clinical signs. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbial diversity of breast milk in 20 women with lactational mastitis employing culture-dependent and culture-independent (PCR-DGGE) approaches. METHODS: Breast milk samples were cultured in different media to investigate the presence of bacteria and/or yeasts, and a total of 149 representative isolates were identified to the species level by 16S rRNA gene PCR sequencing. The microorganisms recovered were compared with those found by PCR-DGGE analysis. To identify the DGGE profiles two reference markers of different microbial species were constructed. Sequence analysis of unknown bands was also performed. RESULTS: Staphylococci were the dominant bacterial group and Staphylococcus epidermidis was the dominant species. In a lower number of samples, other bacteria (mainly streptococci and a few gram-negative species) were also identified. Globally, PCR-DGGE results showed a good correlation with those obtained by culture-based methods. However, although DNA bands corresponding to different lactic acid bacteria were detected, such bacteria could not be isolated from the milk samples. CONCLUSION: Staphylococci seem to be the main etiological agents of human lactational mastitis. The combined use of culture and molecular techniques allowed a better characterization of the bacterial diversity in milk from women suffering from infectious mastitis. Our results suggest that this condition could be the result of a disbiotic process where some of the bacterial species usually present in human milk outgrow (staphylococci) while others disappear (lactobacilli or lactococci).",M2
18411639,"[The quality of breastfeeding preparation in the antenatal courses]OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of breastfeeding preparation in the antenatal courses and to identify the other sources of breastfeeding information. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Thomayer's Hospital Prague. METHODS: Data collected from questionnaires presented on web pages of the <e>Lactation</e> League from 2005 to 2006 from 351 mothers were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Only 52.8% of mothers were satisfied with the course content. Women who attended the antenatal preparation were more informed about the correct breastfeeding technique, the harmfulness bottle and pacifier usage, the disadvantages of the mother and newborn separation and alternative feeding methods than those who did not. The other sources of breastfeeding information were literature, magazines and internet. The health professional participation was only 9%. During pregnancy 82.9% of women did not pass the breast examination. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to improve the breastfeeding preparation quality of antenatal courses and to increase the health professional participation in breastfeeding information distribution.",M2
18405394,"Survey of patient satisfaction with the Breastfeeding Education and Support Services of The Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne.BACKGROUND: The Breastfeeding Education and Support Services (BESS) is a unit of The Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, staffed by International Board Certified <e>Lactation</e> Consultants (IBCLCs), providing day/short-stay and an outpatient clinic for mothers and infants with breastfeeding problems. It is important to measure women's experience of visiting the service as part of quality assurance. The aim of this project was to conduct an anonymous postal survey of clients' satisfaction with BESS. METHODS: An anonymous survey was posted on 16 November 2005 and again on 31 January 2006, to all women who had attended BESS in September 2005. RESULTS: The response rate was 60.5% (78/129). Eighty percent (62/78) of respondents attended day-stay, 33% (26/78) attended short-stay and 15% (12/78) attended the outpatient clinic. The percentage of women who responded  strongly agree  to the statement  Overall, I am satisfied with the services  was 49% (35/72) and 50% (6/12) for those who went to day/short-stay and the outpatient clinic respectively. Overall, 56% of all respondents responded that the quality of BESS was  better than expected . The most common breastfeeding problem reported was difficulty attaching the baby to the breast, followed by nipple damage, low milk supply and painful feeding. CONCLUSION: BESS seems to have provided a satisfactory service to most clients. Most respondents were clearly satisfied with the support given by the IBCLCs and have also responded that the staff were professional and knowledgeable in their field of work.",M2
18403931,"Dietary approaches to the prevention of food allergy.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The primary prevention of food allergy and atopy has become a public health priority in developed countries. Although some preventive dietary interventions have entered common practice, the level of evidence underpinning these strategies varies. RECENT FINDINGS: Exclusive breast-feeding and delayed introduction of complementary foods from the age of 4-6 months are key strategies in primary food allergy and atopy prevention. Maternal elimination diets during pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> are currently not recommended. Partially and extensively hydrolyzed formulae may confer a small preventive effect in high-risk infants. Amino acid-based formula is, however, considered a treatment formula and not recommended for primary allergy prevention. The effect of prebiotic oligosaccharides and probiotic bacteria in prevention of food allergy remains unclear and requires further investigation. Maternal fish oil supplementation during pregnancy shows promise in reducing the risk of allergic sensitization in the infant, but prospective long-term data are required. Fish oil supplementation in young infants was not effective. SUMMARY: Although there is evidence for the primary dietary prevention of eczema and possible respiratory allergies, data on food allergy prevention have, so far, remained less convincing. Further prospective research is needed to clarify the effectiveness of dietary interventions in primary food allergy prevention.",M2
18398514,"Allergy prevention - Current recommendations and new insights.BACKGROUND: The prevalence of allergic disease has increased considerably in recent decades and Australia has one of the highest rates of allergic disease in the world. As there is currently no cure for allergic diseases, prevention offers a logical approach to addressing the rising burden of disease. The factors responsible for this escalation in prevalence remain unclear, and strategies for allergy prevention remain limited. OBJECTIVE: This article discusses current recommendations for allergy prevention and highlights new insights into allergic disease. DISCUSSION: History of allergic disease in a first degree relative is currently the only useful indicator for increased risk of developing allergic disease in a child. Prevention strategies should be directed to these high risk individuals. Currently, maternal dietary restriction during pregnancy or <e>lactation</e> and aeroallergen avoidance are not recommended. Breastfeeding is recommended, and where not possible or insufficient, a partially hydrolysed formula should be used in high risk infants. Introduction of solids should be delayed to 4-6 months of age. There is no evidence that delaying solids beyond this age is of benefit. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the addition of probiotics for allergy prevention.",M2
18395932,"Children's nutrition and health in adulthood.Scientific and medical studies report that the environment, and particularly physical activity and the diet, changes the metabolic programming. A systematic review of size and growth during infancy supports conclusions with regard to preventing later obesity. Moreover, the correlation has been established between birth weight, arterial blood pressure, plasmatic lipid level, and cardiovascular mortality. The European Nutrition Committee has written new recommendations with lower protein levels. A lot of data support the application of blocking sensibilisation through intervention in pregnancy and <e>lactation</e>. Primary prevention is possible with breastfeeding for the first 4-6 months of life, particularly for high-risk allergic families. This is a priority for the national health program in France for controlling the increasing obesity.",M2
18394108,"The effect of alcohol intake on breastfeeding duration in Australian women.AIM: This study investigated the relationships between alcohol consumption and breastfeeding initiation and duration. METHODS: DESIGN AND SETTING: A 12-month longitudinal study was conducted in two public hospitals in Perth, Australia between September 2002 and July 2003. Intervention: Participating mothers completed a self-administered baseline questionnaire. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 4, 10, 16, 22, 32, 40 and 52 weeks. Main outcome measures: Association of the relationships between alcohol consumption and breastfeeding initiation and duration. RESULTS: After 6 months of follow-up, women who consumed alcohol at levels of more than two standard drinks per day were almost twice as likely to discontinue breastfeeding than women who drank below these levels (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1, 3.0). CONCLUSION: Consuming alcohol in excess of two standard drinks per day during <e>lactation</e> was found to be independently associated with shorter breastfeeding duration, even after consideration of previously identified predictors of breastfeeding duration. Guidelines that provide direction on safe alcohol consumption for lactating mothers may help support extended breastfeeding duration.",M2
18373190,"Breast-feeding after breast cancer: if you wish, madam.Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor-affecting women during the child bearing period. With the rising trend in delaying pregnancy later in life, the issue of subsequent pregnancy and <e>lactation</e> following breast cancer diagnosis has been more frequently encountered. In this context, data is scarce particularly those addressing the issue of lactation. In this review, we discussed different endocrinal, clinical and biological aspects dealing with breast-feeding after breast cancer in an attempt to determine how safe and feasible this approach is.",M2
18402851,"Pregnancy during breastfeeding in rural Egypt.BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding does not reliably protect against pregnancy except during the first 6 months postpartum and only then if accompanied by amenorrhea. Reluctance to use other methods of contraception during <e>lactation</e> may result in unplanned pregnancy. The aims of this study were to describe, among women in rural Egypt attending for antenatal care the prevalence of pregnancy during breastfeeding, contraceptive practice and unintended pregnancy. Finally, the study assessed women's impressions of the effect of conception during breastfeeding on breast milk and on the health of the breastfed infant. STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive study using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire for 2617 parous women attending a hospital in Egypt for antenatal care. RESULTS: More than 95% of women breastfed the child before their current pregnancy; 25.3% conceived while breastfeeding. Conception occurred during the first 6 months postpartum in 4.4%, before resumption of menstruation in 15.1% and while exclusively or almost exclusively breastfeeding in 28.1%. Only 10 pregnancies (1.5%) occurred when all the prerequisites of the lactational amenorrhea method of contraception (LAM) were present. Twenty-nine percent of pregnancies conceived during breastfeeding were unintended, 10% of women had considered terminating their pregnancy while 4.4% of them reported trying to do so. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy during breastfeeding is common in Egypt and is often unintended. There is great potential for using LAM, but it must be properly taught, and women should be encouraged to start using effective contraception as soon as any of the prerequisites of LAM expires.",M2
18398972,"Temporal and lateral dynamics of HIV shedding and elevated sodium in breast milk among HIV-positive mothers during the first 4 months of breast-feeding.OBJECTIVE: To better understand the dynamics of breast milk HIV shedding and its relation to postnatal HIV transmission, we investigated the temporal and lateral relations of breast milk viral shedding and sodium concentrations in HIV-positive women. DESIGN: This was a longitudinal cohort study in Lusaka, Zambia. METHOD: We examined patterns of HIV shedding in breast milk over the first 4 months of breast-feeding and their correlations with postnatal HIV transmission among 138 breast-feeding mothers. Sodium concentration in breast milk was also examined in the same samples and in breast milk from 23 HIV-negative controls. RESULTS: Higher breast milk viral load at 1 week, 1 month, and 4 months and consistent viral shedding in breast milk were significantly associated with increased risk of HIV transmission. Elevated breast milk sodium concentration (&gt; or =13 mmol/L) at 4 months was associated with HIV transmission, low maternal CD4 cell count, and high maternal plasma viral load. Elevated sodium concentration at 1 week postpartum was common and was not associated with any of these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent viral shedding and high breast milk viral load are strong predictors of mother-to-child HIV transmission. Although sodium concentrations later in breast-feeding correlate with breast milk viral load, increased breast milk sodium is normal in early <e>lactation</e> and does not predict HIV transmission.",M2
