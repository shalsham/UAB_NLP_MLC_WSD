16581731,"Male circumcision and risk of syphilis, chancroid, and genital herpes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.OBJECTIVES: Male circumcision is associated with reduced risk of HIV infection. This may be partly because of a protective effect of circumcision on other sexually transmitted infections (STI), especially those causing genital ulcers, but evidence for such protection is unclear. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analyses of the associations between male circumcision and infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), Treponema pallidum, or <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>. METHODS: Electronic databases (1950-2004) were searched using keywords and text terms for herpes simplex, syphilis, chancroid, ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases, or their causative agents, in conjunction with terms to identify epidemiological studies. References of key articles were hand searched, and data were extracted using standardised forms. Random effects models were used to summarise relative risk (RR) where appropriate. RESULTS: 26 articles met the inclusion criteria. Most syphilis studies reported a substantially reduced risk among circumcised men (summary RR = 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.83), although there was significant between study heterogeneity (p = 0.01). The reduced risk of HSV-2 infection was of borderline statistical significance (summary RR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01). Circumcised men were at lower risk of chancroid in six of seven studies (individual study RRs: 0.12 to 1.11). CONCLUSIONS: This first systematic review of male circumcision and ulcerative STI strongly indicates that circumcised men are at lower risk of chancroid and syphilis. There is less association with HSV-2. Potential male circumcision interventions to reduce HIV in high risk populations may provide additional benefit by protecting against other STI.",M1
15972475,"Trafficking pathways and characterization of CD4 and CD8 cells recruited to the skin of humans experimentally infected with <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.T-cell homing to infected skin is not well studied in humans. We examined sites experimentally infected with Haemophilus ducreyi by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry for expression of receptors and ligands involved in cutaneous T-cell homing and determined the phenotypes of the T cells that trafficked to skin. Endothelial cells expressed E-selectin in infected but not uninfected skin, while peripheral node addressin (PNAd) was minimally expressed in all samples. CC chemokine ligand 27 (CCL27) was expressed in the epidermis and endothelium of both infected and uninfected skin. Interestingly, CCL21, a chemokine thought to be associated principally with T-cell trafficking in the lymphatic compartment, was highly expressed on the endothelium of infected skin. Few naive cells were present in experimental lesions, emphasizing the combined role of PNAd and CCL21 in trafficking of this subset. Memory cells (CD45RA-) dominated both CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations at the site of infection. Effector memory (CD45RA- CD27-) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were enriched in lesions. Although the CC chemokine receptor 7-positive (CCR7+) population of both central memory (CD45RA- CD27+) and effector memory cells was not enriched in the skin compared to peripheral blood, CCR7+ cells were not precluded from entering infected skin. Taken together with our previous work (D. Soler, T. L. Humphreys, S. M. Spinola, and J. J. Campbell, Blood 101:1677-1683, 2003), these studies led us to propose a model of memory T-cell trafficking to skin in response to experimental H. ducreyi infection.",M1
15918786,"Treatment of chancroid in resource-poor countries.Chancroid, formerly a major cause of the genital ulcer disease syndrome, remains an important cofactor in both the transmission and acquisition of HIV-1 infection. Those countries with the greatest burden of HIV also have some of the highest prevalence rates of chancroid worldwide. The diagnosis of chancroid, caused by the fastidious bacterium <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, is both expensive and difficult in many resource-poor areas. These areas of the world use syndromic management to treat genital ulcers and such an approach has proven effective in reducing rates of bacterial genital ulcer diseases. There are currently inexpensive and effective single-dose therapies available to treat chancroid. Single-dose regimens, given at first presentation, improve compliance and reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections. Bacterial resistance to several antimicrobial agents has increased over the years and remains a continued threat to effective antimicrobial therapy. Follow-up of cases, and partner notification and treatment is carried out to limit reinfection and onward transmission of chancroid. Patients with coexistent HIV may be particularly at risk of failing single-dose therapy and should therefore be reviewed wherever possible.",M1
12444138,"Evolution of the cutaneous immune response to experimental <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> infection and its relevance to HIV-1 acquisition.Haemophilus ducreyi causes the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, which facilitates HIV-1 transmission. Skin biopsies were obtained from subjects experimentally infected with H. ducreyi to study the evolution of the immune response and immunophenotypes relevant to transmission of HIV-1. Compared with peripheral blood, there was an enrichment of T cells and macrophages after 48 h of infection in the skin. Neutrophils became the predominant cell type by 7-9 days. By immunohistochemistry, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha was not present early in infection, but was abundant at later stages. RANTES was present throughout the papular and pustular stages of experimental infection, but not present in uninfected control skin. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 was present at low levels in all samples examined. Macrophages in lesions had significantly increased expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 compared with peripheral blood cells, and CD4 T cells had significant up-regulation of CCR5. The magnitude of increased expression of these receptors was not replicated when PBMCs were incubated with H. ducreyi or H. ducreyi lipooligosaccharide in vitro. Together with the disruption of mucosal and skin barriers, the presence of cells with up-regulated HIV-1 coreceptors in H. ducreyi-infected lesions may provide an environment that facilitates the acquisition of R5 (CCR5), X4 (CXCR4), and dual-tropic HIV-1 strains.",M1
11584729,"Eradicating chancroid.Genital ulcers are important cofactors of HIV transmission in the countries most severely affected by HIV/AIDS. Chancroid is a common cause of genital ulcer in all 18 countries where adult HIV prevalence surpasses 8% and is rare in countries with low-level HIV epidemics. <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, the causative organism of chancroid, is biologically vulnerable and occupies a precarious epidemiological niche. Both simple, topical hygiene and male circumcision greatly reduce risk of infection and several classes of antibiotics--some of which can be administered in single-dose treatment regimens--provide rapid cure. H. ducreyi depends on sexual networks with high rates of partner change for its survival, thriving in environments characterized by male mobility and intensive commercial sex activity. Elimination of H. ducreyi infection from vulnerable groups results in disappearance of chancroid from the larger community. Once endemic in Europe and North America, chancroid began a steady decline early in the twentieth century, well before the discovery of antibiotics. Social changes--resulting in changing patterns of commercial sex--probably disrupted the conditions needed to sustain chancroid as an endemic disease. Sporadic outbreaks are now easily controlled when effective curative and preventive services are made available to sex workers and their clients. More recently, chancroid prevalence has declined markedly in countries such as the Philippines. Senegal, and Thailand, a development that may contribute to stabilization of the HIV epidemics in these countries. Eradication of chancroid is a feasible public health objective. Protecting sex workers and their clients from exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and improving curative services for STDs are among the proven strategies that could be employed.",M1
11317002,"Vitamin A and risk of HIV-1 seroconversion among Kenyan men with genital ulcers.BACKGROUND: Vitamin A is involved in normal immune function and the maintenance of mucosal integrity through complex effects on cellular differentiation. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether serum vitamin A levels were associated with altered susceptibility to primary infection with HIV-1 in men with high-risk sexual behaviour and genital ulcers who presented for treatment at an STD clinic in Nairobi, Kenya. METHODS: HIV-1 seronegative men were prospectively followed. Vitamin A levels at study entry were compared among 38 men who HIV-1 seroconverted versus 94 controls who remained HIV seronegative. RESULTS: Vitamin A deficiency (retinol less than 20 microg/dl) was very common and was present in 50% of HIV-1 seroconverters versus 76% of persistent seronegatives. Seroconversion was independently associated with a retinol level greater than 20 microg/dl (HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.25-4.70, P = 0.009), and a genital ulcer aetiology caused by <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> (HR 3.49, 95% CI 1.03-11.67, P = 0.04). Circumcision was independently associated with protection (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23-0.93, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Vitamin A deficiency was not associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 infection among men with concurrent STD. A decreased risk of HIV-1 seroconversion was independently associated with lower retinol levels. The effects of vitamin A on macrophage and lymphoid cell differentiation may paradoxically increase mucosal susceptibility to HIV-1 in some vulnerable individuals, such as men with genital ulcers. Lack of circumcision and chancroid are confirmed as important co-factors for heterosexual HIV-1 transmission. The role of vitamin A in heterosexual HIV-1 transmission requires further study.",M1
10701208,"[Chronic genital ulcerations and HIV infection: 29 cases]Genital ulcers are common manifestations of infectious disease. The incidence of genital ulcers featuring a chronic course has increased since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. The purpose of this 18-month cross-sectional study was to determine the main infectious causes of chronic genital ulcers (CGU) and their correlation with HIV infection. A total of 29 patients with CGU defined as an ulcer showing no sign of healing after more than one month were studied. Mean age ranged from 24 to 54 years. The male-to-female sex ratio was 1:5. The etiology was herpes in 19 cases (65.5 p. 100), chancroid in 6 cases (20.6 p. 100), streptococcal infection in 2 cases (6.8 p. 100), Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in 1 case (3.4 p. 100) and cutaneous amibiasis in 1 case (3.4 p. 100). Twenty-two patients (75.8 p. 100) presented HIV infection including 16 with HIV1 and 6 with HIV1 and HIV2. All patients with herpes were HIV-positive. Eighteen of these patients were in stage C3 of HIV infection. Genital herpes was the main etiology of UGC in patients with HIV infection (p &lt; 0.001). Conversely chancroid was the main etiology in patients without HIV infection (p &lt; 0.05). This finding suggests that herpetic CGU is highly suggestive of AIDS whereas chancroid CGU is not. Although syphilis is widespread in Africa, it was not a cause of CGU in this study. Search for herpes simplex virus or <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> in patients with CGU is an important criteria for presumptive diagnosis of AIDS in Africa.",M1
10448361,"Seroprevalence and incidence of genital ulcer infections in a rural Ugandan population.OBJECTIVES: To determine age-sex specific seroprevalence and incidence rates of Treponema pallidum, <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, and HSV-2; to assess the association between HIV-1 status and incidence of these STIs; and HSV-2 serostatus with number of lifetime sexual partners. METHODS: Antibodies against HIV-1, T pallidum, H ducreyi, and HSV-2 infections were tested using approximately 1000 paired (2 year interval) sera collected from a rural adult (15-54 years) population cohort in south west Uganda. RESULTS: Overall HIV-1 prevalence was 4.9%. Prevalence for T pallidum was 12.9% among males and 12.6% among females. The corresponding rates for H ducreyi were 9.8% and 7.3% respectively. HSV-2 prevalence rates were considerably lower in males (36.0%) than in females (71.5%), p &lt; 0.001. Incidence rates for T pallidum per 1000 person years of observation were 8.4 for males and 12.3 for females. The corresponding rates for H ducreyi were 24.6 and 20.0 and for HSV-2 were 73.2 and 122.9 per 1000 person years of observation, respectively. The RR of HSV-2 incidence was 3.69 in HIV seropositive cases versus HIV seronegative after adjusting for age and sex. The corresponding RR for H ducreyi was 3.50 among female HIV positive cases versus negatives with no effect seen in males. Association between HIV-1 prevalence and prevalence of other STIs was significant (Mantel-Haenszel test) for H ducreyi (p = 0.01) and for HSV-2 (p = 0.004) but not for T pallidum (p &gt; 0.4). HSV-2 prevalence was associated with number of lifetime sexual partners (females, p = 0.003; males, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The results have provided a reliable estimate of the magnitude of the STI problem and demonstrated an association between HIV-1 status and serology of other STIs in a general rural population in sub-Saharan Africa. The study has also highlighted a correlation between HSV-2 seropositivity and number of reported lifetime sexual partners.",M1
10023349,"Comparison of clinically directed, disease specific, and syndromic protocols for the management of genital ulcer disease in Lesotho.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate two protocols for the syndromic management of genital ulcer disease (GUD) in Lesotho, southern Africa and to compare the performance of these protocols with that of a conventional disease specific approach. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted among consecutive patients with GUD attending an STD clinic in Maseru, Lesotho. The clinical diagnoses were made by using predefined criteria at the initial visit before the performance of laboratory tests. Attempts were made to detect the specific aetiology of the genital ulcers using PCR assays and syphilis serology. The results of PCR assays and syphilis serology were used as the gold standard against which the performance of the management approaches were applied. RESULTS: Of 100 patients initially recruited into the study, <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> infection was detected in 56%, herpes simplex virus in 26%, Treponema pallidum in 23%, and lymphogranuloma venereum in 7%. No pathogens were detected in 6% of patients. 17% of patients had mixed infections. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the three management protocols for GUD were compared after applying each to the study population. Theoretically, the lowest correct treatment rate would have been obtained by using the disease specific protocol (62%) compared with more than 90% in both syndromic management protocols. Considerable overtreatment for primary syphilis would occur following application of both syndromic protocols. This would be the result of the overdiagnosis of chancroid, in particular the misdiagnosis of genital herpes as chancroid, which would receive treatment for syphilis unnecessarily. The HIV seroprevalence among these patients was 36%. A significantly higher rate of HIV seropositivity was detected among the patients with herpes simplex virus infection when compared with those patients having other causes of genital ulcer disease (58% v 27%; odds ratio 3.73; 95% CI 1.26-11.26; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Poor sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were recorded when the disease specific protocol was applied to the study population. In contrast, the syndromic management protocols provided adequate treatment for more than 90% of patients with GUD. Protocol C, which identified a minority of cases of genital herpes, was found to have an advantage when compared with protocol B (all patients with genital ulcer disease treated for both syphilis and chancroid) in that 29% of genital herpes cases would receive appropriate counselling.",M1
9918324,"The etiology of genital ulcer disease by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and relationship to HIV infection among patients attending sexually transmitted disease clinics in Pune, India.OBJECTIVES: To determine the etiology of genital ulcer disease (GUD) among patients attending sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in Pune, India, and to examine the relationship to HIV infection and compare the clinical diagnosis of GUD with the results of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) assay for Treponema pallidum, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and <e>Hemophilus ducreyi</e> infection. METHODS: Between June 20, 1994, and September 26, 1994, 302 patients with a genital ulcer were evaluated. Clinical etiology of GUD was based on physical appearance and microbiologic evaluations which included darkfield microscopy and serology for syphilis. Swabs of each genital ulcer were tested for HSV antigen by enzyme immunoassay (Herpchek; Dupont, Wilmington, DE) and processed in a multiplex PCR assay (M-PCR; Roche, Branchburg, NJ) for simultaneous detection of HSV, Treponema pallidum, and Hemophilus ducreyi. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-seven men and 25 women with a median age of 25 were evaluated. The seroprevalence of HIV was 22.2%. The etiology of GUD as determined by M-PCR was HSV (26%), H. ducreyi (23%), T. pallidum (10%), and multiple infections (7%); no etiology was identified in 34%. HIV seroprevalence was higher among those patients positive for HSV compared with other etiologies (OR = 2.1, CI: 1.2-3.7; p = 0.01). When compared with M-PCR, the Herpchek test was 68.5% sensitive and 99.5% specific. Darkfield detection for T. pallidum was 39% sensitive and 82% specific, in contrast to rapid plasma reagin and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test, which was 66% sensitive and 90% specific. Clinical diagnosis alone or in combination with basic laboratory tests showed poor agreement with M-PCR.The etiology of genital ulcer disease (GUD) and the relationship between GUD and HIV infection were investigated in 302 patients presenting to a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Pune, India, in a 3-month period in 1994.  Swabs of each genital ulcer were tested for herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigen by enzyme immunoassay and processed in a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of HSV, Treponema pallidum, and Haemophilus ducreyi.  The seroprevalence of HIV in this series was 22.2%.  Clinical diagnosis of GUD was undermined when HIV infection was present.  The etiology of GUD according to M-PCR was HSV in 26%, chancroid in 23%, primary syphilis in 10%, and multiple infections in 7%; no etiology could be identified in the remaining 34% of cases.  Attempts to differentiate the etiology of GUD based solely on clinical grounds resulted in many inaccurate diagnoses.  Chancroid was the most common clinical diagnosis (40%), followed by HSV (24%), syphilis (20%), and multiple infections (3%).  HIV seroprevalence was significantly higher in patients with HSV compared with other etiologies (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.7), presumably as a result of HIV-induced immunosuppression and consequent HSV reactivation.  Until rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive assays become available, syndromic treatment with antibiotics should be provided to patients with GUD in order to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection.",M1
9863586,"Genital ulcers in a primary health clinic in Rwanda: impact of HIV infection on diagnosis and ulcer healing (1986-1992).During 1986-88 and 1990-92, 1025 (97%) out of 1057 genital ulcer patients in Kigali, Rwanda, were tested for HIV antibodies and for infection with Treponema pallidum, <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> and herpes simplex virus. Overall, 57% of men and 80% of women had antibodies to HIV-1. The most frequent laboratory diagnoses were chancroid (27%), syphilis (19%) and genital herpes (19%) among men and syphilis (35%), genital herpes (23%) and chancroid (20%) among women. HIV-1 seroprevalence increased sharply over time among men but not among women. The clinical presentation of ulcers as well as laboratory diagnoses were similar in the HIV-1 seropositive and seronegative groups. The relative frequency of all laboratory diagnoses remained unchanged over time. HIV-1 seropositivity had no impact on ulcer healing. Advanced immunodeficiency was diagnosed among 12% of the HIV-1 seropositive patients and was significantly associated with increasing age and genital herpes.A study conducted at the Centre Medico-Social de Bilyogo, a primary health clinic located in an area of Nyamirambo, Kigali (Rwanda), where prostitution is widespread, assessed the frequencies of the causes of genital ulcer disease.  Out of 1057 consecutive genital ulcer patients tested in 1986-88, 57% of men and 80% of women were infected with HIV-1.  The most frequent laboratory diagnoses were chancroid (27%), syphilis (19%), and genital herpes (19%) among men and syphilis (35%), genital herpes (23%), and chancroid (20%) among women.  During follow-up in 1990-92, HIV-1 seroprevalence increased sharply among men of all ages and women under 30 years of age.  HIV-1 seropositivity had no effect on the clinical presentation of ulcers or on the time required for ulcer healing.  Advanced immunodeficiency, diagnosed among 12% of HIV-positive patients, was significantly associated with increasing age and genital herpes.",M1
9806035,"An investigation of genital ulcers in Jackson, Mississippi, with use of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay: high prevalence of chancroid and human immunodeficiency virus infection.In 1994, an apparent outbreak of atypical genital ulcers was noted by clinicians at the sexually transmitted disease clinic in Jackson, Mississippi. Of 143 patients with ulcers tested with a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, 56 (39%) were positive for <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, 44 (31%) for herpes simplex virus, and 27 (19%) for Treponema pallidum; 12 (8%) were positive for &gt; 1 organism. Of 136 patients tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by serology, 14 (10%) were HIV-seropositive, compared with none of 200 patients without ulcers (P &lt; .001). HIV-1 DNA was detected by PCR in ulcers of 6 (50%) of 12 HIV-positive patients. Multivariate analysis indicated that men with chancroid were significantly more likely than male patients without ulcers to report sex with a crack cocaine user, exchange of money or drugs for sex, and multiple sex partners. The strong association between genital ulcers and HIV infection in this population highlights the urgency of preventing genital ulcers in the southern United States.",M1
9704943,"HIV-1 subtype E incidence and sexually transmitted diseases in a cohort of military conscripts in northern Thailand.OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of and risk factors for HIV-1 seroconversion and describe sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevalence rates for young men in northern Thailand. METHODS: Data were collected from self-administered questionnaires and serologic testing at enrollment in a prospective study in 1991 and at follow-up after 6, 17, and 23 months on a cohort of 1115 men selected by lottery for military conscription. RESULTS: A total of 14 men seroconverted to HIV-1 envelope subtype E. The overall HIV-1 incidence rate was 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-1.8) per 100 person-years (PY) of follow-up. However, the rate was 2.0/100 PY for conscripts from the upper northern subregion of Thailand compared with 0.5/100 PY from other regions (adjusted rate ratio [RR] = 2.69; 95% CI, 0.8-12.2). On multivariate analyses, the behavioral factors associated with HIV-1 seroconversion were frequency of sex with female sex workers (FSWs; p = .04), receptive anal sex (adjusted RR = 6.73; 95% CI, 1.8-21.7), and large amount of alcohol consumption (adjusted RR = 3.12; 95% CI, 1.0-10.9). Genital ulceration was the STD most strongly associated with seroconversion. The prevalence of serologic reactivity to syphilis, <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, and herpes simplex virus type 2 increased with greater frequency of sex with FSWs and was generally higher for men from the upper north. CONCLUSION: Young men in northern Thailand are at high risk for HIV-1, primarily through sex with FSWs; and other STDs are highly associated with HIV-1 incidence. As HIV-1 infection extends into the general population, intervention programs are needed to address the problem of sexual transmission apart from commercial sex venues.Findings are presented from a prospective study conducted to determine the rate of and risk factors for HIV-1 seroconversion, and to describe sexually transmitted diseases (STD) prevalence rates for young men in northern Thailand.  Study findings are based upon data collected from self-administered questionnaires and serologic testing at enrollment in 1991 and at follow-up after 6, 17, and 23 months on a cohort of 1115 young men chosen by lottery for military conscription.  Men in Thailand are generally eligible for conscription in the year of their 21st birthday.  6.9% of the men were HIV-1 seropositive at enrollment; 15.3% of men from the upper northern region compared with 2.5% of men from elsewhere.  14 subjects seroconverted to HIV-1 envelope subtype E over the course of the study.  The overall HIV-1 incidence rate was 1.1/100 person-years (PY) of follow-up.  However, the rate was 2.0/100 PY for conscripts from the upper northern subregion of Thailand compared with 0.5/100 PY from other regions.  Multivariate analyses found frequent sex with female prostitutes, receptive anal sex, and high levels of alcohol consumption to be positively associated with HIV-1 seroconversion.  Genital ulceration was the STD most strongly associated with seroconversion.  The prevalence of serologic reactivity to syphilis, Haemophilus ducreyi, and herpes simplex virus type 2 increased with greater frequency of sex with female prostitutes, and was generally higher for men from the upper north.",M1
9587174,"A serosurvey of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus type 2 and their association with human immunodeficiency virus among female sex workers in Lagos, Nigeria.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence rates of serological reactivity of Haemophilus (H.) ducreyi, Treponema pallidum, and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) antibodies among female sex workers (FSWs) and their association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody status. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, standard serological assays were used for syphilis, HSV-2 and HIV; a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect specific anti-H. ducreyi immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA antibodies. RESULTS: Seroprevalence rates were 86% for anti-H. ducreyi IgG and 69% for anti-H. ducreyi IgA; 4% for rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and Treponema palladium hemagglutination assay (TPHA) confirmed syphilis; 59% for HSV-2; 12% for HIV-1 and 2% for HIV-2. Lower-class FSWs were significantly more likely than upper-class FSWs to be H. ducreyi seropositive (IgG: OR = 42.7; IgA: OR = 7.6) and have current or past syphilis infection (RPR: OR = 3.5; RPR and TPHA: OR = 4.5). The presence of syphilis increased significantly with older age (P-trend &lt; 0.001). Non-Nigerian FSWs had significantly higher reactivity to chancroid (IgG: OR = 3.5; IgA: OR = 1.8) and borderline reactivity to syphilis (RPR: OR = 1.6; TPHA: OR = 2.0). A history of sex with non-Nigerian Africans was significantly associated with chancroid reactivity and borderline significant with syphilis serostatus. H. ducreyi seropositivity was significantly more likely in FSWs with HSV-2 (OR = 2.4) and syphilis (OR = 5.6). Chancroid and HSV-2 antibodies were also more common in HIV-infected FSWs. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of H. ducreyi antibodies is the highest rate that has been reported. Our findings underscore the importance of an effective program to control GUDs as part of the strategy to prevent the potentially explosive spread of HIV in Nigeria.Cross-sectional standard serologic assays were used to determine the prevalence of Haemophilus ducreyi, Treponema pallidum, and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) antibodies among 796 female commercial sex workers from Lagos, Nigeria, and their association with HIV antibody status.  The seroprevalence rates were 86% for anti-H. ducreyi IgG and 69% for anti-H. ducreyi IgA, 4% for rapid plasma reagin and Treponema palladium hemagglutination assay confirmed syphilis, 59% for HSV-2, 12% for HIV-1, and 2% for HIV-2.  Lower-class sex workers were significantly more likely than upper-class sex workers to be H. ducreyi-positive and to have current or past syphilis infection.  The presence of syphilis increased significantly with older age.  Non-Nigerian sex workers had significantly higher reactivity to chancroid and borderline reactivity to syphilis.  A history of sex with non-Nigerian Africans was significantly associated with chancroid reactivity and borderline significant with syphilis serostatus.  H. ducreyi seropositivity was significantly more likely in female sex workers with HSV-2 and syphilis.  Chancroid and HSV-2 antibodies were also more common in HIV-infected sex workers.  The high prevalence of H. ducreyi antibodies detected in this study underscores the importance of an effective program to control genital ulcerative disease as part of the strategy to prevent the spread of HIV in Nigeria.",M1
8699082,"An immunohistochemical analysis of naturally occurring chancroid.<e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> is a major cause of genital ulcer disease in many developing countries and is associated with augmented transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, the mechanisms through which H. ducreyi produces ulceration are poorly understood. The characteristics of the host response to H. ducreyi and the pathobiology of its potential contribution to increased HIV susceptibility are not known. Chancroid ulcer biopsies from 8 patients were analyzed histologically and immunohistochemically. All biopsies had perivascular and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates that extended deep into the dermis. The infiltrate, which contained macrophages and CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, was consistent with a delayed hypersensitivity type cell-mediated immune response. The recruitment of CD4 T lymphocytes and macrophages may in part explain the facilitation of HIV transmission in patients with chancroid.",M1
8876358,"Sexually transmitted diseases: a survey of case management in Malawi.A national survey of sexually transmitted disease (STD) case management was carried out at 39 health care facilities in Malawi in 1994. Fifty-four health care providers were observed managing 150 patients presenting with selected STD syndromes and 103 providers were interviewed. STD case management was assessed by calculation of WHO/GPA prevention indicators (PIs) from observation data. The overall rate for PI-6, which measures correct assessment and treatment of STD patients was 11% (81% for history taking, 46% in physical examination, and 13% correct antibiotic treatment according to national guidelines). The score for PI-7, which measures overall patient counselling was 29% (65% for partner notification and 40% for condom advice). Although <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> is at least as common as Treponema pallidum as the causative agent for genital ulcers, only 16% of patients with genital ulcers were treated effectively for chancroid vs 56% for syphilis. Female patients received less comprehensive care than male STD patients. Only 20% of STD patients were offered condoms. Overall, the survey results support the policy decision to adopt syndromic management of STDs, and provide baseline information for planning and evaluation of a national control programme.",M1
8652728,"Treatment of chancroid with azithromycin.A randomized, comparative study undertaken in Nairobi, Kenya and a non-comparative evaluation undertaken in Carletonville, South Africa have both shown that a single oral dose of azithromycin 1 g is effective in the treatment of the genital ulcer disease (GUD), chancroid, with cure rates of 89% and 92% recorded respectively.

The World Health Organization currently recommends erythromycin 500 mg three times a day for seven days as the treatment of choice for Haemophilus ducreyi infection. We studied the effectiveness of a lower dose erythromycin treatment regime, 250 mg three times a day for seven days in the treatment of chancroid. Patients with genital ulcer disease presenting at Nairobi City council clinic between January and March, 1992 were recruited into the study. Swabs were taken from the ulcers for Haemophilus ducreyi and venous blood was screened for syphilis and HIV antibodies. A total of 219 patients were enrolled for the study and were reviewed on days seven and fourteen for side effects, bacteriological and clinical cure rates. 26.4% of the study population were HIV-1 seropositive. The treatment regime was well tolerated and effective in both HIV seropositive and seronegative patients. Complete bacteriological cure rate was achieved in Haemophilus ducreyi culture positives by day seven irrespective of the HIV serostatus. However, the clinical cure rate for HIV seropositive patients was 88% compared to 99% for seronegative patients (p&lt;.001). It is concluded that a low dose erythromycin is an inexpensive and effective treatment for chancroid with complete bacteriological cure rate, although the healing process takes longer in HIV seropositive patients.",M1

Patients were randomized to receive 250 mg of ceftriaxone im or 1 g of azithromycin orally, both given as a single dose. They were followed for up to 23 days after treatment. For 65 patients, cultures were positive for H. ducreyi; there were 68 patients whose cultures were negative for both H. ducreyi and herpes simplex virus and who had no evidence of syphilis. All 133 patients returned for at least one follow-up visit. At the time of the last follow-up visit, all 32 patients whose cultures were positive for H. ducreyi and who were treated with azithromycin were clinically cured. In all 33 culture-positive cases in which ceftriaxone was used, there was either clinical improvement or cure at the time of the patient's last follow-up visit. In addition, azithromycin and ceftriaxone were equally effective in healing ulcers for which cultures were negative. We conclude that a single 1-g oral dose of azithromycin is as effective as a 250-mg im dose of ceftriaxone for the treatment of chancroid.",M1

Of the new antimicrobials, azithromycin has been very effective in the United States, but the efficacy of this drug elsewhere has not been thoroughly evaluated. Fleroxacin has been very effective in Kenya.

7974076,"Single dose azithromycin for the treatment of chancroid: a randomized comparison with erythromycin.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chancroid is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and enhances the sexual transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Azithromycin is an orally absorbed macrolide antibiotic that is active against <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, the causative agent of chancroid, and has pharmacokinetic properties that are suitable for single dosing. STUDY DESIGN: In a randomized single-blinded study of 127 men presenting to a referral STD clinic with culture proven chancroid, we compared the efficacy of azithromycin, administered as a single 1 g dose, with erythromycin 500 mg given 4 times daily for 7 days. RESULTS: Cure rates were 89% (73 of 82) in the azithromycin group and 91% (41 of 45) in the erythromycin group. A failure to respond to treatment was associated with HIV-1 seropositivity and a lack of circumcision. Both regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin, given as a single 1 g oral dose, is an effective treatment for chancroid in men, and offers major prescribing advantages over erythromycin.",M1
8042123,"Recent changes in the epidemiology of genital ulcer disease in the United States. The crack cocaine connection.The incidence of syphilis and chancroid began to increase in the United States among heterosexuals in the mid-1980s, with most cases reported among minorities living in Eastern cities and in the South. A number of studies have established a link between increasing syphilis incidence rates and cocaine use, specifically the smoked form of the drug, which is known as  crack.  A similar link was hypothesized for chancroid, but supporting data became available only recently. In New Orleans, we showed that <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> infection in male patients was strongly associated with crack cocaine use. However, our studies also demonstrated that drug use by the patient actually was a marker for a more important risk factor: sexual exposure to a cocaine-using woman. Thus, although the details of the relationships among crack, sexual behavior, and the size and nature of core transmitter groups are not known, it is clear that crack cocaine abuse is the driving force behind the recent syphilis and chancroid epidemics in the United States. Although it is not possible to predict the effects of these events on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, the potential for significant synergism between them exists. New approaches to HIV surveillance should be developed taking this possibility into account. During the last 3 to 4 years, incidence rates of syphilis and chancroid have fallen in the United States, despite continued problems throughout the country with crack cocaine abuse. However, our studies and those of others have shown how difficult it is to recognize chancroid clinically, suggesting that the disease may be grossly underreported.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1

8321733,"The role of fluoroquinolones in sexually transmitted diseases.The management of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has reached a new level in the era of antibiotic resistance and human immunodeficiency virus infection. To date, no single antimicrobial is capable of eradicating the commonly encountered STD pathogens including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Treponema pallidum. Among the marketed fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and enoxacin all provide excellent in vitro activity (MIC90 &lt; 0.06 micrograms/ml) and excellent in vivo efficacy against N. gonorrhoeae, including multiply resistant isolates (penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae and chromosomally mediated resistant N. gonorrhoeae). Ofloxacin is the only fluoroquinolone approved by the Food and Drug Administration for chlamydial infection. All of the quinolones lack reliable in vitro activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum, a cause of nongonococcal urethritis. Although limited data suggest the usefulness of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease, these drugs cannot currently be recommended for single-agent therapy. <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> infections, however, can be managed effectively with the fluoroquinolones.

Confirmation of infection by culture of H. ducreyi is essential in therapeutic trials. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics for the isolate should be determined by agar dilution. Patients should be evaluated by appropriate laboratory tests for syphilis, infection with herpes simplex virus, gonorrhea, and (in North America) infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. The clinical history of the disease should be recorded and ulcers, buboes, and lymphadenitis mass described. Whenever possible, study participants also should be tested for HIV infection. Randomized, prospective, double-blind, active-control comparative clinical trials are preferred for evaluation of the safety and efficacy of new anti-infective drugs. Otherwise-healthy men and women should be enrolled in these studies. Patients with active syphilis or genital herpes should be excluded. Microbiological and clinical outcomes are paramount.",M1
1635549,"Chancroid in the United States, 1981-1990: evidence for underreporting of cases.Chancroid, a bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) characterized by genital ulceration, has reemerged in the United States during the last decade. From 1950 to 1980, cases were infrequently reported. After an epidemic in California in 1981, however, the numbers of cases increased, peaking in 1987 at 5,035. Despite a subsequent decline in numbers of reported cases to 4,223 in 1990, new areas continue to report outbreaks. Interpreting chancroid surveillance data is difficult because confirmatory culture media are not commercially available. In addition, states may not require that unconfirmed or even confirmed cases be reported. To determine if chancroid is more widely distributed than surveillance figures indicate, CDC contacted STD clinics in 115 health departments, located in 32 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico--areas chosen because they had reported five or more cases of chancroid in any single year during 1986-1990--to determine if cases might be occurring but not reported. Only 16 of the 115 clinics had culture media available for <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, and only nine had laboratory facilities complete enough to definitively diagnose chancroid, syphilis, or genital herpes, the most common STDs characterized by genital ulcers. Five or more clinically likely cases occurring in 1990 were identified in 24 states, seven more than surveillance figures indicated. Surveillance can be improved if a) states utilize the definitions for chancroid cases adopted for use in 1990 and b) microbiology laboratories utilize enhanced diagnostic methods.",M1

Two of the three patients from whom these isolates had been obtained were treated with sulphamethoxazole and both were clinical and bacteriological failures. Five of six patients with sulphonamide-susceptible H ducreyi responded to treatment with sulphamethoxazole. Failure of sulphonamides to eradicate H ducreyi in some patients with chancroid is associated with the presence of a sulphonamide resistant plasmid. In regions where this plasmid is present in H ducreyi TMP-SMX is the preferred treatment for chancroid.",M1
6635447,"Short-course and single-dose antimicrobial therapy for chancroid in Kenya: studies with rifampin alone and in combination with trimethoprim.Tetracyclines and sulfonamides are no longer effective for the treatment of chancroid in many parts of the world. Rifampin and trimethoprim both possess in vitro activity against <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, the causative agent of chancroid. In a randomized, controlled study, 22 patients with H. ducreyi-positive genital ulcers received 600 mg of rifampin once daily for three days, and 32 patients received 600 mg of rifampin plus 160 mg of trimethoprim once daily for three days. Both regimens rapidly eradicated H. ducreyi from ulcers, with subsequent healing of ulcers and buboes. Two relapses of ulcers and one therapeutic failure were observed in the rifampin-trimethoprim group, whereas no relapses or failures were noted in the rifampin group. In addition, all of 16 H. ducreyi-negative ulcers responded rapidly to treatment with either regimen. In an uncontrolled, open study, 22 H. ducreyi-positive ulcers were treated with a single dose of rifampin (600 mg) plus trimethoprim (160 mg). Ulcers and buboes resolved by day 14 in all but one patient. Thus, these short-course and single-dose regimens are effective against chancroid.",M1

7153512,"<e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> infections--time for reappraisal.As the literature on Haemophilus ducreyi and clinical chancroid is reviewed, it becomes obvious that many significant findings have been forgotten over the years. As a result, from the time of Ducrey's original description of the organism in 1890 until about 1977, both clinical and laboratory experts in the United Kingdom believed that H. ducreyi infections were rare, generally acquired abroad, and almost impossible to confirm in the routine laboratory! In consequence it was a common view that it was not worth looking for H. ducreyi until all other possible causes of genital ulceration had been excluded. Moreover, the search for such an infection stopped as soon as any other cause for the patient's lesions had been found. A decision to ignore this 'rule' in Sheffield led to our looking for H. ducreyi in specimens from an unselected series of patients with genital ulceration including a number with herpes genitalis infections. The surprise finding of H. ducreyi in circumstances suggesting that it was a secondary invader made us re-examine the whole question of H. ducreyi infections and chancroid and wonder if the same organism can act as a primary pathogen and as a secondary invader. An account of the media and methods we used and of the characteristics of the organism is presented. In an attempt to find out more about the characteristic coherent colonies of H. ducreyi we studied them with the scanning electron microscope. It is clear that the whole subject of H. ducreyi infections has been neglected in the United Kingdom, but we believe that interest has now been aroused and progress will surely follow. Some areas for further investigation are suggested.",M1
6802870,"Isolation and cultivation of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.A useful method for isolating and recognizing Haemophilus ducreyi from chancres and buboes of male patients is presented. A total of 41 clinical isolates of H. ducreyi were recovered from 33 patients over an 8-year period, and the experience with the 15 most recent isolates is presented in detail. Chocolate agar supplemented with 1% Iso VitaleX and 5% sheep blood agar were prepared, using Trypticase soy and Mueller-Hinton Agar bases, and incubation conditions included ambient, capneic, and anaerobic environments. Mueller-Hinton agar was clearly superior over Trypticase soy agar for isolation of H. ducreyi, although there was little difference between 5% sheep blood and supplemented chocolate agar. Growth in ambient air and under anaerobiasis was poor or lacking, whereas growth in 5 to 7% CO2 was good to luxuriant. Heat-inactivated and fresh (unheated)human blood clot tubes also were used for selective isolation. Although the rates of isolation from the two types of clot tube were not significantly different, unheated clot tubes were superior to heated clot tubes because of reduced level of contaminants. Gram stain characteristics taken from blood clot tubes and solid media, cellular and colonial morphology of the bacilli, and lack of oxidase, catalase, and biochemical activity except nitrate reductase were determinant factors. The results of this study demonstrated that successful isolation of H. ducreyi can be achieved with a minimal amount of resources and expertise.",M1
203634,"The microbiological flora of penile ulcerations.The penile ulcerations of 100 consecutive men were tested for microorganisms. A polymicrobial flora was identified in the ulcers of 97 men. The microorganisms recovered from these ulcers included combinations of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria (including Mycoplasma), herpes simplex virus, yeasts, and filamentous fungi. Fifty-three study entrants had microorganisms, identified by culture or serologic tests, that were considered primary in ulcer pathogenesis. Herpes simplex virus was the most prevalent and Treponema pallidum was the next most prevalent pathogen identified. Of our patients, 5% had two recognized pathogens confirmed by laboratory tests, and only one of these was suspected at clinical examination. In addition, the study suggests that microorganisms other than <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> can produce ulcers with a morphology mimicking chancroid.",M1

The ulcers healed after sulphonamide and streptomycin therapy. Although chancroid is an uncommon venereal disease in Australia, its incidence is still high in many tropical countries.

20385557,"Cytolethal distending toxin family members are differentially affected by alterations in host glycans and membrane cholesterol.Cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) are tripartite protein exotoxins produced by a diverse group of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Based on their ability to induce DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of cultured cells, CDTs are proposed to enhance virulence by blocking cellular division and/or directly killing epithelial and immune cells. Despite the widespread distribution of CDTs among several important human pathogens, our understanding of how these toxins interact with host cells is limited. Here we demonstrate that CDTs from <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni differ in their abilities to intoxicate host cells with defined defects in host factors previously implicated in CDT binding, including glycoproteins, and glycosphingolipids. The absence of cell surface sialic acid sensitized cells to intoxication by three of the four CDTs tested. Surprisingly, fucosylated N-linked glycans and glycolipids, previously implicated in CDT-host interactions, were not required for intoxication by any of the CDTs tested. Finally, altering host-cellular cholesterol, also previously implicated in CDT binding, affected intoxication by only a subset of CDTs tested. The findings presented here provide insight into the molecular and cellular basis of CDT-host interactions.",M2

The combined analysis of EXAFS and XANES data has allowed us to characterize the local structure around the Fe-heme with 0.02A accuracy, revealing a heterogeneity in the distances between iron and the two histidine ligands which was not evident in the X-ray crystal structure. In addition, we have shown that the metal oxidation state does not influence the Fe-heme coordination environment, whereas the presence of the CO and NO ligands induces local structural rearrangements in the enzyme which are very similar to those already observed in other hexa-coordinated heme proteins, such as neuroglobin.",M2
20309929,"Triblock copolymer matrix-based capillary electrophoretic microdevice for high-resolution multiplex pathogen detection.Rapid and simple analysis for the multiple target pathogens is critical for patient management. CE-SSCP analysis on a microchip provides high speed, high sensitivity, and a portable genetic analysis platform in molecular diagnostic fields. The capability of separating ssDNA molecules in a capillary electrophoretic microchannel with high resolution is a critical issue to perform the precise interpretation in the electropherogram. In this study, we explored the potential of poly(ethyleneoxide)-poly(propyleneoxide)-poly(ethyleneoxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) triblock copolymer as a sieving matrix for CE-SSCP analysis on a microdevice. To demonstrate the superior resolving power of PEO-PPO-PEO copolymers, 255-bp PCR amplicons obtained from 16S ribosomal RNA genes of four bacterial species, namely Proteus mirabilis, <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria meningitidis, were analyzed in the PEO-PPO-PEO matrix in comparison with 5% linear polyacrylamide and commercial GeneScan gel. Due to enhanced dynamic coating and sieving ability, PEO-PPO-PEO copolymer displayed fourfold enhancement of resolving power in the CE-SSCP to separate same-sized DNA molecules. Fivefold input of genomic DNA of P. aeruginosa and/or N. meningitidis produced proportionally increased corresponding amplicon peaks, enabling correct quantitative analysis in the pathogen detection. Besides the high-resolution sieving capability, a facile loading and replenishment of gel in the microchannel due to thermally reversible gelation property makes PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer an excellent matrix in the CE-SSCP analysis on the microdevice.",M2

We constructed a replication-deficient adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector expressing CdtB and investigated the toxic properties of this vector on HeLa cells. Ad5CdtB caused loss of cell viability, morphologic changes, and cell cycle arrest, findings similar to HdCDT intoxication. This confirmed that CdtB is responsible for the toxicity of the holotoxin when expressed in cells following transduction by an adenoviral vector, and indicated a possible potential of this novel strategy in studies of activity of intracellular products and in gene therapy of cancer.",M2
19451245,"An immunogenic, surface-exposed domain of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> outer membrane protein HgbA is involved in hemoglobin binding.HgbA is the sole TonB-dependent receptor for hemoglobin (Hb) acquisition of Haemophilus ducreyi. Binding of Hb to HgbA is the initial step in heme acquisition from Hb. To better understand this step, we mutagenized hgbA by deletion of each of the 11 putative surface-exposed loops and expressed each of the mutant proteins in trans in host strain H. ducreyi FX547 hgbA. All mutant proteins were expressed, exported, and detected on the surface by anti-HgbA immunoglobulin G (IgG). Deletion of sequences in loops 5 and 7 of HgbA abolished Hb binding in two different formats. In contrast, HgbA proteins containing deletions in the other nine loops retained the ability to bind Hb. None of the clones expressing mutant proteins were able to grow on plates containing low concentrations of Hb. Previously we demonstrated in a swine model of chancroid infection that an HgbA vaccine conferred complete protection from a challenge infection. Using anti-HgbA IgG from this study and the above deletion mutants, we show that loops 4, 5, and 7 of HgbA were immunogenic and surface exposed and that IgG directed against loops 4 and 5 blocked Hb binding. Furthermore, loop 6 was cleaved by protease on intact H. ducreyi, suggesting surface exposure. These data implicate a central domain of HgbA (in respect to the primary amino acid sequence) as important in Hb binding and suggest that this region of the molecule might have potential as a subunit vaccine.",M2
19451237,"Regulation of expression of the <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> LspB and LspA2 proteins by CpxR.The LspA1, LspA2, and LspB proteins of Haemophilus ducreyi comprise a two-partner secretion system that has been shown to be necessary for H. ducreyi to inhibit phagocytosis by immune cells in vitro. Inactivation of lspA1 resulted in increased levels of LspA2, suggesting that these two proteins are differentially controlled (C. J. Ward et al., Infect. Immun. 71:2478-2486, 2003). Expression of LspA2 but not LspA1 was shown to be both growth phase dependent and affected by the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS) in the growth medium. In addition, neither LspA1 nor LspA2 could be detected in culture supernatant fluid in the absence of FCS. DNA microarray analysis revealed that 324 H. ducreyi genes were differentially regulated after growth in the presence of FCS. Among these, the CpxRA two-component sensory transduction system was downregulated by the presence of FCS. Inactivation of cpxR resulted in increased expression of both LspB and LspA2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that a recombinant H. ducreyi CpxR protein bound the promoter region of the lspB-lspA2 operon. The cpxR and cpxA genes were shown to be part of an operon containing two additional genes in H. ducreyi 35000HP. This is the first description of a two-component sensory transduction system regulating a proven virulence factor of H. ducreyi.",M2
19397884,"Immunogenic and adjuvant properties of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> lipooligosaccharides.Haemophilus ducreyi, the chancroid-causing bacterium, produces lipooligosaccharides (HdLOS) that comprise 5-11 partially sialylated monosaccharides. Subcutaneous immunisation of mice with 5 microg of HdLOS purified from H. ducreyi strains 4438 and 7470 induced high levels of anti-HdLOS IgG. The antibody responses displayed T-cell-independent features, and were dependent upon Toll-like receptor 4/MyD88 signalling pathways as demonstrated using knockout mice. The immunogenicity of HdLOS was found to require the intact lipid A moiety. The specificity studies of the anti-HdLOS antibodies, as revealed by absorption studies, antibody detection in ELISA, and immune thin-layer chromatography, indicated that the majority of the anti-LOS antibodies were specific for the inner core of the HdLOS. Antibodies to HdLOS failed to inhibit LOS induction of TNF-alpha release from human mononuclear cells. The adjuvanticity of HdLOS7470 was assessed in BALB/c mice that were immunised with bovine serum albumin (BSA) with or without the addition of HdLOS. The addition of 5 microg HdLOS resulted in a 10-fold increase in the total anti-BSA IgG antibody level as estimated by ELISA. The highest increase was noted for IgG2b, which contrasted with the predominantly IgG1 subclass response to immunisation with BSA alone, indicating an immunomodulatory activity of the HdLOS.",M2
19118582,"A novel mode of translocation for cytolethal distending toxin.Thermal instability in the toxin catalytic subunit may be a common property of toxins that exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by exploiting the mechanism of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> cytolethal distending toxin (HdCDT) does not utilize ERAD to exit the ER, so we predicted the structural properties of its catalytic subunit (HdCdtB) would differ from other ER-translocating toxins. Here, we document the heat-stable properties of HdCdtB which distinguish it from other ER-translocating toxins. Cell-based assays further suggested that HdCdtB does not unfold before exiting the ER and that it may move directly from the ER lumen to the nucleoplasm. These observations suggest a novel mode of ER exit for HdCdtB.",M2
19103206,"Structural basis of heme binding in the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase from <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.The Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase from Haemophilus ducreyi is characterized by the unique ability to bind heme at its dimer interface. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structures of this protein in the heme-loaded (holo) and heme-free (apo) forms. Heme is asymmetrically bound between the two enzyme subunits, where heme iron is coordinated by two histidine residues, His64 and His 124, provided by the two subunits. Moreover, the binding of heme to the protein is ensured by stabilizing contacts between the prosthetic group and a limited number of other residues, most of which are not present in other bacterial enzyme variants. We show that the introduction of only three mutations at the dimer interface of the enzyme from Haemophilus parainfluenzae, a closely related bacterial species, is sufficient to induce heme-binding ability by this enzyme variant. Heme binding does not alter protein activity. Moreover, the binding of the prosthetic group does not induce any significant structural perturbation at the subunit level and requires only limited local structural rearrangements that widen the cleft at the dimer interface and cause a limited shift in the relative orientation between the subunits. The presence of a preformed heme-binding pocket and the significant solvent exposure of the cofactor to the solvent are compatible with the suggested protective role of the enzyme against heme toxicity or with its involvement in heme trafficking in the periplasmic space.",M2
19066198,"Evaluation of multiplex real-time PCR for detection of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, Treponema pallidum, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 in the diagnosis of genital ulcer disease in the Rakai District, Uganda.OBJECTIVE: To develop a real-time PCR assay that reliably and accurately detects the predominant sexually transmitted aetiological agents of genital ulcer disease (GUD) (Haemophilus ducreyi, Treponema pallidum and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2)) and to assess the use of real-time PCR diagnostic testing in a rural African field site. METHODS: Two multiplex real-time PCR reactions were used to detect H ducreyi/and HSV-1/HSV-2 in ulcer swabs from 100 people with symptomatic genital ulcers in rural Rakai, Uganda. Results were compared with syphilis, HSV-1 and HSV-2 serology. RESULTS: Of 100 GUD samples analysed from 43 HIV positive and 57 HIV negative individuals, 71% were positive for one or more sexually transmitted infection (STI) pathogens by real-time PCR (61% for HSV-2, 5% for T pallidum, 3% for HSV-1, 1% for H ducreyi and 1% for dual H ducreyi/HSV-2). The frequency of HSV in genital ulcers was 56% (32/57) in HIV negative individuals and 77% (33/43) in HIV positive individuals (p = 0.037). Assay reproducibility was evaluated by repeat PCR testing in the USA with 96% agreement (kappa = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: STI pathogens were detected in the majority of GUD swab samples from symptomatic patients in Rakai, Uganda, by real-time PCR. HSV-2 was the predominant cause of genital ulcers. Real-time PCR technology can provide sensitive, rapid and reproducible evaluation of GUD aetiology in a resource-limited setting.",M2
19015257,"Localization of the domains of the <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> trimeric autotransporter DsrA involved in serum resistance and binding to the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and vitronectin.Resisting the bactericidal activity of naturally occurring antibodies and complement of normal human serum is an important element in the evasion of innate immunity by bacteria. In the gram-negative mucosal pathogen Haemophilus ducreyi, serum resistance is mediated primarily by the trimeric autotransporter DsrA. DsrA also functions as an adhesin for the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and vitronectin and mediates attachment of H. ducreyi to keratinocytes. We sought to determine the domain(s) of the 236-residue DsrA protein required for serum resistance and extracellular matrix protein binding. A 140-amino-acid truncated protein containing only the C-terminal portion of the passenger domain and the entire translocator domain of DsrA exhibited binding to fibronectin and vitronectin and conferred serum resistance to an H. ducreyi serum-sensitive strain. A shorter DsrA construct consisting of only 128 amino acids was unable to bind to extracellular matrix proteins but was serum resistant. We concluded that neither fibronectin binding nor vitronectin binding is required for high-level serum resistance in H. ducreyi.",M2
18754324,"Cytolethal distending toxin upregulates RANKL expression in Jurkat T-cells.Cytolethal distending toxin, a bacterial exotoxin produced by a number of Gram-negative species, causes growth arrest and morphological alterations in host cells. Among these species are <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, the etiological agent of chancroid, and the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, highly implicated in localized aggressive periodontitis. CDT induces receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) expression in periodontal fibroblasts, the key bone-resorbing cytokine. T-cells are actively involved in localized inflammation-induced bone destruction, including periodontitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of purified CDT on the expression of RANKL and its decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG), in the Jurkat T-cell line. Quantitative real-time PCR indicated that 100 pg/ml of purified H. ducreyi CDT upregulated RANKL mRNA expression by 2.2-fold, after 24 h of exposure. This increase was corroborated by a 2.0-fold increase in RANKL protein release, as determined by ELISA. OPG was not detected in this experimental system. In conclusion, CDT enhances RANKL expression in T-cells, denoting that these cells are a potential target for the toxin and strengthening the potential link between this virulence factor and mechanisms associated with localized bone resorption.",M2
18678665,"<e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> LspA proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated by macrophage-encoded protein tyrosine kinases.The LspA proteins (LspA1 and LspA2) of Haemophilus ducreyi are necessary for this pathogen to inhibit the phagocytic activity of macrophage cell lines, an event that can be correlated with a reduction in the level of active Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in these eukaryotic cells. During studies investigating this inhibitory mechanism, it was discovered that the LspA proteins themselves were tyrosine phosphorylated after wild-type H. ducreyi cells were incubated with macrophages. LspA proteins in cell-free concentrated H. ducreyi culture supernatant fluid could also be tyrosine phosphorylated by macrophages. This ability to tyrosine phosphorylate the LspA proteins was not limited to immune cell lineages but could be accomplished by both HeLa and COS-7 cells. Kinase inhibitor studies with macrophages demonstrated that the Src family PTKs were required for this tyrosine phosphorylation activity. In silico methods and site-directed mutagenesis were used to identify EPIYG and EPVYA motifs in LspA1 that contained tyrosines that were targets for phosphorylation. A total of four tyrosines could be phosphorylated in LspA1, with LspA2 containing eight predicted tyrosine phosphorylation motifs. Purified LspA1 fusion proteins containing either the EPIYG or EPVYA motifs were shown to be phosphorylated by purified Src PTK in vitro. Macrophage lysates could also tyrosine phosphorylate the LspA proteins and an LspA1 fusion protein via a mechanism that was dependent on the presence of both divalent cations and ATP. Several motifs known to interact with or otherwise affect eukaryotic kinases were identified in the LspA proteins.",M2
18565588,"Copper and zinc binding properties of the N-terminal histidine-rich sequence of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase.The Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,ZnSOD) isolated from Haemophilus ducreyi possesses a His-rich N-terminal metal binding domain, which has been previously proposed to play a copper(II) chaperoning role. To analyze the metal binding ability and selectivity of the histidine-rich domain we have carried out thermodynamic and solution structural analysis of the copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes of a peptide corresponding to the first 11 amino acids of the enzyme (H(2)N-HGDHMHNHDTK-OH, L). This peptide has highly versatile metal binding ability and provides one and three high affinity binding sites for zinc(II) and copper(II), respectively. In equimolar solutions the MHL complexes are dominant in the neutral pH-range with protonated lysine epsilon-amino group. As a consequence of its multidentate nature, L binds zinc and copper with extraordinary high affinity (K(D,Zn)=1.6x10(-9)M and K(D,Cu)=5.0x10(-12)M at pH 7.4) and appears as the strongest zinc(II) and copper(II) chelator between the His-rich peptides so far investigated. These K(D) values support the already proposed role of the N-terminal His-rich region of H. ducreyi Cu,ZnSOD in copper recruitment under metal starvation, and indicate a similar function in the zinc(II) uptake, too. The kinetics of copper(II) transfer from L to the active site of Cu-free N-deleted H. ducreyi Cu,ZnSOD showed significant pH and copper-to-peptide ratio dependence, indicating specific structural requirements during the metal ion transfer to the active site. Interestingly, the complex CuHL has significant superoxide dismutase like activity, which may suggest multifunctional role of the copper(II)-bound N-terminal His-rich domain of H. ducreyi Cu,ZnSOD.",M2
18375807,"Identification of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> genes expressed during human infection.To identify Haemophilus ducreyi transcripts that are expressed during human infection, we used selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS) with RNA isolated from pustules obtained from three volunteers infected with H. ducreyi, and with RNA isolated from broth-grown bacteria used to infect volunteers. With SCOTS, competitive hybridization of tissue-derived and broth-derived sequences identifies genes that may be preferentially expressed in vivo. Among the three tissue specimens, we identified 531 genes expressed in vivo. Southern blot analysis of 60 genes from each tissue showed that 87 % of the identified genes hybridized better with cDNA derived from tissue specimens than with cDNA derived from broth-grown bacteria. RT-PCR on nine additional pustules confirmed in vivo expression of 10 of 11 selected genes in other volunteers. Of the 531 genes, 139 were identified in at least two volunteers. These 139 genes fell into several functional categories, including biosynthesis and metabolism, regulation, and cellular processes, such as transcription, translation, cell division, DNA replication and repair, and transport. Detection of genes involved in anaerobic and aerobic respiration indicated that H. ducreyi likely encounters both microenvironments within the pustule. Other genes detected suggest an increase in DNA damage and stress in vivo. Genes involved in virulence in other bacterial pathogens and 32 genes encoding hypothetical proteins were identified, and may represent novel virulence factors. We identified three genes, lspA1, lspA2 and tadA, known to be required for virulence in humans. This is the first study to broadly define transcripts expressed by H. ducreyi in humans.",M2

18212073,"Outer membrane protein DsrA is the major fibronectin-binding determinant of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.The ability to bind extracellular matrix proteins is a critical virulence determinant for skin pathogens. Haemophilus ducreyi, the etiological agent of the genital ulcer disease chancroid, binds extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin (FN). We investigated H. ducreyi FN binding and report several important findings about this interaction. First, FN binding by H. ducreyi was greatly increased in bacteria grown on heme and almost completely inhibited by hemoglobin. Second, wild-type strain 35000HP bound significantly more FN than did a dsrA mutant in two different FN binding assays. Third, the expression of dsrA in the dsrA mutant restored FN binding and conferred the ability to bind FN to a non-FN-binding Haemophilus influenzae strain. Fourth, an anti-DsrA monoclonal antibody partially blocked FN binding by H. ducreyi. The hemoglobin receptor, the collagen-binding protein, the H. ducreyi lectin, the fine-tangle pili, and the outer membrane protein OmpA2 were not involved in H. ducreyi FN binding, since single mutants bound FN as well as the parent strain did. However, the major outer membrane protein may have a minor role in FN binding by H. ducreyi, since a double dsrA momp mutant bound less FN than did the single dsrA mutant. Finally, despite major sequence differences, DsrA proteins from both class I and class II H. ducreyi strains mediated FN and vitronectin binding. We concluded that DsrA is the major factor involved in FN binding by both classes of H. ducreyi strains.",M2
17965355,"Evidence that the cytolethal distending toxin locus was once part of a genomic island in the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans strain Y4.The authors have previously shown that the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter (formerly Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans Y4 contains an operon for a genotoxin known as the cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt). The cdt locus in strain Y4 is flanked by remnants of heterologous plasmid and integrase sequences. In this study, the DNA sequence immediately downstream from the cdt locus on the Y4 chromosome was examined. The extended sequence contained a region that had all the characteristics of a typical bacterial pathogenicity or genomic island. The genomic island (GIY4-1) was approximately 22 kb long, was flanked by a bacteriophage attachment (att) sequence and contained a full-length integrase/resolvase gene (xerD). A total of 22 complete and partial ORFs represented putative DNA replication/DNA binding/conjugation proteins as well as hypothetical proteins. GIY4-1 was most closely related to putative genomic islands in <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> 35000HP and Haemophilus influenzae 86-028NP and to a chromosomal region in Haemophilus somnus 129PT. GIY4-1 was not present in HK1651, which was used as the prototype strain for genomic sequencing of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Several sequences in GIY4-1 were homologous to ORFs found on the A. actinomycetemcomitans plasmid pVT745. None of the identified ORFs in GIY4-1 appeared to encode potential virulence genes.

17704897,"A role for <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> Cu,ZnSOD in resistance to heme toxicity.The Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,ZnSOD) from Haemophilus ducreyi is the only enzyme of this class which binds a heme molecule at its dimer interface. To explore the role of the enzyme in this heme-obligate bacterium, a sodC mutant was created by insertional inactivation. No difference in growth rate was observed during heme limitation. In contrast, under heme rich conditions growth of the sodC mutant was impaired compared to the wild type strain. This growth defect was abolished by supplementation of exogenous catalase. Genetic complementation of the sodC mutant in trans demonstrated that the enzymatic property or the heme-binding activity of the protein could repair the growth defect of the sodC mutant. These results indicate that Cu,ZnSOD protects Haemophilus ducreyi from heme toxicity.",M2
17662691,"The Hd0053 gene of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> encodes an alpha2,3-sialyltransferase.Haemophilus ducreyi is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes chancroid, a sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease. Different lipooligosaccharide (LOS) structures have been identified from H. ducreyi strain 35000, including those sialylated glycoforms. Surface LOS of H. ducreyi is considered an important virulence factor that is involved in ulcer formation, cell adhesion, and invasion of host tissue. Gene Hd0686 of H. ducreyi, designated lst (for lipooligosaccharide sialyltransferase), was identified to encode an alpha2,3-sialyltransferase that is important for the formation of sialylated LOS. Here, we show that Hd0053 of H. ducreyi genomic strain 35000HP, the third member of the glycosyltransferase family 80 (GT80), also encodes an alpha2,3-sialyltransferase that may be important for LOS sialylation.",M2
17598041,"Herpes simplex virus infection and genital ulcer disease among patients with sexually transmitted infections in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.The relative importance of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> and Treponema pallidum in genital ulcer disease in Africa has decreased recently, whereas that of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 has increased. We analysed 301 lesional specimens from Tanzanian patients with genital ulcer disease for the presence of H. ducreyi, T. pallidum and HSV-1/HSV-2 by performing a separate PCR for each pathogen. Infectious agents were detected in 211 (70%) of the cases. A single pathogen was found in 191 samples and two or more pathogens in the remaining 20. HSV-2 represented 83% of all identified pathogens, HSV-1 8%, T. pallidum 4% and H. ducreyi 5%. HSV-1 was identified as a single pathogen in four samples, in combination with others in an additional 14 samples. Thus, HSV-1 can also be the cause of genital ulcer disease in Africa. Regular surveillance of genital ulcer disease aetiology is important in programs for management of genital ulcer disease and HIV in Africa.",M2
17172329,"Complete genome sequence of Haemophilus somnus (Histophilus somni) strain 129Pt and comparison to <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> 35000HP and Haemophilus influenzae Rd.Haemophilus somnus can be either a commensal of bovine mucosal surfaces or an opportunistic pathogen. Pathogenic strains of H. somnus are a significant cause of systemic disease in cattle. We report the genome sequence of H. somnus 129Pt, a nonpathogenic commensal preputial isolate, and the results of a genome-wide comparative analysis of H. somnus 129Pt, Haemophilus influenzae Rd, and Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HP. We found unique genes in H. somnus 129Pt involved in lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis, carbohydrate uptake and metabolism, cation transport, amino acid metabolism, ubiquinone and menaquinone biosynthesis, cell surface adhesion, biosynthesis of cofactors, energy metabolism, and electron transport. There were also many genes in common among the three organisms. Our comparative analyses of H. somnus 129Pt, H. influenzae Rd, and H. ducreyi 35000HP revealed similarities and differences in the numbers and compositions of genes involved in metabolism, host colonization, and persistence. These results lay a foundation for research on the host specificities and niche preferences of these organisms. Future comparisons between H. somnus 129Pt and virulent strains will aid in the development of protective strategies and vaccines to protect cattle against H. somnus disease.",M2
17030566,"Identification of genes involved in the expression of atypical lipooligosaccharide structures from a second class of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.Haemophilus ducreyi is a gram-negative bacterium that is the causative agent of chancroid. Strain 35000HP has been well characterized and is representative of the majority of H. ducreyi strains. Strain 35000HP produces a lipooligosaccharide (LOS) that contains D-glycero-D-manno-heptose in the main oligosaccharide chain extension; the lbgB gene has been shown to encode the DD-heptosyltransferase. The lbgB gene is found in a gene cluster together with the lbgA gene, which encodes for the galactosyltransferase I. These two genes are flanked by two housekeeping genes, rpmE and xthA, encoding the ribosomal protein L31 and the exonuclease III, respectively. Recently, a second group of H. ducreyi strains have been identified. Strain 33921, a representative of the class II strains, produces an LOS that lacks DD-heptose in the oligosaccharide portion of its LOS. To better understand the biosynthesis of the DD-heptose-deficient 33921 LOS, we cloned and sequenced the corresponding lbgAB genomic region from strain 33921. Similar to strain 35000HP, the 33921 genome contains xthA and rpmE. However, between these two genes we identified genes encoding two putative glycosyltransferases that were not highly homologous to the 35000HP lbgAB genes. In this study, we demonstrate that the product of one of these genes encodes a galactosyltransferase. In addition, dot blot hybridization determined that 3 of 35 strains tested had the atypical transferases present, as did 4 strains characterized as class II strains by other criterion. These data indicate that the lbgAB genes can serve as one indicator of the classification of H. ducreyi strains.",M2
17015664,"The genome sequence of Mannheimia haemolytica A1: insights into virulence, natural competence, and Pasteurellaceae phylogeny.The draft genome sequence of Mannheimia haemolytica A1, the causative agent of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), is presented. Strain ATCC BAA-410, isolated from the lung of a calf with BRDC, was the DNA source. The annotated genome includes 2,839 coding sequences, 1,966 of which were assigned a function and 436 of which are unique to M. haemolytica. Through genome annotation many features of interest were identified, including bacteriophages and genes related to virulence, natural competence, and transcriptional regulation. In addition to previously described virulence factors, M. haemolytica encodes adhesins, including the filamentous hemagglutinin FhaB and two trimeric autotransporter adhesins. Two dual-function immunoglobulin-protease/adhesins are also present, as is a third immunoglobulin protease. Genes related to iron acquisition and drug resistance were identified and are likely important for survival in the host and virulence. Analysis of the genome indicates that M. haemolytica is naturally competent, as genes for natural competence and DNA uptake signal sequences (USS) are present. Comparison of competence loci and USS in other species in the family Pasteurellaceae indicates that M. haemolytica, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> form a lineage distinct from other Pasteurellaceae. This observation was supported by a phylogenetic analysis using sequences of predicted housekeeping genes.",M2
16951363,"Role of N-acetylglucosamine within core lipopolysaccharide of several species of gram-negative bacteria in targeting the DC-SIGN (CD209).Our recent studies have shown that the dendritic cell-specific ICAM nonintegrin CD209 (DC-SIGN) specifically binds to the core LPS of Escherichia coli K12 (E. coli), promoting bacterial adherence and phagocytosis. In this current study, we attempted to map the sites within the core LPS that are directly involved in LPS-DC-SIGN interaction. We took advantage of four sets of well-defined core LPS mutants, which are derived from E. coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> and determined interaction of each of these four sets with DC-SIGN. Our results demonstrated that N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) sugar residues within the core LPS in these bacteria play an essential role in targeting the DC-SIGN receptor. Our results also imply that DC-SIGN is an innate immune receptor and the interaction of bacterial core LPS and DC-SIGN may represent a primeval interaction between Gram-negative bacteria and host phagocytic cells.",M2
16422259,"Detection of pathogens causing genital ulcer disease by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.OBJECTIVE: To establish a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of pathogens causing genital ulcer disease (GUD). METHODS: Based on the gene-specific region of the following pathogens: Chlamydia trachomatis omp1/ompb, herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA polymerase, Treponema pallidum tpp47, <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> 16s rRNA, four sets of primers were designed and an M-PCR assay was developed to detect four pathogens in one test. The assay was evaluated with diagnostic result of golden standard for each pathogen. RESULTS: Of the 51 clinical samples, M-PCR showed slightly higher positive rate (47.1%) of HSV than cell culture (23.6%). Meanwhile, the positive rate of T. pallidum detected by M-PCR and dark-field microscopy was 19.6% (10/51) and 15.7% (8/51), respectively. Only one sample was positive for H. ducreyi and no sample was positive for C. trachomatis detected by both M-PCR assay and culture. CONCLUSION: This primary study indicated that M-PCR assay can simultaneously and rapidly detect the four etiologic pathogens causing GUD.",M2
16390960,"Molecular characterization of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> isolates from different geographical locations.The technique of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was adapted and optimized to study Haemophilus ducreyi isolates. A panel of 43 strains isolated from chancroid patients from different countries in Africa, Europe, North America, and Asia were characterized. The strains were also studied with respect to lipooligosaccharide (LOS) migration and immunoblotting patterns and the presence of cytolethal distending toxin genes. The RAPD method with the OPJ20 primer generated nine banding patterns (1 to 9). The majority of the isolates were clustered into two major profiles, 14 and 13 strains into profiles 1 and 2, respectively, and just a few strains revealed patterns 3 and 4. The isolates from Thailand were exceptional in that they showed greater diversity and were represented by six different RAPD patterns, i.e., patterns 3 and 5 to 9. The LOS migration and immunoblotting analyses revealed two different patterns, which indicated long and short forms of LOS; the former was found in 20/23 tested strains. Two strains that expressed the short form of LOS were grouped into RAPD pattern 4. The absence of cdtABC genes was observed in only 4/23 strains, and three of these isolates were assigned to RAPD pattern 4. Our results showed limited genotypic and phenotypic variations among H. ducreyi strains, as supported by the conserved RAPD and LOS profiles shared by the majority of the studied strains. However, the RAPD method identified differences between strains, including those from different geographic areas, which indicate the potential of RAPD as an epidemiological tool for the typing of H. ducreyi isolates in countries where chancroid is endemic.",M2
16313618,"Characterization of point mutations in the cdtA gene of the cytolethal distending toxin of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.The Cdt is a family of gram-negative bacterial toxins that typically arrest eukaryotic cells in the G0/G1 or G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The toxin is a heterotrimer composed of the cdtA, cdtB and cdtC gene products. Although it has been shown that the CdtA protein subunit binds to cells in culture and in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CELISA) the precise mechanisms by which CdtA interacts with CdtB and CdtC has not yet been clarified. In this study we employed a random mutagenesis strategy to construct a library of point mutations in cdtA to assess the contribution of individual amino acids to binding activity and to the ability of the subunit to form biologically active holotoxin. Single unique amino acid substitutions in seven CdtA mutants resulted in reduced binding of the purified recombinant protein to Chinese hamster ovary cells and loss of binding to the fucose-containing glycoprotein, thyroglobulin. These mutations clustered at the 5'- and 3'-ends of the cdtA gene resulting in amino acid substitutions that resided outside of the aromatic patch region and a conserved region in CdtA homologues. Three of the amino acid substitutions, at positions S165N (mutA81), T41A (mutA121) and C178W (mutA221) resulted in gene products that formed holotoxin complexes that exhibited a 60% reduction (mutA81) or loss (mutA121, mutA221) of proliferation inhibition. A similar pattern was observed when these mutant holotoxins were tested for their ability to induce cell cycle arrest and to convert supercoiled DNA to relaxed and linear forms in vitro. The mutations in mutA81 and mutA221 disrupted holotoxin formation. The positions of the amino acid substitutions were mapped in the <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> Cdt crystal structure providing some insight into structure and function.",M2
16185082,"X-ray absorption investigation of a unique protein domain able to bind both copper(I) and copper(II) at adjacent sites of the N-terminus of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase.The N-terminal metal binding extension of the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase from Haemophilus ducreyi is constituted by a histidine-rich region followed by a methione-rich sequence which shows high similarity with protein motifs involved in the binding of Cu(I). X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments selectively carried out with peptides corresponding to the two metal binding regions indicate that both sequences can bind either Cu(II) or Cu(I). However, competition experiments demonstrate that Cu(II) is preferred by histidine residues belonging to the first half of the motif, while the methionine-rich region preferentially binds Cu(I) via the interaction with three methionine sulfur atoms. Moreover, we have observed that the rate of copper transfer from the peptides to the active site of a copper-free form of the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase mutant lacking the N-terminal extension depends on the copper oxidation state and on the residues involved in metal binding, histidine residues being critically important for the efficient transfer. Differences in the enzyme reactivation rates in the presence of mixtures of the two peptides when compared to those obtained with the single peptides suggest that the two halves of the N-terminal domain functionally interact during the process of copper transfer, possibly through subtle modifications of the copper coordination environment.",M2
16177350,"Identification of a novel sialic acid transporter in <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.Haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of chancroid, produces a lipooligosaccharide (LOS) which terminates in N-acetyllactosamine. This glycoform can be further extended by the addition of a single sialic acid residue to the terminal galactose moiety. H. ducreyi does not synthesize sialic acid, which must be acquired from the host during infection or from the culture medium when the bacteria are grown in vitro. However, H. ducreyi does not have genes that are highly homologous to the genes encoding known bacterial sialic acid transporters. In this study, we identified the sialic acid transporter by screening strains in a library of random transposon mutants for those mutants that were unable to add sialic acid to N-acetyllactosamine-containing LOS. Mutants that reacted with the monoclonal antibody 3F11, which recognizes the terminal lactosamine structure, and lacked reactivity with the lectin Maackia amurensis agglutinin, which recognizes alpha2,3-linked sialic acid, were further characterized to demonstrate that they produced a N-acetyllactosamine-containing LOS by silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analyses. The genes interrupted in these mutants were mapped to a four-gene cluster with similarity to genes encoding bacterial ABC transporters. Uptake assays using radiolabeled sialic acid confirmed that the mutants were unable to transport sialic acid. This study is the first report of bacteria using an ABC transporter for sialic acid uptake.",M2
15953025,"Cellular internalization of cytolethal distending toxin: a new end to a known pathway.The cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) are unique in their ability to induce DNA damage, activate checkpoint responses and cause cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in intoxicated cells. However, little is known about their cellular internalization pathway. We demonstrate that binding of the <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> CDT (HdCDT) on the plasma membrane of sensitive cells was abolished by cholesterol extraction with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. The toxin was internalized via the Golgi complex, and retrogradely transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as assessed by N-linked glycosylation. Further translocation from the ER did not require the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, and was Derlin-1 independent. The genotoxic activity of HdCDT was dependent on its internalization and its DNase activity, as induction of DNA double-stranded breaks was prevented in Brefeldin A-treated cells and in cells exposed to a catalytically inactive toxin. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the CDT mode of action and highlight two important aspects of the biology of this bacterial toxin family: (i) HdCDT translocation from the ER to the nucleus does not involve the classical pathways followed by other retrogradely transported toxins and (ii) toxin internalization is crucial for execution of its genotoxic activity.",M2
15908371,"Killing of dsrA mutants of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> by normal human serum occurs via the classical complement pathway and is initiated by immunoglobulin M binding.Previously, we showed that serum resistance in Haemophilus ducreyi type strain 35000HP required expression of the outer membrane protein DsrA because the isogenic dsrA mutant FX517 is highly serum susceptible. In this study, we confirmed this finding by construction of additional serum-susceptible dsrA mutants in more recently isolated serum-resistant strains. We also demonstrated that killing of dsrA mutants required an intact classical complement cascade but not the alternative or mannan-binding lectin pathways. Between 5- and 10-fold more purified human immunoglobulin M (IgM) but not IgG was deposited onto dsrA mutant FX517 than onto parent strain 35000HP, consistent with IgM initiation of the classical cascade. Depletion of IgM, but not IgG, from complement-intact serum inhibited killing of FX517. As predicted from the amounts of IgM bound, more of the individual complement components were bound by FX517 than by parent strain 35000HP. Examination of the binding of negative regulators of complement as an explanation for serum resistance indicated that parent strain 35000HP bound more C4 binding protein and vitronectin than FX517 but not factor H. However, the degree and pattern of complement component binding observed suggested that IgM binding to the serum-susceptible mutant FX517 was responsible for the activation of the classical pathway and the observed killing of FX517 as opposed to binding of negative regulators of complement by the serum-resistant parent. We speculate that an undefined neo-epitope, possibly carbohydrate, is exposed in the dsrA mutant that is recognized by naturally occurring bactericidal IgM antibodies present in human sera.",M2
15838019,"Characterization of a cluster of three glycosyltransferase enzymes essential for Moraxella catarrhalis lipooligosaccharide assembly.Moraxella catarrhalis isolates express lipooligosaccharide (LOS) molecules on their surface, which share epitopes similar to that of the Neisseria and Haemophilus species. These common LOS epitopes have been implicated in various steps of pathogenesis for the different organisms. In this study, a cluster of three LOS glycosyltransferase genes (lgt) were identified in M. catarrhalis 7169, a strain that produces a serotype B LOS. Mutants in these glycosyltransferase genes were constructed, and the resulting LOS phenotypes were consistent with varying degrees of truncation compared to wild-type LOS. The LOS structures of each lgt mutant were no longer detected by a monoclonal antibody (MAb 4G5) specific to a highly conserved terminal epitope nor by a monoclonal antibody (MAb 3F7) specific to the serotype B LOS side chain. Mass spectrometry of the LOS glycoforms assembled by two of these lgt mutants indicated that lgt1 encodes an alpha(1-2) glucosyltransferase and the lgt2 encodes a beta(1-4) galactosyltransferase. However, these structural studies could not delineate the function for lgt3. Therefore, M. catarrhalis lgt3 was introduced into a defined beta(1-4) glucosyltransferase <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> 35000glu- mutant in trans, and monoclonal antibody analysis confirmed that Lgt3 complemented the LOS defect. These data suggest that lgt3 encodes a glucosyltransferase involved in the addition of a beta(1-4)-linked glucose to the inner core. Furthermore, we conclude that this enzymatic step is essential for the assembly of the complete LOS glycoform expressed by M. catarrhalis 7169.",M2
15804526,"Induction of apoptosis/necrosis in various human cell lineages by <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> cytolethal distending toxin.We investigated the impact of highly purified Haemophilus ducreyi cytolethal distending toxin (HdCDT) on the apoptosis and necrosis of various human cells; including myeloid cells, epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and primary fibroblasts. The levels of apoptosis and necrosis induced in these cells were compared to those induced by HdCDT in human T cells and in the Jurkat T cell line. Levels of caspase-3 activity were measured, and membrane changes like phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation was evaluated after double-staining with the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) using flow cytometry. HdCDT induced various degrees of apoptosis and necrosis in dose- and time-dependent manners in cells of various lineages. Early and late apoptosis (annexin V-stained cells) were induced in more than 90% of T cells and monocytes after treatment with 100 ng/ml HdCDT for 24 and 48 h, respectively. The corresponding numbers for epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts were 26-32% after treatment with 100 ng/ml HdCDT for 48 h. HdCDT appears to eliminate effectively by inducing apoptosis those cells that are involved in immune responses. Epithelial cells, keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which are important for the healing of chancroid ulcers, are eliminated by apoptosis or necrosis after contact with HdCDT, albeit slower and to a lesser extent than T cells.",M2
15784585,"<e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> Outer membrane determinants, including DsrA, define two clonal populations.The Haemophilus ducreyi outer membrane component DsrA (for ducreyi serum resistance A) is necessary for complete resistance to normal human serum (NHS). When DsrA expression in 19 temporally and geographically diverse clinical isolates of H. ducreyi was examined by Western blotting, 5 of the strains expressed a different immunotype of the DsrA protein (DsrA(II)) than the well-characterized prototypical strain 35000HP (DsrA(I)). The predicted DsrA proteins expressed by the DsrA(II) strains were 100% identical to each other but only 48% identical to that of strain 35000HP. In addition to the DsrA(II) protein, class II strains also expressed variant forms of other outer membrane proteins (OMPs) including NcaA (necessary for collagen adhesion A), DltA (ducreyi lectin A), Hlp (H. ducreyi lipoprotein), major OMP, and/or OmpA2 (for OMP A2) and synthesized a distinct, faster-migrating lipooligosaccharide. Based on these data, strains expressing DsrA(I) were termed class I, and those expressing DsrA(II) were termed class II. Expression of dsrA(II) from strain CIP 542 ATCC in the class I dsrA(I) mutant FX517 (35000HP background), which does not express a DsrA protein, rendered this strain resistant to 50% NHS. This demonstrates that DsrA(II) protein is also critical to serum resistance. Taken together, these results indicate that there are two clonal populations of H. ducreyi. The implications of two classes of H. ducreyi strains differing in important antigenic outer membrane components are discussed.",M2
15555881,"Porphyrin-based compounds exert antibacterial action against the sexually transmitted pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.A series of porphyrin based compounds without (nMP) or with (MP) metals were found to have potent bactericidal action in vitro against the sexually transmitted pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus ducreyi. nMP and MP did not show bactericidal activity against five species of lactobacilli. An MP containing gallium had the capacity to block a gonococcal infection in a murine vaginal model, indicating that its development as a topical microbicide to block sexually transmitted bacterial infections is warranted. In contrast to other bacterial species, loss of the gonococcal haemoglobin uptake system encoded by hpuB or energy supplied through the TonB-ExbB-ExbD system did not significantly affect levels of MP-susceptibility in gonococci. In contrast, mutations in gonococci that inactivate the mtrCDE-encoded efflux pump were found to enhance gonococcal susceptibility to nMPs and MPs while over-production of this efflux pump decreased levels of gonococcal susceptibility to these compounds.",M2
15501753,"Differential expression of porins OmpP2A and OmpP2B of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.Haemophilus ducreyi is a strict human pathogen and the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid. The genome of the human-passaged strain of H. ducreyi (35000HP) contains two homologous genes whose protein products have estimated molecular masses of 46 and 43 kDa. A comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that these proteins share 27 to 33% identity to the outer membrane protein P2 (OmpP2), a major porin of Haemophilus influenzae. Therefore, these proteins have been designated OmpP2A and OmpP2B, respectively. The detection of ompP2A and ompP2B transcripts by reverse transcriptase PCR indicated that these genes were independently transcribed in H. ducreyi 35000HP. Western blot analysis of outer membrane proteins isolated from a geographically diverse collection of H. ducreyi clinical isolates revealed that OmpP2A and OmpP2B were differentially expressed among these strains. Although PCR analysis suggested that ompP2A and ompP2B were conserved among the strains tested, the differential expression observed was due to nucleotide additions and partial gene deletions. Purified OmpP2A and OmpP2B were isolated under nondenaturing conditions, and subsequent analysis demonstrated that these two proteins exhibited porin activity. OmpP2A and OmpP2B are the first porins described for H. ducreyi.",M2
15488736,"Interactions of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> and purified cytolethal distending toxin with human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, macrophages and CD4+ T cells.To evaluate the early stages of the host response to chancroid bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi, we investigated the in vitro responses of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (MQs) to this pathogen and Haemophilus influenzae. The phagocytic activities and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion profiles of the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were analyzed after exposure to gentamycin-killed bacteria, H. ducreyi lipooligosaccharide (LOS), and purified cytolethal distending toxin (HdCDT). T-cell proliferation and cytokine release were examined after co-culturing isolated autologous CD4+ T cells with antigen-pulsed APCs. Both the DCs and MQs phagocytosed H. ducreyi and H. influenzae, as estimated by flow cytometry. All of the strains induced APC secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12, as measured by ELISA. Other human cells, particularly endothelial cells and fibroblasts, also produced cytokines when stimulated with these bacteria. Purified LOS at concentration 1 microg/ml induced two to threefold lower levels of cytokines than the whole bacteria, which indicates that other components are involved in immune activation. HdCDT inhibited partially the production of the aforementioned cytokines. High levels of IFN-gamma, but not of IL-4 and IL-13, were secreted by T cells after activation by either DCs or MQs that were pre-exposed to bacteria, indicating the Th1 nature of the immune response. The levels of T-cell proliferation induced by H. ducreyi were lower than those induced by H. influenzae. HdCDT-treated APCs did not display cytokine responses or T-cell proliferation. These results indicate that HdCDT intoxication, which results in progressive apoptosis of APCs, may hamper early stage immune responses.",M2
15164065,"Assembly and function of a bacterial genotoxin.The tripartite cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in eukaryotic cells. The subunits CdtA and CdtC associate with the nuclease CdtB to form a holotoxin that translocates CdtB into the host cell, where it acts as a genotoxin by creating DNA lesions. Here we show that the crystal structure of the holotoxin from <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> reveals that CDT consists of an enzyme of the DNase-I family, bound to two ricin-like lectin domains. CdtA, CdtB and CdtC form a ternary complex with three interdependent molecular interfaces, characterized by globular, as well as extensive non-globular, interactions. The lectin subunits form a deeply grooved, highly aromatic surface that we show to be critical for toxicity. The holotoxin possesses a steric block of the CdtB active site by means of a non-globular extension of the CdtC subunit, and we identify putative DNA binding residues in CdtB that are essential for toxin activity.",M2
15155648,"A novel lectin, DltA, is required for expression of a full serum resistance phenotype in <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.Haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of chancroid, is highly resistant to the complement-mediated bactericidal activity of normal human serum (NHS). Previously, we identified DsrA (for ducreyi serum resistance A), a major factor required for expression of the serum resistance phenotype in H. ducreyi. We describe here a second outer membrane protein, DltA (for ducreyi lectin A), which also contributes to serum resistance in H. ducreyi. Isogenic dltA mutants, constructed in 35000HP wild-type and FX517 dsrA backgrounds, were more susceptible to the bactericidal effects of NHS than each respective parent, demonstrating the additive effect of the mutations. Furthermore, expression of dltA in H. influenzae strain Rd rendered this highly susceptible strain partially resistant to 5% NHS compared to a vector-control strain. Although primary basic local alignment search tool analysis of the dltA open reading frame revealed no close bacterial homologue, similarity to the beta-chain of the eukaryotic lectin ricin was noted. DltA shares highly conserved structural motifs with the ricin beta chain, such as cysteines and lectin-binding domains. To determine whether dltA was a lectin, ligand blots and affinity chromatography experiments were performed. DltA was affinity purified on immobilized lactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, and N-glycosylated but not glycosidase-treated model glycoproteins bound DltA. These data indicate that DltA is a lectin with specificity for lactose-related carbohydrates (CHO) and is important for H. ducreyi serum resistance.",M2

14582649,"Proteome of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> by 2-D SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry: strain variation, virulence, and carbohydrate expression.We have analyzed the proteome of several strains of Haemophilus ducreyi by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry. Over 100 spots were analyzed from the soluble and insoluble protein fractions from the prototype strain 35000HP and 122 distinct proteins were identified. Functions of approximately 80% of the 122 proteins were deduced by identification with close homologues of Haemophilus influenzae. Four additional wild type and three mutant strains were also analyzed that vary in their virulence and/or outer-membrane lipooligosaccharide structures. Overall, the 2-DE gel maps of the wild type and mutant strains were similar to strain 35000HP, suggesting little proteome diversity in relation to carbohydrate expression and/or virulence. An exception was the Kenyan strain 33921 which contained significant differences in its proteome 2-DE map and also synthesizes an unusual LOS with a trisaccharide branch structure. This African strain may represent a prototype of a second clonal group of H. ducreyi.",M2

In a reinfection trial, 2 of 11 previous pustule formers and 6 of 10 previous resolvers resolved all sites of infection. There was no correlation between serum bactericidal or phagocytic activity and outcome in the trial. These data indicate that different hosts are differentially susceptible to disease progression versus resolution in the model.",M2
14573688,"A CdtA-CdtC complex can block killing of HeLa cells by <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> cytolethal distending toxin.The cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) of Haemophilus ducreyi is comprised of the CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC proteins, with the CdtB protein having demonstrated enzymatic (i.e., DNase) activity. Using a single recombinant Escherichia coli strain with two plasmids individually containing the H. ducreyi cdtA and cdtC genes, we purified a noncovalent CdtA-CdtC complex. Incubation of this CdtA-CdtC complex with HeLa cells blocked killing of these cells by CDT holotoxin. Furthermore, the addition of purified recombinant CdtB to HeLa cells preincubated with the CdtA-CdtC complex resulted in the killing of these human epithelial cells.",M2
14500520,"Inhibition of phagocytosis by <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> requires expression of the LspA1 and LspA2 proteins.Haemophilus ducreyi previously has been shown to inhibit the phagocytosis of both secondary targets and itself by certain cells in vitro. Wild-type H. ducreyi strain 35000HP contains two genes, lspA1 and lspA2, whose encoded protein products are predicted to be 456 and 543 kDa, respectively. An isogenic mutant of H. ducreyi 35000HP with inactivated lspA1 and lspA2 genes has been shown to exhibit substantially decreased virulence in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for chancroid. This lspA1 lspA2 mutant was tested for its ability to inhibit phagocytosis of immunoglobulin G-opsonized particles by differentiated HL-60 and U-937 cells and by J774A.1 cells. The wild-type strain H. ducreyi 35000HP readily inhibited phagocytosis, whereas the lspA1 lspA2 mutant was unable to inhibit phagocytosis. Similarly, the wild-type strain was resistant to phagocytosis, whereas the lspA1 lspA2 mutant was readily engulfed by phagocytes. This inhibitory effect of wild-type H. ducreyi on phagocytic activity was primarily associated with live bacterial cells but could also be found, under certain conditions, in concentrated H. ducreyi culture supernatant fluids that lacked detectable outer membrane fragments. Both the wild-type strain and the lspA1 lspA2 mutant attached to phagocytes at similar levels. These results indicate that the LspA1 and LspA2 proteins of H. ducreyi are involved, directly or indirectly, in the antiphagocytic activity of this pathogen, and they provide a possible explanation for the greatly reduced virulence of the lspA1 lspA2 mutant.",M2
12969375,"The <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> cytolethal distending toxin induces DNA double-strand breaks and promotes ATM-dependent activation of RhoA.Among bacterial protein toxins, the cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) are unique in their ability to activate the DNA damage checkpoint responses, causing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in intoxicated cells. We provide direct evidence that natural intoxication of cells with the Haemophilus ducreyi CDT (HdCDT) holotoxin induces DNA double-strand breaks similarly to ionizing radiation. Upon DNA damage, epithelial cells and fibroblasts promote the formation of actin stress fibres via activation of the small GTPase RhoA. This phenomenon is not toxin specific, but is part of the ATM-induced cellular responses to genotoxic stresses, including ionizing radiation. Activation of RhoA is associated with prolonged cell survival, as HdCDT-treated epithelial cells expressing a dominant-negative form of RhoA detach and consequently die faster than cells expressing a functional RhoA. Our data highlight several novel aspects of CDT biology: (i) we show that a member of the CDT family causes DNA double-strand breaks in naturally intoxicated cells, acting as a true genotoxic agent; and (ii) we disclose the existence of a novel signalling pathway for intracellularly triggered activation of the RhoA GTPase via the ATM kinase in response to DNA damage, possibly required to prolong cell survival.",M2
12704119,"Mutations in the lspA1 and lspA2 genes of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> affect the virulence of this pathogen in an animal model system.Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HP contains two genes, lspA1 and lspA2, whose predicted protein products have molecular weights of 456,000 and 543,000, respectively (C. K. Ward, S. R. Lumbley, J. L. Latimer, L. D. Cope, and E. J. Hansen, J. Bacteriol. 180:6013-6022, 1998). We have constructed three H. ducreyi 35000HP mutants containing antibiotic resistance cartridges in one or both of the lspA1 and lspA2 open reading frames. Western blot analysis using LspA1- and LspA2-specific monoclonal antibodies indicated that the wild-type parent strain 35000HP expressed LspA1 protein that was readily detectable in culture supernatant fluid together with a barely detectable amount of LspA2 protein. The lspA2 mutant 35000HP.2 expressed LspA1 protein that was detectable in culture supernatant fluid and no LspA2 protein. In contrast, the H. ducreyi lspA1 mutant 35000HP.1, which did not express the LspA1 protein, expressed a greater quantity of the LspA2 protein than did the wild-type parent strain. The lspA1 lspA2 double mutant 35000HP.12 expressed neither LspA1 nor LspA2. The three mutant strains adhered to human foreskin fibroblasts and to a human keratinocyte cell line in vitro at a level that was not significantly different from that of the wild-type strain 35000HP. Lack of expression of the LspA1 protein by both the lspA1 mutant and the lspA1 lspA2 double mutant was associated with an increased tendency to autoagglutinate. When evaluated in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for chancroid, the lspA1 lspA2 double mutant was substantially less virulent than the wild-type strain 35000HP. The results of these studies indicated that H. ducreyi requires both the LspA1 and LspA2 proteins to be fully virulent in this animal model for experimental chancroid.",M2
12615992,"Metabolic incorporation of unnatural sialic acids into <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> lipooligosaccharides.The lipooligosaccharides (LOS) of Haemophilus ducreyi are highly sialylated, a modification that has been implicated in resistance to host defense and in virulence. In previous work, we demonstrated that H. ducreyi scavenges sialic acid from the extracellular milieu and incorporates those residues into LOS. Here we report that H. ducreyi can use unnatural sialic acids bearing elongated N-acyl groups from three to seven carbon atoms in length, resulting in outer membrane presentation of unnatural sialyl-LOS. The unnatural variant comprises approximately 90% of cell surface sialosides when exogenous substrates are added to the media at micromolar concentrations, despite the availability of natural sialic acid in the growth media. Although they represent the majority of cell surface sialosides, analogs with longer N-acyl groups diminish the overall level of LOS sialylation, culminating in complete inhibition of LOS sialylation by N-octanoyl sialic acid. Thus, sialylation of H. ducreyi LOS can be modulated with respect to the structure of the terminal sialic acid residue and the extent to which the LOS acceptor is modified by supplying the bacteria with various sialic acid analogs.",M2
12567167,"Etiology of genital ulcer disease and association with human immunodeficiency virus infection in two tanzanian cities.BACKGROUND: The etiological agent is usually not established in cases of genital ulcer disease (GUD) in Tanzania, since diagnosis and treatment of this disease are based mainly on clinical rather than microbiologic parameters. GUD increases the risk of infection with HIV. However, the association between specific GUD infections and HIV infection has not been fully investigated. GOAL: The goal was to determine the etiology of GUD and the prevalence of HIV infection in patients with GUD in urban areas of Tanzania. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 102 clinical specimens were collected from 52 and 50 patients with GUD in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, respectively, and from 93 patients with genital discharge in a cross-sectional study. Two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used to identify either a single target DNA or all three DNAs of the major causes of GUD: <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, Treponema palladum and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). The sera from all patients were tested for antibodies to HIV and T palladum. RESULTS: In Dar es Salaam, DNA from HSV-2, and was detected in 63%, 13%, and 2%, respectively, of the 52 genital ulcer specimens. The corresponding figures in Mbeya were 34%, 10%, and 0% of 50 specimens. Overall, 9% of the 102 patients with GUD were infected with both HSV-2 and, and 39/102 genital ulcer specimens (38%) were negative for the DNA of all three pathogens. The HIV infection rates among GUD patients were 46% and 52% in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, respectively; among the non-GUD patients, the corresponding rates were 35% and 45%, respectively. The HIV infection rate in Dar es Salaam was significantly higher among women (11/14; 78%) than among men (13/38; 34%) (P = 0.004). Among the HIV-seropositive GUD patients, 71% and 46% (P &lt; 0.003) were coinfected with HSV-2 in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, respectively. Furthermore, women with HSV-2 in Dar es Salaam were significantly more likely to be HIV-infected than men (60% versus 39%; P&lt;or= 0.006). antibodies were detected in 27 (26%) of the 102 GUD patients and 16 (17%) of the 93 non-GUD patients. CONCLUSION: HSV-2 was the most commonly identified agent in the genital ulcer specimens in two urban STD clinics in Tanzania. The prevalence of HIV was high among the STD patients. HSV-2 was detected at significantly higher rates among HIV-seropositive than HIV-seronegative patients with GUD in both Dar es Salaam and Mbeya.",M2
12379693,"The <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> serum resistance antigen DsrA confers attachment to human keratinocytes.Haemophilus ducreyi is the etiologic agent of the sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease chancroid. H. ducreyi serum resistance protein A (DsrA) is a member of a family of multifunctional outer membrane proteins that are involved in resistance to killing by human serum complement. The members of this family include YadA of Yersinia species, the UspA proteins of Moraxella catarrhalis, and the Eib proteins of Escherichia coli. The role of YadA, UspA1, and UspA2H as eukaryotic cell adhesins and the function of UspA2 as a vitronectin binder led to our investigation of the cell adhesion and vitronectin binding properties of DsrA. We found that DsrA was a keratinocyte-specific adhesin as it was necessary and sufficient for attachment to HaCaT cells, a keratinocyte cell line, but was not required for attachment to HS27 cells, a fibroblast cell line. We also found that DsrA was specifically responsible for the ability of H. ducreyi to bind vitronectin. We then theorized that DsrA might use vitronectin as a bridge to bind to human cells, but this hypothesis proved to be untrue as eliminating HaCaT cell binding of vitronectin with a monoclonal antibody specific to integrin alpha(v)beta(5) did not affect the attachment of H. ducreyi to HaCaT cells. Finally, we wanted to examine the importance of keratinocyte adhesion in chancroid pathogenesis so we tested the wild-type and dsrA mutant strains of H. ducreyi in our swine models of chancroid pathogenesis. The dsrA mutant was less virulent than the wild type in both the normal and immune cell-depleted swine models of chancroid infection.",M2
12228324,"Identification and characterization of the N-acetylglucosamine glycosyltransferase gene of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.Haemophilus ducreyi is the causative agent of chancroid, a sexually transmitted ulcerative disease. In the present study, the Neisseria gonorrhoeae lgtA lipooligosaccharide glycosyltransferase gene was used to identify a homologue in the genome of H. ducreyi. The putative H. ducreyi glycosyltransferase gene (designated lgtA) was cloned and insertionally inactivated, and an isogenic mutant was constructed. Structural studies demonstrated that the lipooligosaccharide isolated from the mutant strain lacked N-acetylglucosamine and distal sugars found in the lipooligosaccharide produced by the parental strain. The isogenic mutant was transformed with a recombinant plasmid containing the putative glycosyltransferase gene. This strain produced the lipooligosaccharide glycoforms produced by the parental strain, confirming that the lgtA gene encodes the N-acetylglucosamine glycosyltransferase.",M2

12100552,"CpsK of Streptococcus agalactiae exhibits alpha2,3-sialyltransferase activity in <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) is a major cause of serious newborn bacterial infections. Crucial to GBS evasion of host immunity is the production of a capsular polysaccharide (CPS) decorated with sialic acid, which inactivates the alternative complement pathway. The CPS operons of serotypes Ia and III GBS have been described, but the CPS sialyltransferase gene was not identified. We identified cpsK, an open reading frame in the CPS operon of most serotypes, which was homologous to the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) sialyltransferase gene, lst, of Haemophilus ducreyi. To determine if cpsK might encode a sialyltransferase, we complemented a H. ducreyi lst mutant with cpsK. CpsK was expressed in H. ducreyi and LOS was isolated and analysed for sialic acid content by SDS-PAGE and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Sialo-LOS was seen in the wild-type, cpsK- or lst-complemented mutant strains, but not in the mutant without cpsK. Addition of Neu5Ac to the LOS was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Lectin binding studies detected terminal Neu5Ac(alpha 2--&gt;3)Gal(beta 1- on LOS produced by the wild-type, cpsK or lst-complemented mutant strain LOS, compared with the mutant alone. Our data characterize the first sialyltransferase gene from a Gram- positive bacterium and provide compelling evidence that its product catalyses the alpha2,3 addition of Neu5Ac to H. ducreyi LOS and therefore the terminal side-chain of GBS CPS. Phylogenetic studies further indicated that lst and cpsK are related but distinct from sialyltransferases of most other bacteria and, along with their similar codon usage bias and G + C content, suggests acquisition by lateral transfer from an ancestral low G + C organism.",M2
12056572,"Characterization of lipooligosaccharides from <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> containing polylactosamine repeats.Haemophilus ducreyi, a gram-negative human mucosal pathogen, is one of the principal causes of genital ulcer disease. The lipooligosaccharides (LOS) of these bacteria are considered to be a major virulence factor and have been implicated in the adherence and invasion of H. ducreyi to several human cell types. An isogenic heptosyltransferase-III knockout strain (waaQ) was recently constructed from H. ducreyi 35000 wild-type strain and immunochemical and molecular weight data of the isolated LOS suggested the presence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) (Filiatrault et al., Infect. Immun. 2000, 68, 3352-3361). In this present study, the structures of these novel LOS-glycoforms were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry in combination with exoglycosidase digestion. Detailed structural information was obtained for the oligosaccharide (OS) portions of these LOS showing between one to five linear LacNAc repeats on the non-reducing terminus of the main oligosaccharide branch. When grown on solid media, the organism produced LacNAc repeats that were further modified by the addition of sialic acid. Enzymatic digestion with beta-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase, and neuraminidase type VI-A yielded truncated glycoforms consistent with a polyLacNAc structure capped at various end points with sialic acid. ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry on a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument was particularly effective in obtaining detailed structural information on the least abundant, high-mass glycoforms. Although LOS containing terminal di-LacNAc have been reported, this is the first time to our knowledge that a linear polyLacNAc structure has been characterized in bacteria.",M2
12010986,"<e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> requires the flp gene cluster for microcolony formation in vitro.Haemophilus ducreyi, the etiologic agent of chancroid, has been shown to form microcolonies when cultured in the presence of human foreskin fibroblasts. We identified a 15-gene cluster in H. ducreyi that encoded predicted protein products with significant homology to those encoded by the tad (for tight adhesion) locus in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans that is involved in the production of fimbriae by this periodontal pathogen. The first three open reading frames in this H. ducreyi gene cluster encoded predicted proteins with a high degree of identity to the Flp (fimbria-like protein) encoded by the first open reading frame of the tad locus; this 15-gene cluster in H. ducreyi was designated flp. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the H. ducreyi flp gene cluster was likely to be a polycistronic operon. Mutations within the flp gene cluster resulted in an inability to form microcolonies in the presence of human foreskin fibroblasts. In addition, the same mutants were defective in the ability to attach to both plastic and human foreskin fibroblasts in vitro. An H. ducreyi mutant with an inactivated tadA gene exhibited a small decrease in virulence in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for experimental chancroid, whereas another H. ducreyi mutant with inactivated flp-1 and flp-2 genes was as virulent as the wild-type parent strain. These results indicate that the flp gene cluster is essential for microcolony formation by H. ducreyi, whereas this phenotypic trait is not linked to the virulence potential of the pathogen, at least in this animal model of infection.",M2
12010972,"The lbgAB gene cluster of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> encodes a beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase and an alpha-1,6-DD-heptosyltransferase involved in lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis.All Haemophilus ducreyi strains examined contain a lipooligosaccharide (LOS) consisting of a single but variable branch oligosaccharide that emanates off the first heptose (Hep-I) of a conserved Hep(3)-phosphorylated 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid-lipid A core. In a previous report, identification of tandem genes, lbgA and lbgB, that are involved in LOS biosynthesis was described (Stevens et al., Infect. Immun. 65:651-660, 1997). In a separate study, the same gene cluster was identified and the lbgB (losB) gene was found to be required for transfer of the second sugar, D-glycero-D-manno-heptose (DD-Hep), of the major branch structure (Gibson et al., J. Bacteriol. 179:5062-5071, 1997). In this study, we identified the function of the neighboring upstream gene, lbgA, and found that it is necessary for addition of the third sugar in the dominant oligosaccharide branch, a galactose-linked beta1--&gt;4, to the DD-Hep. LOS from an lbgA mutant and an lbgAB double mutant were isolated and were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, carbohydrate analysis, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results showed that the mutant strains synthesize truncated LOS glycoforms that terminate after addition of the first glucose (lbgAB) or the disaccharide DD-Hepalpha1--&gt;6Glcbeta1 (lbgA) that is attached to the heptose core. Both mutants show a significant reduction in the ability to adhere to human keratinocytes. Although minor differences were observed after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of total proteins from the wild-type and mutant strains, the expression levels of the vast majority of proteins were unchanged, suggesting that the differences in adherence and invasion are due to differences in LOS. These studies add to the mounting evidence for a role of full-length LOS structures in the pathophysiology of H. ducreyi infection.",M2
11984440,"Epidemic Lymphogranuloma venereum during epidemics of crack cocaine use and HIV infection in the Bahamas.BACKGROUND: Since the early 1980s, the Bahamas has experienced sequential epidemics of freebase/crack cocaine use, genital ulcer-inguinal adenopathy disease (GUD), and heterosexual HIV infection. GOAL: To prospectively define the etiology of GUD in patients at the Princess Margaret Hospital during outbreaks of crack cocaine use, GUD, and HIV infection in the Bahamas. STUDY DESIGN: In Nassau, 47 consecutive patients with GUD underwent serologic testing for syphilis and for infections with HIV, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and Chlamydia trachomatis. Genital ulcer specimens were tested by culture and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>; by PCR and/or antigen assay for HSV; and by PCR for C trachomatis. Lymph node aspirates were tested by PCR for C trachomatis and H ducreyi. RESULTS: Twenty patients (43%) had HIV infection; eight had lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), confirmed by PCR detection of C trachomatis sequences consistent with the L2 serovar; and nine others had possible LGV, on the basis of serum microimmunofluorescent C trachomatis antibody titers &gt; or =256. Inguinal lymphadenopathy or bubo was present in 15 of 17 patients, who thus met the laboratory criteria for definite or possible LGV, and in 7 of 30 who did not meet such laboratory criteria (P &lt; 0.001). Thirteen patients had confirmed genital herpes, seven had confirmed chancroid, and four had probable or possible primary syphilis.

We demonstrate that the Haemophilus ducreyi CDT (HdCDT) induces phosphorylation of the histone H2AX as early as 1 h after intoxication and re-localization of the DNA repair complex Mre11 in HeLa cells with kinetics similar to those observed upon ionizing radiation. Early phosphorylation of H2AX was dependent on a functional Ataxia Telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. Microinjection of a His-tagged HdCdtB subunit, homologous to the mammalian DNase I, was sufficient to induce re-localization of the Mre11 complex 1 h post treatment. However, the enzymatic potency was much lower than that exerted by bovine DNase I, which caused marked chromatin changes at 106 times lower concentrations than HdCdtB. H2AX phosphorylation and Mre11 re-localization were induced also in HdCDT-treated, non-proliferating dendritic cells (DCs) in a differentiation dependent manner, and resulted in cell death. The data highlight several novel aspects of CDTs biology. We demonstrate that the toxin activates DNA damage-associated molecules in an ATM-dependent manner, both in proliferating and non-proliferating cells, acting as other DNA damaging agents. Induction of apoptotic death of immature DCs by HdCDT may represent a previously unknown mechanism of immune evasion by CDT-producing microbes.",M2
11890549,"Cytolethal distending toxins and activation of DNA damage-dependent checkpoint responses.Cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) are unique among bacterial protein toxins in their ability to cause DNA damage, due to their functional similarity to the mammalian deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I). The cellular response to CDT intoxication is characterised by activation of DNA damage-induced checkpoint responses, and the final outcome is cell type dependent. Cells of epithelial origin and normal keratinocytes are arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, normal fibroblasts are also arrested in G1, while B cells die of apoptosis. CDTs are encoded by three linked genes (cdtA, cdtB and cdtC), and CdtB is the toxin subunit which possesses the DNase I-like activity. All the three genes have to be present in the bacterium in order to produce an active cytotoxin, however cytotoxic <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> CDT, purified from a CdtABC recombinant E. coli strain, contains the CdtB and CdtC subunits, suggesting that they constitute the holotoxin and that CdtC may be required for CdtB internalization.

11854222,"A superoxide dismutase C mutant of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> is virulent in human volunteers.Haemophilus ducreyi produces a periplasmic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD), which is thought to protect the organism from exogenous reactive oxygen species generated by neutrophils during an inflammatory response. We had previously identified the gene, sodC, responsible for the production and secretion of Cu-Zn SOD and constructed an isogenic H. ducreyi strain with a mutation in the sodC gene (35000HP-sodC-cat). Compared to the parent, the mutant does not survive in the presence of exogenous superoxide (L. R. San Mateo, M. Hobbs, and T. H. Kawula, Mol. Microbiol. 27:391-404, 1998) and is impaired in the swine model of H. ducreyi infection (L. R. San Mateo, K. L. Toffer, P. E. Orndorff, and T. H. Kawula, Infect. Immun. 67:5345-5351, 1999). To test whether Cu-Zn SOD is important for bacterial survival in vivo, six human volunteers were experimentally infected with 35000HP and 35000HP-sodC-cat and observed for papule and pustule formation. Papules developed at similar rates at sites inoculated with the mutant or parent. The pustule formation rates were 75% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 43 to 95%) at 12 parent-inoculated sites and 67% (95% CI, 41 to 88%) at 18 mutant-inoculated sites (P = 0.47). There was no significant difference in levels of H. ducreyi recovery from mutant- and parent-inoculated biopsy sites. These results suggest that expression of Cu-Zn SOD does not play a major role in the survival of this pathogen in the initial stages of experimental infection of humans.",M2
11601991,"Biosynthesis of sialylated lipooligosaccharides in <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> is dependent on exogenous sialic acid and not mannosamine. Incorporation studies using N-acylmannosamine analogues, N-glycolylneuraminic acid, and 13C-labeled N-acetylneuraminic acid.Haemophilus ducreyi is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes chancroid, a sexually transmitted disease. Cell surface lipooligosaccharides (LOS) of H. ducreyi are thought to play important biological roles in host infection. The vast majority of H. ducreyi strains contain high levels of sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, NeuAc) in their LOS. Here we investigate the biosynthetic origin of H. ducreyi sialosides by metabolic incorporation studies using a panel of N-acylmannosamine and sialic acid analogues. Incorporation of sialosides into LOS was assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. A Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer provided accurate mass measurements, and a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument was used to obtain characteristic fragment ions and partial carbohydrate sequences. Exogenously supplied N-acetylmannosamine analogues were not converted to LOS-associated sialosides at a detectable level. In contrast, exogenous (13)C-labeled N-acetylneuraminic acid ([(13)C]NeuAc) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) were efficiently incorporated into LOS in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, approximately 1.3 microM total exogenous sialic acid was sufficient to obtain about 50% of the maximum production of sialic acid-containing glycoforms observed under in vitro growth conditions. Together, these data suggest that the expressed levels of sialylated LOS glycoforms observed in H. ducreyi are in large part controlled by the exogenous concentrations of sialic acid and at levels one might expect in vivo. Moreover, these studies show that to properly exploit the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway for metabolic oligosaccharide engineering in H. ducreyi and possibly other prokaryotes that share similar pathways, precursors based on sialic acid and not mannosamine must be used.",M2
11570857,"Purification and characterization of a beta-lactamase from <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> in Escherichia coli.A pCb plasmid encoding a beta-lactamase from Haemophilus ducreyi was transferred to Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. The beta-lactamase could be isolated from a culture filtrate and further purified by ammonium sulfate and chelating Sepharose fast flow loaded with Zn(2+). The purified enzyme resulted in a major band at approximately 30-kDa on SDS-PAGE and its pI was determined to be 5.4. The beta-lactamase could hydrolyze both penicillin antibiotics including ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, and carbenicillin as well as cephalosporin antibiotics including nitrocefin, cephalothin, cephaloridine, and cefoperazone. However, benzylpenicillin was the best substrate. The enzyme activity was inhibited by clavulanic acid but not by boric acid, cefotaxime, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The sequence of the beta-lactamase gene was also determined. It confirmed that the enzyme belonged to a class A beta-lactamase which had 99% identity to the ampicillin resistance transposon Tn3 of pBR322. Two nucleotides were different between the E. coli (Tn3) and H. ducreyi (pCb) genes that affected the amino-acid sequence. The valine at position 82 (ABL 84) was changed to isoleucine and the alanine at position 182 (ABL 184) was changed to valine. Genetic homogeneity among beta-lactamases is remarkable. Amino acid sequencing of some beta-lactamases has shown that substitution of only a few amino acids in the bla gene leads to high-level resistance against specific cephalosporins.",M2
11544241,"Genetic analysis of a pyocin-resistant lipooligosaccharide (LOS) mutant of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>: restoration of full-length LOS restores pyocin sensitivity.DNA sequence and Southern blot analyses were used to determine the genetic defect of a Haemophilus ducreyi pyocin-resistant lipooligosaccharide (LOS) mutant, HD35000R. The region of the HD35000R chromosome containing the suspected mutation was amplified, and sequence analysis detected a 3,189-bp deletion. This deletion resulted in the loss of the entire waaQ gene, another open reading frame that encodes a putative homolog to a hypothetical protein (HI0461) of H. influenzae, the gene encoding an argininosuccinate synthase homolog, and a change in the 3' sequence of the lgtF gene. Southern blot analysis confirmed that no genomic rearrangements had occurred. Isogenic LOS mutants and the respective complemented mutants were evaluated for susceptibility to pyocin C. The mutants expressing truncated LOS were resistant to lysis by pyocin C, and complementation restored sensitivity to the pyocin. We conclude that HD35000R is defective in both glycosyltransferase genes and that pyocin resistance is due to truncation of the full-length LOS molecule.",M2
11520032,"Calorimetric analysis of cephalosporins using an immobilized TEM-1 beta-lactamase on Ni2+ chelating sepharose fast flow.Two beta-lactamases, penicillinase type I from Bacillus cereus and TEM-1 beta-lactamase from <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, were immobilized on a Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column loaded with Ni2+ in an active form. Flow-injection analysis of beta-lactams was performed by using an enzyme column reactor fitted into the enzyme thermistor. With both enzymes it was possible to monitor both penicillins and cephalosporins. Moreover, Michaelis constants of the TEM-1 beta-lactamase were markedly increased upon immobilization for all substrates, especially carbenicillin, cephaloridine, and cefoperazone.",M2
11517937,"Neutrophil degranulation induced by <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.Haemophilus ducreyi is the causative bacterium of genital ulcers, which are collectively known as chancroid. Little is known about the cytotoxicity of H. ducreyi. The virulent strains are relatively resistant to phagocytosis and apoptosis by neutrophils. Therefore, experiments were designed to examine whether neutrophil degranulation caused by H. ducrey would provide insights into the virulence mechanisms through which cellular damage is affected by the organism. Clinical isolates of eight strains of H. ducreyi and the culture strain type CIP542 (Collection Institute Pasteur) were incubated with neutrophils harvested from human donor blood. The release by the organism of lysosomal enzymes from intracellular granules of neutrophils was indicative of degranulation. The results showed that H. ducreyi triggered the release of lysosomal enzymes from human neutrophils, and that the magnitude of the release was dependent both on the ratio of bacteria to neutrophils and the duration of incubation. In vitro experiments involving HeLa cells were designed to determine the manner in which H. ducreyi initiated the process of degranulation. The morphological changes associated with degranulation were visualized by confocal and transmission electron microscopy. This is the first report that describes degranulation of neutrophils induced by H. ducreyi which causes chancroid infection.",M2
11453636,"Investigation of the interaction among the components of the cytolethal distending toxin of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.The cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) of Haemophilus ducreyi is encoded by the cdtABC genes, but the composition of active CDT is not known. Both immunoaffinity and metal affinity chromatographic methods were used to purify H. ducreyi CDT from recombinant Escherichia coli strains bearing wild-type or mutated H. ducreyi cdtABC genes. Both affinity-purified preparations contained CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC proteins. These purification efforts also revealed that the formation of a noncovalent CdtB-CdtC complex and production of a fully active CDT complex required the presence of a functional CdtA protein. When purified recombinant CdtB and CdtC proteins were mixed, only very slight CDT activity was detected. In contrast, when a bacterial cell extract containing CdtA was mixed with purified preparations of both CdtB and CdtC, full CDT activity was reconstituted in vitro. These results indicate that CdtA is essential for normal H. ducreyi CDT activity and that CdtA likely modifies or alters either CdtB or CdtC or both to form the active CDT complex.",M2
11401984,"Cloning, overexpression, purification, and immunobiology of an 85-kilodalton outer membrane protein from <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.We have identified an 85-kDa outer membrane protein that is expressed by all tested strains of Haemophilus ducreyi. Studies of related proteins from other pathogenic bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella multocida, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Shigella dysenteriae, suggested a role for these proteins in pathogenesis and immunity. In keeping with the first such described protein from Haemophilus influenzae type B, we termed the H. ducreyi protein D15. The gene encoding the H. ducreyi D15 protein was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence was found to be most similar to sequences of the D15-related proteins from other Pasteurella spp. The arrangement of the flanking genes was similar to that of H. influenzae Rd and suggested that D15 was part of a multigene operon. Attempts to make a null mutation of the D15 gene were unsuccessful, paralleling results in other D15 gene studies. Overexpression of H. ducreyi D15 in Escherichia coli resulted in a source of recombinant D15 (rD15) from which it was readily purified. rD15 was immunogenic, and it was found that immunization of rabbits with an rD15 vaccine preparation conferred partial protection against a virulent challenge infection. Antisera to an N-terminal peptide recognized all tested strains of H. ducreyi.",M2
11399138,"The role of different protein components from the <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> cytolethal distending toxin in the generation of cell toxicity.Cytolethal distending toxin of Haemophilus ducreyi (HdCDT) is a multicomponent toxin, encoded by an operon consisting of three genes, cdtABC. To investigate the role of the individual products in generation of toxicity, recombinant plasmids were constructed allowing expression of each of the genes individually or in different combinations in Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae. Expression of all three genes (cdtABC) was necessary to generate toxicity on cells, and no activity was obtained using combinations in which only one or two of the genes were expressed. Of the individual gene products, the CdtA was shown to exist in two forms with an MW of 23 and 17 kDa, respectively. The CdtB protein alone resulted in DNase activity. CdtC purified from both toxic and non-toxic extracts (from strains expressing cdtCAB and cdtC, respectively) had a molecular weight of about 20 kDa and reacted with a CdtC-specific monoclonal antibody. However, the protein isoelectric point (pI) of CdtC from toxic preparations was about 1.5 pH units more basic than from non-toxic ones. Both forms were immunogenic giving rise to toxin-neutralizing antibodies. Toxicity was reconstructed by combining non-toxic cell sonicates from E. coli, expressing CdtA, CdtB and CdtC proteins individually. Only combinations including all three products gave toxicity, indicating that all are actively involved in the generation of toxic activity on cells. The reconstruction resulted in a 1.5 pH unit shift in the PI of CdtC, making it identical to that of the protein isolated from bacteria expressing cdtABC. The results showed that the CdtB component produces DNase activity, but cell toxicity depends on the involvement of the other two components of CDT and is associated with absorption of all three proteins by HEp-2 cells.",M2
11369756,"A histidine-rich metal binding domain at the N terminus of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases from pathogenic bacteria: a novel strategy for metal chaperoning.A group of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases from pathogenic bacteria is characterized by histidine-rich N-terminal extensions that are in a highly exposed and mobile conformation. This feature allows these proteins to be readily purified in a single step by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases from both <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> and Haemophilus parainfluenzae display anomalous absorption spectra in the visible region due to copper binding at the N-terminal region. Reconstitution experiments of copper-free enzymes demonstrate that, under conditions of limited copper availability, this metal ion is initially bound at the N-terminal region and subsequently transferred to an active site. Evidence is provided for intermolecular pathways of copper transfer from the N-terminal domain of an enzyme subunit to an active site located on a distinct dimeric molecule. Incubation with EDTA rapidly removes copper bound at the N terminus but is much less effective on the copper ion bound at the active site. This indicates that metal binding by the N-terminal histidines is kinetically favored, but the catalytic site binds copper with higher affinity. We suggest that the histidine-rich N-terminal region constitutes a metal binding domain involved in metal uptake under conditions of metal starvation in vivo. Particular biological importance for this domain is inferred by the observation that its presence enhances the protection offered by periplasmic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase toward phagocytic killing.",M2
11369755,"A novel heme protein, the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.Haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of the genital ulcerative disease known as chancroid, is unable to synthesize heme, which it acquires from humans, its only known host. Here we provide evidence that the periplasmic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from this organism is a heme-binding protein, unlike all the other known Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases from bacterial and eukaryotic species. When the H. ducreyi enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli cells grown in standard LB medium, it contained only limited amounts of heme covalently bound to the polypeptide but was able efficiently to bind exogenously added hemin. Resonance Raman and electronic spectra at neutral pH indicate that H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase contains a 6-coordinated low spin heme, with two histidines as the most likely axial ligands. By site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of a structural model of the enzyme, we identified as a putative axial ligand a histidine residue (His-64) that is present only in the H. ducreyi enzyme and that was located at the bottom of the dimer interface. The introduction of a histidine residue in the corresponding position of the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from Haemophilus parainfluenzae was not sufficient to confer the ability to bind heme, indicating that other residues neighboring His-64 are involved in the formation of the heme-binding pocket. Our results suggest that periplasmic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase plays a role in heme metabolism of H. ducreyi and provide further evidence for the structural flexibility of bacterial enzymes of this class.",M2
11339253,"The effect of temperature on the interaction of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> with human epithelial cells.To investigate if temperature affects the interaction of Haemophilus ducreyi with human epithelial cells, nine strains were used to evaluate the adhesion kinetics of the organism at 33 degrees C and 37 degrees C. The effect of the free toxin on the epithelial cells at those temperatures was also assessed. The cyto-adherence kinetics of H. ducreyi to the epithelial cells was significantly greater at 33 degrees C (10 times more) than at 37 degrees C in all seven clinical isolates tested. There was a significant difference in cell-associated H. ducreyi at 33 degrees C as compared with 37 degrees C. Control strains showed similar adhesion properties at both temperatures. However, the virulent strain CIP542 adhered in larger amounts than the avirulent strain A77. Electron microscopy revealed that there was more tissue necrosis at the lower than the higher temperature. The effect of the free toxin was the same at each temperature. However, strain A77 had significantly lower toxicity than strain CIP542 and the clinical isolates. These results suggest that H. ducreyi displays a temperature-dependent interaction with human epithelial cells, and this feature may play a role in the virulence of the organism in vivo. While the overall toxic effect of viable bacteria depends on the metabolic activity of the bacteria and is, therefore, higher at 33 degrees C than at 37 degrees C withthe same initial inoculum, the effect of the extracted toxin at molecular level with fixed concentrations is a temperature-independent event.",M2
11273741,"The impact of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> cytolethal distending toxin on cells involved in immune response.The Haemophilus ducreyi cytolethal distending toxin (HdCDT) induces cell cycle arrest and thereby inhibits cell proliferation of many cultured mammalian cell-lines. We investigated the effect of HdCDT on circulating human hematopoietic cells, including T- and B-cells, monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). Lymphocytes were stimulated with T- and B-cell specific mitogens, whereas monocytes and PMN with endotoxin. HdCDT inhibited the mitogen-induced proliferation of T-cells in a dose-dependent manner as assayed by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation and MTT assays. Similarly to T-cells, HdCDT also inhibited the proliferation of B-cells and consequently the immunoglobulin production, measured by ELISPOT and ELISA assays. In contrast, the HdCDT did not affect monocytes or PMN, as measured by MTT assay. The TNF-alpha production by monocytes and the phagocytic ability of PMN were neither affected. The monocytic cell line THP-1 was, however, sensitive to the toxin, seen as a reduction of proliferation and viability after exposure to HdCDT. In conclusion, exposure to HdCDT significantly affects the proliferation and other biological activities of stimulated human T- and B-cells, while circulating monocytes and PMN are not sensitive to HdCDT. The sensitivity of cells of the acquired immune system to HdCDT may hamper specific host response to H. ducreyi and contribute to persistence of chancroid lesions.",M2
11254619,"<e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> associates with phagocytes, collagen, and fibrin and remains extracellular throughout infection of human volunteers.In a previous study, Haemophilus ducreyi was found in the pustule and dermis of samples obtained at the clinical end point in the human model of infection. To understand the kinetics of localization, we examined infected sites at 0, 24, and 48 h after inoculation and at the clinical end point. Immediately after inoculation, bacteria were found predominantly in the dermis but also in the epidermis. Few bacteria were detectable at 24 h; however, by 48 h, bacteria were readily seen in the pustule and dermis. H. ducreyi was associated with polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages in the pustule and at its base, but was not associated with T cells, Langerhans' cells, or fibroblasts. H. ducreyi colocalized with collagen and fibrin but not laminin or fibronectin. Association with phagocytes, collagen, and fibrin was seen as early as 48 h and persisted at the pustular stage of disease. Optical sectioning by confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy both failed to demonstrate intracellular H. ducreyi. These data identify collagen and fibrin as potentially important targets of adherence in vivo and strongly suggest that H. ducreyi remains extracellular throughout infection and survives by resisting phagocytic killing in vivo.",M2
11157928,"Identification of a plasmid-encoded gene from <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> which confers NAD independence.Members of the family Pasteurellaceae are classified in part by whether or not they require an NAD supplement for growth on laboratory media. In this study, we demonstrate that this phenotype can be determined by a single gene, nadV, whose presence allows NAD-independent growth of Haemophilus influenzae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. This gene was cloned from a 5.2-kb plasmid which was previously shown to be responsible for NAD independence in Haemophilus ducreyi. When transformed into A. pleuropneumoniae, this cloned gene allowed NAD-independent growth on complex media and allowed the utilization of nicotinamide in place of NAD on defined media. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,482 bp that is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular mass of 55,619 Da. Compared with the sequence databases, NadV was found to have significant sequence homology to the human pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor PBEF and to predicted proteins of unknown function identified in the bacterial species Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Shewanella putrefaciens, Synechocystis sp., Deinococcus radiodurans, Pasteurella multocida, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. P. multocida and A. actinomycetemcomitans are among the NAD-independent members of the Pasteurellaceae. Homologues of NadV were not found in the sequenced genome of H. influenzae, an NAD-dependent member of the Pasteurellaceae, or in species known to utilize a different pathway for synthesis of NAD, such as Escherichia coli. Sequence alignment of these nine homologues revealed regions and residues of complete conservation that may be directly involved in the enzymatic activity. Identification of a function for this gene in the Pasteurellaceae should help to elucidate the role of its homologues in other species.",M2
11083812,"Cellular internalization of cytolethal distending toxin from <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.The chancroid bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi produces a toxin (HdCDT) which is a member of the recently discovered family of cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs). These protein toxins prevent the cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2 from being activated, thus blocking the transition of cells from the G(2) phase into mitosis, with the consequent arrest of intoxicated cells in G(2). It is not known whether these toxins act by signaling from the cell surface or intracellularly only. Here we report that HdCDT has to undergo at least internalization before being able to act. Cellular intoxication was inhibited (i) by removal of clathrin coats via K(+) depletion, (ii) by treatment with drugs that inhibit receptor clustering into coated pits, and (iii) in cells genetically manipulated to fail in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Intoxication was also completely inhibited in cells treated with bafilomycin A1 or nocodazole and in cells incubated at 18 degrees C, i.e., under conditions known to block the fusion of early endosomes with downstream compartments. Moreover, disruption of the Golgi complex by treatment with brefeldin A or ilimaquinone blocked intoxication. In conclusion, our data indicate that HdCDT enters cells via clathrin-coated pits and has to be transported via the Golgi complex in order to intoxicate cells. This is the first member of the family of CDTs for which cellular internalization and some details of the pathway have been demonstrated.",M2
11076947,"The <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> cytolethal distending toxin induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the DNA damage checkpoint pathways.The cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) induce cell cycle arrest by a mechanism still not well characterized. We demonstrate that the effect of the Haemophilus ducreyi CDT (HdCDT) is cell type-specific: B cell lines underwent apoptosis, epithelial cells and keratinocytes arrested exclusively in G(2), whereas normal fibroblasts arrested both in G(1) and G(2). We studied normal keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which are relevant for understanding the pathogenicity of H. ducreyi. The response to HdCDT resembles the checkpoint response activated by ionizing radiation. Both responses were characterized by an early induction of the p53 gene and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in fibroblasts, and activation of the chk2 kinase in epithelial cells. In the Ataxia Telangiectasia-mutated gene (ATM)-deficient lymphoblastoid cell lines, intoxication was significantly delayed compared with ATM wild type cells, and was associated with a slower kinetic of p53 stabilization, suggesting that the early response to HdCDT is ATM-dependent. Activation of ATM-dependent pathways was further confirmed by the ability of caffeine to partially override the HdCDT-mediated cell cycle arrest. Our data shed new light on the mechanism of action of this novel family of bacterial toxins, limiting the target candidates to DNA or molecules directly involved in activation of checkpoint responses.",M2
11035757,"Expression of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein is required for virulence in the human model of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> infection.Haemophilus ducreyi expresses a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) that exhibits extensive homology to Haemophilus influenzae protein 6. We constructed an isogenic PAL mutant (35000HP-SMS4) by the use of a suicide vector that contains lacZ as a counterselectable marker. H. ducreyi 35000HP-SMS4 and its parent, 35000HP, had similar growth rates in broth and similar lipooligosaccharide profiles. 35000HP-SMS4 formed smaller, more transparent colonies than 35000HP and, unlike its parent, was hypersensitive to antibiotics. Complementation of the mutant in trans restored the parental phenotypes. To test whether expression of PAL is required for virulence, nine human volunteers were experimentally infected. Each subject was inoculated with two doses (41 to 89 CFU) of live 35000HP and one dose of heat-killed bacteria on one arm and with three doses (ranging from 28 to 800 CFU) of live 35000HP-SMS4 on the other arm. Papules developed at similar rates at sites inoculated with the mutant or parent but were significantly smaller at mutant-inoculated sites than at parent-inoculated sites. The pustule formation rate was 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46.5 to 90.3%) at 18 parent sites and 11% (95% CI, 2.4 to 29.2%) at 27 mutant sites (P &lt; 0.0001). The rates of recovery of H. ducreyi from surface cultures were 8% (n = 130; 95% CI, 4.3 to 14.6%) for parent-inoculated sites and 0% (n = 120; 95% CI, 0.0 to 2.5%) for mutant-inoculated sites (P &lt; 0.001). H. ducreyi was recovered from six of seven biopsied parent-inoculated sites and from one of three biopsied mutant-inoculated sites. Confocal microscopy confirmed that the bacteria present in a mutant inoculation site pustule lacked a PAL-specific epitope. Although biosafety regulations precluded our testing the complemented mutant in humans, these results suggest that expression of PAL facilitates the ability of H. ducreyi to progress to the pustular stage of disease.",M2
11023070,"Episome profiles and mobilizable beta-lactamase plasmid in <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi has been described as a significantly predisposing factor of HIV heterosexual transmission in an endemic region of both diseases. The fastidious, H. ducreyi has been reported world wide with various antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. A high tendency of drug resistances has generally been found among isolates derived in Thailand. In this study, the plasmids of H. ducreyi were isolated and analysed from 63 clinically derived organisms. Twenty-nine out of 63 isolates (46%) revealed the same plasmid profiles. Plasmid DNA was further cloned into Escherichia coli and transformants were selected. A 3.6 kb plasmid (pCb) carrying ampicillin resistance was subsequently identified. The pCb conferred resistance to various beta-lactam antibiotics including penicillin G, carbenicillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoperazone, ampicillin-sulbactam, and amoxicillin-clavulanate but not to cefoxitin. Co-resistance to streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline was not detected. Beta-lactamase gene was located on the major pCb fragment of EcoRI and AatII cutting.",M2
10735874,"Cloning and characterization of the lipooligosaccharide galactosyltransferase II gene of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.Haemophilus ducreyi is the etiologic agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer disease. The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is considered to be a major virulence determinant and has been implicated in the adherence of H. ducreyi to keratinocytes. Strain A77, an isolate from the Paris collection, is serum sensitive, poorly adherent to fibroblasts, and deficient in microcolony formation. Structural analysis indicates that the LOS of strain A77 lacks the galactose residue found in the N-acetyllactosamine portion of the strain 35000HP LOS as well as the sialic acid substitution. From an H. ducreyi 35000HP genomic DNA library, a clone complementing the defect in A77 was identified by immunologic screening with monoclonal antibody (MAb) 3F11, a MAb which recognizes the N-acetyllactosamine portion of strain 35000HP LOS. The clone contained a 4-kb insert that was sequenced. One open reading frame which encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 33,400 was identified. This protein has homology to glycosyltransferases of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus somnus, Neisseria species, and Pasteurella haemolytica. The putative H. ducreyi glycosyltransferase gene was insertionally inactivated, and an isogenic mutant of strain 35000HP was constructed. The most complex LOS glycoform produced by the mutant has a mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel identical to that of the LOS of strain A77 and lacks the 3F11-binding epitope. Structural studies confirm that the most complex glycoform of the LOS isolated from the mutant lacks the galactose residue found in the N-acetyllactosamine portion of the strain 35000HP LOS. Although previously published data suggested that the serum-sensitive phenotype of A77 was due to the LOS mutation, we observed that the complemented A77 strain retained its serum-sensitive phenotype and that the galactosyltransferase mutant retained its serum-resistant phenotype. Thus, the serum sensitivity of strain A77 cannot be attributed to the galactosyltransferase mutation in strain A77.",M2
10678980,"Serum resistance in <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> requires outer membrane protein DsrA.Haemophilus ducreyi is resistant to killing by normal serum antibody and complement. We discovered an H. ducreyi outer membrane protein required for expression of serum resistance and termed it DsrA (for  ducreyi serum resistance A ). The dsrA locus was cloned, sequenced, and mutagenized. An isogenic mutant (FX517) of parent strain 35000 was constructed and characterized, and it was found to no longer express dsrA. FX517 was at least 10-fold more serum susceptible than 35000. DsrA was expressed by all strains of H. ducreyi tested, except three naturally occurring, avirulent, serum-sensitive strains. FX517 and the three naturally occurring dsrA-nonexpressing strains were complemented in trans with a plasmid expressing dsrA. All four strains were converted to a serum-resistant phenotype, including two that contained truncated lipooligosaccharide (LOS). Therefore, serum resistance in H. ducreyi does not require expression of full-length LOS but does require expression of dsrA. The dsrA locus from eight additional H. ducreyi strains was sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequences were more than 85% identical. The major difference between the DsrA proteins was due to the presence of one, two, or three copies of the heptameric amino acid repeat NTHNINK. These repeats account for the variability in apparent molecular mass of the monomeric form of DsrA (28 to 35 kDa) observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since DsrA is present in virulent strains, is highly conserved, and is required for serum resistance, we speculate that it may be a virulence factor and a potential vaccine candidate.",M2
10569755,"Cytolethal distending toxin of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> induces apoptotic death of Jurkat T cells.The immune response to Haemophilus ducreyi is mediated in part by T cells infiltrating the site of infection. In this study, we show that H. ducreyi antigen preparations inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and primary human T-cell lines. H. ducreyi also inhibited Jurkat T-cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of Jurkat T cells, confirmed through the detection of DNA degradation and membrane unpacking. The cytotoxic product(s) was present in cell-free culture supernatant and whole-cell preparations of H. ducreyi and was heat labile. H. ducreyi produces two known heat-labile toxins, a hemolysin and a cytolethal distending toxin (CDT). Whole cells and supernatants prepared from a hemolysin-deficient mutant had the same inhibitory and apoptotic effects on Jurkat T cells as did its isogenic parent. Preparations made from an H. ducreyi cdtC mutant were less toxic and induced less apoptosis than the parent. The toxic activity of the cdtC mutant was restored by complementation in trans. CdtC-neutralizing antibodies also inhibited H. ducreyi-induced toxicity and apoptosis. The data suggest that CDT may interfere with T-cell responses to H. ducreyi by induction of apoptosis.",M2
10496878,"Identification of the znuA-encoded periplasmic zinc transport protein of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.The znuA gene of Haemophilus ducreyi encodes a 32-kDa (mature) protein that has homology to both the ZnuA protein of Escherichia coli and the Pzp1 protein of H. influenzae; both of these latter proteins are members of a growing family of prokaryotic zinc transporters. Inactivation of the H. ducreyi 35000 znuA gene by insertional mutagenesis resulted in a mutant that grew more slowly than the wild-type parent strain in vitro unless ZnCl(2) was provided at a final concentration of 100 microM. Other cations tested did not restore growth of this H. ducreyi mutant to wild-type levels. The H. ducreyi ZnuA protein was localized to the periplasm, where it is believed to function as the binding component of a zinc transport system. Complementation of the znuA mutation with the wild-type H. ducreyi znuA gene provided in trans restored the ability of this H. ducreyi mutant to grow normally in the absence of exogenously added ZnCl2. The wild-type H. ducreyi znuA gene was also able to complement a H. influenzae pzp1 mutation. The H. ducreyi znuA isogenic mutant exhibited significantly decreased virulence (P = 0.0001) when tested in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for experimental chancroid. This decreased virulence was not observed when the znuA mutant was complemented with the wild-type H. ducreyi znuA gene provided in trans.",M2
10441398,"Design of a  microbicide  for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases using  inactive  pharmaceutical excipients.The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) pandemic has been driven primarily by the sexual transmission of the virus, and facilitated by prior infections with other sexually transmitted disease (STD) pathogens. Although treatment of these STDs has been proposed as a means to decrease the rate of HIV-1 sexual transmission, preventive measures effective against both HIV-1 and other STD pathogens are expected to have a larger impact. These measures include topically applied mechanical and chemical (i.e. microbicidal) barriers. Microbicides of preference should have a broad specificity against diverse STD pathogens and a well established safety record, considering their repeated use over decades. Here, we report that cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), an  inactive  pharmaceutical excipient, commonly used in the production of enteric tablets and capsules: (1) has antiviral activity against HIV-1 and several herpesviruses (HSV); and (2) when appropriately formulated, in micronized form, inactivates HIV-1, HSV-1, HSV-2, cytomegalovirus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> and Chlamydia trachomatis but does not affect Lactobacilli, components of the natural vaginal flora contributing to resistance against STDs.

10417154,"Characterization of a <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> mutant deficient in expression of cytolethal distending toxin.Haemophilus ducreyi expresses a soluble cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) that kills HeLa, HEp-2, and other human epithelial cells in vitro. H. ducreyi CDT activity is encoded by a three-gene cluster (cdtABC), and antibody to the cdtC gene product can neutralize CDT activity in vitro (L. D. Cope, S. R. Lumbley, J. L. Latimer, J. Klesney-Tait, M. K. Stevens, L. S. Johnson, M. Purven, R. S. Munson, Jr., T. Lagergard, J. D. Radolf, and E. J. Hansen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:4056-4061, 1997). Culture supernatant fluid from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain containing the H. ducreyi cdtABC gene cluster readily killed both HeLa cells and HaCaT keratinocytes and had a modest inhibitory effect on the growth of human foreskin fibroblasts. Insertional inactivation of the cdtC gene in this recombinant E. coli strain eliminated the ability of this strain to kill HeLa cells and HaCaT keratinocytes. This mutated H. ducreyi cdtABC gene cluster was used to construct an isogenic H. ducreyi cdtC mutant. Monoclonal antibodies against the H. ducreyi CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC proteins were used to characterize protein expression by this cdtC mutant. Culture supernatant fluid from this H. ducreyi cdtC mutant did not detectably affect any of the human cells used in this study. The presence of the wild-type H. ducreyi cdtC gene in trans in this H. ducreyi mutant restored its ability to express a CDT that killed both HeLa cells and HaCaT keratinocytes. The isogenic H. ducreyi cdtC mutant was shown to be as virulent as its wild-type parent strain in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for experimental chancroid. Lack of expression of the H. ducreyi CdtC protein also did not affect the ability of this H. ducreyi mutant to survive in the skin of rabbits.",M2
10375627,"The dnaK/dnaJ operon of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> contains a unique combination of regulatory elements.Haemophilus ducreyi, which causes the genital ulcer disease chancroid, requires high basal levels of the 60-kDa heat-shock (hs) protein GroEL in order to survive and adhere to host cells in the presence of common environmental stresses. In contrast, the 70-kDa hs protein, DnaK, a negative modulator of the hs response in prokaryotes, is not produced at as high a level as GroEL. Because of these differences, we were interested in identifying regulatory elements affecting the expression of the H. ducreyi dnaK/dnaJ operon. First, the genes encoding H. ducreyi DnaK (Hsp70) and DnaJ (Hsp40) were sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences shared 82.8 and 63. 9% identity with the Escherichia coli DnaK and DnaJ homologs, respectively. Despite the presence of highly similar (but not identical) hs promoter sequences preceding both the H. ducreyi groES/groEL and dnaK/dnaJ operons, transcription levels for groEL were found to exceed that of dnaK. Subsequently, other genetic elements that could contribute to a lower basal expression of dnaK in H. ducreyi were identified. These elements include: (1) a complex promoter for dnaK consisting of four transcriptional start points (two for sigma32 and two for sigma70) identified by primer extension; (2) a putative binding site for Fur (a transcriptional repressor of iron-regulated genes) that overlaps the initiating AUG of dnaK; and (3) the potential for extensive secondary structure of the long leader sequences of the dnaK transcripts, which could interfere with efficient translation of DnaK. This unique combination of regulatory elements may be responsible for the relatively low-level expression of dnaK in this fastidious genital pathogen.",M2
10320348,"Investigation of the kinetic mechanism of cytidine 5'-monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase from <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> with new insights on rate-limiting steps from product inhibition analysis.The presence of sialic acid as a component of cell surface lipooligosaccharides or capsular polysaccharides has been shown to be correlated with the virulence of a number of Gram-negative mucosal pathogens, including several Haemophilus and Neisseria spp. As part of our efforts to evaluate the role of sialic acid in the pathobiology of these organisms, we have initiated studies of the enzymes from Haemophilus ducreyi (the infectious agent of chancroid) responsible for the activation and attachment of sialic acid to the lipooligosaccharide. In this report, we describe results of an investigation of the steady-state kinetic mechanism of the activating enzyme, cytidine 5'-monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) synthetase. Using a combination of initial velocity, product inhibition, and dead-end inhibition studies, the reaction is shown to be freely reversible and to proceed through an ordered bi-bi kinetic mechanism in which CTP binds first and CMP-NeuAc dissociates last. In addition, a detailed analysis of the kinetic expressions for the observable constants is presented showing how the variation in apparent product inhibition constants (Kii) can be used to predict the rate-limiting step in kcat, which appears to be dissociation of CMP-NeuAc in this enzyme. To our knowledge, this relationship has not been previously recognized.",M2

H. ducreyi 35000HP bound to fibronectin, laminin, and type I and III collagen but not to type IV, V, or VI collagen or elastin. Isogenic strains with mutations in ftpA or losB bound as well as the parent, suggesting that neither pili nor full-length lipooligosaccharide is required for H. ducreyi to bind to ECM proteins.",M2
9933604,"<e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> produces a novel sialyltransferase. Identification of the sialyltransferase gene and construction of mutants deficient in the production of the sialic acid-containing glycoform of the lipooligosaccharide.Haemophilus ducreyi, the cause of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid produces a lipooligosaccharide (LOS) containing a terminal sialyl N-acetyllactosamine trisaccharide. Previously, we reported the identification and characterization of the N-acetylneuraminic acid cytidylsynthetase gene (neuA). Forty-nine base pairs downstream of the synthetase gene is an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 34,646. This protein has weak homology to the polysialyltransferase of Escherichia coli K92. Downstream of this ORF is the gene encoding the H. ducreyi homologue of the Salmonella typhimurium rmlB gene. Mutations were constructed in the neuA gene and the gene encoding the second ORF by insertion of an Omega kanamycin cassette, and isogenic strains were constructed. LOS was isolated from each strain and characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, carbohydrate, and mass spectrometric analysis. LOS isolated from strains containing a mutation in neuA or in the second ORF, designated lst, lacked the sialic acid-containing glycoform. Complementation studies were performed. The neuA gene and the lst gene were each cloned into the shuttle vector pLS88 after polymerase chain reaction amplification. Complementation of the mutation in the lst gene was observed, but we were unable to complement the neuA mutation. Since it is possible that transcription of the neuA gene and the lst gene were coupled, we constructed a nonpolar mutation in the neuA gene. In this construct, the neuA mutation was complemented, suggesting transcriptional coupling of the neuA gene and the lst gene. Sialyltransferase activity was detected by incorporation of 14C-labeled NeuAc from CMP-NeuAc into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material when the lst gene was overexpressed in the nonpolar neuA mutant. We conclude that the lst gene encodes the H. ducreyi sialyltransferase. Since the lst gene product has little, if any, structural relationship to other sialyltransferases, this protein represents a new class of sialyltransferase.",M2

Campagnari, L. M. Wild, G. Griffiths, R. J. Karalus, M. A. Wirth, and S. M. Spinola, Infect. Immun. 59:2601-2608, 1991) and likely contributes to the virulence of this sexually transmitted pathogen (B. A. Bauer, M. K. Stevens, and E. J. Hansen, Infect. Immun. 68:4290-4298, 1998). An open reading frame in H. ducreyi 35000 was found to encode a predicted protein that was 59% identical to the protein product of the rfaF (waaF) gene of Salmonella typhimurium. The H. ducreyi waaF gene was able to complement an S. typhimurium rfaF (waaF) mutant, a result which confirmed the identity of this gene. In contrast to the rfaF (waaF) gene of enteric bacteria, the H. ducreyi waaF gene was not located adjacent to other genes involved in lipopolysaccharide expression. Inactivation of the H. ducreyi waaF gene by insertion mutagenesis resulted in expression of a LOS that migrated much faster than wild-type LOS in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The LOS of this mutant also did not bind a monoclonal antibody directed against a cell surface-exposed epitope of wild-type H. ducreyi LOS. Testing of the wild-type H. ducreyi strain and its isogenic waaF mutant in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for dermal lesion production by H. ducreyi revealed that this waaF mutant was less virulent than the wild-type parent strain. Complementation of the H. ducreyi waaF mutant with the wild-type H. ducreyi waaF gene resulted in expression of both wild-type LOS and wild-type virulence by this mutant.",M2
9488422,"GroEL heat shock protein of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>: association with cell surface and capacity to bind to eukaryotic cells.The Haemophilus ducreyi homolog of GroEL, a 58.5-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp), is a dominant protein produced not only in response to heat stress but also under in vitro growth conditions. Extracellular localization of the 58.5-kDa Hsp was investigated by whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoelectron microscopy and in supernatants of washed bacteria by immunoblotting with a Haemophilus ducreyi GroEL-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (BB11). To investigate binding of the Hsp to eukaryotic cells, the 58.5-kDa Hsp was purified by ion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography; incubated with HEp-2 cells, HeLa cells, and human fibroblasts; and then analyzed by immunoblotting. Direct involvement of the 58.5-kDa Hsp in the adherence of H. ducreyi to HEp-2 cells was investigated by using an inhibition assay. An epitope of the 58.5-kDa Hsp was detected by whole-cell ELISA on all of the strains tested, suggesting that it is associated with the cell surface. This was also supported by immunoelectron microscopy results. In supernatants of washed bacteria, the 58.5-kDa Hsp was detected by immunoblotting after 10 h of cultivation. The 58.5-kDa Hsp bound to the eukaryotic cells tested but exerted only limited (about 20%) inhibition of H. ducreyi adherence to HEp-2 cells. These results demonstrate that the 58.5-kDa Hsp of H. ducreyi is associated with the bacterial surface, binds to eukaryotic cells, and partially influences H. ducreyi adherence to HEp-2 cells, indicating possible involvement of the 58.5-kDa Hsp in the attachment of bacteria to host cells and to each other.",M2
9484894,"Periplasmic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase protects <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> from exogenous superoxide.Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid, a sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease implicated in increased heterosexual transmission of HIV. As part of an effort to identify H. ducreyi gene products involved in virulence and pathogenesis, we created random TnphoA insertion mutations in an H. ducreyi 35000 library cloned in Escherichia coli. Inserts encoding exported or secreted PhoA fusion proteins were characterized by DNA sequencing. One such clone encoded a Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme. The Cu-Zn SOD was periplasmic in H. ducreyi and accounted for most of the detectable SOD activity in whole-cell lysates of H. ducreyi grown in vitro. To investigate the function of the Cu-Zn SOD, we created a Cu-Zn SOD-deficient H. ducreyi strain by inserting a cat cassette into the sodC gene. The wild-type and Cu-Zn SOD null mutant strains were equally resistant to excess cytoplasmic superoxide induced by paraquat, demonstrating that the Cu-Zn SOD did not function in the detoxification of cytoplasmic superoxide. However, the Cu-Zn SOD null strain was significantly more susceptible to killing by extracellular superoxide than the wild type. This result suggests that the H. ducreyi Cu-Zn SOD may play a role in bacterial defence against oxidative killing by host immune cells during infection.",M2

The Genital Ulcer Disease Surveillance Group.To determine the etiology of genital ulcers and to assess the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in ulcer patients in 10 US cities, ulcer and serum specimens were collected from approximately 50 ulcer patients at a sexually transmitted disease clinic in each city. Ulcer specimens were tested using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay to detect <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>, Treponema pallidum, and herpes simplex virus (HSV); sera were tested for antibody to HIV. H. ducreyi was detected in ulcer specimens from patients in Memphis (20% of specimens) and Chicago (12%). T. pallidum was detected in ulcer specimens from every city except Los Angeles (median, 9% of specimens; range, 0%-46%). HSV was detected in &gt;/=50% of specimens from all cities except Memphis (42%). HIV seroprevalence in ulcer patients was 6% (range by city, 0%-18%). These data suggest that chancroid is prevalent in some US cities and that persons with genital ulcers should be a focus of HIV prevention activities.",M2
9811662,"<e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> secretes a filamentous hemagglutinin-like protein.We have identified two extremely large open reading frames (ORFs) in Haemophilus ducreyi 35000, lspA1 and lspA2, each of which encodes a predicted protein product whose N-terminal half is approximately 43% similar to the N-terminal half of Bordetella pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin (FhaB). To the best of our knowledge, lspA1 (12,500 nucleotides [nt]) and lspA2 (14,800 nt) are among the largest prokaryotic ORFs identified to date. The predicted proteins, LspA1 and LspA2, are 86% identical overall to each other and also have limited amino acid sequence similarity at their N termini to other secreted bacterial proteins, including certain hemolysins. Southern blot analysis indicated that lspA1 and lspA2 sequences were present in 15 other geographically diverse H. ducreyi strains. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from H. ducreyi 35000 grown in liquid medium, grown on solid agar medium, and isolated from lesions of H. ducreyi-infected rabbits indicated that lspA1 and lspA2 were transcribed both in vitro and in vivo. A 260-kDa protein present in culture supernatant from eight virulent H. ducreyi strains reacted with both polyclonal serum from rabbits infected with H. ducreyi 35000 and a monoclonal antibody predicted to bind both LspA1 and LspA2. This 260-kDa protein in H. ducreyi 35000 culture supernatant was shown to be the protein product of the lspA1 ORF based on its reactivity with a monoclonal antibody specific for LspA1. Four H. ducreyi strains, previously shown to be avirulent in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for chancroid, did not produce either LspA1 or LspA2 in vitro. This finding raised the possibility that LspA1, LspA2, or both may be involved in the ability of H. ducreyi to cause lesions in this animal model.",M2
9756778,"<e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> is susceptible to protegrin.Protegrins, potent antimicrobial peptides found in porcine leukocytes, have activity against the sexually transmitted pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. We tested synthetic protegrin 1 (PG-1) for activity against nine isolates of Haemophilus ducreyi, the etiologic agent of chancroid. The test organisms included CIP 542 (the type strain), 35000HP (a human-passaged variant of 35000), 35000HP-RSM2 (an isogenic D-glycero-D-manno-heptosyltransferase mutant of 35000HP), and six clinical isolates. The isolates were epidemiologically unrelated, represented three HindIII ribotypes, and had varying antimicrobial resistance patterns. In bactericidal assays, five isolates were rapidly killed by synthetic PG-1. In radial diffusion assays, all nine isolates were exquisitely sensitive to PG-1. These data highlight the potential of protegrins for development as topical agents to prevent many sexually transmitted diseases, including chancroid.",M2
9712775,"Cloning and characterization of tdhA, a locus encoding a TonB-dependent heme receptor from <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e>.Haemophilus ducreyi is unable to synthesize heme and must acquire it from its only known host, humans. We cloned and sequenced a gene encoding an outer membrane receptor for heme. It was designated tdhA (for TonB-dependent heme receptor A) since it was related by sequence homology to the family of TonB-dependent receptors. TdhA was strikingly similar to open reading frame HI0113 from the genome of Haemophilus influenzae Rd and also shared homology with five other heme receptors, including HxuC, HemR, HmuR, ChuA, and ShuA, from gram-negative bacteria. An Escherichia coli hemA tonB mutant strongly expressing H. ducreyi tdhA grew on low levels of heme as a source of heme only when an intact H. ducreyi Ton system plasmid was present, formally demonstrating functional TonB dependence. tdhA was expressed poorly in vitro by H. ducreyi and only under conditions of heme limitation. A survey of H. ducreyi revealed that all tested strains but one synthesized small amounts of TdhA in vitro under heme-limiting conditions. Surprisingly, an isogenic mutant of tdhA as well as its parent, 35000, both required the same high levels of heme for growth (50 microgram/ml [77 microM] on agar medium). This result, together with previous findings, suggests that in vitro, the uptake of heme by H. ducreyi is mediated by a TonB- and TdhA-independent mechanism, possibly diffusion.",M2
9682476,"Facile construction of mutations in <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> using lacZ as a counter-selectable marker.Haemophilus ducreyi is a Gram-negative bacterium which is the causative agent of chancroid, an ulcerative sexually transmitted disease. In order to understand the pathogenesis of H. ducreyi disease, studies designed to identify potential virulence determinants and construct mutants deficient in the elaboration of these determinants have been undertaken in several laboratories. At the present time, construction of isogenic mutants is accomplished by electroporation of linearized DNA containing insertionally inactivated H. ducreyi genes followed by selection for the resistance marker encoded on the inactivated gene. In our experience, certain mutants are difficult to construct using this procedure. In the construction of strains containing lacZ as a reporter gene, we observed that the growth of lacZ expressing H. ducreyi was inhibited in the presence of X-gal. We have exploited this observation to develop a new strategy for the construction of isogenic H. ducreyi mutants.",M2
9674891,"Characterization of mechanisms involved in adherence of <e>Haemophilus ducreyi</e> to eukaryotic cells.The adherence of Haemophilus ducreyi to eukaryotic cells of various origins was investigated by means of a microassay using radiolabelled bacteria. The influence of physicochemical conditions and of different inhibitors on adherence to HEp-2 cells and human fibroblasts was examined. H. ducreyi strains manifested substantial adherence capacity (range, 11-38% of inoculum) to different cells, not discriminating between human and animal origin. The level of adherence was temperature-dependent, being substantially decreased by incubation at 4 degrees C, but was unaffected in the pH range 4-10. The adherence level was significantly reduced in the presence of sodium chloride or tetramethylurea (a hydrophobic bond-breaking agent). In addition, H. ducreyi bacteria manifested a pronounced capacity for binding Congo red to the surface, in comparison with the low binding ability of H. influenzae type b. This further indicates hydrophobic domains to be accessible on the surface of H. ducreyi. Inhibition studies with bacterial EDTA extract, sialic acid, heparin and heparan sulphate resulted in a significant reduction in adherent bacteria. However, adherence was not inhibited with crude 24 kDa pili material, LOS of H. ducreyi or fibronectin. Neither crude nor purified 24 kDa protein of H. ducreyi bacteria showed any capacity to bind monolayers of HEp-2, HeLa or human fibroblasts cells, as tested by immunoblot using specific polyclonal antibodies. The overall results suggest that adherence of H. ducreyi to eukaryotic cells is not specific to a particular cell type, human or animal. Adherence to HEp-2 cells involves a multiplicity of factors such as ionic and hydrophobic forces, and can be mediated by tissue heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans. However, specific binding to HEp-2 cells does not seem to be mediated by the 24 kDa pili protein of H. ducreyi.",M2

The sodA gene of Haemophilus ducreyi was isolated from a genomic plasmid library on the basis of its ability to rescue the hydrogen peroxide hypersensitivity of an Escherichia coli sodA sodB strain. The H. ducreyi SodA protein also complemented the aerobic growth defect of the E. coli sodA sodB strain in minimal medium. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the H. ducreyi sodA gene product is 74 and 70% identical to the Mn-SODs of Haemophilus influenzae and E. coli, respectively. However, unlike Mn-SODs, the H ducreyi SodA protein was inhibited by hydrogen peroxide in native gels stained for SOD activity.",M2
