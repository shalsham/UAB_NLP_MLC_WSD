20384814,"Functional deprivation promotes amyloid <e>plaque</e> pathogenesis in Tg2576 mouse olfactory bulb and piriform cortex.Cerebral hypometabolism and amyloid accumulation are principal neuropathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether and how brain/neuronal activity might modulate certain pathological processes of AD are interesting topics of recent clinical and basic research in the field, and may be of potential medical relevance in regard to both the disease etiology and intervention. Using the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of AD, this study characterized a promotive effect of neuronal hypoactivity associated with functional deprivation on amyloid plaque pathogenesis in the olfactory pathway. Unilateral naris-occlusion caused beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) elevation in neuronal terminals in the deprived relative to the non-deprived bulb and piriform cortex in young adult mice. In parallel with the overall age-related plaque development in the forebrain, locally increased BACE1 immunoreactivity co-occurred with amyloid deposition first in the piriform cortex then within the bulb, more prominent on the deprived relative to the non-deprived side. Biochemical analyses confirmed elevated BACE1 protein levels, enzymatic activity and products in the deprived relative to non-deprived bulbs. Plaque-associated BACE1 immunoreactivity in the bulb and piriform cortex was localized preferentially to swollen/sprouting glutamatergic axonal terminals, with Abeta immunoreactivity occurring inside as well as around these terminals. Together, these findings suggest that functional deprivation or neuronal hypoactivity facilitates amyloid plaque formation in the forebrain in a transgenic model of AD, which operates synergistically with age effect. The data also implicate an intrinsic association of amyloid accumulation and plaque formation with progressive axonal pathology.",M1
20371510,"Relationships between age and late progression of Parkinson's disease: a clinico-pathological study.To investigate the relationships between age, the advanced clinical stages of Parkinson's disease and neuropathology, we surveyed 129 case records from donors with pathologically proven Parkinson's disease at the Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders. Cases were separated into five groups according to age at death, thus comparing patients who reached the advanced stage of the disease at different ages. Four milestones of advanced disease (frequent falls, visual hallucinations, dementia and need for residential care) occurred at a similar time from death in each group. There were no significant differences in disease duration across these age groupings, nor were there differences in the severity and distribution of Lewy body and other pathologies. The milestones of dementia (P &lt; 0.0005) and visual hallucinations (P = 0.02) as well as the accumulation of multiple milestones (P &lt; 0.0005) were associated with high cortical Lewy body scores. Demented cases also had significantly more Alzheimer neurofibrillary and amyloid-beta <e>plaque</e> pathology. Correlation analysis showed that the time intervals between disease onset and recording of milestones were strongly influenced by age at onset (P &lt; 0.0001) and by total disease duration (P &lt; 0.0001). The advanced disease phase plays out in a similar fashion at whatever age it occurs, with a common pathological endpoint. The clinico-pathological comparisons for the final stage of Parkinson's disease do support a staging system based on the rostral extent and severity of Lewy body pathology, although other pathologies may play a synergistic role in causing cognitive disability. The chief effects of age on the rate of progression are seen over the early-middle part of the disease. An exponential curve for clinical progression provides the best explanation for these observations about age and the disease course.",M1
20368278,"IFN-gamma promotes complement expression and attenuates amyloid <e>plaque</e> deposition in amyloid beta precursor protein transgenic mice.Reactive gliosis surrounding amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques is an early feature of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and has been postulated to represent activation of the innate immune system in an apparently ineffective attempt to clear or neutralize Abeta aggregates. To evaluate the role of IFN-gamma-mediated neuroinflammation on the evolution of Abeta pathology in transgenic (Tg) mice, we have expressed murine IFN-gamma (mIFN-gamma) in the brains of Abeta precursor protein (APP) Tg mice using recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 1. Expression of mIFN-gamma in brains of APP TgCRND8 mice results in robust noncell autonomous activation of microglia and astrocytes, and a concomitant significant suppression of Abeta deposition. In these mice, mIFN-gamma expression upregulated multiple glial activation markers, early components of the complement cascade as well as led to infiltration of Ly-6c positive peripheral monocytes but no significant effects on APP levels, APP processing or steady-state Abeta levels were noticed in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that mIFN-gamma expression in the brain suppresses Abeta accumulation through synergistic effects of activated glia and components of the innate immune system that enhance Abeta aggregate phagocytosis.",M1
20360050,"Beneficial effect of human anti-amyloid-beta active immunization on neurite morphology and tau pathology.Anti-amyloid-beta immunization leads to amyloid clearance in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but the effect of vaccination on amyloid-beta-induced neuronal pathology has not been quantitatively examined. The objectives of this study were to address the effects of anti-amyloid-beta active immunization on neurite trajectories and the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease in the human hippocampus. Hippocampal sections from five patients with Alzheimer's disease enrolled in the AN1792 Phase 2a trial were compared with those from 13 non-immunized Braak-stage and age-matched patients with Alzheimer's disease, and eight age-matched non-demented controls. Analyses included neurite curvature ratio as a quantitative measure of neuritic abnormalities, amyloid and tau loads, and a quantitative characterization of <e>plaque</e>-associated neuritic dystrophy and astrocytosis. Amyloid load and density of dense-core plaques were decreased in the immunized group compared to non-immunized patients (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). The curvature ratio in non-immunized patients with Alzheimer's disease was elevated compared to non-demented controls (P &lt; 0.0001). In immunized patients, however, the curvature ratio was normalized when compared to non-immunized patients (P &lt; 0.0001), and not different from non-demented controls. In the non-immunized patients, neurites close to dense-core plaques (within 50 microm) were more abnormal than those far from plaques (i.e. beyond 50 microm) (P &lt; 0.0001). By contrast, in the immunized group neurites close to and far from the remaining dense-core plaques did not differ, and both were straighter compared to the non-immunized patients (P &lt; 0.0001). Compared to non-immunized patients, dense-core plaques remaining after immunization had similar degree of astrocytosis (P = 0.6060), more embedded dystrophic neurites (P &lt; 0.0001) and were more likely to have mitochondrial accumulation (P &lt; 0.001). In addition, there was a significant decrease in the density of paired helical filament-1-positive neurons in the immunized group as compared to the non-immunized (P &lt; 0.05), but not in the density of Alz50 or thioflavin-S positive tangles, suggesting a modest effect of anti-amyloid-beta immunization on tangle pathology. Clearance of amyloid plaques upon immunization with AN1792 effectively improves a morphological measure of neurite abnormality in the hippocampus. This improvement is not just attributable to the decrease in plaque load, but also occurs within the halo of the remaining dense-core plaques. However, these remaining plaques still retain some of their toxic potential. Anti-amyloid-beta immunization might also ameliorate the hippocampal tau pathology through a decrease in tau phosphorylation. These data agree with preclinical animal studies and further demonstrate that human anti-amyloid-beta immunization does not merely clear amyloid from the Alzheimer's disease brain, but reduces some of the neuronal alterations that characterize Alzheimer's disease.",M1
20205640,"Amyloid-beta immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, degenerative disorder of the brain and the most common form of dementia among the elderly. As the population grows and lifespan is extended, the number of AD patients will continue to rise. Current clinical therapies for AD provide partial symptomatic benefits for some patients; however, none of them modify disease progression. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, the major component of senile <e>plaques</e> in AD patients, is considered to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD thereby leading to Abeta as a target for treatment. Abeta immunotherapy has been shown to induce a marked reduction in amyloid burden and an improvement in cognitive function in animal models. Although preclinical studies were successful, the initial human clinical trial of an active Abeta vaccine was halted due to the development of meningoencephalitis in approximately 6% of the vaccinated AD patients. Some encouraging outcomes, including signs of cognitive stabilization and apparent plaque clearance, were obtained in subset of patients who generated antibody titers. These promising preliminary data support further efforts to refine Abeta immunotherapy to produce highly effective and safer active and passive vaccines for AD. Furthermore, some new human clinical trials for both active and passive Abeta immunotherapy are underway. In this review, we will provide an update of Abeta immunotherapy in animal models and in human beings, as well as discuss the possible mechanisms underlying Abeta immunotherapy for AD.",M1
20180882,"Abnormal post-translational and extracellular processing of brevican in <e>plaque</e>-bearing mice over-expressing APPsw.Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the forebrain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects may disturb the molecular organization of the extracellular microenvironment that modulates neural and synaptic plasticity. Proteoglycans are major components of this extracellular environment. To test the hypothesis that Abeta, or another amyloid precursor protein (APP) dependent mechanism modifies the accumulation and/or turnover of extracellular proteoglycans, we examined whether the expression and processing of brevican, an abundant extracellular, chondroitin sulfate (CS)-bearing proteoglycan, were altered in brains of Abeta-depositing transgenic mice (APPsw - APP gene bearing the Swedish mutation) as a model of AD. The molecular size of CS chains attached to brevican was smaller in hippocampal tissue from APPsw mice bearing Abeta deposits compared to non-transgenic mice, likely because of changes in the CS chains. Also, the abundance of the major proteolytic fragment of brevican was markedly diminished in extracts from several telencephalic regions of APPsw mice compared to non-transgenic mice, yet these immunoreactive fragments appeared to accumulate adjacent to the plaque edge. These results suggest that Abeta or APP exert inhibitory effects on proteolytic cleavage mechanisms responsible for synthesis and turnover of proteoglycans. As proteoglycans stabilize synaptic structure and inhibit molecular plasticity, defective brevican processing observed in Abeta-bearing mice and potentially end-stage human AD, may contribute to deficient neural plasticity.",M1
20153809,"Amyloid load in nondemented brains correlates with APOE e4.179 Cognitively healthy adults enrolled in the Sun Health Brain Donation program between 7/91 and 12/07 were at least 60 years old and nondemented at the time of death (21 had developed mild cognitive impairment [MCI]). Amyloid <e>plaque</e> density, congophilic amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) density scores were based on CERAD criteria and compared in apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 carriers (n=42) and noncarriers (NC) (n=137). Mean age (83.4+/-.6), gender (45% women), interval between death and brain harvest (3.1+/-2.4h), and brain weight (1200+/-119 g) did not differ between e4 carriers (n=42) and NC. Total plaque density was higher in e4 carriers than NC (6.8+/-4.9 vs. 4.3+/-4.4, p=.002), and this was true in each of 5 subregions examined. Total CAA (p=.002) and all subregion CAA burden was also higher in e4 carriers. Total neuritic plaque density (1.2+/-1.0 vs. 1.0+/-1.0, p=.18) and total NFT density (3.9+/-2.4 vs. 3.6+/-2.3, p=.50) did not differ between e4 carriers and NC, nor in any subregion. Eliminating the 21 with MCI did not alter these results. Nondemented APOE e4 carriers over age 60 have a higher burden of total parenchymal and vascular amyloid neuropathology than NC, but no difference in neuritic plaque and NFT pathology.",M1
20133839,"Mechanism of amyloid <e>plaque</e> formation suggests an intracellular basis of Abeta pathogenicity.The formation of extracellular amyloid plaques is a common patho-biochemical event underlying several debilitating human conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considerable evidence implies that AD damage arises primarily from small oligomeric amyloid forms of Abeta peptide, but the precise mechanism of pathogenicity remains to be established. Using a cell culture system that reproducibly leads to the formation of Alzheimer's Abeta amyloid plaques, we show here that the formation of a single amyloid plaque represents a template-dependent process that critically involves the presence of endocytosis- or phagocytosis-competent cells. Internalized Abeta peptide becomes sorted to multivesicular bodies where fibrils grow out, thus penetrating the vesicular membrane. Upon plaque formation, cells undergo cell death and intracellular amyloid structures become released into the extracellular space. These data imply a mechanism where the pathogenic activity of Abeta is attributed, at least in part, to intracellular aggregates.",M1
20101720,"Neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease.Alois Alzheimer first pointed out that the disease which would later bear his name has a distinct and recognizable neuropathological substrate. Since then, much has been added to our understanding of the pathological lesions associated with the condition. The 2 primary cardinal lesions associated with Alzheimer's disease are the neurofibrillary tangle and the senile <e>plaque</e>. The neurofibrillary tangle consists of abnormal accumulations of abnormally phosphorylated tau within the perikaryal cytoplasm of certain neurons. The senile plaque consists of a central core of beta-amyloid, a 4-kD peptide, surrounded by abnormally configured neuronal processes or neurites. Other neuropathological lesions are encountered in cases of Alzheimer's disease, but the disease is defined and recognized by these 2 cardinal lesions. Other lesions include poorly understood changes such as granulovacuolar degeneration and eosinophilic rodlike bodies (Hirano bodies). The loss of synaptic components is a change that clearly has a significant impact on cognitive function and represents another important morphological alteration. It is important to recognize that distinguishing between Alzheimer's disease, especially in its early stages, and normal aging may be very difficult, particularly if one is examining the brains of patients who died at an advanced old age. It is also noted that instances of pure forms of Alzheimer's disease, in the absence of other coexistent brain disease processes, such as infarctions or Parkinson's disease-related lesions, are relatively uncommon, and this must be taken into account by researchers who employ postmortem brain tissues for research.",M1
20092570,"Beta-secretase-1 elevation in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease is associated with synaptic/axonal pathology and amyloidogenesis: implications for neuritic <e>plaque</e> development.The presence of neuritic plaques is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the origin of extracellular beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) deposits and the process of plaque development remain poorly understood. The present study attempted to explore plaque pathogenesis by localizing beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) elevation relative to Abeta accumulation and synaptic/neuritic alterations in the forebrain, using transgenic mice harboring familial AD (FAD) mutations (5XFAD and 2XFAD) as models. In animals with fully developed plaque pathology, locally elevated BACE1 immunoreactivity (IR) coexisted with compact-like Abeta deposition, with BACE1 IR occurring selectively in dystrophic axons of various neuronal phenotypes or origins (GABAergic, glutamatergic, cholinergic or catecholaminergic). Prior to plaque onset, localized BACE1/Abeta IR occurred at swollen presynaptic terminals and fine axonal processes. These BACE1/Abeta-containing axonal elements appeared to undergo a continuing process of sprouting/swelling and dystrophy, during which extracellular Abeta IR emerged and accumulated in surrounding extracellular space. These data suggest that BACE1 elevation and associated Abeta overproduction inside the sprouting/dystrophic axonal terminals coincide with the onset and accumulation of extracellular amyloid deposition during the development of neuritic plaques in transgenic models of AD. Our findings appear to be in harmony with an early hypothesis that axonal pathogenesis plays a key or leading role in plaque formation.",M1
20091183,"APP transgenic modeling of Alzheimer's disease: mechanisms of neurodegeneration and aberrant neurogenesis.Neurodegenerative disorders of the aging population affect over 5 million people in the US and Europe alone. The common feature is the progressive accumulation of misfolded proteins with the formation of toxic oligomers. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive impairment, progressive degeneration of neuronal populations in the neocortex and limbic system, and formation of amyloid <e>plaques</e> and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is the product of proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta and gamma-secretase enzymes. The neurodegenerative process in AD initiates with axonal and synaptic damage and is associated with progressive accumulation of toxic Abeta oligomers in the intracellular and extracellular space. In addition, neurodegeneration in AD is associated with alterations in neurogenesis. Abeta accumulation is the consequence of an altered balance between protein synthesis, aggregation rate, and clearance. Identification of genetic mutations in APP associated with familial forms of AD and gene polymorphisms associated with the more common sporadic variants of AD has led to the development of transgenic (tg) and knock out rodents as well as viral vector driven models of AD. While APP tg murine models with mutations in the N- and C-terminal flanking regions of Abeta are characterized by increased Abeta production with plaque formation, mutations in the mid-segment of Abeta result in increased formation of oligomers, and mutations toward the C-terminus (E22Q) segment results in amyloid angiopathy. Similar to AD, in APP tg models bearing familial mutations, formation of Abeta oligomers results in defective plasticity in the perforant pathway, selective neuronal degeneration, and alterations in neurogenesis. Promising results have been obtained utilizing APP tg models of AD to develop therapies including the use of beta- and gamma-secretase inhibitors, immunization, and stimulating neurogenesis.",M1
20089413,"Synthesis and evaluation of 18F-fluoroethylated benzothiazole derivatives for in vivo imaging of amyloid <e>plaques</e> in Alzheimer's disease.Amyloid aggregates play a major role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Targeting these aggregates by PET probes enables non-invasively the detection and quantification of amyloid deposit distribution in human brains. Based on benzothiazole core structure a series of amyloid imaging agents were developed. Currently [(11)C]2-(4'-(methylamino)phenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB) is the most specific and widely used amyloid imaging ligand. But due to the short half life of (11)C, longer lived (18)F-labeled derivatives offer logistic advantages and higher contrast images. In this work, three different [(18)F]fluoroethoxy-substituted benzothiazole derivatives ([(18)F]2-(4'-(methylamino)phenyl)-6-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzothiazole, [(18)F]2-((2'-(2-fluoroethoxy)-4'-amino)phenyl)benzothiazole and [(18)F]2-(3'-((2-fluoroethoxy)-4'-amino)phenyl)benzothiazole) were synthesized via [(18)F]fluoroethylation. The latter two derivatives with fluoroethoxy-substitution on the aromatic amino group showed very low binding affinity for amyloid aggregates. In contrast [(18)F]2-(4'-(methylamino)phenyl)-6-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzothiazole with [(18)F]fluoroethoxy-substitution in 6-position showed excellent amyloid imaging properties with respect to lipophilicity, brain entry and brain clearance in normal SCID mice, amyloid plaque binding affinity and specificity.",M1
20079340,"Increased expression of cholesterol transporter ABCA1 is highly correlated with severity of dementia in AD hippocampus.To gain insight into ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) function and its potential role in AD pathology, we analyzed the expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCA1 in postmortem hippocampus from persons at different stages of dementia and AD associated neuropathology relative to cognitively intact normal donors by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. In this study clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores were used as a measure of dementia severity, whereas, Braak neuropathological staging and neuritic <e>plaque</e> density were used as an index of the neuropathological progression of AD. Correlation analysis showed that ABCA1 mRNA expression was significantly elevated at the earliest recognizable stage of dementia compared to persons with intact cognition. ABCA1 mRNA was also positively correlated with Braak neuropathological stages and neuritic plaque density counts. Additionally, ABCA1 mRNA levels showed robust correlation with dementia severity even after controlling for the confounding contribution of accompanying neuropathological parameters to ABCA1 mRNA expression. Western blot analyses showed that the differential expression observed at the transcriptional level is also reflected at the protein level. Thus, our study provides transcriptional and translational evidence that the expression of ABCA1, a key modulator of cholesterol transport across the plasma membrane, is dysregulated in the AD brain and that this dysregulation is associated with increasing severity of AD, whether measured functionally as dementia severity or neuropathologically as increased neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle density.",M1
20061602,"Co-localization of Reelin and proteolytic AbetaPP fragments in hippocampal <e>plaques</e> in aged wild-type mice.Reelin is a large extracellular glycoprotein required for proper neuronal positioning during development. In the adult brain, Reelin plays a crucial modulatory role in the induction of synaptic plasticity and successful formation of long-term memory. Recently, alterations in Reelin-mediated signaling have been suggested to contribute to neuronal dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously reported that aging in several species is characterized by a decline in Reelin-expressing interneurons and concomitant accumulation in amyloid-like plaques in the hippocampal formation, significantly correlating with cognitive impairments. In transgenic AD mice, we detected Reelin in oligomeric amyloid-beta aggregates and in tight association with fibrillary plaques. Here, we used immunohistochemistry at the light and electron microscopy level to characterize further the morphology, temporal and spatial progression, as well as the potential of Reelin-positive plaques to sequester murine amyloid-beta peptides in wild-type mice. We developed a new immunohistochemical protocol involving a stringent protease pretreatment which markedly enhanced Reelin-immunoreactivity and allowed specific detection of variable shapes of murine anti-amyloid-beta protein precursor-immunoreactivity in plaques in the hippocampus, likely representing N-terminal fragments and amyloid-beta species. Ultrastructural investigations confirmed the presence of Reelin in extracellular space, somata of interneurons in young and aged wild-type mice. In aged mice, Reelin- and amyloid-beta-immunoreactivity was detected in extracellular, spherical deposits, likely representing small intermediates or fragments of amyloid fibrils. Our results suggest that Reelin itself aggregates into abnormal oligomeric or protofibrillary deposits during aging, potentially creating a precursor condition for fibrillary amyloid-beta plaque formation.",M1
20056779,"Oral treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor improves long-term potentiation in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.The beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is thought to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To study the effects of Abeta on the brain, transgenic mouse models have been developed that express high levels of Abeta. These mice show some features of AD, including amyloid <e>plaques</e> and mild cognitive impairment, but not others such as progressive neurodegeneration. We investigated the age-dependent effects of Abeta on synaptic physiology in Tg2576 mice that express human Abeta. We report that both basal synaptic activity and long-term potentiation (LTP), as measured in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, were compromised by 7 months of age before plaque deposition. Despite a persistent increase in Abeta levels with age, LTP recovered in 14-month-old mice, with no further loss of basal activity compared with activity measured in 7-month-old mice. Previous work has shown that inhibitors of gamma-secretase, an enzyme critical for Abeta synthesis, can significantly reduce Abeta production and plaque formation in Tg2576 mice. Our data demonstrate that 7-month-old Tg2576 mice treated with an orally available gamma-secretase inhibitor showed a significant improvement in synaptic function and plasticity within days, and the effect was correlated with the extent and duration of Abeta reduction. These results indicate that recovery from Abeta-mediated synaptotoxicity can occur rapidly with Abeta-lowering therapies. These findings highlight some of the strengths and limitations of using Abeta-overexpressing mouse models for Alzheimer's drug discovery.",M1
20016651,"Intravital imaging of amyloid <e>plaques</e> in a transgenic mouse model using optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy.We report optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) for in vivo imaging of amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Validation using conventional fluorescence microscopy and multiphoton microscopy shows that OR-PAM has sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution to identify amyloid plaques in living brains. In addition, with dual-wavelength OR-PAM, the three-dimensional morphology of amyloid plaques and the surrounding microvasculature are imaged simultaneously through a cranial window without angiographic contrast agents. OR-PAM, capable of providing both exogenous molecular contrast and endogenous hemoglobin contrast, has the potential to serve as a new technology for in vivo microscopic observations of cerebral plaque deposits.",M1
19944081,"Mice expressing the Swedish APP mutation on a 129 genetic background demonstrate consistent behavioral deficits and pathological markers of Alzheimer's disease.Mutant Tg2576 mice which possess the human  Swedish  APP mutation have been shown to demonstrate both Abeta <e>plaque</e> pathology and memory deficits in behavioral tasks. These mice are routinely maintained on a mixed C57BL/6xSJL genetic background which exhibits a high frequency of retinal degeneration allele and high variability in many behavioral assays. The same APP mutation is also available maintained on a 129 genetic background, providing more genetic homogeneity, but little data are published regarding the effects of the mutation on this background. We investigated whether transgenic mice expressing the Swedish mutation on the 129 background show similar behavioral deficits and Abeta pathology as those on the mixed background. Mice on the 129 background were tested at 6-7, 11-12, or 18-19 months of age in locomotor activity, Y-maze spontaneous alternation, and contextual fear conditioning. Differences were detected between WT and Tg mice in locomotor activity at 6-7 and 18-19 months, Y-maze at 6-7 and 11-12 months, and fear conditioning at 6-7, 11-12, and 18-19 months. In contrast, Tg mice on the mixed B6/SJL background tested at 6-7 months only demonstrated significant impairment in the contextual fear conditioning assay and in the Y-maze in one of 2 cohorts tested. Despite the behavioral differences observed, similar Abeta pathology was observed between Tg mice on the two genetic backgrounds. These results indicate that mice on the 129 genetic background may generate more consistent and robust behavioral differences, providing a useful model for testing therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease.",M1
19921519,"Presenilin transgenic mice as models of Alzheimer's disease.Mutations in presenilin-1 (PS1) and presenilin-2 (PS2) cause familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Presenilins influence multiple molecular pathways and are best known for their role in the gamma-secretase cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins including the amyloid precursor protein (APP). PS1 and PS2 FAD mutant transgenic mice have been generated using a variety of promoters. PS1-associated FAD mutations have also been knocked into the endogenous mouse gene. PS FAD mutant mice consistently show elevations of Abeta42 with little if any effect on Abeta40. When crossed with <e>plaque</e> forming APP FAD mutant lines, the PS1 FAD mutants cause earlier and more extensive plaque deposition. Although single transgenic PS1 or PS2 mice do not form plaques, they exhibit a number of pathological features including age-related neuronal and synaptic loss as well as vascular pathology. They also exhibit increased susceptibility to excitotoxic injury most likely on the basis of exaggerated calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Electrophysiologically long-term potentiation in the hippocampus is increased in young PS1 FAD mutant mice but this effect appears to be lost with aging. In most studies neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus is also impaired by PS1 FAD mutants. Mice in which PS1 has been conditionally knocked out in adult forebrain on a PS2 null background (PS1/2 cDKO) develop a striking neurodegeneration that mimics AD neuropathology in being associated with neuronal and synaptic loss, astrogliosis and hyperphosphorylation of tau, although it is not accompanied by plaque deposits. The relevance of PS transgenic mice as models of AD is discussed.",M1

Clinical and histopathological data were reviewed and immunohistochemical analysis was performed for S100, CD56, neuron-specific enolase, epithelial membrane antigen, CK7, CK8, CK14, and CK20. All cases showed similar morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics. Neural markers highlighted the biphasic pattern and CK7, CK8, and CK20 were detected on taste buds confined to the epithelium adjacent to the SNPs. Five patients presented pain/discomfort as the main symptom. Symptomatic SNPs seems to be more common than previously reported, presenting as focal burning on the posterolateral border of the tongue.",M1
19910533,"Amyloid seeds formed by cellular uptake, concentration, and aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide.One of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the amyloid <e>plaque</e>, primarily composed of aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. In vitro, Abeta(1-42), the major alloform of Abeta found in plaques, self-assembles into fibrils at micromolar concentrations and acidic pH. Such conditions do not exist in the extracellular fluid of the brain where the pH is neutral and Abeta concentrations are in the nanomolar range. Here, we show that extracellular soluble Abeta (sAbeta) at concentrations as low as 1 nM was taken up by murine cortical neurons and neuroblastoma (SHSY5Y) cells but not by human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Following uptake, Abeta accumulated in Lysotracker-positive acidic vesicles (likely late endosomes or lysosomes) where effective concentrations (&gt;2.5 microM) were greater than two orders of magnitude higher than that in the extracellular fluid (25 nM), as quantified by fluorescence intensity using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Furthermore, SHSY5Y cells incubated with 1 muM Abeta(1-42) for several days demonstrated a time-dependent increase in intracellular high molecular weight (HMW) (&gt;200 kDa) aggregates, which were absent in cells grown in the presence of Abeta(1-40). Homogenates from these Abeta(1-42)-loaded cells were capable of seeding amyloid fibril growth. These results demonstrate that Abeta can be taken up by certain cells at low physiologically relevant concentrations of extracellular Abeta, and then concentrated into endosomes/lysosomes. At high concentrations, vesicular Abeta aggregates to form HMW species which are capable of seeding amyloid fibril growth. We speculate that extrusion of these aggregates may seed extracellular amyloid plaque formation during AD pathogenesis.",M1
19906959,"Abeta immunotherapy protects morphology and survival of adult-born neurons in doubly transgenic APP/PS1 mice.The hippocampus is heavily affected by progressive neurodegeneration and beta-amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus is also one of the few brain regions that generate new neurons throughout adulthood. Because hippocampal neurogenesis is regulated by both endogenous and environmental factors, we determined whether it benefits from therapeutic reduction of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta)-related toxicity induced by passive Abeta immunotherapy. Abeta immunotherapy of 8-9-month-old mice expressing familial AD-causing mutations in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 genes with an antibody against Abeta decreased compact beta-amyloid <e>plaque</e> burden and promoted survival of newly born neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. As these neurons matured, they exhibited longer dendrites with more complex arborization compared with newly born neurons in control-treated transgenic littermates. The newly born neurons showed signs of functional integration indicated by expression of the immediate-early gene Zif268 in response to exposure to a novel object. Abeta immunotherapy was associated with higher numbers of synaptophysin-positive synaptic boutons. Labeling dividing progenitor cells with a retroviral vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed that Abeta immunotherapy restored the impaired dendritic branching, as well as the density of dendritic spines in new mature neurons. The presence of cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) on the dendrites of the GFP(+) newly born neurons is compatible with a putative role of PrP(c) in mediating Abeta-related toxicity in these cells. In addition, passive Abeta immunotherapy was accompanied by increased angiogenesis. Our data establish that passive Abeta immunotherapy can restore the morphological maturation of the newly formed neurons in the adult hippocampus and promote angiogenesis. These findings provide evidence for a role of Abeta immunotherapy in stimulating neurogenesis and angiogenesis in transgenic mouse models of AD, and they suggest the possibility that Abeta immunotherapy can recover neuronal and vascular functions in brains with beta-amyloidosis.",M1

Some studies report increases in plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, but there is no evidence for an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elderly schizophrenics. Models of a decreased cerebral reserve suggest that increases in AD-related neuropathology below the threshold for a neuropathological diagnosis could be related to dementia severity in elderly schizophrenia patients. We tested this hypothesis in 110 autopsy specimens of schizophrenia patients, without a neuropathological diagnosis of AD or other neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, we assessed the effects of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status, a known genetic risk factor for AD. Measures of density of neuritic plaques were obtained in five cortical regions, and the degree of hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles was rated. Dementia severity was measured prior to postmortem using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. multivariate analyses of variance were conducted with the factors dementia severity, by ApoE4 carrier status. Hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles correlated with increased dementia severity (p&lt;.05). Neuritic plaque density increased with greater dementia severity (p&lt;.005), and ApoE4 carrier status (p&lt;.005), and these differences were magnified by the ApoE4 carrier status (p&lt;.01). Even below the threshold for a neuropathological diagnosis of AD, neuritic plaques and hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles are associated with dementia severity in schizophrenia patients, even more so in the presence of genetic risk factors, suggesting that a decreased cerebral reserve in elderly schizophrenics may increase susceptibility for dementia.",M1
19874267,"A PPARdelta agonist reduces amyloid burden and brain inflammation in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.Agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) have been shown to reduce inflammatory responses in several animal models of neurological diseases and conditions and to reduce amyloid burden in transgenic mice expressing mutant forms of human amyloid precursor protein. However, the effects of activating the related receptor PPARdelta (PPARdelta), which is expressed at higher levels in the brain than PPARgamma, on inflammation and amyloid burden have not been explored. In this study we tested the effects of the selective PPARdelta agonist GW742 in 5xFAD mice which harbor 3 mutations in amyloid precursor protein and 2 mutations in presenilin 1, develop <e>plaques</e> by 5-6 weeks of age, and show robust inflammation and neuronal damage. Oral delivery of GW742 significantly reduced amyloid plaque burden in the subiculum region of 3-month old male and female 5xFAD mice. GW742 also significantly reduced astrocyte activation, suggesting anti-inflammatory effects on glia cells. The changes in plaque burden were accompanied by increased expression of the amyloid degrading enzymes neprilysin and insulin degrading enzyme, while in transfected HEK293 cells, GW742 activated a neprilysin promoter driving luciferase expression. These results suggest that, as found for some PPARgamma agonists, PPARdelta agonists can also reduce amyloid burden likely to be mediated by effects on amyloid clearance.",M1
19859965,"DHA diet reduces AD pathology in young APPswe/PS1 Delta E9 transgenic mice: possible gender effects.Epidemiological and clinical trial findings suggest that consumption of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) lowers the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined the effects of short-term (3 months) DHA enriched diet on <e>plaque</e> deposition and synaptic defects in forebrain of young APPswe/PS1 Delta E9 transgenic (tg) and non-transgenic (ntg) mice. Gas chromatography revealed a significant increase in DHA concomitant with a decrease of arachidonic acid in both brain and liver in mice fed with DHA. Female tg mice consumed relatively more food daily than ntg female mice, independent of diet. Plaque load was significantly reduced in the cortex, ventral hippocampus and striatum of female APPswe/PS1 Delta E9 tg mice on DHA diet compared to female tg mice on control diet. Immunoblot quantitation of the APOE receptor, LR11, which is involved in APP trafficking and A beta production, were unchanged in mice on DHA or control diets. Moreover drebrin levels were significantly increased in the hippocampus of tg mice on the DHA diet. Finally, in vitro DHA treatment prevented amyloid toxicity in cell cultures. Our findings support the concept that increased DHA consumption may play and important role in reducing brain insults in female AD patients.",M1
19859962,"Recurrent systemic infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae do not aggravate the course of experimental neurodegenerative diseases.Neurological symptoms of patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) often worsen during infections. We assessed the disease-modulating effects of recurrent systemic infections with the most frequent respiratory pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae, on the course of AD, PD, and ALS in mouse models of these neurodegenerative diseases [transgenic Tg2576 mice, (Thy1)-[A30P]alpha SYN mice, and Tg(SOD1-G93A) mice]. Mice were repeatedly challenged intraperitoneally with live S. pneumoniae type 3 and treated with ceftriaxone for 3 days. Infection caused an increase of interleukin-6 concentrations in brain homogenates. The clinical status of (Thy1)-[A30P]alpha SYN mice and Tg(SOD1-G93A) mice was monitored by repeated assessment with a clinical score. Motor performance was controlled by the tightrope test and the rotarod test. In Tg2576 mice, spatial memory and learning deficits were assessed in the Morris water maze. In none of the three mouse models onset or course of the disease as evaluated by the clinical tests was affected by the recurrent systemic infections performed. Levels of alpha-synuclein in brains of (Thy1)-[A30P]alpha SYN mice did not differ between infected animals and control animals. <e>Plaque</e> sizes and concentrations of A beta 1-40 and A beta 1-42 were not significantly different in brains of infected and uninfected Tg2576 mice. In conclusion, onset and course of disease in mouse models of three common neurodegenerative disorders were not influenced by repeated systemic infections with S. pneumoniae, indicating that the effect of moderately severe acute infections on the course of neurodegenerative diseases may be less pronounced than suspected.",M1
19846589,"Neurotransmitters and energy metabolites in amyloid-bearing APP(SWE)xPSEN1dE9 Mouse Brain.Alzheimer's disease is characterized by amyloid peptide formation and deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic loss and central cholinergic dysfunction, dysfunction of energy metabolism, and dementia; however, the interactions between these hallmarks remain poorly defined. We studied a well characterized mouse model of amyloid deposition, the doubly transgenic APP(SWE)xPSEN1dE9 mouse. At 10 to 14 months of age, these mice had high levels of amyloid peptides (6.6 microg/g wet weight) and widespread amyloid <e>plaques</e>. Extracellular levels of acetylcholine (ACh) were determined by microdialysis in the hippocampus and were comparable with nontransgenic mice from the same colony. In the open field, both mouse strains responded with a 3-fold increase of hippocampal ACh release. Exploratory behavior of the transgenic mice appeared normal. Infusion of scopolamine evoked 5- to 6-fold increases of ACh levels in both mouse strains. High-affinity choline uptake and cholinesterase activities were identical in both mouse lines. Extracellular levels of glucose and glycerol were similar in control and transgenic mice, whereas lactate levels were slightly (p = 0.06) and glutamate levels significantly (p = 0.02) lower in transgenic mice. Exploration caused increases of glucose and lactate, whereas infusion of scopolamine (1 microM) increased glucose but not lactate. Glutamate levels were increased by scopolamine, whereas glycerol remained constant under all the conditions. We conclude that amyloid peptide production and plaque deposition causes minor changes in cholinergic function and energy metabolites in transgenic mice in vivo. Amyloid peptide formation and/or deposition may not be sufficient for long-term cholinergic or metabolic dysfunction.",M1
19834824,"Coenzyme Q10 reduces beta-amyloid <e>plaque</e> in an APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.We previously reported that coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) could reduce intracellular deposition in an aged transgenic mouse model. Here, we further tested the effect of CoQ10 on amyloid plaque in an amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By using immunohistochemistry and magnetic resonance imaging to determine the burden of amyloid plaque, we found that oral administration of CoQ10 can efficiently reduce the burden of the plaques in this mouse model. These data demonstrate that in addition to reducing intracellular deposition of Abeta, CoQ10 can also reduce plaque pathology. Our study further supports the use of CoQ10 as a therapeutic candidate for AD.",M1
19823761,"Pyroglutamate Abeta pathology in APP/PS1KI mice, sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease cases.The presence of Abeta(pE3) (N-terminal truncated Abeta starting with pyroglutamate) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has received considerable attention since the discovery that this peptide represents a dominant fraction of Abeta peptides in senile <e>plaques</e> of AD brains. This was later confirmed by other reports investigating AD and Down's syndrome postmortem brain tissue. Importantly, Abeta(pE3) has a higher aggregation propensity, and stability, and shows an increased toxicity compared to full-length Abeta. We have recently shown that intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta(pE3) peptides induces a severe neuron loss and an associated neurological phenotype in the TBA2 mouse model for AD. Given the increasing interest in Abeta(pE3), we have generated two novel monoclonal antibodies which were characterized as highly specific for Abeta(pE3) peptides and herein used to analyze plaque deposition in APP/PS1KI mice, an AD model with severe neuron loss and learning deficits. This was compared with the plaque pattern present in brain tissue from sporadic and familial AD cases. Abundant plaques positive for Abeta(pE3) were present in patients with sporadic AD and familial AD including those carrying mutations in APP (arctic and Swedish) and PS1. Interestingly, in APP/PS1KI mice we observed a continuous increase in Abeta(pE3) plaque load with increasing age, while the density for Abeta(1-x ) plaques declined with aging. We therefore assume that, in particular, the peptides starting with position 1 of Abeta are N-truncated as disease progresses, and that, Abeta(pE3) positive plaques are resistant to age-dependent degradation likely due to their high stability and propensity to aggregate.",M1
19812338,"A reporter of local dendritic translocation shows <e>plaque</e>- related loss of neural system function in APP-transgenic mice.Although neuronal communication is thought to be summated within local dendritic segments, no technique is currently available to monitor activity in vivo at this level of resolution. To overcome this challenge, we developed an optical reporter of neuronal activity using the coding sequence of Venus, flanked by short stretches of the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions from calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIalpha (CAMKIIalpha). This reporter takes advantage of the fact that CAMKIIalpha mRNA is transported to the dendrite and locally translated in an activity-dependent manner. Using adeno-associated virus, we used this reporter to study neuronal activity in adult mice. Exposure of the mice to an enriched environment led to enhancement of Venus expression in dendritic segments of somatosensory cortex, demonstrating in vivo that dendritic mRNA translocation and local translation occur in response to physiologically relevant stimuli. We then used this system to examine the impact of Alzheimer-related local amyloid-beta deposits on neural system function to test the hypothesis that plaques are toxic. In APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, neurons close to plaques, and dendritic segments close to plaques, both showed diminished fluorescent intensity and therefore neuronal activity. In contrast to wild-type mice, fluorescent intensity in neurons near plaques in transgenic mice did not increase after environmental enrichment. These data indicate that neuronal activity in dendritic segments and neurons in the vicinity of a plaque is decreased compared with wild-type mice, supporting the idea that plaques are a focal lesion leading to impaired neural system function.",M1
19799879,"Effects of donepezil on amyloid-beta and synapse density in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.Donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is an approved drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although extensive studies have demonstrated the symptomatic efficacy of donepezil treatment in patients with AD, the effects of donepezil, if any, on the AD process are not known. In this study, we sought to determine whether long-term administration of donepezil would slow amyloid <e>plaque</e> deposition or confer neuronal protection in a mouse model of AD. We used quantitative light and electron microscopy to investigate the effects of long-term administration (from 3 to 9 months of age for 6 months of treatment) of donepezil (1, 2, 4 mg/kg, in drinking water) on tissue amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein, plaque deposition, synaptic protein (synaptophysin), and synapse density in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. Administration of the 4 mg/kg dose of donepezil, as compared to vehicle and lower doses of donepezil, significantly reduced brain tissue soluble Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), Abeta plaque number, and burden at the study end point in Tg2576 mice. The dose of 4 mg/kg of donepezil also significantly increased synaptic density in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in Tg2576 mice. However, a significant change of the synaptophysin-positive bouton in the hippocampus was not observed. These results suggest that a higher dose of donepezil may have a measurable impact on tissue level of Abeta protein and plaque deposition and may prevent synapse loss in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD.",M1
19795195,"The role of cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in ROS and amyloid <e>plaque</e> formation.The multiple dysfunctional changes associated with a brain affected with Alzheimer's disease (AD) makes the understanding of primary pathogenic mechanisms challenging. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with almost every neurodegenerative disease and neurodegenerative-related event. Alzheimer's disease is no exception with data suggesting mitochondrial malfunctions ranging from improper organelle dynamics, defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), oxidative stress, and harmful beta amyloid (Abeta) associations with the mitochondria. A major change often associated with AD is impairment of the electron transport chain at complex IV: cytochrome c oxidase (COX). This mini-review concentrates on recent work by our group that sheds light on the role COX deficiency plays in the pathophysiology of AD using a transgenic mouse model. Results suggest that neuronal COX deficiency does not increase oxidative stress and nor increases amyloidal formations in vivo. Conclusions from this work also suggest that Abeta formation is a cause of COX deficiency as opposed to the consequence.",M1
19779135,"Enrichment of cholesterol in microdissected Alzheimer's disease senile <e>plaques</e> as assessed by mass spectrometry.Extensive knowledge of the protein components of the senile plaques, one of the hallmark lesions of Alzheimer's disease, has been acquired over the years, but their lipid composition remains poorly known. Evidence suggests that cholesterol contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, its presence within senile plaques has never been ascertained with analytic methods. Senile plaques were microdissected from sections of the isocortex in three Braak VI Alzheimer's disease cases and compared with a similar number of samples from the adjoining neuropil, free of amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) deposit. Two cases were apo epsilon 4/apo epsilon 3, and one case was apo epsilon 3/apoepsilon3. A known quantity of (13)C-labeled cholesterol was added to the samples as a standard. After hexane extraction, cholesterol content was analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The mean concentration of free cholesterol was 4.25 +/- 0.1 attomoles/microm(3) in the senile plaques and 2.2 +/- 0.49 attomoles/microm(3) in the neuropil (t = 4.41, P &lt; 0.0009). The quantity of free cholesterol per senile plaque (67 +/- 16 femtomol) is similar to the published quantity of A beta peptide. The highly significant increase in the cholesterol concentration, associated with the increased risk of Alzheimer's disease linked to the apo epsilon 4 allele, suggests new pathogenetic mechanisms.",M1
19744481,"Oligomers of beta-amyloid are sequestered into and seed new <e>plaques</e> in the brains of an AD mouse model.Amyloid plaque deposition in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, but recent evidence indicates that the disease may be primarily caused by soluble amyloid-beta (1-42) (Abeta) oligomers or Abeta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs). ADDLs induce cognitive deficits in animal models and are thought to assemble in vitro by a mechanism apart from plaque formation. To investigate the in vivo relationship of ADDLs and plaques, biotin-labeled ADDLs (bADDLs) or amylin oligomers (bAMs) were injected into the hippocampus of hAPP overexpressing mice. The brains were collected 1 or 5 weeks after the last treatment and were processed for immunohistochemistry. Staining of tissue 1 week post-treatment showed bADDLs had diffused throughout the tissue and incorporated into plaques. Additionally, small deposits of thioflavin S-negative bADDLs were observed. At 5 weeks post-treatment, thioflavin S-positive material continued to accumulate around plaques containing bADDLs. Thioflavin S-positive material also accrued around bADDL deposits, implying that bADDLs were capable of seeding new plaques. In contrast, bAMs cleared from the brain and did not accumulate in plaques. Together, these data indicate that ADDLs are able to contribute to in vivo plaque formation in a peptide-specific manner.",M1
19735296,"Accumulation of reelin-positive <e>plaques</e> is accompanied by a decline in basal forebrain projection neurons during normal aging.Besides its critical role during neurodevelopment, the extracellular glycoprotein reelin is also a pivotal regulator of adult synaptic function and plasticity, and altered reelin-mediated signalling has been suggested to contribute to neuronal dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease. We have recently discovered, in aged rodents and non-human primates, a pronounced decline in reelin-positive interneurons and concomitant accumulation of reelin in extracellular amyloid-like deposits, both being associated with episodic-like memory impairments. Here, we report that these age-related neuropathological changes in hippocampus, entorhinal and piriform cortices of aged wild-type mice are accompanied by abnormal axonal varicosities and altered expression profiles of calcium-binding proteins in plaque-dense areas, as well as a significant reduction in the number of parvalbumin-positive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic projection neurons in basal forebrain areas, including medial septum (MS), ventral and horizontal diagonal Band of Broca (VDB/HDB) and substantia innominata (SI), compared with young subjects. In addition, a significant reduction in the number of choline acetyltransferase-positive cholinergic projection neurons was evident in the HDB/SI area but not in the MS of aged compared with young wild-type mice. No reelin-deposits were found in these basal forebrain regions. Our findings suggest that the elevated reelin plaque load in the projection areas of afferent subcortical GABAergic and cholinergic neurons including hippocampus, entorhinal and piriform cortices affects the axonal integrity and survival of these neurons, potentially contributing to the cognitive impairments observed in aged wild-type mice.",M1
19732796,"A novel technique for simultaneous bilateral brain infusions in a mouse model of neurodegenerative disease.A common problem faced by researchers using transgenic models to study disease is the phenotypic variability that exists within a group or colony of animals. Significant pathological analyses thus often require large numbers of mice to perform. Many lines of transgenic mice harboring the gene for human amyloid precursor protein (APP) with different mutations causing familial Alzheimer's disease have been developed over the past decade to study <e>plaque</e> deposition and other aspects of AD. However, variations in size, density, plaque number, and total amyloid load between animals of the same age and genotype have been identified by our lab and others. Therefore, to study the effects of compounds on amyloid pathology, it was imperative to develop a technique that would allow each brain hemisphere to receive different infusions. We have developed catheters that facilitate simultaneous bilateral infusion in mouse brains, thereby using the contralateral hemisphere of the same animal as an internal control while studying, for example, the effect of compounds on amyloid plaques, a pathological hallmark of the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several molecules have been identified within the plaques including the major component, the Abeta peptide, and two inflammation-related proteins, apolipoprotein E (apoE) and the serine protease inhibitor alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT). In these experiments, ACT was infused unilaterally over a period of 28 days into the parenchyma and lateral ventricles of PS/APP mice and observed to associate with amyloid plaques, with minimal mortality. Utilizing the ACT/Abeta interaction, details of this procedure are discussed here in detail.",M1
19710322,"Characterizing the appearance and growth of amyloid <e>plaques</e> in APP/PS1 mice.Amyloid plaques are primarily composed of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and are a pathological signature of Alzheimer's disease. However, the factors that influence the dynamics of amyloid plaque formation and growth in vivo are largely unknown. Using serial intravital multiphoton microscopy through a thinned-skull cranial window in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, we found that amyloid plaques appear and grow over a period of weeks before reaching a mature size. Growth was more prominent early after initial plaque formation: plaques grew faster in 6-month-old compared with 10-month-old mice. Plaque growth rate was also size-related, as smaller plaques exhibited more rapid growth relative to larger plaques. Alterations in interstitial Abeta concentrations were associated with changes in plaque growth. Parallel studies using multiphoton microscopy and in vivo microdialysis revealed that pharmacological reduction of soluble extracellular Abeta by as little as 20-25% was associated with a dramatic decrease in plaque formation and growth. Furthermore, this small reduction in Abeta synthesis was sufficient to reduce amyloid plaque load in 6-month-old but not 10-month-old mice, suggesting that treatment early in disease pathogenesis may be more effective than later treatment. In contrast to thinned-skull windows, no significant plaque growth was observed under open-skull windows, which demonstrated extensive microglial and astrocytic activation. Together, these findings indicate that individual amyloid plaque growth in vivo occurs over a period of weeks and may be influenced by interstitial Abeta concentration as well as reactive gliosis.",M1
19703562,"An amyloid-beta protofibril-selective antibody prevents amyloid formation in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.Human genetics link Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis to excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in brain, but the symptoms do not correlate with senile <e>plaque</e> burden. Since soluble Abeta aggregates can cause synaptic dysfunctions and memory deficits, these species could contribute to neuronal dysfunction and dementia. Here we explored selective targeting of large soluble aggregates, Abeta protofibrils, as a new immunotherapeutic strategy. The highly protofibril-selective monoclonal antibody mAb158 inhibited in vitro fibril formation and protected cells from Abeta protofibril-induced toxicity. When the mAb158 antibody was administered for 4 months to plaque-bearing transgenic mice with both the Arctic and Swedish mutations (tg-ArcSwe), Abeta protofibril levels were lowered while measures of insoluble Abeta were unaffected. In contrast, when treatment began before the appearance of senile plaques, amyloid deposition was prevented and Abeta protofibril levels diminished. Therapeutic intervention with mAb158 was however not proven functionally beneficial, since place learning depended neither on treatment nor transgenicity. Our findings suggest that Abeta protofibrils can be selectively cleared with immunotherapy in an animal model that display highly insoluble Abeta deposits, similar to those of Alzheimer's disease brain.",M1
19685385,"[The role of blood-brain barrier in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia--implications for immunological therapies for <e>plaque</e> dissolution]Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting more than 27 million people worldwide and leading to severe social-economic problems. One characteristic hallmark of AD--the amyloid plaques--are still being discussed to be one important triggering factor. However, current animal and autopsy studies refer to soluble and highly toxic A block oligomers as the deadly agent for the neurons. Current therapies mainly rely on the abatement of symptoms without antagonizing the etiology of the disease. Potential new approaches address reduced production, increased degradation and/or evacuation of toxic A block peptides from the brain. Among others one important group of target-proteins are the ABC transporters of the blood-brain barrier which contribute importantly to the detoxification of the brain. Changes of specific transport functions evoke important alterations for the known pathogenesis and future therapies of AD, especially approaches that target plaque dissolution and plaque reduction.",M1
19633196,"Neural stem cells improve cognition via BDNF in a transgenic model of Alzheimer disease.Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation represents an unexplored approach for treating neurodegenerative disorders associated with cognitive decline such as Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we used aged triple transgenic mice (3xTg-AD) that express pathogenic forms of amyloid precursor protein, presenilin, and tau to investigate the effect of neural stem cell transplantation on AD-related neuropathology and cognitive dysfunction. Interestingly, despite widespread and established Ass <e>plaque</e> and neurofibrillary tangle pathology, hippocampal neural stem cell transplantation rescues the spatial learning and memory deficits in aged 3xTg-AD mice. Remarkably, cognitive function is improved without altering Ass or tau pathology. Instead, the mechanism underlying the improved cognition involves a robust enhancement of hippocampal synaptic density, mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Gain-of-function studies show that recombinant BDNF mimics the beneficial effects of NSC transplantation. Furthermore, loss-of-function studies show that depletion of NSC-derived BDNF fails to improve cognition or restore hippocampal synaptic density. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that neural stem cells can ameliorate complex behavioral deficits associated with widespread Alzheimer disease pathology via BDNF.",M1
19584430,"Effects of stress and stress hormones on amyloid-beta protein and <e>plaque</e> deposition.Growing evidence indicates that physical and psychosocial stressors, in part acting through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, may accelerate the process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this review, we summarize recent research related to the effects of stress and stress hormones on the various disease process elements associated with AD. Specifically, we focus on the relationships among chronic stressors, HPA axis activity, amyloid-beta protein, and amyloid-beta plaque deposition in mouse models of AD. The potential mechanisms by which stress and stress-related components, especially corticotrophin-releasing factor and its receptors, influence the pathogenesis of AD are discussed.",M1
19557827,"Progranulin expression correlates with dense-core amyloid <e>plaque</e> burden in Alzheimer disease mouse models.Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). In addition, innate inflammatory responses, such as those mediated by microglia, are integral to the pathogenesis of AD. Interestingly, only dense-core plaques and not diffuse plaques are associated with neuritic and inflammatory pathology in AD patients as well as in mouse AD models. However, the precise neuropathological changes that occur in the brain in response to amyloid deposition are largely unknown. To study the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for Abeta-mediated neuropathology, we performed a gene expression analysis on laser-microdissected brain tissue of Tg2576 and APPPS1 mice that are characterized by different types of amyloid plaques and genetic backgrounds. Data were validated by image and biochemical analyses on different ages of Tg2576, APPPS1, and Abeta42-depositing BRI-Abeta42 mice. Consistent with an important role of inflammatory responses in AD, we identified progranulin (mouse Grn; human GRN) as one of the top ten up-regulated molecules in Tg2576 ( approximately 8-fold increased) and APPPS1 ( approximately 2-fold increased) mice compared to littermate controls, and among the eight significantly up-regulated molecules common to both mouse models. In addition, Grn levels correlated significantly with amyloid load, especially the dense-core plaque pathology (p &lt; 0.001). We further showed that Grn is up-regulated in microglia and neurons and neurites around dense-core plaques, but not in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, as has been shown in AD patients. Our data therefore support the ongoing use of these mouse models in drug trials, especially those with anti-inflammatory compounds. Moreover, the correlation of Grn with increasing disease severity in AD mouse models prompts human studies exploring the viability of GRN as a disease biomarker. Because loss of GRN has recently been shown to cause frontotemporal dementia and serves as a risk factor for AD, the strong GRN reactivity around dense-core plaques is consistent with an important role of this factor in AD pathogenesis.",M1
19552926,"Comparison study of amyloid PET and voxel-based morphometry analysis in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.Two techniques employed for the early diagnosis of dementia are the imaging of amyloid-beta protein using positron emission tomography (PET) and voxel-based morphometry analysis of MRI (VBM-MRI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of amyloid PET and VBM-MRI for the early diagnosis and tracking of the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neuritic <e>plaque</e> burden and gray matter losses were evaluated using [11C]BF-227-PET and VBM-MRI in 12 healthy controls, 13 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), including 6 who converted to AD and 7 who did not convert, and 15 AD patients. The AD patients and the MCI converters exhibited a neocortical retention of BF-227 and parahippocampal gray matter loss shown by VBM-MRI. The MCI converters were more clearly distinguished from the MCI non-converters in BF-227-PET than VBM-MRI. The combined sample of the MCI converters and AD patients showed a significant correlation of MMSE scores with the global gray matter loss, but not with the BF-227 retention. These findings suggest that amyloid PET using [11C]BF-227 is better suited for the prediction of conversion from MCI to AD, while VBM-MRI appears to be better suited for tracking the severity of dementia.",M1
19535990,"Lewy body pathology in normal elderly subjects.Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are the hallmark neuropathologic findings in Parkinson disease, Parkinson disease with dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and other alpha-synucleinopathies. They have also been described in the brains of normal older individuals and referred to as incidental Lewy body disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (Lewy body pathology [LBP]) in 139 autopsies from our normal volunteer control group of the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center. All subjects were followed longitudinally and were cognitively normal and without any type of movement disorder, neuropsychiatric features, or other CNS findings. The brains of 33 of 139 normal subjects contained LBP in various regions. The most common regions involved were the medulla (26%), amygdala (24%), pons (20%), and midbrain (20%). No mean statistical differences were found between those with and without LBP on any demographic or cognitive variable, Braak stage, or neurofibrillary tangle and neuritic <e>plaque</e> quantitation. An explanation for the high prevalence of LBP in our elderly, well-educated study group is not clear, although it does not seem to be related to aging or the presence of Alzheimer disease pathology. Overall, our findings support the concept that incidental Lewy body disease most likely represents preclinical or presymptomatic Parkinson disease, Parkinson disease with dementia, or dementia with Lewy bodies.",M1
19531156,"Amyloid beta and impairment in multiple memory systems in older transgenic APP TgCRND8 mice.The relationship between amyloid beta and cognitive dysfunction in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease has been evaluated predominantly with the spatial reference memory version of the water maze task. However, as Alzheimer's disease encompasses decline in multiple memory systems, it is important to also utilize non-spatial tasks to fully characterize the role of amyloid on behaviour in animal models. We used the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease to evaluate the effect of amyloid on spatial reference memory, as well as on the non-spatial task of acquisition of conditioned taste aversion, and on the procedural task of swimming to a visible platform. We demonstrate that 8- to 12-month-old TgCRND8 mice are significantly impaired in all three tasks, and that the levels of soluble amyloid beta are significantly correlated with impairment in spatial reference memory, but not with impairment in conditioned taste aversion or swimming to a visible platform. Insoluble fractions of amyloid, which correspond closely to amyloid <e>plaque</e> burden in the brain, are not associated with any behavioural measure. Our study extends the characterization of the model to stages of advanced amyloid pathology and demonstrates that older TgCRND8 mice are impaired in multiple memory systems, including procedural tasks, which are spared at younger ages. The lack of association between amyloid plaques and memory decline supports clinical findings in Alzheimer's patients.",M1
19524673,"Simvastatin improves cerebrovascular function and counters soluble amyloid-beta, inflammation and oxidative stress in aged APP mice.Cerebrovascular dysfunctions appear to contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and the associated cognitive decline. Recently, it has been suggested that statins could be beneficial to AD patients independently from their cholesterol-lowering effects. Using 10 month-old amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice (APP mice), we sought to reverse cerebrovascular, neuronal and memory impairments with simvastatin (20 mg/kg/day, 8 weeks). Simvastatin improved reactivity of cerebral arteries, rescued the blood flow response to neuronal activation, attenuated oxidative stress and inflammation, and reduced cortical soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels and the number of Abeta <e>plaque</e>-related dystrophic neurites. However, at such an advanced stage of the pathology, it failed to reduce Abeta plaque load and normalize cholinergic and memory deficits. These findings demonstrate that low-dose simvastatin treatment in aged APP mice largely salvages cerebrovascular function and has benefits on several AD landmarks, which could explain some of the positive effects of statins reported in AD patients.",M1
19521084,"Large vessel cerebral atherosclerosis is not in direct association with neuropathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease.INTRODUCTION: Cerebral hypoperfusion caused by large vessel atherosclerosis has been suggested to be associated with the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Atherosclerosis and AD share risk factors such as age, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE epsilon4) allele. We studied the association between atherosclerosis of the circle of Willis (CW) and AD neuropathology in a large autopsy sample. METHODS: The present study comprised a consecutive autopsy series (n = 466) representing noninstitutionalized general population aged 50 years and over (mean 70.8, SD 11.5 years). The atherosclerosis of CW was scored semiquantitatively and the amyloid <e>plaque</e> (AP) load in the frontal cortex and the number of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the hippocampus were measured. RESULTS: In a linear regression model, AP percentage area was associated with age (p &lt; 0.0001) and APOE epsilon4 allele (p &lt; 0.0001), but not with CW score (p = 0.70) or gender (p = 0.11). Similarly, the NFT count was predicted only by age (p &gt; 0.0001), and not by CW score (p = 0.36), gender (p = 0.41) or APOE epsilon4 allele (p = 0.072). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that cerebral large vessel atherosclerosis is not in direct association with APs or NFTs - hallmarks of AD neuropathology.",M1
19519302,"Cell cycle re-entry in Alzheimer's disease: a major neuropathological characteristic?Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive brain disease that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills. With over 26 million patients in 2006, AD is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Different hypotheses have been suggested to explain the pathogenesis of AD, like those involving inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction or oxidative stress. Many of these studies have addressed amyloid <e>plaque</e> formation, tau hyperphosphorylation and apoptotic neuronal loss, the three main histopathological hallmarks of this disease. Increasing evidences, however, suggest another feature that can also be considered a neuropathological marker for AD: ectopic cell cycle re-entry. Cell cycle events have been frequently registered in the brains of AD patients. Although the exact starting point of cell cycle re-entry remains unclear, a number of subsequent cascades, which include events such as kinase upregulation, DNA replication and cytoskeletal alterations, have already been described. There are also increasing reports suggesting that cell cycle reactivation in mature neurons occurs as part of the apoptotic process. Upon a brief overview of the different theories and models addressing cell cycle reactivation in AD, we will describe possible mechanisms that trigger cell cycle re-entry, with special attention to links between this feature and the main neuropathological markers of AD. Finally, we will also analyze possible similarities between cell cycle dysregulation in AD and in other pathologies, such as Prion-Related Encephalopathies.",M1
19505450,"The activation of cannabinoid CB2 receptors stimulates in situ and in vitro beta-amyloid removal by human macrophages.The endocannabinoid system is a promising therapeutic target in a wide variety of diseases. However, the non-desirable psychotropic effects of natural and synthetic cannabinoids have largely counteracted their clinical usefulness. These effects are mostly mediated by cannabinoid receptors of the CB(1) type, that exhibit a wide distribution in neuronal elements of the CNS. Thus, the presence of other elements of this system in the CNS, such as CB(2) receptors, may open new possibilities for the development of cannabinoid-based therapies. These receptors are almost absent from the CNS in normal conditions but are up-regulated in glial cells under chronic neuroinflammatory stimuli, as has been described in Alzheimer's disease. To understand the functional role of these receptors, we tested their role in the process of beta-amyloid removal, that is currently considered as one of the most promising experimental approaches for the treatment of this disease. Our results show that a CB(2) agonist (JWH-015) is capable of inducing the removal of native beta-amyloid removal from human frozen tissue sections as well as of synthetic pathogenic peptide by a human macrophage cell line (THP-1). Remarkably, this effect was achieved at low doses (maximum effect at 10 nM) and was specific for this type of cells, as U373MG astrocytoma cells did not respond to the treatment. The effect was CB(2)-mediated, at least partially, as the selective CB(2) antagonist SR144528 prevented the JWH-015-induced <e>plaque</e> removal in situ. These data corroborate the possible therapeutic interest of CB(2) cannabinoid specific chemicals in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",M1

19481608,"Amyloid <e>plaques</e> in PSAPP mice bind less metal than plaques in human Alzheimer's disease.Amyloid beta (Abeta) is the primary component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plaques, a key pathological feature of the disease. Metal ions of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and calcium (Ca) are elevated in human amyloid plaques and are thought to be involved in neurodegeneration. Transgenic mouse models of AD also exhibit amyloid plaques, but fail to exhibit the high degree of neurodegeneration observed in humans. In this study, we imaged the Zn, Cu, Fe, and Ca ion distribution in the PSAPP transgenic mouse model representing end-stage AD (N=6) using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microprobe. In order to account for differences in density in the plaques, the relative protein content was imaged with synchrotron Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIRM) on the same samples. FTIRM results revealed a 61% increase in protein content in the plaques compared to the surrounding tissue. After normalizing to protein density, we found that the PSAPP plaques contained only a 29% increase in Zn and there was actually less Cu, Fe, and Ca in the plaque compared to the surrounding tissue. Since metal binding to Abeta is thought to induce redox chemistry that is toxic to neurons, the reduced metal binding in PSAPP mice is consistent with the lack of neurodegeneration in these animals. These findings were in stark contrast to the high metal ion content observed in human AD plaques, further implicating the role of metal ions in human AD pathology.",M1
19477243,"Synaptic transmission is impaired prior to <e>plaque</e> formation in amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing mice without altering behaviorally-correlated sharp wave-ripple complexes.One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of amyloid plaques in brains of affected patients. Several recent studies provided evidence that soluble oligomer forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta) rather than plaques determine cognitive decline. In vitro studies using artificial Abeta oligomer preparations suggest that such pathophysiology is caused by a specific impairment of synaptic function. We examined whether synaptic deficits occur before deposition of insoluble fibrillar Abeta by analyzing brain slices taken from young Tg2576 mice overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein. Excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampal CA1 region was strongly impaired before plaque development, suggesting a dissociation of an early synaptic impairment, probably caused by soluble oligomeric amyloid-beta, from subsequent plaque formation. At higher age neurotransmission was also decreased in wild type mice, paralleling a cognitive decline of normal aged animals. Memory formation in rats is accompanied by distinct hippocampal network oscillations. It has recently been shown that hippocampal gamma oscillations, a network correlate of exploratory behavior, are impaired in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-overexpressing mice. We determined whether sharp wave-ripple complexes, which contribute to memory consolidation during slow wave-sleep, are modified in Tg2576 mice. Interestingly, neither sharp waves nor superimposed ripples were changed at pre-plaque or plaque stages. During aging, however, there was a strong reduction of sharp wave frequency and ripple energy in wild type and APP-overexpressing animals. This indicates that the reported changes in network oscillations following APP-overexpression are specific for gamma oscillations, whereas aging has a more general effect on network properties. Taken together our data suggest that non-fibrillar forms of Abeta--possibly Abeta oligomers--specifically interfere with synaptic function in Tg2576, but do not globally alter memory-related network properties. We propose that mechanisms leading to Abeta-related cognitive decline are different from those related to aging.",M1
19465012,"A single dose of passive immunotherapy has extended benefits on synapses and neurites in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that impairs memory and cognition. One of the major neuropathological hallmarks is the accumulation of the extracellular senile <e>plaques</e> that are mainly composed of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein. Plaques are associated with synapse loss, dystrophic neurites and altered neurite trajectories. A reversal of such morphological changes has been observed days after single dose anti-Abeta immunotherapy. In this study we investigated the extended effects of a single dose of passive anti-Abeta immunotherapy on morphological changes associated with senile plaques. We found that although plaque burden was not reduced 30 days after immunotherapy, there were fewer dystrophic neurites around each plaque, a recovery of synapse density, and normalization of neurite curvature near plaques. Taken together these results suggest that a single dose of immunotherapy is sufficient to cause lasting benefits to the morphology of cortical neurons, implying substantial plasticity of neural circuits despite the continued presence of plaques.",M1
19457079,"Abeta43 is more frequent than Abeta40 in amyloid <e>plaque</e> cores from Alzheimer disease brains.One hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the extracellular deposition of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in senile plaques. Two major forms of Abeta are produced, 40 (Abeta40) and 42 (Abeta42) residues long. The most abundant form of Abeta is Abeta40, while Abeta42 is more hydrophobic and more prone to form toxic oligomers and the species of particular importance in early plaque formation. Thus, the length of the hydrophobic C-terminal seems to be very important for the oligomerization and neurotoxicity of the Abeta peptide. Here we investigated which Abeta species are deposited in AD brain. We analyzed plaque cores, prepared from occipital and frontal cortex, from sporadic and familial AD cases and performed a quantitative study using Abeta standard peptides. Cyanogen bromide was used to generate C-terminal Abeta fragments, which were analyzed by HPLC coupled to an electrospray ionisation ion trap mass spectrometer. We found a longer peptide, Abeta43, to be more frequent than Abeta40. No variants longer than Abeta43 could be observed in any of the brains. Immunohistochemistry was performed and was found to be in line with our findings. Abeta1-43 polymerizes rapidly and we suggest that this variant may be of importance for AD.",M1
19449368,"Morphological alterations to neurons of the amygdala and impaired fear conditioning in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) suffer from impaired memory and emotional disturbances, the pathogenesis of which is not entirely clear. In APP/PS1 transgenic mice, a model of AD in which amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulates in the brain, we have examined neurons in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA), a brain region crucial to establish cued fear conditioning. We found that although there was no neuronal loss in this region and Abeta <e>plaques</e> only occupy less than 1% of its volume, these mice froze for shorter times after auditory fear conditioning when compared to their non-transgenic littermates. We performed a three-dimensional analysis of projection neurons and of thousands of dendritic spines in the LA.

We suggest that these morphological changes in the neurons of the LA may contribute to the impaired auditory fear conditioning seen in this AD model.",M1
19433665,"Cortical alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and beta-amyloid levels in early Alzheimer disease.OBJECTIVE: To examine alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) binding and beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide load in superior frontal cortex (SFC) across clinical and neuropathological stages of Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN: Quantitative measures of alpha7 nAChR by [(3)H]methyllycaconitine binding and Abeta concentration by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in SFC were compared across subjects with antemortem clinical classification of no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, or mild to moderate AD, and with postmortem neuropathological diagnoses. SETTING: Academic medical center. Subjects Twenty-nine elderly retired clergy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative measures of alpha7 nAChR binding and Abeta peptide concentration in SFC. RESULTS: Higher concentrations of total Abeta peptide in SFC were associated with clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate AD (P = .02), lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores (P = .003), presence of cortical Abeta <e>plaques</e> (P = .02), and likelihood of AD diagnosis by the National Institute on Aging-Reagan criteria (P = .002). Increased alpha7 nAChR binding was associated with National Institute on Aging-Reagan diagnosis (P = .02) and, albeit weakly, the presence of cortical Abeta plaques (P = .08). There was no correlation between the 2 biochemical measures. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that during the clinical progression from normal cognition to neurodegenerative disease state, total Abeta peptide concentration increases while alpha7 nAChRs remain relatively stable in SFC. Regardless of subjects' clinical status, however, elevated alpha7 nAChR binding is associated with increased Abeta plaque pathology, supporting the hypothesis that cellular expression of these receptors may be upregulated selectively in Abeta plaque-burdened brain areas.",M1
19433657,"Association of glucocerebrosidase mutations with dementia with lewy bodies.BACKGROUND: Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene are associated with Lewy body (LB) disorders. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship of GBA mutations and APOE4 genotype to LB and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathological findings. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Academic research. PARTICIPANTS: The 187 subjects included patients with primary neuropathological diagnoses of LB disorders with or without AD changes (95 cases), randomly selected patients with AD (without significant LB pathological findings; 60 cases), and controls with neither LB nor AD pathological findings (32 cases). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GBA mutation status, APOE4 genotype, LB pathological findings (assessed according to the third report of the Dementia With Lewy Body Consortium), and Alzheimer <e>plaque</e> and tangle pathological findings (rated by criteria of Braak and Braak, the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease, and the National Institute on Aging-Reagan Institute). RESULTS: GBA mutations were found in 18% (34 of 187) of all subjects, including 28% (27 of 95) of those with primary LB pathological findings compared with 10% (6 of 60) of those with AD pathological findings and 3% (1 of 32) of those without AD or LB pathological findings (P=.001). GBA mutation status was significantly associated with the presence of cortical LBs (odds ratio, 6.48; 95% confidence interval, 2.45-17.16; P&lt;.001), after adjusting for sex, age at death, and presence of APOE4. GBA mutation carriers were significantly less likely to meet AD pathological diagnostic (National Institute on Aging-Reagan Institute intermediate or high likelihood) criteria (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.79; P=.01) after adjustment for sex, age at death, and APOE4. CONCLUSION: GBA mutations may be associated with pathologically  purer  LB disorders, characterized by more extensive (cortical) LB, and less severe AD pathological findings and may be a useful marker for LB disorders.",M1
19429012,"Differential regulation of toll-like receptor mRNAs in amyloid <e>plaque</e>-associated brain tissue of aged APP23 transgenic mice.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the pathological deposition of amyloid-beta protein in the aged brain. Inefficient clearance of amyloid-beta from brain tissue is believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of these deposits. Since amyloid-beta clearance likely involves activation of microglial cells via toll-like receptors and since these receptors and their signaling pathways are regarded as potential therapeutic targets, we have studied the expression of toll-like receptor (tlr) mRNAs in an animal model of AD (APP23 transgenic mice). Laser microdissection was used to harvest plaques, tissue surrounding plaques and plaque-free tissue from cortex of aged APP23 transgenic mice and age-matched controls. Real-time RT-PCR was employed to quantify expression levels of different tlr mRNAs in these tissues. This revealed a strong upregulation of tlr2, tlr4, tlr5, tlr7 and tlr9 mRNAs in plaque material compared to plaque-free tissue. In contrast, tlr3 was not significantly upregulated. Plaque-free tissue did not show an increased expression of any tlr mRNAs compared to age-matched control mice. Double-immunofluorescence for TLR2 and the microglial marker Iba1 was used to demonstrate localization of TLR2 on plaque-associated microglia. Taken together, these data show a strong upregulation of mRNAs encoding surface TLRs in plaque-associated brain tissue of aged APP23 transgenic mice. Since TLR-upregulation is restricted to plaques, modifying TLR-signaling may be a promising therapeutic strategy for plaque removal.",M1
19428622,"Transgenic Alzheimer mice in a semi-naturalistic environment: more <e>plaques</e>, yet not compromised in daily life.The behaviour of transgenic animals modelling human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typically characterised in artificial apparatuses rather than labour-intensively observing their spontaneous behaviour in the home environment. Here we report on an in-depth behavioural characterisation of the day-to-day life of a murine model for AD living in a large (6.6 m(2)) semi-naturalistic indoor enclosure. In a genotype-blind investigation, 40 different behavioural patterns of wildtype and transgenic animals were recorded at early ages, before plaques can be found in the brains of the transgenic mice; and later in life, when these mice are known to exhibit AD-like plaques. Basal stress hormone levels (corticosterone) and cerebral amyloid-beta depositions were determined, and compared with individually and group-housed mice from non-enriched standard cages. Semi-naturalistically housed transgenics could not be differentiated from wildtypes by their behavioural profiles nor by basal levels of corticosterone. Surprisingly, the brains of these transgenics revealed an even more pronounced plaque load than controls from standard-housing conditions. Behavioural traits are known to involve gene-environment interactions. Here we show for the first time that despite high beta-amyloid plaque load the day-to-day life of AD mice is not compromised when the genetic predisposition interacts with a generous physically and socially enriched environment.",M1
19423009,"Validation of an (18)F-labeled biphenylalkyne as a positron emission tomography imaging agent for beta-amyloid <e>plaques</e>.AIM: Recently, the feasibility of detecting amyloid plaques in the living brain by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has been successfully demonstrated. As such, imaging beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques in the brain may further advance the differential diagnosis of the disease and allow clinicians to measure the effectiveness of therapeutic drugs aimed at lowering plaques in the brain. We report herein the preclinical validation of a potential (18)F-labeled biphenylalkyne, AV-138, as a preliminary step toward developing the imaging agent for patients suspected of having Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In vitro binding was carried out in the homogenates prepared from postmortem AD brains with [(125)I]IMPY as the radioligand. [(18)F]AV-138 was successfully prepared using a tosylate precursor and Sumitomo modules for radiosynthesis. Similarly, specific binding of [(18)F]AV-138 (0.02-0.05 nM) to homogenates, prepared from gray and white matters of pooled AD patients and control subjects, was performed. Specific binding to A beta plaques was measured by autoradiography in AD brain sections (n=11), and the same brain sections were fluorescently stained with thioflavin-S (TF-S). Images of both radiolabeling and fluorescent staining of plaques obtained by a phosphor imager were used for correlation image analysis. RESULTS: As expected, AV-138 displayed a high binding affinity (K(i)=2.4+/-0.7 nM) in AD gray matter homogenates (due to its high level of A beta plaque accumulation). Specific binding can be clearly measured in the AD gray matter homogenates, but not in the AD white matters. Control brain homogenates, due to a lack of A beta plaques, also showed no specific binding. Furthermore, in vitro autoradiography of postmortem AD brain sections showed that the high binding signal of [(18)F]AV-138 was specifically due to A beta plaques. Fluorescent staining of plaques with TF-S correlated well with the radiolabeling of [(18)F]AV-138 in AD brain sections (r&gt;0.90). CONCLUSION: Taken together, these preliminary results strongly suggest that [(18)F]AV-138 is potentially useful for imaging A beta plaques in the living human brain.",M1
19422539,"Regional distribution of TDP-43 inclusions in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains: their relation to AD common pathology.Initially, trans activation responsive region (TAR)-DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) was considered to be a disease-specific component of ubiquitin-positive and tau-negative inclusions in the brains of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); however, it is now widely known that this protein also abnormally accumulates in neurons in other neurodegenerative diseases. On the basis of observation mainly in the medial temporal lobe, TDP-43-immunoreactive neuronal inclusions have been detected in 20-30% of Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. However, it is controversial whether these cases represent a combined disease, that is, mixed AD/FTLD-U. To address this issue, it is necessary to obtain more knowledge on the region-specific distribution of TDP-43 immunoreactivity and also about its relationship to AD common pathology. Here, we describe abnormal TDP-43 immunoreactivity in the medial temporal lobe in 5/16 AD patients (31%). Most of the depositions were cytoplasmic inclusions, mainly located in the subiculum and parahippocampal gyrus and rarely in dentate granular cells of the hippocampus. TDP-43-positive inclusions and senile <e>plaque</e>/neurofibrillary tangle distribution were not always identical, and intracellular colocalizations of TDP-43 and phospho-tau were also infrequent. The cases showing TDP-43-positive inclusions in the medial temporal lobe also showed abnormally highly dense TDP-43 immunoreactivity in the frontal, but not in the parietal and occipital cortices. Intracellularly, TDP-43-positive inclusions were highly ubiquitinated and colocalized with p62 immunoreactivity as well. Our findings suggest that abnormal TDP-43 deposition and AD pathology (formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) might occur independently. However, taken together with the results of previous reports, the distribution of TDP-43 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and frontal cortex in AD appear to be varying. We consider that it is still too early to determine that the TDP-43 accumulation is a part of AD pathology or result from a completely independent pathology.",M1

Recently, it was reported that hederacolchiside-E is an active ingredient of SK-PC-B70M that confers a neuroprotective effect against the cytotoxicity induced by Abeta(1-42) in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. SK-PC-B70M improves scopolamine-induced impairments of spatial working memory in rats. In the present study, we investigated whether SK-PC-B70M has a beneficial effect on the Tg2576 murine model of Alzheimer's disease. ELISA analysis revealed that the levels of soluble and insoluble forms of Abeta(1-42) in Tg2576 mice fed SK-PC-B70M (2000 ppm) from 11 months to 16 months of age were reduced to, respectively, 66% and 79% of the control Tg2576 mice. Anti-Abeta antibody-stained brain sections of Tg2576 mice with SK-PC-B70M (2000 ppm) consistently showed a reduction in <e>plaque</e> formation in the brain. Western blot analyses showed altered expressions of various cellular factors, such as up-regulation of transthyretin, phospho-ERK, and phospho-CREB in the brain treated with SK-PC-B70M. SK-PC-B70M suppressed the neuronal toxicity induced by H(2)O(2) in primary cortical culture. Moreover, biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), oxidized by-products of lipid peroxidation, were notably reduced in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice treated with SK-PC-B70M compared with the Tg2576 control. These results suggest that SK-PC-B70M attenuates AD-like pathology in the brain of Tg2576 mice.",M1
19388095,"MRI and histological analysis of beta-amyloid <e>plaques</e> in both human Alzheimer's disease and APP/PS1 transgenic mice.PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between MR image contrast associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and their histology and compare the histopathological basis of image contrast and the relaxation mechanism associated with Abeta plaques in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) and transgenic APP/PS1 mouse tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With the aid of the previously developed histological coil, T(2) (*)-weighted images and R(2) (*) parametric maps were directly compared with histology stains acquired from the same set of Alzheimer's and APP/PS1 tissue slices. RESULTS: The electron microscopy and histology images revealed significant differences in plaque morphology and associated iron concentration between AD and transgenic APP/PS1 mice tissue samples. For AD tissues, T(2) (*) contrast of Abeta-plaques was directly associated with the gradation of iron concentration. Plaques with significantly less iron load in the APP/PS1 animal tissues are equally conspicuous as the human plaques in the MR images. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a duality in the relaxation mechanism where both high focal iron concentration and highly compact fibrillar beta-amyloid masses cause rapid proton transverse magnetization decay. For human tissues, the former mechanism is likely the dominant source of R(2) (*) relaxation; for APP/PS1 animals, the latter is likely the major cause of increased transverse proton relaxation rate in Abeta plaques. The data presented are essential for understanding the histopathological underpinning of MRI measurement associated with Abeta plaques in humans and animals.",M1
19385666,"Myelin basic protein binds to and inhibits the fibrillar assembly of Abeta42 in vitro.The deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) fibrils into <e>plaques</e> within the brain parenchyma and along cerebral blood vessels is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta peptides are produced through the successive cleavage of the Abeta precursor protein by beta- and gamma-secretase, producing peptides between 39 and 43 amino acids in length. The most common of these are Abeta40 (the most abundant) and Abeta42. Abeta42 is more fibrillogenic than Abeta40 and has been implicated in early Abeta plaque deposition. Our previous studies determined that myelin basic protein (MBP) was capable of inhibiting fibril formation of a highly fibrillogenic Abeta peptide containing both E22Q (Dutch) and D23N (Iowa) mutations associated with familial forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy [Hoos, M. D., et al. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 9952-9961]. In this study, we show through a combination of biochemical and ultrastructural techniques that MBP is also capable of inhibiting the beta-sheet fibrillar assembly of the normal Abeta42 peptide. These findings suggest that MBP may play a role in regulating the deposition of Abeta42 and thereby also may regulate the early formation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.",M1
19381658,"Classification and basic pathology of Alzheimer disease.The lesions of Alzheimer disease include accumulation of proteins, losses of neurons and synapses, and alterations related to reactive processes. Extracellular Abeta accumulation occurs in the parenchyma as diffuse, focal or stellate deposits. It may involve the vessel walls of arteries, veins and capillaries. The cases in which the capillary vessel walls are affected have a higher probability of having one or two apoepsilon 4 alleles. Parenchymal as well as vascular Abeta deposition follows a stepwise progression. Tau accumulation, probably the best histopathological correlate of the clinical symptoms, takes three aspects: in the cell body of the neuron as neurofibrillary tangle, in the dendrites as neuropil threads, and in the axons forming the senile <e>plaque</e> neuritic corona. The progression of tau pathology is stepwise and stereotyped from the entorhinal cortex, through the hippocampus, to the isocortex. The neuronal loss is heterogeneous and area-specific. Its mechanism is still discussed. The timing of the synaptic loss, probably linked to Abeta peptide itself, maybe as oligomers, is also controversial. Various clinico-pathological types of Alzheimer disease have been described, according to the type of the lesions (plaque only and tangle predominant), the type of onset (focal onset), the cause (genetic or sporadic) and the associated lesions (Lewy bodies, vascular lesions, hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43 inclusions and argyrophilic grain disease).",M1
19374683,"Abeta aggregation and possible implications in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) because it is a major component of the extracellular <e>plaque</e> found in AD brains. Increased Abeta levels correlate with the cognitive decline observed in AD. Sporadic AD cases are thought to be chiefly associated with lack of Abeta clearance from the brain, unlike familial AD which shows increased Abeta production. Abeta aggregation leading to deposition is an essential event in AD. However, the factors involved in Abeta aggregation and accumulation in sporadic AD have not been completely characterized. This review summarizes studies that have examined the factors that affect Abeta aggregation and toxicity. By necessity these are studies that are performed with recombinant-derived or chemically synthesized Abeta. The studies therefore are not done in animals but in cell culture, which includes neuronal cells, other mammalian cells and, in some cases, non-mammalian cells that also appear susceptible to Abeta toxicity. An understanding of Abeta oligomerization may lead to better strategies to prevent AD.",M1
19355934,"Critical issues for successful immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease: development of biomarkers and methods for early detection and intervention.Over the last 10 years, promising data has emerged from both animal and human studies that both active immunization with amyloid-beta (Abeta) as well as passive immunization with anti-Abeta antibodies offer promise as therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data from animal models suggests that antibodies to Abeta through several mechanisms can decrease Abeta deposition, decrease Abeta -associated damage such as dystrophic neurite formation, and improve behavioral performance. Data from human studies suggests that active immunization can result in <e>plaque</e> clearance and that passive immunotherapy might result in slowing of cognitive decline. Despite this, a recent analysis from a phase I trial that involved active immunization with Abeta42, while not powered to determine efficacy, suggested no large effect of active immunization despite the fact that plaque clearance was very prominent in some subjects. An important issue to consider is when active or passive immunization targeting Abeta has the chance to be most effective. Clinico-pathological and biomarker studies have shown that in terms of the time course of AD, Abeta deposition probably begins about 10-15 years prior to symptom onset (preclinical AD) and that tau aggregation in tangles and in neurites does not begin to accelerate and build up in larger amounts in the neocortex until just prior to symptom onset. By the time the earliest clinical signs of AD emerge, Abeta deposition may be close to reaching its peak and tangle formation and neuronal cell loss is substantial though still not at its maximal extent. Since immunization targeting Abeta does not appear to have major effects on tangle pathology, for immunization to have the most chance for success, performing clinical trials in individuals who are cognitively only very mildly impaired or even in those with preclinical AD would likely offer a much better chance for success. Current work with AD biomarkers suggests that such individuals can now be identified and it seems likely that targeting this population with immunization strategies targeting Abeta would offer the best chance of success.",M1

Despite the dispersal of substantial plaque material, vaccination did not constitute even a partial eradication of brain amyloid as water soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) 40/42 increased in the gray matter compared to sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and total brain Abeta levels were not decreased. Significant aspects of AD pathology were unaffected by vaccination with both vascular amyloid and hyper-phosphorylated tau deposits appeared refractory to this therapy. In addition, vaccination resulted in the consequential and drastic expansion of the white matter (WM) amyloid pool to levels without precedent in sporadic AD patients. Although vaccination disrupted amyloid plaques, this therapy did not enhance long-term cognitive function or necessarily halt neurodegeneration. The intricate involvement of vascular pathology in AD evolution and the firm recalcitrance of vessel-associated amyloid to antibody-mediated disruption suggest that immunization therapies might be more effective if administered on a prophylactic basis before vascular impairment and well ahead of any clinically evident cognitive decline. Amyloid-beta is viewed as pathological based on the postmortem correlation of senile plaques with an AD diagnosis. It remains uncertain which of the various forms of this peptide is the most toxic and whether Abeta or senile plaques themselves serve any desirable or protective functions. The long-term cognitive effects of chronic immunotherapy producing a steadily accumulating and effectively permanent pool of disrupted Abeta peptides within the human brain are unknown. In addition, the side effects of such therapy provided on a chronic basis could extend far beyond the brain. Eagerly seeking new therapies, critical knowledge gaps should prompt us to take a more wholistic perspective viewing Abeta and the amyloid cascade as aspects of complex and many-faceted physiological processes that sometimes end in AD dementia.",M1
19346295,"Reduction of oxidative stress, amyloid deposition, and memory deficit by manganese superoxide dismutase overexpression in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.In Alzheimer's disease (AD), oxidative stress is present early and contributes to disease pathogenesis. We previously reported that in Tg19959 transgenic AD mice, partial deficiency of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) exacerbated amyloid pathology. We therefore asked whether MnSOD overexpression would prove beneficial against AD pathogenesis, by studying the offspring of Tg19959 mice crossed with MnSOD-overexpressing mice. At 4 mo of age, there was a 2- to 3-fold increase in MnSOD protein levels in Tg19959-MnSOD mice compared to Tg19959 littermates. Tg19959-MnSOD mice also had a 50% increase in catalase protein levels, a 50% decrease in levels of oxidized protein, and a 33% reduction in cortical <e>plaque</e> burden compared to Tg19959 littermates. Spatial memory was impaired and synaptophysin levels were decreased in Tg19959 mice compared to wild-type littermates, but memory and synaptophysin levels were restored to wild-type levels in Tg19959-MnSOD littermates. These benefits occurred without changes in sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble or formic acid-soluble Abeta pools or Abeta oligomers in Tg19959-MnSOD mice compared to Tg19959 littermates. These data demonstrate that facilitation of the mitochondrial antioxidant response improves resistance to Abeta, slows plaque formation or increases plaque degradation, and markedly attenuates the phenotype in a transgenic AD mouse model.",M1
19345673,"gamma-Secretase inhibitor reduces diet-induced atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease resulting from interactions between lipids, macrophages and arterial wall cells. The Notch signaling pathway is involved in the activation of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions. This study examined whether pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling using a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) can reduce atherosclerotic lesion formation. Notch-related molecules were significantly increased in aortas from apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. In particular, macrophages in the <e>plaques</e> showed strong expression of Notch1 and a downstream transcriptional factor, Hes-1. A GSI (LY411,575, 0.2, and 1.0mg/kg/day) or vehicle control was then administered to ApoE(-/-) mice fed Western diet for 8 weeks before measuring the expression of Notch-related molecules. Systemic administration of GSI suppressed Notch signaling in vivo and reduced total plaque areas and fatty streak content in the aortic sinus in a dose-dependent manner without serious adverse effects. The GSI also suppressed the migratory activity of macrophages and reduced the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, resulting in significantly decreased macrophage infiltration in the atherosclerotic plaques. These results provided new insight into the anti-atherogenic properties of GSI in Apo E(-/-) mice fed Western diet.",M1
19339712,"Effect of APOE genotype on amyloid <e>plaque</e> load and gray matter volume in Alzheimer disease.OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of the APOE genotype on levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque load and atrophy in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) in vivo. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with moderate AD were divided into carriers and noncarriers of the epsilon4 allele. These groups were matched for age, disease duration, education, and cognitive impairment. In all subjects, [11C]PIB-PET was performed for measurement of cerebral Abeta plaque deposition and cranial MRI for the assessment of gray matter volume by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and for correction of partial volume effects (PVE) in the PET data. Voxel-based comparisons (SPM5) were performed between patient groups and healthy control populations and completed with multiple regression analyses between imaging data and epsilon4 allele frequency. RESULTS: Compared to controls, AD-typical patterns of [11C]PIB retention and atrophy were detected in both epsilon4-positive and epsilon4-negative patient groups. In direct comparison, significantly stronger and more extended [11C]PIB uptake was found in epsilon4-positive patients in bilateral temporoparietal and frontal cortex, surviving PVE correction. VBM analysis demonstrated comparable levels of atrophy in both patient groups. Regression analyses revealed a linear association between higher epsilon4 allele frequency and stronger temporoparietal Abeta plaque deposition, independently of other confounds. No major correlation between epsilon4 allele frequency and gray matter decrease was observed. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the epsilon4-positive APOE genotype not only represents a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), but also results in higher levels of Abeta plaque deposition in epsilon4-positive patients with AD compared to age-matched epsilon4-negative patients with similar levels of cognitive impairment and brain atrophy. The potential role of Abeta plaque imaging for patient inclusion and follow-up in anti-amyloid therapy trials is strengthened by these findings.",M1
19306098,"Variations in the neuropathology of familial Alzheimer's disease.Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes cause autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). PSEN1 and PSEN2 are essential components of the gamma-secretase complex, which cleaves APP to affect Abeta processing. Disruptions in Abeta processing have been hypothesised to be the major cause of AD (the amyloid cascade hypothesis). These genetic cases exhibit all the classic hallmark pathologies of AD including neuritic <e>plaques</e>, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), tissue atrophy, neuronal loss and inflammation, often in significantly enhanced quantities. In particular, these cases have average greater hippocampal atrophy and NFT, more significant cortical Abeta42 plaque deposition and more substantial inflammation. Enhanced cerebral Abeta40 angiopathy is a feature of many cases, but particularly those with APP mutations where it can be the dominant pathology. Additional frontotemporal neuronal loss in association with increased tau pathology appears unique to PSEN mutations, with mutations in exons 8 and 9 having enlarged cotton wool plaques throughout their cortex. The mechanisms driving these pathological differences in AD are discussed.",M1
19303433,"Organoselenium (Sel-Plex diet) decreases amyloid burden and RNA and DNA oxidative damage in APP/PS1 mice.To evaluate potential antioxidant characteristics of organic selenium (Se), double knock-in transgenic mice expressing human mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and human presenilin-1 (PS1) were provided a Se-deficient diet, a Se-enriched diet (Sel-Plex), or a control diet from 4 to 9 months of age followed by a control diet until 12 months of age. Levels of DNA, RNA, and protein oxidation as well as lipid peroxidation markers were determined in all mice and amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) <e>plaques</e> were quantified. APP/PS1 mice provided Sel-Plex showed significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower levels of Abeta plaque deposition and significantly decreased levels of DNA and RNA oxidation. Sel-Plex-treated mice showed no significant differences in levels of lipid peroxidation or protein oxidation compared to APP/PS1 mice on a control diet. To determine if diminished oxidative damage was associated with increased antioxidant enzyme activities, brain glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione reductase, and glutathione transferase activities were measured. Sel-Plex-treated mice showed a modest but significant increase in GSH-Px activity compared to mice on a normal diet (P&lt;0.5). Overall, these data suggest that organic Se can reduce Abeta burden and minimize DNA and RNA oxidation and support a role for it as a potential therapeutic agent in neurologic disorders with increased oxidative stress.",M1
19293239,"Clinical field-strength MRI of amyloid <e>plaques</e> induced by low-level cholesterol feeding in rabbits.Two significant barriers have limited the development of effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease. First, for many cases the aetiology is unknown and likely multi-factorial. Among these factors, hypercholesterolemia is a known risk predictor and has been linked to the formation of beta-amyloid plaques, a pathological hallmark this disease. Second, standardized diagnostic tools are unable to definitively diagnose this disease prior to death; hence new diagnostic tools are urgently needed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using high field-strength scanners has shown promise for direct visualization of beta-amyloid plaques, allowing in vivo longitudinal tracking of disease progression in mouse models. Here, we present a new rabbit model for studying the relationship between cholesterol and Alzheimer's disease development and new tools for direct visualization of beta-amyloid plaques using clinical field-strength MRI. New Zealand white rabbits were fed either a low-level (0.125-0.25% w/w) cholesterol diet (n = 5) or normal chow (n = 4) for 27 months. High-resolution (66 x 66 x 100 microm(3); scan time = 96 min) ex vivo MRI of brains was performed using a 3-Tesla (T) MR scanner interfaced with customized gradient and radiofrequency coils. Beta-amyloid-42 immunostaining and Prussian blue iron staining were performed on brain sections and MR and histological images were manually registered. MRI revealed distinct signal voids throughout the brains of cholesterol-fed rabbits, whereas minimal voids were seen in control rabbit brains. These voids corresponded directly to small clusters of extracellular beta-amyloid-positive plaques, which were consistently identified as iron-loaded (the presumed source of MR contrast). Plaques were typically located in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, striatum, hypothalamus and thalamus. Quantitative analysis of the number of histologically positive beta-amyloid plaques (P &lt; 0.0001) and MR-positive signal voids (P &lt; 0.05) found in cholesterol-fed and control rabbit brains corroborated our qualitative observations. In conclusion, long-term, low-level cholesterol feeding was sufficient to promote the formation of extracellular beta-amyloid plaque formation in rabbits, supporting the integral role of cholesterol in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease. We also present the first evidence that MRI is capable of detecting iron-associated beta-amyloid plaques in a rabbit model of Alzheimer's disease and have advanced the sensitivity of MRI for plaque detection to a new level, allowing clinical field-strength scanners to be employed. We believe extension of these technologies to an in vivo setting in rabbits is feasible and that our results support future work exploring the role of MRI as a leading imaging tool for this debilitating and life-threatening disease.",M1
19273758,"Cerebrospinal fluid {beta}-amyloid 42 and tau proteins as biomarkers of Alzheimer-type pathologic changes in the brain.BACKGROUND: There is a clear need to develop an objective diagnostic test for Alzheimer disease (AD). Changes in the levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau protein and beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42) peptide in patients with AD have been well documented, but the relationship between these biomarkers and neuropathologic changes in the brain is not established. OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between antemortem CSF biomarker levels and Alzheimer-type neuropathologic changes in the brain. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study to correlate levels of CSF Abeta42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau protein with neuropathologic changes in the brain. SETTING: Academic research. Patients The study included 123 patients (79 with clinically diagnosed AD, 29 with other dementia, and 15 with other neurologic disease). All underwent clinical evaluation and provided antemortem lumbar CSF samples, and neuropathologic data were collected from September 11, 1990, to March 13, 2003, in the Department of Neuroscience and Neurology, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Levels of CSF Abeta42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau protein were measured using standard commercial immunoassays. Neuropathologic evaluations included the classic silver impregnation method and immunohistochemistry for Abeta, hyperphosphorylated tau, and alpha-synuclein. RESULTS: Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 and tau protein levels were related to amyloid load and the presence of neurofibrillary pathologic abnormalities in the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 level correlated inversely with total Abeta load in the brain, and CSF tau level correlated with results of immunohistochemistry for hyperphosphorylated tau and with the presence of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of neuritic <e>plaques</e> in the brain remained a significant predictor of decreased CSF Abeta42 level and of increased CSF tau level. Based on the ratio of phosphorylated tau level to Abeta42 level, sensitivity was 91.6%, and specificity was 85.7%, with an overall accuracy of 90.2% for the presence of pathologic neuritic plaque in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 and tau proteins are biomarkers of AD-associated pathologic changes in the brain. The combination of abnormally low CSF Abeta42 level and abnormally high CSF tau level predicted the presence of AD pathologic features with high accuracy. This combination assay may be helpful in diagnosing the presence of AD pathologic changes in the brain.",M1
19259208,"Optical visualization of Alzheimer's pathology via multiphoton-excited intrinsic fluorescence and second harmonic generation.Intrinsic optical emissions, such as autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG), are potentially useful for functional fluorescence imaging and biomedical disease diagnosis for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).

We observed autofluorescence and SHG at senile <e>plaques</e> as well as characterized their emission spectra. The utility of intrinsic emissions was demonstrated by imaging senile plaque autofluorescence in conjunction with SHG from microtubule arrays to assess the polarity of microtubules near pathological lesions. Our results suggest that tissues from AD transgenic models contain distinct intrinsic emissions, which can provide valuable information about the disease mechanisms.",M1
19258010,"A novel approach to the identification and quantitative elemental analysis of amyloid deposits--insights into the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.There is considerable interest in the role of metals such as iron, copper, and zinc in amyloid <e>plaque</e> formation in Alzheimer's disease. However to convincingly establish their presence in plaques in vivo, a sensitive technique is required that is both quantitatively accurate and avoids isolation of plaques or staining/fixing brain tissue, since these processes introduce contaminants and redistribute elements within the tissue. Combining the three ion beam techniques of scanning transmission ion microscopy, Rutherford back scattering spectrometry and particle induced X-ray emission in conjunction with a high energy (MeV) proton microprobe we have imaged plaques in freeze-dried unstained brain sections from CRND-8 mice, and simultaneously quantified iron, copper, and zinc.

19253386,"Comparison of amyloid <e>plaque</e> contrast generated by T2-weighted, T2*-weighted, and susceptibility-weighted imaging methods in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.One of the hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is amyloid plaque deposition. Plaques appear hypointense on T(2)-weighted and T(2)*-weighted MR images probably due to the presence of endogenous iron, but no quantitative comparison of various imaging techniques has been reported. We estimated the T(1), T(2), T(2)*, and proton density values of cortical plaques and normal cortical tissue and analyzed the plaque contrast generated by a collection of T(2)-weighted, T(2)*-weighted, and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) methods in ex vivo transgenic mouse specimens. The proton density and T(1) values were similar for both cortical plaques and normal cortical tissue. The T(2) and T(2)* values were similar in cortical plaques, which indicates that the iron content of cortical plaques may not be as large as previously thought. Ex vivo plaque contrast was increased compared to a previously reported spin-echo sequence by summing multiple echoes and by performing SWI; however, gradient echo and SWI were found to be impractical for in vivo imaging due to susceptibility interface-related signal loss in the cortex.",M1
19239474,"CHF5074, a novel gamma-secretase modulator, attenuates brain beta-amyloid pathology and learning deficit in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We evaluated the effects of 1-(3',4'-dichloro-2-fluoro[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (CHF5074), a new gamma-secretase modulator, on brain beta-amyloid pathology and spatial memory in transgenic mice expressing the Swedish and London mutations of human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Sixty 6-month-old hAPP mice were treated for 6 months with CHF5074 or ibuprofen (375 ppm in the diet) or standard diet. Twenty-one wild-type mice received standard diet. KEY RESULTS: Compared with transgenic controls, CHF5074 treatment significantly reduced the area occupied by <e>plaques</e> in cortex (P = 0.003) and hippocampus (P = 0.004). The number of plaques were also reduced by CHF5074 in both cortex (P = 0.022) and hippocampus (P = 0.005). Plaque-associated microglia in CHF5074-treated animals was lower than in transgenic controls in cortex (P = 0.008) and hippocampus (P = 0.002). Ibuprofen treatment significantly reduced microglia area in cortex and hippocampus but not beta-amyloid burden. On the last day of the Morris water maze, transgenic controls performed significantly worse than the non-transgenic animals and the CHF5074-treated transgenic mice, on the swimming path to reach the hidden platform. Ibuprofen-treated animals did not perform significantly better than transgenic controls. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Chronic CHF5074 treatment reduced brain beta-amyloid burden, associated microglia inflammation and attenuated spatial memory deficit in hAPP mice. This novel gamma-secretase modulator is a promising therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease.",M1
19228952,"Neprilysin overexpression inhibits <e>plaque</e> formation but fails to reduce pathogenic Abeta oligomers and associated cognitive deficits in human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice.The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may arise from an imbalance between Abeta production and clearance. Overexpression of the Abeta-degrading enzyme neprilysin in brains of human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice decreases overall Abeta levels and amyloid plaque burdens. Because AD-related synaptic and cognitive deficits appear to be more closely related to Abeta oligomers than to plaques, it is important to determine whether increased neprilysin activity also diminishes the levels of pathogenic Abeta oligomers and related neuronal deficits in vivo. To address this question, we crossed hAPP transgenic mice with neprilysin transgenic mice and analyzed their offspring. Neprilysin overexpression reduced soluble Abeta levels by 50% and effectively prevented early Abeta deposition in the neocortex and hippocampus. However, it did not reduce levels of Abeta trimers and Abeta*56 or improve deficits in spatial learning and memory. The differential effect of neprilysin on plaques and oligomers suggests that neprilysin-dependent degradation of Abeta affects plaques more than oligomers and that these structures may form through distinct assembly mechanisms. Neprilysin's inability to prevent learning and memory deficits in hAPP mice may be related to its inability to reduce pathogenic Abeta oligomers. Reduction of Abeta oligomers will likely be required for anti-Abeta treatments to improve cognitive functions.",M1
19228947,"Oligomeric amyloid beta associates with postsynaptic densities and correlates with excitatory synapse loss near senile <e>plaques</e>.Synapse loss correlates with a cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but whether this is caused by fibrillar deposits known as senile plaques or soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid beta (Abeta) is controversial. By using array tomography, a technique that combines ultrathin sectioning of tissue with immunofluorescence, allowing precise quantification of small structures, such as synapses, we have tested the hypothesis that oligomeric Abeta surrounding plaques contributes to synapse loss in a mouse model of AD. We find that senile plaques are surrounded by a halo of oligomeric Abeta. Analysis of &gt;14,000 synapses (represented by PSD95-stained excitatory synapses) shows that there is a 60% loss of excitatory synapses in the halo of oligomeric Abeta surrounding plaques and that the density increases to reach almost control levels in volumes further than 50 microm from a plaque in an approximately linear fashion (linear regression, r(2) = 0.9; P &lt; 0.0001). Further, in transgenic cortex, microdeposits of oligomeric Abeta associate with a subset of excitatory synapses, which are significantly smaller than those not in contact with oligomeric Abeta. The proportion of excitatory synapses associated with Abeta correlates with decreasing density (correlation, -0.588; P &lt; 0.0001). These data show that senile plaques are a potential reservoir of oligomeric Abeta, which colocalizes with the postsynaptic density and is associated with spine collapse, reconciling the apparently competing schools of thought of  plaque  vs.  oligomeric Abeta  as the synaptotoxic species in the brain of AD patients.",M1
19228583,"Less Alzheimer disease neuropathology in medicated hypertensive than nonhypertensive persons.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that use of antihypertensive medication is associated with lower Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology. METHODS: This was a postmortem study of 291 brains limited to those with normal neuropathology or with uncomplicated AD neuropathology (i.e., without other dementia-associated neuropathology) in persons with or without hypertension (HTN) who were and were not treated with antihypertensive medications. Neuritic <e>plaque</e> (NP) and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) densities, quantified in selected brain regions according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropathologic criteria, with additional cortical NP counts, yielded 24 neuropathologic regional measures or summaries. Medicated hypertension (HTN-med; n = 77), nonmedicated HTN (HTN-nomed; n = 42), and non-HTN (no-HTN; n = 172) groups were compared by analyses of variance. RESULTS: The HTN-med group had significantly less neuropathology than the no-HTN group. The no-HTN group averaged over 50% higher mean NP and NFT ratings, and double the mean NP count, of the HTN-med group. The HTN-nomed group had significantly more neuropathology than the HTN-med group, but not significantly less than the no-HTN group. CONCLUSIONS: There was substantially less Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology in the medicated hypertension group than the nonhypertensive group, which may reflect a salutary effect of antihypertensive medication against AD-associated neuropathology.",M1
19225804,"Three-dimensional colocalization analysis of plasma-derived apolipoprotein B with amyloid <e>plaques</e> in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.Parenchymal accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) is a hallmark pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease. An emerging hypothesis is that blood-to-brain delivery of A beta may increase with compromised blood-brain barrier integrity. In plasma, substantial A beta is associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) secreted by the liver and intestine. Utilizing apolipoprotein B as an exclusive marker of hepatic and intestinal TRLs, here we show utilizing an highly sensitive 3-dimensional immuno-microscopy imaging technique, that in APP/PS1 amyloid transgenic mice, concomitant with substantially increased plasma A beta, there is a significant colocalization of apolipoprotein B with cerebral amyloid plaque. The findings are consistent with the possibility that circulating lipoprotein-A beta contributes to cerebral amyloidosis.",M1
19219917,"Age effects on the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis by physical activity and environmental enrichment in the APP23 mouse model of Alzheimer disease.An active lifestyle is to some degree protective against Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the biological basis for this benefit is still far from clear. We hypothesize that physical and cognitive activity increase a reserve for plasticity by increasing adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). We thus assessed how age affects the response to activity in the murine APP23 model of AD compared with wild type (WT) controls and studied the effects of physical exercise (RUN) and environmental enrichment (ENR) in comparison with standard housing (CTR) at two different ages (6 months and 18 months) and in both genotypes. At 18 months, both activity paradigms reduced the hippocampal human Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio when compared with CTR, despite a stable <e>plaque</e> load in the hippocampus. At this age, both RUN and ENR increased the number of newborn granule cells in the DG of APP23 mice when compared with CTR, whereas the levels of regulation were equivalent to those in WT mice under the same housing conditions. At 6 months, however, neurogenesis in ENR but not RUN mice responded like the WT. Quantifying the number of cells at the doublecortin-positive stage in relation to the number of cells on postmitotic stages we found that ENR overproportionally increased the number of the DCX-positive  late  progenitor cells, indicative of an increased potential to recruit even more new neurons. In summary, the biological substrates for activity-dependent regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis were preserved in the APP23 mice. We thus propose that in this model, ENR even more than RUN might contribute to a  neurogenic reserve  despite a stable plaque load and that age affects the outcome of an interaction based on  activity.

We herein describe the synthesis of (18)F-labeled benzylideneaniline derivatives using a novel labeling approach for imaging Abeta plaques in AD patients. METHODS: Benzylidenaniline derivatives were synthesized by reacting fluorobenzaldehyde and corresponding aniline derivatives. Fluorobenzaldehyde was labeled with (18)F by incubating [(18)F]fluoride with N,N,N-trimethylbenzaldehyde in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bicarbonate. In vitro binding assay, stability test and biodistribution study were performed. RESULTS: These compounds were stable at alkaline pH (pH &gt;9); however, they were hydrolyzed rapidly at physiological pH (pH approximately 7.4). The K(i) values of amine-containing benzylideneaniline derivatives for Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) aggregates were 26-78 nM. These (18)F-labeled benzylideneaniline derivatives showed high brain uptake and rapid clearance after intravenous administration in normal mice (1.8-3.1%ID/g at 2 min and 0.1-1.2%ID/g at 30 min). The low level of bone activity at 30 min indicated that these (18)F-labeled benzylideneanilines are not prone to defluorination. Furthermore, the compounds have suitable lipophilicity - a property required to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. CONCLUSION: These results showed that the instability of these compounds could cause a higher early phase/late phase ratio due to rapid clearance in the normal brain. The findings from this study suggest that these (18)F-labeled benzylideneaniline derivatives are feasible for the imaging of Abeta plaques.",M1
19216563,"Synthesis and evaluation of 18F-labeled 2-phenylbenzothiazoles as positron emission tomography imaging agents for amyloid <e>plaques</e> in Alzheimer's disease.Imaging agents targeting amyloid beta (Abeta) may be useful for early diagnosis and follow-up of treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three of five tested 2-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-benzothiazoles displayed high binding affinities for Abeta plaques in AD human brain homogenates (K(i) between 2.2 and 22.5 nM). They all contained the (18)F-label directly attached to the aromatic ring and were synthesized starting from the nitro precursor. Determination of the partition coefficient, biodistribution studies in normal mice, and in vivo microPET studies in normal rats showed that their initial brain uptake was high and brain washout was fast. The most promising compound [(18)F]5, or 6-methyl-2-(4'-[(18)F]fluorophenyl)-1,3-benzothiazole, seemed to be metabolically stable in the brain, and its plasma radiometabolites, which do not cross the blood-brain barrier, were determined. The preliminary results strongly suggest that this new fluorinated compound is a promising candidate as an Abeta plaque imaging agent for the study of patients with AD.",M1
19215301,"Amyloid-beta protofibril levels correlate with spatial learning in Arctic Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice.Oligomeric assemblies of amyloid-beta (Abeta) are suggested to be central in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease because levels of soluble Abeta correlate much better with the extent of cognitive dysfunctions than do senile <e>plaque</e> counts. Moreover, such Abeta species have been shown to be neurotoxic, to interfere with learned behavior and to inhibit the maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation. The tg-ArcSwe model (i.e. transgenic mice with the Arctic and Swedish Alzheimer mutations) expresses elevated levels of Abeta protofibrils in the brain, making tg-ArcSwe a highly suitable model for investigating the pathogenic role of these Abeta assemblies. In the present study, we estimated Abeta protofibril levels in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of tg-ArcSwe mice, and also assessed their role with respect to cognitive functions. Protofibril levels, specifically measured with a sandwich ELISA, were found to be elevated in young tg-ArcSwe mice compared to several transgenic models lacking the Arctic mutation. In aged tg-ArcSwe mice with considerable plaque deposition, Abeta protofibrils were approximately 50% higher than in younger mice, whereas levels of total Abeta were exponentially increased. Young tg-ArcSwe mice showed deficits in spatial learning, and individual performances in the Morris water maze were correlated inversely with levels of Abeta protofibrils, but not with total Abeta levels. We conclude that Abeta protofibrils accumulate in an age-dependent manner in tg-ArcSwe mice, although to a far lesser extent than total Abeta. Our findings suggest that increased levels of Abeta protofibrils could result in spatial learning impairment.",M1

Synthetic triterpenoids have been found to facilitate antioxidant response and reduce inflammation in several models. We investigated the effect of the triterpenoid, 2-Cyano-3,12-Dioxooleana-1,9-Dien-28-Oic acid-MethylAmide (CDDO-MA) in Tg19959 mice, which carry the human amyloid precursor protein with two mutations. These mice develop memory impairments and amyloid plaques as early as 2-3 months of age. CDDO-MA was provided with chow (800 mg/kg) from 1 to 4 months of age.

Here, we investigate whether naturally occurring autoantibodies to beta-amyloid contribute to beta-amyloid plaque removal in nonimmunized AD patients. METHODS: We generated an AD tissue microarray with 2,325 tissue specimens from 3 defined central nervous system regions of 48 AD patients and 48 age-matched control patients. Absolute quantification of beta-amyloid, beta-amyloid plaque-bound IgG, and phagocytic, resting, and activated microglia and microhemorrhages was done using a standardized, highly reproducible scoring system. RESULTS: The majority of neuritic plaques are decorated by IgG. AD patients with prominently IgG-labeled neuritic plaques have a significantly reduced plaque burden and an increase in phagocytic microglia, yet no increase in microhemorrhages.

Understanding why these individuals show no cognitive decline, despite high AD pathologic burdens, may be key to discovery of neuroprotective mechanisms. METHODS: A total of 36 subjects who on autopsy had Braak stage V or VI and moderate or frequent neuritic <e>plaque</e> scores based on Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) standards were included. Twelve had normal cognitive function and 24 a diagnosis of AD before death. Demographic characteristics, clinical and pathologic data, as well as antemortem brain volumes were compared between the groups. RESULTS: In multiple regression analysis, antemortem hippocampal and total brain volumes were significantly larger in the group with normal cognitive function after adjusting for gender, age at MRI, time from MRI to death, Braak stage, CERAD neuritic plaque score, and overall presence of vascular disease. CONCLUSION: Larger brain and hippocampal volumes were associated with preserved cognitive function during life despite a high burden of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologic lesions at death. A better understanding of processes that lead to preservation of brain volume may provide important clues for the discovery of mechanisms that protect the elderly from AD.",M1
19154776,"Cryptotanshinone, a compound from Salvia miltiorrhiza modulates amyloid precursor protein metabolism and attenuates beta-amyloid deposition through upregulating alpha-secretase in vivo and in vitro.The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved enzymatically by non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways. alpha-Secretase cleaves APP within beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) sequence, resulting in the release of a secreted fragment of APP (sAPPalpha) and precluding Abeta generation. Cryptotanshinone (CTS), an active component of the medicinal herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been shown to improve learning and memory in several pharmacological models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effects of CTS on the Abeta <e>plaque</e> pathology and the APP processing in AD are unclear. Here we reported that CTS strongly attenuated amyloid plaque deposition in the brain of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. In addition, CTS significantly improved spatial learning and memory in APP/PS1 mice assessed by the Morris water maze testing. To define the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of CTS, we investigated the effects of the CTS on APP processing in rat cortical neuronal cells overexpressing Swedish mutant human APP695. CTS was found to decrease Abeta generation in concentration-dependent (0-10muM) manner. Interestingly, the N-terminal APP cleavage product, sAPPalpha was markedly increased by CTS. Further study showed that alpha-secretase activity was increased by CTS. Taken together, our results suggested CTS improved the cognitive ability in AD transgenic mice and promoted APP metabolism toward the non-amyloidogenic products pathway in rat cortical neuronal cells. CTS shows a promising novel way for the therapy of AD.",M1
19141073,"AZD2184: a radioligand for sensitive detection of beta-amyloid deposits.The presence of beta-amyloid <e>plaques</e> in brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and serves as a biomarker for confirmation of diagnosis postmortem. Positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands such as Pittsburgh compound B ([(11)C]-2-(3-fluoro-4-methylamino-phenyl)-benzothiazol-6-ol) (PIB) binds selectively to beta-amyloid and are promising new tools supporting the clinical diagnoses of AD. In addition, such methodology may be useful for evaluation of new drugs aiming at reduction of amyloid plaque load. The objective of this study is to develop a new amyloid selective PET radioligand with higher signal-to-background ratio when compared with existing amyloid PET ligands. The lead compound, AZD2184, (2-[6-(methylamino)pyridin-3-yl]-1,3-benzothiazol-6-ol) was found to have high affinity for amyloid fibrils in vitro (K(d): 8.4 +/- 1.0 nM). Two minutes after i.v. administration in rats, about 1% of the dose was in brain. In vitro autoradiography on cortical brain sections from amyloid-beta precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice and AD patients showed that while [(3)H]AZD2184 and [(3)H]PIB are mutually displaceable, [(3)H]AZD2184 displays a higher signal-to-background ratio primarily by virtue of lower background binding levels. The ratio of binding ability in prefrontal cortex (high plaque load) to subcortical white matter (background) was 4.5 for [(3)H]AZD2184 and 0.8 for [(3)H]PIB at 1 nM. In adjacent cortical sections from APP/PS1 mouse as well as from AD cortical tissue, [(3)H]AZD2184 and antibodies to human beta-amyloid labeled identical structures. In vivo administration of [(3)H]AZD2184 to APP/PS1 mice further showed that [(3)H]AZD2184 labels amyloid deposits with low non-specific background binding. Taken together, the pre-clinical profile of AZD2184 in relation to the reference ligand PIB, suggests that (11)C-labeled AZD2184 is a potential radioligand for PET-visualization of beta-amyloid deposits in the living human brain.",M1
19124691,"Influence of cognitive status, age, and APOE-4 genetic risk on brain FDDNP positron-emission tomography imaging in persons without dementia.CONTEXT: Amyloid senile <e>plaques</e> and tau neurofibrillary tangles are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease that accumulate in the brains of people without dementia years before they develop dementia. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans after intravenous injections of 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP), which binds to plaques and tangles in vitro, demonstrate increased cerebral binding in patients with Alzheimer disease compared with cognitively intact controls. Here we investigated whether known risk factors for Alzheimer disease and dementia are associated with FDDNP-PET binding. OBJECTIVE: To determine if impaired cognitive status, older age, apolipoprotein E-4 (APOE-4) genetic risk for Alzheimer disease, family history of dementia, and less education are associated with increased regional cerebral FDDNP-PET binding. DESIGN: Cross-sectional clinical study. SETTING: A university research institute. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer sample of 76 middle-aged and older persons without dementia (mean age, 67 years) including 36 with mild cognitive impairment. Of the 72 subjects with genetic data, 34 were APOE-4 carriers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The FDDNP-PET signal in brain regions of interest, including medial and lateral temporal, posterior cingulate, parietal, and frontal. RESULTS: For all regions studied, cognitive status was associated with increased FDDNP binding (P &lt; .02 to .005). Older age was associated with increased lateral temporal FDDNP binding. Carriers of APOE-4 demonstrated higher frontal FDDNP binding than noncarriers. In the mild cognitive impairment group, age was associated with increased medial and lateral temporal FDDNP binding, and APOE-4 carriers had higher medial temporal binding than noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired cognitive status, older age, and APOE-4 carrier status are associated with increased brain FDDNP-PET binding in persons without dementia, consistent with previous clinical and postmortem studies associating these risk factors with amyloid plaque and tau tangle accumulation. Stratifying subject groups according to APOE-4 carrier status, age, and cognitive status may therefore be an informative strategy in future clinical trials using FDDNP-PET.",M1
19109907,"Phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha increases BACE1 levels and promotes amyloidogenesis.beta-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), the rate-limiting enzyme for beta-amyloid (Abeta) production, is elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we show that energy deprivation induces phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha (eIF2alpha-P), which increases the translation of BACE1. Salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2alpha-P phosphatase PP1c, directly increases BACE1 and elevates Abeta production in primary neurons. Preventing eIF2alpha phosphorylation by transfection with constitutively active PP1c regulatory subunit, dominant-negative eIF2alpha kinase PERK, or PERK inhibitor P58(IPK) blocks the energy-deprivation-induced BACE1 increase. Furthermore, chronic treatment of aged Tg2576 mice with energy inhibitors increases levels of eIF2alpha-P, BACE1, Abeta, and amyloid <e>plaques</e>. Importantly, eIF2alpha-P and BACE1 are elevated in aggressive plaque-forming 5XFAD transgenic mice, and BACE1, eIF2alpha-P, and amyloid load are correlated in humans with AD. These results strongly suggest that eIF2alpha phosphorylation increases BACE1 levels and causes Abeta overproduction, which could be an early, initiating molecular mechanism in sporadic AD.",M1

In binding experiments in vitro, aurone derivatives showed very good affinity for Abeta aggregates (K(i) = 1.1 to 3.4 nM). No-carrier-added radioiodinated aurones were successfully prepared through an iododestannylation reaction from the corresponding tributyltin derivatives. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, aurone derivatives displayed high brain uptake (1.7-4.5% ID/g at 2 min) and rapid clearance from the brain (0.1-0.4% ID/g at 30 min), especially [125I]15. Furthermore, a specific plaque labeling signal was observed in in vitro autoradiography of postmortem AD brain sections using [125I]15. [125I]15 may be a useful SPECT imaging agent for detecting Abeta plaques in the brain of AD.",M1
19067370,"Detection of isolated cerebrovascular beta-amyloid with Pittsburgh compound B.Imaging of cerebrovascular beta-amyloid (cerebral amyloid angiopathy) is complicated by the nearly universal overlap of this pathology with Alzheimer's pathology.

The results demonstrated increased Pittsburgh Compound B retention selectively in occipital cortex, sparing regions typically labeled in Alzheimer's disease.

19059977,"Severely dystrophic axons at amyloid <e>plaques</e> remain continuous and connected to viable cell bodies.Synapse loss precedes cell death in Alzheimer's disease, but the timing of axon degeneration relative to these events, and the causal relationships remain unclear. Axons become so severely dystrophic near amyloid plaques that their interruption, causing permanent loss of function, extensive synapse loss, and potentially cell death appears imminent. However, it remains unclear whether axons are truly interrupted at plaques and whether cell bodies fail to support their axons and dendrites. We traced TgCRND8 mouse axons longitudinally through, distal to, and proximal from dystrophic regions. The corresponding neurons not only survived but remained morphologically unaltered, indicating absence of axonal damage signalling or a failure to respond to it. Axons, no matter how dystrophic, remained continuous and initially morphologically normal outside the plaque region, reflecting support by metabolically active cell bodies and continued axonal transport. Immunochemical and ultrastructural studies showed dystrophic axons were tightly associated with disruption of presynaptic transmission machinery, suggesting local functional impairment. Thus, we rule out long-range degeneration axons or dendrites as major contributors to early synapse loss in this model, raising the prospect of a therapeutic window for functional rescue of individual neurons lasting months or even years after their axons become highly dystrophic. We propose that multi-focal pathology has an important role in the human disease in bringing about the switch from local, and potentially recoverable, synapse loss into permanent loss of neuronal processes and eventually their cell bodies.",M1
19048607,"Centella asiatica extract selectively decreases amyloid beta levels in hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease animal model.PSAPP mice expressing the 'Swedish' amyloid precursor protein and the M146L presenilin 1 mutations are a well-characterized model for spontaneous amyloid beta <e>plaque</e> formation. Centella asiatica has a long history of use in India as a memory enhancing drug in Ayurvedic literature. The study investigated whether Centella asiatica extract (CaE) can alter the amyloid pathology in PSAPP mice by administering CaE (2.5 or 5.0 g/kg/day) starting at 2 months of age prior to the onset of detectable amyloid deposition and continued for either 2 months or 8 months. A significant decrease in amyloid beta 1-40 and 1-42 was detectable by ELISA following an 8 month treatment with 2.5 mg/kg of CaE. A reduction in Congo Red stained fibrillar amyloid plaques was detected with the 5.0 mg/kg CaE dose and long-term treatment regimen. It was also confirmed that CaE functions as an antioxidant in vitro, scavenging free radicals, reducing lipid peroxidation and protecting against DNA damage. The data indicate that CaE can impact the amyloid cascade altering amyloid beta pathology in the brains of PSAPP mice and modulating components of the oxidative stress response that has been implicated in the neurodegenerative changes that occur with Alzheimer's disease.",M1
19041676,"Dietary supplementation with resveratrol reduces <e>plaque</e> pathology in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease.Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in red wine, peanuts, soy beans, and pomegranates, possesses a wide range of biological effects. Since resveratrol's properties seem ideal for treating neurodegenerative diseases, its ability to diminish amyloid plaques was tested. Mice were fed clinically feasible dosages of resveratrol for forty-five days. Neither resveratrol nor its conjugated metabolites were detectable in brain. Nevertheless, resveratrol diminished plaque formation in a region specific manner. The largest reductions in the percent area occupied by plaques were observed in medial cortex (-48%), striatum (-89%) and hypothalamus (-90%). The changes occurred without detectable activation of SIRT-1 or alterations in APP processing. However, brain glutathione declined 21% and brain cysteine increased 54%. The increased cysteine and decreased glutathione may be linked to the diminished plaque formation. This study supports the concept that onset of neurodegenerative disease may be delayed or mitigated with use of dietary chemo-preventive agents that protect against beta-amyloid plaque formation and oxidative stress.",M1
20527507,"Regional differences within the dentition for <e>plaque</e>, gingivitis, and anaerobic bacteria.OBJECTIVE: This investigation assessed regional differences in dental plaque and gingivitis within the human dentition in conjunction with microbiological analyses of dental plaque. METHODS: Forty-one adults (23 males and 18 females; age range 19-44 years) were enrolled, and a calibrated dental examiner completed whole mouth examinations for dental plaque (PI) and gingivitis (GI) using the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein Index (TMQH) and the L6e-Silness (LS) Index, respectively. Dental plaque samples were collected from the anterior surfaces and posterior teeth to determine viable anaerobic bacteria. During this visit, subjects underwent a whole mouth dental prophylaxis and were provided a marketed fluoride dentifrice for twice-daily oral hygiene. Subjects were recalled on day 15 and day 30 for whole mouth assessments of PI and GI, followed by the collection of dental plaque from the anterior and posterior teeth for microbiological analyses during these visits. RESULTS: Low plaque and gingival scores were common on anterior surfaces, in contrast to greater frequencies of higher PI and GI scores on the posterior regions or the entire dentition. Correspondingly, mean scores for PI and GI were significantly lower among the anterior surfaces in comparison to all other regions of the mouth (posterior, Ramfjord surfaces, or the entire dentition) over each phase of the study (p &lt; 0.0001). While prophylaxis resulted in lower clinical scores from baseline to the day-15 recall visit (p &lt; 0.05), anterior surfaces demonstrated lower scores than posterior regions during this recall visit (p &lt; 0.05). Although dental plaque scores increased from the day-15 to the day-30 evaluations, gingival scores maintained broad reductions, with anterior scores consistently lower than the corresponding posterior regions (p &lt;0.05). Microbiological analyses indicated significantly lower numbers of viable bacteria from the anterior surfaces in comparison to posterior regions at both recall visits (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Anterior surfaces routinely demonstrated lower levels of dental plaque scores than the other regions of the dentition. Higher gingival inflammation levels were also correlated with increased plaque deposits associated with posterior teeth. Microbiological analyses confirm clinical observations with significantly higher numbers of viable bacteria in the dental plaque collected from the posterior regions. The human dentition demonstrates significant regional differences in the prevalence of dental plaque, gingivitis, and corresponding anaerobic bacteria, with posterior surfaces consistently reporting higher scores than the anterior regions. These consistent differences should be taken into account in performing plaque and gingivitis studies when assessing the efficacy of oral health products for controlling dental health.",M2
20527506,"A clinical evaluation of the <e>plaque</e> removal efficacy of five manual toothbrushes.OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the plaque removal efficacy of five different Oral-B manual toothbrushes: CrossAction Pro-Health (CAPH), CrossAction (CA), Exceed (EX), Advantage 123 (ADV 123), and Indicator (IND). METHODS: This was a single-use, five-treatment, examiner-blind, randomized, five-period (visit) crossover study, with 10 different treatment sequences (groups) that determined the order in which the five toothbrushes were assigned at study visits. Three toothbrushes had an advanced CrissCross bristle design (CAPH, CA, EX), while two had more standard designs with straight bristles (ADV 123 and IND). At the first visit, subjects disclosed their plaque with disclosing solution, and an examiner performed a baseline plaque examination using the Rustogi, et al. Modification of the Navy Plaque Index (RMNPI). Subjects brushed for one minute with their assigned toothbrush under supervision, after which they again disclosed their plaque and were given a second plaque examination. The same procedure was followed for each of the visits in turn. RESULTS: All five manual toothbrushes showed a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001) reduction in plaque from baseline for the whole mouth (84% to 93%), gingival margin (74% to 88%), and approximal surfaces (95% to 99%). For pair-wise treatment comparisons for all three plaque measures, CAPH, CA, and EX demonstrated statistically significantly better plaque removal than ADV 123 and IND (all p &lt; 0.018). No other treatment comparisons were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: All five manual toothbrushes showed highly effective plaque reduction for whole mouth, gingival margin, and approximal surfaces. Comparisons between brushes showed consistent advantages for CAPH, CA, and EX compared to ADV 123 and IND for all three plaque measures, indicating that advances in toothbrush design can further enhance plaque removal.",M2
20527504,"The use of the Modified Gingival Margin <e>Plaque</e> Index (MGMPI) method to investigate the inhibitory effect of various toothpastes on dental plaque formation.OBJECTIVE: Colgate Total (CTT) is the only FDA-approved toothpaste for antiplaque and antigingivitis benefits. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of Colgate Total Pharma (CTP), a new variant of Colgate Total, with Colgate Regular Toothpaste (CRT) on plaque formation over a 24-hour period following a single use of the dentifrice. METHODS: CTP and CRT were the two test products. CRT was used for a washout product as well. Fifteen male/female subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were included into this single-blind (preliminary phase) and double-blind (randomized phase) crossover study. Ethical approval and written informed consent were obtained. Preliminary phase: After a one-week washout with CRT, subjects brushed in the dental clinic with CRT before a one-minute use of a test dentifrice. A baseline Modified Gingival Margin Plaque Index (MGMPI) score was calculated. Subjects refrained from oral hygiene for 24 hours, and returned to the clinic for their 24-hour MGMPI score. Subjects entered the second washout phase to repeat as per the crossover design. The above procedures were conducted three times by three independent examiners. Randomized phase: Subjects were randomized to the groups according to a computer-generated randomization schedule. The procedure was carried out as in the preliminary phase, except the washout period between the two products was at least one week and the products (CTP or CRT) were used in a randomized double-blind manner. Plaque scores were recorded as above. RESULTS: CTP provided a significant (p = 0.01) antiplaque effect versus CRT. The results are consistent with previously reported data for CTT. All three examiners demonstrated a strong correlation for this clinical study utilizing the MGMPI methodology. CONCLUSION: This clinical investigation examined the efficacy of a new variant of a commercial dentifrice, historically shown to provide antiplaque and antigingivitis efficacy. It is important to confirm the continued efficacy of new products to consumers and to the profession. Additionally, this clinical trial demonstrated the usefulness of the clinical methodology with respect to consistency in results by three independent clinical examiners. Because this methodology is often employed to document antiplaque benefits of new and existing technologies, it is important to periodically evaluate and confirm its reliability and reproducibility.",M2

20480054,"The effects of a zinc citrate dentifrice on bacteria found on oral surfaces.PURPOSE: Clinical studies with dentifrices formulated with antimicrobial ingredients typically examine the effects of their use on clinical parameters of dental <e>plaque</e> and gingivitis. The effects of routine use of these formulations on the microorganisms found in the distinct regions of the human mouth remain unexplored. The present cross-over design clinical study compared the effects of brushing with a recently formulated dentifrice with 1% zinc citrate to a control dentifrice on oral bacteria found in oral niches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 35 adults completed a 1-week wash-out phase prior to providing baseline samples of dental plaque on the teeth, gums, saliva and scrapings from cheeks and tongue to quantify anaerobic bacteria. Subjects brushed twice daily with a randomly assigned test dentifrice for the next 13 days. On the 14th day, they arrived at the dental clinic prior to oral hygiene and provided samples similar to baseline samples for microbiological examinations. Subjects brushed with the test formulation they used in the previous 13 days, prior to providing additional samples at 5-h post-brushing for microbial assessments. An additional wash-out phase was assigned to subjects prior to completing the study with the alternate test dentifrice. RESULTS: Analyses of log10-transformed microbial counts indicated no statistical differences in the baseline samples from each oral site (P &gt; 0.05), while brushing with the zinc citrate dentifrice resulted in a significant reduction in bacteria in each post-brushing oral site versus the control paste (P &lt; 0.05). Brushing with the zinc citrate dentifrice resulted in 38.56%, 23.57%, 26.24% and 29.1% decreases in anaerobic bacteria from dental plaque, tongue, cheek and saliva, respectively, in the overnight samples collected on the 14th day versus the control. Similarly, the 5-h post-brushing samples indicated 24.8%, 34.25%, 37.98% and 38.31% reductions in anaerobic organisms when compared with control. CONCLUSIONS: Toothbrushing with the zinc citrate formulation resulted in significant reductions in oral bacteria from all of the intraoral locations.",M2
20465033,"Experimental gingivitis in male khat (Catha edulis) chewers.Whether or not khat chewing is detrimental to the periodontium remains uncertain. Findings from cross-sectional studies have been contradictory and, in most cases, uncontrolled for confounders. OBJECTIVES: to experimentally test the effect of khat chewing on formation of dental <e>plaque</e> and development of gingivitis. METHODS: This was a split-mouth, parallel-group, 20-day experimental gingivitis study involving non-smoking, young, male khat chewers (n = 8) and non-chewers (n = 9). Measurements of plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and bleeding on probing (BOP), as experimental outcomes, were performed on days 0, 10, and 20. Scores were compared between the two groups (parallel-group model) and between the khat-chewing and non-chewing sides (split-mouth model). RESULTS: All experimental outcomes significantly increased over time. Results from the two models were consistent. Khat chewing was associated with lower PI scores; however, differences were only significant at day 20. Despite scoring higher in baseline gingival inflammation, the khat chewers and khat-chewing sides showed significantly lower GI and BOP scores at days 10 and 20. The effect of khat chewing was evident on both the lingual and buccal aspects. CONCLUSIONS: The observed anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis properties indicate that khat chewing is probably not detrimental to the periodontium. The validity of previous findings supporting an opposite view is undermined by lack of control for confounders, particularly smoking.",M2

METHODS: A total of 636 children 12 years of age, whose parents granted permission, were examined from public and private schools in different geographical locations representing different socioeconomic classes in Khartoum province. The variables of this study had been collected by a single examiner using a direct interview questionnaire and clinical examination with appropriate indices. The intraexaminer reliability was (Alpha = 0.9321). RESULTS: Regular brushing in 92.3%, irregular in 6.9% and no brushing in 0.8% of all children. The frequency of brushing was 81.4% once, 16.4% twice and 1.4% more than twice a day. For all children, 93.1% used the toothbrush while 3.9% used a Miswak. Concerning the technique of brushing, 14.3% brushed vertically, 82.7% brushed horizontally and only 2% brushed in a circular way. It was found that only 5.2% used other oral hygiene means (dental floss and tooth pick) for cleaning teeth. The results showed a high correlation between oral hygiene practices of the children and both parents' education (P = 0.001) as well as gender (P = 0.001). The mean of plaque index was (0.888), gingival index was (0.686) and calculus index was (0.107). In the entire sample these indices were found to differ significantly with sex (P = 0.000), parents' education (P = 0.000) and brushing practice (P = 0.000).) CONCLUSION: It was recommended that, providing intensive advice and supervision concerning oral hygiene practices through public and school health care is mandatory. Other studies for rural and urban areas of different age groups should be done for comparisons.",M2
20429938,"Periodontal disease-associated micro-organisms in peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women using or not using hormone replacement therapy. A two-year follow-up study.BACKGROUND: Despite conflicting results on the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) there is no doubt that many women benefit from it. Women using HRT are known to be more health conscious in general with putative positive implications in the mouth. However, we observed recently in our cohort hardly any difference in oral health status between HRT-users and non-users. There are only a few studies about HRT and oral microbiota. We hypothesized that counts of periodontal micro-organisms are lower in health-conscious HRT-users than non-users. METHODS: Two-year open follow-up study was conducted on originally 200 HRT-users and 200 non-users from age cohorts of 50-58 years. After clinical examination pooled subgingival <e>plaque</e> samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analyses. The results of finally 135 women meeting the inclusion criteria were analyzed with cross-tabulation and chi-square test. Explanatory factors were studied by step-wise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In HRT group, the numbers of positive samples for Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis, p &lt; 0.07), Prevotella intermedia (P. intermedia, p &lt; 0.05)and Tannerella forsythia (T. forsythia, p &lt; 0.01) decreased in women with &gt;or= 4-mm-deep pockets. Respectively in HRT users with &gt;or= 6-mm-deep pockets the numbers of positive samples for P. gingivalis (p &lt; 0.05) and T. forsythia (p &lt; 0.01) were decreased. No corresponding differences were observed in the non-HRT group. In logistic regression, the existence of deep periodontal pockets explained the majority of cases harboring specific micro-organisms in both groups. CONCLUSION: Although use of HRT did not correlate with periodontal health status, HRT led to decreasing numbers of positive samples of the periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis and T. forsythia. Further studies with longer observation time are needed to observe the clinical relevance of the results.",M2
20427914,"Prevalence of oral Entamoeba gingivalis and Trichomonas tenax in patients with periodontal disease and healthy population in Shiraz, southern Iran.BACKGROUND: It was shown that two parasites of Entamoeba gingivalis (E. gingivalis) and Trichomonas tenax (T. tenax) may be responsible for oral parasitic infection. This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of these parasites in oral cavity of patients with periodontal disease and in healthy population in Shiraz, Southern Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 patients with periodontal disease (case group) and 50 subjects with healthy gingiva (control group) entered in the present study. A questionnaire recorded general health, smoking habits, and any history of antibiotic consumption during the last six months for each patient. In the case group, saliva was collected by sterile swab and the gingival crevicular fluid by the paper point. The <e>plaque</e> and calculi were collected by sterile curette and scaler. In the control group, saliva and gingival crevicular fluid were collected and sent to laboratory for further studies. RESULTS: In the case group, nine patients were infected, six with E. gingivalis and three with T. tenax. Seven patients had mobility of the teeth, one patient was smoker and five had previous history of antibiotic consumption. In the control group, only one subject was infected with E. gingivalis without any history of smoking and antibiotic consumption.

20415914,"Short-term clinical effects of commercially available gel containing Acacia arabica: a randomized controlled clinical trial.Background: Certain plants used in folk medicine serve as a source of therapeutic agent by having antimicrobial and other multi-potential effects. This prospective, randomized, placebo and positively controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the short-term clinical effects of a commercially available gel containing Acacia arabica in the reduction of <e>plaque</e> and gingival inflammation in subjects with gingivitis. Methods: Ninety subjects diagnosed with chronic generalized gingivitis were selected and randomly divided into three groups: Group I - placebo gel, Group II - gumtone gel and Group III - 1% chlorhexidine gel. Clinical evaluation was undertaken using the gingival index of Loe and Silness and the plaque index at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks. A subjective evaluation was undertaken by questionnaire. Results: Gumtone gel showed significant clinical improvement in gingival and plaque index scores as compared to a placebo gel. This improvement was comparable to 1% chlorhexidine gel. Unlike chlorhexidine gel, gumtone gel was not associated with any discolouration of teeth or unpleasant taste. Conclusions: Gumtone gel may be a useful herbal formulation for chemical plaque control agent and improvement in plaque and gingival status.",M2

A diode laser was used as an effective and safe method to remove the patient's overgrown gingival tissue.",M2
20400721,"Building caries risk assessment models for children.Despite the well-recognized importance of caries risk assessment, practical models remain to be established. This study was designed to develop biopsychosocial models for caries risk assessment in various settings. With a questionnaire, an oral examination, and biological (salivary, microbiological, and <e>plaque</e> pH) tests, a prospective study was conducted among 1782 children aged 3-6 years, with 1576 (88.4%) participants followed in 12 months. Multiple risk factors, indicators, and protective factors were identified. Various risk assessment models were constructed by the random selection of 50% of the cases and further validated in the remaining cases. For the prediction of a  one-year caries increment , screening models without biological tests achieved a sensitivity/specificity of 82%/73%; with biological tests, full-blown models achieved the sensitivity/specificity of 90%/90%. For identification of a quarter of the children with high caries burden (baseline dmft &gt; 2), a community-screening model requiring only a questionnaire reached a sensitivity/specificity of 82%/81%. These models are promising tools for cost-effective caries control and evidence-based treatment planning.

20387343,"[Non-Restorative Cavity Treatment. Managing rather than masking caries activity]The traditional restorative approach to active dentin caries in the temporary dentition is questioned. This paper argues in favour of a causal approach. The causal approach focuses on caries management. Restoration is of secondary importance. Delay or replacement of invasive restorative treatment by a causal approach decreases discomfort for children and promotes oral health over time. A form of causal treatment is the so called Non-Restorative Cavity Treatment. This approach requires that some measures be taken for managing cavitated caries lesions: 1. written informed consent; 2. making the cavity accessible for <e>plaque</e> removal; 3. treating carious dentition with anti-cariogenic agents and/or applying a protective layer to the carious dentition; 4. monitoring the caries process; 5. effective communication about dental health education. Some diagnostic criteria are important for the risk assessment of cavitated lesions: 1. activity of the caries lesion; 2. accessibility of the caries lesion for plaque control; 3. depth of the cavity; 4. condition of the pulp. CONCLUSION: the causal approach can arrest the caries process even in advanced stages of decay.",M2
20381791,"Relationship among microbiological composition and presence of dental <e>plaque</e>, sugar exposure, social factors and different stages of early childhood caries.OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship among microbiological composition of dental plaque, sugar exposure and social factors, as well as the presence of visible plaque in preschoolers with different stages of early childhood caries. DESIGN: A total of 169 children were clinically examined according to the World Health Organisation criteria + early caries lesions and were divided into three groups: caries-free (n=53), early caries lesions-ECL (n=56), and cavitated caries lesions-CCL (n=60). The presence of clinically visible dental plaque on maxillary incisors was recorded. After that, dental plaque from all buccal and lingual smooth surfaces was collected and the number of colony-forming units of mutans streptococci and total microorganism, as well as the presence of lactobacilli was determined. Daily frequency of meals containing sugar was assessed by a diet chart whereas social factors were evaluated by a questionnaire. The data were analysed by chi-square test followed by multiple logistic regressions (alpha=0.05, confidence interval=95%). RESULTS: High levels of mutans streptococci (OR=2.28), high total sugar exposure (OR=5.45) and presence of dental plaque (OR=2.60) showed significant association with ECL (p&lt;0.05). High total microorganism count (OR=5.18), high solid sugar exposure (OR=2.50) and the presence of lactobacilli (OR=24.99) revealed significant association with CCL (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the conclusion that dietary sugar experience influenced the microbiological composition of dental plaque. Moreover, the early stage of caries is highly affected by mutans streptococci and visible dental plaque on maxillary incisors whereas cavities are strongly related to lactobacilli and total microorganism.",M2
20379030,"Antibacterial activity of composite resin with glass-ionomer filler particles.The purpose of this study was to examine the antibacterial activity of composite resin with glass-ionomer filler particles versus that of contemporary commercial composite resins. Three composite resins were used: Beautifil II (containing S-PRG filler), Clearfil AP-X, and Filtek Z250. Resin blocks were bonded to maxillary first molars, and <e>plaque</e> accumulation on the resin block surface was examined after 8 hours. For the antibacterial test, the number of Streptococcus mutans in contact with the composite resin blocks after incubation for 12 hours was determined, and adherence of radiolabeled bacteria was evaluated. Less dental plaque was formed on Beautifil II resin block as compared to the other two materials. Antibacterial test revealed that there were no significant differences in the number of Streptococcus mutans among the three composite resins. However, the adherence of radiolabeled bacteria to the saliva-treated resin surface was significantly (p&lt;0.01) lower in Beautifil II than in the other two materials. These results suggested that Beautifil II could reduce dental plaque formation and bacterial adherence, leading to prevention of secondary caries.",M2
20378014,"A split-mouth study on microbiological profile in clinical healthy teeth and implants related to key inflammatory mediators.This split-mouth study investigated the correlation of the qualitative and quantitative bacterial composition in dental <e>plaque</e> around clinically healthy periodontal and peri-implant subgingival sites with the levels of selected pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and the inflammatory infiltrate in the soft tissue surrounding a healthy dental implant and natural tooth in the same patient. Nine patients, all in good health and non-smokers, were studied. All of the patients were highly motivated in terms of oral hygiene and had healthy natural teeth and at least one healthy implant. After three sessions of professional oral care, clinical parameters were recorded. A sample of subgingival plaque was harvested with a sterile curette from the buccal side of the selected implants and teeth. The plaque samples were cultured to quantify the total microbiota and the number of obligate and facultative bacterial strains. Simultaneously, from the lingual/palatal aspect of the same implants and teeth the keratinized periodontal and peri-implant soft tissues were biopsied for cytokine expression and histomorphometric analysis. The tissue biopsies were halved: the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect active TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-8, and TGF-beta2 and distribution, composition, quantification of inflammation were assessed in parallel. The patients harbored no periodontopathogens and the microbiological composition of the plaque taken from implant sites did not differ from that harvested from teeth. No significant differences were seen between implants and teeth for both proand anti-inflammatory cytokines. Even the histological examination showed no significant epithelial changes, although slight perivascular lymphocytic infiltration was seen in some biopsies.",M2
20359448,"[Reciprocal relationships between orthodontics and periodontics: relevance of a synergistic action]The aim of this article is to review evidence on the reciprocal relationships between orthodontics and periodontics. Normal intra-arch and inter-arch relationships have long been considered as an anatomic prerequisite for the preservation of dental health and function. Certain malocclusion traits are associated with difficulties in maintaining good oral hygiene and as a consequence to poor periodontal condition. Therefore, proper alignment of the teeth provided by orthodontic treatment may promote good control of soft deposit and calculus and subsequent periodontal inflammation. The tendency of orthodontic appliances, particularly the brackets and bands to promote the accumulation of <e>plaque</e> and thus increasing the risk of developing localized periodontal disease must however be constantly emphasized. Periodontitis involves progressive loss of the alveolar bone around the teeth, pathological tooth migration and gingival recession with pathological tooth migration and gingival recession as a possible outcome. The effectiveness of orthodontics in conjunction with periodontics in the management of these esthetic and functional defects is highlighted in this review.",M2
20359447,"[<e>Plaque</e> control, a key element of successful orthodontics]It is mainly because of periodontal tissues and, more particularly, the periodontal ligament that the orthodontist is able to move teeth. According the ratio cost/benefit/security, the orthodontist needs to prevent and/or to avoid the deleterious effects of its treatments on periodontal tissues. Gingival inflammation with a high hyperplasia compound, periodontal attachment loss, bone loss and root resorption may result, in absolute value, in a reduction of periodontal support. The key to prevent these problems is plaque control, phase too often neglected. The challenge before any orthodontic treatment, both in children or in adults, is to change the behavior of the patient concerning the mouth and the dental plaque. The aim of this paper is to explore the evidence based literature (systematic revues, meta-analysis), to provide thought elements and concrete proposals to definitely resolve this critical phase of orthodontic treatment that is the motivation, phase that can also be achieved by  dental auxiliaries .",M2
20359280,"Effect of full mouth rehabilitation on the amount of Streptococcus mutans in children with Early Childhood Caries.AIM: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of full mouth rehabilitation on the amount of S. mutans in children with Early Childhood Caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children between 2 and 5 years old treated under general anaesthesia participated in this study. Prior to treatment two baselines samples were collected, one of dental <e>plaque</e> and one of saliva. In addition, samples were obtained one week post operatively, and then three months later. In each sampling, the amount and the concentration (cfu/ml) of S. mutans were evaluated. RESULTS: The findings demonstrate that the operative procedures under general anaesthesia, significantly decrease (p&lt;0.01) the concentration (cfu/ml) and the amount of S. mutans for at least three months. After three months, saliva concentrations and plaque colony numbers of S. mutans increased significantly in relation to one week post-operatively (p&lt;0.01). However, none of the saliva or plaque samples collected three months following treatment reached the pretreatment levels of S. mutans in any of our subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicates that full mouth rehabilitation under general anaesthesia produces a statistically significant decrease in S. mutans levels for at least three months.",M2
20359275,"Effectiveness of <e>plaque</e> indicators and air polishing for the sealing of pits and fissures.AIM: Sealing of pits and fissures is one of the most effective techniques in caries prevention: however incomplete removal of plaque debris, can cause lack of retention of the sealant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty first permanent molars were sealed for this study. The teeth were divided into four groups. All teeth were isolated with a dental dam before cleaning and coronal polishing was performed with synthetic bristles or air polishing. Disclosing solution was used to reveal plaque. Three different operators performed cleanings and sealing. RESULTS: The results show that the plaque indicator was necessary to ensure complete cleansing of pit and fissures. PROPHYflex3 was the easiest and most effective device for removing plaque and debris. Synthetic bristles failed to thoroughly cleanse the surface in most attempts. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that pits and fissures should be cleaned with a plaque indicator and air polishers before placing a sealing material to ensure complete removal of plaque from the tooth.",M2
20350712,"Caries risk and orthodontic treatment.It is now established that orthodontic treatment increases the risk of carious lesions, with consequent harm to the patient and a high risk of compromising treatment outcome. This risk is related to the appliances, which increase the number of sites where <e>plaque</e> can accumulate as well as to changes in the bacterial flora and the age of the patient. A thorough evaluation of the risk of caries is therefore needed before any appliance is put in place and further evaluations should then be performed regularly throughout the course of treatment. In addition, preventive measures should be taken, involving first and foremost educating and motivating patients regarding the need for good oral hygiene. Prevention also implies adequate usage of the various sources of local fluoride administration, notably the application of fluoride-rich varnish. Other prophylactic measures such as using chlorhexidine varnish and sealing dental grooves are also recommended. Finally, the orthodontist can reduce to a minimum the use of items likely to retain dental plaque such as bands and elastomeric ties. The aim of this article is to suggest a specific diagnostic approach and to present the scientifically validated prevention measures, which need to be applied throughout orthodontic treatment.",M2
20344897,"Supragingival and subgingival <e>plaque</e>: paradigm of biofilms.Most microorganisms in nature live in multispecies communities attached to a substratum-biofilms. Within these communities, organismal interaction is spatiotemporally defined. Because biofilms exist at an interface, their environment is characterized by gradients of nutrients that encourage spatial and metabolic diversity within the population. Oral bacterial biofilms were among the first human-associated biofilms to have been extensively investigated. They are diverse in species, and that diversity reflects the range of habitats within the oral cavity. Oral bacterial communities can be studied in vitro and in vivo. These studies have yielded information on interorganismal interactions and the developmental patterns within the communities. The wealth of information on these communities, coupled with their accessibility in their natural state, firmly establishes them as paradigm systems in biofilm research.",M2
20331802,"Identification and characterization of amylase-binding protein C from Streptococcus mitis NS51.A substantial proportion of the streptococcal species found in dental <e>plaque</e> biofilms are able to interact with the abundant salivary enzyme alpha-amylase. These streptococci produce proteins that specifically bind amylase. An important plaque species, Streptococcus mitis, secretes a 36-kDa amylase-binding protein into the extracellular milieu. Proteins precipitated from S. mitis NS51 cell culture supernatant by the addition of purified salivary amylase were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane, and a prominent 36-kDa band was cut from the membrane and sequenced to yield the N-terminal amino acid sequence DSQAQYSNGV. Searching the S. mitis genome sequence database revealed a single open reading frame containing this sequence, and the gene was amplified by the S. mitis genomic DNA polymerase chain reaction. The coding region of this open reading frame, designated amylase-binding protein C (AbpC), was cloned into an Escherichia coli expression vector and the recombinant AbpC (rAbpC) was purified from the soluble fraction of the E. coli cell lysate. Purified AbpC was found to interact with immobilized amylase, confirming AbpC as a new streptococcal amylase-binding protein.",M2
20331796,"Perpetuation of subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.This study evaluated the reproducibility of in-vitro-grown biofilms, initiated with subgingival <e>plaque</e> from patients with periodontal disease, and continued through several cycles by re-inoculating new biofilms from previously grown biofilms. Subgingival plaque samples from bleeding pockets along with saliva samples were collected from three patients with chronic periodontitis and perpetuated through seven cycles. Calcium hydroxyapatite disks were coated with sterilized saliva inoculated with dispersed subgingival plaque. The biofilms were grown anaerobically at 37 degrees C for 10 days, and at specific intervals total viable bacteria were enumerated and the species present were analysed by DNA-DNA checkerboard hybridization. All cycles of biofilm growth occurred at similar rates and reached steady-state at day 7. No statistically or microbially significant differences were found for viable counts or species present, at the same period of maturation, among the different cycles. This study demonstrated that growth of certain target subgingival periodontal species in this biofilm model was reproducible and could be perpetuated in vitro through several cycles. The model could be useful in future studies to characterize different periodontopathogenic properties and biofilm interactions, especially in recolonization studies.",M2
20305866,"Novel ceria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia/alumina nanocomposite as framework material for posterior fixed dental prostheses: preliminary results of a prospective case series at 1 year of function.OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical performance of veneered ceria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia/alumina-nanocomposite (Ce-TZP/A-nanocomposite) frameworks for three-unit fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). METHOD AND MATERIALS: Eight patients in need of one FDP replacing one premolar or molar were included in this case series. Eight Ce-TZP/A-nanocomposite FDP frameworks were fabricated with a CAD/CAM system (Hint-Els) and veneered with a zirconia veneering ceramic (Vintage ZR, Shofu). The FDPs were cemented with resin cement (baseline) and were evaluated at baseline; 2 weeks; and 3, 6, and 12 months after cementation. For the technical evaluation, the USPHS criteria were used. The biologic outcome was judged by comparing the <e>plaque</e> control record (PCR), bleeding on probing (BOP), and probing pocket depth (PPD) of the abutment teeth (test) and untreated contralateral teeth (control). Radiographs were made at baseline and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. The data were descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: The mean observation period of the eight examined FDPs was 12.8 +/- 1.1 months. The survival rate of the FDPs was 100%. Furthermore, no technical or biologic complications were found. No differences of the mean (m) PCR (test: 0.1 +/- 0.1, control: 0.2 +/- 0.2), mBOP (test: 0.2 +/- 0.2, control: 0.1 +/- 0.1), and mPPD (test: 2.6 +/- 0.8, control: 2.6 +/- 0.6) were found between test and control teeth. CONCLUSIONS: Ce-TZP/A nanocomposite was found to be a reliable framework material at 1 year of function. Longer observation periods and randomized controlled clinical trials including more patients are needed to validate these findings.",M2

20225470,"Effect of a calcium glycerophosphate fluoride dentifrice formulation on enamel demineralization in situ.PURPOSE: To evaluate in situ the effect and mechanisms involved in the anticariogenic effect of a calcium glycerophosphate fluoride dentifrice. METHODS: In a double-blind, crossover design, a non-F dentifrice (negative control), a F dentifrice and a F dentifrice containing 0.13% CaGP were compared regarding the inhibition of enamel demineralization. Both F dentifrices contained 1500 microg F/g (w/w) as sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP). Bovine enamel blocks were mounted in contact with a S. mutans test <e>plaque</e>, in palatal appliances worn by 10 volunteers. 30 minutes after treatment with the dentifrices, a sucrose rinse was performed and enamel demineralization was assessed after an additional 45 minutes. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed among groups in the calcium and inorganic phosphate concentrations in the fluid phase of the test plaque 30 minutes after the dentifrice use (P &gt; 0.05), but F concentration was significantly higher for both F dentifrices (P &lt; 0.05). Also, the dentifrices did not differ regarding the pH before or 5 minutes after the sugar challenge (P &gt; 0.05). A higher mineral loss was observed for the non-F dentifrice group (P &lt; 0.05), but no significant difference was observed between the F dentifrices containing CaGP or not (P &gt; 0.05).

20192867,"The microbiota associated with implants restored with platform switching: a preliminary report.BACKGROUND: It was demonstrated that implants restored according to a platform-switching concept presented less crestal bone loss than implants restored with standard protocols. The aim of this study is to examine differences between the composition of the peri-implant microbiotas associated with implants restored with the platform-switching approach and implants restored with a standard internal connection protocol. METHODS: A total of 48 implants were examined in 18 subjects: 33 implants were restored with platform switching, and 15 implants were restored using the traditional approach. Thirty-six months after prosthetic loading, subgingival <e>plaque</e> samples were taken from the mesio- and disto-buccal aspects of each implant and from one tooth adjacent to one of the implants in each subject. The levels of 40 subgingival species were measured using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Microbiologic parameters were averaged within each subject and across subjects in each clinical group (platform switching versus control) and site category (implants versus teeth) separately. The significance of differences between clinical groups and site categories was determined using the Mann-Whitney test and the Wilcoxon test, respectively. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between groups for any of the species. The platform-switching group showed a small trend for lower levels of early colonizer members of the Actinomyces, purple and yellow complexes, Campylobacter species, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Teeth and implants presented similar microbial profiles. CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggest that the difference in bone crest resorption between implants restored with platform switching compared to traditionally restored implants is not associated with differences in the peri-implant microbiota.",M2

This 10-week study was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of rotation/oscillation and sonic power toothbrushes in the reduction of plaque and gingivitis. METHODS: This two-treatment, parallel group, examiner-blind, randomized study had the subjects brush twice daily at home with their assigned rotation/oscillation or sonic toothbrush following manufacturer's instructions with center visits at baseline, and at 4 and 10 weeks following the baseline visit, for assessment of oral safety (all visits), plaque (baseline, Weeks 4 and 10), and gingivitis (baseline and Week 10). Gingivitis and number of bleeding sites were measured using the Löe-Silness Gingivitis Index, and plaque was measured using the Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index. RESULTS: At Week 10, 171 subjects were evaluable for plaque assessment (85 in Sonic group, 86 in rotation/oscillation group) and 165 subjects were evaluable for gingivitis and bleeding sites assessment (84 in sonic group, 81 in rotation/oscillation group). The rotation/oscillation group had statistically significantly lower gingivitis scores (by 3.5%) and statistically significantly fewer bleeding sites than the sonic group (by 16.1%) with P = 0.038 and 0.028, respectively, at Week 10. Compared to baseline, only the rotation/oscillation group showed a statistically significant improvement in gingivitis (P = 0.003) and bleeding (P &lt; 0.001) at Week 10. At both Weeks 4 and 10, the rotation/oscillation group had directionally lower plaque scores than the sonic group (by approximately 3%), but treatment group differences were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.1) at either time point. Both groups showed statistically significantly lower plaque scores at Weeks 4 and 10 relative to baseline.",M2
20171609,"Prevalence and distribution of serotype-specific genotypes of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in chronic periodontitis Brazilian subjects.OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested that Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is involved in the aetiology of aggressive periodontitis as well as chronic periodontitis. In addition, some authors have also reported that serotype-specific antigens of A. actinomycetemcomitans determine the severity of disease. This study aimed to elucidate the prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans and the distribution of A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes in Brazilian subjects with chronic periodontitis. DESIGN: A total of 486 individuals were enrolled in this survey. All patients received clinical examinations that included periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, <e>plaque</e>, and gingival indexes. Subgingival samples were taken for microbial analysis. The genomic DNA of A. actinomycetemcomitans was provided by PCR. RESULTS: Out of 486 subjects examined, A. actinomycetemcomitans was isolated in 85 (17.5%) individuals. Out of 85 positive samples, 68 were infected by at least 1 serotype, 7 by mixed infection, and 10 were non-serotyped. Serotypes d and f were not detected. Serotype c showed the highest prevalence (52.9%), followed by serotype a (31.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Intragroup analysis revealed that, in slight/moderate periodontitis, serotypes c and a were significantly more prevalent than serotypes b and d-f; the prevalence of serotype c in severe periodontitis was significantly greater than that of serotypes a and b. Our data were similar in Asian and Eurasian populations.",M2

To determine microbial risk markers for this infection, this study aimed to compare the microbiota of children with early childhood caries with that of caries-free children. <e>Plaque</e> samples from incisors, molars, and the tongue from 195 children attending pediatricians' offices were assayed by 74 DNA probes and by PCR to Streptococcus mutans. Caries-associated factors included visible plaque, child age, race, and snacking habits. Species were detected more frequently from tooth than tongue samples. Lactobacillus gasseri (p &lt; 0.01), Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, and S. mutans with Streptococcus sobrinus (all p &lt; 0.05) were positively associated with caries. By multifactorial analysis, the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus was negatively associated with caries. Prevotella nigrescens was the only species (p &lt; 0.05) significantly associated with caries by the 'false discovery' rate. Analysis of the data suggests that selected Lactobacillus species, in addition to mutans streptococci, are risk markers for early childhood caries.",M2
20157281,"Synchrotron radiation analysis of possible correlations between metal status in human cementum and periodontal disease.Periodontitis is a serious disease that affects up to 50% of an adult population. It is a chronic condition involving inflammation of the periodontal ligament and associated tissues leading to eventual tooth loss.

20155507,"The relationship between physiologic halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria of the tongue and gingival sulcus.To determine the influence of oral status on halitosis, the relationship between halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria present in <e>plaque</e> on the tongue and the subgingival sulcus was examined in 62 periodontally healthy adults. Halitosis indicators used were the organoleptic score; gas chromatography results [total volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) = H(2)S + CH(3)SH + (CH(3))(2)S]; Halimeter values; and the results of three clinical tests, plaque control record (PlCR), plaque index (PlI), and tongue coat status. Significant correlations with organoleptic scores was observed for PlCR, PlI, tongue coat status, VSC amounts, and Halimeter values, indicating that halitosis in periodontally healthy subjects tended to originate from tongue plaque deposits. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect six periodontopathic bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis, and Treponema denticola) from the tongue and subgingival plaque. Significant effects on the organoleptic scores, tongue coat status, total VSC, H(2)S and CH(3)SH amounts, and Halimeter values were observed only for T. denticola and F. nucleatum and only in the tongue plaque, not in the subgingival plaque. Thus, therapies developed to inhibit the growth of these bacteria may lead to future treatments of halitosis.",M2

In this study, we evaluated the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal with ultrasonic, electric, and manual toothbrushes on subgingival plaque composition in orthodontically banded molars. METHODS: Twenty-one patients wearing fixed orthodontic appliances were assigned to this single-blind crossover study. Samples of subgingival plaque were collected from banded molars, before and after each toothbrush usage period, for quantification of 22 bacterial species by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. For each crossover, patients used a toothbrush for 30 days, followed by a washout period of 14 days. RESULTS: The prevalence of Tannerella forsythia decreased significantly after a month of electric brush usage. In the manual brush group, the prevalences of Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Prevotella melaninogenica also decreased significantly. However, there were no significant differences in the prevalences and levels of bacteria after usage of the ultrasonic brush. Intergroup comparisons showed no statistical differences among the 3 brushes for the microbiologic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: All 3 brushes generally reduced bacterial prevalences, and, although electric and manual toothbrushes showed some isolated significant variations, we found no superiority with any toothbrush type when used three times daily for 2 minutes on microbiologic parameters in orthodontically banded molars.",M2

METHODS: Ten subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation (RT group) and 10 subjects with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS group) and matched controls with normal salivary secretion were included. Lactobacillus species were selected from their growth on Rogosa agar and identified by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism using HaeIII and HpaII restriction enzymes. RESULTS: Lactobacilli were isolated from 14 subjects (6 RT, 3 pSS, 5 controls). The most prevalent species were Lactobacillus fermentum (7 subjects), Lactobacillus casei (7 subjects) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (6 subjects). L. fermentum and L. casei were the most prevalent species in anterior sites and L. rhamnosus and L. fermentum in posterior sites. In anterior sites, hyposalivated subjects with high Lactobacillus counts had an increased plaque acidogenicity compared to those with low counts. In posterior sites, subjects with high Lactobacillus counts had a lower final pH compared with those with low counts. CONCLUSION: There were large intra- and inter-individual variations in frequencies of Lactobacillus species and Lactobacillus counts, but no specific species could be related to plaque acidogenicity.",M2

METHODS AND RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus and other related species were subjected to the detection of mecA and spa by both PCR and LAMP methods. The LAMP successfully amplified the genes under isothermal conditions at 64 degrees C within 60 min, and demonstrated identical results with the conventional PCR methods. The detection limits of the LAMP for mecA and spa, by gel electrophoresis, were 10(2) and 10 cells per tube, respectively. The naked-eye inspections were possible with 10(3) and 10 cells for detection of mecA and spa, respectively. The LAMP method was then applied to sputum and dental <e>plaque</e> samples. The LAMP and PCR demonstrated identical results for the plaque samples, although frequency in detection of mecA and spa by the LAMP was relatively lower for the sputum samples when compared to the PCR methods. CONCLUSION: Application of the LAMP enabled a rapid detection assay for mecA and spa. The assay may be applicable to clinical plaque samples. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The LAMP offers an alternative detection assay for mecA and spa with a great advantage of the rapidity.",M2
20139575,"The efficacy of a herbal-based toothpaste in the control of <e>plaque</e> and gingivitis: a clinico-biochemical study.OBJECTIVE: A double-blinded controlled clinical trial with parallel groups was designed to investigate the effectiveness of a herbal-based toothpaste in the control of plaque and gingivitis as compared with a conventional dentifrice. The efficacy of Colgate Herbal over Colgate tooth paste was assessed in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty subjects with gingivitis participated in the study. All participants had at least 20 natural teeth with no probing depths greater than 3 mm and a plaque index score of 2 or more at baseline. At baseline, the clinical parameters like gingival index, plaque index and salivary pH were estimated. Paired t-test was used to compare the difference within the groups and unpaired t-test was used to compare the difference between the groups at baseline and on the 30th day. RESULTS: At the end of the study, there were statistically significant reductions in the gingival index and the plaque index scores within the test group. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the test and the control groups. The salivary pH changes were not statistically significant in the test group but were displaced more toward the acidic range in the control group. CONCLUSION: It was however concluded that the herbal-based toothpaste was as effective as the conventionally formulated dentifrice in the control of plaque and gingivitis.",M2
20139564,"Community periodontal index of treatment needs index: an indicator of anaerobic periodontal infection.BACKGROUND: Community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN) index is commonly used to measure periodontal disease. It's uniqueness, apart from assessing the periodontal status, also gives the treatment needs for the underlying condition. Benzoyl-DL-arginine napthylamide (BANA) test is a chair side diagnostic test used to detect the presence of putative periodontal pathogens. We correlated the CPITN scores of patients with BANA test results to assess the validity of CPITN as an indicator of anaerobic periodontal infection. OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed to correlate the CPITN scores with the BANA activity of subgingival <e>plaque</e>. The objective was to assess the validity of CPITN index as indicator of anaerobic periodontal infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 80 sites were selected from 20 patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. After measuring the probing depth with CPITN C probe, the highest score from each sextant was selected according to the CPITN criteria and subgingival plaque samples were collected using a sterile curette and the BANA test was performed. RESULTS: Kendall's tau-b and Chi-square test were used to assess the correlation between the BANA test results and CPITN scores. Results indicated sensitivity (92.86%), specificity (80%) and agreement (91.25%); indicating the validity of CPITN in assessing anaerobic infection. CONCLUSION: There was a significant correlation between BANA test results and scores 3 and score 4 of CPITN index (P &lt; 0.001) clearly indicating the presence of anaerobic periodontal infection.",M2
20139560,"Effect of a single-use toothbrush on <e>plaque</e> microflora.AIM: To study and compare the microbial flora of dental plaque after the use of a self-contaminated toothbrush and that of a single-use toothbrush. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group included 40 young volunteers from Yenepoya Dental College, who were free from any systemic or oral disease. In these subjects, plaque samples were collected after 1 month use of a self-contaminated toothbrush. Each subject was given a set of 30 new toothbrushes and a toothpaste tube and instructed to use one toothbrush everyday and discard it after use. The plaque samples were collected on a weekly interval and cultured on Mitis Salivarius agar. The colonies were identified and speciated and their count was recorded. RESULTS: Streptococcus mitis, S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. milleri and Candida were recovered from the samples. A highly significant decrease in their numbers was found after the use of a single-use toothbrush (P value 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: As a contaminated toothbrush can reintroduce microorganisms into the oral cavity, it may be a sound practice to change the toothbrush as frequently as possible.",M2

20132189,"Diversity of Veillonella spp. from subgingival <e>plaque</e> by polyphasic approach.In a biofilm such as the subgingival microflora, strain-specific properties or factors induced by the host may impart a survival advantage to some bacterial strains. Periodontal disease has been associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and we previously found high amounts of Veillonella in the subgingival microflora of COPD subjects. Differentiation of Veillonella is difficult. The aims of this study were to identify subgingival Veillonella isolates by phenotypic, genetic typing and molecular genetic methods, and further, to assess if Veillonella strain properties or identity correlated with periodontal disease or COPD. From 22 subjects, 26 subgingival Veillonella isolates and one pulmonary isolate were analysed. The majority of the subgingival Veillonella isolates were identified as Veillonella parvula. Genotyping showed heterogeneity within strains of the same species. A subgingival and pulmonary isolate in one COPD subject was found to be genetically identical strains of V. parvula. Scanning electron microscopy of the lung biopsy confirmed single small cocci adhering or coaggregating with larger cocci on the airway epithelium. Apart from a variation in cellular fatty acid composition of six subgingival isolates from periodontitis subjects, no correlation between the subgingival Veillonella strains or genotypes and the presence of either periodontitis or COPD was found. In conclusion, V. parvula was the predominant subgingival Veillonella species with high genetic variability within strains of the same species. Subgingival V. parvula can translocate to the lungs; however, Veillonella identity or genotype did not correlate with periodontal disease or COPD.",M2
20129893,"The antimicrobial efficacy of commercial dentifrices.This investigation compared the effects of a fluoride dentifrice and toothpastes formulated with antimicrobial ingredients (stannous fluoride and triclosan/copolymer) on oral micro-organisms, including those found in samples taken from the human oral cavity. Microbiological techniques determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of each dentifrice necessary to inhibit the growth of bacterial strains from the healthy oral cavity, as well as those found in dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis. Ex vivo studies utilized oral rinse samples and supragingival <e>plaque</e> from adults to determine antimicrobial effects on the entire microbial diversity of these samples, including biofilm-derived micro-organisms. The triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the lowest MICs and significantly inhibited Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (including the periodontal pathogens Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum). In the ex vivo tests, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated substantial inhibition in the oral rinse samples over each treatment period (p &gt; 0.0005) as compared to either the fluoride or stannous fluoride dentifrices. Similarly, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the highest inhibition of micro-organisms in the supragingival plaque biofilm (p &lt; 0.0005). No significant differences were observed between the fluoride and stannous fluoride dentifrices (p &gt; 0.5).",M2

20128354,"Distribution of Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotypes in isolates from subgingival <e>plaque</e> and blood sample during bacteremia.INTRODUCTION: Porphyromonas gingivalis is considered as a major etiological agent in the onset and progression of chronic destructive periodontitis. Porphyromonus gingivalis fimA type has been correlated to the virulence potential of the strain; therefore this gene could be involved in the ability of P. gingivalis to reach blood stream. OBJECTIVE: The classifications of P. gingivalis fimA types will be compared in subgingival plaque and blood samples collected after scaling and root root planing of periodontitis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen periodontitis patients requiring scaling and root planing were enrolled. P. gingivalis isolates were classed to genotype with fimA type-specific PCR assay. fimA gene was sequenced if the isolate was listed as unclassifiable after PCR technique. RESULTS: Six patients showed positive P. gingivalis bacteremia. The most frequent fimA was fimA type II, followed by Ib, III and IV. In blood strains, type II was followed by IV, Ib and III. CONCLUSION: Type II was the most frequent genotype in blood samples and in subgingival plaque samples. However, no correlation was found between the frequency of any fimA type with SRP induced bacteremia. P. gingivalis fimA type appears to be conserved within individual patients throughout the times of sample collection, fimA gene sequence results were not in agreement with results of fimA genotyping by PCR.",M2
20128317,"Effect of herbal, essential oil, and chlorhexidine mouthrinses on the composition of the subgingival microbiota and clinical periodontal parameters.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if antimicrobial mouthrinses with different formulations could affect the composition of the subgingival microbiota and clinical parameters of adjacent tissues in periodontal maintenance subjects. METHODS: One-hundred and sixteen subjects, who had been treated for chronic periodontitis and were in a maintenance program, were randomly assigned one of four mouthrinses, to be used twice daily for three months. The mouthrinses were herbal 1, herbal 2, essential oil, and chlorhexidine. Clinical measurements and subgingival <e>plaque</e> samples were taken at baseline and at three months. Plaque samples were individually evaluated for 18 test species/taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significance of differences between baseline and three months for both microbiological and clinical parameters were determined using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. Significance of difference among groups for change in clinical and microbiological parameters was determined using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for baseline values. RESULTS: Shifts in species proportions differed significantly for 9/18 test species/taxa among the four mouthrinse groups. Streptococcus and Capnocytophaga species were reduced most in the herbal rinse groups, while Veillonella parvula was reduced most in the essential oil and chlorhexidine groups. Actinomyces were also markedly reduced in the chlorhexidine group. Mean Plaque (PI) and Gingival Indices (GI) were reduced between baseline and three months in each group. Results emphasize that chlorhexidine (p &lt; 0.001) and herbal (p &lt; 0.05) rinses significantly reduced PI. Some subjects in each group responded better than others. CONCLUSION: All four mouthrinses tested produced shifts in the composition of subgingival microbiota, although the results differed among the groups. The observed microbial changes were accompanied by improvements in clinical parameters in the periodontal maintenance subjects.",M2
20126911,"Effect of absorbent tetracycline-loaded membrane used in the reduction of periodontal pockets: an in vivo study.This clinical study evaluated the influence of scaling and root planning (SRP), with and without the use of tetracycline-loaded bovine absorbent membrane, in the reduction of periodontal pockets according to 3 parameters: probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and <e>plaque</e> index (PI). Twenty-four patients were selected totalizing 144 random teeth divided in 2 groups (n=72 teeth) - control (SRP) and experimental (SRP with tetracycline-loaded absorbent membrane). PPD, BOP and PI were determined before and 28 days after the treatment. In all patients, the PPD values at the end of the treatment were always lower than the baseline values. There was a reduction of the PI for both treatments, but it was more evident on the experimental group. In conclusion, the use of tetracycline-loaded absorbent membrane could result in a better prognosis compared to scaling and root planning after only 28 days of evaluation.",M2
20123706,"Transmission of diverse oral bacteria to murine placenta: evidence for the oral microbiome as a potential source of intrauterine infection.Microbial infection of the intrauterine environment is a major cause of preterm birth. The current paradigm indicates that intrauterine infections predominantly originate from the vaginal tract, with the organisms ascending into the sterile uterus. With the improvements in technology, an increasing number of bacterial species have been identified in intrauterine infections that do not belong to the vaginal microflora. We have demonstrated previously that intrauterine infections can originate from the oral cavity following hematogenous transmission. In this study, we begin to systemically examine what proportion of the oral microbiome can translocate to the placenta. Pooled saliva and pooled subgingival <e>plaque</e> samples were injected into pregnant mice through tail veins to mimic bacteremia, which occurs frequently during periodontal infections. The microbial species colonizing the murine placenta were detected using 16S rRNA gene-based PCR and clone analysis. A diverse group of bacterial species were identified, many of which have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in humans although their sources of infection were not determined. Interestingly, the majority of these species were oral commensal organisms. This may be due to a dose effect but may also indicate a unique role of commensal species in intrauterine infection. In addition, a number of species were selectively  enriched  during the translocation, with a higher prevalence in the placenta than in the pooled saliva or subgingival plaque samples. These observations indicate that the placental translocation was species specific. This study provides the first insight into the diversity of oral bacteria associated with intrauterine infection.",M2
20112640,"[Oral jewelry: a review]Oral jewelry is popular. One of the most widely spread types are so-called tooth diamonds made of composite materials which are applied to the teeth with an adhesive. Note that parents are required to sign a release form for under-aged patients in Switzerland. Tooth cap grills and gold teeth are considered status symbols within the Hip-Hop fashion scene. However, tooth ornaments favour the accumulation of <e>plaque</e> and can diminish the ability to articulate. With respect to jewelry in oral soft tissue especially tongue and lip piercings are of significance to dentists. Besides the systemic complications, which are mostly caused by a lack of hygiene or the failure of noting medical contraindications by the piercer, local complications occur frequently. After surgery, pain, swelling, infections as well as hemorrhages or hematomas can be observed. Long-term effects can be problematic: gingival recession can be discernes mainly in the case of lip piercings the loss of hard tooth substance in the case of tongue piercings. Because of that, conservation therapies can become indespensable. Patients wearing dental jewelry have to be aware of risks of tooth damage, and they regularly have to undergo dental check-ups. Information campaigns--for dentists as well as patients--are necessary.",M2

The test plaque was exposed to non-F or MFP (1,450 microg F/g) dentifrices and the fluid phase of the plaque was analyzed after 15, 30, 45 and 75 min. MFP concentration in the plaque fluid decreased over time after exposure to MFP dentifrice, but F ion reached 134.9 +/- 32.0 microM at 15 min and decreased significantly only at 75 min, suggesting continuous MFP hydrolysis by the test plaque.",M2
20109998,"A randomized, double-blind clinical study to assess the antimicrobial effects of a cetylpyridinium chloride mouth rinse on dental <e>plaque</e> bacteria.BACKGROUND: Studies with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) mouth rinses that range from 1 use to 6 months of use have documented the clinical efficacy of these formulations on supragingival plaque and gingivitis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of a commercially available mouth rinse containing 0.05% CPC versus a fluoride mouth rinse on the anaerobic bacteria found in dental plaque. Antimicrobial effects on the organisms of the supragingival plaque, a natural biofilm, were determined after 1 use and after 14 days of use of each mouth rinse. METHODS: After enrollment, adult subjects from China completed a 1-week washout period and provided baseline samples of supragingival plaque for analysis of anaerobic bacteria. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a commercially available mouth rinse formulated with 0.05% CPC or a fluoride mouth rinse. Subjects were assigned to each group according to a computer-generated randomization sequence. They were instructed to rinse with 20 mL of either the CPC or the fluoride mouth rinse for 30 seconds. Microbiologic analyses of dental plaque samples were conducted 12 hours after the first use of assigned mouth rinse. Subjects were instructed to continue twice-daily rinsing with their assigned mouth rinse for the next 14 days in addition to brushing their teeth with a commercial fluoride toothpaste. Dental plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected on day 15; this was done 12 hours after the final use of the assigned mouth rinses. A dentist conducted oral examinations before each sample collection to evaluate hard and soft tissue health over the course of the study. RESULTS: The study included 117 adults (62 females, mean age, 28.70 years; 55 males, mean age, 30.41 years). Subjects rinsing with the CPC mouthwash (n = 58; mean age, 29.41 years) reported significant reductions in anaerobic bacteria versus those issued the fluoride rinse (n = 59; mean age, 29.61 years) 12 hours after 1 use and 12 hours after 14 days of use (P &lt; 0.001). The mean percent reduction in anaerobic bacteria between the CPC mouth rinse and the fluoride mouth rinse was 29.98% after 1 use and 57.90% after 14 days of use. All enrolled subjects completed the study without any adverse events. CONCLUSION: Use of the CPC mouth rinse was associated with significant reductions in the anaerobic bacteria of supragingival plaque compared with fluoride mouth rinse use in these adult subjects.",M2

METHODS: Twenty 7- to 11-year-olds participated in this randomized controlled study. The test food groups were raisins, bran flakes, commercial raisin bran cereal (cRB) and experimental raisin bran cereal (eRB). Ten percent sucrose and sorbitol were used as positive and negative controls. The in vivo plaque pH was measured with a touch microelectrode (Beetrode) prior to (baseline) and 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes after consuming a test food or rinsing with a control solution. RESULTS: All test foods reduced plaque pH over the 30-minute period, with the largest reduction noted between 10 to 15 minutes. Consumption of cRB produced the largest pH drop compared to the other food groups at 10 minutes (P &lt; .001). Addition of raisins to bran flakes (eRB) promoted a less pronounced pH drop beyond 10 minutes when compared to bran flakes alone (P &lt; .001). Consumption of raisins or eRB did not reduce plaque pH below 6 over the 30-minute testing period. CONCLUSION: The ranking in order of study test foods in promoting plaque acidogenicity is: (1) commercial raisin bran cereal; (2) bran flakes; (3) raisins; and (4) experimental raisin bran cereal.",M2

20098966,"Periodontal bacterial load: a proposed new epidemiological method for periodontal disease assessment.AIM: The purpose of this study was to identify a periodontal clinical measure that correlates with red complex bacteria usually associated with periodontal disease. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Periodontal clinical parameters were recorded in 116 postpartum women at six sites per tooth for all teeth excluding third molars. Two subgingival <e>plaque</e> samples per subject were collected and analyzed for 39 bacterial species using the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Periodontal Bacterial Load (PBL) was calculated as the sum of all pocket depth measurements of 4 mm at sites with a Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) of 4 mm. The association of clinical and bacterial scores was analyzed using the Spearman correlation coefficient and the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The PBL was correlated with microorganisms from the red complex that included Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola, individually or grouped (p&lt;0.05). The PBL was not associated with periodontally beneficial species from the yellow, green, purple, and blue complexes (p&gt;0.05). The proportions and mean counts of the red complex were increased according to the quartile groups of distribution of the PBL. CONCLUSION: PBL appears to be a reliable measure of periodontal status in postpartum women.

20096398,"The effect of sucrose on <e>plaque</e> and saliva urease levels in vivo.OBJECTIVE: Dietary sugar exposures induce an immediate drop of the plaque pH. Based on in vitro observations, it was hypothesized that oral bacteria may rapidly respond to this environmental change by increasing the activity or expression of alkali-generating pathways, such as the urease pathway. The objective of this exploratory in vivo study was to determine the short-term effect of a brief sucrose exposure on plaque and saliva urease activity and expression, and to relate this effect to caries experience. METHODS: Urease activity levels were measured in plaque and saliva samples collected from 20 children during fasting conditions and 30 min after rinsing with a sucrose solution. Streptococcus salivarius ureC-specific mRNA in saliva was quantified using real-time RT-PCR. The impact of host-related factors, such as age, gender, sugar consumption, salivary mutans streptococci levels and caries status on urease activity was evaluated. RESULTS: Plaque urease activity under fasting conditions was higher in subjects with low caries and mutans streptococci levels. This difference was not observed after the sucrose exposure. The response of urease to sucrose in vivo did not depend on caries experience or salivary mutans levels. Significant increase in urease activity of plaque and saliva after exposure to sucrose was observed only in the subjects who had low urease levels at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this exploratory study suggest that plaque urease activity may have an important long-term influence in caries development but not during a cariogenic challenge.",M2
20096078,"The influence of academic stress on gingival inflammation.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of academic stress on periodontal health, in relation to inflammatory markers in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and cortisol in saliva. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 20 healthy dental hygienists (females: mean age 29.3 +/- 8.5 SD) and was conducted during a major exam period and 4 weeks later after the exams. A clinical examination was performed and GCF was collected from four sites in each subject on these two occasions. Interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 levels were determined using Luminex 100 and cortisol amounts by radioimmunoassay (RIA (125)I). Students registered their perceived stress on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Significance of the findings was determined using paired t-test, Wilcoxon-matched pair and Spearman's rank correlations. RESULTS: Students had higher amounts of dental <e>plaque</e> (P &lt; 0.007) and gingival inflammation (P &lt; 0.001) during the exam period compared with after the exams. The amounts of IL-6 and IL-10 in GCF were significantly increased during the time of examinations. The median level of cortisol in saliva was also significantly raised during the exam period compared with after the exams, 20.52 nmol/l (range: 11.91-27.34) and 16.41 nmol/l (range: 10.91-24.17) respectively, P &lt; 001.

20096075,"Orthodontic considerations for gingival health during pregnancy: a review.Gingivitis is caused by several known systemic and local factors. Among systemic factors, the role of hormonal changes during pregnancy is well established. While presence of fixed orthodontic appliances alone may not cause gingivitis, factors such as pregnancy and poor oral hygiene combined together could precipitate acute gingival inflammation that may progress to a periodontal condition in a patient receiving orthodontic therapy. There has been an increase in the number of adult patients who are receiving orthodontic treatment. Orthodontic appliances could act as a potential <e>plaque</e> retentive source and aggravate inflammatory reactions that are seen during pregnancy. There is a lack of awareness regarding oral healthcare issues among patients who are pregnant and choose to seek orthodontic treatment. In addition, there is a need in the literature to outline management guidelines for patients who want to receive orthodontic treatment during pregnancy, with or without pre-existing gingival conditions. This review focuses on the aetiology of pregnancy gingivitis and the management of orthodontic patients during pregnancy. Our emphasis is on patient education, oral hygiene maintenance, preventive and treatment strategies for the management of gingival health in orthodontic patients during pregnancy. We also highlight some of the possible complications of initiating orthodontic treatment during pregnancy.",M2
20096064,"Epithelial cell pro-inflammatory cytokine response differs across dental <e>plaque</e> bacterial species.AIM: The dental plaque is comprised of numerous bacterial species, which may or may not be pathogenic. Human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs) respond to perturbation by various bacteria of the dental plaque by production of different levels of inflammatory cytokines, which is a putative reflection of their virulence. The aim of the current study was to determine responses in terms of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 secretion induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus gordonii in order to gauge their virulence potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HGECs were challenged with the four bacterial species, live or heat killed, at various multiplicity of infections and the elicited IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 responses were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Primary HGECs challenged with live P. gingivalis produced high levels of IL-1beta, while challenge with live A. actinomycetemcomitans gave high levels of IL-8. The opportunistic pathogen F. nucleatum induces the highest levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the commensal S. gordonii is the least stimulatory. CONCLUSION: We conclude that various dental plaque biofilm bacteria induce different cytokine response profiles in primary HGECs that may reflect their individual virulence or commensal status.",M2

A preliminary 1-year clinical study.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate plaque accumulation and peri-implant tissue response adjacent to machined and dual acid-etched (DAE) titanium implant surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two types of implants were used-control implants with a DAE surface in their apical portion and a machined coronal part, and test implants with a DAE surface throughout their entire length. A total of 10 sets of implants were placed in the posterior quadrants of eight patients, with at least 2 implants (1 control and 1 test implant) placed in each site. Machined healing abutments were placed on the control implants and DAE-surfaced healing abutments on the test implants. Plaque Index and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded together with histologic and microbiologic analyses of the peri-implant tissues. The healing abutments underwent a scanning electron microscope scan at 5 months postsurgery. Standardized radiographs were also taken at the time of implant placement and 3, 6, and 12 months postsurgery. RESULTS: DAE surfaces accumulated more plaque than machined surfaces (P &lt; .0006) and the plaque was assessed as more difficult to remove (P &lt; .0143). No histologic abnormalities were seen and the test implants showed significantly lower crestal bone resorption than the control (P &lt; .0174). CONCLUSION: DAE healing abutments showed an increased plaque accumulation, but no significant BOP differences or histologic analyses were found between test and control sites. The test implants showed less interproximal bone resorption than the control ones at the end of a 1-year follow-up evaluation.",M2
20090328,"Inhibition of caries progression by resin infiltration in situ.The infiltration of caries lesions with low-viscosity light-curing resins (infiltrants) has been shown to inhibit further demineralization in vitro. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of resin infiltration in preventing lesion progression in situ. In each of 104 bovine enamel specimens, 2 artificial enamel caries lesions were created. The specimens were randomly allocated to 2 groups: in the test group, 1 of the lesions was etched for 5 s (37% H(3)PO(4)) and subsequently infiltrated twice with a preproduct infiltrant, each time for 60 s. As a positive control, 1 lesion was superficially sealed with a fissure sealant. The second lesion in each specimen served as an untreated control. The specimens were inserted into intraoral appliances and worn by 11 volunteers in the mandibular buccal sulcus for 100 days. <e>Plaque</e> accumulation was promoted by a mesh, and the appliances were stored in 10% sucrose solution (2 x 30 min/day). The specimens were analyzed using transversal microradiography and wavelength-independent microradiography. The specimens of 2 participants were excluded from analysis. The baseline integrated mineral losses (transversal microradiography values; mean +/- SD: 2474 +/- 549 vol% x mum) and lesion depths (98 +/- 20 mum) did not differ significantly between the various groups (p &gt; 0.05; paired t test). After the in situ phase, the infiltrated and positive control lesions showed significantly less progression compared to the untreated controls (p &lt; 0.05).

Two randomized, double-blind, crossover studies were conducted to investigate the potential of CPP-ACP added to hard candy confections to slow the progression of enamel subsurface lesions in an in situ model. The confections studied were: (1) control sugar (65% sucrose + 33% glucose syrup); (2) control sugar-free; (3) sugar + 0.5% (w/w) CPP-ACP; (4) sugar + 1.0% (w/w) CPP-ACP; (5) sugar-free + 0.5% (w/w) CPP-ACP. Participants (10 and 14 in study 1 and 2) wore a removable palatal appliance containing enamel half-slabs with subsurface lesions, except for meals and oral hygiene procedures, and consumed 1 confection 6 times a day for 10 days. The enamel half-slabs were inset to allow the development of <e>plaque</e> on the enamel surface. Participants rested for 1 week before crossing over to another confection. The appliances were stored in a humid container at 37 degrees C when not in the mouth. After each treatment period, the enamel half-slabs were removed, paired with their demineralized control half-slabs, embedded, sectioned and then analysed using transverse microradiography. In both studies consumption of the control sugar confection resulted in significant demineralization (progression) of the enamel subsurface lesions. However, consumption of the sugar confections containing CPP-ACP did not result in lesion progression, but in fact in significant remineralization (regression) of the lesions. Remineralization by consumption of the sugar + 1.0% CPP-ACP confection was significantly greater than that obtained with the sugar-free confection.",M2
20090325,"Cross-sectional microhardness of human enamel subjected to erosive, cariogenic or combined erosive/cariogenic challenges.This in situ study evaluated the interaction between caries and erosion processes. In the first phase, enamel specimens were subjected to erosion without dental <e>plaque</e> (EO) or to erosion with plaque (EP); in the second phase, they were subjected to erosion plus cariogenic challenge (EC) or cariogenic challenge (CO), both with plaque accumulation. Cross-sectional hardness data (10-330 microm depth) were tested using ANOVA (alpha = 0.05). EO and EP showed surface softening to 10 microm depth. CO and EC produced subsurface lesions, of similar depth (up to 220 microm), with CO showing higher integrated loss of hardness than EC, indicating that cariogenic and erosive challenges did not have an additive effect.",M2
20088984,"Efficacy of a low-concentration chlorhexidine mouth rinse in non-compliant periodontitis patients attending a supportive periodontal care programme: a randomized clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and microbiological efficacy of a 0.05% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetyl-pyridinium chloride mouth rinse in supportive periodontal care (SPC) in patients with inadequate <e>plaque</e> control. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis under SPC with an inadequate plaque control (Turesky index &gt;1). After supragingival prophylaxis and oral hygiene reinforcement, participants rinsed twice a day for 3 months with the test or placebo solutions, in addition to conventional hygiene. Primary clinical outcome variables included plaque and gingival indices. As secondary outcomes, periodontal and microbiological variables were studied. ancova and chi(2) tests were used to compare the variables. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (22 placebo and 25 test group) participated. After 3 months, plaque levels increased in the placebo group, while diminished in the test group (p&lt;0.001). Similar effects were found for bleeding on probing. The other clinical parameters did not show significant differences. Microbiological variables demonstrated inter-group significant reductions in subgingival counts of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia and a decrease of the total bacterial counts in saliva. CONCLUSIONS: The tested mouth rinse demonstrated efficacy in reducing plaque and gingivitis, as well as in decreasing the microbial load in saliva and gingival sulcus.",M2
20088983,"Gingival changes during pregnancy: II. Influence of hormonal variations on the subgingival biofilm.AIM: To determine whether the exacerbated gingival inflammation that develops in pregnant women is related to a change in the subgingival biofilm induced by the increase in hormone levels during pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This open cohort study included 48 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women without periodontitis. Pregnant women were evaluated in the first, second and third trimester and at 3 months after delivery. Non-pregnant women were evaluated twice, with a 6-month interval, assessing microbiological, clinical and hormonal variables at each visit. Total anaerobic counts and frequency of detection and proportions were calculated. The Friedman test with the Bonferroni correction was used for intra-group comparisons and Mann-Whitney U-tests for inter-group assessment. Correlations were analysed by means of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Proportions of the subgingival periodontal pathogens did not differ throughout pregnancy, although significant differences were found for all the pathogens after delivery. Porphyromonas gingivalis-positive patients presented an increase in gingival inflammation (p&lt;0.001) that was not related to <e>plaque</e>. Correlations were found between maternal hormone levels and P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. CONCLUSION: Qualitative differences in periodontal pathogens were found from pregnancy to post-partum. Patients harbouring P. gingivalis presented and increased gingival inflammatory status.",M2
20074237,"Cultivation of a Synergistetes strain representing a previously uncultivated lineage.Subgingival <e>plaque</e> samples obtained from human subjects with periodontitis, shown to include previously uncultivable members of the phylum Synergistetes, were used to inoculate Cooked Meat Medium (CMM). The presence of Cluster A (uncultivable) Synergistetes was monitored by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). Cluster A Synergistetes were found to grow in CMM in co-culture with other plaque bacteria and growth was stimulated by the addition of mucin and serum. Plaque samples were also used to inoculate Blood Agar (BA) plates and growth of Cluster A Synergistetes was revealed after anaerobic incubation, by colony hybridization with specific probes. Surface growth on the plates in regions identified by colony hybridization was harvested and used to inoculate fresh plates, thus enriching for Cluster A Synergistetes. Cross-streaks of other plaque bacteria were also used to stimulate Synergistetes growth. In the early passages, no discrete Synergistetes colonies were seen, but after eight passages and the use of cross-streaks of other bacteria present in the enriched community, colonies arose, which consisted solely of Cluster A Synergistetes cells, as determined by 16S rRNA gene PCR and cloning. This is the first report of the successful culture of a member of the uncultivable branch of this phylum.",M2
20073546,"Clinical report on <e>plaque</e> formation, distribution and maturation within the primary, mixed and permanent dentitions.AIM: The report described the formation distribution and maturation of dental plaque within the primary, mixed and permanent dentitions. DESIGN: Eight caries-free volunteers who were 4-6 years of age participated in the study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The children received prophylaxis and refrained from toothbrushing for 48 hours. The occurrence and distribution of plaque in the primary dentition were assessed. One child continued the experiment from the age of 6 to 15. RESULTS: The recording of plaque was made and pictures were taken. In the primary dentition, 704 surfaces were assessed. Significant difference between plaque on buccal and other surfaces was recorded (p&lt; 0.001). In the mixed and permanent dentition plaque scores of 128 surfaces were recorded. Plaque scores of partially erupted posterior teeth and posterior teeth in full occlusion differed significantly with limited accumulation of occlusal plaque in the latter. CONCLUSION: The report highlights that the most critical period for plaque accumulation is the time from tooth emergence to full occlusion, when the tooth has a reduced participation in the mechanical oral function. As caries is a plaque induced disease, the potential to caries development in children during tooth eruption is consequently high.",M2
20073544,"The dentist's role in recognizing childhood abuses: study on the dental health of children victims of abuse and witnesses to violence.AIM: Up to today, little attention and training has been paid, in the Italian dental field, to a dramatically widespread problem, childhood abuse and neglect (CAN). Our research fits into a current of thought on alerting physicians, not only paediatricians, to the problem of abused children. Violence is often part of neglect and carelessness toward children, and it often also concerns their personal hygiene and health care. Aim of our study was to verify the hypothesis that dental neglect, intended as a specific form of neglect, is often associated to other types of neglect, and therefore it could represent an important sign in identifying childhood abuse and neglect situations. These were investigated through the comparison between a group of children with psychological disorder and a control group, as far as their dental health is concerned. Our results indicate that the abused children show: a significantly higher dental <e>plaque</e> index (p=.02); a higher gingival inflammation (p =.2); a higher number of untreated decays (p=.004); more evidences of neglect (p = .0002). Additionally, the abused subjects were less cooperative during dental visits (p=.0005). Our data support the hypothesis that the abused children in our group are, both under the hygiene point of view and access to treatment, more neglected by their caregivers.",M2
20059421,"Relationships among gingival crevicular fluid biomarkers, clinical parameters of periodontal disease, and the subgingival microbiota.BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to measure levels of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) biomarkers and subgingival bacterial species in periodontally healthy subjects and subjects with periodontitis to explore the relationships among these biomarkers, the subgingival microbiota, and the clinical parameters of periodontal disease. METHODS: Clinical periodontal parameters were measured at six sites per tooth in 20 subjects with periodontitis and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. GCF and subgingival <e>plaque</e> samples were obtained from the mesio-buccal aspect of every tooth. GCF levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-8 and matrix metalloproteinase 8 were measured using checkerboard immunoblotting, and the levels of 40 bacterial taxa were quantified using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. A subset of  clinically healthy  sites from each group was analyzed separately. The significance of the differences between groups was determined using the unpaired t test or the Mann-Whitney test. Correlations among immunologic, microbiologic, and clinical data were determined using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: There were positive correlations among mean clinical parameters, mean levels of the three biomarkers, and the proportions of orange and red complex species (P &lt;0.05). Clinically healthy sites from subjects with periodontitis had higher levels of IL-1beta and IL-8 and higher proportions of orange and red complex species (P &lt;0.05) than clinically healthy sites from periodontally healthy subjects. Red complex species were positively associated with the expression of all biomarkers (P &lt;0.05), whereas purple and yellow complex species had negative correlations with IL-1beta and IL-8 (P &lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically healthy sites from subjects with periodontitis have higher levels of GCF biomarkers and periodontal pathogens than clinically healthy sites from periodontally healthy subjects. Different microbial complexes demonstrated distinct associations with specific GCF biomarkers.",M2
20059420,"Subgingival <e>plaque</e> removal using a new air-polishing device.BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, patient acceptance, and short-term microbiologic effect of a new air-polishing device in subjects in maintenance care with residual pockets &gt; or =5 mm. METHODS: This was an examiner-masked, randomized, split-mouth clinical trial. A new disposable nozzle, allowing the subgingival application of amino acid glycine powder at a limited pressure, was compared to scaling and root planing (SRP) in 50 subjects with residual pockets during the maintenance phase. After removing supragingival deposits, the spray was applied for 4 to 5 seconds in all sites &gt; or =5 mm in the test quadrant, whereas SRP was used in the control quadrant. Microbiologic samples were taken from one treated test and one control site 2 days before and 7 days after treatment. Total bacterial counts and the counts of six periodontal pathogens were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: No adverse event was noted in any subject for the test or control treatment. Using a visual analog scale, the patients perceived the test treatment to be significantly less painful/uncomfortable than the hand instrumentation (P &lt;0.001). Significantly less time was used by the operator for the test procedure (P &lt;0.001). The reduction in bleeding on probing was significant for the treated sites in the test and control quadrants (P = 0.019 and P &lt;0.001, respectively), but traditional SRP reduced the bleeding tendency significantly more than air polishing (P = 0.045). The differences in the total bacterial load and the counts of six periodontal pathogens between the test and control sites did not reach statistical significance. The longitudinal reduction was significant in control sites for total bacteria load (P &lt;0.001), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P = 0.01), Treponema denticola (P &lt;0.001), and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) (P &lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: Subgingival air polishing with a new device was safe (no adverse events were noted), perceived to be more acceptable by the patients, and was more time-efficient than SRP; however, on a microbiologic level, it was not superior to conventional SRP.",M2
20059417,"Site-specific gingival bleeding on probing in a steady-state <e>plaque</e> environment: influence of polymorphisms in the interleukin-1 gene cluster.BACKGROUND: We previously reported a high prevalence of a combination of alleles 2 at positions interleukin (IL)-1A(-889) and IL-1B(+3954) in an Arabic population with gingivitis. In a steady state, the proportion of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP) was consistently reduced. The aim of the present study is to expand this observation by considering the site level. METHODS: Fifty healthy non-smoking volunteers, 19 to 28 years of age, participated in this study. Clinical examinations included probing depth, BOP, plaque index (PI), and calculus. Examinations were repeated after 2 and 4 weeks, and subjects were advised not to change oral hygiene habits. Polymorphisms in the IL-1 gene cluster were assessed using a reverse hybridization assay. RESULTS: Twenty-six subjects (52%) carried alleles 2 at positions IL-1A(-889) and IL-1B(+3954) and were designated genotype positive. In multivariate multilevel models of BOP, bleeding tendency in subjects with positive IL-1 genotype was only reduced at sites with PI 0 (odds ratio of 0.98, 0.65, and 0.56 at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks, respectively; chi(2)((3)) = 11.946; P = 0.008) or 1 (chi(2)((3)) = 6.027; P = 0.110). A decreased bleeding tendency at certain tooth types in subjects who were IL-1 positive was largely related to the relative cleanliness of these areas. Random parts of the models revealed very low biserial correlations of 0.13 to 0.15 at the site level, whereas correlations were considerably higher (0.76 to 0.83) at the subject level. CONCLUSION: Multilevel modeling of site-specific data yielded new information about the influence of the IL-1 genotype in plaque-induced gingivitis.",M2
20043549,"Gingival health and relapse tendency: a prospective study of two types of lower fixed retainers.BACKGROUND: Different types and diameters of wire are used in bonded lingual retainers. Some clinicians bond a small diameter multistrand wire to each tooth, while other clinicians bond a large diameter wire to the lingual surfaces of the lower canines. AIM: To compare the gingival health, <e>plaque</e> accumulation, tooth stability and integrity of multistrand wire and round wire bonded lingual retainers. METHODS: Sixty-two subjects, who had completed treatment and who required fixed retention for the lower anterior segment, were assigned to either the Round wire retainer group or the Multistrand wire retainer group. In the Round wire retainer group, a 0.036 inch round, stainless steel wire was bonded to the lingual surfaces of both lower canines. The Multistrand retainer group had a 0.015 inch multistrand wire bonded to the lingual surfaces of all lower anterior teeth. At least 12 months after debonding, the subjects were recalled and the following variables were recorded: Oral Hygiene Index (OHI), Plaque Index (PI) of the lower anterior teeth, Gingival Index (GI) of the lower anterior teeth, Irregularity Index (IRI) of the lower anterior teeth, and the number of broken retainers. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the PI (p = 0.165) and GI (p = 0.150) of the two groups. More plaque was found on the distal surfaces of the lower anterior teeth in the group with multistrand wire retainers (p = 0.02). The lower anterior teeth were significantly more irregular in the group with round wire retainers compared to the group with multistrand wire retainers (p = 0.002). Although the multistrand wire retainers fractured more frequently than the round wire retainers the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.325). CONCLUSION: More plaque accumulated on the distal surfaces of the lower anterior teeth in subjects with multistrand wire retainers than in subjects with round wire retainers. Multistrand wire retainers were better at maintaining incisor alignment than single span, round wire retainers.",M2
20042742,"Specific Lactobacillus/Mutans Streptococcus co-aggregation.Selective interaction of mutans streptococci with benign bacteria could present an opportunity for their removal from the mouth without disruption of other oral flora. This study was conducted to find probiotic lactobacilli that could specifically co-aggregate in vitro with mutans streptococci, but not with other <e>plaque</e> commensals. A search of 624 lactobacilli among a large culture library revealed 6 strains, all classifiable as L. paracasei or L. rhamnosus, which met this criterion. Such novel, specific co-aggregation, however, was not a general characteristic of these species or the genus Lactobacillus. The co-aggregation by these specific lactobacilli was characterized as heat treatment (autoclaving)- and protease-resistant, lectin-independent, not inactivated by sugar substitutes, operational over a wide pH range, unaffected by whole saliva, but calcium-dependent. It is thus seen to present a potential strategy for in vivo alteration of plaque biofilm and caries.",M2
20034921,"Application of immunoassay for detection of Helicobacter pylori antigens in the dental <e>plaque</e>.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the viability of the commercial test currently used for detection of H. pylori antigens in the stool for detection of H. pylori antigens in dental plaque. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 164 dyspeptic patients entered the study; 95 H. pylori infected (positive result of at least 4 of 5 diagnostic tests: Campylobacter-like organisms test (CLO test), histology, culture, stool antigens, serology) and 69 noninfected (negative results of 4 diagnostic tests: CLO test, histology, culture, stool antigens). Dental plaque was collected from natural teeth of the patients and incubated in microaerophilic conditions for 72 hours before immunoassay. RESULTS: Experimental findings included that optimal dental plaque weight to perform the examination was over 2 mg and that preliminary incubation increased significantly the number of positive results (p&lt;0.002). It was also found that H. pylori antigens in the dental plaque were positive in 81.2% of infected and only 17.7% of non-infected subjects (p&lt;0.001), while the reproducibility of results was 95%. CONCLUSIONS: The immunoassay for detection of H. pylori antigens in the stool may be used, after minor adaptations (specifically pre-incubation in microaerophilic conditions) for H. pylori antigen detection in dental plaque.",M2
20023092,"Inhibitory effects of low-energy pulsed ultrasonic stimulation on cell surface protein antigen C through heat shock proteins GroEL and DnaK in Streptococcus mutans.This study concerns the use of low-energy pulsed ultrasound as nondestructive photodynamic antimicrobial therapy for controlling dental <e>plaque</e>. We examined the antibacterial and bactericidal effects of low-energy pulsed ultrasound on mutans streptococci and its inhibitory effects on bacterial cell adhesion of Streptococcus mutans. The results indicated weak antibacterial and bactericidal effects. However, ultrasonic stimulation for less than 20 min markedly decreased bacterial cell adhesion. To analyze the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect, we examined cell surface protein antigen C (PAc) and glucosyltransferase I (GTF-I) expression in S. mutans. The levels of PAc gene and protein expression were markedly decreased by ultrasonic stimulation for 20 min. However, no change in GTF-I expression was observed. The expression of stress response heat shock proteins GroEL and DnaK was also examined. GroEL and DnaK levels were significantly decreased by ultrasonic stimulation, and the expression of the PAc protein was also diminished upon the addition of GroEL or DnaK inhibitors without ultrasonic stimulation. These observations suggest that the expression of the PAc protein in S. mutans may be dependent on heat shock proteins. Thus, low-energy pulsed ultrasound decreases bacterial adhesion by the inhibitory effect on the PAc protein and heat shock protein expression and may be useful as photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy in controlling dental plaque.",M2
20020077,"The effect of the surface roughness of porcelain on the adhesion of oral Streptococcus mutans.AIM: Dental <e>plaque</e> has a harmful influence on periodontal tissue. When a porcelain restoration is fabricated and refinishing of the glazed surface is inevitable, the increase in surface roughness facilitates the adhesion of plaque and its components. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of surface roughness of glazed or polished porcelain on the adhesion of oral Streptococcus mutans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 80 metal-ceramic specimens were prepared in the form of disks from two porcelain materials and divided into four groups according to the method of surface finishing. Surface roughness values (Ra-microm) for all specimens were recorded using a profilometer. S. mutans bacteria were isolated from saliva and all specimens were inoculated in test tubes containing a bacterial suspension allowing adhesion of the microorganisms to the specimens to occur. After incubation for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, the specimens were transferred to a sterile saline solution and an inoculum of 0.1 ml from each selected dilution was spread on the selective medium, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (MSB). Bacterial counts, expressed in colony forming unit (CFU) taking into consideration the dilution factor, were recorded. RESULTS: There was significant correlation (p&lt;0.05) between surface roughness values (Ra-microm) and the amount of bacterial adhesion (CFU x 10(3)). The glazed surface was the smoothest and exhibited the least amount of bacterial adhesion. CONCLUSION: A positive correlation between surface roughness and the amount of S. mutans adhesion was observed. The glazed porcelain surface was considered more biocompatible than other methods of porcelain surface finishing. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Chairside adjustments of the cervical contour or occlusal surface of porcelain restorations are sometimes necessary before or after cementation. Ideally, an uncemented restoration should be returned to the laboratory for reglazing after all adjustments have been completed. It is important to evaluate various polishing procedures used for these adjusted surfaces to achieve a finished surface that as closely as possible approximates the quality of glazed porcelain.",M2
20016176,"Effect of various rinsing protocols after use of amine fluoride/stannous fluoride toothpaste on the bacterial composition of dental <e>plaque</e>.This clinical study evaluated the effect of different oral hygiene protocols on the bacterial composition of dental plaque. After a 2-week period of using fluoride-free toothpaste, 30 participants followed three 1-week experimental protocols, each followed by 2-week fluoride-free washout periods in a randomized crossover examiner-blind controlled trial. The 1-week experimental protocols comprised the use of AmF/SnF(2) toothpaste twice daily, after which participants either (1) rinsed with tap water, (2) did not rinse but only spat out the toothpaste, or (3) rinsed with an AmF/SnF(2) mouthwash. In the fluoride-free washout periods, the participants brushed their teeth with fluoride-free toothpaste without further instructions. Six hours after the last brushing (+/- rinsing) of each period, buccal plaque samples in the upper molar region were taken. The microbiota composition of the plaque samples was analyzed by checkerboard DNA:DNA hybridization. A statistically significant reduction was found in the total amount of DNA of the 39 major plaque species measured, and in the proportions of some acid-producing bacterial strains after the period having used the AmF/SnF(2) toothpaste + AmF/SnF(2) mouthrinsing. The results indicate that using the AmF/SnF(2) toothpaste and rinse combination could result in plaque of lower cariogenicity.",M2
20016175,"Six months of daily high-dose xylitol in high-risk schoolchildren: a randomized clinical trial on <e>plaque</e> pH and salivary mutans streptococci.A randomized clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effect of daily high-dose xylitol chewing gum on plaque pH and salivary mutans streptococci (MS) in a sample of schoolchildren at high risk of caries. The study was performed on 204 subjects (acceptance rate 88.3%). Inclusion criteria were: &gt;1 and &lt;4 carious lesions, and a salivary MS concentration &gt;10(5) CFU/ml. Subjects were randomly assigned to the xylitol or control group. Study design included one examination at baseline (t(0)), one after 3 months of chewing (t(1)), one after 6 months of chewing (t(2)) and the last 3 months after the end of chewing period (t(3)). Plaque pH was assessed using the MicroTouch technique, following a sucrose challenge. The area under the curve (AUC(5.7) and AUC(6.2)) was recorded. Whole saliva was collected in sterile vials and MS CFU/ml were counted. Data were analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA. The main result was that plaque acidogenicity was reduced in both groups. The differences between treatments were statistically significant both for plaque pH and MS concentration; the interaction term for treatment and time was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01). At t(2), the xylitol group children with a salivary MS concentration &gt;10(5) and those with &lt; or =10(5) showed significantly lower AUC(5.7) and AUC(6.2) values than the control group. These results suggest that the long-term use of high-dose non-sucrose chewing gums had beneficial effects on plaque pH, and that this effect was statistically greater when using xylitol chewing gums, both on plaque pH and MS salivary concentration.",M2
20011757,"Clinical effects of interdental cleansing on supragingival biofilm formation and development of experimental gingivitis.PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to test the effects of interdental cleansing with dental floss on supragingival biofilm removal in natural dentition during a 3-week period of experimental biofilm accumulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was performed as a single-blind, parallel, randomised, controlled clinical trial using the experimental gingivitis model (Löe et al, 1965). Thirty-two students were recruited and assigned to one of the following experimental or control groups: Group A used a fluoride-containing dentifrice (NaF dentifrice) on a toothbrush for 60 s twice a day, Group B used an unwaxed dental floss twice a day, Group C used a waxed dental floss twice a day in every interproximal space and Group D rinsed twice a day for 60 s with drinking water (control). RESULTS: During 21 days of abolished oral hygiene, the groups developed various amounts of <e>plaque</e> and gingivitis. Neither of the cleansing protocols alone allowed the prevention of gingivitis development. Toothbrushing alone yielded better outcomes than did any of the flossing protocols. Interdental cleansing with a waxed floss had better biofilm removal effects than with unwaxed floss. CONCLUSIONS: Toothbrushing without interdental cleansing using dental floss and interdental cleansing alone cannot prevent the development of gingivitis.",M2
20004439,"Pre-operative dental brushing can reduce the risk of postoperative pneumonia in esophageal cancer patients.BACKGROUND: The presence of pathogens in dental <e>plaque</e> is a risk factor associated with postoperative pneumonia in esophageal cancer patients. The effectiveness of pre-operative dental brushing to decrease the risk of postoperative pneumonia in esophageal cancer patients was evaluated prospectively. METHODS: A total of 86 thoracic esophageal cancer patients who underwent an esophagectomy were investigated. Patients were divided into 2 groups: the control group (41 patients) and the pre-operative dental brushing group (45 patients). The patients in the brushing group were assigned to brush their teeth 5 times a day. After the operation, the frequency of postoperative pneumonia and need for tracheostomy for pulmonary treatment was calculated. RESULTS: Postoperative pneumonia was decreased markedly from 32% to 9% (P = .013), and the frequency of postoperative pneumonia requiring tracheostomy decreased from 12% to 0% in the dental brushing group, respectively. Limiting the patients who had positive pathogenic bacteria in their dental plaque on their admission, the frequency of postoperative pneumonia was decreased from 71% (5 of 7 patients) in the control group to 17% (2 of 12 patients) in the dental brushing group (P = .045). CONCLUSION: Frequent pre-operative dental brushing is performed easily and seems to prevent postoperative pneumonia in esophageal cancer patients.",M2
20003944,"The synergistic antimicrobial effect by mechanical agitation and two chlorhexidine preparations on biofilm bacteria.INTRODUCTION: Irrigation of the root canal with antibacterial solutions is considered an essential part of root canal treatment in endodontics. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether mechanical agitation (ultrasonic or sonic) improves the effectiveness of chlorhexidine against biofilm bacteria in vitro. METHODS: Collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (CHA) disks were exposed to dispersed subgingival <e>plaque</e> for 3 weeks at 37 degrees C. The multispecies biofilms established were subjected for 1 and 3 minutes to CHX-Plus (Vista Dental Products, Racine, WI) and 2% chlorhexidine (CHX), with or without mechanical agitation. After treatment, the amount of dead bacteria in biofilms was analyzed by viability staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The morphology of biofilms, with or without mechanical agitation, was also examined by CLSM. RESULTS: The structure of the biofilm did not show any obvious change when the solutions surrounding the biofilm were exposed to continuous ultrasonic or sonic agitation. The combined use of mechanical agitation and chlorhexidine had a more pronounced antimicrobial effect against the biofilms than either one alone. Sonic activation (EndoActivator; Advanced Endodontics, Santa Barbara, CA) showed the highest levels of bactericidal activity with CHX-Plus after both exposure times. The proportion of killed bacteria also depended on the type of irrigant (p &lt; 0.001) and the time of exposure (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The low-intensity ultrasonic or sonic agitation that does not disrupt biofilm or disperse the biofilm bacteria improves the action of disinfectants against biofilm bacteria.",M2

19994563,"Periodontal health status in Swedish adolescents: an epidemiological, cross-sectional study.The aim of this epidemiological survey was to analyze the periodontal conditions of 19-year old individuals in two rural county areas, i.e. Fyrbodal and Skaraborg, Västra Götaland, Sweden, with special reference to gender and socioeconomic grouping. A randomized sample of 506 individuals (Fyrbodal 250 and Skaraborg 256 individuals, respectively) was clinically examined with regard to oral hygiene, gingivitis, periodontal pockets and gingival recession. Bitewing radiographs were used for assessment of alveolar bone level (ABL) and dental calculus. A questionnaire-based interview regarding oral hygiene habits was included. A majority of the subjects (76%) claimed to brush their teeth at least twice a day, while interdental hygiene means were used daily by 4%. The subjects showed a mean <e>plaque</e> score of 47% and a gingivitis score of 56%. Forty-six % of the adolescents had a plaque score of &gt; or = 50%, whereas the corresponding figure for gingivitis was 62%. The subjects had on average 5.5 teeth with facial gingival recession. The mean prevalence of sites with probing depth (PPD) of &gt; or = 4 mm was 8, out of which 99% were located at proximal sites. A radiographic bone level of &gt; 2 mm was observed at on average 0.4 teeth per subject. Logistic regression analyses revealed that gender (males) and county area (Fyrbodal) were significant factors for a high plaque and gingivitis score. There was no significant difference in periodontal conditions in relation to socio-economic grouping. In conclusion, the survey revealed higher prevalence of plaque and gingivitis among male than female adolescents, but no differences between socioeconomic groups.",M2

Microbiologic analysis of pooled samples from subgingival <e>plaque</e> was performed by using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for A. actinomycetemcomitans. In patients who tested positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans, serotypes (a through f) were determined by nucleic acid-based methods. RESULTS: The prevalence of patients who tested positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans with the real-time PCR was comparable in both groups (Germans: 27.0%; Koreans: 22.2%). In German patients, the serotypes detected most frequently were b (33.3%), c (25.0%), and a (20.8%), whereas in Korean patients, the serotype distribution was different, with serotypes c (61.9%) and d (19.0%) accounting for &gt;80% of the complete serotype spectrum. CONCLUSION: Even if the percentage of patients who tested positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans was identical in patients with generalized aggressive and severe chronic periodontitis and different ethnic backgrounds, the distribution of A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes may exhibit marked differences.",M2
19961381,"Gingival inflammation and interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in gingival crevicular fluid during the menstrual cycle.BACKGROUND: Hormonal changes during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause may impact periodontal tissues by altering the host response. There are only a few studies that examined gingival changes during the menstrual cycle. This longitudinal and prospective study aims to investigate clinical and laboratory markers of gingival inflammation in women at different phases during their menstrual cycles. METHODS: Twenty-seven females were included in this study. Subjects were given oral hygiene instructions before the study, and their <e>plaque</e> index scores were recorded once a week for 2 months. The duration and regularity of the menstrual cycle were also checked at the same time. The gingival index and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded. Probing depths were measured to assess the periodontal condition of the subjects. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was collected to analyze the levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha on the first menstruation day (MD), estimated ovulation day (OD), and estimated predominant progesterone secretion day (PgD). These exact menstrual cycle days were determined according to serum progesterone and estradiol levels. RESULTS: BOP and IL-1beta levels in GCF showed significant increases from the MD to PgD under optimal plaque control. Among the 12 subjects that had premenstrual symptoms, six subjects reported oral complaints during the premenstrual period, whereas apthous lesions were more frequent during the menstruation period. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the fluctuation of sex steroid hormones impact gingival inflammation during menstruation.",M2
19958441,"Pro-inflammatory biomarkers during experimental gingivitis in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a proof-of-concept study.AIM: To compare gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) biomarker levels and microbial distribution in <e>plaque</e> biofilm (SP) samples for subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) versus healthy subjects without diabetes during experimental gingivitis (EG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of nine T1DM patients and nine healthy controls of age and gender similar to the T1DM patients were monitored for 35 days during EG. Hygiene practices were stopped for 3 weeks, and GCF, SP, plaque index (PI) and gingival index were determined. IL-1beta, IL-8, MMP-8 and MMP-9 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and SP samples were assessed by DNA-DNA hybridization for a panel of 40 subgingival microbial species. RESULTS: IL-1beta levels in T1DM patients were elevated compared with healthy individuals, and showed differences between groups at 7-21 days while healthy patients showed IL-1beta increases from baseline to 14-21 days (p&lt;0.05). Differences were observed in MMP-9 levels between patients with and without T1DM at 7-14 days (p&lt;0.05). Orange complex species and PI measurements displayed a superior correlation with biomarker levels when compared with other complexes or clinical measurements during EG. CONCLUSIONS: The mean GCF biomarker levels for IL-1beta and MMP-8 were most significantly elevated in T1DM subjects compared with healthy individuals during EG, not resulting from differences in the mean PI or microbial composition.",M2
19955272,"Drinking habits are associated with changes in the dental <e>plaque</e> microbial community.Caries and gingivitis are the most prevalent oral infectious diseases of humans and are due to the accumulation of dental plaque (a microbial biofilm) on the tooth surface and at the gingival margin, respectively. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that many natural components of foods and beverages inhibit the adhesion of and/or exert activity against oral bacteria. These biological activities have mainly been attributed to the polyphenol fraction. In order to explore the possibility that diet can alter the dental plaque community, in this study we evaluated the composition of the microbiota of supra- and subgingival plaque samples collected from 75 adult subjects with different drinking habits (drinkers of coffee, red wine, or water for at least 2 years) by analyzing the microbial population through the separation of PCR-amplified fragments using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique. The mean numbers of bands of the DGGE profiles from all three categories were evaluated. There were no significant differences between the two kinds of plaque collected from the control group (water drinkers), and this group showed the highest number of bands (supragingival plaque, 18.98 +/- 3.16 bands; subgingival plaque, 18.7 +/- 3.23 bands). The coffee and wine drinker groups generated the lowest numbers of bands for both supragingival plaque (coffee drinkers, 8.25 +/- 3.53 bands; wine drinkers, 7.93 +/- 2.55 bands) and subgingival plaque (coffee drinkers, 8.3 +/- 3.03 bands; wine drinkers, 7.65 +/- 1.68 bands). The differences between coffee drinkers or wine drinkers and the control group (water drinkers) were statistically significant. A total of 34 microorganisms were identified, and the frequency of their distribution in the three subject categories was analyzed. A greater percentage of subjects were positive for facultative aerobes when supragingival plaque was analyzed, while anaerobes were more frequent in subgingival plaque samples. It is noteworthy that the frequency of identification of anaerobes was significantly reduced when the frequencies for coffee and wine drinkers were compared with the frequencies for subjects in the control group. The DGGE profiles of the organisms in both plaque samples from all groups were generated and were used to construct dendrograms. A number of distinct clusters of organisms from water, coffee, and wine drinkers were formed. The clustering of some of the DGGE results into cohort-specific clusters implies similarities in the microbiotas within these groups and relevant differences in the microbiotas between cohorts. This supports the notion that the drinking habits of the subjects may influence the microbiota at both the supragingival and the subgingival levels.",M2
19953806,"Oral hygiene indirect instruction and periodic reinforcements: effects on index <e>plaque</e> in schoolchildren.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the indirect instruction and the influence of the periodic reinforcement on the plaque index in schoolchildren. Forty schoolchildren aged from 7 to 9 years old were selected from a public school. After determining the initial O'Leary Plaque Index all schoolchildren were submitted to a program for oral hygiene through indirect instruction - The Smiling Robot . The schoolchildren were divided into 2 groups: with and without motivation reinforcement. The index plaque exam was performed in both groups after 30, 60 and 90 days of the educational program. Comparing the groups, the plaque index decreasing could be observed in the group with reinforcement with statistically significant difference. For the group with reinforcement, statistically significant difference among the evaluations was found. For the group without reinforcement, significant decrease in the plaque index was found after 30 days when compared to the first, third and fourth evaluations. The indirect instruction with  The Smiling Robot  promoted a positive initial impact on the decrease of plaque index in the schoolchildren. The periodic reinforcements showed more suitable results and significant reduction of the plaque index in the course of the evaluations.",M2
19953805,"Caries experience and oral hygiene status of children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the caries experience and oral hygiene status of children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and was compared with that of non-ADHD children. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 80 children, including 40 ADHD and 40 non-ADHD children were included in the study. A visual dental examination for dental caries was performed and oral hygiene status of these children was determined. The parent/guardian completed a questionnaire concerning the child's behavior followed by questionnaire to the child regarding oral hygiene practices and food habits. RESULTS: Student-t test and chi-square test showed that children with ADHD had significantly higher defs score, mean <e>plaque</e> score in compared to that of non-ADHD children. Statistical significant differences were also found out in relation with frequency of tooth brushing and consumption of sugary food among the children suffering from ADHD. CONCLUSION: Caries prevalence in the primary dentition is increased in the children suffering from ADHD due to poor oral hygiene and increased consumption of sugary foods.",M2
19948944,"Xylitol gum and maternal transmission of mutans streptococci.An important caries prevention strategy for children includes measures to interfere with transmission of mutans streptococci (MS). This study confirmed the effectiveness of maternal early exposure to xylitol chewing gum on mother-child transmission of MS. After screening, 107 pregnant women with high salivary MS were randomized into two groups: xylitol gum (Xylitol; n = 56) and no gum (Control; n = 51) groups. Maternal chewing started at the sixth month of pregnancy and terminated 13 months later in the Xylitol group. Outcome measures were the presence of MS in saliva or <e>plaque</e> of the children until age 24 months. The Xylitol-group children were significantly less likely to show MS colonization than Control-group children aged 9-24 months. The Control-group children acquired MS 8.8 months earlier than those in the Xylitol group, suggesting that maternal xylitol gum chewing in Japan shows beneficial effects similar to those demonstrated in Nordic countries.",M2
19945074,"Update on early childhood caries since the Surgeon General's Report.The 2000 Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health included a limited discussion of the condition known as early childhood caries. Because of its high prevalence, its impact on young children's quality of life and potential for increasing their risk of caries in the permanent dentition, early childhood caries is arguably one of the most serious and costly health conditions among young children. A necessary first step in preventing dental caries in preschool children is understanding and evaluating the child's caries risk factors. Previous caries experience and white spot lesions should automatically classify a preschool child as high risk for caries. Microbial factors, such as presence of visible <e>plaque</e> and tests that identify a child as having high levels of mutans streptococci, also predict caries in young children. Frequency of sugar consumption, enamel developmental defects, social factors such as socioeconomic status, psychosocial factors, and being an ethnic minority also have shown to be relevant in determining caries risk. On the basis of this knowledge of specific risk factors for an individual, different preventive strategies and different intensities of preventive therapies can be implemented. Caries preventive strategies in preschool children include fluoride therapy, such as supervised tooth brushing with a fluoridated dentifrice, systemic fluoride supplement to children who live in a nonfluoridated area and who are at risk for caries, and professional topical fluoride with fluoride varnish. There is emerging evidence that intensive patient counseling or motivational interviews with parents to change specific behaviors may reduce caries prevalence in their children. Findings regarding antimicrobial interventions, efforts to modify diets, and traditional dental health education are less consistent.",M2
19942865,"Are alcohol containing mouthwashes safe?Alcohol (ethanol) is a constituent of many proprietary mouthwashes. Some studies have shown that regular use of such mouthwashes can increase the risk of developing oral cancer. Recently, the evidence has been reviewed by two separate authors. The conclusions from these reviews are conflicting. In this paper, we reconsider the epidemiological evidence linking alcohol containing mouthwashes with an increased risk of oral cancer. The evidence is considered in term of sample size, strength of association, confounding variables and data collection. In addition, clinical studies comparing alcohol versus non-alcohol mouthwashes are evaluated. The evidence suggests that the alcohol component of mouthwashes affords little additional benefit to the other active ingredients in terms of <e>plaque</e> and gingivitis control. In view of this outcome and the hypothetical risk of oral cancer, it would seem prudent that members of the dental team advise their patients accordingly.",M2
19939349,"Prevalence of potential bacterial respiratory pathogens in the oral cavity of hospitalised individuals.OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of oral colonisation by bacterial respiratory pathogens in hospitalised patients. METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing myocardium revascularisation surgery were evaluated. At baseline (pre-operative phase), full-mouth clinical periodontal assessment was performed. Saliva and biofilm samples were obtained from subjects at baseline and at the post-operative phase, after orotracheal extubation. DNA was extracted from samples and species of Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus and Dialister pneumosintes were detected by PCR or culture (for staphylococci isolates). RESULTS: Most of the subjects were males, with history of hypertension and smoking. Thirteen were edentulous (ED) and 17 were dentate (DE), with moderate chronic periodontitis. The most prevalent bacteria in saliva were Staphylococcus spp. (85.7%), Pseudomonas spp. (83.8%), and Acinetobacter spp. (53.3%). There was a trend for D. pneumosintes to be more frequently detected in DE (43.7%) than ED (11.5%) patients. In <e>plaque</e> samples, DE with &gt;14 teeth showed a higher prevalence of Pseudomonas spp. (100%) than individuals with &lt; or =14 teeth (69.1%; p=0.048). Conversely, P. aeruginosa was more prevalent in subjects with fewer teeth (35.5%) than with &gt;14 teeth (5.7%; p=0.037). All staphylococci isolates were coagulase-negative, and about 11% were positive for the mecA gene. These mecA-positive isolates showed a tendency to increase in all samples, whereas P. aeruginosa reduced after surgery. A strong correlation between the presence of Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. was observed (rho=0.886, p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The oral cavity of hospitalised patients harbours high frequencies of bacterial respiratory pathogens, supporting its potential role as a reservoir for these species.",M2
19938252,"Effectiveness of oral self-care among adult Gullah-speaking African Americans with diabetes.We investigated the efficacy of <e>plaque</e> removal after an oral self-care demonstration among adult Gullah-speaking African Americans with diabetes. Fifty-four adults with diabetes completed an observed, uninstructed oral self-care demonstration with their normal mode of oral self-care. Before and after the oral self-care demonstration, the plaque levels of six test teeth were assessed using the Plaque Index. The mean percentage of plaque removal after the oral self-care demonstration was 27.4%. The mandibular teeth and the lingual surface had less plaque removal compared with the maxillary teeth and buccal surfaces. Only approximately 10% of participants achieved 50% or more plaque removal after the oral self-care demonstration. Thus, the majority of the participants did not achieve an acceptable level of plaque removal. Dental health professionals should emphasize better oral home care for people with diabetes and teach them how to access the lingual surfaces, especially of the mandibular teeth.",M2
19938251,"Dental health of patients with Parkinson's disease in Iceland.The oral and dental health of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been well documented and the findings are conflicting. Patients with PD were invited to take part in a clinical and radiographic examination together with a comparison control group of persons who were a spouse or family member. Subjects (n = 67) and controls (n = 55) were examined and compared. Subjects with PD had more missing teeth, caries, dental <e>plaque</e>, and poorer periodontal health. Counts of cariogenic bacteria in saliva were significantly higher for subjects with PD. They did not consume more sweets or sugar, did not brush less frequently, used dental floss more than controls, and visited the dentist at least as often. Salivary flow levels were comparable between subjects with PD and controls. The lack of muscular control may explain the poorer oral health of patients with PD. Dentists and patients with PD may be reluctant to embark on complex dental procedures, and this may explain the increased number of missing teeth in persons with PD in this study.",M2
19930091,"Dual effect of statin medication on the periodontium.AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between statin medication and periodontal infection in an adult population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was based on a subpopulation of the Health 2000 Survey, which included dentate non-diabetic, non-rheumatic subjects who did not smoke, aged 40-69 years (n=2032). The main outcome variable was the number of teeth with periodontal pockets of 4 mm or more. Statin medication was categorized in two ways: firstly, subjects with statin medication of some sort (n=134) versus those with none, and secondly, subjects taking either simvastatin (n=58), atorvastatin (n=38), some other statin (n=38) or no statin medication. Relative risks (RR) were estimated using negative binomial and Poisson regression models. RESULTS: We found a weak negative association between statin medication and periodontal infection among subjects with dental <e>plaque</e> or gingival bleeding. Among subjects with no gingival bleeding, statin medication was found to be associated with an increased likelihood of having deepened periodontal pockets. CONCLUSION: Statin medication appears to have an effect on the periodontium that is dependent on the inflammatory condition of the periodontium. More evidence is needed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the effects of statins.",M2
19929953,"Detection of periodontal bacterial DNA in serum and synovial fluid in refractory rheumatoid arthritis patients.AIM: To identify periodontal bacterial DNA (PBDNA) by PCR in subgingival dental <e>plaque</e> (SDP), serum and synovial fluid (SF) of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with periodontal disease (PD) patients and to explore the possible PBDNA transport pathways from mouth to joints. METHODS: This cross-sectional prolective study involved 19 subjects with RA and PD. Informed consent, health and dental questionnaires were obtained. SDP, SF and serum samples were obtained, and leucocytes were isolated from blood. DNA was extracted and PCR assays to detect main PD species were carried out. Cultures on agar plates and broth, from each sample, were performed. RESULTS: Hundred percentage of patients showed PBDNA in SDP and SF and 83.5% in serum. Prevotella intermedia (89.4% and 73.6%) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (57.8% and 42.1%) were the species most frequently detected in SDP and SF, respectively. In SDP, 4.05 different bacterial species were found followed by 1.19 in serum and 2.26 in SF. Culture onto agar plates and broth did not show any bacterial growth, leucocytes were not positive to PBDNA by PCR. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that PBDNA could have a role on the RA aetiology. The possible pathway of transport of PBDNA from mouth to joints could be via the free form of DNA.",M2
19918089,"Oral biofilms: emerging concepts in microbial ecology.Oral biofilms develop under a range of different conditions and different environments. This review will discuss emerging concepts in microbial ecology and how they relate to oral biofilm development and the treatment of oral diseases. Clues to how oral biofilms develop may lie in other complex systems, such as interactions between host and gut microbiota, and even in factors that affect biofilm development on leaf surfaces. Most of the conditions under which oral biofilms develop are tightly linked to the overall health and biology of the host. Advances in molecular techniques have led to a greater appreciation of the diversity of human microbiota, the extent of interactions with the human host, and how that relates to inter-individual variation. As a consequence, <e>plaque</e> development may no longer be thought of as a generic process, but rather as a highly individualized process, which has ramifications for the treatment of the diseases it causes.",M2
19905954,"Hydrogen sulfide production from cysteine and homocysteine by periodontal and oral bacteria.BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide is one of the predominant volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) produced by oral bacteria. This study developed and evaluated a system for detecting hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria. METHODS: L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (METase) and beta carbon-sulfur (beta C-S) lyase were used to degrade homocysteine and cysteine, respectively, to produce hydrogen sulfide. Enzymatic reactions resulting in hydrogen sulfide production were assayed by reaction with bismuth trichloride, which forms a black precipitate when mixed with hydrogen sulfide. The enzymatic activities of various oral bacteria that result in hydrogen sulfide production and the capacity of bacteria from periodontal sites to form hydrogen sulfide in reaction mixtures containing L-cysteine or DL-homocysteine were assayed. RESULTS: With L-cysteine as the substrate, Streptococcus anginosus FW73 produced the most hydrogen sulfide, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 33277 and W83 and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 produced approximately 35% of the amount produced by the P. gingivalis strains. Finally, the hydrogen sulfide found in subgingival <e>plaque</e> was analyzed. Using bismuth trichloride, the hydrogen sulfide produced by oral bacteria was visually detectable as a black precipitate. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria was easily analyzed using bismuth trichloride. However, further innovation is required for practical use.",M2
19936516,"Antiplaque and antigingivitis effect of Lippia Sidoides: a double-blind clinical study in humans.OBJECTIVES: The antiplaque and antigingivitis effect of Lippia Sidoides (LS) was evaluated in this in vivo investigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three subjects participated in a cross-over, double-blind clinical study, using 21-day partial-mouth experimental model of gingivitis. A toothshield was constructed for each volunteer, avoiding the brushing of the 4 experimental posterior teeth in the lower left quadrant. The subjects were randomly assigned initially to use either the placebo gel (control group) or the test gel, containing 10% LS (test group). RESULTS: The clinical results showed statistically significant differences for <e>plaque</e> index (PLI) (p&lt;0.01) between days 0 and 21 in both groups, however only the control group showed statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.01) for the bleeding (IB) and gingival (GI) index within the experimental period of 21 days. On day 21, the test group presented significantly better results than the control group with regard to the GI (p&lt;0.05).

19930092,"The effectiveness of an individually tailored oral health educational programme on oral hygiene behaviour in patients with periodontal disease: a blinded randomized-controlled clinical trial (one-year follow-up).AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of an individually tailored oral health educational programme for oral hygiene self-care in patients with chronic periodontitis compared with the standard treatment. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A randomized, evaluator-blinded, controlled trial with two different active treatments were used with 113 subjects (60 females and 53 males) randomly allocated to an experimental or a control group. The individually tailored oral health educational programme was based on cognitive behavioural principles and the individual tailoring for each participant was based on participants' thoughts, intermediate, and long-term goals, and oral health status. The effect of the programmes on gingivitis [gingival index (GI)], oral hygiene [<e>plaque</e> indices (PlI) and self-report], and participants' global rating of treatment was evaluated 3 and 12 months after oral health education and non-surgical treatment. RESULTS: Between baseline and the 12-month follow-up, the experimental group improved both GI and PlI more than the control group. The mean gain-score difference was 0.27 for global GI [99.2% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.39, p&lt;0.001] and 0.40 for proximal GI (99.2% CI: 0.27-0.53, p&lt;0.001). The mean gain-score difference was 0.16 for global PlI (99.2% CI: 0.03-0.30, p=0.001), and 0.26 for proximal PlI (99.2% CI: 0.10-0.43, p&lt;0.001). The subjects in the experimental group reported a higher frequency of daily inter-dental cleaning and were more certain that they could maintain the attained level of behaviour change. CONCLUSION: The individually tailored oral health educational programme was efficacious in improving long-term adherence to oral hygiene in periodontal treatment. The largest difference was for interproximal surfaces.",M2
