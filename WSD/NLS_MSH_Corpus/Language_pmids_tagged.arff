Part B: ChIP-chip data analysis.Genome-wide targets of chromatin-associated factors can be identified by a combination of chromatin-immunoprecipitation and oligonucleotide microarray hybridization. Genome-wide mircoarray data analysis represents a major challenge for the experimental biologist. This chapter introduces ChIPR, a package written in the R statistical programming <e>language</e> that facilitates the analysis of two-color microarrays from Roche-Nimblegen. The workflow of ChIPR is illustrated with sample data from Arabidopsis thaliana. However, ChIPR supports ChIP-chip data preprocessing, target identification, and cross-annotation of any species for which genome annotation data is available in GFF format. This chapter describes how to use ChIPR as a software tool without the requirement for programming skills in the R language.",M1

19969503,"Genomic Sequence Variation Markup <e>Language</e> (GSVML).OBJECTIVE: With the aim of making good use of internationally accumulated genomic sequence variation data, which is increasing rapidly due to the explosive amount of genomic research at present, the development of an interoperable data exchange format and its international standardization are necessary. Genomic Sequence Variation Markup Language (GSVML) will focus on genomic sequence variation data and human health applications, such as gene based medicine or pharmacogenomics. DESIGN AND METHOD: We developed GSVML through eight steps, based on case analysis and domain investigations. By focusing on the design scope to human health applications and genomic sequence variation, we attempted to eliminate ambiguity and to ensure practicability. We intended to satisfy the requirements derived from the use case analysis of human-based clinical genomic applications. Based on database investigations, we attempted to minimize the redundancy of the data format, while maximizing the data covering range. We also attempted to ensure communication and interface ability with other Markup Languages, for exchange of omics data among various omics researchers or facilities. The interface ability with developing clinical standards, such as the Health Level Seven Genotype Information model, was analyzed. RESULTS: We developed the human health-oriented GSVML comprising variation data, direct annotation, and indirect annotation categories; the variation data category is required, while the direct and indirect annotation categories are optional. The annotation categories contain omics and clinical information, and have internal relationships. For designing, we examined 6 cases for three criteria as human health application and 15 data elements for three criteria as data formats for genomic sequence variation data exchange. The data format of five international SNP databases and six Markup Languages and the interface ability to the Health Level Seven Genotype Model in terms of 317 items were investigated. CONCLUSION: GSVML was developed as a potential data exchanging format for genomic sequence variation data exchange focusing on human health applications. The international standardization of GSVML is necessary, and is currently underway. GSVML can be applied to enhance the utilization of genomic sequence variation data worldwide by providing a communicable platform between clinical and research applications.",M1

19963814,"SIMENGINE: a low-cost, high-performance platform for embedded biophysical simulations.Numerical simulations of dynamical systems are an obvious application of high-performance computing. Unfortunately, this application is underutilized because many modelers lack the technical expertise and financial resources to leverage high-performance computing hardware. Additionally, few platforms exist that can enable high-performance computing with real-time guarantees for inclusion into embedded systems--a prerequisite for working with medical devices. Here we introduce simEngine, a platform for numerical simulations of dynamical systems that reduces modelers' programming effort, delivers simulation speeds 10-100 times faster than a conventional microprocessor, and targets high-performance hardware suitable for real-time and embedded applications. This platform consists of a high-level mathematical <e>language</e> used to describe the simulation, a compiler/resource scheduler that generates the high-performance implementation of the simulation, and the high-performance hardware target. In this paper we present an overview of the platform, including a network-attached embedded computing device utilizing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) suitable for real-time, high-performance computing. We go on to describe an example model implementation to demonstrate the platform's performance and describe how future development will improve system performance.",M1

In particular, Biobase introduces an S4 class, the eSet, for high-dimensional assay data. Encapsulating the assay data as well as meta-data on the samples, features, and experiment in the eSet class definition ensures propagation of the relevant sample and feature meta-data throughout an analysis. Extending the eSet class promotes code reuse through inheritance as well as interoperability with other R packages and is less error-prone.

An extensible stylesheet <e>language</e> (XSL) stylesheet has been developed to transform measured data from the multi-sensor device to a valid PHMR document. The resulting documents are validated and evaluated using standard tools for processing extensible markup language (XML) documents.

19698094,"p3d--Python module for structural bioinformatics.ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: High-throughput bioinformatic analysis tools are needed to mine the large amount of structural data via knowledge based approaches. The development of such tools requires a robust interface to access the structural data in an easy way. For this the Python scripting <e>language</e> is the optimal choice since its philosophy is to write an understandable source code. RESULTS: p3d is an object oriented Python module that adds a simple yet powerful interface to the Python interpreter to process and analyse three dimensional protein structure files (PDB files). p3d's strength arises from the combination of a) very fast spatial access to the structural data due to the implementation of a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree, b) set theory and c) functions that allow to combine a and b and that use human readable language in the search queries rather than complex computer language. All these factors combined facilitate the rapid development of bioinformatic tools that can perform quick and complex analyses of protein structures. CONCLUSION: p3d is the perfect tool to quickly develop tools for structural bioinformatics using the Python scripting language.",M1

19606223,"PSPP: a protein structure prediction pipeline for computing clusters.BACKGROUND: Protein structures are critical for understanding the mechanisms of biological systems and, subsequently, for drug and vaccine design. Unfortunately, protein sequence data exceed structural data by a factor of more than 200 to 1. This gap can be partially filled by using computational protein structure prediction. While structure prediction Web servers are a notable option, they often restrict the number of sequence queries and/or provide a limited set of prediction methodologies. Therefore, we present a standalone protein structure prediction software package suitable for high-throughput structural genomic applications that performs all three classes of prediction methodologies: comparative modeling, fold recognition, and ab initio. This software can be deployed on a user's own high-performance computing cluster. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The pipeline consists of a Perl core that integrates more than 20 individual software packages and databases, most of which are freely available from other research laboratories. The query protein sequences are first divided into domains either by domain boundary recognition or Bayesian statistics. The structures of the individual domains are then predicted using template-based modeling or ab initio modeling. The predicted models are scored with a statistical potential and an all-atom force field. The top-scoring ab initio models are annotated by structural comparison against the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) fold database. Furthermore, secondary structure, solvent accessibility, transmembrane helices, and structural disorder are predicted. The results are generated in text, tab-delimited, and hypertext markup <e>language</e> (HTML) formats. So far, the pipeline has been used to study viral and bacterial proteomes. CONCLUSIONS: The standalone pipeline that we introduce here, unlike protein structure prediction Web servers, allows users to devote their own computing assets to process a potentially unlimited number of queries as well as perform resource-intensive ab initio structure prediction.",M1

19561017,"libAnnotationSBML: a library for exploiting SBML annotations.SUMMARY: The Systems Biology Markup <e>Language</e> (SBML) is an established community XML format for the markup of biochemical models. With the introduction of SBML level 2 version 3, specific model entities, such as species or reactions, can now be annotated using ontological terms. These annotations, which are encoded using the resource description framework (RDF), provide the facility to specify definite terms to individual components, allowing software to unambiguously identify such components and thus link the models to existing data resources. libSBML is an application programming interface library for the manipulation of SBML files. While libSBML provides the facilities for reading and writing such annotations from and to models, it is beyond the scope of libSBML to provide interpretation of these terms. The libAnnotationSBML library introduced here acts as a layer on top of libSBML linking SBML annotations to the web services that describe these ontological terms. Two applications that use this library are described: SbmlSynonymExtractor finds name synonyms of SBML model entities and SbmlReactionBalancer checks SBML files to determine whether specifed reactions are elementally balanced.",M1

19535415,"A programming <e>language</e> for composable DNA circuits.Recently, a range of information-processing circuits have been implemented in DNA by using strand displacement as their main computational mechanism. Examples include digital logic circuits and catalytic signal amplification circuits that function as efficient molecular detectors. As new paradigms for DNA computation emerge, the development of corresponding languages and tools for these paradigms will help to facilitate the design of DNA circuits and their automatic compilation to nucleotide sequences. We present a programming language for designing and simulating DNA circuits in which strand displacement is the main computational mechanism. The language includes basic elements of sequence domains, toeholds and branch migration, and assumes that strands do not possess any secondary structure. The language is used to model and simulate a variety of circuits, including an entropy-driven catalytic gate, a simple gate motif for synthesizing large-scale circuits and a scheme for implementing an arbitrary system of chemical reactions. The language is a first step towards the design of modelling and simulation tools for DNA strand displacement, which complements the emergence of novel implementation strategies for DNA computing.",M1
19531228,"FuGEFlow: data model and markup <e>language</e> for flow cytometry.BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry technology is widely used in both health care and research. The rapid expansion of flow cytometry applications has outpaced the development of data storage and analysis tools. Collaborative efforts being taken to eliminate this gap include building common vocabularies and ontologies, designing generic data models, and defining data exchange formats. The Minimum Information about a Flow Cytometry Experiment (MIFlowCyt) standard was recently adopted by the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry. This standard guides researchers on the information that should be included in peer reviewed publications, but it is insufficient for data exchange and integration between computational systems. The Functional Genomics Experiment (FuGE) formalizes common aspects of comprehensive and high throughput experiments across different biological technologies. We have extended FuGE object model to accommodate flow cytometry data and metadata. METHODS: We used the MagicDraw modelling tool to design a UML model (Flow-OM) according to the FuGE extension guidelines and the AndroMDA toolkit to transform the model to a markup language (Flow-ML). We mapped each MIFlowCyt term to either an existing FuGE class or to a new FuGEFlow class. The development environment was validated by comparing the official FuGE XSD to the schema we generated from the FuGE object model using our configuration. After the Flow-OM model was completed, the final version of the Flow-ML was generated and validated against an example MIFlowCyt compliant experiment description. RESULTS: The extension of FuGE for flow cytometry has resulted in a generic FuGE-compliant data model (FuGEFlow), which accommodates and links together all information required by MIFlowCyt. The FuGEFlow model can be used to build software and databases using FuGE software toolkits to facilitate automated exchange and manipulation of potentially large flow cytometry experimental data sets. Additional project documentation, including reusable design patterns and a guide for setting up a development environment, was contributed back to the FuGE project. CONCLUSION: We have shown that an extension of FuGE can be used to transform minimum information requirements in natural language to markup language in XML. Extending FuGE required significant effort, but in our experiences the benefits outweighed the costs. The FuGEFlow is expected to play a central role in describing flow cytometry experiments and ultimately facilitating data exchange including public flow cytometry repositories currently under development.",M1

19369220,"Towards programming <e>languages</e> for genetic engineering of living cells.Synthetic biology aims at producing novel biological systems to carry out some desired and well-defined functions. An ultimate dream is to design these systems at a high level of abstraction using engineering-based tools and programming languages, press a button, and have the design translated to DNA sequences that can be synthesized and put to work in living cells. We introduce such a programming language, which allows logical interactions between potentially undetermined proteins and genes to be expressed in a modular manner. Programs can be translated by a compiler into sequences of standard biological parts, a process that relies on logic programming and prototype databases that contain known biological parts and protein interactions. Programs can also be translated to reactions, allowing simulations to be carried out. While current limitations on available data prevent full use of the language in practical applications, the language can be used to develop formal models of synthetic systems, which are otherwise often presented by informal notations. The language can also serve as a concrete proposal on which future language designs can be discussed, and can help to guide the emerging standard of biological parts which so far has focused on biological, rather than logical, properties of parts.",M1
19368721,"Narrative-based computational modelling of the Gp130/JAK/STAT signalling pathway.BACKGROUND: Appropriately formulated quantitative computational models can support researchers in understanding the dynamic behaviour of biological pathways and support hypothesis formulation and selection by  in silico  experimentation. An obstacle to widespread adoption of this approach is the requirement to formulate a biological pathway as machine executable computer code. We have recently proposed a novel, biologically intuitive, narrative-style modelling <e>language</e> for biologists to formulate the pathway which is then automatically translated into an executable format and is, thus, usable for analysis via existing simulation techniques. RESULTS: Here we use a high-level narrative language in designing a computational model of the gp130/JAK/STAT signalling pathway and show that the model reproduces the dynamic behaviour of the pathway derived by biological observation. We then  experiment  on the model by simulation and sensitivity analysis to define those parameters which dominate the dynamic behaviour of the pathway. The model predicts that nuclear compartmentalisation and phosphorylation status of STAT are key determinants of the pathway and that alternative mechanisms of signal attenuation exert their influence on different timescales. CONCLUSION: The described narrative model of the gp130/JAK/STAT pathway represents an interesting case study showing how, by using this approach, researchers can model biological systems without explicitly dealing with formal notations and mathematical expressions (typically used for biochemical modelling), nevertheless being able to obtain simulation and analysis results. We present the model and the sensitivity analysis results we have obtained, that allow us to identify the parameters which are most sensitive to perturbations. The results, which are shown to be in agreement with existing mathematical models of the gp130/JAK/STAT pathway, serve us as a form of validation of the model and of the approach itself.",M1

19324681,"Methods for improving simulations of biological systems: systemic computation and fractal proteins.Modelling and simulation are becoming essential for new fields such as synthetic biology. Perhaps the most important aspect of modelling is to follow a clear design methodology that will help to highlight unwanted deficiencies. The use of tools designed to aid the modelling process can be of benefit in many situations. In this paper, the modelling approach called systemic computation (SC) is introduced. SC is an interaction-based <e>language</e>, which enables individual-based expression and modelling of biological systems, and the interactions between them. SC permits a precise description of a hypothetical mechanism to be written using an intuitive graph-based or a calculus-based notation. The same description can then be directly run as a simulation, merging the hypothetical mechanism and the simulation into the same entity. However, even when using well-designed modelling tools to produce good models, the best model is not always the most accurate one. Frequently, computational constraints or lack of data make it infeasible to model an aspect of biology. Simplification may provide one way forward, but with inevitable consequences of decreased accuracy. Instead of attempting to replace an element with a simpler approximation, it is sometimes possible to substitute the element with a different but functionally similar component. In the second part of this paper, this modelling approach is described and its advantages are summarized using an exemplar: the fractal protein model. Finally, the paper ends with a discussion of good biological modelling practice by presenting lessons learned from the use of SC and the fractal protein model.",M1

19304492,"An interoperability test framework for HL7-based systems.Health Level Seven (HL7) is a prominent messaging standard in the eHealth domain, and with HL7 v2, it addresses only the messaging layer. However, HL7 implementations also deal with the other layers of interoperability, namely the business process layer and the communication layer. This need is addressed in HL7 v3 by providing a number of normative transport specification profiles. Furthermore, there are storyboards describing HL7 v3 message choreographies between specific roles in specific events. Having alternative transport protocols and descriptive message choreographies introduces great flexibility in implementing HL7 standards, yet, this brings in the need for test frameworks that can accommodate different protocols and permit the dynamic definition of test scenarios.

RESULTS: We have developed a software tool called R GUI Generator (RGG) which enables the easy generation of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for the programming <e>language</e> R by adding a few Extensible Markup Language (XML) - tags. RGG consists of an XML-based GUI definition language and a Java-based GUI engine. GUIs are generated in runtime from defined GUI tags that are embedded into the R script.

19109877,"SimHap GUI: an intuitive graphical user interface for genetic association analysis.BACKGROUND: Researchers wishing to conduct genetic association analysis involving single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes are often confronted with the lack of user-friendly graphical analysis tools, requiring sophisticated statistical and informatics expertise to perform relatively straightforward tasks. Tools, such as the SimHap package for the R statistics <e>language</e>, provide the necessary statistical operations to conduct sophisticated genetic analysis, but lacks a graphical user interface that allows anyone but a professional statistician to effectively utilise the tool. RESULTS: We have developed SimHap GUI, a cross-platform integrated graphical analysis tool for conducting epidemiological, single SNP and haplotype-based association analysis. SimHap GUI features a novel workflow interface that guides the user through each logical step of the analysis process, making it accessible to both novice and advanced users. This tool provides a seamless interface to the SimHap R package, while providing enhanced functionality such as sophisticated data checking, automated data conversion, and real-time estimations of haplotype simulation progress. CONCLUSION: SimHap GUI provides a novel, easy-to-use, cross-platform solution for conducting a range of genetic and non-genetic association analyses. This provides a free alternative to commercial statistics packages that is specifically designed for genetic association analysis.",M1
19102773,"RPPAML/RIMS: a metadata format and an information management system for reverse phase protein arrays.BACKGROUND: Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA) are convenient assay platforms to investigate the presence of biomarkers in tissue lysates. As with other high-throughput technologies, substantial amounts of analytical data are generated. Over 1,000 samples may be printed on a single nitrocellulose slide. Up to 100 different proteins may be assessed using immunoperoxidase or immunoflorescence techniques in order to determine relative amounts of protein expression in the samples of interest. RESULTS: In this report an RPPA Information Management System (RIMS) is described and made available with open source software. In order to implement the proposed system, we propose a metadata format known as reverse phase protein array markup <e>language</e> (RPPAML). RPPAML would enable researchers to describe, document and disseminate RPPA data. The complexity of the data structure needed to describe the results and the graphic tools necessary to visualize them require a software deployment distributed between a client and a server application. This was achieved without sacrificing interoperability between individual deployments through the use of an open source semantic database, S3DB. This data service backbone is available to multiple client side applications that can also access other server side deployments. The RIMS platform was designed to interoperate with other data analysis and data visualization tools such as Cytoscape. CONCLUSION: The proposed RPPAML data format hopes to standardize RPPA data. Standardization of data would result in diverse client applications being able to operate on the same set of data. Additionally, having data in a standard format would enable data dissemination and data analysis.",M1
19070934,"XML technologies for the Omaha System: a data model, a Java tool and several case studies supporting home healthcare.The eXtensible markup <e>language</e> (XML) is a metalanguage which is useful to represent and exchange data between heterogeneous systems. XML may enable healthcare practitioners to document, monitor, evaluate, and archive medical information and services into distributed computer environments. Therefore, the most recent proposals on electronic health records (EHRs) are usually based on XML documents. Since none of the existing nomenclatures were specifically developed for use in automated clinical information systems, but were adapted to such use, numerous current EHRs are organized as a sequence of events, each represented through codes taken from international classification systems. In nursing, a hierarchically organized problem-solving approach is followed, which hardly couples with the sequential organization of such EHRs. Therefore, the paper presents an XML data model for the Omaha System taxonomy, which is one of the most important international nomenclatures used in the home healthcare nursing context. Such a data model represents the formal definition of EHRs specifically developed for nursing practice. Furthermore, the paper delineates a Java application prototype which is able to manage such documents, shows the possibility to transform such documents into readable web pages, and reports several case studies, one currently managed by the home care service of a Health Center in Central Italy.",M1
19045830,"Virtual Cell modelling and simulation software environment.The Virtual Cell (VCell; http://vcell.org/) is a problem solving environment, built on a central database, for analysis, modelling and simulation of cell biological processes. VCell integrates a growing range of molecular mechanisms, including reaction kinetics, diffusion, flow, membrane transport, lateral membrane diffusion and electrophysiology, and can associate these with geometries derived from experimental microscope images. It has been developed and deployed as a web-based, distributed, client-server system, with more than a thousand world-wide users. VCell provides a separation of layers (core technologies and abstractions) representing biological models, physical mechanisms, geometry, mathematical models and numerical methods. This separation clarifies the impact of modelling decisions, assumptions and approximations. The result is a physically consistent, mathematically rigorous, spatial modelling and simulation framework. Users create biological models and VCell will automatically (i) generate the appropriate mathematical encoding for running a simulation and (ii) generate and compile the appropriate computer code. Both deterministic and stochastic algorithms are supported for describing and running non-spatial simulations; a full partial differential equation solver using the finite volume numerical algorithm is available for reaction-diffusion-advection simulations in complex cell geometries including 3D geometries derived from microscope images. Using the VCell database, models and model components can be reused and updated, as well as privately shared among collaborating groups, or published. Exchange of models with other tools is possible via import/export of SBML, CellML and MatLab formats. Furthermore, curation of models is facilitated by external database binding mechanisms for unique identification of components and by standardised annotations compliant with the MIRIAM standard. VCell is now open source, with its native model encoding <e>language</e> (VCML) being a public specification, which stands as the basis for a new generation of more customised, experiment-centric modelling tools using a new plug-in based platform.",M1

While realizing a complex real-world scenario, IHE profiles are combined by grouping the related IHE actors. Grouping IHE actors implies that the associated business processes (IHE profiles) that the actors are involved must be combined, that is, the choreography of the resulting collaborative business process must be determined by deciding on the execution sequence of transactions coming from different profiles. There are many IHE profiles and each user or vendor may support a different set of IHE profiles that fits to its business need. However, determining the precedence of all the involved transactions manually for each possible combination of the profiles is a very tedious task. In this paper, we describe how to obtain the overall business process automatically when IHE actors are grouped. For this purpose, we represent the IHE profiles through a standard, machine-processable language, namely, Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) ebusiness eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML) Business Process Specification (ebBP) Language. We define the precedence rules among the transactions of the IHE profiles, again, in a machine-processable way. Then, through a graphical tool, we allow users to select the actors to be grouped and automatically produce the overall business process in a machine-processable format.",M1

18986514,"LRRML: a conformational database and an XML description of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs).BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) are present in more than 6000 proteins. They are found in organisms ranging from viruses to eukaryotes and play an important role in protein-ligand interactions. To date, more than one hundred crystal structures of LRR containing proteins have been determined. This knowledge has increased our ability to use the crystal structures as templates to model LRR proteins with unknown structures. Since the individual three-dimensional LRR structures are not directly available from the established databases and since there are only a few detailed annotations for them, a conformational LRR database useful for homology modeling of LRR proteins is desirable. DESCRIPTION: We developed LRRML, a conformational database and an extensible markup <e>language</e> (XML) description of LRRs. The release 0.2 contains 1261 individual LRR structures, which were identified from 112 PDB structures and annotated manually. An XML structure was defined to exchange and store the LRRs. LRRML provides a source for homology modeling and structural analysis of LRR proteins. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the database we modeled the mouse Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) by multiple templates homology modeling and compared the result with the crystal structure. CONCLUSION: LRRML is an information source for investigators involved in both theoretical and applied research on LRR proteins. It is available at http://zeus.krist.geo.uni-muenchen.de/~lrrml.",M1

ISML is fully compatible with CellML 1.0, a model description standard developed by the IUPS Physiome Project, for enhancing knowledge integration and model sharing. This article illustrates the new specifications of ISML 1.0 that largely extend the capability of ISML 0.1. ISML 1.0 can describe various types of mathematical models, including ordinary/partial differential/difference equations representing the dynamics of physiological functions and the geometry of living organisms underlying the functions. ISML 1.0 describes a model using a set of functional elements (modules) each of which can specify mathematical expressions of the functions. Structural and logical relationships between any two modules are specified by edges, which allow modular, hierarchical, and/or network representations of the model. The role of edge-relationships is enriched by key words in order for use in constructing a physiological ontology. The ontology is further improved by the traceability of history of the model's development and by linking between different ISML models stored in the model's database using meta-information. ISML 1.0 is designed to operate with a model database and integrated environments for model development and simulations for knowledge integration and discovery.",M1
18975148,"The NIFSTD and BIRNLex vocabularies: building comprehensive ontologies for neuroscience.A critical component of the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) project is a consistent, flexible terminology for describing and retrieving neuroscience-relevant resources. Although the original NIF specification called for a loosely structured controlled vocabulary for describing neuroscience resources, as the NIF system evolved, the requirement for a formally structured ontology for neuroscience with sufficient granularity to describe and access a diverse collection of information became obvious. This requirement led to the NIF standardized (NIFSTD) ontology, a comprehensive collection of common neuroscience domain terminologies woven into an ontologically consistent, unified representation of the biomedical domains typically used to describe neuroscience data (e.g., anatomy, cell types, techniques), as well as digital resources (tools, databases) being created throughout the neuroscience community. NIFSTD builds upon a structure established by the BIRNLex, a lexicon of concepts covering clinical neuroimaging research developed by the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN) project. Each distinct domain module is represented using the Web Ontology <e>Language</e> (OWL). As much as has been practical, NIFSTD reuses existing community ontologies that cover the required biomedical domains, building the more specific concepts required to annotate NIF resources. By following this principle, an extensive vocabulary was assembled in a relatively short period of time for NIF information annotation, organization, and retrieval, in a form that promotes easy extension and modification. We report here on the structure of the NIFSTD, and its predecessor BIRNLex, the principles followed in its construction and provide examples of its use within NIF.",M1

Without modifying the system, the authors tested the ability of MedLEE to remove protected health information (PHI) by comparing 100 outpatient clinical notes with the corresponding XML-tagged output. Of 809 instances of PHI, 26 (3.2%) were detected in output as a result of processing and identification errors. However, PHI in the output was highly transformed, much appearing as normalized terms for medical concepts, potentially making re-identification more difficult. The MedLEE processor may be a good enhancement to other de-identification systems, both removing PHI and providing coded data from clinical text.",M1
18950994,"Versioning computer-interpretable guidelines: semi-automatic modeling of 'Living Guidelines' using an information extraction method.OBJECTIVE: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are means to provide evidence-based medical knowledge. In order to make up-to-date  best  scientific evidence available these documents need to be updated on an ongoing basis. An effective method to accomplish this aim is offered by the so-called  living guidelines : Living guidelines are documents presenting up-to-date and state-of-the-art knowledge to practitioners. To have guidelines implemented by computer-support they have to be formalized in a computer-interpretable form in a first step. Due to the complexity of such formats the formalization process is burdensome and time-consuming. Automating parts of the modeling process and, consequently, modeling updates of these guideline documents are demanded. METHODS AND MATERIAL: The LASSIE methodology supports this task by formalizing guidelines in several steps from the textual form to the guideline representation <e>language</e> Asbru using a document-centric approach. LASSIE uses information extraction techniques to semi-automatically accomplish these steps. We apply LASSIE to support the implementation of living guidelines. RESULTS: Based on a living guideline published by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) we show that adaptations of previously formalized guidelines can be accomplished easily and fast. Thereby, the different versions of guideline documents are compared and updates are identified. Due to the traceable formalization method of linking text parts and their corresponding formal models, we are able to inherit unchanged models from previously formalized versions. Thus, we only need to formalize updated text parts using the semi-automatic formalization method LASSIE. CONCLUSION: We propose a simple, time-saving, but effective method called LASSIE to formalize new guideline versions of previously formalized CPGs. Furthermore, models that have been added or modified by knowledge engineers in previous versions can also be transferred easily. This will result in a faster implementation of new guideline versions also known as living guidelines to provide up-to-date knowledge necessary for accomplishing the daily work of health care professionals.",M1

18812313,"The ALFA (Activity Log Files Aggregation) toolkit: a method for precise observation of the consultation.BACKGROUND: There is a lack of tools to evaluate and compare Electronic patient record (EPR) systems to inform a rational choice or development agenda. OBJECTIVE: To develop a tool kit to measure the impact of different EPR system features on the consultation. METHODS: We first developed a specification to overcome the limitations of existing methods. We divided this into work packages: (1) developing a method to display multichannel video of the consultation; (2) code and measure activities, including computer use and verbal interactions; (3) automate the capture of nonverbal interactions; (4) aggregate multiple observations into a single navigable output; and (5) produce an output interpretable by software developers. We piloted this method by filming live consultations (n = 22) by 4 general practitioners (GPs) using different EPR systems. We compared the time taken and variations during coded data entry, prescribing, and blood pressure (BP) recording. We used nonparametric tests to make statistical comparisons. We contrasted methods of BP recording using Unified Modeling <e>Language</e> (UML) sequence diagrams. RESULTS: We found that 4 channels of video were optimal. We identified an existing application for manual coding of video output. We developed in-house tools for capturing use of keyboard and mouse and to time stamp speech. The transcript is then typed within this time stamp. Although we managed to capture body language using pattern recognition software, we were unable to use this data quantitatively. We loaded these observational outputs into our aggregation tool, which allows simultaneous navigation and viewing of multiple files. This also creates a single exportable file in XML format, which we used to develop UML sequence diagrams. In our pilot, the GP using the EMIS LV (Egton Medical Information Systems Limited, Leeds, UK) system took the longest time to code data (mean 11.5 s, 95% CI 8.7-14.2). Nonparametric comparison of EMIS LV with the other systems showed a significant difference, with EMIS PCS (Egton Medical Information Systems Limited, Leeds, UK) (P = .007), iSoft Synergy (iSOFT, Banbury, UK) (P = .014), and INPS Vision (INPS, London, UK) (P = .006) facilitating faster coding. In contrast, prescribing was fastest with EMIS LV (mean 23.7 s, 95% CI 20.5-26.8), but nonparametric comparison showed no statistically significant difference. UML sequence diagrams showed that the simplest BP recording interface was not the easiest to use, as users spent longer navigating or looking up previous blood pressures separately. Complex interfaces with free-text boxes left clinicians unsure of what to add. CONCLUSIONS: The ALFA method allows the precise observation of the clinical consultation. It enables rigorous comparison of core elements of EPR systems. Pilot data suggests its capacity to demonstrate differences between systems. Its outputs could provide the evidence base for making more objective choices between systems.",M1
18806335,"Improving the execution of clinical guidelines and temporal data abstraction high-frequency domains.The execution of clinical guidelines and protocols (CGPs) is a challenging task in high-frequency domains such as Intensive Care Units.

18777915,"High performance computing for deformable image registration: towards a new paradigm in adaptive radiotherapy.The advent of readily available temporal imaging or time series volumetric (4D) imaging has become an indispensable component of treatment planning and adaptive radiotherapy (ART) at many radiotherapy centers. Deformable image registration (DIR) is also used in other areas of medical imaging, including motion corrected image reconstruction. Due to long computation time, clinical applications of DIR in radiation therapy and elsewhere have been limited and consequently relegated to offline analysis. With the recent advances in hardware and software, graphics processing unit (GPU) based computing is an emerging technology for general purpose computation, including DIR, and is suitable for highly parallelized computing. However, traditional general purpose computation on the GPU is limited because the constraints of the available programming platforms. As well, compared to CPU programming, the GPU currently has reduced dedicated processor memory, which can limit the useful working data set for parallelized processing. We present an implementation of the demons algorithm using the NVIDIA 8800 GTX GPU and the new CUDA programming <e>language</e>. The GPU performance will be compared with single threading and multithreading CPU implementations on an Intel dual core 2.4 GHz CPU using the C programming language. CUDA provides a C-like language programming interface, and allows for direct access to the highly parallel compute units in the GPU. Comparisons for volumetric clinical lung images acquired using 4DCT were carried out. Computation time for 100 iterations in the range of 1.8-13.5 s was observed for the GPU with image size ranging from 2.0 x 10(6) to 14.2 x 10(6) pixels. The GPU registration was 55-61 times faster than the CPU for the single threading implementation, and 34-39 times faster for the multithreading implementation. For CPU based computing, the computational time generally has a linear dependence on image size for medical imaging data. Computational efficiency is characterized in terms of time per megapixels per iteration (TPMI) with units of seconds per megapixels per iteration (or spmi). For the demons algorithm, our CPU implementation yielded largely invariant values of TPMI. The mean TPMIs were 0.527 spmi and 0.335 spmi for the single threading and multithreading cases, respectively, with &lt;2% variation over the considered image data range. For GPU computing, we achieved TPMI =0.00916 spmi with 3.7% variation, indicating optimized memory handling under CUDA.

This method could help physicians to make treatment decisions if implemented in a system where glucose data are transferred to a remote server. The method, however, cannot replace HbA1c measurements; past HbA1c values are needed to gauge the method. METHODS: The mathematical model of HbA1c formation was developed based on biochemical principles. Unlike an existing HbA1c formula, the new model respects the decreasing contribution of older glucose levels to current HbA1c values. About 12 standard SQL statements embedded in a php program were used to perform Fourier transform. Regression analysis was used to gauge results with previous HbA1c values. The method can be readily implemented in any SQL database. RESULTS: The predicted HbA1c values thus obtained were in accordance with measured values. They also matched the results of the HbA1c formula in the elevated range. By contrast, the formula was too  optimistic  in the range of better glycemic control.

RESULTS: Developments in the Taverna workflow system have enabled pipelines to be constructed and enacted for generic and ad hoc analyses of quantitative data. Here, we present an example of such a workflow involving the statistical identification of differentially-expressed genes from microarray data followed by the annotation of their relationships to cellular processes. This workflow makes use of customised maxdBrowse web services, a system that allows Taverna to query and retrieve gene expression data from the maxdLoad2 microarray database. These data are then analysed by R to identify differentially-expressed genes using the Taverna RShell processor which has been developed for invoking this tool when it has been deployed as a service using the RServe library. In addition, the workflow uses Beanshell scripts to reconcile mismatches of data between services as well as to implement a form of user interaction for selecting subsets of microarray data for analysis as part of the workflow execution. A new plugin system in the Taverna software architecture is demonstrated by the use of renderers for displaying PDF files and CSV formatted data within the Taverna workbench. CONCLUSION: Taverna can be used by data analysis experts as a generic tool for composing ad hoc analyses of quantitative data by combining the use of scripts written in the R programming language with tools exposed as services in workflows. When these workflows are shared with colleagues and the wider scientific community, they provide an approach for other scientists wanting to use tools such as R without having to learn the corresponding programming language to analyse their own data.",M1
18684591,"The emergent neural modeling system.Emergent (http://grey.colorado.edu/emergent) is a powerful tool for the simulation of biologically plausible, complex neural systems that was released in August 2007. Inheriting decades of research and experience in network algorithms and modeling principles from its predecessors, PDP++ and PDP, Emergent has been redesigned as an efficient workspace for academic research and an engaging, easy-to-navigate environment for students. The system provides a modern and intuitive interface for programming and visualization centered around hierarchical, tree-based navigation and drag-and-drop reorganization. Emergent contains familiar, high-level simulation constructs such as Layers and Projections, a wide variety of algorithms, general-purpose data handling and analysis facilities and an integrated virtual environment for developing closed-loop cognitive agents. For students, the traditional role of a textbook has been enhanced by wikis embedded in every project that serve to explain, document, and help newcomers engage the interface and step through models using familiar hyperlinks. For advanced users, the software is easily extensible in all respects via runtime plugins, has a powerful shell with an integrated debugger, and a scripting <e>language</e> that is fully symmetric with the interface. Emergent strikes a balance between detailed, computationally expensive spiking neuron models and abstract, Bayesian or symbolic systems. This middle level of detail allows for the rapid development and successful execution of complex cognitive models while maintaining biological plausibility.",M1
18672455,"SARANA: <e>language</e>, compiler and run-time system support for spatially aware and resource-aware mobile computing.Increasingly, spatial awareness plays a central role in many distributed and mobile computing applications. Spatially aware applications rely on information about the geographical position of compute devices and their supported services in order to support novel functionality. While many spatial application drivers already exist in mobile and distributed computing, very little systems research has explored how best to program these applications, to express their spatial and temporal constraints, and to allow efficient implementations on highly dynamic real-world platforms. This paper proposes the SARANA system architecture, which includes language and run-time system support for spatially aware and resource-aware applications. SARANA allows users to express spatial regions of interest, as well as trade-offs between quality of result (QoR), latency and cost. The goal is to produce applications that use resources efficiently and that can be run on diverse resource-constrained platforms ranging from laptops to personal digital assistants and to smart phones. SARANA's run-time system manages QoR and cost trade-offs dynamically by tracking resource availability and locations, brokering usage/pricing agreements and migrating programs to nodes accordingly. A resource cost model permeates the SARANA system layers, permitting users to express their resource needs and QoR expectations in units that make sense to them. Although we are still early in the system development, initial versions have been demonstrated on a nine-node system prototype.",M1

Despite such efforts, there are no researches produced so far to directly analyse, with statistical methods, biomedical data represented as eXtensible Markup <e>Language</e> (XML) documents. Thus, the paper proposes an architecture which offers a twofold approach to the statistical analysis of XML data, i.e. via a web service and by extending the query languages used in XML databases. To show how the architecture can be used, a sample system is also reported. Finally, the paper ends by reporting the advantages and drawbacks of the proposed approach in comparison with classic statistical packages.",M1
18617367,"Deducing logical relationships between spatially registered cortical parcellations under conditions of uncertainty.We propose a new technique, called Spatial Objective Relational Transformation (SORT), as an automated approach for derivation of logical relationships between cortical areas in different brain maps registered in the same Euclidean space. Recently, there have been large amounts of voxel-based three-dimensional structural and functional imaging data that provide us with coordinate-based information about the location of differently defined areas in the brain, whereas coordinate-independent, parcellation-based mapping is still commonly used in the majority of animal tracing and mapping studies. Because of the impact of voxel-based imaging methods and the need to attribute their features to coordinate-independent brain entities, this mapping becomes increasingly important. Our motivation here is not to make vague statements where more precise spatial statements would be better, but to find criteria for the identity (or other logical relationships) between areas that were delineated by different methods, in different individuals, or mapped to three-dimensional space using different deformation algorithms. The relevance of this problem becomes immediately obvious as one superimposes and compares different datasets in multimodal databases (e.g. CARET, http://brainmap.wustl.edu/caret), where voxel-based data are registered to surface nodes exploited by the procedure presented here. We describe the SORT algorithm and its implementation in the Java 2 programming <e>language</e> (http://java.sun.com/, which we make available for download. We give an example of practical use of our approach, and validate the SORT approach against a database of the coordinate-independent statements and inferences that have been deduced using alternative techniques.",M1

18607780,"Describing different brain computer interface systems through a unique model: a UML implementation.All the protocols currently implemented in brain computer interface (BCI) experiments are characterized by different structural and temporal entities. Moreover, due to the lack of a unique descriptive model for BCI systems, there is not a standard way to define the structure and the timing of a BCI experimental session among different research groups and there is also great discordance on the meaning of the most common terms dealing with BCI, such as trial, run and session. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified modeling <e>language</e> (UML) implementation of BCI systems through a unique dynamic model which is able to describe the main protocols defined in the literature (P300, mu-rhythms, SCP, SSVEP, fMRI) and demonstrates to be reasonable and adjustable according to different requirements. This model includes a set of definitions of the typical entities encountered in a BCI, diagrams which explain the structural correlations among them and a detailed description of the timing of a trial. This last represents an innovation with respect to the models already proposed in the literature. The UML documentation and the possibility of adapting this model to the different BCI systems built to date, make it a basis for the implementation of new systems and a mean for the unification and dissemination of resources. The model with all the diagrams and definitions reported in the paper are the core of the body language framework, a free set of routines and tools for the implementation, optimization and delivery of cross-platform BCI systems.",M1
18599379,"Schema driven assignment and implementation of life science identifiers (LSIDs).Life science identifier (LSID) is a global unique identifier standard intended to help rationalize the unique archival requirements of biological data. We describe LSID implementation architecture such that data managed by a relational database management system may be integrated with the LSID protocol as an add-on layer. The approach requires a database administrator (DBA) to specify an export schema detailing the content and structure of the archived data, and a mapping of the existing database to that schema. This specification can be expressed using SQL view syntax. In effect, we define a SQL-like <e>language</e> for implementing LSIDs. We describe the mapping of the view definition to an implementation as a set of databases triggers and a fixed runtime library. Thus a compiler for a domain-specific language could be written that would reduce the implementation of LSIDs to the task of writing SQL view-like definitions.",M1
18590985,"A model-driven approach for representing clinical archetypes for Semantic Web environments.The life-long clinical information of any person supported by electronic means configures his Electronic Health Record (EHR). This information is usually distributed among several independent and heterogeneous systems that may be syntactically or semantically incompatible. There are currently different standards for representing and exchanging EHR information among different systems. In advanced EHR approaches, clinical information is represented by means of archetypes. Most of these approaches use the Archetype Definition <e>Language</e> (ADL) to specify archetypes. However, ADL has some drawbacks when attempting to perform semantic activities in Semantic Web environments. In this work, Semantic Web technologies are used to specify clinical archetypes for advanced EHR architectures. The advantages of using the Ontology Web Language (OWL) instead of ADL are described and discussed in this work. Moreover, a solution combining Semantic Web and Model-driven Engineering technologies is proposed to transform ADL into OWL for the CEN EN13606 EHR architecture.",M1
18584245,"A web-based solution for viewing large-sized microscopic images.This paper demonstrates a pure web-based solution enabling the presentation of scanned pathologic microscopic images on the web. For each slide, an entire specimen is scanned, and a high-resolution digital image (in the order of giga-pixels) is reconstructed. These huge images are then tiled into many 256 x 256-pixel blocks with different resolutions, and information about the blocks of each scanned slide is included in an extensible markup <e>language</e> metafile. Based on the data, a virtual microscopy system is created for viewing the scanned pathologic slides on web. The functionalities (changing viewing resolution, location adjustment, and multimedia annotation presentation) of our virtual slide viewing system are accomplished using pure hypertext markup language (HTML) and JavaScript.

18579471,"CellML and associated tools and techniques.We have, in the last few years, witnessed the development and availability of an ever increasing number of computer models that describe complex biological structures and processes. The multi-scale and multi-physics nature of these models makes their development particularly challenging, not only from a biological or biophysical viewpoint but also from a mathematical and computational perspective. In addition, the issue of sharing and reusing such models has proved to be particularly problematic, with the published models often lacking information that is required to accurately reproduce the published results. The International Union of Physiological Sciences Physiome Project was launched in 1997 with the aim of tackling the aforementioned issues by providing a framework for the modelling of the human body. As part of this initiative, the specifications of the CellML mark-up <e>language</e> were released in 2001. Now, more than 7 years later, the time has come to assess the situation, in particular with regard to the tools and techniques that are now available to the modelling community. Thus, after introducing CellML, we review and discuss existing editors, validators, online repository, code generators and simulation environments, as well as the CellML Application Program Interface. We also address possible future directions including the need for additional mark-up languages.",M1
18570683,"Systematic reconstruction of TRANSPATH data into cell system markup <e>language</e>.BACKGROUND: Many biological repositories store information based on experimental study of the biological processes within a cell, such as protein-protein interactions, metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways, or regulations of transcription factors and miRNA. Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly use such information when generating simulation-based models. Thus, modeling rules for encoding biological knowledge into system-dynamics-oriented standardized formats would be very useful for fully understanding cellular dynamics at the system level. RESULTS: We selected the TRANSPATH database, a manually curated high-quality pathway database, which provides a plentiful source of cellular events in humans, mice, and rats, collected from over 31,500 publications. In this work, we have developed 16 modeling rules based on hybrid functional Petri net with extension (HFPNe), which is suitable for graphical representing and simulating biological processes. In the modeling rules, each Petri net element is incorporated with Cell System Ontology to enable semantic interoperability of models. As a formal ontology for biological pathway modeling with dynamics, CSO also defines biological terminology and corresponding icons. By combining HFPNe with the CSO features, it is possible to make TRANSPATH data to simulation-based and semantically valid models. The results are encoded into a biological pathway format, Cell System Markup Language (CSML), which eases the exchange and integration of biological data and models. CONCLUSION: By using the 16 modeling rules, 97% of the reactions in TRANSPATH are converted into simulation-based models represented in CSML. This reconstruction demonstrates that it is possible to use our rules to generate quantitative models from static pathway descriptions.",M1

This fourth workshop of the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) was a mix of short presentations, strategy discussions, and technical sessions. Speakers provided progress reports on the development of the  Minimum Information about a Genome Sequence  (MIGS) specification and the closely integrated  Minimum Information about a Metagenome Sequence  (MIMS) specification. The key outcome of the workshop was consensus on the next version of the MIGS/MIMS specification (v1.2). This drove further definition and restructuring of the MIGS/MIMS XML schema (syntax). With respect to semantics, a term vetting group was established to ensure that terms are properly defined and submitted to the appropriate ontology projects. Perhaps the single most important outcome of the workshop was a proposal to move beyond the concept of  minimum  to create a far richer XML schema that would define a  Genomic Contextual Data Markup <e>Language</e>  (GCDML) suitable for wider semantic integration across databases. GCDML will contain not only curated information (e.g., compliant with MIGS/MIMS), but also be extended to include a variety of data processing and calculations.

Admittedly, the PROTO-PLASM platform is still in its infancy. Its computational framework--language, model library, integrated development environment and parallel engine--intends to provide patient-specific computational modelling and simulation of organs and biosystem, exploiting novel functionalities resulting from the symbolic combination of parametrized models of parts at various scales. PROTO-PLASM may define the model equations, but it is currently focused on the symbolic description of model geometry and on the parallel support of simulations. Conversely, CellML and SBML could be viewed as defining the behavioural functions (the model equations) to be used within a PROTO-PLASM program. Here we exemplify the basic functionalities of PROTO-PLASM, by constructing a schematic heart model.

18547428,"An update on Uniform Resource Locator (URL) decay in MEDLINE abstracts and measures for its mitigation.BACKGROUND: For years, Uniform Resource Locator (URL) decay or  link rot  has been a growing concern in the field of biomedical sciences. This paper addresses this issue by examining the status of the URLs published in MEDLINE abstracts, establishing current availability and estimating URL decay in these records from 1994 to 2006. We also reviewed the information provided by the URL to determine if the context that the author cited in writing the paper is the same information presently available in the URL. Lastly, with all the documented recommended methods to preserve URL links, we determined which among them have gained acceptance among authors and publishers. METHODS: MEDLINE records from 1994 to 2006 from the National Library of Medicine in Extensible Mark-up <e>Language</e> (XML) format were processed yielding 10,208 URL addresses. These were accessed once daily at random times for 30 days. Titles and abstracts were also searched for the presence of archival tools such as WebCite, Persistent URL (PURL) and Digital Object Identifier (DOI). RESULTS: Results showed that the average URL length ranged from 13 to 425 characters with a mean length of 35 characters [Standard Deviation (SD) = 13.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 13.25 to 13.77]. The most common top-level domains were  .org  and  .edu , each with 34%. About 81% of the URL pool was available 90% to 100% of the time, but only 78% of these contained the actual information mentioned in the MEDLINE record.  Dead  URLs constituted 16% of the total. Finally, a survey of archival tool usage showed that since its introduction in 1998, only 519 of all abstracts reviewed had incorporated DOI addresses in their MEDLINE abstracts. CONCLUSION: URL persistence parallels previous studies which showed approximately 81% general availability during the 1-month study period. As peer-reviewed literature remains to be the main source of information in biomedicine, we need to ensure the accuracy and preservation of these links.",M1
18541497,"Implementation of pipelined FastICA on FPGA for real-time blind source separation.Fast independent component analysis (FastICA) algorithm separates the independent sources from their mixtures by measuring non-Gaussian. FastICA is a common offline method to identify artifact and interference from their mixtures such as electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). Therefore, it is valuable to implement FastICA for real-time signal processing.

18518945,"Design of a graphical and interactive interface for facilitating access to drug contraindications, cautions for use, interactions and adverse effects.BACKGROUND: Drug iatrogeny is important but could be decreased if contraindications, cautions for use, drug interactions and adverse effects of drugs described in drug monographs were taken into account. However, the physician's time is limited during consultations, and this information is often not consulted. We describe here the design of  Mister VCM , a graphical interface based on the VCM graphical <e>language</e>, facilitating access to drug monographs. We also provide an assessment of the usability of this interface. METHODS: The  Mister VCM  interface was designed by dividing the screen into two parts: a graphical interactive one including VCM icons and synthetizing drug properties, a textual one presenting on demand drug monograph excerpts. The interface was evaluated over 11 volunteer general practitioners, trained in the use of  Mister VCM . They were asked to answer clinical questions related to fictitious randomly generated drug monographs, using a textual interface or  Mister VCM . When answering the questions, correctness of the responses and response time were recorded. RESULTS:  Mister VCM  is an interactive interface that displays VCM icons organized around an anatomical diagram of the human body with additional mental, etiological and physiological areas. Textual excerpts of the drug monograph can be displayed by clicking on the VCM icons. The interface can explicitly represent information implicit in the drug monograph, such as the absence of a given contraindication. Physicians made fewer errors with  Mister VCM  than with text (factor of 1.7; p = 0.034) and responded to questions 2.2 times faster (p &lt; 0.001). The time gain with  Mister VCM  was greater for long monographs and questions with implicit replies. CONCLUSION:  Mister VCM  seems to be a promising interface for accessing drug monographs. Similar interfaces could be developed for other medical domains, such as electronic patient records.",M1

Web feeds (a.k.a RSS feeds), which were used mostly on weblogs at first, are now also widely used in academic, scientific and institutional websites such as PubMed. As very few French language feeds were listed or catalogued in the Health field by the year of 2007, it was decided to implement them in the quality-controlled health gateway CISMeF ([French] acronym for Catalogue and Index of French Language Health Resources on the Internet). Furthermore, making full use of the nature of Web syndication, a Web feed aggregator was put online in to provide a dynamic news gateway called  CISMeF actualités  (http://www.chu-rouen.fr/actualites/). This article describes the process to retrieve and implement the Web feeds in the catalogue and how its terminology was adjusted to describe this new content. It also describes how the aggregator was put online and the features of this news gateway. CISMeF actualités was built accordingly to the editorial policy of CISMeF. Only a part of the Web feeds of the catalogue were included to display the most authoritative sources. Web feeds were also grouped by medical specialties and by countries using the prior indexing of websites with MeSH terms and the so-called metaterms. CISMeF actualités now displays 131 Web feeds across 40 different medical specialities, coming from 5 different countries.

18451431,"Toward verified biological models.The last several decades have witnessed a vast accumulation of biological data and data analysis. Many of these data sets represent only a small fraction of the system's behavior, making the visualization of full system behavior difficult. A more complete understanding of a biological system is gained when different types of data (and/or conclusions drawn from the data) are integrated into a larger-scale representation or model of the system. Ideally, this type of model is consistent with all available data about the system, and it is then used to generate additional hypotheses to be tested. Computer-based methods intended to formulate models that integrate various events and to test the consistency of these models with respect to the laboratory-based observations on which they are based are potentially very useful. In addition, in contrast to informal models, the consistency of such formal computer-based models with laboratory data can be tested rigorously by methods of formal verification. We combined two formal modeling approaches in computer science that were originally developed for non-biological system design. One is the inter-object approach using the <e>language</e> of live sequence charts (LSCs) with the Play-Engine tool, and the other is the intra-object approach using the language of statecharts and Rhapsody as the tool. Integration is carried out using InterPlay, a simulation engine coordinator. Using these tools, we constructed a combined model comprising three modules. One module represents the early lineage of the somatic gonad of C. elegans in LSCs, while a second more detailed module in statecharts represents an interaction between two cells within this lineage that determine their developmental outcome. Using the advantages of the tools, we created a third module representing a set of key experimental data using LSCs. We tested the combined statechart-LSC model by showing that the simulations were consistent with the set of experimental LSCs. This small-scale modular example demonstrates the potential for using similar approaches for verification by exhaustive testing of models by LSCs. It also shows the advantages of these approaches for modeling biology.",M1

Both of these features present significant challenges for storage, retrieval and analysis. For optimal data modeling and flexibility, we needed a platform that supported both multidimensional indices and hierarchical relationships between related types of data and that could be integrated within our data warehouse, as described in the accompanying paper directly preceding this one. For these reasons, we have chosen On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP), a multi-dimensional analysis optimized database, as an analytical platform for these data.

The LTER is one of the top National Science Foundation (NSF) programs in biology since 1980, representing diverse ecosystems and creating long-term, interdisciplinary research, synthesis of information, and theory. The adoption of EML as the LTER network standard has been key to build network synthesis architectures based on high-quality standardized metadata. EML is the NSF-recognized metadata standard for LTER, and EML is a criteria used to review the LTER program progress. At the workshop, a potential crosswalk between the GCDML and EML was explored. Also, collaboration between the LTER and GSC developers was proposed to join efforts toward a common metadata cataloging designer's tool. The community adoption success of a metadata standard depends, among other factors, on the tools and trainings developed to use the standard. LTER's experience in embracing EML may help GSC to achieve similar success. A possible collaboration between LTER and GSC to provide training opportunities for GCDML and the associated tools is being explored. Finally, LTER is investigating EML enhancements to better accommodate genomics data, possibly integrating the GCDML schema into EML.

The authors advocate the consideration of 'accounting cycles' or 'chains' to define 'functional' components and the separate consideration of 'messenger' components for mobile or diffusive molecular species. From a conceptual modularisation the authors illustrate, with an example drawn from signal transduction, a component-based formulation in the model exchange format cellular modelling markup <e>language</e> (CellML) 1.1 - demonstrating loose coupling between functionally-focused reusable components. Finally, the authors discuss the dilemmas associated with modelling protein-to-protein interactions, and the vision for using future CellML enhancements to resolve potential duplications when combining independently developed models.",M1

XML is composed of text and tags that explicitly describe the structure and semantics of the content of the document. In this chapter, we describe some of the common uses of XML in neuroscience, with case studies in representing neuroscience data and defining model descriptions based on examples from NeuroML. The specific methods that we discuss include (1) reading and writing XML from applications, (2) exporting XML from databases, (3) using XML standards to represent neuronal morphology data, (4) using XML to represent experimental metadata, and (5) creating new XML specifications for models.",M1
18348952,"XML-based data model and architecture for a knowledge-based grid-enabled problem-solving environment for high-throughput biological imaging.High-throughput biological imaging uses automated imaging devices to collect a large number of microscopic images for analysis of biological systems and validation of scientific hypotheses. Efficient manipulation of these datasets for knowledge discovery requires high-performance computational resources, efficient storage, and automated tools for extracting and sharing such knowledge among different research sites. Newly emerging grid technologies provide powerful means for exploiting the full potential of these imaging techniques. Efficient utilization of grid resources requires the development of knowledge-based tools and services that combine domain knowledge with analysis algorithms. In this paper, we first investigate how grid infrastructure can facilitate high-throughput biological imaging research, and present an architecture for providing knowledge-based grid services for this field. We identify two levels of knowledge-based services. The first level provides tools for extracting spatiotemporal knowledge from image sets and the second level provides high-level knowledge management and reasoning services. We then present cellular imaging markup <e>language</e>, an extensible markup language-based language for modeling of biological images and representation of spatiotemporal knowledge. This scheme can be used for spatiotemporal event composition, matching, and automated knowledge extraction and representation for large biological imaging datasets. We demonstrate the expressive power of this formalism by means of different examples and extensive experimental results.",M1

In order to make CDA compatible with the many different local standards existing in different countries, we designed a prototype model using HL7 CDA R2 with medical markup <e>language</e> (MML), a Japanese medical data exchange standard. Furthermore, a referral letter system based on this model was developed. Archetypes were used to express medical concepts in a formal manner and to make 2 different standards work collaboratively.

We also outline the challenges encountered in our project and the opportunities to widen the scope of this approach to other clinical documents.",M1
18321775,"Modeling the Arden Syntax for medical decisions in XML.PURPOSE: A new model expressing Arden Syntax with the eXtensible Markup <e>Language</e> (XML) was developed to increase its portability. METHODS: Every example was manually parsed and reviewed until the schema and the style sheet were considered to be optimized. When the first schema was finished, several MLMs in Arden Syntax Markup Language (ArdenML) were validated against the schema. They were then transformed to HTML formats with the style sheet, during which they were compared to the original text version of their own MLM. When faults were found in the transformed MLM, the schema and/or style sheet was fixed. This cycle continued until all the examples were encoded into XML documents. The original MLMs were encoded in XML according to the proposed XML schema and reverse-parsed MLMs in ArdenML were checked using a public domain Arden Syntax checker. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy seven examples of MLMs were successfully transformed into XML documents using the model, and the reverse-parse yielded the original text version of MLMs. Two hundred sixty five of the 277 MLMs showed the same error patterns before and after transformation, and all 11 errors related to statement structure were resolved in XML version. The model uses two syntax checking mechanisms, first an XML validation process, and second, a syntax check using an XSL style sheet. CONCLUSION: Now that we have a schema for ArdenML, we can also begin the development of style sheets for transformation ArdenML into other languages.",M1
18298814,"CWRML: representing crop wild relative conservation and use data in XML.BACKGROUND: Crop wild relatives are wild species that are closely related to crops. They are valuable as potential gene donors for crop improvement and may help to ensure food security for the future. However, they are becoming increasingly threatened in the wild and are inadequately conserved, both in situ and ex situ. Information about the conservation status and utilisation potential of crop wild relatives is diverse and dispersed, and no single agreed standard exists for representing such information; yet, this information is vital to ensure these species are effectively conserved and utilised. The European Community-funded project, European Crop Wild Relative Diversity Assessment and Conservation Forum, determined the minimum information requirements for the conservation and utilisation of crop wild relatives and created the Crop Wild Relative Information System, incorporating an eXtensible Markup <e>Language</e> (XML) schema to aid data sharing and exchange. RESULTS: Crop Wild Relative Markup Language (CWRML) was developed to represent the data necessary for crop wild relative conservation and ensure that they can be effectively utilised for crop improvement. The schema partitions data into taxon-, site-, and population-specific elements, to allow for integration with other more general conservation biology schemata which may emerge as accepted standards in the future. These elements are composed of sub-elements, which are structured in order to facilitate the use of the schema in a variety of crop wild relative conservation and use contexts. Pre-existing standards for data representation in conservation biology were reviewed and incorporated into the schema as restrictions on element data contents, where appropriate. CONCLUSION: CWRML provides a flexible data communication format for representing in situ and ex situ conservation status of individual taxa as well as their utilisation potential. The development of the schema highlights a number of instances where additional standards-development may be valuable, particularly with regard to the representation of population-specific data and utilisation potential. As crop wild relatives are intrinsically no different to other wild plant species there is potential for the inclusion of CWRML data elements in the emerging standards for representation of biodiversity data.",M1
18279946,"Increases in <e>language</e> lateralization in normal children as observed using magnetoencephalography.Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating hemispheric dominance for language have shown that hemispheric specialization increases with age. We employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate these effects as a function of normal development. In sum, 22 healthy children aged 7-16 years were investigated using two language tasks: a verb-generation (VG) task and a vowel-identification (VI) task. Significant hemispheric differences were found for both tasks in cerebral language areas using oscillatory MEG spectral analyses, confirming the MEG's ability to detect hemispheric specialization for language in children. Additionally, a significant increase of this lateralization as a function of age was observed for both tasks. As performance in the VI task showed no correlation with age, this increase seems to be unrelated to performance. These results confirm an increase in hemispheric specialization as a function of normal brain maturation.",M1

We compared the memory usage and speed of execution for three standard bioinformatics methods, implemented in programs using one of six different programming languages. Programs for the Sellers algorithm, the Neighbor-Joining tree construction algorithm and an algorithm for parsing BLAST file outputs were implemented in C, C++, C#, Java, Perl and Python. RESULTS: Implementations in C and C++ were fastest and used the least memory. Programs in these languages generally contained more lines of code. Java and C# appeared to be a compromise between the flexibility of Perl and Python and the fast performance of C and C++. The relative performance of the tested languages did not change from Windows to Linux and no clear evidence of a faster operating system was found. Source code and additional information are available from http://www.bioinformatics.org/benchmark/. CONCLUSION: This benchmark provides a comparison of six commonly used programming languages under two different operating systems. The overall comparison shows that a developer should choose an appropriate language carefully, taking into account the performance expected and the library availability for each language.",M1

18214614,"POSTGRESQL-IE: an image-handling extension for PostgreSQL.The last decade witnessed a growing interest in research on content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and related areas. Several systems for managing and retrieving images have been proposed, each one tailored to a specific application. Functionalities commonly available in CBIR systems include: storage and management of complex data, development of feature extractors to support similarity queries, development of index structures to speed up image retrieval, and design and implementation of an intuitive graphical user interface tailored to each application. To facilitate the development of new CBIR systems, we propose an image-handling extension to the relational database management system (RDBMS) PostgreSQL. This extension, called PostgreSQL-IE, is independent of the application and provides the advantage of being open source and portable. The proposed system extends the functionalities of the structured query <e>language</e> SQL with new functions that are able to create new feature extraction procedures, new feature vectors as combinations of previously defined features, and new access methods, as well as to compose similarity queries. PostgreSQL-IE makes available a new image data type, which permits the association of various images with a given unique image attribute. This resource makes it possible to combine visual features of different images in the same feature vector. To validate the concepts and resources available in the proposed extended RDBMS, we propose a CBIR system applied to the analysis of mammograms using PostgreSQL-IE.",M1
20583729,"Retroflexion of voiced stops: data from Dhao, Thulung, Afar and German.The present article illustrates that the specific articulatory requirements for voiced alveolar or dental stops can cause tongue tip retraction and tongue mid lowering and thus retroflexion of voiced front coronals. This retroflexion is shown to have occurred diachronically in the three typologically unrelated <e>languages</e> Dhao (Malayo-Polynesian), Thulung (Sino-Tibetan), and Afar (East Cushitic). In addition to the diachronic cases, we provide synchronic data for retroflexion from an articulatory study with four speakers of German, a language usually described as having alveolar stops. With these combined data we supply evidence that voiced retroflex stops (as the only retroflex segments in a language) could have emerged from dental or alveolar voiced stops because the voiced front coronal plosive /d/ is generally articulated in a way that favors retroflexion, that is, with a smaller and more retracted place of articulation and a lower tongue and jaw position than /t/. The present proposal thereby supplements the observation made by Haudricourt (1950), Greenberg (1970), Bhat (1973), and Ohala (1983) that retroflex voiced stops can emerge from voiced coronal implosives for articulatory and aerodynamic reasons.",M2
20528591,"Ethnic differences in methacholine responsiveness and word descriptors in African Americans, Hispanic-Mexican Americans, Asian-Pacific Islanders, and Whites with mild asthma.OBJECTIVE: There is little asthma research that compares ethnic differences in airway responsiveness and word descriptors among African Americans, Hispanic-Mexican Americans, Asian-Pacific Islanders, and Whites. Thus, identifying ethnic differences in symptom descriptors and airway responsiveness may improve health outcomes by educating health professionals about treatment decisions that are culturally and ethnically sensitive. METHODS: Specific Inclusion criteria-forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) &gt;or= 70% predicted normal; provocative concentration causing a 30% fall in FEV(1) (PC(30)) &lt;or= 8 mg/ml for methacholine (MCh), using only a beta(2)- inhaler, and self-reported ethnicity of African American, Hispanic-Mexican American, Asian-Pacific Islander, or White. Serial pulmonary function test (PFT) and Borg, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Ethnic Word Descriptors (EWDs) were collected. RESULTS: One hundred eighteen consented, 106 completed procedures, and 90 had a positive PC(30) and were enrolled. Asian-Pacific Islanders had significantly greater airway responsiveness (p &lt;.02). Baseline FEV(1), MCh dose, and PC(30) correlated with race (p &lt;.001); baseline FEV(1) and ethnicity predicted airway responsiveness (p &lt;.001). EWDs differed significantly by ethnicity. Upper airway EWDs for Asian-Pacific Islanders: itchy throat (p &lt; .04), itchy (p &lt;.02), itchy back throat (p &lt;.04), voice tight, tight throat (p &lt;.001), and cough (p &lt;.04). Upper airway EWDs for African Americans: add itchy throat (p &lt;.002), itchy neck (p &lt;.001), tight throat (p &lt;.003), voice tight (p &lt;.02), and cough (p &lt;.04). Hispanic-Mexican Americans used both upper and lower airway EWDs; Whites used only lower airway EWDs. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights about ethnic differences in airway responsiveness and EWDs. Asian-Pacific Islanders required a significantly smaller dose of MCh to achieve a PC(30) compared to the other three ethnic groups. The upper airway EWDs used by African Americans, Asian-Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic-Mexican Americans indicate a shared <e>language</e> of symptoms. A new language of breathlessness that incorporates both cultural and ethnic differences is needed to address the present disparity in the management of asthma symptoms.",M2
20524834,"Determinants of U.S. poison center utilization.CONTEXT: High poison center utilization has been associated with decreased emergency department usage and hospitalization rates. However, utilization requires awareness of the poison center. Penetrance, defined as the number of human poison exposures reported to a poison center per 1,000 population, has been used as a marker of poison center awareness. OBJECTIVES: To identify factors that influence poison center penetrance to optimize the life- and cost-saving benefits of poison control centers. METHODS: Human poison exposures that were reported to the National Poison Data System in 2001 were analyzed to identify and rank factors affecting poison center penetrance. RESULTS: Overall penetrance correlated with pediatric penetrance (R(2) = 0.75, p &lt; 0.01). As pediatric penetrance increased, there was a significant decline in the percent of children reported to a poison center that were already in or en route to a healthcare facility at the time of the call to the poison center (R(2) = 0.41, p &lt; 0.01). Larger poison center service populations were associated with lower penetrance (R(2) = 0.23, p &lt; 0.01). Inverse predictors of penetrance included inability to speak English well, Black/African American race, and distance from the poison center (multiple regression). Positive predictors included the percentage of the population younger than 5 years, the percentage of the adult population with a bachelor's degree, poison center certification, poison center educator FTEs (full time equivalents), Asian population percentage, and population density. DISCUSSION: The inverse correlation between pediatric penetrance and healthcare facility utilization supports prior observations of excessive healthcare utilization when a poison center is not called. Since race, <e>language</e> and distance are barriers to poison center utilization, and since healthcare utilization increases when poison center penetrance declines, low penetrance suggests a lack of awareness of the poison center rather than a low incidence of poisonings. CONCLUSION: Strategies to raise penetrance should be informed by an understanding of the barriers to utilization - language, Black/African American race, distance from the poison center, poverty, and lower education levels.",M2

Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we provide the first direct statistically based investigation into how the effect of dyslexia on brain activation is influenced by the Chinese and English writing systems. Brain activation for semantic decisions on written words was compared in English dyslexics, Chinese dyslexics, English normal readers and Chinese normal readers, while controlling for all other experimental parameters. By investigating the effects of dyslexia and language in one study, we show common activation in Chinese and English dyslexics despite different activation in Chinese versus English normal readers. The effect of dyslexia in both languages was observed as less than normal activation in the left angular gyrus and in left middle frontal, posterior temporal and occipitotemporal regions. Differences in Chinese and English normal reading were observed as increased activation for Chinese relative to English in the left inferior frontal sulcus; and increased activation for English relative to Chinese in the left posterior superior temporal sulcus. These cultural differences were not observed in dyslexics who activated both left inferior frontal sulcus and left posterior superior temporal sulcus, consistent with the use of culturally independent strategies when reading is less efficient. By dissociating the effect of dyslexia from differences in Chinese and English normal reading, our results reconcile brain activation results with a substantial body of behavioural studies showing commonalities in the cognitive manifestation of dyslexia in Chinese and English populations. They also demonstrate the influence of cognitive ability and learning environment on a common neural system for reading.",M2

Instances of ironic <e>language</e> in conversations between mothers, fathers, and their two children (M(ages) = 6.33and4.39years) were recorded during six 90-min observations for each of 39 families. Children's responses to others' ironic utterances were coded for their understanding of meaning and conversational function. Mothers were especially likely to ask rhetorical questions and to use ironic language in conflictual contexts. In contrast, fathers used hyperbole and understatement as frequently as rhetorical questions, and employed ironic language in both positive and conflictual contexts. Children also showed evidence of a nascent ability to use ironic language, especially hyperbole and rhetorical questions. Family members used rhetorical questions and understatement proportionately more often in a negative interaction context. Finally, older siblings understood irony better than younger siblings, and both children's responses revealed some understanding of ironic language, particularly sarcasm and rhetorical questions. Overall, the results suggest that family conversations in the home may be one important context for the development of children's use and understanding of ironic language.",M2

However, because there are strong commonalities across languages in the placement of color-term boundaries, the question remains open whether observed categorical perception for color can be entirely a result of learned categories or may rely to some degree on innate ones. We show here that lateralized color categorical perception can be entirely the result of learned categories. In a visual search task, reaction times to targets were faster in the right than the left visual field when the target and distractor colors, initially sharing the same linguistic term (e.g.,  blue ), became between-category colors after training (i.e., when two different shades of blue had each acquired a new name). A control group, whose conditions exactly matched those of the experimental group except that no new categories were introduced, did not show this effect, establishing that the effect was not dependent on increased familiarity with either the color stimuli or the task. The present results show beyond question that lateralized categorical perception of color can reflect strictly learned color categories, even artificially learned categories that violate both universal tendencies in color naming and the categorization pattern of the language of the subject.",M2
20466762,"Left hemisphere regions are critical for <e>language</e> in the face of early left focal brain injury.A predominant theory regarding early stroke and its effect on language development, is that early left hemisphere lesions trigger compensatory processes that allow the right hemisphere to assume dominant language functions, and this is thought to underlie the near normal language development observed after early stroke. To test this theory, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain activity during category fluency in participants who had sustained pre- or perinatal left hemisphere stroke (n = 25) and in neurologically normal siblings (n = 27). In typically developing children, performance of a category fluency task elicits strong involvement of left frontal and lateral temporal regions and a lesser involvement of right hemisphere structures. In our cohort of atypically developing participants with early stroke, expressive and receptive language skills correlated with activity in the same left inferior frontal regions that support language processing in neurologically normal children. This was true independent of either the amount of brain injury or the extent that the injury was located in classical cortical language processing areas. Participants with bilateral activation in left and right superior temporal-inferior parietal regions had better language function than those with either predominantly left- or right-sided unilateral activation. The advantage conferred by left inferior frontal and bilateral temporal involvement demonstrated in our study supports a strong predisposition for typical neural language organization, despite an intervening injury, and argues against models suggesting that the right hemisphere fully accommodates language function following early injury.",M2

Additionally, drugs used to control weight gain could occasionally create untoward effects in cardiovascular functions, as well as in behaviors, memory, sleep, and emotions because the molecular machinery responsible for ingestion control is interconnected with or shared by the above domains. How each group of drugs preserves the privacy of its message in the mutual network is not fully understood. In the present essay, the graph theory approach was used to explore some aspects of molecular signaling as though they were a 'language'. Its emphasis is on 'molecular polysemy', a term that refers to the ability of biomolecules to be used like words in natural languages more than one-way.

Survey and interview data were gathered from staff (n = 17) and Latino clients (n = 30). The data indicate that clients felt satisfied with interpreters. Some friction existed between the interpreters and the medical staff due to incongruent expectations.

The study offers important insight into how ad hoc interpreters can become professional medical interpreters within a limited-resource service environment.",M2
20445094,"Colloquium paper: the cognitive niche: coevolution of intelligence, sociality, and <e>language</e>.Although Darwin insisted that human intelligence could be fully explained by the theory of evolution, the codiscoverer of natural selection, Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that abstract intelligence was of no use to ancestral humans and could only be explained by intelligent design. Wallace's apparent paradox can be dissolved with two hypotheses about human cognition. One is that intelligence is an adaptation to a knowledge-using, socially interdependent lifestyle, the  cognitive niche.  This embraces the ability to overcome the evolutionary fixed defenses of plants and animals by applications of reasoning, including weapons, traps, coordinated driving of game, and detoxification of plants. Such reasoning exploits intuitive theories about different aspects of the world, such as objects, forces, paths, places, states, substances, and other people's beliefs and desires. The theory explains many zoologically unusual traits in Homo sapiens, including our complex toolkit, wide range of habitats and diets, extended childhoods and long lives, hypersociality, complex mating, division into cultures, and language (which multiplies the benefit of knowledge because know-how is useful not only for its practical benefits but as a trade good with others, enhancing the evolution of cooperation). The second hypothesis is that humans possess an ability of metaphorical abstraction, which allows them to coopt faculties that originally evolved for physical problem-solving and social coordination, apply them to abstract subject matter, and combine them productively. These abilities can help explain the emergence of abstract cognition without supernatural or exotic evolutionary forces and are in principle testable by analyses of statistical signs of selection in the human genome.",M2
20445088,"Colloquium paper: a role for relaxed selection in the evolution of the <e>language</e> capacity.Explaining the extravagant complexity of the human language and our competence to acquire it has long posed challenges for natural selection theory. To answer his critics, Darwin turned to sexual selection to account for the extreme development of language. Many contemporary evolutionary theorists have invoked incredibly lucky mutation or some variant of the assimilation of acquired behaviors to innate predispositions in an effort to explain it. Recent evodevo approaches have identified developmental processes that help to explain how complex functional synergies can evolve by Darwinian means. Interestingly, many of these developmental mechanisms bear a resemblance to aspects of Darwin's mechanism of natural selection, often differing only in one respect (e.g., form of duplication, kind of variation, competition/cooperation). A common feature is an interplay between processes of stabilizing selection and processes of relaxed selection at different levels of organism function. These may play important roles in the many levels of evolutionary process contributing to language. Surprisingly, the relaxation of selection at the organism level may have been a source of many complex synergistic features of the human language capacity, and may help explain why so much language information is  inherited  socially.",M2
20445059,"Gesture discrimination in primary progressive aphasia: the intersection between gesture and <e>language</e> processing pathways.The issue of the relationship between language and gesture processing and the partial overlap of their neural representations is of fundamental importance to neurology, psychology, and social sciences. Patients suffering from primary progressive aphasia, a clinical syndrome characterized by comparatively isolated language deficits, may provide direct evidence for anatomical and functional association between specific language deficits and gesture discrimination deficits. A consecutive series of 16 patients with primary progressive aphasia and 16 matched control subjects participated. Our nonverbal gesture discrimination task consisted of 19 trials. In each trial, participants observed three video clips showing the same gesture performed correctly in one clip and incorrectly in the other two. Subjects had to indicate which of the three versions was correct. Language and gesture production were evaluated by means of conventional tasks. All participants underwent high-resolution structural and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. Ten of the primary progressive aphasia patients showed a significant deficit on the nonverbal gesture discrimination task. A factor analysis revealed that this deficit clustered with gesture imitation, word and pseudoword repetition, and writing-to-dictation. Individual scores on this cluster correlated with volume in the left anterior inferior parietal cortex extending into the posterior superior temporal gyrus. Probabilistic tractography indicated this region comprised the cortical relay station of the indirect pathway connecting the inferior frontal gyrus and the superior temporal cortex. Thus, the left perisylvian temporoparietal area may underpin verbal imitative behavior, gesture imitation, and gesture discrimination indicative of a partly shared neural substrate for language and gesture resonance.",M2
20434628,"[French validation of the modified version of the SAS]INTRODUCTION: According to research in sport psychology, anxiety is one of the most important and studied topics. Since its conceptualisation, many scales assessing sport anxiety have appeared in the English <e>language</e>. At present, the multidimensional conceptualisation of anxiety is dominant. Smith et al. developed a self-report questionnaire to assess the anxiety trait in sport (Sport Anxiety Scale, SAS). As a consequence, it seems important to have such an instrument in French language in order to fill in questionnaires on lack of self-report so as to assess cognitive and somatic anxiety traits. LITERATURE FINDINGS: The SAS was developed with 30 items in two factors: somatic anxiety and cognitive anxiety. However, the final version of the SAS had 24 items in three factors. A third factor was identified during factorial analyses: concentration disruption. Sarason's researches corroborate in part this third factor with the theory of cognitive interferences. Dunn et al. underlined the theoretical incoherence of this assumption. In the same way, Neil et al. suggested the deletion of this third dimension. AIM OF THE STUDY: Considering all these results, the aim of this study is to suggest a French translation of the SAS, taking into account the modified version suggested by Neil et al. METHOD AND PROCEDURE: The scale was translated according to Vallerand's process. Two hundred and seven sportsmen (135 boys and 71 girls) aged 20 years (S.D.=2.5 years) filled out the scale on site. A Confirmatory Factorial Analysis (CFA) using the LISREL 8.30((c)) software was conducted. ANOVAs were also carried out to compare trait anxiety scores as a function of gender; level and type of sport. RESULTS: The CFA results on both models are acceptable (chi(2)/ddl=1.60, Comparative fit index (CFI)=0.98, Global fit index (GFI)=0.92, Standardized root mean square residual (SRMR)=0.05, Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.05) and Cronbach's alpha for each scale ranged from 0.86 for cognitive trait anxiety to 0.89 for somatic trait anxiety. The ANOVAs show a difference according to gender (girls were more anxious than boys); level (the higher the level, the more the sportsmen were anxious) and type of sport (those who practiced collective sports were more anxious than those who practised individual sports). To conclude, and waiting for other researches using the French version of SAS, it appears that this scale is generally acceptable, and can be a useful tool for research on the anxiety trait in sport.",M2
20429752,"Clinical fMRI of <e>language</e> function in aphasic patients: reading paradigm successful, while word generation paradigm fails.BACKGROUND: In fMRI examinations, it is very important to select appropriate paradigms assessing the brain function of interest. In addition, the patients' ability to perform the required cognitive tasks during fMRI must be taken into account. PURPOSE: To evaluate two language paradigms, word generation and sentence reading for their usefulness in examinations of aphasic patients and to make suggestions for improvements of clinical fMRI. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five patients with aphasia after stroke or trauma sequelae were examined by fMRI. The patients' language ability was screened by neurolinguistic tests and elementary pre-fMRI language tests. RESULTS: The sentence-reading paradigm succeeded to elicit adequate language-related activation in perilesional areas whereas the word generation paradigm failed. These findings were consistent with results on the behavioral tests in that all patients showed very poor performance in phonemic fluency, but scored well above mean at a reading comprehension task. CONCLUSION: The sentence-reading paradigm is appropriate to assess language function in this patient group, while the word-generation paradigm seems to be inadequate. In addition, it is crucial to use elementary pre-fMRI language tests to guide the fMRI paradigm decision.",M2
20428690,"Multidimensional pain evaluation scale.This study developed a pain evaluation scale and validated it for the Portuguese <e>language</e>. Development of the inventory--308 readily available pain descriptors--were searched in international literature and validated by six judges. One hundred descriptors of acute pain and 100 descriptors of chronic pain were found, which were used in the next stage. Statistical validation--493 health professionals and 146 patients experiencing acute and chronic pain participated in the study. Instructions, pain descriptors and respective definitions, pen and measuring tape were provided to participants. Psychophysical methods were used to establish categories, magnitude and cross-modality matching using line-length. Results revealed the ranking of the most frequently used descriptors of acute and chronic pain, with power equal to 0.99, close to the predicted (one), using line-length estimations. The Multidimensional Pain Evaluation Scale is thus validated for the Portuguese language.",M2
20425648,"Differentiation of the pattern of cognitive impairment between depressed and non-depressed patients with dementia living in long-term care facilities.OBJECTIVE: The principal objective of this study is to examine the cognitive profile of patients with dementia plus (D+ group) and without (D- group) concomitant depression. METHOD: The D+ (N = 61) and D- (N = 89) patients were recruited in long-term care facilities. The depression status of the participants was determined using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Cognitive functioning was assessed using the Hierarchic Dementia Scale (HDS). RESULTS: The analyses first indicated that on the total HDS score, patients of the D+ group exhibited more severe cognitive impairment compared to those of the D- group. Further analyses revealed that the difference between groups pertained to perception, attention/memory, calculation, and <e>language</e> functions. Moreover, secondary analyses revealed that the cognitive deficits of the D+ group were associated with behavioral (agitation and retardation, in particular), but not with mood-related, symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ideational symptoms of depression (suicide and self-depreciation, in particular) were positively correlated with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: These findings add to those of previous studies showing that D+ and D- patients differ not only regarding the presence or absence of depressive symptoms, but also regarding cognitive manifestations. This study thus reinforces the need to detect and treat accurately depression in dementia.",M2
20423446,"<e>Language</e> consistency: a missing link in theory, research and reasoning?AIM: This paper is a report of a study conducted to determine if there is a lack of language consistency in nursing texts and among nursing educators related to theory, research and reasoning. BACKGROUND: Analysis of international language, communication and nursing literature revealed the essential role language consistency plays in promoting competency and desirable behavioural outcomes. It also revealed the difficulty nursing has had in gaining consistency of language associated with theory, research and reasoning. METHOD: Six nursing theory, research and terminology texts with international circulation were analysed to identify key words related to theory, research and reasoning and to determine consistency of definitions among texts. Next, 97 nursing educators were surveyed to determine their ability to define the same key words. Educators were recruited during three national nursing education meetings in the United States of America between 2006 and 2007. FINDINGS: Analysis revealed significant variability in definitions of key words among texts and in nursing educators' ability to match any defining words used by the texts and by each other. CONCLUSION: Epistemologically, the use of inconsistent language among texts and educators may be playing a role in the continuing marginalization of theory, research and reasoning in nursing education and practice; ultimately, hindering the profession's epistemological growth. Recommendations include a call for consensus of key words and meanings associated with theory, research and reasoning and the development of a language essentials document to support development of competency.",M2
20422920,"Implementation of multiple intelligences theory in the English <e>language</e> course syllabus at the University of Nis Medical School.INTRODUCTION: Theory of multiple intelligences (MI) is considered an innovation in learning the English language because it helps students develop all eight intelligences that, on the other hand, represent ways people understand the world around them, solve problems and learn. They are: verbal/linguistic, logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, bodily/kinaesthetic, musical/rhythmic, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalist. Also, by focusing on the problem-solving activities, teachers, by implementing theory of multiple intelligences, encourage students not only to build their existing language knowledge but also learn new content and skills. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study has been to determine the importance of implementation of the theory of multiple intelligences in the English language course syllabus at the University of Nis Medical School. METHODS: Ways in which the theory of multiple intelligences has been implemented in the English language course syllabus particularly in one lecture for junior year students of pharmacy in the University of Nis Medical School. RESULTS: The English language final exam results from February 2009 when compared with the final exam results from June 2007 prior to the implementation of MI theory showed the following: out of 80 junior year students of pharmacy, 40 obtained grade 10 (outstanding), 16 obtained grade 9 (excellent), 11 obtained grade 8 (very good), 4 obtained grade 7 (good) and 9 obtained grade 6 (pass). No student failed. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the theory of multiple intelligences in the English language course syllabus at the University of Nis Medical School has had a positive impact on learning the English language and has increased students' interest in language learning. Genarally speaking, this theory offers better understanding of students' intelligence and greater appreciation of their strengths. It provides numerous opportunities for students to use and develop all eight intelligences not just the few they excel in prior to enrolling in a university or college.",M2

First, we describe new algorithmic methods for unsupervised learning of generative grammars from raw CHILDES data and give an account of the generative performance of the acquired grammars. Next, we summarize findings from recent longitudinal and experimental work that suggests how certain statistically prominent structural properties of child-directed speech may facilitate language acquisition. We then present a series of new analyses of CHILDES data indicating that the desired properties are indeed present in realistic child-directed speech corpora. Finally, we suggest how our computational results, behavioral findings, and corpus-based insights can be integrated into a next-generation model aimed at meeting the four requirements of our modeling framework.",M2
20418073,"Gray matter volume differences specific to formal thought disorder in schizophrenia.Formal thought disorder (FTD) is one of the main symptoms of schizophrenia. To date there are no whole brain volumetric studies investigating gray matter (GM) differences specifically associated with FTD. Here, we studied 20 right-handed schizophrenia patients that differed in the severity of formal thought disorder and 20 matched healthy controls, using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The severity of FTD was measured with the Scale for the Assessment of Thought, <e>Language</e>, and Communication. The severity was negatively correlated with the GM volume of the left superior temporal sulcus, the left temporal pole, the right middle orbital gyrus and the right cuneus/lingual gyrus. Structural abnormalities specific for FTD were found to be unrelated to GM differences associated with schizophrenia in general. The specific GM abnormalities within the left temporal lobe may help to explain language disturbances included in FTD.",M2
20415004,"Intonational structure as a word-boundary cue in Tokyo Japanese.While listeners are recognizing words from the connected speech stream, they are also parsing information from the intonational contour. This contour may contain cues to word boundaries, particularly if a <e>language</e> has boundary tones that occur at a large proportion of word onsets. We investigate how useful the pitch rise at the beginning of an accentual phrase (APR) would be as a potential word-boundary cue for Japanese listeners. A corpus study shows that it should allow listeners to locate approximately 40-60% of word onsets, while causing less than 1% false positives. We then present a word-spotting study which shows that Japanese listeners can, indeed, use accentual phrase boundary cues during segmentation. This work shows that the prosodic patterns that have been found in the production of Japanese also impact listeners' processing.",M2

20404709,"Validation of a translated version of the modified Japanese orthopaedic association score to assess outcomes in cervical spondylotic myelopathy: an approach to globalize outcomes assessment tools.BACKGROUND: Although the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) originally developed in Japan, the modified English version (mJOA) has become widely used and is arguably now the accepted standard. OBJECTIVE: In order to apply the mJOA successfully at an international level, we have translated it with a validated approach into Dutch to pave the way for other translated versions. METHODS: After a thorough forward and backward translation procedure, a final Dutch version of the mJOA was developed. This translated version was used to assess the interobserver reliability among 2 independent examiners by using a cohort of patients with neurological impairment due to spinal pathology. RESULTS: The mJOA grading scale was used by 2 independent examiners in 25 patients with a variety of spinal diseases. Initially, the interobserver reliability expressed as kappa was 0.56 +/- 0.11. Then, instructions were given to the instructors to refrain from providing patients with an interpretation of the symptoms. Patients were asked to restrict themselves to the questionnaire and select the most appropriate score without bias from the examiner. Kappa increased to 0.78 +/- 0.05. This difference reached statistical significance (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: We present a streamlined approach to translate the mJOA into a <e>language</e> other than English. The approach resulted in a Dutch version of the mJOA that had a high degree of interobserver reliability.",M2

I present that Hiragana, as the character for Gitai-go, was started to use by people viewed as of no public authority such as women at that time while Kanji had a position as an official characters. As unofficial character, Hiragana was received and transformed by common people as the character which is more flexible and vague suited to express persons' experience than Kanji. Most of Gitai-go is written in Hiragana, and people can also create original and personalized one based on their experience. We can be driven by necessity to search the meanings of Gitai-go when we meet unknown one, through its vagueness. This undifferentiated nature and indefinite feature of Gitai-go provide us with tension of communication.",M2
20400089,"Sign communication in Cri du chat syndrome.This paper presents findings from a study on the use of sign supported Norwegian (SSN) in two individuals with Cri du chat syndrome (CCS). The study gives a first account of some selected aspects of production and intelligibility of SSN in CCS. Possible deviance in manual parameters, in particular inter- and/or intra-subject variation in the use of handshape is investigated. Second, the question is addressed to what extent the isolated signs and isolated speech are intelligible and to what extent the combination of signs and speech in SSN contributes to a better intelligibility compared to each part in isolation. Results showed inter-subject variation, as well as individual consistency of deviancy in phonetic handshape parameters. Both participants were slightly more intelligible in their sign articulation when signs and speech production were analyzed separately. Importantly, intelligibility was greatly increased when signs and speech were combined. This emphasizes the importance of SSN for facilitating communication in children with CCS. Learning outcomes: The reader will be able to identify Signed Supported Communication as an artificial communication form, which can be used as an aid for <e>language</e> development in different groups of children, including children suffering from Cri du chat syndrome. The paper shows the reader to recognize that although children with Cri du chat do not produce words or signs accurately, their intelligibility can improve when they use simultaneous combinations of words and signs.",M2
20399492,"Bilateral brain regions associated with naming in older adults.To determine structural brain correlates of naming abilities in older adults, we tested 24 individuals aged 56-79 on two confrontation-naming tests (the Boston Naming Test (BNT) and the Action Naming Test (ANT)), then collected from these individuals structural Magnetic-Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data. Overall, several regions showed that greater gray and white matter volume/integrity measures were associated with better task performance. Left peri-Sylvian <e>language</e> regions and their right-hemisphere counterparts, plus left mid-frontal gyrus correlated with accuracy and/or negatively with response time (RT) on the naming tests. Fractional anisotropy maps derived from DTI showed robust positive correlations with ANT accuracy bilaterally in the temporal lobe and in right middle frontal lobe, as well as negative correlations with BNT RT, bilaterally, in the white matter within middle and inferior temporal lobes. We conclude that those older adults with relatively better naming skills can rely on right-hemisphere peri-Sylvian and mid-frontal regions and pathways, in conjunction with left-hemisphere peri-Sylvian and mid-frontal regions, to achieve their success.",M2
20395549,"Brain sensitivity to print emerges when children learn letter-speech sound correspondences.The acquisition of reading skills is a major landmark process in a human's cognitive development. On the neural level, a new functional network develops during this time, as children typically learn to associate the well-known sounds of their spoken <e>language</e> with unfamiliar characters in alphabetic languages and finally access the meaning of written words, allowing for later reading. A critical component of the mature reading network located in the left occipito-temporal cortex, termed the  visual word-form system  (VWFS), exhibits print-sensitive activation in readers. When and how the sensitivity of the VWFS to print comes about remains an open question. In this study, we demonstrate the initiation of occipito-temporal cortex sensitivity to print using functional MRI (fMRI) (n = 16) and event-related potentials (ERP) (n = 32) in a controlled, longitudinal training study. Print sensitivity of fast (&lt;250 ms) processes in posterior occipito-temporal brain regions accompanied basic associative learning of letter-speech sound correspondences in young (mean age 6.4 +/- 0.08 y) nonreading kindergarten children, as shown by concordant ERP and fMRI results. The occipito-temporal print sensitivity thus is established during the earliest phase of reading acquisition in childhood, suggesting that a crucial part of the later reading network first adopts a role in mapping print and sound.",M2
20392276,"The anatomy of <e>language</e>: a review of 100 fMRI studies published in 2009.In this review of 100 fMRI studies of speech comprehension and production, published in 2009, activation is reported for: prelexical speech perception in bilateral superior temporal gyri; meaningful speech in middle and inferior temporal cortex; semantic retrieval in the left angular gyrus and pars orbitalis; and sentence comprehension in bilateral superior temporal sulci. For incomprehensible sentences, activation increases in four inferior frontal regions, posterior planum temporale, and ventral supramarginal gyrus. These effects are associated with the use of prior knowledge of semantic associations, word sequences, and articulation that predict the content of the sentence. Speech production activates the same set of regions as speech comprehension but in addition, activation is reported for: word retrieval in left middle frontal cortex; articulatory planning in the left anterior insula; the initiation and execution of speech in left putamen, pre-SMA, SMA, and motor cortex; and for suppressing unintended responses in the anterior cingulate and bilateral head of caudate nuclei.

20391187,"Neuroimaging and neuropsychological follow-up study in a pediatric brain tumor patient treated with surgery and radiation.Intracranial tumors are the most common neoplasms of childhood, accounting for approximately 20% of all pediatric malignancies. Radiation therapy has led directly to significant increases in survival of children with certain types of intracranial tumors; however, given the aggressive nature of this therapy, children are at risk for exhibiting changes in brain structure, neuronal biochemistry, and neurocognitive functioning. In this case report, we present neuropsychological, magnetic resonance imaging, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging data for two adolescents (one patient with ependymal spinal cord tumor with intracranial metastases, and one healthy, typically developing control) from three time points as defined by the patient's radiation schedule (baseline before the patient's radiation therapy, 6 months following completion of the patient's radiation, and 27 months following the patient's radiation). In the patient, there were progressive decreases in gray and white matter volumes as well as early decreases in mean N-acetyl aspartate/choline (NAA/Cho) ratios and fractional anisotropy (FA) in regions with normal appearance on conventional MRI. At the last follow-up, NAA/Cho and FA tended to change in the direction to normal values in selected regions. At the same time, the patient had initial reduction in <e>language</e> and motor skills, followed by return to baseline, but later onset delay in visuospatial and visual perceptual skills.

Perception of L2 is also significantly poorer by BL listeners compared to native monolingual (ML) listeners. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of stationary and nonstationary energetic noise maskers on L1 and L2 speech perception in native and nonnative listeners. RESEARCH DESIGN: A mixed multivariate quasi-experimental design was employed. STUDY SAMPLE: Two groups of 12 ML English-speaking and BL Mandarin-English-speaking normal-hearing young adult female volunteers participated. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: An adaptive technique was employed to determine reception thresholds for sentences (RTSs) in quiet and in backgrounds of competing continuous and interrupted noise. The noises differed only in their temporal continuity. The sentence stimuli employed consisted of the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) and the Mandarin Hearing in Noise Test (MHINT). ML participants received the HINT stimuli while the BL participants received both HINT and MHINT stimuli. Between-group differences in RTSs were examined for the same stimuli (i.e., HINT) and for L1 stimuli (i.e., HINT vs. MHINT). Within-group differences in RTSs were examined with the BL participants' perception of L1 and L2 stimuli (i.e., MHINT vs. HINT). The amount of  release from masking  (i.e., the difference of RTS signal-to-noise ratios [SNRs] in interrupted and continuous noise) was also examined between and within groups. RESULTS: In quiet there was no significant difference in mean RTSs between the BL and ML participants with their respective L1 stimuli; MLs had significantly lower mean RTSs in English compared to the BLs; and mean RTSs for the BLs were significantly lower for L1 versus L2 stimulus. In noise, a significantly higher RTS SNR was found for the MLs in continuous noise but not interrupted noise for L1 stimuli compared to the BLs; BLs had a significantly higher mean RTSs in English compared to the MLs; and BLs had significantly higher mean RTSs for L2 versus L1 stimuli. The release from masking was significantly greater for MLs compared to BLs with their respective L1 stimuli and with the same English stimuli. There was no significant difference for the BLs' release from masking with L1 versus L2 stimulus. CONCLUSION: BL listeners display significantly poorer performance when perceiving nonnative L2 sentences in quiet and in continuous and interrupted noise relative ML listeners. When listening to their respective native L1 sentences, only a difference in continuous noise was found. This difference was attributed to differential masking effect on the English stimuli. Similar performance in the interrupted noise between the ML and BL participants with L1 stimuli and the equivalent release from masking with the BL participants for both L1 and L2 stimuli suggest comparable basic auditory temporal resolving capacities between these ethnic groups.",M2

Comparisons with other disorders (Specific <e>Language</e> Impairment (SLI) and phonological dyslexia) and the possibility of reading remediation in CAS warrant further research. This case study describes the speech, language, cognitive, and literacy deficits and therapy gains in a girl aged 11;6 with severe CAS and borderline IQ. A comprehensive assessment of literacy-related cognitive skills, including phonological memory and working memory capacity, language, speech production and reading skills, was administered. Treatment from 6;0 to 11;6 targeted speech sounds, oral sequencing, phonological awareness (PA), speech-print connections, syllabic structure, and real and non-word decoding. Phonological memory was similar to that of children with SLI, but working memory was significantly worse. Unlike children with phonological dyslexia, our participant demonstrated relative strength in letter-sound correspondence rules. Despite deficits, she made progress in literacy with intensive long-term intervention. Results suggest that the underlying cognitive-linguistic profile of children with CAS may differ from those of children with SLI or dyslexia. Our results also show that long-term intensive intervention promotes acquisition of adequate literacy skills even in a child with a severe motor speech disorder and borderline IQ.",M2
20380248,"Assessing frequency effects on verb inflection use by Spanish-speaking individuals with agrammatism: theoretical and clinical implications.The resistance of high-frequency linguistic elements to aphasic impairment suggests that frequency of occurrence may be implicated in verb use differences in agrammatic aphasia. The highly-inflected Spanish verb system allows for the examination of frequency of occurrence along two main metrics, daily usage frequency and paradigmatic frequency. In this study, we explored the role of those two frequency dimensions in verb repetition by Spanish speakers with agrammatism. Six native Spanish-speaking individuals with agrammatic oral expression were matched for age, education and Spanish dialect with six speakers with typical <e>language</e>. The speakers participated in a sentence repetition task involving simple verb tenses. Results revealed that high frequency in daily usage can have a stronger facilitating effect on verb repetition than paradigmatic frequency. Theoretical and clinical implications of the findings are discussed to highlight some plausible repercussions of typical discourse patterns in providing a socio-cognitive dimension to agrammatism theory and in supporting the use of frequency-based linguistic features in agrammatism therapy.",M2

This paper examines whether L2 children with longer exposure converge with their monolingual peers in the production of tense marking. Thirty-eight successive bilingual Turkish-English speaking (L2) children with a mean age of 7;8 and 33 monolingual English-speaking (L1) age-matched controls completed the screening test of the Test of Early Grammatical Impairment (TEGI). The L2 children as a group were as accurate as the controls in the production of -ed, but performed significantly lower than the controls in the production of third person -s. Age and years of exposure (YoE) affected the children's performance. The highest age-expected performance on the TEGI was attested in 8- and 9-year-old children who had 4-6 YoE. L1 and L2 children performed better in regular compared to irregular verbs, but L2 children overregularized more than L1 children and were less sensitive to the phonological properties of verbs. The results show that tense marking and the screening test of the TEGI may be promising for differential diagnosis in 8- and 9-year-old L2 children with at least four YoE.",M2

In a translation decision task, they reported whether English target words were correct translations of Spanish primes. In both the tasks, word primes were either cognates or noncognates. In the translation decision task, faster and more accurate responses were associated with reduced N400 amplitudes in word pairs featuring a cognate. However, cognates did not modulate performance or event-related potentials in the association decision task.

METHODS: 19 consecutive SD patients were examined. Symptoms were classified into 23 distinct categories: behavioral symptoms, <e>language</e> and cognitive symptoms and symptoms concerning the impairment of activities of daily living (ADL). We divided patients into two subgroups, left- and right-dominant SD, and compared the onset of each symptom. RESULTS: Language impairments occurred as the initial symptom in 16 cases. At the first examination, all cases showed both anomia and impairment of word comprehension. By around 3 years after onset, almost all language impairments were observed. Approximately 3-5 years after onset, prosopagnosia and behavioral symptoms appeared. Around the period when the loss of the language faculty and apathy became remarkable, impairment of ADL appeared. Patients spent all day in bed at this stage. Moreover, prosopagnosia appeared significantly earlier in right-dominant SD. CONCLUSION: Our findings clarify the progression of distinctive symptoms of SD patients. It is necessary to create a treatment strategy for SD patients with such a disease-specific course of SD.",M2

Mimic words in the Japanese language, including Gitai-go are applicable to various subjects based on their inter-sensory nature, and appear frequently in informal communication among Japanese, not only for young children but also in adults' communication. When I consider their functioning from the viewpoint of meaning construction, their characteristic feature is their indefiniteness that is open to diverse forms of extension, including that of no further elaboration and continuous diffusion of the affective flavor within the current setting. Though the process is interpretable in terms of the Japanese culture that is characterized by vagueness, it is also a clear exemplification of how the indefiniteness of signs works in the process of meaning construction and in our communication.",M2

In fact, according to Komatsu's (2010) discussion about the extension of meaning derived from Gitai go and its intrinsic flexible characteristics, it is possible--in terms of semiotics--to inquire into vaguely coded systems of mutual understanding, trying to make sense of the general functioning of signs through their peculiar ambiguity as well as their potential to evoke a vivid negotiation of meaning. This seems to show the openness of meaning highlighted by Gitai go, as it is to be referred to the logic of multiplicity deeply linked with the actors' feelings in the setting that could in general terms be labeled as the carnal knowledge. Furthermore, it has been arguing about the complexity of daily life experience and its close relation to a concept of  ordinary art , as the active involvement people show in imagining, changing and creating their personal experience of the world is always performed in their day-by-day frameworks, deeply suggesting a unique strive for appropriating-negotiating-contesting networks of meanings. And this is to be approached as an artistic mode of experiencing, since art too is just embedded in this ever-emerging ambivalence coming from the complex we call  ordinary life  and relating to our deep feelings of facing our futures. Along these lines I suggest that a particular role exists in communicative messages for what is labeled as  redundant  or  superfluous --since the ambivalence of those messages explicates the dialogical frame of sense-making, in everyday life as a concept of art.",M2
20368422,"Dissociating neural subsystems for grammar by contrasting word order and inflection.An important question in understanding <e>language</e> processing is whether there are distinct neural mechanisms for processing specific types of grammatical structure, such as syntax versus morphology, and, if so, what the basis of the specialization might be. However, this question is difficult to study: A given language typically conveys its grammatical information in one way (e.g., English marks  who did what to whom  using word order, and German uses inflectional morphology). American Sign Language permits either device, enabling a direct within-language comparison. During functional (f)MRI, native signers viewed sentences that used only word order and sentences that included inflectional morphology. The two sentence types activated an overlapping network of brain regions, but with differential patterns. Word order sentences activated left-lateralized areas involved in working memory and lexical access, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, the inferior parietal lobe, and the middle temporal gyrus. In contrast, inflectional morphology sentences activated areas involved in building and analyzing combinatorial structure, including bilateral inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions as well as the basal ganglia and medial temporal/limbic areas. These findings suggest that for a given linguistic function, neural recruitment may depend upon on the cognitive resources required to process specific types of linguistic cues.",M2
20368321,"Accuracy of computer-generated, spanish-<e>language</e> medicine labels.OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the accuracy of translated, Spanish-language medicine labels among pharmacies in a borough with a large Spanish-speaking population. METHODS: A cross-sectional, telephone survey of all pharmacies in the Bronx, New York, was performed. Selected pharmacies were visited to learn about the computer software being used to generate Spanish medicine labels. Outcomes included the proportion of pharmacies providing Spanish medicine labels, frequency of computerized translation, and description of Spanish medicine labels produced. RESULTS: Of 316 pharmacies, 286 (91%) participated. Overall, 209 (73%) provided medicine labels in Spanish. Independent pharmacies were significantly more likely to provide Spanish labels than were hospital or chain pharmacies (88% vs 57% vs 32%; P &lt; .0001). Pharmacies that provided Spanish labels mostly commonly (86%) used computer programs to do so; 11% used lay staff members, and 3% used a professional interpreter. We identified 14 different computer programs used to generate Spanish labels, with 70% of pharmacies using 1 of 3 major programs. We evaluated 76 medicine labels generated by 13 different computer programs. Overall, 32 Spanish labels (43%) included incomplete translations (a mixture of English and Spanish), and 6 additional labels contained misspellings or grammar errors, which resulted in an overall error rate of 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Although pharmacies were likely to provide medicine labels translated into Spanish, the quality of the translations was inconsistent and potentially hazardous. Unless regulations and funding support the technological advances needed to ensure the safety of such labeling, we risk perpetuating health disparities for populations with limited English proficiency.",M2
20365811,"Modeling discrete combinatorial systems as alphabetic bipartite networks: theory and applications.Genes and human <e>languages</e> are discrete combinatorial systems (DCSs), in which the basic building blocks are finite sets of elementary units: nucleotides or codons in a DNA sequence, and letters or words in a language. Different combinations of these finite units give rise to potentially infinite numbers of genes or sentences. This type of DCSs can be represented as an alphabetic bipartite network (ABN) where there are two kinds of nodes, one type represents the elementary units while the other type represents their combinations. Here, we extend and generalize recent analytical findings for ABNs derived in [Peruani, Europhys. Lett. 79, 28001 (2007)] and empirically investigate two real world systems in terms of ABNs, the codon gene and the phoneme-language network. The one-mode projections onto the elementary basic units are also studied theoretically as well as in real world ABNs. We propose the use of ABNs as a means for inferring the mechanisms underlying the growth of real world DCSs.",M2

20360468,"The internal validity and acceptability of the Danish SI-3: a <e>language</e>-screening instrument for 3-year-olds.PURPOSE: To document the development of a new parent- and day care-administered screening instrument (the Screening Instrument for 3-Year-Olds [SI-3]) to be used in a newly implemented, educationally motivated population language screening in Denmark. The authors investigated whether the basic principles of the SI-3 were working satisfactorily and studied the acceptability of the instrument. METHOD: To examine the general properties of the SI-3, 517 children from a population-based sample were screened with the SI-3 instrument, which assesses various receptive and productive language dimensions on the basis of parental checklists and day care staff-administered structured tests. To examine the acceptability of the SI-3, 2 questionnaires were administered and completed by 291 parents and 135 preschool teachers. Result We obtained a distribution with sufficient negative skew to differentiate among children with low scores, and the instrument displayed acceptable psychometric properties for most subscales. Results of the acceptability study suggest that the acceptability of the SI-3 is high among parents and day care staff, which supports a high attendance rate. CONCLUSION: The SI-3 captures a variety of language skills and is good at differentiating children in the lower end of the tail; it is thereby suitable for population language screening, although results indicated the need for some revision.",M2
20360464,"Production of tense morphology by Afrikaans-speaking children with and without specific <e>language</e> impairment.PURPOSE: To establish whether the predictions of the extended optional infinitive (EOI) hypothesis (Rice, Wexler, &amp; Cleave, 1995) hold for the language of Afrikaans-speaking children with specific language impairment (SLI) and whether tense marking is a possible clinical marker of SLI in Afrikaans. METHOD: Production of tense morphology was examined in 3 groups of Afrikaans-speaking children-15 with SLI who were 6 years old, 15 typically developing (TD) 4-year-olds matched on mean length of utterance, and 15 TD 6-year-olds-using both elicited and spontaneously produced verb forms. RESULTS: On the sentence completion task, children with SLI fared on par with 4-year-olds and worse than age-matched peers. However, in terms of spontaneous production of morphemes pertaining to tense, children with SLI fared worse than both TD groups. Furthermore, children with SLI mostly made the same types of errors as 4-year-olds, although some errors were unique to the SLI group. Most errors entailed omissions, of modal and temporal auxiliaries as well as of copula be. CONCLUSION: The errors offer support for the EOI hypothesis. Tense marking has the potential to be a clinical marker of SLI in Afrikaans, but further research with larger groups of Afrikaans-speaking children, including children of other ages, is needed to confirm this.",M2

20359410,"Use of information and communication technology to provide health information: what do older migrants know, and what do they need to know?BACKGROUND: Governments and businesses are increasingly using the internet and mobile telephones to disseminate information about services and products. However, not all population groups have the resources and capabilities to support equality of access to and use of these technologies. While Australia's ageing population receives attention in a wide variety of literatures, the ageing migrant population has received very little attention in relation to understanding their place in the 'digital divide'. It is not known how this group gathers information used in everyday living, or what role the internet or mobile phones plays within this. At a time when the population is ageing and there is an increasing use of the internet to deliver services and information, there is little research on the effects of ethnicity, migration, socio-economic status, education or gender of older people on the use of information and communication technology (ICT). Addressing this should be a priority in Australia, which has an old and ageing population that includes many post-war migrants from non-English speaking European countries. AIMS: To analyse the views of older migrants living in South Australia with respect to their current information sources, their use of ICT and any barriers and enablers to future use of ICT for accessing health information. METHODS: A qualitative study employing eight focus groups involving 43 older Italian and Greek migrants living in the community in metropolitan or regional settings in South Australia. Interviews were held and audio-recorded and the English <e>language</e> components transcribed. Transcriptions were analysed manually using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Older migrants do not use ICT to a great extent to access information in their everyday lives, with many expressing no interest in learning how to do so. However, they access the information they need to function in society with a desired quality of life from multiple sources by various means. Sources include electronic and print media from Australia and their home countries, family and acquaintances, government departments or service providers. Many expressed a preference for receiving information as printed material or directly from another person. DISCUSSION: Governments or primary healthcare organisations planning to make health information solely available via ICT should be aware that doing so may lead to an increase in 'information exclusion' and the formation of functional knowledge deficits for older migrants. At the moment at least, our participants do not perceive any functional knowledge deficits as they engage multiple sources to access the information they need for everyday life. We recommend that governments and healthcare organisations evaluate the appropriateness of using ICT to directly provide information to older migrants and consider non-digital means or the engagement of 'information brokers' when communicating with groups identified as low or non-users of ICT.",M2
20356404,"Little genetic differentiation as assessed by uniparental markers in the presence of substantial <e>language</e> variation in peoples of the Cross River region of Nigeria.BACKGROUND: The Cross River region in Nigeria is an extremely diverse area linguistically with over 60 distinct languages still spoken today. It is also a region of great historical importance, being a) adjacent to the likely homeland from which Bantu-speaking people migrated across most of sub-Saharan Africa 3000-5000 years ago and b) the location of Calabar, one of the largest centres during the Atlantic slave trade. Over 1000 DNA samples from 24 clans representing speakers of the six most prominent languages in the region were collected and typed for Y-chromosome (SNPs and microsatellites) and mtDNA markers (Hypervariable Segment 1) in order to examine whether there has been substantial gene flow between groups speaking different languages in the region. In addition the Cross River region was analysed in the context of a larger geographical scale by comparison to bordering Igbo speaking groups as well as neighbouring Cameroon populations and more distant Ghanaian communities. RESULTS: The Cross River region was shown to be extremely homogenous for both Y-chromosome and mtDNA markers with language spoken having no noticeable effect on the genetic structure of the region, consistent with estimates of inter-language gene flow of 10% per generation based on sociological data. However the groups in the region could clearly be differentiated from others in Cameroon and Ghana (and to a lesser extent Igbo populations). Significant correlations between genetic distance and both geographic and linguistic distance were observed at this larger scale. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have found significant correlations between genetic variation and language in Africa over large geographic distances, often across language families. However the broad sampling strategies of these datasets have limited their utility for understanding the relationship within language families. This is the first study to show that at very fine geographic/linguistic scales language differences can be maintained in the presence of substantial gene flow over an extended period of time and demonstrates the value of dense sampling strategies and having DNA of known and detailed provenance, a practice that is generally rare when investigating sub-Saharan African demographic processes using genetic data.",M2
20351276,"Evaluating the Farming/<e>Language</e> Dispersal Hypothesis with genetic variation exhibited by populations in the Southwest and Mesoamerica.The Farming/Language Dispersal Hypothesis posits that prehistoric population expansions, precipitated by the innovation or early adoption of agriculture, played an important role in the uneven distribution of language families recorded across the world. In this case, the most widely spread language families today came to be distributed at the expense of those that have more restricted distributions. In the Americas, Uto-Aztecan is one such language family that may have been spread across Mesoamerica and the American Southwest by ancient farmers. We evaluated this hypothesis with a large-scale study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosomal DNA variation in indigenous populations from these regions. Partial correlation coefficients, determined with Mantel tests, show that Y-chromosome variation in indigenous populations from the American Southwest and Mesoamerica correlates significantly with linguistic distances (r = 0.33-0.384; P &lt; 0.02), whereas mtDNA diversity correlates significantly with only geographic distance (r = 0.619; P = 0.002). The lack of correlation between mtDNA and Y-chromosome diversity is consistent with differing population histories of males and females in these regions. Although unlikely, if groups of Uto-Aztecan speakers were responsible for the northward spread of agriculture and their languages from Mesoamerica to the Southwest, this migration was possibly biased to males. However, a recent in situ population expansion within the American Southwest (2,105 years before present; 99.5% confidence interval = 1,273-3,773 YBP), one that probably followed the introduction and intensification of maize agriculture in the region, may have blurred ancient mtDNA patterns, which might otherwise have revealed a closer genetic relationship between females in the Southwest and Mesoamerica.",M2
20348233,"Impact of cultural and linguistic factors on symptom reporting by patients with cancer.BACKGROUND: Patient reporting of the severity and impact of symptoms is an essential component of cancer symptom management and cancer treatment clinical trials. In multinational clinical trials, cultural and linguistic variations in patient-reported outcomes instruments could confound the interpretation of study results. METHODS: The severity and interference of multiple symptoms in 1433 cancer patients with mixed diagnoses and treatment status from the United States, China, Japan, Russia, and Korea were measured with psychometrically validated <e>language</e> versions of the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI). Mixed-effect ordinal probit regression models were fitted to the pooled data to compare the magnitude of the effect of  country  (nation and linguistic factors) with between-subjects effects on symptom reporting, adjusted for patient and clinical factors (age, sex, performance status, and chemotherapy status). RESULTS: For the pooled sample, fatigue, disturbed sleep, distress, pain, and lack of appetite were the most severe patient-reported MDASI symptoms. The magnitude of the variance of the country random effects was only one-fourth to one-half of the interpatient variation (sigma(2) = 0.23-0.46) for all symptoms, except nausea and vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: Cultural and linguistic variations in symptom reporting among the five language versions of the validated MDASI were limited. Ordinal probit modeling provided a simple mechanism for accounting for cultural and linguistic differences in patient populations. The equivalence among MDASI translations in this study suggests that symptom ratings collected from various cultural and language groups using the MDASI can be interpreted in a similar way in oncology practice, clinical trials, and clinical research.",M2

Ten Russian-English bilingual children and 10 adults participated in this study. Nine out of 10 children participants were born in the US and used L1 as their primary language of interaction within the family, but the intensity and the length of uninterrupted L1 exposure differed for each child. All participants were tested on perception (grammaticality judgement) and production (narrative) tasks to assess their sensitivity to and retention of the morphosyntactic structure of L1. All children showed some attrition of grammatical morphemes, specifically in the Russian systems of declension and conjugation; however, the degree of attrition correlated with reading ability in L1, i.e. children with L1 reading skills showed a lesser degree of attrition for some language-specific morphosyntactic structures. This finding shows interdependence of oral and reading skills and points to the role reading in language with shallow orthography may play in preservation of L1 grammatical structures in oral language. The implications for the clinical applications are also discussed.",M2

Analyses compared the children's rate of response, complexity of the children's productions, as measured by the Phonological Mean Length of Utterance (pMLU), and the proximities of the child's productions to the adult target words, as measured by the Proportion of Whole-Word Proximity (Proximity). Response rates increased with age, and were similar for both FON and STAR. Two-year-olds had higher pMLU scores on the STAR than the FON, but no difference was found for 3-year-olds. The children overall had significantly higher Proximity scores on the STAR words. Positive correlations between vocabulary size and phonological whole-word measures on both the FON and the STAR were found.

We first assess the extent to which each of these accounts can explain the level of OI errors across five different languages (English, Dutch, German, French and Spanish). We then differentiate between the two accounts by testing their predictions about the relation between children's OI errors and the distribution of infinitival verb forms in the input language. We conclude that, although both accounts fit the cross-linguistic patterning of OI errors reasonably well, only MOSAIC is able to explain why verbs that occur more frequently as infinitives than as finite verb forms in the input also occur more frequently as OI errors than as correct finite verb forms in the children's output.",M2

Two experiments investigated Dutch and English listeners' use of preceding vowel duration as a perceptual cue for nonword-final fricative voicing in English. Dutch listeners have native language experience with the use of vowel duration for vowel length and intervocalic obstruent voicing contrasts, but not for final voicing contrasts, as Dutch does not have voiced obstruents word-finally. Previous research [Broersma, M. (2005). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 117, 3890-3901; Broersma, M.(2008) J. Acoust. Soc. Am.124, 712-715] showed that Dutch listeners used vowel duration less for final /v-f/ categorization than English listeners did when vowel duration varied only between subjects, discouraging its use as a perceptual cue. The present study assessed the use of vowel duration for final /v-f/ and /z-s/ contrasts when it varied within subjects. A goodness rating and a phonetic categorization experiment showed that Dutch listeners used vowel duration, but less than English listeners did. Thus, experience with a perceptual cue for a different contrast and for a similar contrast in a different position in the native language did not lead to native-like use of this cue in the second language.",M2
20329861,"Learning to perceptually organize speech signals in native fashion.The ability to recognize speech involves sensory, perceptual, and cognitive processes.

This experiment focused on perceptual processes, asking what accounts for how the sensory information in the speech signal gets organized. Two types of speech signals processed to remove properties that could be considered traditional acoustic cues (amplitude envelopes and sine wave replicas) were presented to 100 listeners in five groups: native English-speaking (L1) adults, 7-, 5-, and 3-year-olds, and native Mandarin-speaking adults who were excellent second-<e>language</e> (L2) users of English. The L2 adults performed more poorly than L1 adults with both kinds of signals. Children performed more poorly than L1 adults but showed disproportionately better performance for the sine waves than for the amplitude envelopes compared to both groups of adults. Sentence context had similar effects across groups, so variability in recognition was attributed to differences in perceptual organization of the sensory information, presumed to arise from native language experience.",M2

20307346,"Modeling the contribution of phonotactic cues to the problem of word segmentation.How do infants find the words in the speech stream? Computational models help us understand this feat by revealing the advantages and disadvantages of different strategies that infants might use. Here, we outline a computational model of word segmentation that aims both to incorporate cues proposed by <e>language</e> acquisition researchers and to establish the contributions different cues can make to word segmentation. We present experimental results from modified versions of Venkataraman's (2001) segmentation model that examine the utility of: (1) language-universal phonotactic cues; (2) language-specific phonotactic cues which must be learned while segmenting utterances; and (3) their combination. We show that the language-specific cue improves segmentation performance overall, but the language-universal phonotactic cue does not, and that their combination results in the most improvement. Not only does this suggest that language-specific constraints can be learned simultaneously with speech segmentation, but it is also consistent with experimental research that shows that there are multiple phonotactic cues helpful to segmentation (e.g. Mattys, Jusczyk, Luce &amp; Morgan, 1999; Mattys &amp; Jusczyk, 2001). This result also compares favorably to other segmentation models (e.g. Brent, 1999; Fleck, 2008; Goldwater, 2007; Johnson &amp; Goldwater, 2009; Venkataraman, 2001) and has implications for how infants learn to segment.",M2
20302622,"Genetic evidence supports linguistic affinity of Mlabri--a hunter-gatherer group in Thailand.BACKGROUND: The Mlabri are a group of nomadic hunter-gatherers inhabiting the rural highlands of Thailand.

This study aims to examine whether the genetic affinity of the Mlabri is consistent with this linguistic relationship, and to further explore the origins of this enigmatic population. RESULTS: We conducted a genome-wide analysis of genetic variation using more than fifty thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) typed in thirteen population samples from Thailand, including the Mlabri, Htin and neighboring populations of the Northern Highlands, speaking Austro-Asiatic, Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien languages. The Mlabri population showed higher LD and lower haplotype diversity when compared with its neighboring populations. Both model-free and Bayesian model-based clustering analyses indicated a close genetic relationship between the Mlabri and the Htin, a group speaking a Tin language. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggested that the Mlabri share more recent common ancestry with the Htin. We thus provided, to our knowledge, the first genetic evidence that supports the linguistic affinity of Mlabri, and this association between linguistic and genetic classifications could reflect the same past population processes.",M2
20300964,"On defining  mental disorder : purposes and conditions of adequacy.All definitions of mental disorder are backed up by arguments that rely on general criteria (e.g., that a definition should be consistent with ordinary <e>language</e>). These desiderata are rarely explicitly stated, and there has been no systematic discussion of how different definitions should be assessed. To arrive at a well-founded list of desiderata, we need to know the purpose of a definition.

I then propose eight conditions of adequacy that can be used to assess competing definitions (e.g., the ordinary language condition, the coherence condition, and the condition of normative adequacy). These conditions pull in different directions, however, and we must decide which are most important. I also suggest that there is no single definition that can help us deal with all the relevant practical issues.",M2

BACKGROUND: Language data were acquired beyond the spontaneous recovery period of 3 to 6 months poststroke onset. CPAP restores adequate oxygen flow throughout all stages of sleep, and may improve cognition. A series of slow, 1 Hz repetitive TMS treatments to suppress a posterior portion of right pars triangularis has been shown to improve phrase length and naming in chronic nonfluent aphasia. METHOD: The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination and Boston Naming Test were administered pre-CPAP, and after 2 to 5 months of CPAP. These same tests were administered pre-TMS, and at 3 and 6 months post-TMS, and again 2.4 years later. RESULTS: Post-CPAP testing showed increased Phrase Length, Auditory Comprehension, and naming Animals and Tools/Implements (Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination). Testing at 3 and 6 months post-TMS showed significant increase in Phrase Length, Auditory Comprehension, and Boston Naming Test compared with pre-TMS. These gains were retained at 2.4 years post-TMS.

20299814,"The Bern psychopathology scale for the assessment of system-specific psychotic symptoms.The translation from psychiatric core symptoms to brain functions and vice versa is a largely unresolved issue. In particular, the search for disorders of single brain regions explaining classical symptoms has not yielded the expected results. Based on the assumption that the psychopathology of psychosis is related to a functional imbalance of higher-order brain systems, the authors focused on three specific candidate brain circuitries, namely the <e>language</e>, and limbic and motor systems. These domains are of particular interest for understanding the disastrous communication breakdown during psychotic disorders. Core symptoms of psychosis were mapped on these domains by shaping their definitions in order to match the related brain functions. The resulting psychopathological assessment scale was tested for interrater reliability and internal consistency in a group of 168 psychotic patients. The items of the scale were reliable and a principal component analysis (PCA) was best explained by a solution resembling the three candidate systems. Based on the results, the scale was optimized as an instrument to identify patient subgroups characterized by a prevailing dysfunction of one or more of these systems. In conclusion, the scale is apt to distinguish symptom domains related to the activity of defined brain systems. PCA showed a certain degree of independence of the system-specific symptom clusters within the patient group, indicating relative subgroups of psychosis. The scale is understood as a research instrument to investigate psychoses based on a system-oriented approach. Possible immediate advantages in the clinical application of the understanding of psychoses related to system-specific symptom domains are also discussed.",M2
20299658,"Use of a smokers' quitline by Asian <e>language</e> speakers: results from 15 years of operation in California.OBJECTIVES: We examined state quitline utilization by smokers who called Chinese-, Vietnamese-, or Korean-language lines, and compared their usage rates to those of Asians and Whites calling the English-language line. METHODS: Using data from 15 years (1993-2008) of operation of the California quitline (which included data on 22 061 callers to Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese lines) and from multiple California Health Interview Surveys, we computed the call rates for Whites, English-speaking Asians, and the 3 Asian-language groups. We also examined callers' demographics and where they heard about the quitline. RESULTS: Asian smokers who spoke English were significantly less likely than English-speaking White smokers to call the quitline (odds ratios range from 0.36 to 0.62). Smokers speaking 1 of the 3 Asian languages were no less likely than White smokers to call (odds ratios range from 0.82 to 3.25). More than 80% of those calling the Asian-language lines reported hearing about the quitline through mass media. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to general expectation, smokers speaking Asian languages were just as likely to call the quitline as English-speaking White smokers. State quitlines should consider adding Asian-language lines to help address disparities in access to cessation services.",M2
20299389,"Early functional magnetic resonance imaging activations predict <e>language</e> outcome after stroke.An accurate prediction of system-specific recovery after stroke is essential to provide rehabilitation therapy based on the individual needs. We explored the usefulness of functional magnetic resonance imaging scans from an auditory language comprehension experiment to predict individual language recovery in 21 aphasic stroke patients. Subjects with an at least moderate language impairment received extensive language testing 2 weeks and 6 months after left-hemispheric stroke. A multivariate machine learning technique was used to predict language outcome 6 months after stroke. In addition, we aimed to predict the degree of language improvement over 6 months. 76% of patients were correctly separated into those with good and bad language performance 6 months after stroke when based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data from language relevant areas. Accuracy further improved (86% correct assignments) when age and language score were entered alongside functional magnetic resonance imaging data into the fully automatic classifier. A similar accuracy was reached when predicting the degree of language improvement based on imaging, age and language performance. No prediction better than chance level was achieved when exploring the usefulness of diffusion weighted imaging as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging acquired two days after stroke. This study demonstrates the high potential of current machine learning techniques to predict system-specific clinical outcome even for a disease as heterogeneous as stroke. Best prediction of language recovery is achieved when the brain activation potential after system-specific stimulation is assessed in the second week post stroke. More intensive early rehabilitation could be provided for those with a predicted poor recovery and the extension to other systems, for example, motor and attention seems feasible.",M2
20234164,"Specialist English as a foreign <e>language</e> for European public health: evaluation of competencies and needs among Polish and Lithuanian students.Foreign languages are becoming an essential prerequisite for a successful carrier among all professions including public health professionals in many countries. The expanding role of English as a mode of communication allows for university graduates to project and to seek their career in English-speaking countries. The present study was carried out in the framework of EU Leonardo da Vinci project  Specialist English as a foreign language for European public health.  The study aimed to get a deeper insight how the English language is perceived as a foreign language, by Polish and Lithuanian public health students, what is level of their language competence, which level of English proficiency they expect to use in future. MATERIAL AND METHODS. A total of 246 respondents completed the special questionnaires in autumn semester in 2005. A questionnaire form was developed by the international project team. For evaluation of English competences, the Language Passport (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages of Council of Europe) was applied. RESULTS. Current self-rated proficiency of the English language was at the same level for Lithuanian (3.47+/-1.14) and Polish (3.31+/-0.83) respondents (P&gt;0.05). Majority of respondents (88.6% of Lithuanian and 87.8% of Polish) reported using the English language for their current studies. Respondents reported a significant increase in necessity for higher level of English proficiency in future: mean scores provided by respondents changed from B1 level to B2 level. Respondents gave priority to less formal and practice-based interactive English teaching methods (going abroad, contacts with native speakers) in comparison with theory-oriented methods of learning (self-studying, Internet courses). CONCLUSIONS. Similar levels of English language in all five areas of language skills were established in Polish and Lithuanian university students. Respondents gave more priorities to less formal and practice-based interactive English teaching methods (going abroad, contacts with native speakers) in comparison with theory-oriented or classroom-based methods of learning (self-studying, Internet courses). Survey showed a growing interest of students in improving English language in the future in Poland and Lithuania.",M2
20233979,"Patient reactions to confidentiality, liability, and financial aspects of informed consent in cardiology research.BACKGROUND: Although the informed consent process is supposed to help potential research participants make informed and voluntary decisions about participating in research, little is known about how participants react to <e>language</e> in the informed consent document and whether their reactions are related to their willingness to enroll in clinical trials. We examined the relationship between patients' reactions to standard informed consent language and their willingness to participate in a hypothetical clinical trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: We simulated the consent process for a hypothetical cardiology clinical trial with 470 patients in an outpatient cardiovascular medicine clinic at a large academic medical center. We analyzed the spontaneous comments and questions that participants made during the interviews about each section of the informed consent document. Few participants made positive comments. Participants made the most negative comments about the sections on risks, study purpose or protocol, and payment for injury. Having a negative reaction to any section was associated with a lower likelihood of participating in the clinical trial. Using a multivariable model, we found that negative reactions in the patient rights, financial disclosure, and confidentiality sections predicted willingness to participate (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing elements of informed consent that elicit questions and concerns from potential research participants may help investigators design clinical research trials and model language in a way that reduces concerns or increases participant understanding, thereby enhancing informed consent for research.",M2
20230068,"Computer-mediated cross-cultural collaboration: attributing communication errors to the person versus the situation.Computer-mediated communication, such as e-mail, facilitates cross-cultural interactions by enabling convenient communication. During these exchanges, the absence of contextual or situational information may cause e-mail recipients to form dispositional explanations for behavior that might in fact be driven by unseen situational constraints. To gain insight into the manner in which e-mail recipients explain behavior, the authors conducted an experiment examining how technical <e>language</e> violations (i.e., spelling and grammatical errors) and deviations from etiquette norms (i.e., short messages lacking a conversational tone) affect a recipient's perceptions of an e-mail sender's conscientiousness, intelligence, agreeableness, extraversion, affective trustworthiness, and cognitive trustworthiness. This study also investigated whether the effects of technical and etiquette language violations depend on the availability of information indicating the e-mail sender is from a foreign culture. Results reveal that participants formed negative perceptions of the sender of an e-mail containing technical language violations. However, most of these negative perceptions were reduced when participants had situational information indicating that the e-mail sender was from a different culture. Conversely, negative attributions stemming from etiquette violations were not significantly mitigated by knowledge that the e-mail sender was from a foreign culture.",M2

Half (48 men, M age = 23.0 yr.; 51 women, M age = 22.0 yr.) were randomly assigned to receive standard instructions, and half (46 men, M age = 21.7 yr.; 52 women, M age = 21.5 yr.) were given mock job-selection instructions. The latter had a higher mean Social Desirability score, which demonstrates discriminant validity. Split-half reliability was .71. Five factors were identified, but confirmatory factor analysis indicated adequate fit with a 1- or 2-factor model. Despite the challenge of translation into Chinese (in this case, involving translation into Mandarin and back-translation by native speakers for examination by a native speaker of English), this short form appears to have adequate internal consistency reliability and discriminant validity.",M2

In this paper, we are concerned with graph-based algorithms for large-scale WSD. Under this framework, finding the right sense for a given word amounts to identifying the most  important  node among the set of graph nodes representing its senses. We introduce a graph-based WSD algorithm which has few parameters and does not require sense-annotated data for training. Using this algorithm, we investigate several measures of graph connectivity with the aim of identifying those best suited for WSD. We also examine how the chosen lexicon and its connectivity influences WSD performance. We report results on standard data sets and show that our graph-based approach performs comparably to the state of the art.",M2
20223569,"Applied behavior analytic intervention for autism in early childhood: meta-analysis, meta-regression and dose-response meta-analysis of multiple outcomes.A number of clinical trials and single-subject studies have been published measuring the effectiveness of long-term, comprehensive applied behavior analytic (ABA) intervention for young children with autism. However, the overall appreciation of this literature through standardized measures has been hampered by the varying methods, designs, treatment features and quality standards of published studies. In an attempt to fill this gap in the literature, state-of-the-art meta-analytical methods were implemented, including quality assessment, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, dose-response meta-analysis and meta-analysis of studies of different metrics. Results suggested that long-term, comprehensive ABA intervention leads to (positive) medium to large effects in terms of intellectual functioning, <e>language</e> development, acquisition of daily living skills and social functioning in children with autism. Although favorable effects were apparent across all outcomes, language-related outcomes (IQ, receptive and expressive language, communication) were superior to non-verbal IQ, social functioning and daily living skills, with effect sizes approaching 1.5 for receptive and expressive language and communication skills. Dose-dependant effect sizes were apparent by levels of total treatment hours for language and adaptation composite scores. Methodological issues relating ABA clinical trials for autism are discussed.",M2
20220606,"Correlators of achievement in English for medical purposes among baccalaureate nursing students.BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals use English <e>language</e> medical terminology and phraseology to write medical records and to communicate within their profession. Patient medical records provide information and data critical to facilitating proper medical care. Therefore, it is essential for nurses to be able to apply and to understand medical English (known as  English for medical purposes  or EMP) correctly to provide optimal care for patients. PURPOSE: This study investigated the relationship between EMP achievement levels among baccalaureate nursing students and learning strategies, learning motivation, and individual variables such as student gender and general English proficiency. This study also identified important explanatory factors behind achieved EMP level for nursing students. METHODS: A cross-sectional correlational design was used. A sample of 103 nursing students (24 men and 79 women) in the second semester of their sophomore year completed Oxford's Strategy Inventory for Language Learning and the Foreign Language Learning Motivation Scale. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation, and multiple regression. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis showed learning motivation, gender, compensation strategy, and general English proficiency explained 32% of the variance in EMP achievement level. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study suggests that when designing an EMP curriculum for baccalaureate nursing students, course designers should consider (a) enhancing student learning motivation to improve the general level of EMP achievement, (b) increasing the use of EMP in professional nursing courses, and (c) introducing a variety of strategies aimed to help students master EMP.",M2
20220322,"Relationship satisfaction and emotional <e>language</e> in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer disease patients and spousal caregivers.We studied the impact of 2 types of dementia on marital satisfaction and on the emotional language that spouses use during conflictive marital interactions. Fifteen frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and 16 Alzheimer disease (AD) patient-caregiver couples, and 21 control couples, discussed a relationship problem in a laboratory setting. Marital satisfaction was assessed through questionnaire, and emotion language was quantified using text analysis. FTD couples reported lower marital satisfaction than AD and control couples. During the interactions, FTD and AD caregivers used significantly more negative emotion words than their patient spouses (no spousal differences were found in control couples). FTD caregivers also used more negative words than AD caregivers and controls. We interpret these findings as reflecting challenges that the behavioral changes in FTD create for maintaining a healthy marital bond.",M2
20220023,"Effects of lips and hands on auditory learning of second-<e>language</e> speech sounds.PURPOSE: Previous research has found that auditory training helps native English speakers to perceive phonemic vowel length contrasts in Japanese, but their performance did not reach native levels after training. Given that multimodal information, such as lip movement and hand gesture, influences many aspects of native language processing, the authors examined whether multimodal input helps to improve native English speakers' ability to perceive Japanese vowel length contrasts. METHOD: Sixty native English speakers participated in 1 of 4 types of training: (a) audio-only; (b) audio-mouth; (c) audio-hands; and (d) audio-mouth-hands. Before and after training, participants were given phoneme perception tests that measured their ability to identify short and long vowels in Japanese (e.g., /kato/ vs. /kato/). RESULTS: Although all 4 groups improved from pre- to posttest (replicating previous research), the participants in the audio-mouth condition improved more than those in the audio-only condition, whereas the 2 conditions involving hand gestures did not. CONCLUSIONS: Seeing lip movements during training significantly helps learners to perceive difficult second-language phonemic contrasts, but seeing hand gestures does not. The authors discuss possible benefits and limitations of using multimodal information in second-language phoneme learning.",M2
20218247,"<e>Language</e> issues in the community pharmacy: a perspective from Wales.OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to obtain the views of Welsh speakers to explore the role of the Welsh language in community pharmacies in bilingual communities in Wales. METHODS: Two communities with a high proportion of Welsh speakers were purposively identified for the research: one in North Wales and one in West Wales. Stage 1: semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of Welsh speakers to identify key themes. Data collection continued until no new themes emerged. Interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded manually and analysed thematically. Stage 2: self-complete questionnaire developed based on the interview results. The anonymous, bilingual questionnaire and covering letter, with a postage-paid envelope, were delivered to 500 homes (250 in each community) for completion by the person in the household who visited a pharmacy most often. There was no follow-up mailing due to anonymity. Data were analysed using SPSS version 12. KEY FINDINGS: Results from both interviews (n = 36) and questionnaires (response rate was 52%, 82% of whom were Welsh speakers) found that the majority of Welsh speakers in the study were able to understand English but preferred to use Welsh in the pharmacy. They would find it easier to explain symptoms and would ask more about their medication if they could speak Welsh with the pharmacist. In addition, the study participants would generally feel more at ease with a Welsh-speaking pharmacist and would feel they were getting a better service if they could use their first language. CONCLUSIONS: This study of Welsh speakers indicates that language choice is important for bilingual people who may prefer to use their native, minority language for consultation with health professionals. Further, it is clear that a concordant partnership between patient and pharmacist is less likely where one party is using a language with which they are not confident or comfortable. Pharmacists need to be aware of the linguistic needs and preferences of bilingual clients.",M2
20211545,"Clinical utility of functional magnetic resonance imaging for brain mapping in epilepsy surgery.Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is commonly used to localize brain function, but its utility in the clinical setting remains unclear. Subdural electrode implantation provides opportunities to correlate the spatial relationship of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to areas defined by extraoperative electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) in patients undergoing staged epilepsy surgery. 4 subjects underwent pre-operative fMRI using the analogous paradigms to those used for ESM to delineate <e>language</e> and motor function. Coregistration of the pre-operative MRI to a post-operative CT and MRI scan was performed in order to assess the spatial relationship between the BOLD response and the location of electrode contacts used for ESM while accounting for brain shift. fMRI was accurate in predicting the location of motor cortex with sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of 1.0. Specificity was .96 with a positive predictive (PPV) value of .8. In all 4 subjects, a laterality index of the fMRI for language was accurate in predicting lateralization measured by Wada testing. While T-scores over regions where ESM-induced language deficits occurred were significantly higher (p&lt;.05, Student's t-test) than those over regions where there was no ESM-induced deficit, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were poor over a range of threshold criteria. Sensitivity and specificity were improved by excluding sites within 1cm of the base of the frontal and temporal bone and sites where ESM showed motor function of face. Despite this, sensitivity and specificity were .47 and .76, respectively (T score 2.5, p&lt;.01 corrected FDR) with PPV and NPV of .40 and .77, respectively. Sensitivity for predicting areas within 1cm of ESM-defined language sites was higher at .82 with an NPV of .94. The results indicate that fMRI is clinically useful for lateralizing language and the localizing motor cortex. fMRI localizes language less accurately, but it may be useful in estimating the region of ESM-induced deficit in areas away from the base of the frontal and temporal bone.",M2
20209742,"Evaluation of a hepatitis B educational ESL curriculum for Chinese immigrants.OBJECTIVES: According to recent census data, 1,216,600 Canadians are of Chinese descent, and over 80% of Chinese Canadians are foreign born. Approximately 10% of Chinese immigrants are chronic carriers of hepatitis B, compared with less than 0.5% of the general population. English as a second <e>language</e> (ESL) classes provide ready access for individuals with limited English proficiency who are not reached by English language health education materials and media campaigns. We conducted a group-randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a hepatitis B ESL educational curriculum for Chinese immigrants. METHODS: Five community-based organizations that provide ESL education in the greater Vancouver area participated in the study. Forty-one ESL classes (which included 325 Chinese students) were randomly assigned to experimental or control status. A follow-up survey, conducted six months after randomization, assessed knowledge about hepatitis B. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Follow-up surveys were completed by 298 (92%) of the students. At follow-up, experimental group students were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) more likely than control group students to know that immigrants have higher hepatitis B infection rates than people who were born in Canada; hepatitis B can be spread during childbirth, during sexual intercourse and by sharing razors; hepatitis B is not spread by sharing eating utensils; and hepatitis B infection can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that ESL curricula can have a positive impact on health knowledge among Chinese immigrants with limited English. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of ESL curricula for other immigrant groups, as well as other health topics.",M2
20209735,"[STOPP-START: adaptation of a French <e>language</e> screening tool for detecting inappropriate prescriptions in older people.]OBJECTIVE: STOPP-START is a screening tool for detecting inappropriate prescriptions in older people. Recently validated in its English-language version, it is a reliable and easy-to-use tool, allowing assessment of prescription drugs often described as inappropriate (STOPP) or unnecessarily underused (START) in this population. An adaptation of the tool into French language is presented here. METHOD: A translation-back translation method, with validation of the obtained version by French-speaking experts from Belgium, Canada, France and Switzerland, has been used. An inter-rater reliability analysis completed the validation process. Fifty data sets of patients hospitalized in an academic geriatrics department (mean age +/- standard deviation: 77.6 +/- 7.9 years; 70% were women) were analyzed independently by one geriatrician and one general practitioner. RESULTS: The adaptation in French considers the 87 STOPP-START criteria of the original version. They are all organized according to physiological systems. The 50 data sets involved 418 prescribed medications (median 8; inter-quartile range 5-12). The proportions of positive and negative inter-observer agreements were 99% and 95% respectively for STOPP, and 99% and 88% for START; Cohen's kappa-coefficients were 0.95 for STOPP and 0.92 for START. These results indicated an excellent inter-rater agreement. CONCLUSION: Therefore, this French language version of STOPP-START is as reliable as the original English language version of the tool. For STOPP-START to have tangible clinical benefit to patients, a randomized controlled trial must be undertaken to demonstrate efficacy in the prevention of adverse clinical events connected with inappropriate prescriptions.",M2
20206985,"Is relational reasoning dependent on <e>language</e>? A voxel-based lesion symptom mapping study.Previous studies with brain-injured patients have suggested that language abilities are necessary for complex problem-solving, even when tasks are non-verbal. In the current study, we tested this notion by analyzing behavioral and neuroimaging data from a large group of left-hemisphere stroke patients (n=107) suffering from a range of language impairment from none to severe. Patients were tested on the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM), a non-verbal test of reasoning that requires participants to complete a visual pattern or sequence with one of six possible choices. For some items, the solution could be determined by visual pattern-matching, but other items required more complex, relational reasoning. As predicted, performance on the relational-reasoning items was disproportionately affected in language-impaired patients with aphasia, relative to non-aphasic, left-hemisphere patients. A voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) procedure was used to relate patients' RCPM performance with areas of damage in the brain. Results showed that deficits on the relational reasoning problems were associated with lesions in the left middle and superior temporal gyri, regions essential for language processing, as well as in the left inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, the visual pattern-matching condition was associated with lesions in posterior portions of the left hemisphere that subserve visual processing, namely, occipital and inferotemporal cortex. These findings provide compelling support for the idea that language is critical for higher-level reasoning and problem-solving.",M2
20205301,"How do bilinguals handle interhemispheric integration? Evidence from a cross-<e>language</e> study.The focus on interhemispheric interaction and integration has become a prominent aspect of laterality research. The aim of the present behavioral study was to determine whether hemisphere advantage differs between language groups. This was done by comparing how hemisphere advantage affects interhemispheric integration in monolingual and in bilingual individuals. Sixty university students (20 English monolinguals, 20 Hebrew bilinguals, and 20 balanced Arabic bilinguals) participated in two experiments, in which a lexical decision task was performed in the left and/or right visual field. Stimuli were presented unilaterally and bilaterally, whereby participants were cued to respond to the stimuli. In Experiment 1, all three groups showed an effect of lexicality, that is, participants responded to word stimuli faster than to non-word stimuli, with the Hebrew and Arabic groups showing a word advantage in spotting errors. In addition, all groups except the Hebrew group showed the expected right visual field advantage in accuracy, and the English group demonstrated this advantage in reaction time as well. In Experiment 2, responses to non-word stimuli were equally accurate in the left and right visual fields, but reaction time were faster for stimuli presented in the left visual field. The performance of balanced bilingual Arabic and unbalanced bilingual Hebrew reading groups was significantly better in the bilateral condition than in the unilateral condition. The results supported the notion that bilingual individuals show more effective interhemispheric communication and that they enjoy relative superiority in their interhemispheric processing in response to task demands.",M2

The data are derived from interviews with workers, employers, and older clients conducted in various home and long-term care services for older adults across three Canadian provinces: Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec. Factors stemming from immigrant care workers' ethnic/racial background, <e>language</e> barriers, and contextual factors such as staff shortage in different care settings for older adults complicate the relationship between immigrant care workers and their clients. In some cases, these factors diminish the quality of care. We point to some policy alternatives that our findings suggest should be considered.",M2

Neuroanatomical and functional relations]INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT: Impairments in <e>language</e> and communication are a defining feature of autism spectrum disorders. There is significant variability in linguistic abilities in autism spectrum disorders. They have difficulties with certain aspects of language such as semantics functions, syntax, prosody and phonology, although the most evident language deficits concern to pragmatics functioning. These language difficulties can cause serious problems in social interaction. CONCLUSIONS: The neural bases underlying this failure to develop language are unknown. Several functional and structural imaging studies have identified irregularities in language-related regions in autism spectrum disorders, such as morphometric differences in Broca's area and Wernicke's area, and patterns of reduced or reversed laterality in frontal and temporal cortex. There is also decreased functional connectivity between anterior and posterior language regions.",M2

DEVELOPMENT: Major contributions to the field are selected, presented, and discussed. Twin and family studies have demonstrated that most cognitive traits including language are moderately to highly heritable. Rare mutations affecting the FOXP2 transcription factor cause a monogenic speech and language disorder. The results of association studies of FOXP2 with several language disorders are controversial, probably due to the problem of phenotype definition. CONCLUSIONS: Common forms of disorders of speech and language are mostly likely associated with variability in the function of multiple genes. Longitudinal studies looking at gene environmental interaction might be important in order to understand the mechanism of language development.",M2
20204794,"Changes of evoked cerebral blood oxygenation and optical pathlength in the frontal lobe during <e>language</e> tasks: a study by multi-channel, time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy and functional MRI.To determine the alterations in optical characteristics and cerebral blood oxygenation (CBO) in the frontal lobe during language tasks, we evaluated the changes in mean optical pathlength (MOP) and CBO induced by a verbal fluency task (VFT) in the right and left frontal lobes in normal adults (n = 9, mean age = 29.6 +/- 4.8 years). We employed a newly developed 8-channel time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy (TRS) instrument. The results demonstrated differences in MOP in the fronto-temporal areas with subject and wavelength; however, there was no significant difference between the right and left sides (p &gt; 0.05). Also, the VFT did not affect the MOP significantly as compared to that before the tasks (p &gt; 0.05). In all of the recording regions, the VFT caused increases in concentration of oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin associated with a decrease in deoxyhemoglobin concentration, indicating that these cortical areas were activated by the VFT. However, the mean concentration changes of oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin on the left side were larger than those on the right side. In addition, functional MRI demonstrated that the inferior frontal gyrus on the left side was activated in the subjects who exhibited increases in oxyhemoglobin concentration in these areas. These results suggest that TRS may be useful to study language function and to assess hemispheric dominance for language.",M2
20204173,"A semantic model to study neural organization of <e>language</e> in bilingualism.A neural network model of object semantic representation is used to simulate learning of new words from a foreign language. The network consists of feature areas, devoted to description of object properties, and a lexical area, devoted to words representation. Neurons in the feature areas are implemented as Wilson-Cowan oscillators, to allow segmentation of different simultaneous objects via gamma-band synchronization. Excitatory synapses among neurons in the feature and lexical areas are learned, during a training phase, via a Hebbian rule. In this work, we first assume that some words in the first language (L1) and the corresponding object representations are initially learned during a preliminary training phase. Subsequently, second-language (L2) words are learned by simultaneously presenting the new word together with the L1 one. A competitive mechanism between the two words is also implemented by the use of inhibitory interneurons. Simulations show that, after a weak training, the L2 word allows retrieval of the object properties but requires engagement of the first language. Conversely, after a prolonged training, the L2 word becomes able to retrieve object per se. In this case, a conflict between words can occur, requiring a higher-level decision mechanism.",M2
