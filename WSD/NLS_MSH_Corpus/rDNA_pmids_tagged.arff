18631311,"Nested PCRs and sequencing of nuclear ITS-<e>rDNA</e> fragments detect three Leishmania species of gerbils in sandflies from Iranian foci of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.OBJECTIVE: To identify and understand the natural transmission cycles of Leishmania in Iranian sandflies. METHOD: Nested PCR protocols were developed to amplify two regions of the ribosomal RNA amplicon of Leishmania (ITS1-5.8S rRNA gene, and a microsatellite DNA region of ITS2), which were species-specific by DNA sequence or fragment size. RESULTS: The PCR assays detected in Iranian sandflies not only Leishmania major but also for the first time L. turanica and L. gerbilli sensu lato, two other parasites of the great gerbil. All three parasites were found in the northeast and centre of Iran, in two foci of rural Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused by L. major. Fifty infections were detected in common sandfly species: at least six geographically differentiated haplotypes of L. major in four to five sandfly species; one strain of L. gerbilli s.l. in five to six sandfly species and one strain of L. turanica in one sandfly species. CONCLUSION: Past conclusions about the transmission cycles of L. major in Iran should be treated with caution. Careful molecular eco-epidemiological investigations are essential for modelling the roles of different sandfly species in maintaining and spreading ZCL foci. Even if non-pathogenic to humans, frequent inoculations of L. turanica by sandflies might alter the efficacy of vaccines against L. major. Phlebotomus papatasi is probably the key vector in many ZCL foci because of its abundance and high infection rates with both L. major and L. turanica.",M1
17976983,"Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of acid-pretreated corncobs with a recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing beta-glucosidase.To reduce the cellobiose inhibition of exoglucanase and endogulcanase and enhance cellulose hydrolysis during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), a beta-glucosidase encoding gene named BGL1 was cloned from Saccharomycopsis fibuligera and integrated into the chromosomal <e>rDNA</e> region of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae industrial strain NAN-27 producing NAN-227. Compared with the parental strain, which had no detectable activity, the beta-glucosidase specific activity in NAN-227 was 1.02 IU/mg of protein. When cellobiose was used as the sole carbon source in a shake-flask, NAN-227 consumed 6.2g/L of cellobiose and produced 3.3g/L of ethanol in 48 h. The yield was 0.532 g/g. The parent strain only consumed 1.92 g/L of cellobiose and no ethanol was detected. During the SSF of acid-pretreated corncobs NAN-227 produced 20 g/L of ethanol at 72 h, which was similar to the parent strain when 20IU of beta-glucosidase/g of substrate was added.",M1
17854485,"DNA evidence for global dispersal and probable endemicity of protozoa.BACKGROUND: It is much debated whether microbes are easily dispersed globally or whether they, like many macro-organisms, have historical biogeographies. The ubiquitous dispersal hypothesis states that microbes are so numerous and so easily dispersed worldwide that all should be globally distributed and found wherever growing conditions suit them. This has been broadly upheld for protists (microbial eukaryotes) by most morphological and some molecular analyses. However, morphology and most previously used evolutionary markers evolve too slowly to test this important hypothesis adequately. RESULTS: Here we use a fast-evolving marker (ITS1 <e>rDNA</e>) to map global diversity and distribution of three different clades of cercomonad Protozoa (Eocercomonas and Paracercomonas: phylum Cercozoa) by sequencing multiple environmental gene libraries constructed from 47-80 globally-dispersed samples per group. Even with this enhanced resolution, identical ITS sequences (ITS-types) were retrieved from widely separated sites and on all continents for several genotypes, implying relatively rapid global dispersal. Some identical ITS-types were even recovered from both marine and non-marine samples, habitats that generally harbour significantly different protist communities. Conversely, other ITS-types had either patchy or restricted distributions. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest that geographic dispersal in macro-organisms and microbes is not fundamentally different: some taxa show restricted and/or patchy distributions while others are clearly cosmopolitan. These results are concordant with the 'moderate endemicity model' of microbial biogeography. Rare or continentally endemic microbes may be ecologically significant and potentially of conservational concern. We also demonstrate that strains with identical 18S but different ITS1 rDNA sequences can differ significantly in terms of morphological and important physiological characteristics, providing strong additional support for global protist biodiversity being significantly higher than previously thought.",M1
17005783,"PCR fingerprinting of Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. interdigitale using polymorphic subrepeat loci in the <e>rDNA</e> nontranscribed spacer.The sequence of the nontranscribed spacer (NTS) region of the rDNA of Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. interdigitale strain 2111 was determined, and three individual subrepeat loci identified. The first repeat region contained eight tandem copies of a degenerate 33-43 bp sequence, whilst the second had two complete and two partial 300 bp repeats. The third locus contained six tandemly repetitive elements of between 67 and 89 bp, which showed sequence identity to the TrS2 repeats of Trichophyton rubrum. PCR amplification of the individual repetitive regions from 42 random isolates of T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale identified fragment length polymorphisms at each locus. Sequence analysis of the PCR products revealed that the size variations resulted from differences in the copy number of each of the three sets of subrepeat elements, TmiS0, TmiS1 and TmiS2. In addition, some indels were present in the flanking regions of the TmiS1 repeats. Combining PCR fingerprints from each of the three polymorphic loci produced a total of 19 individual strain profiles. The method was rapid, reproducible and discriminatory, and the fragment patterns simple to interpret. PCR fingerprint analysis of variable tandem repeat loci in the T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale NTS represents a valuable molecular typing method for future epidemiological investigations in this species.",M1
16614998,"Identification of dominant bacteria in feces and colonic mucosa from healthy Spanish adults by culturing and by 16S <e>rDNA</e> sequence analysis.The aim of this work was to examine by culturing the changes in the total and indicator populations of the feces of two individuals over 1 year and to identify the dominant microbial components of a single sample of feces from each donor. Populations and dominant bacteria from a sample of colonic mucosa from a further individual were also assessed. The culture results were then compared to those obtained with the same samples by 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing. High interindividual variation in representative microbial populations of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was revealed by both the culture and the culture-independent techniques. Species belonging to Clostridium clusters (XIVa, IV, and XVIII) predominated in both the fecal and the mucosal samples (except in the mucose cultured isolates), members of Clostridium coccoides cluster XIVa being the most numerous microorganisms. Species of gamma-proteobacteria (Escherichia coli and Shigella spp.), bifidobacteria, and actinobacteria appeared in lower numbers than those of clostridia. From the mucosal cultured sample, only facultative anaerobes and bifidobacteria were recovered, suggesting destruction of the anaerobe population during processing. In accordance with this, the microbial diversity revealed by 16S rDNA sequence analysis was greater than that revealed by culturing. Despite large interindividual differences, distinct human communities may have group-associated GIT microbiota characteristics, such as the low number of Bacteroides seen in the subjects in this study.",M1
16522541,"Population diversity in model potable water biofilms receiving chlorine or chloramine residual.Most water utilities use chlorine or chloramine to produce potable water. These disinfecting agents react with water to produce residual oxidants within a water distribution system (WDS) to control bacterial growth. While monochloramine is considered more stable than chlorine, little is known about the effect it has on WDS biofilms. Community structure of 10-week old WDS biofilms exposed to disinfectants was assessed after developing model biofilms from unamended distribution water. Four biofilm types were developed on polycarbonate slides within annular reactors while receiving chlorine, chloramine, or inactivated disinfectant residual. Eubacteria were identified through 16S <e>rDNA</e> sequence analysis. The model WDS biofilm exposed to chloramine mainly contained Mycobacterium and Dechloromonas sequences, while a variety of alpha- and additional beta-proteobacteria dominated the 16S rDNA clone libraries in the other three biofilms. Additionally, bacterial clones distantly related to Legionella were found in one of the biofilms receiving water with inactivated chlorine residual. The biofilm reactor receiving chloraminated water required increasing amounts of disinfectant after 2 weeks to maintain chlorine residual. In contrast, free chlorine residual remained steady in the reactor that received chlorinated water. The differences in bacterial populations of potable water biofilms suggest that disinfecting agents can influence biofilm development. These results also suggest that biofilm communities in distribution systems are capable of changing in response to disinfection practices.",M1
16466607,"Cost-utility of somatropin (<e>rDNA</e> origin) in the treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to generate estimates of cost-effectiveness/utility of somatropin (rDNA origin) in the treatment of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in children. METHODS: A decision-analytic model of the epidemiology and treatment of GHD in children was developed. Treatment of GHD was assessed in two hypothetical cohorts compared to no treatment--treatment with somatropin 0.030 mg/kg/day from ages 5 to 16 years, and treatment from ages 3 to 18 years. Costs (stated in 2005 US$) included those related to drug acquisition, endocrinologist consultations, and primary care office visits. Estimates of patient weight by age and sex were derived from published literature, as was the proportion of patients achieving normal height through somatropin treatment and pre/post-treatment patient utilities. Cost-effectiveness/utility was estimated over patients' expected lifetimes, and was stated alternatively as discounted (3% per annum) US dollars per normal height year (NHY) gained, and cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure robustness of the model. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of treating children from ages 5 to 16 years with somatropin was estimated at approximately $8,900 per NHY gained and $37,000 per QALY gained, respectively. Corresponding ratios pertaining to treatment of children from ages 3 to 18 years were $9,300 per NHY gained and $42,600 per QALY gained. Findings were relatively insensitive to variation in most model parameters. CONCLUSIONS: For both age cohorts, the cost-effectiveness/utility of somatropin in the treatment of GHD compares favorably to well-accepted threshold values. The use of somatropin represents reasonable value for money for the treatment of GHD in children.",M1
16286090,"Phylogenetic relationships and biodiversity in Hylids (Anura: Hylidae) from French Guiana.We evaluated two biodiversity criteria, higher taxonomic diversity and phylogenetic diversity in French Guiana. For this, we used a recent assessment of the knowledge accumulated since 30 years of study on the amphibian species currently known in French Guiana. We focused on two well-represented genera, Hyla and Scinax, belonging to the subfamily Hylinae. We used partial sequences of two mitochondrial genes (16S <e>rDNA</e> and 12S rDNA, 813 bp) and two nuclear genes (tyrosinase and 18S rRNA, 1590 bp) covering a total of 2403 bp. According to the high bootstrap support in phylogenetic analysis of the complete dataset, the genus Scinax is a homophyletic clade formed by two species groups (rubra and rostrata) in French Guiana. The genus Hyla was confirmed to be a paraphyletic group formed by two species groups as well (30 chromosomes and the 'gladiator frogs'). We confirmed that these genera should be taxonomically reconsidered. Moreover, at the genus, subfamily and family levels, the use of only morphological characters or only molecular DNA markers would hamper estimations of biodiversity. Thus, we strongly advise the combined use of both morphology and molecular data (nuclear and mitochondrial markers).",M1
16028966,"Quantitation of transgenic plant DNA in leachate water: real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis.Roundup Ready (RR) genetically modified (GM) corn and soybean comprise a large portion of the annual planted acreage of GM crops. Plant growth and subsequent plant decomposition introduce the recombinant DNA (<e>rDNA</e>) into the soil environment, where its fate has not been completely researched. Little is known of the temporal and spatial distribution of plant-derived rDNA in the soil environment and in situ transport of plant DNA by leachate water has not been studied before. The objectives of this study were to determine whether sufficient quantities of plant rDNA were released by roots during growth and early decomposition to be detected in water collected after percolating through a soil profile and to determine the influence of temperature on DNA persistence in the leachate water. Individual plants of RR corn and RR soybean were grown in modified cylinders in a growth room, and the cylinders were flushed with rain water weekly. Immediately after collection, the leachate was subjected to DNA purification followed by rDNA quantification using real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis. To test the effects of temperature on plant DNA persistence in leachate water, water samples were spiked with known quantities of RR soybean or RR corn genomic DNA and DNA persistence was examined at 5, 15, and 25 degrees C. Differences in the amounts and temporal distributions of root-derived rDNA were observed between corn and soybean plants. The results suggest that rainfall events may distribute plant DNA throughout the soil and into leachate water. Half-lives of plant DNA in leachate water ranged from 1.2 to 26.7 h, and persistence was greater at colder temperatures (5 and 15 degrees C).",M1
15964832,"Global loss of Set1-mediated H3 Lys4 trimethylation is associated with silencing defects in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Post-translational histone modifications, such as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation, have been correlated with regulation of gene expression. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Set1 has been identified as the sole histone methyltransferase required for histone H3 lysine 4 (Lys(4)) methylation. Yeast cells that do not express Set1 have several apparent phenotypes, including slow growth and defects in telomere, HML, and <e>rDNA</e> silencing. However, the mechanism by which the Set1 methyltransferase mediates differential histone H3 methylation (mono-, di-, and tri-) is still not understood, and the involvement of domains or regions in Set1 contributing to H3 Lys(4) methylation has not been well characterized. In this study, the N terminus of Set1 was shown to be important for global and gene specific histone H3 trimethylation. We show that Set1 trimethyl-defective mutants can rescue a set1Delta slow growth defect. In contrast, Set1 trimethyl mutants were defective in telomere, rDNA, HML, and HMR silencing. Taken together, these data suggest that histone H3 Lys(4) trimethylation is required for proper silencing, while mono- and/or dimethylation is sufficient for cell growth.",M1

15606700,"A rational clinical approach to suspected insulin allergy: status after five years and 22 cases.AIMS: Allergy to recombinant human (<e>rDNA</e>) insulin preparations is a rare complication of insulin therapy. However, insulin preparations contain several allergens, and several disorders can resemble insulin allergy. Studies evaluating the diagnostic procedures on suspected insulin allergy are extremely few. METHODS: Since January 1998, we have used a standardized investigative procedure during admittance to the medical ward allowing observation and repeated recording of reactions to intradermal skin test (performed with a commercially available kit containing isolated insulin allergens). Data on all investigated cases until April 2003 were collected retrospectively, and self-reported efficacy of intervention was compared to clinical data. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included. In nine (41%) cases, non-insulin allergic causes were discovered and successfully treated: poor injection technique (n = 5), skin disease (n = 3) and other systemic allergy (n = 1). Nine other patients were found to be allergic to protamine (n = 3) or rDNA insulin (n = 6), and specific treatment was associated with relief in 8 patients (89%). Four patients had local reactions of unknown causes but symptom relief was obtained in three cases by unspecific therapy. Overall, 20 (91%) reported relief of symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our standardized investigative procedure of suspected insulin preparation (IP) allergy was associated with relief of symptoms in &gt; 90% of patients. IP allergy was diagnosed in 41%, and intradermal testing with isolated insulin allergens was a prerequisite in identification of culprit allergen and targeting of treatment.",M1
15137918,"Relative stability of transgene DNA fragments from GM rapeseed in mixed ruminal cultures.The use of transgenic crops as feeds for ruminant animals has prompted study of the possible uptake of transgene fragments by ruminal micro-organisms and/or intestinal absorption of fragments surviving passage through the rumen. The persistence in buffered ruminal contents of seven different recombinant DNA fragments from GM rapeseed expressing the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) transgene was tracked using PCR. Parental and transgenic (i.e. glyphosphate-tolerant; Roundup Ready, Monsanto Company, St Louis, MO, USA) rapeseed were incubated for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h as whole seeds, cracked seeds, rapeseed meal, and as pelleted, barley-based diets containing 65 g rapeseed meal/kg. The seven transgene fragments ranged from 179 to 527 bp and spanned the entire 1363 bp EPSPS transgene. A 180 bp ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) small subunit fragment and a 466 bp 16S <e>rDNA</e> fragment were used as controls for endogenous rapeseed DNA and bacterial DNA respectively. The limit of detection of the PCR assay, established using negative controls spiked with known quantities of DNA, was 12.5 pg. Production of gas and NH3 was monitored throughout the incubation and confirmed active in vitro fermentation. Bacterial DNA was detected in all sample types at all time points. Persistence patterns of endogenous (Rubisco) and recombinant (EPSPS) rapeseed DNA were inversely related to substrate digestibility (amplifiable for 48, 8 and 4 h in whole or cracked seeds, meal and diets respectively), but did not differ between parental and GM rapeseed, nor among fragments. Detection of fragments was representative of persistence of the whole transgene. No EPSPS fragments were amplifiable in microbial DNA, suggesting that transformation had not occurred during the 48 h incubation. Uptake of transgenic DNA fragments by ruminal bacteria is probably precluded or time-limited by rapid degradation of plant DNA upon plant cell lysis.",M1
12450123,"Characterization of subrepeat regions within <e>rDNA</e> intergenic spacers of the edible basidiomycete Lentinula edodes.For 16 commercial cultivars of Lentinula edodes, DNA fragments for the nuclear rDNA intergenic spacers IGS1 and IGS2 were amplified and analyzed. IGS1 contained a subrepeat region, named SR1, and IGS2 contained a pair of direct repeats and a subrepeat region, named SR2. Three and five types of subrepeats were found in SR1 and SR2, respectively. Heterogeneity in the lengths of IGS1 and IGS2 arose mainly from the number of different kinds of subrepeats within SR1 and SR2. The DNA fingerprints from the PCR products targeting SR1 and SR2 were specific for each of the 16 cultivars, and had enough variation for discrimination among the cultivars. This result suggests that the DNA fingerprints targeting SR1 and SR2 are useful for investigations of L. edodes cultivars.",M1
12408147,"Ethical debates in genetic engineering: U.S. scientists' attitudes on patenting, germ-line research, food labeling, and agri-biotech issues.A 1995 survey of 1,257 scientists working in the field of recombinant DNA research indicates wide areas of agreement as well as some noteworthy divisions when it comes to such thorny questions as patenting, germ-line research, food labeling, and biodiversity. In general, the scientists surveyed approve of patenting living organisms that result from <e>rDNA</e> research, but vary significantly on what should be patentable. They advocate human germ-line therapy, yet have reservations about using it for any but serious diseases. They oppose mandatory labeling of biologically engineered food products, but understand that the public has a right to know and advocate openness. Finally, they favor development of threats to biodiversity and maintain that publicly funded researchers should be legally obligated to consider the potential environmental effects of their research. Some clear differences arise between scientists working in industry and those in academia and between men and women.",M1

10636046,"Micro flow bio-molecular computation.In this paper we provide a model for micro-flow based bio-molecular computation (MF-BMC). It provides an abstraction for the design of algorithms which account for the constraints of the model. Our MF-BMC model uses abstractions of both the recombinant DNA (<e>RDNA</e>) technology as well as of the micro-flow technology and takes into account both of their limitations. For example, when considering the efficiency of the recombinant DNA operation of annealing, we take into account the limitation imposed by the concentration of the reactants. The fabrication technology used to construct MEMS is limited to constructing relatively thin 3D structures. We abstract this by limiting the model to a small constant number of layers (as is done with VLSI models). Besides our contribution of the MF-BMC model, the paper contains two other classes of results. The main result is the volume and time efficient algorithm for message routing in the MF-BMC model, specifically useful for PA-Match. We will show that routing of strands between chambers will occur in time O(N x D/ m x n), where N is the number of strands in the MF-BMC, n is the number of chambers where RDNA operations are occurring, D is the diameter of the topology of the layout of the chambers, and m is proportional to the channel width. Operations that need annealing, such as PA-Match, are shown feasible in O(N2logN/n/n) volume instead of the previous use of omega(N2) volume, with reasonable time constraints. Applications of the volume efficient algorithm include the use of the Join operation for databases, logarithmic depth solutions to SAT (Boolean formula satisfiability) problems and parallel algorithms that execute on a PRAM. Existent algorithms can be mapped to ones that work efficiently in the MF-BMC model, whereas previous methods for applications such as PRAM simulation in BMC were not both time and volume efficient. Our other class of results are theoretical lower bounds on the quantities of DNA and the time needed to solve a problem in the MF-BMC model, analogous to lower bounds in VLSI. We bound the product BT from below, and further show that BT2 has a stronger lower bound of I2. Here B is the maximum amount of information encoded in the MF-BMC system at a time. T is the time for an algorithm to complete, and I is the information content of a problem.",M1
9368538,"Diagnosis of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by micro-immunofluorescence and ELISA.The incidence of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection was determined in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) by prospective serial serology. Chlamydia-specific IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies were detected with a recombinant DNA lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ELISA as well as with a micro-immunofluorescence (MIF) assay with C. pneumoniae elementary bodies. From 271 consecutive COPD patients who visited the outpatient clinic of the department of pulmonary diseases (211 males, 60 females, age range 34-88 years, mean age 66 SD 10 years), blood samples (n = 1058) were taken every 2-7 months; the observation period ranged from 3 to 19 months (mean 15 SD 4). The prevalence of chlamydial IgG was 72% with the MIF and 53% with the <e>rDNA</e> LPS ELISA. More than 90% of the COPD patients had no significant changes in their chlamydia-specific IgG, IgA and IgM titres in either test during the observation period. Seven (3%) patients had MIF results indicating acute C. pneumoniae infection during their surveillance period, of whom five were confirmed by rDNA LPS ELISA. Eleven (4%) additional patients were infected during observation, as determined by rDNA LPS ELISA only. These patients had significantly elevated C. pneumoniae-specific IgG and IgA MIF titres, as compared with the patients without infection. All 18 patients with serological evidence of acute infection during their surveillance period were re-tested in a commercial MIF test that can distinguish between C. pneumoniae, C. trachomatis and C. psittaci LPS-specific antibodies, but no evidence of C. trachomatis or C. psittaci infection was found. The incidence of chlamydial infection was 2.2 and 5.3/100 person-years, when diagnosed by MIF and rDNA LPS ELISA, respectively. It is concluded that the rDNA LPS chlamydia assay may currently be the most sensitive serological tool for diagnosing recent respiratory chlamydia infections and that C. pneumoniae infection occurs frequently in COPD patients.",M1
9035961,"The use of combined FISH/GISH in conjunction with DAPI counterstaining to identify chromosomes containing transgene inserts in amphidiploid tobacco.We have used combined fluorescent and genomic in situ hybridization (FISH/GISH) together with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) counterstaining to determine simultaneously the chromosomal integration site and subgenomic allocation of a transgene insert in amphidiploid tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, 2n = 4 chi = 48). The procedure provides sufficient information on physical markers to identify at least 20 out of 24 chromosome pairs of two tobacco cultivars commonly used in studies on transgene expression and silencing (cv. Petit Havana SR1 and cv. Gatersleben). The chromosomes can be distinguished on the basis of diploid parental ancestry, size, morphology, the presence of <e>rDNA</e> loci and/or intergenomic exchanges, and the DAPI banding pattern, which is shown here for the first time for N. tabacum. From a single ISH experiment, it should now be possible in most cases to identify a tobacco chromosome carrying a transgene insert, thus permitting systematic studies of how the chromosomal location of transgenes influences expression levels.",M1
8929389,"Stimulation of mitotic recombination upon transcription from the yeast GAL1 promoter but not from other RNA polymerase I, II and III promoters.Homologous recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other organisms can be stimulated by transcription. Consistent with this, we find that recombination of a chromosomal ade1 allele with a plasmid-borne ADE1 ORF under the control of the GAL1 promoter increased from 6.1x10(-6) to 1.7x10(-4) when transcription of the plasmid locus was induced by growing the cells in the presence of galactose. Recombination could also be stimulated by over-expressing the Gal4 transcription factor in the presence of the GAL1-ADE1 plasmid, while culturing the cells in dextrose medium. However, when transcription of the same ORF was driven from the highly active promoters of the <e>rDNA</e> (RNA polymerase I), and ADH1 (RNA polymerase II) genes, only background levels of recombination (5-10x10(-6)) were observed, irrespective of the carbon source. Recombination was found to involve integration of the whole plasmid and to depend on RAD51, RAD52 and RAD54. The results indicate that increased accessibility of transcriptionally active chromatin is not sufficient to cause increased rates of this kind of reciprocal exchange.",M1

The ISI was compared with two other lyophilized preparations of human recombinant inhibin, the International Standard for Porcine inhibin (ISP) and preparations of human follicular fluid inhibin. Predicted loss of activity based on estimates of potency of contents of ampoules which had been stored under conditions of accelerated thermal degradation indicated that the ISI has satisfactory stability. On the basis of the results of this study, the ISI was deemed suitable to serve as a standard for in vitro bioassays and immunoassays and was established by the Expert Committee on Biological Standardization of the World Health Organization as the First International Standard for inhibin, recombinant human, with an assigned unitage of 150,000 International Units per ampoule.

9034974,"And the next 50 years? The future of recombinant DNA technology in oral medicine.As we celebrate this spectacular 50th anniversary, fluoridation continues to be the most effective public health strategy to reduce the disease burden of dental caries. Curiously, while H. Trendley Dean and his colleagues at the National Institutes of Health were investigating the effects of fluoride on tooth enamel in the mid-1930s, two young boys, one in London and the other in Chicago, were growing up to become the catalysts for another  biological revolution.  These two very talented individuals, James Watson and Francis Crick, would later meet by accident at Cambridge and produce their seminal discovery published in April 1953 as a letter in Nature, a one-page article provoking an international scientific adventure to understand living organisms in terms of the structure and function of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a universal genetic code and a rationale for the applications of recombinant DNA technology (<e>rDNA</e>) in fields as diverse as agriculture, energy, industry, and health. As we now reflect upon the triumphs from fluoridation and ponder the next 50 years and the complexities of craniofacial, oral, and dental diseases, it becomes increasingly evident that recombinant DNA technology coupled with health promotion, disease prevention, and public education offers the promise for remarkable advances in prevention, diagnosis, and therapeutics in oral medicine.",M1

8638284,"Safety evaluation of biological and biotechnology-derived medicines.Evaluating the 'safety' of drugs produced by biotechnology resembles the assessment of conventional 'new chemical entities,' but with certain major differences. The 'quality' of the product requires careful control because of concern about the carry-over of DNA, immunogenic proteins, endotoxin and process chemicals. Equally the potency and purity of the product must also be considered, as well as its identity. The toxicity testing of <e>rDNA</e>-derived proteins, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, although increasingly being swept under the umbrella of conventional studies, should be empirically devised according to the nature and physiological effects of the substance, taking account of the responsiveness of suitable species for non-clinical testing, the potential immunogenicity of heterologous proteins and any effect the drug may have on physiological mechanisms and the immune status of the test animals. Conventional types of single and multidose and reproduction toxicity experiments can then be adapted to detect and investigate any hazard of the novel drug.

8010685,"Two-step cell disruption for the extraction of membrane-associated recombinant protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.The use of <e>rDNA</e> technology to express heterologous proteins has been very successful during the last several years. Choice of an expression host is very important in order to retain the biological activity of recombinant proteins. Baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a eucaryotic GRAS organism suitable for the expression of biologically active proteins. Specifically, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is expressed in baker's yeast. Because the yeast cells need to be disrupted for the recovery of bioactive intracellular proteins and because the protein HBsAg is hydrophobic and has a tendency to become associated with cell membranes, the use of detergent increases the recovery yield. In order to remove most of the contaminants from yeast, a two-step disruption/extraction scheme has been developed that facilitates downstream processing. Furthermore, it also has the advantage of minimizing proteolytic actions on the recombinant protein by removing most of the contaminants and proteases into the supernatant during the first disruption step, while keeping the desired protein in the pellet fraction. Final recovery is then achieved by the extraction process. Parameters affecting the disruption/extraction processes have been discussed.",M1

A total of 204 Merino sheep were allocated to one of 12 groups, and vaccinated with preparations containing a variable number of rDNA D. nodosus fimbrial antigens. The most complex vaccine contained ten fimbrial antigens from all major D. nodosus serogroups, while the least complex contained a single fimbrial antigen. In addition to D. nodosus fimbrial antigens, other bacterial rDNA fimbrial antigens (Moraxella bovis Da12d and Escherichia coli K99), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were used in some vaccines. Antibody titres to fimbrial antigens and BSA were measured by agglutination and ELISA tests, respectively. Antibody titres were determined on five occasions (Weeks 0, 3, 6, 8, and 11 after primary vaccination). All sheep were exposed to an experimental challenge with virulent isolates of D. nodosus from either serogroup A or B, 8 weeks after primary vaccination. For D. nodosus K-agglutinating antibody titres, a strong negative correlation between antibody titre and footrot lesion score was observed. This relationship was influenced by the virulence of the challenge strain. Increasing the number of fimbrial antigens in experimental rDNA D. nodosus fimbrial vaccines resulted in a linear decrease in K-agglutinating antibody titres to individual D. nodosus serogroups. Similarly, a linear decrease in protection to challenge with homologous serogroups was observed as the number of D. nodosus fimbrial antigens represented in the vaccine increased. The reduction in antibody titres in multicomponent vaccines is thought to be due to antigenic competition. The level of competition between individual antigens is not constant and appears to be related to the immunodominance (nature) of the competing antigens. Both BSA ELISA, and M. bovis K-agglutinating antibody titres were adversely affected by the presence of two D. nodosus fimbrial preparations, whereas the antigenicity of E. coli K99 was unchanged by the presence of two additional D. nodosus antigens. Further studies are required to determine the step(s) in the immune response which are influenced by antigenic competition. Our results suggest that antigen presentation, particularly following primary vaccination, is the step most strongly influenced by antigenic competition.",M1

YACs susceptible to deletion during outgrowth of wild-type cells (or in preliminary experiments, in RAD6 transformants) were stable for up to 100 generations or more in the other strains. Thus both the RAD1 and RAD51/RAD52 epistatic pathways are apparently involved in the instability of YACs containing tandem repeat loci, presumably during recombination-based deletion formation; and a yeast host disarmed in these pathways will likely maintain YACs intact that are otherwise unstable.",M1
7883104,"Genetic stability of <e>rDNA</e> production systems, a case report.Producing rDNA proteins to be used as human therapeutic agents requires a biological production system during both storage and growth.

All master cell banks prepared for the production of medicinal products are fully characterized at the genetic and biochemical level. Whether these characteristics can be consistently maintained, particularly when the cells are propagated through a high number of generations and the culture grown into tens of thousands of litres, will have significant effects on the quality of the final products. Considerable experience and data regarding the stability of biological production systems involving plasmid and E. coli or yeast have been accumulated during the past 10 years. These data, including size and restriction analyses of the plasmid and sequence determination of relevant portions of the plasmid DNA isolated from cells collected before culture harvest, demonstrated that plasmid alteration at the structural level do occur, and some with high frequency or concentration.

While there is a need to improve and validate the ability of end-product testing procedures to detect low levels of variant proteins, there are several reasons why it may not be justified to require extensive DNA sequence analysis of large numbers of individual clones of producer cells. These include difficulties in interpreting the resultant data due to artefacts introduced by PCR and the fact that other events, such as translational errors and chemical and enzymic alterations during production and downstream processing, also lead to potential heterogeneity of pharmaceutical proteins. The evaluation of these products can only be made at the protein level. Some DNA sequencing will be required during product development, but in practice the quality and consistency of rDNA-derived products are best determined by a range of in-process and end-product testing procedures, including the use of biological assays and standardization.",M1

We have previously shown that most insect species contain insertions in their 28S genes at the R1 and/or R2 site. We have sequenced the 3' half of R1 and R2 elements from three additional insect species: the fungus gnat, Sciara coprophila (Diptera); the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica (Colleoptera); and the parasitic wasp, Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera). The elements were obtained by screening lambda phage genomic clones containing <e>rDNA</e> units and by a polymerase chain reaction approach using degenerate primers to conserved sequences in the reverse-transcriptase domain, in combination with a second primer to the 28S gene 3' of the insertion site. Comparisons of the sequences of R1 and R2 from four insect orders suggest that the organization of their open-reading frames has been conserved and is therefore likely to be similar throughout insects. This sequence analysis also indicates that, except for 5' truncations generated during the retrotransposition process itself, most elements have not accumulated mutations that would make them inactive. Popillia japonica and N. vitripennis differed from previously described species, in that (a) P. japonica contained multiple families of R2 and (b) N. vitripennis contained multiple families of R1. Nucleotide sequence identity between these different families is low. Amino acid sequence identity of their open-reading frames averaged only 41% for the R2 families of P. japonica and 35% for the R1 families of N. vitripennis. The presence of multiple highly divergent families of elements within a species suggests either that each insertion family is able to maintain its copy number without eliminating the other families in its competition for a limited number of 28S genes or that there has been extensive horizontal transfer of R1 and R2 elements between insect species.",M1

B. Evans, W. G. Tarpley, and S. K. Sharma, 1991, Protein Expression Purif. 2, 205-213) the cloning, expression, and characterization of recombinant chimeric proteins with an N-terminal metal-binding peptide (mbp), His-Asp-His-Asp-His, and a renin cleavage site. Using these chimerics as examples, we describe here the use of genetically engineered alternating histidines in the purification of these chimerics by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). In these chimerics, an alternate histidine-containing peptide was fused to the N-termini of HIV reverse transcriptase (HIV RT) and beta-galactosidase. These chimerics were retarded on immobilized nickel very strongly and could be completely eluted only by the use of 100 mM imidazole, whereas the wildtype HIV RT and Escherichia coli contaminating proteins were eluted between 10 and 35 mM imidazole. When the DNA coding for the mbp was removed, the resulting chimerics were recovered from the IMAC column at 35 mM imidazole. The strong and specific interaction between the chimeric protein and the immobilized metal ion was also abolished when the mbp was specifically cleaved by human renin. It is concluded from these studies that tailoring recombinant proteins with three or more alternate histidines should result in the isolation of such chimeric proteins from crude mixtures in a single step. Since IMAC is amendable to scale up, the tailored specificity engineered into the protein of interest via an mbp should allow one to achieve large-scale isolation of recombinant proteins from bacterial and nonbacterial hosts in a highly predictable manner.",M1

All cytokines were ampouled in microgram quantities with relatively large quantities (milligrams) of bulking agent such as albumin and carbohydrate which were shown to have no effect on the biological activity of the cytokine. Residual moisture present in the preparations and their uptake was measured by Karl-Fischer titration and found to vary from 0.5% to 4% moisture. On storage over phosphorus pentoxide these values were reduced to 0.1% to 0.5% with good reproducibility throughout the batch. Reconstitution of the freeze-dried plug was readily achieved in seconds.

Demonstration using monoclonal antibodies raised against <e>rDNA</e> human proinsulin.Hybridomas producing proinsulin antibodies were cloned by limiting dilution of cell cultures obtained by fusion of splenocytes of immunized mice with immortal myeloma cells. Some proinsulin monoclonal antibodies crossreacted with labelled insulin but none did with labelled C-peptide indicating that the involved epitopes were at one of the insulin/C-peptide junctions or included in the insulin moiety. Hybridoma supernatants were assayed for IgG concentration by a solid phase assay and for ligand binding by a radiobinding assay and an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The half-life of immune complexes formed with radioligand was measured and, as expected, correlated with affinity as measured by the method of Scatchard. Antibody titres determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay did not correlate to those measured by radiobinding assay. IgG concentration correlated to enzyme linked immunosorbent assay titres but not to radiobinding assay titres. Finally, a significant correlation was found between radiobinding assay titre and the product of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay titre by the period of immune complexes. It is concluded that, except for very low affinity antibodies, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay is a capacity assay whereas radiobinding assay is influenced by both antibody concentration and affinity. The former assay is thus best suited to detecting low affinity antibodies whereas the latter is more efficient in the presence of low levels of high affinity antibodies.",M1

The separation of rhGH and deamidated variants were examined over the range of low pH (less than 2.5) to high pH (8.0) on a coated silica capillary. No resolution was observed at pH 2.5 while at pH values of 6.5 or greater the deamidated species were separated. At pH 3.5 the variant was partially resolved but no detector signal was observed at pH 4.5 and 5.0. HPCE was also used to monitor a glycoprotein (rt-PA) with charge heterogeneity presumably due to variable sialic acid content. At a pH value of 4.5, the charge heterogeneity was only observed as peak broadening.

The magnitude of the cytolytic responses was dependent on the IL 2 dose (greater than or equal to 0.1 microgram per injection) and the time period of treatment (the maximum response was on days 3 to 4 after daily treatment). In vivo application of antisera against the murine NK marker asialo GM1 (asGM1) and against interferon-alpha/beta and -gamma (IFN) significantly inhibited NK cell activation. Limiting dilution analysis revealed high frequencies (up to 1 in 1.8 X 10(3)) of in vitro IL 2 reactive mononuclear cells among the peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) of normal mice. rDNA-IL 2 activated non-adherent PEC to proliferate. The majority of these cultures also displayed cytotoxicity against YAC targets. No exogenous IFN was required for either response. Endogenous IFN production did not appear to play an important role for induction of cytotoxicity in this system either. Only a minority of cultures produced measurable levels of IFN without showing excessive cytotoxic activity. In vivo IL 2 treatment resulted in a rapid increase of the total numbers and frequencies of the IL 2 reactive PEC. Hence, IL 2 alone was apparently sufficient for in vitro activation of NK-like activities, whereas IFN-induction by IL 2 was required for in vivo elicitation of similar responses in perhaps the same cell populations.",M1

After randomization, 7 patients received IFN alpha 2 two million IU m-2 day-1, s.c., 3 times a week (schedule 1) and 7 patients received 50 million IU m-2 day-1, i.v., for 5 consecutive days, every 3 weeks (schedule 2). Treatment duration was 4-21 weeks in schedule 1 and 6-24 weeks (2-8 courses) in schedule 2. Regressions were not achieved with either schedule. Treatment was associated with significant toxicity and was more severe in schedule 2. Dose limiting toxicities were leukopenia, elevation of liver enzymes, hyperglycemia and fatigue. Serum IFN activity was low or undetectable in patients on schedule 1 and high in patients on schedule 2. At 24 h, serum IFN activity was detectable in only 1/6 patients on schedule 1 as compared to 3/7 patients on schedule 2. IFN neutralizing factors were detected in the serum of only 1 patient prior to treatment but none were detected in any of the patients during or after discontinuation of treatment (4-24 weeks). IFN alpha 2 increased the expression of both HLA class 1 antigens and beta 2 microglobulin in peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo. This effect was dose related.",M1

We also demonstrated IgE and total antibody binding to bovine insulin with the use of radioimmunoassays. Both patients had cutaneous reactivity to all three insulins. When the serum of one patient was preincubated with human, porcine, or bovine insulin, there was inhibition of binding of the patient's IgE and IgG antibodies to human insulin. The other patient had very low levels of IgE antibodies to insulin and thus only IgG inhibition was possible. Preincubation with human insulin inhibited binding of each patient's antibodies to bovine or porcine insulin. We conclude that, for these two patients, human insulin has all the antigenic determinants that bovine and porcine insulin have. Therefore, human insulin for these two patients will not eliminate insulin allergy in all patients with systemic allergy to animal insulin, because there are patients whose antibodies recognize determinants common to commercial human, bovine, and porcine insulin.",M1

2408964,"Alterations in the number of rRNA operons within the Bacillus subtilis genome.Deletions and additions of rRNA gene sets in Bacillus subtilis were observed by Southern hybridizations using cloned radiolabeled <e>rDNA</e> sequences. Of the ten rRNA gene sets found in B. subtilis 168M or NCTC3610, one was deleted in strains possessing the leuB1, ilvC1, argA2 and pheA1 mutations. Among EcoRI restriction fragments of genomic DNA products, a 2.9-kb 23S rRNA homolog was missing. In HindIII digest, both 5.5- and 5.1-kb hybrid bands were lost with 16S and 23S probes, respectively. Similarly, genomic DNAs digested with SmaI showed the absence of both 2.1- and 2.0-kb fragments that hybridized to 16S and 5S sequences, respectively, in wild-type genomes. In contrast, B. subtilis strain 166 and its derivatives displayed a gain of a 3.3-kb HindIII fragment homologous to 16S rRNA. Transforming the ilvC1 and leuB1 mutations into new genetic backgrounds revealed in some clones the concomitant introduction of the ribosomal defect. Transformations with the slightly heterologous donor DNA from strain W23 yielded some Leu+ and Arg+ transformants with altered hybridization patterns when probed with cloned sequences. We propose that the deletion of the rRNA operon occurred in the ilv-leu gene cluster of the B. subtilis genome as a result of unequal recombination between redundant sequences.",M1

The recombinant clones were tested by colony hybridization. The presence of the 5S rDNA structural sequences in cloned fragments was determined by the Southern procedure of hybridization with 5S [32P]rRNA of the loach and transcription in the oocyte test system. It was found that the size of 5S rDNA repetitive units corresponds to 240-250 bp and 450-460 bp.

6376287,"Stability of recombinant plasmids containing the ars sequence of yeast extrachromosomal <e>rDNA</e> in several strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.The mitotic stabilities of hybrid plasmid Rcp21/11, which contains the replicator of yeast rDNA, have been compared for four yeast host strains of different origins. In two related strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A62-1G-P188 and 1A-P3812 from the Peterhof genetic stocks, the plasmid was much more stable than in strains DC5 and GRF18 from the USA stocks. The enhanced mitotic stability of Rcp21/11 in these two yeast strains is obviously attributable to a higher rate of integration of the plasmid into the chromosomal rDNA repeats of the hosts. The centromeric locus CEN3 was inserted into Rcp21/11 because it provides high mitotic and meiotic stability of plasmids with yeast replicators, due to an ordered distribution of plasmids throughout cell division. Using the new centromeric plasmid RcpCEN3, transformation of the four above-described yeast strains was carried out. It was found that, similarly to centromeric plasmids with other chromosomal replicators, RcpCEN3 remains in the cell as a single copy. In strains DC5, GRF18 and A62-1G-P188 the mitotic stability of RcpCEN3 was 20-50%, i.e., less than half that of plasmids containing locus CEN3 and other yeast replicators, ars1, ars2 and the 2mu DNA replicator. The mitotic stability of RcpCEN3 in strains 1A-P3812 (from the Peterhof genetic stocks) for individual clones reached 85%, i.e. close to that of the other plasmids. Genetic analysis showed that the capacity of strain 1A-P3812 to stably retain RcpCEN3 has a recessive polygenic character. We suggest that the observed differences in mitotic stability of centromeric plasmid RcpCEN3 between various yeast strains reflects the differences in activity of rDNA replicator in these strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1

Identification of polymorphic structural variants.The two large ribsomal RNA subunits of Schistosoma mansoni are encoded within a 10 000-base sequence, which is tandemly repeated in the schistosome genome. Restriction endonuclease digestion with Bam HI cuts the rRNA gene into three fragments, which have been clones separately in pBR322 and used to constract a physical map of the gene. The sequence encoding the smaller rRNA subunit is about 2000 bases in length and is situated on the 5' sie of the sequence encoding the larger subunit, which is about 4000 bases. Approximately 4000 bases of the rRNA gene are spacer and do not code for mature rRNA. There are approximately 100 copies of the rRNA gene per haploid genome of which about 10% exhibit length heterogeneity, as judged by the hybridization of the <e>rDNA</e> plasmids to restriction endonuclease digests of genomic DNA.

By using a subcloned 1.2-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment, including the initiation region of the 45S rRNA transcription unit, it was shown that the snPI RNA sequences are located within the first 600 nucleotides of the 5' end of the external transcribed spacer. Strand-specific hybridization following exonuclease III digestion of the plasmid containing the 1.2-kb Eco-Sal fragment demonstrated that the snPI RNA molecules and the 45S pre-rRNA are transcribed from the same coding strand.

IFN was administered in escalating IM doses in separate groups of patients daily for 14 days and then twice weekly for a further 10 weeks. The dosage levels were 1, 3, 10, and 30 million U/injection. Subjective toxicity could be divided into two types, acute and chronic. The acute reactions took the form of an influenza-like syndrome consisting in chills, rigors, headache, tremor, nausea, vomiting, and myalgia. These symptoms were dose-related but tachyphylaxis developed with continued dosing. The chronic toxicity consisted of malaise, lethargy, fatigue, anorexia, and confusion. These symptoms were not so dose-dependent and tended to become more severe with prolonged treatment. Objective toxicity consisted of myelosuppression and liver dysfunction. Granulocyte counts below 1.0 X 10(9)/l were seen in three patients at the 30-million-U level, with platelet counts less than 100 X 10(9)/l in two of these. Elevation of the liver enzymes were seen in all five patients treated at 30 million U, but returned to normal after 1 week without IFN in all but one patient. A tolerable dose (IM) for phase II/III studies lies between 3 and 10 million U for daily scheduling and between 10 and 30 million U for twice-weekly injections.",M1

Transformed cells were then analyzed by Southern blot hybridization and hybridization in situ to determine whether integration of the exogenous DNA occurred at regions of chromosomal homology i.e., at the 5S rDNA regions. Four cell lines were analyzed by Southern blots. Differences in restriction endonuclease specificity strongly suggested that integration was at a different site in each cell line. Two cell lines were further analyzed by hybridization in situ; each showed a single integration site, both different from each other and different from the mouse L cell 5S rDNA sites. Therefore, the presence of two copies of the 5S rDNA gene in the DNA introduced by gene transfer and approximately 300-350 copies of the mouse 5S rDNA gene was not sufficient in these experiments to produce homologous integration into a specific site.",M1

6344082,"Mitotic and meiotic stability of linear plasmids in yeast.Circular recombinant DNA plasmids that contain autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) are maintained in extrachromosomal form in transformed yeast cells. However, these plasmids are unstable, being rapidly lost from cells growing without selection. Although the stability of such a plasmid can be increased by the presence of yeast centromere DNA (CEN), even CEN plasmids are lost at a high rate compared to a bona fide yeast chromosome. Natural yeast chromosomes are linear molecules; therefore, we have asked if linearization can improve the stability of recombinant DNA plasmids. Linear plasmids with and without yeast CENs were constructed in vitro by using termini from the extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA (<e>rDNA</e>) of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila as  telomeres.  These linear plasmids transformed yeast at high frequency and were maintained as linear extrachromosomal molecules during mitotic growth. Moreover, linear plasmids containing CENs were also transmitted through meiosis: these plasmids segregate predominantly 2+:2- at the first meiotic division, indicating that Tetrahymena rDNA termini can provide telomere function during yeast meiosis. Linear plasmids without CENs were about as stable in mitosis as the comparable circular plasmid. Thus, the Tetrahymena rDNA termini have no marked positive or negative effect on the mitotic stability of ARS plasmids. However, linear plasmids containing CENs are three to four times less stable in mitotic cells than circular CEN plasmids. This decrease in stability is not due to a functional change in the centromere itself; rather, linearization of a CEN plasmid has a direct detrimental effect on its mitotic stability. These results may reflect the existence of spatial constraints on the positions of centromeres and telomeres, constraints which must be satisfied to achieve stable segregation of chromosomes during mitosis.",M1

We have constructed a set of hybrid plasmids containing the bacterial vector pBR325, the LEU2 gene of yeast encoding beta-isopropylmalatedehydrogenase and various EcoRI restriction fragments of the 3mu DNA. We have tested the ability of our hybrid plasmids to transform LEU2 strain DC5 to leucine prototrophy. One of the plasmids Rcp21/11 transforms DC5 at the frequency comparable with that obtained with YEp13, containing the 2mu DNA replication origin. The 2400 bp EcoRI-B fragment of the 3mu DNA in Rcp21/11 carries a gene for 5S rRNA and two spacers. Our results on transformation experiments allow un to suggest that this EcoRI fragment also carries the 3mu DNA replication origin. Yeast transformants containing this plasmid are highly unstable but during the prolonged growth in selective conditions the stabilization of the LEU+ phenotype is observed being most likely a result of integration of Rcp21/11 into the yeast chromosome.",M1

Alternatively, the size of DNA which was protected against nuclease S1 due to hybrid formation with 35S pre-rRNA was estimated to be 490 nucleotides long.

20524591,"Two new species of dictyostelid cellular slime molds from Alaska.In sampling soils to survey dictyostelid cellular slime molds in Alaska we encountered two groups of isolates that have morphologies that differ from any previously described species within their group. We sequenced the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU <e>rDNA</e>) of selected isolates from the two groups and found sequences from both groups to be distinct from all previously described dictyostelid sequences. Phylogenetic analyses place one novel species in dictyostelid Group 2 and the other in Group 4 (Schaap et al. 2006). In this paper we formally describe as new these two species of cellular slime molds, Dictyostelium ammophilum sp. nov. and Dictyostelium boreale sp. nov., based on the combination of morphological and molecular characters.",M2

The symptom displayed as skin ulceration and the inside apparatus turned white. METHODS: We isolated a dominant bacterial strain from the diseased Miichthys and assigned it as strain 090212. The artificial infection test proved that the isolate 090212 was the pathogenic bacterium that caused the disease. We applied physiological and biochemical characterization and API system in the bacterial classification. In order to confirm the result, we amplified a 1458bp sequence of 090212' s 16S <e>rDNA</e> and compared with other Vibrio in GenBank. RESULTS: The results turned out that 090212 was Gram negative and short rod with single polar flagellum. Homology analysis and phylogenetic study showed that strain 090212 had the highest similarity to Vibrio harveyi, with 99% identity. The sensitivity test of strain 090212 to 28 kinds of antibiotics revealed that the pathogen was sensitive to drugs such as Florfenicol and Tetracycline. CONCLUSION: This paper revealed for the first time that the causative pathogen, Vibrio harveyi, lead to the mass mortality of Miichthys, which will be helpful in the disease control and health management during Miichthys cultivation.",M2
20482870,"Ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetic position of a novel euglenozoan with extrusive episymbiotic bacteria: Bihospites bacati n. gen. et sp. (Symbiontida).BACKGROUND: Poorly understood but highly diverse microbial communities exist within anoxic and oxygen-depleted marine sediments. These communities often harbour single-celled eukaryotes that form symbiotic associations with different prokaryotes. During low tides in South-western British Columbia, Canada, vast areas of marine sand become exposed, forming tidal pools. Oxygen-depleted sediments within these pools are distinctively black at only 2-3 cm depth; these layers contain a rich variety of microorganisms, many of which are undescribed. We discovered and characterized a novel (uncultivated) lineage of heterotrophic euglenozoan within these environments using light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, serial sectioning and ultrastructural reconstruction, and molecular phylogenetic analyses of small subunit <e>rDNA</e> sequences. RESULTS: Bihospites bacati n. gen. et sp. is a biflagellated microbial eukaryote that lives within low-oxygen intertidal sands and dies within a few hours of exposure to atmospheric oxygen. The cells are enveloped by two different prokaryotic episymbionts: (1) rod-shaped bacteria and (2) longitudinal strings of spherical bacteria, capable of ejecting an internal, tightly wound thread. Ultrastructural data showed that B. bacati possesses all of the euglenozoan synapomorphies. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses of SSU rDNA sequences demonstrated that B. bacati groups strongly with the Symbiontida: a newly established subclade within the Euglenozoa that includes Calkinsia aureus and other unidentified organisms living in low-oxygen sediments. B. bacati also possessed novel features, such as a compact C-shaped rod apparatus encircling the nucleus, a cytostomal funnel and a distinctive cell surface organization reminiscent of the pellicle strips in phagotrophic euglenids. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized the ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetic position of B. bacati n. gen. et sp. Molecular phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that this species belongs to the Euglenozoa and currently branches as the earliest diverging member of the Symbiontida. This is concordant with ultrastructural features of B. bacati that are intermediate between C. aureus and phagotrophic euglenids, indicating that the most recent ancestor of the Symbiontida descended from phagotrophic euglenids. Additionally, the extrusive episymbionts in B. bacati are strikingly similar to so-called  epixenosomes , prokaryotes previously described in a ciliate species and identified as members of the Verrucomicrobia. These parallel symbioses increase the comparative context for understanding the origin(s) of extrusive organelles in eukaryotes and underscores how little we know about the symbiotic communities of marine benthic environments.",M2
20469641,"Amylolytic Lactobacillus strains from Bulgarian fermented beverage boza.The lactic acid fermentation is a worldwide method for cereal processing. Great diversity of fermented foods and drinks is produced with the participation of amylolytic lactic acid bacteria (ALAB). In the present study the ALAB content of the Bulgarian cereal beverage  boza  was investigated. Two strains, Bom 816 and N3, were found to possess significant amylolytic activity. The strains' identification was based on genetic criteria, namely amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and sequencing of the 16S <e>rDNA</e>. The strain Bom 816 belongs to the species Lactobacillus plantarum and N3 to Lactobacillus pentosus, being the first amylolytic representative of this species. Optimization of the media composition with starch as a sole carbon source was done. The starch hydrolysis was most efficient in medium containing 4 g/l yeast and 8 g/l meat extracts. Thus, L. plantarum Bom 816 consumed 14 g/l starch, while L. pentosus N3 consumed 17 g/l. The highest values of lactic acid reached were 9.5 g/l produced by Bom 816 and 5.5 g/l produced by N3. In the presence of yeast extract L. pentosus N3 formed 0.8-1 g/l succinic acid. Both strains produced mainly cell-bound enzymes with amylase activity, at a pH optimum of 5.5, ranging from 3-4 to 21 U/ml for L. pentosus N3 and from 0.5 to 11.5 U/ml for L. plantarum Bom 816, in dependence of the assay conditions.",M2
20456234,"Diversity of mitochondrial large subunit <e>rDNA</e> haplotypes of Glomus intraradices in two agricultural field experiments and two semi-natural grasslands.Glomus intraradices, an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), is frequently found in a surprisingly wide range of ecosystems all over the world. It is used as model organism for AMF and its genome is being sequenced. Despite the ecological importance of AMF, little has been known about their population structure, because no adequate molecular markers have been available. In the present study we analyse for the first time the intraspecific genetic structure of an AMF directly from colonized roots in the field. A recently developed PCR-RFLP approach for the mitochondrial rRNA large subunit gene (mtLSU) of these obligate symbionts was used and complemented by sequencing and primers specific for a particularly frequent mtLSU haplotype. We analysed root samples from two agricultural field experiments in Switzerland and two semi-natural grasslands in France and Switzerland. RFLP type composition of G. intraradices (phylogroup GLOM A-1) differed strongly between agricultural and semi-natural sites and the G. intraradices populations of the two agricultural sites were significantly differentiated. RFLP type richness was higher in the agricultural sites compared with the grasslands. Detailed sequence analyses which resolved multiple sequence haplotypes within some RFLP types even revealed that there was no overlap of haplotypes among any of the study sites except between the two grasslands. Our results demonstrate a surprisingly high differentiation among semi-natural and agricultural field sites for G. intraradices. These findings will have major implications on our views of processes of adaptation and specialization in these plant/fungus associations.",M2
20409165,"Variability of 18S <e>rDNA</e> locus among Symphysodon fishes: chromosomal rearrangements.Three species of cichlids belonging to the genus Symphysodon have demonstrated interspecific and intraspecific variation in nucleolus organizer regions (NOR) detected with silver nitrate. In order to understand the evolution of this marker in the genus, the structural variability of these sequences in mitotic chromosomes from Symphysodon aequifasciatus, Symphysodon discus and Symphysodon haraldi was investigated using both silver nitrate impregnation and hybridization of the 18S rRNA gene probe. For the three species, the two markers were intraspecifically and interspecifically variable both in the number and in the size of the sites. This polymorphism may stem from duplications and translocations, which suggests that structural chromosome rearrangements effectively act in the karyoevolution of wild Symphysodon species and may have favoured the adaptability of these fishes to diverse aquatic environments in the Amazon.",M2
20404462,"Identification of Candida species using PCR-RFLP in cancer patients in Iran.Opportunistic infections caused by Non-Candida albicans. have been increasing. Traditional methods that are used to identify clinical isolates of Candida species are time-consuming and not appropriate for rapid, accurate and reliable identification. PURPOSE: To identify Candida spp isolated from cancer patients using PCR-restriction enzyme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using universal primers, ITS1 and ITS4, in this study, we could amplify ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 <e>rDNA</e> regions at both 80 clinical isolates and 3 standard strains. The PCR products were digested with two restriction enzymes MspI and BlnI separately. RESULT: We successfully identified all isolated species using two restriction enzymes (MspI, BlnI). Candida albicans was the most common species (77.5%), followed by C. glabrata (15%), C. tropicalis (5%), C. krusei (2.5%). Although the primers and enzyme had the ability to identify C. parapsilosis, C. guilliermondii, C. dubliniensis, present isolates did not include these among identified ones. CONCLUSION: RFLP-PCR using ITSI and ITS4 primers and restriction enzyme is a rapid, easy, reliable and also applicable method in clinical laboratory for identification of medically important Candida spp.",M2
20393578,"Transcript counting in single cells reveals dynamics of <e>rDNA</e> transcription.Most eukaryotes contain many tandem repeats of ribosomal RNA genes of which only a subset is transcribed at any given time. Current biochemical methods allow for the determination of the fraction of transcribing repeats (ON) versus non-transcribing repeats (OFF) but do not provide any dynamical information and obscure any transcription activity at the single-cell level. Here, we use a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique that allows the detection of single-RNA molecules in individual yeast cells. We use this method complemented with theoretical modeling to determine the rate of switching from OFF to ON (activation rate) and the average number of RNA molecules produced during each transcriptional burst (burst size). We explore how these two variables change in mutants and different growth conditions, and show that this method resolves changes in these two variables even when the average rDNA expression is unaltered. These phenotypic changes could not have been detected by traditional biochemical assays.",M2
20389035,"Karyological Features of Achyrocline (Asteraceae, Gnaphalieae): stable karyotypes, low DNA content variation and linkage of rRNA genes.Many Achyrocline (Asteraceae, tribe Gnaphalieae) species are widely used in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay as popular medicinal and aromatic plants. Achyrocline flaccida, A. satureioides, A. alata, and A. crassiuscula are distributed in Uruguay and popularly known as 'marcelas'. In order to characterize them, we performed chromosome counts, compared the karyotypes, mapped the 5S and 45S <e>rDNA</e> sites by fluorescent in situ hybridization, and estimated their DNA content. All species were diploid with 2n = 28 chromosomes, this being the first report for A. flaccida and A. crassiuscula. All species showed symmetrical karyotypes composed exclusively of biarmed chromosomes. DNA content estimated by flow cytometry revealed 2C values ranging from 5.73 to 6.03 pg, the amounts for A. alata and A. crassiuscula being higher than those for the other species. Cytogenetic mapping of 5S and 45S rDNA sequences in three species, A. flaccida, A. satureioides and A. alata, showed that in these species both sites co-localized in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10. This site corresponds to the only DAPI(-) and CMA(+) band of their genomes. Southern blot hybridization of 5S and 45S rDNA on BamHI digested genomic DNA confirmed the tight linkage of these rDNA families into a single unit. Cytological data indicate that Achyrocline species are karyologically poorly differentiated, whereas the uncommon distribution of 5S and 45S rDNA suggests a close relationship with other genera of the Anthemidae tribe.",M2
20388205,"Diverse modes of reproduction in the marine free-living ciliate Glauconema trihymene.BACKGROUND: Most free-living ciliates reproduce by equal fission or budding during vegetative growth. In certain ciliates, reproduction occurs inside the cyst wall, viz. reproductive cysts, but more complex reproductive strategies have generally been thought to be confined to parasitic or symbiotic species, e.g. Radiophrya spp. RESULTS: In addition to equal fission, asymmetric binary division and reproductive cysts were discovered in the free-living bacterivorous scuticociliate Glauconema trihymene Thompson, 1966. Asymmetric division is an innate physiological state that can be induced by sufficient food, and the higher the food concentration, the longer the asymmetric division persists. During asymmetric division, nuclear and somatic structures divide with transiently arrested cytokinesis and variable positioning of macronuclei. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the small subunit of ribosomal DNA (SSU <e>rDNA</e>) sequences, showed that the G. trihymene isolate studied here nests with typical scuticociliates and is paraphyletic to both the symbiotic apostome and astome ciliates, some of which also produce progeny by asymmetric division. CONCLUSIONS: The asymmetric division in G. trihymene has no precedent among undisturbed free-living ciliates. The coexistence of multiple modes of reproduction may represent a previously undescribed reproductive strategy for ciliates living on food patches in coastal waters. This may also be indicative of similar reproductive strategies among other polyphenic ciliates, which have not been intensively studied. Asymmetric division provides a special opportunity for studying ciliates' phenotypic plasticity and may also illuminate the origins of multicellularity.",M2
20387741,"Free-living Amoebae (FLA): morphological and molecular identification of Acanthamoeba in dental unit water.The aim of our study was to detect free-living Amoebae (FLA) by morphological methods and to identify Acanthamoeba spp. by PCR in the dental unit water lines (DUWL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: it was a prospective study dealing with 196 water samples collected from DUWL (94 samples taken in the early morning before materials flush and patient consultations and 102 samples taken after consultations). At the same time, 39 samples from tap water were realized. RESULTS: 135 (69%) samples were positives by the morphological study with morpholypical diversity. The predominant morphotype was the monopodial (39.2%). 18 strains of Acanthamoeba spp. were detected in DUW (13.%) and three strains in tap water (10%). The amplification of 18S <e>rDNA</e> gene of these strains of Acanthamoeba spp. was positive for all samples. CONCLUSION: the FLA and Acanthamoeba were isolated both in tap water and in dental unit. The amoeba pathogenicity has not been demonstrated after oral or dental contamination; but the presence of intracellular and pathogenic bacteria in the amoeba could be a source of microbiological risks for patients in case of deep dental care or immunodepression. The improvement of this dental unit was necessary by putting a filter of 0.2 microns porosity before the arrival of the water in hand-pieces allowing the limitation of FLA passage.",M2
20387473,"[Screening and identification of exopolysaccharide-producing yeasts]OBJECTIVE: Most of microbial extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) has the favorable functionality and peculiarity, but little research has been done about EPS that were synthesized by yeasts. Screening of EPS-producing yeasts and studies on the optimal culture composition are the main purpose of this study. METHODS: Yeasts were obtained by screening from natural samples using spread-plate method, Yield of EPS synthesized by yeasts was estimated by phenolsulfate acid method, Based on 5.8S <e>rDNA</e> sequence determination, three strains were identified and selected for the optimization of fermentative medium. RESULTS: 132 yeast strains were isolated from grapes, preserves and topsoil. Three yeast strains were proved to be as high exopolysaccharide-producing yeasts. The results of 5.8S rDNA sequence determination showed that similarities of two yeasts isolated from  Zuoyouhong  grape (Z14 and Z20) were over 99% compared with Issatchenkia orientalis, meanwhile another yeast L25 isolated from topsoil of Larix gmelini was identified as Cryptococcus humicolus, with the similarity of 98.8%. The optimal medium for strain Z20 for producing EPS was as followed: 8% glucose, 0.2% (NH4)SO4, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.1% yeast extract powder and 0.01% CaCl2. Under the condition of initial pH 6.0, 28 degrees C and 160 r/min for 4 d, yield of EPS could reach to 2.046 g/L, which was 79.9% higher than the control (1.137 g/L). CONCLUSION: Reports that yeasts belong to some genera possessed the abilities to synthesize EPS could be seen in some related references, according to the study, we could get the conclusion that yeasts belong to Issatchenkia can synthesize EPS and EPS yield of stain Z20 could be increased by changing culture composition.",M2
20383659,"Culture-dependent and culture-independent diversity of Actinobacteria associated with the marine sponge Hymeniacidon perleve from the South China Sea.In this report, the diversity of Actinobacteria associated with the marine sponge Hymeniacidon perleve collected from a remote island of the South China Sea was investigated employing classical cultivation and characterization, 16S <e>rDNA</e> library construction, 16S rDNA-restriction fragment length polymorphism (rDNA-RFLP) and phylogenetic analysis. A total of 184 strains were isolated using seven different media and 24 isolates were selected according to their morphological characteristics for phylogenetic analysis on the basis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Results showed that the 24 isolates were assigned to six genera including Salinispora, Gordonia, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Rhodococcus and Streptomyces. This is the first report that Salinispora is present in a marine sponge from the South China Sea. Subsequently, 26 rDNA clones were selected from 191 clones in an Actinobacteria-specific 16S rDNA library of the H. perleve sample, using the RFLP technique for sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. In total, 26 phylotypes were clustered in eight known genera of Actinobacteria including Mycobacterium, Amycolatopsis, Arthrobacter, Brevibacterium, Microlunatus, Nocardioides, Pseudonocardia and Streptomyces. This study contributes to our understanding of actinobacterial diversity in the marine sponge H. perleve from the South China Sea.",M2
20379134,"JmjC enzyme KDM2A is a regulator of rRNA transcription in response to starvation.The rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis is the transcription of ribosomal RNA, which is controlled by environmental conditions. The JmjC enzyme KDM2A/JHDM1A/FbxL11 demethylates mono- and dimethylated Lys 36 of histone H3, but its function is unclear. Here, we show that KDM2A represses the transcription of ribosomal RNA. KDM2A was localized in nucleoli and bound to the ribosomal RNA gene promoter. Overexpression of KDM2A repressed the transcription of ribosomal RNA in a demethylase activity-dependent manner. When ribosomal RNA transcription was reduced under starvation, a cell-permeable succinate that inhibited the demethylase activity of KDM2A prevented the reduction of ribosomal RNA transcription. Starvation reduced the levels of mono- and dimethylated Lys 36 of histone H3 marks on the <e>rDNA</e> promoter, and treatment with the cell-permeable succinate suppressed the reduction of the marks during starvation. The knockdown of KDM2A increased mono- and dimethylated Lys 36 of histone H3 marks, and suppressed the reduction of ribosomal RNA transcription under starvation. These results show a novel mechanism by which KDM2A activity is stimulated by starvation to reduce ribosomal RNA transcription.",M2
20373964,"PWT1, an avirulence gene of Magnaporthe oryzae tightly linked to the <e>rDNA</e> Locus, is recognized by two staple crops, common wheat and barley.The pathogenicity to wheat (Pwt1) locus conditions host species specificity of Magnaporthe oryzae on wheat. GFSI1-7-2 (Setaria isolate) carries the avirulence allele (PWT1) at this locus while Br48 (Triticum isolate) carries the virulence allele (pwt1). An F(1) culture derived from a cross between GFSI1-7-2 and Br48 was backcrossed with Br48 to produce a tester population in which PWT1 alone segregated. When hexaploid wheat lines were inoculated with the BC(1)F(1) testers, they were all resistant to all PWT1 carriers and susceptible to all pwt1 carriers, suggesting that they recognize PWT1. When barley cultivars were inoculated with the testers, they showed the same pattern of reactions as the hexaploid lines, suggesting that the barley cultivars also recognize PWT1. These results suggest that PWT1 is a fundamental gene that universally conditions the avirulence of Setaria isolates on two staple crops, hexaploid wheat and barley. Interestingly, tetraploid wheat lines did not recognize PWT1. Molecular mapping using the F(1) and BC(1)F(1) populations revealed that the Pwt1 locus is located on chromosome 2 and tightly linked to the ribosomal DNA locus and a telomere.",M2
20331768,"Diversity in a hidden world: potential and limitation of next-generation sequencing for surveys of molecular diversity of eukaryotic microorganisms.With the delivery of millions of sequence reads in a single experiment, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is currently revolutionizing surveys of microorganism diversity. In particular, when applied to Eukaryotes, we are still lacking a rigorous comparison of morphological and NGS-based diversity estimates. In this report, we studied the diversity and the seasonal community turnover of alveolates (Ciliophora and Dinophyceae) in an oligotrophic freshwater lake by SSU amplicon sequencing with NGS as well as by classical morphological analysis. We complemented the morphological analysis by single-cell PCR followed by Sanger sequencing to provide an unambiguous link to the NGS data. We show that NGS and morphological analyses generally capture frequency shifts of abundant taxa over our seasonal samples. The observed incongruencies are probably largely due to <e>rDNA</e> copy number variation among taxa and heterogeneity in the efficiency of cell lysis. Overall, NGS-based amplicon sequencing was superior in detecting rare species. We propose that in the absence of other nuclear markers less susceptible to copy number variation, rDNA-based diversity studies need to be adjusted for confounding effects of copy number variation.",M2
20331767,"Multiple marker parallel tag environmental DNA sequencing reveals a highly complex eukaryotic community in marine anoxic water.Sequencing of ribosomal DNA clone libraries amplified from environmental DNA has revolutionized our understanding of microbial eukaryote diversity and ecology. The results of these analyses have shown that protist groups are far more genetically heterogeneous than their morphological diversity suggests. However, the clone library approach is labour-intensive, relatively expensive, and methodologically biased. Therefore, even the most intensive <e>rDNA</e> library analyses have recovered only small samples of much larger assemblages, indicating that global environments harbour a vast array of unexplored biodiversity. High-throughput parallel tag 454 sequencing offers an unprecedented scale of sampling for molecular detection of microbial diversity. Here, we report a 454 protocol for sampling and characterizing assemblages of eukaryote microbes. We use this approach to sequence two SSU rDNA diversity markers-the variable V4 and V9 regions-from 10 L of anoxic Norwegian fjord water. We identified 38 116 V4 and 15 156 V9 unique sequences. Both markers detect a wide range of taxonomic groups but in both cases the diversity detected was dominated by dinoflagellates and close relatives. Long-tailed rank abundance curves suggest that the 454 sequencing approach provides improved access to rare genotypes. Most tags detected represent genotypes not currently in GenBank, although many are similar to database sequences. We suggest that current understanding of the ecological complexity of protist communities, genetic diversity, and global species richness are severely limited by the sequence data hitherto available, and we discuss the biological significance of this high amplicon diversity.",M2
20351095,"Role of direct interactions between the histone H4 Tail and the H2A core in long range nucleosome contacts.In eukaryotic nuclei the majority of genomic DNA is believed to exist in higher order chromatin structures. Nonetheless, the nature of direct, long range nucleosome interactions that contribute to these structures is poorly understood. To determine whether these interactions are directly mediated by contacts between the histone H4 amino-terminal tail and the acidic patch of the H2A/H2B interface, as previously demonstrated for short range nucleosomal interactions, we have characterized the extent and effect of disulfide cross-linking between residues in histones contained in different strands of nucleosomal arrays. We show that in 208-12 5 S <e>rDNA</e> and 601-177-12 nucleosomal array systems, direct interactions between histones H4-V21C and H2A-E64C can be captured. This interaction depends on the extent of initial cross-strand association but does not require these specific residues, because interactions with residues flanking H4-V21C can also be captured. Additionally, we find that trapping H2A-H4 intra-array interactions antagonizes the ability of these arrays to undergo intermolecular self-association.",M2
20348255,"Heterogeneous rpoS and rhlR mRNA levels and 16S rRNA/<e>rDNA</e> (rRNA gene) ratios within Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, sampled by laser capture microdissection.The local environmental conditions in biofilms are dependent on the impinging aqueous solution, chemical diffusion, and the metabolic activities of cells within the biofilms. Chemical gradients established in biofilms lead to physiological heterogeneities in bacterial gene expression. Previously, we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) and quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to target defined biofilm subpopulations for gene expression studies. Here, we combined this approach with quantitative PCR of bacterial DNA to normalize the amount of gene expression per cell. By comparing the ratio of 16S rRNA to 16S rDNA (rRNA gene), we demonstrated that cells at the top of thick Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms have 16S rRNA/genome ratios similar to those of cells in a transition from the exponential phase to the stationary phase. Cells in the middle and bottom layers of these biofilms have ratios that are not significantly different from those of stationary-phase planktonic cultures. Since much of each biofilm appeared to be in a stationary-phase-like state, we analyzed the local amounts of the stationary-phase sigma factor rpoS gene and the quorum-sensing regulator rhlR gene per cell. Surprisingly, the amount of rpoS mRNA was largest at the top of the biofilms at the air-biofilm interface. Less than one rpoS mRNA transcript per cell was observed in the middle or base of the biofilms. The rhlR mRNA content was also greatest at the top of the biofilms, and there was little detectable rhlR expression at the middle or bottom of the biofilms. While the cell density was slightly greater at the bottom of the biofilms, expression of the quorum-sensing regulator occurred primarily at the top of the biofilms, where the cell metabolic activity was greatest, as indicated by local expression of the housekeeping gene acpP and by expression from a constitutive P(trc) promoter. The results indicate that in thick P. aeruginosa biofilms, cells in the 30 microm adjacent to the air-biofilm interface actively express genes associated with stationary phase, while cells in the interior portions do not express these genes and therefore are in a late-stationary-phase-like state and may be dormant.",M2

Recently, 18S rDNA, actin, alpha-, beta-tubulin, and Hsp90-based phylogenies have shown the basal position of the noctilucids. However, the relationships of dinoflagellates in the basal lineages are still controversial. Although the nuclear rDNA (e.g. 18S, ITS-5.8S, and 28S) contains much genetic information, DNA sequences of N. scintillans rDNA molecules were insufficiently characterized as yet. Here the author sequenced a long-range nuclear rDNA, spanning from the 18S to the D5 region of the 28S rDNA, of N. scintillans. The present N. scintillans had a nearly identical genotype (&gt;99.0% similarity) compared to other Noctiluca sequences from different geographic origins. Nucleotide divergence in the partial 28S rDNA was significantly high (p&lt;0.05) as compared to the 18S rDNA, demonstrating that the information from 28S rDNA is more variable. The 28S rDNA phylogeny of 17 selected dinoflagellates, two perkinsids, and two apicomplexans as outgroups showed that N. scintillans and Oxyrrhis marina formed a clade that diverged separately from core dinoflagellates.",M2

'Villafranca') was assessed on the soil aerobic spore-forming bacteria (SFB). The genetically modified poplars, expressing either the StSy gene for resveratrol production or the bar gene for herbicide tolerance, were cultivated in greenhouse. The occurrence of SFB was monitored in soil samples collected at eight different timepoints over a two-year period. The total culturable bacterial population of the StSy and bar trials underwent significant seasonal fluctuations in the range of 10(6)-2.5 x 10(8) CFU/g dry soil and of 10(4)-5 x 10(8) CFU/g dry soil, respectively. Changes occurred also within the culturable SFB population with size varying at 10(3)-5 x 10(4) CFU/g dry soil and 10(2)-2 x 10(5) CFU/g dry soil in the StSy and bar trials, respectively. No significant differences in the size of the total and SFB culturable populations were observed when comparing each transgenic line with the nontransformed control line while seasonal shifts of soil bacterial populations were evident in both trials. The culturable SFB fraction included three isolates (SFB-1, SFB-2 and SFB-3) classified by 16S <e>rDNA</e> sequence analysis as members of the Bacillus genus.

20329699,"Antimicrobial activity of secondary metabolite from marine isolate, Pseudomonas sp. against Gram positive and negative bacteria including MRSA.A proteobacterium isolated from coastal region of Chennai, India, produced appreciable secondary metabolite and partial purification of the obtained secondary metabolite demonstrated antimicrobial activity against both Gram positive and negative organisms including MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Identification of the isolate using biochemical tests, 16s <e>rDNA</e> sequence analysis, G+C content and electron microscopy studies revealed, isolate belonged to Pseudomonas genera. Extraction, purification, characterization and antimicrobial activity of secondary metabolite carried out using various standard instrumental techniques suggested that the active fraction was of 272 m/z with a stable fragment of 244 m/z and also displayed stable free radical activity assessed using EPR analysis. This stable free radical activity of secondary metabolite mediated its antimicrobial activity.",M2
20306024,"Insight into the evolutionary history of symbiotic genes of Robinia pseudoacacia rhizobia deriving from Poland and Japan.The phylogeny of symbiotic genes of Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust) rhizobia derived from Poland and Japan was studied by comparative sequence analysis of nodA, nodC, nodH, and nifH loci. In phylogenetic trees, black locust symbionts formed a branch of their own suggesting that the spread and maintenance of symbiotic genes within Robinia pseudoacacia rhizobia occurred through vertical transmission. There was 99-100% sequence similarity for nodA genes of Robinia pseudoacacia nodulators, 97-98% for nodC, and 97-100% for nodH and nifH loci. A considerable sequence conservation of sym genes shows that the symbiotic apparatus of Robinia pseudoacacia rhizobia might have evolved under strong host plant constraints. In the nodA and nodC gene phylograms, Robinia pseudoacacia rhizobia grouped with Phaseolus sp. symbionts, although they were not closely related to our isolates based on 16S rRNA genes, and with Mesorhizobium amorphae. nifH gene phylogeny of our isolates followed the evolutionary history of 16S <e>rDNA</e> and Robinia pseudoacacia rhizobia grouped with Mesorhizobium genus species. Nodulation assays revealed that Robinia pseudoacacia rhizobia effectively nodulated their native host and also Amorpha fruticosa and Amorpha californica resulting in a significant enhancement of plant growth. The black locust root nodules are shown to be of indeterminate type.",M2
20305980,"PCR-RFLP of 16S ribosomal DNA to confirm the identification of Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus isolated from clinical and food samples.INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to confirm the identification of Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus isolated from clinical and food samples by PCR-RFLP. METHODS: Fifty-two strains identified by conventional biochemical exams were submitted to PCR amplification and digested with HinfI. Only 20 (38.5%) of the 52 strains showed a DNA pattern expected for E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus. RESULTS: Analysis of the results of this study showed that E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus are occasionally erroneously identified and confirmed the potential application of 16S <e>rDNA</e> analysis for accurate identification of these species. CONCLUSIONS: A correct identification is important to distinguish between intrinsic and acquired vancomycin resistance.",M2
20237596,"Codependence of repetitive sequence classes in genomes: phylogenetic analysis of 5S <e>rDNA</e> families in Hordeum (Triticeae: Poaceae).To complete our study of the genus Hordeum and to elaborate a phylogeny of species based upon 5S rDNA sequences, we have cloned and sequenced PCR amplicons from seven American polyploid species to generate 164 new 5S rRNA gene sequences. These sequences were analysed along with the more than 2000 5S rDNA sequences previously generated from the majority of species in Hordeum to provide a comprehensive picture of the distribution (presence or absence) of 5S rDNA unit classes (orthologous groups) in this genus as well as insights into the phylogeny of Hordeum. Testing of substitution models for each unit class based upon the consensus sequences of all the taxa as well as for each unit class within the genus found that the general best fit was TPM3uf+G, from which a maximum-likelihood tree was calculated. A novel application of cophylogenetic analysis, where relationships among unit classes were treated as host-parasite interactions, depicted some significant pair links under tests of randomness indicative of nonrandom codivergence among several unit classes within the same taxon. The previous classification of four genomic groups is reflected in combinations of unit classes, and it is proposed that current taxa developed from ancient diploidized paleopolyploids and that some were subjected to gene loss, i.e., unit class loss. Finally, separate phylogenetic analyses performed for the tetraploid and hexaploid species were used to derive a working model describing the phylogeny of the polyploid taxa from their putative diploid ancestry.",M2
20237595,"Cytological characterization of sunflower by in situ hybridization using homologous <e>rDNA</e> sequences and a BAC clone containing highly represented repetitive retrotransposon-like sequences.In the present work we report new tools for the characterization of the complete chromosome complement of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone containing repetitive sequences with similarity to retrotransposons and a homologous rDNA sequence isolated from the sunflower genome as probes for FISH. The rDNA signal was found in 3 pairs of chromosomes, coinciding with the location of satellites. The BAC clone containing highly represented retroelements hybridized with all the chromosome complement in FISH, and used together with the rDNA probe allowed the discrimination of all chromosome pairs of sunflower. Their distinctive distribution pattern suggests that these probes could be useful for karyotype characterization and for chromosome identification. The karyotype could be subdivided into 3 clear-cut groups of 12 metacentric pairs, 1 submetacentric pair, and 4 subtelocentric pairs, thus resolving previously described karyotype controversies. The use of BAC clones containing single sequences of specific markers and (or) genes associated with important agricultural traits represents an important tool for future locus-specific identification and physical mapping.",M2
20229220,"16SrRNA and enzymatic diversity of culturable bacteria from the sediments of oxygen minimum zone in the Arabian Sea.Sediment underlying the oxygen minimum zone of the eastern Arabian Sea is rich in organic matter. Bacteria in this sediment-water interface are of great ecological importance as they are responsible for decomposing, mineralizing and subsequent recycling of organic matter. This study has for the first time addressed the phylogenetic and functional description of culturable bacteria of this region. Genotypic characterization of the isolates using amplified <e>rDNA</e> restriction analysis (ARDRA) followed by 16SrRNA sequencing grouped them into various phylogenetic groups such as Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria, Low G+C Gram positive bacteria, Actinobacteria and unaffiliated bacteria. Among the enzyme activities, phosphatase was predominant (52%) and was associated with all the phylotypes followed by amylase (37%) and gelatinase (33%). These hydrolytic enzymes were expressed at a wide range of temperature and pH. Firmicutes expressed most of the hydrolytic activities, consistent with a role in degradation of organic matter. Multiple enzyme expression (&gt;/=3) was exhibited by Actinobacteria (100%), followed by unaffiliated group (62.5%) and Firmicutes (61.5%). Besides hydrolytic enzymes, the phylotypes also elaborated functional enzymes such as nitrate reductase and catalase (58 and 81% of the isolates, respectively). In the oxygen minimum zone, the diversity was high with 28 phylotypes. Culturable bacterial assemblages encountered were Bacillus sp., Halobacillus sp., Virgibacillus sp., Paenibacillus sp., Marinilactibacillus sp., Kytococcus sp., Micrococcus sp., Halomonas sp. and Alteromonas sp. The high diversity and high percentage of extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activities of the culturable bacteria reflect their important ecological role in biogeochemical cycling of organic matter in the oxygen minimum zone.",M2
20228579,"A HindIII BAC library construction of Mesobuthus martensii Karsch (Scorpiones:Buthidae): an important genetic resource for comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis.Scorpions are  living but sophisticated fossils  that have changed little in their morphology since their first appearance over the past 450 million years ago. To provide a genetic resource for understanding the evolution of scorpion genome and the relationships between scorpions and other organisms, we first determined the genome size of the scorpion Mesobuthus martensii Karsch (about 600 Mbp) in the order Scorpiones and constructed a HindIII BAC library of the male scorpion M. martensii Karsch from China. The BAC library consists of a total of 46,080 clones with an average insert size of 100 kb, providing a 7.7-fold coverage of the scorpion haploid genome size of 600 Mbp as revealed in this study. High-density colony hybridization-based library screening was performed using 18S-5.8S-28S rRNA gene that is one of the most commonly used phylogenetic markers. Both library screening and PCR identification results revealed six positive BAC clones which were overlapped, and formed a contig of approximately 120 kb covering the <e>rDNA</e>. BAC DNA sequencing analysis determined the complete sequence of M. martensii Karsch rDNA unit that has a total length of 8779 bp, including 1813 bp 18s rDNA, 157 bp 5.8s rDNA, 3823 bp 28s rDNA, 530 bp ETS, 2168 bp ITS1 and 288 bp ITS2. Interestingly, some tandem repeats are present in the rRNA intergenic sequence (IGS) and ITS1/2 regions. These results demonstrated that the BAC library of the scorpion M. martensii Karsch and the complete sequence of rDNA unit will provide important genetic resources and tools for comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis.",M2
20227844,"Comparison of phenotypical and genetic identification of Aeromonas strains isolated from diseased fish.Phenotypicaly identified Aeromonas strains (n=119) recovered mainly from diseased fish were genetically re-identified and the concordance between the results was analysed. Molecular characterization based on the GCAT genus specific gene showed that only 90 (75.6%) strains belonged to the genus Aeromonas. The 16S <e>rDNA</e>-RFLP method identified correctly most of the strains with the exception of a few that belonged to A. bestiarum, A. salmonicida or A. piscicola. Separation of these 3 species was correctly assessed with the rpoD gene sequences, which revealed that 5 strains with the RFLP pattern of A. salmonicida belonged to A. piscicola, as did 1 strain with the pattern of A. bestiarum. Correct phenotypic identification occurred in only 32 (35.5%) of the 90 strains. Only 14 (21.8%) of the 64 phenotypically identified A. hydrophila strains belonged to this species. However, coincident results were obtained in 88% (15/17) of the genetically identified A. salmonicida strains. Phenotypic tests were re-evaluated on the 90 genetically characterized Aeromonas strains and there were contradictions in the species A. sobria for a number of previously published species-specific traits. After genetic identification, the prevailing species were A. sobria, A. salmonicida, A. bestiarum, A. hydrophila, A. piscicola and A. media but we could also identify a new isolate of the recently described species A. tecta. This work emphasizes the need to rely on the 16S rDNA-RFLP method and sequencing of housekeeping genes such as rpoD for the correct identification of Aeromonas strains.",M2

Genomic DNA of Dendrobium was extracted using the modified cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method. The PCR products of the rDNA ITS sequences of Dendrobium (32 materials) were purified and then sequenced. The characteristic of the sequences and the genetic distance were compared between Bulbophyllum odoratissimum and Dendrobium, Dendrobium interspecies and different populations. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the UPGMA method by the biology softwares including BioEdit, MEGA4.0 etc. The PCR products were purified and then sequenced. It was built up that the database of rDNA ITS sequences of 17 species of Herba Dendrobii (32 materials). The ITS1 was 228-234 bp, the GC content accounting for 45.7%-53.0%. Its variable sites were 167, accounting for 67.34%. The Parsim-Informative positions were 106, accounting for 42.74%. The ITS2 was 241-247 bp, the GC accounting for 44.8% - 55.7%. The variable sites were 165, accounting for 66.27%. The Parsim-Informative positions were 115, accounting for 46.18%. The genetic distance between B. odoratissimum and Dendrobium was 0.295. The average genetic distance was 0.142 between Dendrobium species, and there were 2-156 variable nucleotides. The average genetic distance between different populations was 0.002, and there were 2-156 variable nucleotides. The genetic distance between B. odoratissimum and Dendrobium was greater than that of Denrobium interspecies. Meanwhile, the genetic distance between Denrobium species was also greater than that of different populations (varieties). The molecular phylogeny tree was constructed on the database of rDNA ITS the sequences of 17 species of Herba Dendrobii using the biology softwares. Then 10 materials on molecular level were authenticated. It is concluded that using of the whole sequences database of 17 species of Herba Dendrobii and heredity analysis softwares, and measuring the sequences of rDNA ITS of the inspected species, can authenticate the Dendrobium on molecular level, and provide basis for molecular authentication.",M2
20193210,"[Isolation and characterization of Shewanella spp. from patients of food poisoning]OBJECTIVE: To identify the isolates of Shewanella spp. from specimens of food poisoning based on biological and biochemical analysis. METHODS: Strains were obtained from the investigation on two food poisoning episodes in September and October, 2007 in Ma'anshan city, Anhui province. In accordance with the national standard protocol (GB/T 4789), all specimens were enriched and isolated on selective medium, and the suspected strains were identified by the VITEK-32 and API20E systems. For Shewanella spp. identified by the biochemical system, more characteristics were analyzed using auxiliary biochemical, growth, hemolytic and drug-resistance tests. DNAs of Shewanella spp. were extracted, 16S <e>rDNA</e> was PCR amplified and sequenced with universal 16S rDNA primers. Phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 4.0. RESULTS: After enrichment, all specimens were inoculated to selective medium and Shewanella spp. strains were isolated from 8 samples with single colony on both TCBS and BP media. The characteristics of growth in the Triple Sugar Iron (TSI) agar appeared to have had hydrogen sulfide production but no gas production or positive oxidase. No Shewanella spp. strain was detected in WS, SS and EMB media. The 8 strains were identified as Shewanella algae (S. algae) or Shewanella putrefaciens (S. putrefaciens) by VITEK-32, as S. putrefaciens by API20E system. No other enteropathogenic bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris or Staphylococcus aureus, were detected from those 8 samples. From 16S rDNA phylogenetic trees, 7 out of 8 Shewanella spp. were identified as S. algae, 1 as S. putrefaciens. CONCLUSION: Strains of Shewanella spp. were isolated from samples of the food poisoning episodes, providing a possible clue to investigate the role of Shewanella spp. on food poisoning.",M2
20191268,"Evolution of repeated sequences in the ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer of 32 arthropod species.The evolution of a multigene family (MGF) is affected by the structure and function of its regulatory elements, specifically by the link between recombination and DNA transcription and/or replication. The ribosomal DNA (<e>rDNA</e>) MGF is often hierarchically repetitive, combining function with repetition in a single genic system. Its tandemly repeated operons contain the transcription unit of the 45S ribosomal RNA precursor alternating with an intergenic spacer (IGS) that commonly includes repeated transcription regulatory elements. To study the evolution of repeated sequences and the influence of repeat characteristics on their sequence divergence, we sequenced and characterized a single complete IGS from 11 daphniid species and analyzed their repeat arrays along with those from an additional 21 species of arthropods. We tested the hypotheses that sequence similarity is higher among tandemly arrayed repeats than among interleaved or dispersed repeats, and that the homogeneity of repeat arrays is affected by the number and the length of repeats, as well as by the presence of putative regulatory elements. We found that both tandem repeat organization and the presence of a TATA motif are significantly correlated with increased sequence similarity among homologous IGS repeats. We also observed that some repeat types are only found in a single species, while others appear to have persisted for &gt;100 MY, with evidence for homologous repeat types in sister species. Taken together, these data suggest that both drift and natural selection influence repeat evolution within the IGS.",M2
20191263,"Culturable endophytic filamentous fungi from leaves of transgenic imidazolinone-tolerant sugarcane and its non-transgenic isolines.The diversity of endophytic filamentous fungi from leaves of transgenic imidazolinone-tolerant sugarcane plants and its isoline was evaluated by cultivation followed by amplified <e>rDNA</e> restriction analysis (ARDRA) of randomly selected strains. Transgenic and non-transgenic cultivars and their crop management (herbicide application or manual weed control) were used to assess the possible non-target effects of genetically modified sugarcane on the fungal endophytic community. A total of 14 ARDRA haplotypes were identified in the endophytic community of sugarcane. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing revealed a rich community represented by 12 different families from the Ascomycota phylum. Some isolates had a high sequence similarity with genera that are common endophytes in tropical climates, such as Cladosporium, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Guignardia, Pestalotiopsis and Xylaria. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that fluctuations in fungal population were related to both transgenic plants and herbicide application. While herbicide applications quickly induced transient changes in the fungal community, transgenic plants induced slower changes that were maintained over time. These results represent the first draft on composition of endophytic filamentous fungi associated with sugarcane plants. They are an important step in understanding the possible effects of transgenic plants and their crop management on the fungal endophytic community.",M2
20188628,"Molecular phylogeny of noctilucoid dinoflagellates (Noctilucales, Dinophyceae).The order Noctilucales or class Noctiluciphyceae encompasses three families of aberrant dinoflagellates (Noctilucaceae, Leptodiscaceae and Kofoidiniaceae) that, at least in some life stages, lack typical dinoflagellate characters such as the ribbon-like transversal flagellum or condensed chromosomes. Noctiluca scintillans, the first dinoflagellate to be described, has been intensively investigated. However, its phylogenetic position based on the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU <e>rDNA</e>) sequence is unstable and controversial. Noctiluca has been placed either as an early diverging lineage that diverged after Oxyrrhis and before the dinokaryotes -core dinoflagellates- or as a recent lineage branching from unarmoured dino fl agellates in the order Gymnodiniales. So far, the lack of other noctilucoid sequences has hampered the elucidation of their phylogenetic relationships to other dino fl agellates. Furthermore, even the monophyly of the noctilucoids remained uncertain. We have determined SSU rRNA gene sequences for Kofoidiniaceae, those of the type Spatulodinium (=Gymnodinium) pseudonoctiluca and another Spatulodinium species, as well as of two species of Kofoidinium, and the first gene sequence of Leptodiscaceae, that of Abedinium (=Leptophyllus) dasypus. These taxa were collected from their type localities, the English Channel and the NW Mediterranean Sea, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses place the Noctilucales as a monophyletic group at a basal position close to parasites of the Marine Alveolate Group I (MAGI) and the Syndiniales (MAGII), before the core of dinokaryotic dinoflagellates, although with moderate support.",M2
20179323,"Replication fork arrest and <e>rDNA</e> silencing are two independent and separable functions of the replication terminator protein Fob1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.The replication terminator protein Fob1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is multifunctional, and it not only promotes polar replication fork arrest at the tandem Ter sites located in the intergenic spacer region of rDNA but also loads the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2 at Ter sites via a protein complex called RENT (regulator of nucleolar silencing and telophase exit). Sir2 is a component of the RENT complex, and its loading not only silences intrachromatid recombination in rDNA but also RNA polymerase II-catalyzed transcription. Here, we present three lines of evidence showing that the two aforementioned activities of Fob1 are independent of each other as well as functionally separable. First, a Fob1 ortholog of Saccharomyces bayanus expressed in a fob1Delta strain of S. cerevisiae restored polar fork arrest at Ter but not rDNA silencing. Second, a mutant form (I407T) of S. cerevisiae Fob1 retained normal fork arresting activity but was partially defective in rDNA silencing. We further show that the silencing defect of S. bayanus Fob1 and the Iota407Tau mutant of S. cerevisiae Fob1 were caused by the failure of the proteins to interact with two members of the S. cerevisiae RENT complex, namely S. cerevisiae Sir2 and S. cerevisiae Net1. Third, deletions of the intra-S phase checkpoint proteins Tof1 and Csm3 abolished fork arrest by Fob1 at Ter without causing loss of silencing. Taken together, the data support the conclusion that unlike some other functions of Fob1, rDNA silencing at Ter is independent of fork arrest.",M2

20168301,"Chromatin association and regulation of <e>rDNA</e> transcription by the Ras-family protein RasL11a.RasL11a and RasL11b are Ras super-family proteins of unknown function. Here, we show that RasL11a is a chromatin-associated modulator of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) synthesis. RasL11a was found in the nucleolus of interphase mouse fibroblasts, where it co-localized with the RNA polymerase I-specific transcription factor UBF. Similar to UBF, RasL11a also marked the active subset of rDNA repeats (also called nucleolar organizers, or NORs) on mitotic chromosomes. In cells, RasL11a existed in stable complexes with UBF and, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation, distributed along the rDNA transcription unit. Upon treatment of cells with actinomycin D, RasL11a and UBF persisted on the transcription unit beyond the release of RNA polymerase I, and remained co-localized in peri-nucleolar cap structures. Ectopic expression of RasL11a enhanced pre-rRNA levels in cells, whereas RasL11a knockdown had the opposite effect. In transient transfection experiments, RasL11a enhanced the transcriptional activity of an RNA polymerase I-specific reporter controlled by the rDNA enhancer/promoter region. We speculate that RasL11a acts in concert with UBF to facilitate initiation and/or elongation by RNA polymerase I in response to specific upstream stimuli.",M2
20165963,"Physical mapping of <e>rDNA</e> genes corroborates allopolyploid origin in apomictic Brachiaria brizantha.Brachiaria (Trin.) Griseb belongs to the family Poaceae, and within the genus, apomixis or sexuality is present in different accessions of the same species. The majority of Brachiaria species are polyploid and apomictic, making strategies for crop improvement by breeding very intricate. In spite of the high frequency of apomictic polyploids, the relationship of polyploidy and hybridization with apomixis in Brachiaria is still unclear. Further analysis requires detailed knowledge regarding the genomic composition of the polyploids. The present work introduces the use of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) into cytogenetic analysis of Brachiaria. Physical mapping of heterologous rDNA sequences, associated with conventional karyotyping of the B. brizantha diploid sexual (BRA 002747) and the tetraploid apomictic (BRA000591) accessions, provided evidence of the latter being of allopolyploid origin. Based on our results and on previous knowledge on apomixis in B. brizantha, we suggest that the origin of apomixis was probably a consequence of hybridization.",M2
20154141,"Alternative chromatin structures of the 35S rRNA genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provide a molecular basis for the selective recruitment of RNA polymerases I and II.In all eukaryotes, a specialized enzyme, RNA polymerase I (Pol I), is dedicated to transcribe the 35S rRNA gene from a multicopy gene cluster, the ribosomal DNA (<e>rDNA</e>). In certain Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants, 35S rRNA genes can be transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In these mutants, rDNA silencing of Pol II transcription is impaired. It has been speculated that upstream activating factor (UAF), which binds to a specific DNA element within the Pol I promoter, plays a crucial role in forming chromatin structures responsible for polymerase specificity and silencing at the rDNA locus. We therefore performed an in-depth analysis of chromatin structure and composition in different mutant backgrounds. We demonstrate that chromatin architecture of the entire Pol I-transcribed region is substantially altered in the absence of UAF, allowing RNA polymerases II and III to access DNA elements flanking a Pol promoter-proximal Reb1 binding site. Furthermore, lack of UAF leads to the loss of Sir2 from rDNA, correlating with impaired Pol II silencing. This analysis of rDNA chromatin provides a molecular basis, explaining many phenotypes observed in previous genetic analyses.",M2
20153592,"Phylogenetic diversity and antimicrobial activities of bryozoan-associated bacteria isolated from Mediterranean and Baltic Sea habitats.To date, only a small number of investigations covering microbe-bryozoa associations have been carried out. Most of them have focused on a few bryozoan species and none have covered the antibacterial activities of associated bacteria. In the current study, the proportion and phylogenetic classification of Bryozoan-associated bacteria with antimicrobial properties were investigated. Twenty-one specimens of 14 different bryozoan species were collected from several sites in the Baltic and the Mediterranean Sea. A total of 340 associated bacteria were isolated, and 101 displayed antibiotic activities. While antibiosis was predominantly directed against Gram-positive test strains, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed affiliation of the isolates to Gram-negative classes (Flavobacteria, Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria). One isolate was related to the Gram-positive Actinobacteria. The sequences were grouped into 27 phylotypes on the basis of similarity values &gt;or=99.5%. A host-specific affiliation was not revealed as members of the same phylotype were derived from different bryozoan species. Site-specific patterns, however, were demonstrated. Strains of the genera Sphingomonas and Alteromonas were exclusively isolated from Mediterranean sites, whereas Shewanella, Marinomonas and Vibrio-related isolates were only from Baltic sites. Although Pseudoalteromonas affiliated strains were found in both habitats, they were separated into respective phylotypes. Isolates with 16S <e>rDNA</e> similarity values &lt;98%, which could possibly represent new species, belonged to the genera Shewanella, Pseudoalteromonas and Tenacibaculum.",M2
20153382,"Development of a Real-Time PCR assay for quantitative assessment of uncultured freshwater zoosporic fungi.Recently, molecular environmental surveys of the eukaryotic microbial community in lakes have revealed a high diversity of sequences belonging to uncultured zoosporic fungi. Although they are known as saprobes and algal parasites in freshwater systems, zoosporic fungi have been neglected in microbial food web studies. Recently, it has been suggested that zoosporic fungi, via the consumption of their zoospores by zooplankters, could transfer energy from large inedible algae and particulate organic material to higher trophic levels. However, because of their small size and their lack of distinctive morphological features, traditional microscopy does not allow the detection of fungal zoospores in the field. Hence, quantitative data on fungal zoospores in natural environments is missing. We have developed a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for the quantification of fungal zoospores in lakes. Specific primers were designed and qPCR conditions were optimized using a range of target and non-target plasmids obtained from previous freshwater environmental 18S <e>rDNA</e> surveys. When optimal DNA extraction protocol and qPCR conditions were applied, the qPCR assay developed in this study demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity, with as low as 100 18S rDNA copies per reaction detected. Although the present work focuses on the design and optimization of a new qPCR assay, its application to natural samples indicated that qPCR offers a promising tool for quantitative assessment of fungal zoospores in natural environments. We conclude that this will contribute to a better understanding of the ecological significance of zoosporic fungi in microbial food webs of pelagic ecosystems.",M2

20149979,"Pelagodinium gen. nov. and P. béii comb. nov., a dinoflagellate symbiont of planktonic foraminifera.The taxonomic status of the free-living stage of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium béii, symbiont of the foraminifer Orbulina universa, was reassessed on the basis of detailed morpho-genetic analyses. Electron microscopy observations revealed previously undescribed morphological features of the cell that are important for species recognition. The presence of a single elongated apical vesicle (EAV) ornamented with a row of small knobs, absent in species of the genus Gymnodinium, calls into question the current taxonomic position of the symbiont. The presence of a type E extraplastidial eyespot, the arrangement of the amphiesmal vesicles in series and the absence of trichocysts confirm the affiliation with other symbiotic dinoflagellates and certain genetically related non-symbiotic genera, all belonging to the order Suessiales. The arrangement of the series of vesicles of the analyzed strain is unique within the Suessiales, and the ultrastructure of the pyrenoid is different from other symbiotic dinoflagellates. A large subunit (LSU) <e>rDNA</e> phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the analyzed pelagic symbiont clusters in an independent, well-supported clade within the Suessiales with other sequences of symbiotic dinoflagellates extracted from planktonic foraminifera. Hence a novel genus, Pelagodinium gen. nov., is erected for this pelagic, symbiotic dinoflagellate, and Gymnodinium béii is reclassified as Pelagodinium béii.",M2
20149293,"Specific PCR-based assays for the identification of Fasciola species: their development, evaluation and potential usefulness in prevalence surveys.Among the helminths infecting ruminants in China are three taxa belonging to the genus Fasciola: F. hepatica, F. gigantica and the so-called 'intermediate form' that appears to lie between these two species. Based on the sequences of the second internal-transcribed spacers (ITS-2) within the parasites' nuclear ribosomal DNA (<e>rDNA</e>), a pair of primers (DSJf/DSJ3) specific for F. hepatica and a pair (DSJf/DSJ4) specific for F. gigantica were designed and used to develop PCR-based assays. These assays allowed the identification and differentiation of F. hepatica, F. gigantica and the 'intermediate' Fasciola, with no amplicons produced from heterologous DNA samples. The results of sequencing confirmed the species-specific identity of the amplified products. The assays showed good sensitivity, giving positive results with as little as 0.11 ng of F. hepatica DNA and 0.35 ng of F. gigantica DNA. This meant that the DNA from a single Fasciola egg or a single infected snail was sufficient for identification of the Fasciola taxon. The developed PCR assays could provide useful tools for the detection, identification and epidemiological investigation of Fasciola infection in humans, other mammals and snails.",M2
20145294,"Possible ancient origin of heterochromatic JNK sequences in chromosomes 2R of Secale vavilovii Grossh.Employing FISH analysis as well as BLAST and CUSTAL W (1.82) programs, we investigated types of DNA nucleotide sequences building an additional heterochromatic band in 2R chromosomes of 3 lines of Secale vavilovii Grossh. The probes used in FISH analysis were designed based on the reverse transcriptase sequence of Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy retrotransposons and the 5S rRNA gene sequence. No hybridization signals from the reverse transcriptase probes were observed in the chromosome region where the additional band occurs. On the other hand, signals were observed after hybridization with the 5S <e>rDNA</e> probe, clearly suggesting the presence of that type of sequences in the analyzed heterochromatin band. Using BLAST and CUSTAL W programs, we revealed high similarity of the JNK1 sequence to the 5S rRNA gene from Hordeum chilense (HCH1016, HCH1018, 88%) and to a fragment of the 5S rRNA sequence of H. marinum (HMAR003, 97%). In addition, the same fragment of JNK1 was shown to be very similar to the part of the Angela retrotransposon (92%) as well as to the SNAC 426K20-1 transposon (89%) belonging to CACTA family, both from Triticum monococcum, and to Zingeria biebersteiniana pericentromeric sequences (78%). The similarity of JNK1 to those sequences may be accidental or the JNK1 may represent an ancient mobile genetic element that caught the 5S rRNA sequence. During the evolution those sequences might have been accumulated in the particular region on the 2R chromosome. Our results suggest that the additional heterochromatin band in chromosomes 2R of S. vavilovii is a collection of defective genes and/or mobile genetic elements.",M2
20140031,"Comparative cytogenetic analysis of Avena macrostachya and diploid C-genome Avena species.The chromosome set of Avena macrostachya Balansa ex Coss. et Durieu was analyzed using C-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization with 5S and 18S-5.8S-26S rRNA gene probes, and the results were compared with the C-genome diploid Avena L. species. The location of major nucleolar organizer regions and 5S <e>rDNA</e> sites on different chromosomes confirmed the affiliation of A. macrostachya with the C-genome group. However, the symmetric karyotype, the absence of  diffuse heterochromatin  and the location of large C-band complexes in proximal chromosome regions pointed to an isolated position of A. macrostachya from other Avena species. Based on the distribution of rDNA loci on the C-genome chromosomes of diploid and polyploid Avena species, we propose a model of the chromosome alterations that occurred during the evolution of oat species.",M2
20138925,"Monitoring of phytoplankton community structure using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP).To establish molecular monitoring for the phytoplankton community in aquatic ecosystems, we analysed the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (18S <e>rDNA</e>) sequences of nuclear genomes from the algal strains of culture collections and environmental samples of two freshwater reservoirs (Sangcheon reservoir and Seoho reservoir, Korea). Terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) length database was also constructed from twelve strains of algal culture collections to annotate and identify the phytoplankton species from T-RFLP profiles. Algal species in reservoirs were identified and monitored through the colony sequencing and T-RF length patterns of 18S rRNA. In this study, 41 unique clones were identified from two reservoirs including Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, and Alveolata. In the case of Cryptomonas sp., we found significant linear relationships between T-RF peak areas and biovolumes by cell counting. Our results suggest that T-RFLP analysis can be a fast and quantitative monitoring tool for species changes in phytoplankton communities.",M2
20135147,"Molecular biological comparison of different Besnoitia species and stages from different countries.Besnoitia besnoiti tissue cysts from a recent outbreak in cattle in Germany were characterized with respect to their internal transcribed spacer regions 1, 2, and 18S <e>rDNA</e> gene sequences. These results were compared with own sequences of an Israelian isolate of B. besnoiti and of Besnoitia jellisoni cystozoites stored for years in liquid nitrogen. Furthermore, material was studied that was obtained from white mice (Balb/C) that had been successfully infected by intraperitoneal infection of fresh cystozoites from the German outbreak. All results were then compared and discussed with respect to databank sequences of other Besnoitia species. Comprehensive phylogenetic studies of B. besnoiti isolates from Germany revealed almost identical sequence alignments when compared to previously sequenced B. besnoiti isolates from Israel and Spain. More importantly, phylogenetic analysis revealed two distant clusters of Besnoitia species: the first one includes Besnoitia akodoni, Besnoitia darlingi, and Besnoitia oryctofelisi, while the second cluster includes B. besnoiti, Besnoitia bennetti, Besnoitia tarandi, and the Besnoitia species of rodents (B. jellisoni). The also B. jellisoni named species of the GenBank (AF 076860) must be another one, since our strain derives directly from Frenkel. These findings give strong hints that B. besnoiti has a cycle between rodents and a predator and that cattle and other are only accidental hosts.",M2
20134229,"Monitoring the bacterial community dynamics in a petroleum refinery wastewater membrane bioreactor fed with a high phenolic load.The phenolic compounds are a major contaminant class often found in industrial wastewaters and the biological treatment is an alternative tool commonly employed for their removal. In this sense, monitoring microbial community dynamics is crucial for a successful wastewater treatment. This work aimed to monitor the structure and activity of the bacterial community during the operation of a laboratory-scale continuous submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR), using PCR and RT-PCR followed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA libraries. Multivariate analyses carried out using DGGE profiles showed significant changes in the total and metabolically active dominant community members during the 4-week treatment period, explained mainly by phenol and ammonium input. Gene libraries were assembled using 16S <e>rDNA</e> and 16S rRNA PCR products from the fourth week of treatment. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of clones from 16S rDNA library revealed a high diversity of taxa for the total bacterial community, with predominance of Thauera genus (ca. 50%). On the other hand, a lower diversity was found for metabolically active bacteria, which were mostly represented by members of Betaproteobacteria (Thauera and Comamonas), suggesting that these groups have a relevant role in the phenol degradation during the final phase of the SMBR operation.",M2
20133573,"Abundance of ribosomal RNA gene copies maintains genome integrity.The ribosomal RNA (<e>rDNA</e>) gene repeats are essential housekeeping genes found in all organisms. A gene amplification system maintains large cluster(s) of tandemly repeated copies in the chromosome, with each species having a specific number of copies. Yeast has many untranscribed rDNA copies (extra copies), and we found that when they are lost, the cells become sensitive to DNA damage induced by mutagens. We show that this sensitivity is dependent on rDNA transcriptional activity, which interferes with cohesion between rDNA loci of sister chromatids. The extra rDNA copies facilitate condensin association and sister-chromatid cohesion, thereby facilitating recombinational repair. These results suggest that high concentrations of heavily transcribed genes are toxic to the cells, and therefore amplified genes, such as rDNA, have evolved.",M2
20130658,"Species sorting affects bacterioplankton community composition as determined by 16S <e>rDNA</e> and 16S rRNA fingerprints.To understand the mechanisms determining community composition, it is essential to distinctively unravel the importance of local from that of regional processes. In this effort, the mechanisms underlying bacterioplankton community assembly were analysed in eight lakes of short water residence time (WRT) during a four-season sampling campaign. Bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) was determined using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP) on the 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) and 16S rRNA. The relationship between similarity in BCC between a lake and its major inlet on the one hand and cell import per cell production rate from the inlet to the lake epilimnion on the other was used as a measure of the importance of cell dispersal (mass effects) for community assembly. Low similarities in BCC between lakes and their inlets were observed even at short WRTs, and the degree of similarity correlated better with the environmental conditions in lakes and streams than with cell import per cell production rates. Thus, mass effects seemed less important for local lake BCC in comparison to environmental habitat characteristics (species sorting). Analyses of 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA community fingerprints yielded similar results, indicating that species-sorting dynamics exerted an equally important effect on both the abundant and active fraction within the studied bacterioplankton communities.",M2
20129925,"Recognition of histone H3K4 trimethylation by the plant homeodomain of PHF2 modulates histone demethylation.Distinct lysine methylation marks on histones create dynamic signatures deciphered by the  effector  modules, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We identified the plant homeodomain- and Jumonji C domain-containing protein PHF2 as a novel histone H3K9 demethylase. We show in biochemical and crystallographic analyses that PHF2 recognizes histone H3K4 trimethylation through its plant homeodomain finger and that this interaction is essential for PHF2 occupancy and H3K9 demethylation at <e>rDNA</e> promoters. Our study provides molecular insights into the mechanism by which distinct effector domains within a protein cooperatively modulate the  cross-talk  of histone modifications.",M2
20120232,"Morphological and molecular characteristics of a poorly known marine ascomycete, Manglicola guatemalensis (Jahnulales: Pezizomycotina; Dothideomycetes, Incertae sedis): new lineage of marine ascomycetes.The poorly known marine ascomycete Manglicola guatemalensis from Trang and Trat provinces, Thailand, were collected in 2005 and 2006 on the brackish water palm Nypa fruticans. This fungus is known only from two previous collections. This paper reports on the morphological characteristics and molecular phylogeny of this unique marine bitunicate ascomycete. Manglicola guatemalensis has large clavate to obtusely fusiform ascomata, wide ostioles, bitunicate asci, cylindrical, thick-walled, unequally one-septate ascospores, constricted at the septum, apical cell larger, chestnut-brown and a smaller light brown basal cell. Ascospores germinate readily, always from the basal cell. Four isolates from different locations were selected for the phylogenetic study. Regions of the <e>rDNA</e> gene, including SSU and LSU, were sequenced and combined. Molecular data places M. guatemalensis in the Jahnulales with high bootstrap support; all strains are monophyletic. In the combined SSU and LSU analyses the Jahnulales comprises four subclades, A, B, C and D. Subclade A comprises Jahnula species and two anamorphic fungi, Brachiosphaera tropicalis and Xylomyces chlamydosporus. In subclade B Manglicola strains form a sister group of the Aliquandostipite species Aliquandostipite crystallinus, A. khaoyaiensis, Jahnula siamensiae and Patescospora separans. Subclade C comprises Jahnula species, Jahnula aquatica, J. granulosa and J. rostrata, while Megalohypha aqua-dulces constitutes subclade D. Therefore Manglicola forms another lineage of marine fungi.",M2
20119704,"A new species of Calicotyle Diesing, 1850 (Monogenea: Monocotylidae) from the shortspine spurdog Squalus mitsukurii Jordan &amp; Snyder and the synonymy of Gymnocalicotyle Nybelin, 1941 with this genus.Calicotyle japonica n. sp., collected from the uterus, rectal gland, archinephric duct and cloaca of the shortspine spurdog Squalus mitsukurii Jordan &amp; Snyder (Squaliformes) off the Pacific coast of Japan, is described. The new species can be distinguished from C. inermis Woolcock, 1936 by the shape of the male copulatory organ; in C. japonica this is directed anteriorly, is sharply bent in the middle and then increases in width toward the tip, whereas it is long, coiled and uniform in width throughout its entire length in C. inermis. Furthermore, the intestinal caeca have many irregular diverticula on both sides and the vaginal apertures are at the level of the common genital pore in C. japonica, whereas in C. inermis the intestine is smooth and the vaginae open at the level of the oötype. A phylogeny constructed using LSU <e>rDNA</e> data indicates that the new species is grouped with other Calicotyle species; based on this, Gymnocalicotyle Nybelin, 1941 is synonymised with Calicotyle Diesing, 1850. Calicotyle is divided into two major clades, with the new species being grouped with Calicotyle species infecting sharks and the second clade consisting of Calicotyle spp. infecting rays. This suggests that the loss of the hamuli in C. japonica and C. inermis, both parasites of sharks, is a comparatively recent event in the evolution of the genus.",M2

(Cestoda: Trypanorhyncha: Rhinoptericolidae) from Hawaiian fishes.A new trypanorhynch cestode from Hawaiian waters is described based on specimens in the collection of the Meguro Parasitological Museum, Tokyo, and newly collected specimens. Nataliella marcelli n. g., n. sp. is characterised by its elongate, craspedote scolex with four small, ear-shaped bothria, an elongate pars vaginalis and long bulbs. The homeoacanthous homeomorphous metabasal armature is comprised of five or six slender, solid hooks per half spiral row. A distinctive basal armature is present, including a combination of six characteristically shaped macrohooks not previously described for trypanorhynchs. The surface ultrastructure consists of gladiate spiniform microtriches that cover the distal and proximal bothrial surface and filiform microtriches on the scolex peduncle. The adults are not known. Nataliella is assigned to the family Rhinoptericolidae Carvajal &amp; Campbell, 1975 based on its possession of four bothria, prebulbar organs and no chainette or intercalary hooks. The family diagnosis is amended to accommodate the new genus. Rhinoptericola megacantha Carvajal &amp; Campbell, 1975 is considered the most closely related species, a position that has been confirmed by molecular analyses of the SSU and LSU <e>rDNA</e>. Nataliella n. g. is intermediate in morphology between the homeoacanth family Tentaculariidae Poche, 1926 (superfamily Tentacularioidea) and the Rhinoptericolidae and other eutetrarhynchid genera (superfamily Eutetrarhynchoidea), sharing characters of both superfamilies.",M2

Morphological and biochemical characterization placed two bacteria (BC1, Klebsiella oxytoca and BC2, Pantoea agglomerans) into family Enterobacteriaceae and the third one (BC3, Staphylococcus sp.) into family Staphylococcaceae. 16S rDNA gene sequence comparison with the available NCBI database sequences further confirmed the characterizations of bacterial symbionts. Molecular phylogeny of Klebsiella oxytoca and Pantoea agglomerans closely related to the other free living enterobacterial members with 74 to 93% sequence homology (genetic distance 0.000 to 0.085); however, they showed only 74 to 87% similarity with other insect symbionts (genetic distance 0.090 to 0.121). Staphylococcus sp. showed 94% sequence homology with other members of family Staphylococcaceae with the genetic distance of 0.013. Population of these symbionts in adult fruit flies increased exponentially up to the 10th day of adult emergence and thereafter it became almost constant.",M2
20113332,"Ciliate diversity and distribution across an environmental and depth gradient in Long Island Sound, USA.The nature and extent of microbial biodiversity remain controversial with persistent debates over patterns of distributions (i.e. cosmopolitanism versus endemism) and the processes that structure these patterns (neutrality versus selection). We used culture-independent approaches to address these issues focusing on two groups of ciliates, the Oligotrichia (Spirotrichea) and Choreotrichia (Spirotrichea) across an environmental gradient. We assessed SSU <e>rDNA</e> diversity in ciliate communities at six stations in Long Island Sound spanning the frontal region that separates the fresher Connecticut River outflow plume from the open Sound. As in previous studies, we find one abundant cosmopolitan species (Strombidium biarmatum), a few moderately abundant sequences, and a long list of rare sequences. Furthermore, neither ciliate diversity nor species composition showed any clear relationship to measured environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, accessory pigment composition and chorophyll). Overall, we observed that diversity decreased moving from nearshore to offshore. We also conducted analyses to detect clustering among the sampled communities using the software Unifrac. This approach revealed three significant clusters grouping samples from nearshore, surface and deep/well mixed stations. We find no strong fit of our communities to log series, geometric or log normal distributions, though one of the 3 clusters is most consistent with a log series distribution. However, when we remove the abundant cosmopolitan species S. biarmatum, all three clusters fit to a log series distribution. These analyses suggest that, with the exception of one cosmopolitan species, the oligotrich and choreotrich communities at these stations may be distributed in a neutral manner.",M2

The isolate was tentatively identified as Pseudomonas sp. strain DRYJ3 based on partial 16S <e>rDNA</e> molecular phylogeny and Biolog GN microplate panels and Microlog database. Growth on diesel was supported optimally by ammonium sulphate, nitrate and nitrite. The bacterium grew optimally in between 10 and 15 degrees C, pH 7.0 and 3.5% (v/v) diesel. The biodegradation of diesel oil by the strain increased in efficiency from the second to the sixth day of incubation from 1.4 to 18.8% before levelling off on the eighth day n-alkane oxidizing and aldehyde reductase activities were detected in the crude enzyme preparation suggesting the existence of terminal n-alkane oxidizing activity in this bacterium.",M2

To understand the genetic variability and diversity of jujube witches'-broom phytoplasma population from the different cultivars and various regions of China. METHOD: We collected 32 samples from 14 cultivars or wild sour jujubes in 7 regions of China and detected them with PCR with the primers R16mF2/R16mR1 for phytoplasma 16S <e>rDNA</e>, SR1/SR for 16S-23SrRNA space region (SR) and FD9f/r for secretion proteins (secY). The direct sequencing of PCR products and sequencing by cloned PCR products were used for sequence polymorphism and phylogenetic analyses by comparison to the databases of known conserved gene sequences. RESULTS: We detected phytoplasmas by PCR amplification of 16SrDNA from all the diseased jujube samples. All the phytoplasma isolates infected various jujube cultivars belonged to subgroup 16SrV-B of elm yellows group and had closer homology with Bischofia polycarpa witches'-broom and cherry lethal yellows phytoplasmas occurred in China than other 16SrV phytoplasmas in other countries. The sequence polymorphism at different extent in 16SrDNA, SR and secY gene and genetic diversity were revealed in phytoplasma strain population related to different habitats, among which the dominant strains were always detected by the direct sequencing of PCR products in all the diseased areas of China. The degree of variability on secY gene of collected phytoplasma strains was greater than that of 16SrDNA and SR sequences, and some base substitutions could not alter encoded amino acid, however certain single base deletions detected in a Shandong and a Beijing strains may have impact on the gene structure or function. CONCLUSION: Phytoplasma strains from different cultivars and regions show dramatic genetic diversity. Compared with direct sequencing of PCR products, the sequencing by cloning PCR products was more useful for the displaying of variants and phylogeny in phytoplasma strain population.",M2

20112227,"The taxophysiological paradox: changes in the intestinal microbiota of the xylophagous cockroach Cryptocercus punctulatus depending on the physiological state of the host.The phylogenetic relationships of symbiotic bacteria from the xylophagous cockroach Cryptocercus (Cryptocercidae, Blattaria) were compared to those described in previous reports in lower termites. The 16S <e>rDNA</e> bacterial genes were PCR-amplified from DNA isolated from the entire hindgut using Bacteria-selective primers, and the 16S rDNA amplicons were cloned into Escherichia coli. The changes in the gut microbiota of Cryptocercus under three physiological conditions,  active,   fasting,  and  dead,  were studied. Analysis of the active-clone library revealed 45 new phylotypes (clones sharing &gt;97% sequence identity were grouped into the same phylotype) from 54 analyzed clones. The clones were affiliated with the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, Synergistetes, Verrucomicrobia, and candidate phylum Termite Group 1 (TG1). Clones belonging to Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, and TG1 phyla clustered with previously reported sequences obtained from the guts of several termites, suggesting that these clones are common constituents of the intestinal microbiota of lower termites and Cryptocercus. In the fasting-clone library, 19 new phylotypes, from 49 clones studied, were distinguished. The new phylotypes were affiliated with the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Synergistetes, and the candidate phylum TM7. Finally, in the dead-clone library, 24 new phylotypes from 50 studied clones were found. The new phylotypes were affiliated with the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Thus, from active, to fasting, to dead physiological states, a decrease in the number of phyla present in the whole microbial gut was evident. However, in the dead physiological state, each phylum conserved contained more new phylotypes. This poses a taxophysiological paradox, because a stable, active physiological state of Cryptocercus-due to a continuous input of wood-supports a higher diversity of bacterial phyla, probably necessary to maintain a sharp O(2)-H(2) gradient in the gut. By contrast, in the dead state, nutrient input is limited to the residual gut microbiota that is killed by the newly oxic environment, thus providing a food source for other, aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria. This results in an increase in the internal diversity of the few remaining phyla.",M2

In the 3 species, diploid chromosome number was 2n = 60 and karyotypes contained predominantly meta-submetacentric chromosomes. C-banding showed blocks of constitutive heterochromatin mainly in the pericentromeric region. Physical mapping of repetitive 5S rDNA sequences and Rex3 retrotransposons in mitotic and meiotic chromosomes showed partial colocalization of constitutive heterochromatin and repetitive elements. Correlations among the accumulation of repetitive elements, heterochromatinization and chromosome rearrangements have been hypothesized to explain the karyotype differentiation in the Symphysodon genus. The role of repetitive elements in adaptation to highly diverse habitats, as well as in the generation of the phenotypic and genetic variability found in wild Discus populations, needs to be further investigated.",M2
20097131,"Pseudocryptic diversity versus cosmopolitanism in diatoms: a case study on Navicula cryptocephala Kütz. (Bacillariophyceae) and morphologically similar taxa.Despite the significance of diatoms in biomonitoring, many aspects of their biodiversity and geographical distribution are poorly understood. Recent evidence from molecular data has shown that traditional cosmopolitan and euryvalent morphospecies are often heterogeneous, containing cryptic or pseudo-cryptic species. It is important to establish whether these more finely differentiated species are also cosmopolitan or show restricted distributions. According to the standard freshwater diatom floras, Navicula cryptocephala and morphologically similar species (N. veneta, N. trivialis, N. gregaria and N. cryptotenella) are common, cosmopolitan freshwater pennate diatoms. Although allopatric and even sympatric populations of N. cryptocephala are extremely similar morphologically, they have previously been found to be highly polymorphic with respect to reproductive and nuclear characteristics; however, molecular data supporting the existence of cryptic diversity were lacking. Phylogenetic analyses (LSU <e>rDNA</e>, ITS of the rRNA operon) of 52 strains of N. cryptocephala-like diatoms confirmed the existence of genetically distinct lineages within N. cryptocephala, and revealed a close relationship between N. trivialis and N. cryptocephala.

On the basis of sequence analysis of the D1/D2 domains of the 26S rRNA gene and the internally transcribed spacer (ITS)-1 and ITS-2 region sequences, the isolate belonged to the Cryptococcus albidus cluster (Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes) and was closely related to Cryptococcus saitoi, Cryptococcus cerealis and Cryptococcus friedmannii with 98% sequence identity. Phenotypically, the species differed from C. saitoi with respect to growth temperature (up to 37degrees C), presence of a thin capsule, ability to grow in the absence of vitamins, and inability to assimilate citrate and ethylamine. With respect to C. friedmannii, it differed in growth temperature, ability to assimilate lactose, raffinose, L: -rhamnose, myo-inositol, and inability to utilize citrate. Furthermore, our isolate also differed from C. cerealis in growth temperature, presence of capsule and inability to assimilate L: -sorbose. In view of the above phenotypic differences and unique <e>rDNA</e> sequences, we consider that our isolate represents a new species of Cryptococcus, and therefore, a new species, Cryptococcus randhawai is proposed for this taxon.

In dnaK and atpD gene phylograms R. pseudoacacia nodulators formed robust, monophyletic clusters with Mesorhizobium species with the nucleotide sequence similarity of 91-98% and 90-98%, respectively. The classification of R. pseudoacacia rhizobia to the genus Mesorhizobium was also supported by amplified 16S rDNA restriction analysis. The studied bacteria formed common clusters with Mesorhizobium species, and their DNA patterns were identical or nearly identical to Mesorhizobium genus strains. When DNA-DNA hybridization was performed, the total DNA of the representative R. pseudoacacia rhizobia exhibited 51-75% relatedness to DNA of Mesorhizobium amorphae ICMP15022 strain and below 41% to DNA of other Mesorhizobium species. These results showed that R. pseudoacacia and M. amorphae belong to the same genomospecies.

20086297,"Population distribution of 45S and 5S <e>rDNA</e> in golden mahseer, Tor putitora: population-specific FISH marker.Chromosomal locations of major 45S and minor 5S ribosomal DNAs (rDNAs) and organization of 5S rRNA genes were analysed in five different populations of golden mahseers (Tor putitora) using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot hybridization. All five populations of T. putitora (2n = 100) showed a similar type of macro-karyotype composed of 12 metacentric, 22 submetacentric, 14 subtelocentric and 52 telocentric chromosomes. Analysis of active nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) by silver staining did not show any differences in number and chromosomal position in different populations. But FISH data showed significant difference between the populations, four of the five populations showed six 18S (three pairs) and two 5S (one pair) signals with positional polymorphism, while one population showed eight 18S and four 5S signals, respectively. Southern blot data confirms that 5S rDNA clusters present on two different chromosome pairs in Kosi river population contain non-transcribed spacers (NTS) of same length. In the present study, simultaneous localization of 45S and 5S rDNA by in situ hybridization helped us to develop the discrete population-specific markers in different geographically isolated populations of T. putitora.",M2
20075868,"Nucleolar retention of a translational C/EBPalpha isoform stimulates <e>rDNA</e> transcription and cell size.The messenger RNA of the intronless CEBPA gene is translated into distinct protein isoforms through the usage of consecutive translation initiation sites. These translational isoforms have distinct functions in the regulation of differentiation and proliferation due to the presence of different N-terminal sequences. Here, we describe the function of an N-terminally extended protein isoform of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) that is translated from an alternative non-AUG initiation codon. We show that a basic amino-acid motif within its N-terminus is required for nucleolar retention and for interaction with nucleophosmin (NPM). In the nucleoli, extended-C/EBPalpha occupies the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoter and associates with the Pol I-specific factors upstream-binding factor 1 (UBF-1) and SL1 to stimulate rRNA synthesis. Furthermore, during differentiation of HL-60 cells, endogenous expression of extended-C/EBPalpha is lost concomitantly with nucleolar C/EBPalpha immunostaining probably reflecting the reduced requirement for ribosome biogenesis in differentiated cells. Finally, overexpression of extended-C/EBPalpha induces an increase in cell size. Altogether, our results suggest that control of rRNA synthesis is a novel function of C/EBPalpha adding to its role as key regulator of cell growth and proliferation.",M2
20073339,"[Communities of Actynomicetes fungy in three vegetation types of the Colombian Amazon: abundance, morphotypes and the 16s <e>rDNA</e> gene]Among soil microorganisms, Actinomycetes play an important role in the sustainability of natural and agricultural systems: decomposition of organic matter; degradation of recalcitrant compounds like lignin; nitrogen fixation; degradation of agricultural chemicals and biological control in plants and animals. We evaluated their diversity in soils under three different vegetation covers (pasture, tropical primary forest and stubble) at two depths in the Southern Colombian Amazon border. We collected five replicates per vegetation type (in each, three samples at 0-20cm and three at 20-30cm; for a total of 30 samples). Abundance and phenotypic diversity were determined by plate counting. Genomic DNA was extracted from the isolates: the 16s rDNA gene was amplified with specific primers, and its genetic diversity was estimated by means of an amplified restriction analysis (ARDRA). Actynomicetes abundance varied with vegetation and depth, possibly reflecting presence of earthworms, macro-fauna and physico-chemical characteristics associated to fertility, as well as organic matter, total bases, and optimal capacity to cationic interchange. Primary forests had the highest diversity. Sixteen morpho-types (six genera) were identified; Streptomyces was the most abundant everywhere. The heterogeneity ofARDRA patterns prevented species identification because of the intra-species variability in sequences of 16s rDNA operons. This community is a biological indicator of landscape alteration and could include new bio-active compounds of pharmaceutical interest.",M2
20066958,"Phylogeny and morphology of Glugea hertwigi from rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax found in Prince Edward Island, Canada.Infection of rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax with the microsporidian Glugea hertwigi was diagnosed for the first time in Prince Edward Island, Canada. The prevalence of infection was 24%, 45 infected out of 187 examined fish captured in February and March 2009. Both large and small xenomas of G. hertwigi observed within the submucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and along the mesentery of the host contained only mature spores. Advanced and degraded xenomas associated with host reaction were described using light and transmission electron microscopy. The first <e>rDNA</e> sequence of G. hertwigi prepared in the present study completed the set of sequences of Glugea spp. available for comparison. The high level of rDNA sequence identity between Glugea spp. suggests that these may be variants of a single species.",M2
20057111,"Bacterial community structure and diversity during establishment of an anaerobic bioreactor to treat swine wastewater.An upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was successfully established to treat swine wastewater. The bacterial structure and biodiversity of activated sludge in the anaerobic bioreactor were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and amplified 16S <e>rDNA</e> restriction analysis (ARDRA). The UASB reactor was acclimatized with swine wastewater for a period of 36 days and exhibited an increase in daily COD removal rate up to 90% and methane production up to 9.5 L/day for an influent COD of 3,500 mg/L at the end of the start-up period. The reactor was then run continuously with an influent COD of 3,000-6,000 mg/L in the following two months of steady operation, reaching COD removal rate of 90-95% and methane production of 9.5-13.2 L/day respectively. The results of microbial community analysis showed a diversified and abundant bacterial structure and biodiversity during the start-up period, which then changed insignificantly in the steady operation period. The change patterns of the bacterial population function were similar to those of the bioreactor performance, indicating a close relationship between bacterial community structure and treatment efficiency.",M2
19958489,"Phylogenetic reconstruction using secondary structures and sequence motifs of ITS2 <e>rDNA</e> of Paragonimus westermani (Kerbert, 1878) Braun, 1899 (Digenea: Paragonimidae) and related species.BACKGROUND: Most phylogenetic studies using current methods have focused on primary DNA sequence information. However, RNA secondary structures are particularly useful in systematics because they include characteristics that give  morphological  information, not found in the primary sequence. In several mountainous regions of Northeastern India, foci of Paragonimus (lung fluke) infection reportedly involve species that are known to prevail in neighbouring countries. The present study was undertaken to demonstrate the sequence analysis of the ribosomal DNA (ITS2) of the infective (metacercarial) stage of the lung fluke collected from the edible crab hosts that are abundant in a mountain stream of the area (Miao, Changlang District in Arunachal Pradesh) and to construct its phylogeny. Using the approach of molecular morphometrics that is based on ITS2 secondary structure homologies, phylogenetic relationships of the various isolates of Paragonimus species that are prevalent in the neighbouring Near-eastern countries have been discussed. RESULTS: Initially, ten predicted RNA secondary structures were reconstructed and the topology based only on the predicted RNA secondary structure of the ITS2 region resolved most relationships among the species studied. We obtained three similar topologies for seven species of the genus Paragonimus on the basis of traditional primary sequence analysis using MEGA and a Bayesian analysis of the combined data. The latter approach allowed us to include both primary sequence and RNA molecular morphometrics; each data partition was allowed to have a different evolution rate. Paragonimus westermani was found to group with P. siamensis of Thailand; this was best supported by both the molecular morphometrics and combined analyses. P. heterotremus, P. proliferus, P. skrjabini, P. bangkokensis and P. harinasutai formed a separate clade in the molecular phylogenies, and were reciprocally monophyletic with respect to other species. ITS2 sequence motifs allowed an accurate in-silico distinction of lung flukes. CONCLUSION: Data indicate that ITS2 motifs (&lt;or= 50 bp in size) can be considered a promising tool for trematode species identification. RNA secondary structure analysis could be a valuable tool for distinguishing new species and completing Paragonimus systematics, more so because ITS2 secondary structure contains more information than the usual primary sequence alignment.",M2
20051104,"The B chromosomes of the African cichlid fish Haplochromis obliquidens harbour 18S rRNA gene copies.BACKGROUND: Diverse plant and animal species have B chromosomes, also known as accessory, extra or supernumerary chromosomes. Despite being widely distributed among different taxa, the genomic nature and genetic behavior of B chromosomes are still poorly understood. RESULTS: In this study we describe the occurrence of B chromosomes in the African cichlid fish Haplochromis obliquidens. One or two large B chromosome(s) occurring in 39.6% of the analyzed individuals (both male and female) were identified. To better characterize the karyotype and assess the nature of the B chromosomes, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using probes for telomeric DNA repeats, 18S and 5S rRNA genes, SATA centromeric satellites, and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) enriched in repeated DNA sequences. The B chromosomes are enriched in repeated DNAs, especially non-active 18S rRNA gene-like sequences. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the B chromosome could have originated from <e>rDNA</e> bearing subtelo/acrocentric A chromosomes through formation of an isochromosome, or by accumulation of repeated DNAs and rRNA gene-like sequences in a small proto-B chromosome derived from the A complement.",M2
20050011,"Trypanosoma cf. varani in an imported ball python (Python reginus) from Ghana.Peripheral blood from a ball python (Python reginus) imported from Ghana was cultured in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) medium for Borrelia spp. isolation, resulting in the prominent appearance of free, and clusters of, trypanosomes in a variety of morphological forms. The molecular phylogenetic characterization of these cultured trypanosomes, using the small subunit <e>rDNA</e>, indicated that this python was infected with a species closely related to Trypanosoma varani Wenyon, 1908, originally described in the Nile monitor lizard (Varanus niloticus) from Sudan. Furthermore, nucleotide sequences of glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene of both isolates showed few differences. Giemsa-stained blood smears, prepared from the infected python 8 mo after the initial observation of trypanosomes in hemoculture, contained trypomastigotes with a broad body and a short, free flagellum; these most closely resembled the original description of T. varani, or T. voltariae Macfie, 1919 recorded in a black-necked spitting cobra (Naja nigricollis) from Ghana. It is highly possible that lizards and snakes could naturally share an identical trypanosome species. Alternatively, lizards and snakes in the same region might have closely related, but distinct, Trypanosoma species as a result of sympatric speciation. From multiple viewpoints, including molecular phylogenetic analyses, reappraisal of trypanosome species from a wide range of reptiles in Africa is needed to clarify the relationship of recorded species, or to unmask unrecorded species.",M2

This microsporidian is characterized by specificity to the gastric caecae and midgut tissues of the host and a life cycle that is nearly identical to that of Encephalitozoon hellem and Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Mature spores are larger (3.97 x 1.95 microm) than those of other Encephalitozoon species. Polar filament coils number 7 to 8 in a single row. Analysis of the small subunit (SSU) <e>rDNA</e> shows that E. romaleae fits well into the Encephalitozoon group and is a sister taxon to E. hellem.

20050000,"Characterization of Dictyocaulus species (Nematoda: Trichostrongyloidea) from three species of wild ruminants in northwestern Spain.Specimens of Dictyocaulus spp. were extracted from the respiratory tracts of 3 ruminant hosts including roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) from wild populations in the province of Le6n, northwestern Spain. The near-complete nuclear small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene, and 2 regions of the large-subunit ribosomal RNA gene, were amplified by PCR and sequenced. The SSU <e>rDNA</e> gene sequences indicated a high level of similarity between the isolate from C elaphus and the published sequences for Dictyocaulus eckerti. SSU rDNA gene sequences were identical in the isolates from C. capreolus and R. rupicapra, and both corresponded to published sequences for D. capreolus. The LSU rDNA gene sequences differed in isolates from the latter 2 hosts, indicating the possible presence of an undescribed Dictyocaulus sp. in R. rupicapra. These results showed that the LSU rDNA gene sequences are useful indicators of genetic and species diversity in species of Dictyocaulus.",M2
20038608,"RNA polymerase I transcription silences noncoding RNAs at the ribosomal DNA locus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the repeated units of the ribosomal locus, transcribed by RNA polymerase I (Pol I), are interrupted by nontranscribed spacers (NTSs). These NTS regions are transcribed by RNA polymerase III to synthesize 5S RNA and by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to synthesize, at low levels, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). While transcription of both RNA polymerase I and III is highly characterized, at the ribosomal DNA (<e>rDNA</e>) locus only a few studies have been performed on Pol II, whose repression correlates with the SIR2-dependent silencing. The involvement of both chromatin organization and Pol I transcription has been proposed, and peculiar chromatin structures might justify  ribosomal  Pol II silencing. Reporter genes inserted within the rDNA units have been employed for these studies. We studied, in the natural context, yeast mutants differing in Pol I transcription in order to find whether correlations exist between Pol I transcription and Pol II ncRNA production. Here, we demonstrate that silencing at the rDNA locus represses ncRNAs with a strength inversely proportional to Pol I transcription. Moreover, localized regions of histone hyperacetylation appear in cryptic promoter elements when Pol II is active and in the coding region when Pol I is functional; in addition, DNA topoisomerase I site-specific activity follows RNA polymerase I transcription. The repression of ncRNAs at the rDNA locus, in response to RNA polymerase I transcription, could represent a physiological circuit control whose mechanism involves modification of histone acetylation.",M2
20038486,"A polyphasic study on the species diversity of the sediment microbiota of Lake Hévíz.Lake Hévíz is the largest natural thermal lake of Europe, harboring special bacterial communities. The aim of the present study was to gain information about the distribution and species diversity of the sediment microbiota, with special focus on Actinobacteria, by using cultivation-based and -independent molecular methods. Samples from two depths were taken in two different locations in October 2007. 245 strains were isolated, grouped to 85 OTUs by ARDRA, and identified by 16S <e>rDNA</e> sequencing. Most of the strains showed highest sequence similarity with Bacillus and related genera. Strains belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria were identified as members of Arthrobacter, Brachybacterium, Brevibacterium, Curtobacterium, Friedmanniella, Gordonia, Kocuria, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Micromonospora, Mycobacterium, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces and Williamsia . Two clone libraries were constructed from H3M and H4M samples, providing 288 and 192 clones which were grouped to 150 and 125 OTUs, respectively, by ARDRA. The two most abundant group of the H4M library were OP8-related. The phylum Proteobacteria was represented mostly by delta-Proteobacteria, other relevant groups were Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria and beta-Proteobacteria. The H3M library was dominated by Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, beta-Proteobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria and delta-Proteobacteria. Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Spirochetes and Firmicutes were scarce. Results from the clone libraries were compared to the length-heterogeneity-PCR fingerprints of the communities.",M2
20036024,"Occurrence of psychrotolerant Bacillus cereus group strains in ice creams.The occurrences of Bacillus cereus group strains in 40 ice cream samples were investigated. Among 109 isolated B. cereus group strains confirmed by 16S <e>rDNA</e> sequence analysis only 50 were identified as B. cereus and one as B. thuringiensis by using FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) standard, indicating the two identification standards were highly inconsistent. Furthermore, the psychrotolerant growth properties and the occurrence of specific psychrotolerant genes of the isolates were also studied. Both psychrotolerant 16S rDNA fragments and enterotoxic genes could be detected among mesophilic and psychrotolerant strains. No relationship among psychrotolerance, presence of psychrotolerant 16S rDNA fragments and enterotoxic genes were found and the specific cspA fragment was only detected in a small fraction (9.5%) of the psychrotolerant isolates. One psychrotolerant isolate Bw2-1 was identified as B. weihenstephanensis, but no clear distinguishing characteristics between B. weihenstephanensis and psychrotolerant B. cereus were found. These results might be of importance for gaining further understanding of the growth properties of B. weihenstephanensis and psychrotolerant B. cereus as well as their contribution to food poisoning.",M2
20034852,"Ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetic position of a novel phagotrophic stramenopile from low oxygen environments: Rictus lutensis gen. et sp. nov. (Bicosoecida, incertae sedis).A novel free free-living phagotrophic flagellate, Rictus lutensis gen. et sp. nov., with two heterodynamic flagella, a permanent cytostome and a cytopharynx was isolated from muddy, low oxygen coastal sediments in Cape Cod, MA, USA. We cultivated and characterized this flagellate with transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and molecular phylogenetic analyses inferred from small subunit (SSU) <e>rDNA</e> sequences. These data demonstrated that this organism has the key ultrastructural characters of the Bicosoecida, including similar transitional zones and a similar overall flagellar apparatus consisting of an x fiber and an L-shape microtubular root 2 involved in food capture. Although the molecular phylogenetic analyses were concordant with the ultrastructural data in placing R. lutensis with the bicosoecid clade, the internal position of this relatively divergent sequence within the clade was not resolved. Therefore, we interpret R. lutensis gen. et sp. nov. as a novel bicosoecid incertae sedis.",M2
20034851,"Patterns of genetic diversity in the marine heterotrophic flagellate Oxyrrhis marina (Alveolata: Dinophyceae).Oxyrrhis marina is an important model in ecological studies of free-living protists. Despite this, O. marina has rarely been studied in the environment and no explicit distributional studies exist. Further, phylogenetic data for a small number of isolates indicate that O. marina constitutes two divergent lineages. Here, we quantify phylogenetic variation between 58 globally distributed O. marina isolates using 5.8S--internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 <e>rDNA</e> (5.8S ITS) and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) partial sequences. 5.8S ITS and COI phylogenies both partitioned O. marina into four clades, which formed two lineages; mean sequence identity for 5.8S ITS and COI respectively was approximately 40 and 90% between these two lineages. Sequence identities for 5.8S ITS/ COI between clades within lineages were 66.3/99.4% (lineage 1: clade 1 vs 2) and 42.3/99.1% (lineage 2: clade 3 vs 4). rDNA mutation rates in O. marina appear to be abnormally high and were not interpreted in a species delineation context. Based on variation in COI sequence and comparisons with other protists, we suggest that O. marina lineages may constitute two species. In a geographic context, evidence of spatial restriction but also extensive overlap between O. marina clades occurred. Further, clade abundances varied considerably: clades 1 and 2 (belonging to one lineage) were abundant and widespread; in contrast, clades 3 and 4 (belonging to the second lineage) were rare and spatially restricted (occurring only in the Mediterranean or in culture collection). There is need for further phylogenetic and taxonomic studies to assess species delineation in O. marina, and for the application of high resolution genetic markers to resolve processes driving genetic diversity in this important model organism.",M2
20033210,"A chromosome study and localization of 18S <e>rDNA</e> in Khawia saurogobii (Cestoda: Caryophyllidea).This paper reports results of the first cytogenetic study carried out on a recently described monozoic tapeworm, Khawia saurogobii Xi et al., 2009, from the Chinese lizard gudgeon (Saurogobio dabryi). The karyotype of this species is composed of eight pairs of metacentric and telocentric chromosomes (2n = 16; n = 3m + 5t), metacentric chromosomes representing the first, sixth, and eight pairs. All chromosomes except the largest pair displayed 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylidole (DAPI) positive heterochromatin in centromeric regions. In mitotic preparations stained with Giemsa, one of the homologues of a smaller metacentric chromosome pair (No. 7) showed a distinct secondary constriction, whereas the other did not. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) probe revealed that the chromosomes No. 7 carry each a cluster of ribosomal genes associated with the centromeric heterochromatin and confirmed that this chromosome pair contains a nucleolar organizer region (NOR). The rDNA-FISH also confirmed heteromorphism in the size of NOR (i.e., secondary constriction) observed after Giemsa staining. The present cytogenetic analysis revealed species-specific characters of K. saurogobii and showed that FISH may represent a new valuable cytogenetic tool suitable for comparative taxonomic or phylogenetic studies within the order Caryophyllidea in the future.",M2
20026667,"Structure and epigenetics of nucleoli in comparison with non-nucleolar compartments.The nucleolus is a nuclear compartment that plays an important role in ribosome biogenesis. Some structural features and epigenetic patterns are shared between nucleolar and non-nucleolar compartments. For example, the location of transcriptionally active mRNA on extended chromatin loop species is similar to that observed for transcriptionally active ribosomal DNA (<e>rDNA</e>) genes on so-called Christmas tree branches. Similarly, nucleolus organizer region-bearing chromosomes located a distance from the nucleolus extend chromatin fibers into the nucleolar compartment. Specific epigenetic events, such as histone acetylation and methylation and DNA methylation, also regulate transcription of both rRNA- and mRNA-encoding loci. Here, we review the epigenetic mechanisms and structural features that regulate transcription of ribosomal and mRNA genes. We focus on similarities in epigenetic and structural regulation of chromatin in nucleoli and the surrounding non-nucleolar region and discuss the role of proteins, such as heterochromatin protein 1, fibrillarin, nucleolin, and upstream binding factor, in rRNA synthesis and processing.",M2

(Bicosoecida), and Nanos amicus gen. et sp. nov. (Bicosoecida)--were isolated from acidic peat bogs. The biflagellate A. lindahlii forms loose irregular colonies from which swimming cells may detach, and produces extensive mucilaginous material containing bacterial cells. Phylogenetic analyses of small subunit rDNA sequences demonstrated that A. lindahlii branches within the Chrysophyceae. While A. lindahlii is an obligate heterotroph, ultrastructural observations revealed a leukoplast in the perinuclear region. The pico-sized uniflagellates F. agilis and N. amicus were isolated from separate lakes and within the mucilage of A. lindahlii, suggesting their close associations in natural habitats. In SSU rDNA phylogenies, F. agilis and N. amicus were closely related to the bicosoecids Adriamonas, Siluania, Paramonas, and Nerada. While Filos, Nanos, and Siluania are similar in light microscopic features, their SSU rDNA gene sequences differed significantly (&gt;8% differences) and were not monophyletic. Both F. agilis and N. amicus have a cytostome/cytopharynx particle ingestion apparatus.

The nature of association between A. lindahlii and its epibiontic bicosoecids is discussed.",M2
20016909,"B chromosome ancestry revealed by histone genes in the migratory locust.In addition to the standard set of chromosomes (A), about 15% of eukaryote genomes carry B chromosomes. In most cases, B chromosomes behave as genomic parasites being detrimental for the individuals carrying them and prospering in natural populations because of transmission advantages (drive). B chromosomes are mostly made up of repetitive DNA sequences, especially ribosomal DNA (<e>rDNA</e>), satellite DNA and mobile elements. In only two cases have B chromosomes been shown to carry protein-coding genes. Although some B chromosomes seem to have derived from interspecific hybridisation, the most likely source of B chromosomes is the host genome itself, but the specific A chromosome being the B ancestor has not been identified in any B-containing species. Here, we provide strong evidence for B chromosome ancestry in the migratory locust, based on the location of genes for the H3 and H4 histones in the B chromosome and a single A chromosome pair (i.e. the eighth in order of decreasing size). The high DNA sequence similarity of A and B chromosome H3-H4 genes supports B-origin from chromosome 8. The higher variation shown by B sequences, compared to A sequences, suggests that B chromosome sequences are most likely inactive and thus less subjected to purifying selection. Estimates of time of divergence for histone genes from A and B chromosomes suggest that B chromosomes are quite old (&gt;750,000 years), showing the B-chromosome ability to persist in natural populations for long periods of time.",M2

20015388,"One nutritional symbiosis begat another: phylogenetic evidence that the ant tribe Camponotini acquired Blochmannia by tending sap-feeding insects.BACKGROUND: Bacterial endosymbiosis has a recurring significance in the evolution of insects. An estimated 10-20% of insect species depend on bacterial associates for their nutrition and reproductive viability. Members of the ant tribe Camponotini, the focus of this study, possess a stable, intracellular bacterial mutualist. The bacterium, Blochmannia, was first discovered in Camponotus and has since been documented in a distinct subgenus of Camponotus, Colobopsis, and in the related genus Polyrhachis. However, the distribution of Blochmannia throughout the Camponotini remains in question. Documenting the true host range of this bacterial mutualist is an important first step toward understanding the various ecological contexts in which it has evolved, and toward identifying its closest bacterial relatives. In this study, we performed a molecular screen, based on PCR amplification of 16S <e>rDNA</e>, to identify bacterial associates of diverse Camponotini species. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA gave four important insights: (i) Blochmannia occurs in a broad range of Camponotini genera including Calomyrmex, Echinopla, and Opisthopsis, and did not occur in outgroups related to this tribe (e.g., Notostigma). This suggests that the mutualism originated in the ancestor of the tribe Camponotini. (ii) The known bacteriocyte-associated symbionts of ants, in Formica, Plagiolepis, and the Camponotini, arose independently. (iii) Blochmannia is nestled within a diverse clade of endosymbionts of sap-feeding hemipteran insects, such as mealybugs, aphids, and psyllids. In our analyses, a group of secondary symbionts of mealybugs are the closest relatives of Blochmannia. (iv) Blochmannia has cospeciated with its known hosts, although deep divergences at the genus level remain uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: The Blochmannia mutualism occurs in Calomyrmex, Echinopla, and Opisthopsis, in addition to Camponotus, and probably originated in the ancestral lineage leading to the Camponotini. This significant expansion of its known host range implies that the mutualism is more ancient and ecologically diverse than previously documented. Blochmannia is most closely related to endosymbionts of sap-feeding hemipterans, which ants tend for their carbohydrate-rich honeydew. Based on phylogenetic results, we propose Camponotini might have originally acquired this bacterial mutualist through a nutritional symbiosis with other insects.",M2

19995612,"Out of Antarctica?--new insights into the phylogeny and biogeography of the Pleurobranchomorpha (Mollusca, Gastropoda).The aim of the current study was to gain new insights into the phylogeny, biogeography and evolution of the opisthobranch clade Pleurobranchomorpha. We focused on testing the hypothesis of an Antarctic origin of this clade. The combination of four gene markers (18S <e>rDNA</e>, 28S rDNA, 16S rDNA and CO1) was used to infer a phylogenetic hypothesis of the Pleurobranchomorpha employing Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. Four methodologically distinct approaches were applied to reconstruct the historical biogeography and dating of the tree was performed via relaxed molecular clock analysis. Phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of the Pleurobranchomorpha and their sister group relationship to the Nudibranchia. Monophyly of the main subgroups Pleurobranchaeinae and Pleurobranchinae could not be revealed. Reconstruction of the ancestral area of the Pleurobranchomorpha yielded different possibilities in the diverse analyses. However, the Pleurobranchinae most probably derived from an Antarctic origin. Estimation of divergence times revealed a long credible interval for the Pleurobranchomorpha, whereas the Pleurobranchinae diverged in Early Oligocene and underwent rapid radiation during Oligocene and Early Miocene. Divergence of the Pleurobranchinae into the Antarctic Tomthompsonia and the remaining species in Early Oligocene coincides with two major geological events; namely the onset of glaciation in Antarctica and the opening of the Drake Passage with following formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). These sudden and dramatic changes in climate probably led to subsequent migration of the last common ancestor of the remaining Pleurobranchinae into warmer regions, while the ACC may have accounted for larval dispersal to the Eastern Atlantic.",M2

Five (29.4%) among 17 Acanthamoeba isolates contained endosymbionts in their cytoplasm, as demonstrated via orcein staining. In order to estimate their pathogenicity, we conducted a genetic characterization of the endosymbionts in Acanthamoeba isolated from domestic tap water via 16S <e>rDNA</e> sequencing. The endosymbionts of Acanthamoeba sp. KA/WP3 and KA/WP4 evidenced the highest level of similarity, at 97% of the recently published 16S rDNA sequence of the bacterium, Candidatus Amoebophilus asiaticus. The endosymbionts of Acanthamoeba sp. KA/WP8 and KA/WP12 shared a 97% sequence similarity with each other, and were also highly similar to Candidatus Odyssella thessalonicensis, a member of the alpha-proteobacteria. The endosymbiont of Acanthamoeba sp. KA/WP9 exhibits a high degree of similarity (85-95%) with genus Methylophilus, which is not yet known to harbor any endosymbionts. This is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, to show that Methylophilus spp. can live in the cytoplasm of Acanthamoeba.",M2
19962263,"Microbial associations in gut systems of wood- and bark-inhabiting longhorned beetles [Coleoptera: Cerambycidae].Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques and PCR-based <e>rDNA</e> sequencing, gut microflora in the larvae of bark- and wood-inhabiting cerambycid beetles (Rhagium inquisitor, Tetropium castaneum, Plagionotus arcuatus and Leptura rubra [Coleoptera: Cerambycidae]) was investigated. A total of 12 novel ascomycetous yeast strains were isolated from the gut content. Panfungal and strain-specific oligonucleotide probes identified two yeast strains as Candida rhagii and Candida shehatae, which were colonizing specialized organs (mycetomes) adhering to the gut of R. inquisitor and L. rubra larvae, respectively. Fragments containing these organisms were constantly being released from the mycetomes into the gut lumen. Whereas the mycetome symbiont of T. castaneum could not be identified, all larvae of this species harbored an additional bacterial endocytobiont in their gut epithelium. This novel gammaproteobacterium belonged to the Sodalis clade of insect symbionts, which includes the secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies (Sodalis glossinidius) and the Sitophilus oryzae primary endosymbiont (SOPE). Extracellular gut flora of the investigated cerambycid larvae was comprised of Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria. However, the individual composition among investigated larvae was highly variable and supposedly depended on individual host nutrition.",M2
19956593,"The SNF2-family member Fun30 promotes gene silencing in heterochromatic loci.Chromatin regulates many key processes in the nucleus by controlling access to the underlying DNA. SNF2-like factors are ATP-driven enzymes that play key roles in the dynamics of chromatin by remodelling nucleosomes and other nucleoprotein complexes. Even simple eukaryotes such as yeast contain members of several subfamilies of SNF2-like factors. The FUN30/ETL1 subfamily of SNF2 remodellers is conserved from yeasts to humans, but is poorly characterized. We show that the deletion of FUN30 leads to sensitivity to the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin and to severe cell cycle progression defects when the Orc5 subunit is mutated. We demonstrate a role of FUN30 in promoting silencing in the heterochromatin-like mating type locus HMR, telomeres and the <e>rDNA</e> repeats. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that Fun30 binds at the boundary element of the silent HMR and within the silent HMR. Mapping of nucleosomes in vivo using micrococcal nuclease demonstrates that deletion of FUN30 leads to changes of the chromatin structure at the boundary element. A point mutation in the ATP-binding site abrogates the silencing function of Fun30 as well as its toxicity upon overexpression, indicating that the ATPase activity is essential for these roles of Fun30. We identify by amino acid sequence analysis a putative CUE motif as a feature of FUN30/ETL1 factors and show that this motif assists Fun30 activity. Our work suggests that Fun30 is directly involved in silencing by regulating the chromatin structure within or around silent loci.",M2
20005168,"Molecular phylogeny and classification of the Mamiellophyceae class. nov. (Chlorophyta) based on sequence comparisons of the nuclear- and plastid-encoded rRNA operons.Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the Mamiellophyceae classis nova, a ubiquitous group of largely picoplanktonic green algae comprising scaly and non-scaly prasinophyte unicells, were performed using single and concatenated gene sequence comparisons of the nuclear- and plastid-encoded rRNA operons. The study resolved all major clades within the class, identified molecular signature sequences for most clades through an exhaustive search for non-homoplasious synapomorphies [Marin et al. (2003): Protist 154: 99-145] and incorporated these signatures into the diagnoses of two novel orders, Monomastigales ord nov., Dolichomastigales ord. nov., and four novel families, Monomastigaceae fam. nov., Dolichomastigaceae fam. nov., Crustomastigaceae fam. nov., and Bathycoccaceae fam. nov., within a revised classification of the class. A database search for the presence of environmental <e>rDNA</e> sequences in the Monomastigales and Dolichomastigales identified an unexpectedly large genetic diversity of Monomastigales confined to freshwater, a novel clade (Dolicho_B) in the Dolichomastigaceae from deep sea sediments and a novel freshwater clade in the Crustomastigaceae. The Mamiellophyceae represent one of the ecologically most successful groups of eukaryotic, photosynthetic picoplankters in marine and likely also freshwater environments.",M2
19996435,"Genotyping of Trypanosoma cruzi: systematic selection of assays allowing rapid and accurate discrimination of all known lineages.Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, can be subdivided into six discrete typing units (DTUs), TcI, TcIIa, TcIIb, TcIIc, TcIId or TcIIe, each having distinct epidemiologically important features. Dozens of genetic markers are available to determine the DTU to which a T. cruzi isolate belongs, but there is no consensus on which should be used. We selected five assays: three polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphisms based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HSP60, Histone H1, and GPI loci, and PCR product size polymorphism of the LSU <e>rDNA</e> and mini-exon loci. Each assay was tested for its capacity to differentiate between DTUs using a panel of 48 genetically diverse T. cruzi clones. Some markers allowed unequivocal identification of individual DTUs, however, only by using a combination of multiple markers could all six DTUs be resolved. Based upon the results we recommend a triple-assay comprising the LSU rDNA, HSP60 and GPI markers for reliable, rapid, low-cost DTU assignment.",M2
