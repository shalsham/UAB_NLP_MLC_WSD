16380426,"Enhancer-independent Mu transposition from two topologically distinct synapses.Transposition of Mu is strictly dependent on a specific orientation of the left (L) and right (R) ends of Mu and a distant enhancer site (E) located on supercoiled DNA. Five DNA crossings are trapped in the three-site synapse, two of which are contributed by the interwrapping of L and R. To determine the contribution of E to the interwrapping of Mu ends, we examined the topology of the LR synapse under two different enhancer-independent reaction conditions. One of these conditions, which also alleviates the requirement for a specific orientation of Mu ends, revealed two topologically distinct arrangements of the ends. In their normal relative orientation, L and R were either plectonemically interwrapped or aligned by random collision. Addition of the enhancer to this system channeled <e>synapsis</e> toward the interwrapped pathway. When the ends were in the wrong relative orientation, synapsis occurred exclusively by random collision. In the second enhancer-independent condition, which retains the requirement for a specific orientation of Mu ends, synapsis of L and R was entirely by interwrapping. The two distinct kinds of synapses also were identified by gel electrophoresis. We discuss these results in the context of the  topological filter  model and consider the many contributions the enhancer makes to the biologically relevant interwrapped synapse.",M1
16045469,"The Arabidopsis ROCK-N-ROLLERS gene encodes a homolog of the yeast ATP-dependent DNA helicase MER3 and is required for normal meiotic crossover formation.Recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have unveiled that meiotic recombination crossovers are formed by two genetically distinct pathways: a major interference-sensitive pathway and a minor interference-insensitive pathway. Several proteins, including the MSH4/MSH5 heterodimer and the MER3 DNA helicase, are indispensable for the interference-sensitive pathway. MSH4 homologs have been identified in mice and Arabidopsis and shown to be required for normal levels of crossovers, suggesting that the function of MSH4 may be conserved among major eukaryotic kingdoms. However, it is not known whether an MER3-like function is also required for meiosis in animals and plants. We have identified an Arabidopsis gene that encodes a putative MER3 homolog and is preferentially expressed in meiocytes. T-DNA insertional mutants of this gene exhibit defects in fertility and meiosis. Detailed cytological studies indicate that the mutants are defective in homolog <e>synapsis</e> and crossover formation, resulting in a reduction of bivalents and in the formation of univalents at late prophase I. We have named this gene ROCK-N-ROLLERS (RCK) to reflect the mutant phenotype of chromosomes undergoing the meiotic 'dance' either in pairs or individually. Our results demonstrate that an MER3-like function is required for meiotic crossover in plants and provide further support for the idea that Arabidopsis, like the budding yeast, possesses both interference-sensitive and insensitive pathways for crossover formation.",M1
15207421,"alpha-1-Antichymotrypsin polymorphism in the gene promoter region affects survival and <e>synapsis</e> loss in Alzheimer's disease.One-hundred-thirty-tree patients with neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD) were genotyped for the polymorphic regions in the apolipoprotein Eepsilon (APOE)and a new polymorphism in the promoter region of the alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) gene. The ACT TT genotype was associated with a longer survival of AD patients, and among patients with the APOE epsilon4 allele, this genotype increased the duration of the disease. The ACT TT genotype was also associated with a late age at onset of the disease and a delayed age at death in patients without the APOE epsilon4 allele. This latter group of patients also showed increased levels of synaptophysin from the mid-frontal (MF) cortex area. ACT appears to play complex, multiple roles on AD and to affect synaptic plasticity in the AD brain of patients without the allele APOE epsilon4 allele.",M1
11550884,"The synaptic behaviour of the wild forms of Triticum turgidum and T. timopheevii.Different wild allopolyploid species of Triticeae show extensive bivalent formation at zygotene while a considerable number of multivalents is present in cultivated polyploid wheats. To study the chromosome behaviour at early meiotic stages in wild forms of tetraploid wheats Triticum turgidum and T timopheevii (2n = 4x = 28) we have analysed the synaptic pattern in fully traced spread nuclei at mid- and late zygotene and at pachytene of wild accessions of these species. The mean number of synaptonemal complex (SC) bivalents at mid-zygotene ranged from 12.22 to 13.14 among the accessions studied indicating a strong restriction of <e>synapsis</e> initiation to homologous chromosomes. The mean of bivalents increased at pachytene because of the transformation of multivalents into bivalents. Ring bivalents observed at metaphase I support that SC bivalents were formed by homologous chromosomes. The average values of SC bivalents at mid-zygotene in the wild forms are much higher than the average values observed in the cultivated tetraploid wheats but similar to that of a mutant line of T turgidum with a duplication that includes Ph1, the major homoeologous pairing suppressor locus. These results suggest that the efficiency of the mechanism operating in the homologous recognition for synapsis is higher in wild wheat populations than in cultivated varieties. Apparently, a relatively detrimental modification of the pairing regulating genetic system accompanied the domestication of the wild wheat forms.",M1
11463847,"A meiotic chromosomal core consisting of cohesin complex proteins recruits DNA recombination proteins and promotes <e>synapsis</e> in the absence of an axial element in mammalian meiotic cells.The behavior of meiotic chromosomes differs in several respects from that of their mitotic counterparts, resulting in the generation of genetically distinct haploid cells. This has been attributed in part to a meiosis-specific chromatin-associated protein structure, the synaptonemal complex. This complex consist of two parallel axial elements, each one associated with a pair of sister chromatids, and a transverse filament located between the synapsed homologous chromosomes. Recently, a different protein structure, the cohesin complex, was shown to be associated with meiotic chromosomes and to be required for chromosome segregation. To explore the functions of the two different protein structures, the synaptonemal complex and the cohesin complex, in mammalian male meiotic cells, we have analyzed how absence of the axial element affects early meiotic chromosome behavior. We find that the synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3) is a main determinant of axial-element assembly and is required for attachment of this structure to meiotic chromosomes, whereas SCP2 helps shape the in vivo structure of the axial element. We also show that formation of a cohesin-containing chromosomal core in meiotic nuclei does not require SCP3 or SCP2. Our results also suggest that the cohesin core recruits recombination proteins and promotes synapsis between homologous chromosomes in the absence of an axial element. A model for early meiotic chromosome pairing and synapsis is proposed.",M1
9810487,"The synaptic process in Locusta migratoria spermatocytes by synaptonemal complex analysis.We describe the synaptic process during meiotic prophase in spermatocytes from Locusta migratoria, using synaptonemal complex (SC) spreads analyzed by light (LM) and electron (EM) microscopy. At leptotene, a stage of short duration, unpaired axial elements begin to be assembled. <e>Synapsis</e> starts at zygotene, beginning usually at the terminal regions of the bivalents, either at the proximal, centromeric end or at the distal, non-centromeric end; interstitial initiation of synapsis was only occasionally observed in the longer chromosomes. Pairing is asynchronous, and shorter chromosomes are the first to complete synapsis. At pachytene all bivalents are fully synapsed. Diplotene is characterized by the progressive fragmentation of SCs; fragmentation is asynchronous, and affects mainly the longer chromosomes, while the shorter ones maintain their morphology up to late diplotene.",M1
9364610,"The brain as a symbol-processing machine.The knowledge accumulated about the biochemistry of the <e>synapsis</e> in the last decades completely changes the notion of brain processing founded exclusively over an electrical mechanism, toward that supported by a complex chemical message exchange occurring both locally, at the synaptic site, as well as at other localities, depending on the solubility of the involved chemical substances in the extracellular compartment. These biochemical transactions support a rich symbolic processing of the information both encoded by the genes and provided by actual data collected from the surrounding environment, by means of either special molecular or cellular receptor systems. In this processing, molecules play the role of symbols and chemical affinity shared by them specifies the syntax for symbol manipulation in order to process and to produce chemical messages. In this context, neurons are conceived as message-exchanging agents. Chemical strings are produced and stored at defined places, and ionic currents are used to speed up message delivery. Synaptic transactions can no longer be assumed to correspond to a simple process of propagating numbers powered by a factor measuring the presynaptic capacity to influence the postsynaptic electrical activity, but they must be modeled by more powerful formal tools supporting both numerical and symbolic calculations. It is proposed here that formal language theory is the adequate mathematical tool to handle such symbolic processing. The purpose of the present review is therefore: (a) to discuss the relevant and recent literature about trophic factors, signal transduction mechanisms, neuromodulators and neurotransmitters in order (b) to point out the common features of these correlated processes; and (c) to show how they may be organized into a formal model supported by the theory of fuzzy formal languages (d) to model the brain as a distributed intelligent problem solver.",M1
7557357,"On the mechanism of homologous <e>synapsis</e> in lycosid spiders.Lycosid spiders have 13 pairs of telocentric chromosomes and 2 nonhomologous sex chromosomes in males. At leptotene, the kinetochore ends are attached to the nuclear envelope via thickened attachment plaques. Homologous synapsis begins at the attachment plaques and proceeds zipper-like through the length of the synaptonemal complex. We have tested whether or not this simple form of homologous synapsis is obligatory by inducing reciprocal translocations. Since we find many irradiated cells with quadrivalents at diakinesis-prometaphase and metaphase I, clearly a backup system exists that can bring together homologous segments disparate from each other in the nucleus. This mechanism apparently does not depend on end-initiated synapsis. Furthermore, we have found in previous studies that wolf spider bivalents are always unichiasmate, with either proximally or distally placed chiasmata. Since many chain quadrivalents, but no ring quadrivalents, were seen in this study, crossing over and chiasma placement obey a different set of rules when homologous segments are switched between chromosomes.",M1

Mathematical modeling]In the case of somatic inhibition the maximum efficiency of inhibition is observed when exciting inputs are situated distal of the long dendrite. For fibres of a medium length simultaneous inhibition in the soma and the distal end is more efficient. Excitant <e>synapsis</e> near the soma produce the best inhibition only at some fixed distance. This effect can explain the morphological fact of rarefaction of synaptic contacts near soma.",M1
7884642," In vitro  effects of methyl-mercury on the nervous system: a neurotoxicologic study.Many of the currently prevailing toxicologic problems are due to the use of organic mercurial compounds in pesticides and fungicides. During recent years, environmental pollution has originated from the incorrect use of these organometals. Methyl-mercury (Me-Hg) is absorbed quickly from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed to most tissues. The most important effect of Me-Hg is on the nervous tissue and is more relevant in the fetal brain. We were interested in assessing the neurotoxic effects of Me-Hg on the central and peripheral nervous system. Neuronal cells cultures from 14-day-old fetal Wistar rats and ciliary ganglion cells cultures from 8-day-old chick embryos were used. Various Me-Hg concentrations (10(-3) M to 10(-8) M) were added to these cultures after 36 hr to study the morphologic changes. At 10(-3) M and 10(-4) M concentrations, cellular degeneration and death in the central nervous system (CNS) were noted. At 10(-5) M concentrations, axonal and nerve fibers degeneration, loss of <e>synapsis</e>, and inhibition in the cellular development in CNS were seen; regroupment and destruction in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) was noted. Finally, at 10(-6) M and 10(-7) M concentrations, there were hardly any modifications in the CNS, whereas only the nervous processes were affected in the PNS.",M1

A great variety of synaptic configurations with complicated combinations of homologously and non-homologously paired segments was observed. Analysis of these configurations revealed at least five independent pairing regions in chromosome 1. Interrelationships between these regions with respect to their pairing ability were estimated. Pairings in the distal non-inverted segment and in inversions inhibit each other, while pairing in either inverted segment facilitates <e>synapsis</e> in the other.

2349442,"[Does the plasticity of central nervous system synapses have a morphological basis?]The sensorymotor area of the cerebral cortex of the laboratory rat was repeatedly electrically stimulated after 10-minute intervals which led to progressive lengthening of the self-sustained after-discharges (SSAD). One minute, 10 minutes and one hour after completion of the third SSAD the authors examined by an electron microscope synapses type I according to Gray from the IInd cortical layer of the sensorymotor area of the contralateral hemisphere. One minute after termination of the fit a marked drop of the number of granular synaptic vesicles was noted in the immediate vicinity of the synaptic cleft, as well as in the whole <e>synapsis</e>, which correlates very closely with the reduced excitability of tissue during this period. Ten minutes after the end of the fit the number of vesicles rises markedly in both evaluated areas. This finding again corresponds well to the functional state, i.e. an increased excitability. One hour after the end of SSAD no changes in the number of vesicles near the synaptic cleft was found which might be associated with a greater functional capacity of the synaptic apparatuses. The results confirmed the idea on the synaptic apparatus as a structure which reflects from the morphological aspect very accurately changes of the functional state of the central nervous system.",M1
3103859,"TRH axon terminals in <e>synapsis</e> with GRF neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the rat hypothalamus as revealed by double labeling immunocytochemistry.Synaptic input to neurons containing growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) by axon terminals containing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the arcuate nucleus (AN) of the rat hypothalamus was examined using a method combining pre-embedding peroxidase-anti-peroxidase for GRF with postembedding immunocolloidal gold staining for TRH. The TRH-like immunoreactive axon terminals were found to make synaptic contact with GRF-like immunoreactive neurons with unlabeled axon terminals. From these findings, TRH-containing neurons in the hypothalamic AN of the rat may be considered to innervate GRF neurons, to regulate GRF secretion or to have some other functions via synapses.",M1
3622248,"Ultrastructural aspects of ageing rat hippocampus and effects of L-acetyl-carnitine treatment.The ageing rat hippocampus undergoes ultrastructural changes, including the loss of axosomatic synapses of the granule cells. These synapses are supposed to take part in a feed-back regulation of granule cell activity, as they are inhibitory terminals of interneurons which receive afferences from the granules themselves via the giant synapses formed by the collaterals of the mossy fibres. In the present study the authors performed a quantitative analysis of axosomatic and giant synapses at the ultrastructural level in aged rats as compared with young animals. In aged rats a decrease both in axosomatic synapses and in giant <e>synapsis</e> vesicles was found, giving further support to the postulated feed-back mechanism. Both young and old rats were treated with L-acetyl-carnitine, a drug which favours the synthesis of acetylcholine, the main neurotransmitter deficient in old age. In aged rats the drug restored a normal number of both axosomatic synapses and giant bouton vesicles. The authors hypothesize that the drug, by a cholinergic-type mechanism, restores the excitatory afferences to the granule whose axon would thus form normal giant boutons with the interneuron, reestablishing the feed-back regulation. In young rats the drug induced a decrease only of the axosomatic synapses, suggesting that an  over-excitation  might impair the information to the local-circuit neurons, thus interrupting feed-back control.",M1

A number of the nerve fibres take place in Schwann's cells wrapped in a mesaxon membrane. The larger part, surrounds the round cell-nests consisting of chemoreceptor cells with a close-meshed network.

20308424,"Mammalian BLM helicase is critical for integrating multiple pathways of meiotic recombination.Bloom's syndrome (BS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth retardation, cancer predisposition, and sterility. BS mutated (Blm), the gene mutated in BS patients, is one of five mammalian RecQ helicases. Although BLM has been shown to promote genome stability by assisting in the repair of DNA structures that arise during homologous recombination in somatic cells, less is known about its role in meiotic recombination primarily because of the embryonic lethality associated with Blm deletion. However, the localization of BLM protein on meiotic chromosomes together with evidence from yeast and other organisms implicates a role for BLM helicase in meiotic recombination events, prompting us to explore the meiotic phenotype of mice bearing a conditional mutant allele of Blm. In this study, we show that BLM deficiency does not affect entry into prophase I but causes severe defects in meiotic progression. This is exemplified by improper pairing and <e>synapsis</e> of homologous chromosomes and altered processing of recombination intermediates, resulting in increased chiasmata. Our data provide the first analysis of BLM function in mammalian meiosis and strongly argue that BLM is involved in proper pairing, synapsis, and segregation of homologous chromosomes; however, it is dispensable for the accumulation of recombination intermediates.",M2
20019666,"DNA polymerase beta is critical for mouse meiotic <e>synapsis</e>.We have shown earlier that DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta) localizes to the synaptonemal complex (SC) during Prophase I of meiosis in mice. Pol beta localizes to synapsed axes during zygonema and pachynema, and it associates with the ends of bivalents during late pachynema and diplonema. To test whether these localization patterns reflect a function for Pol beta in recombination and/or synapsis, we used conditional gene targeting to delete the PolB gene from germ cells. We find that Pol beta-deficient spermatocytes are defective in meiotic chromosome synapsis and undergo apoptosis during Prophase I. We also find that SPO11-dependent gammaH2AX persists on meiotic chromatin, indicating that Pol beta is critical for the repair of SPO11-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs). Pol beta-deficient spermatocytes yielded reduced steady-state levels of the SPO11-oligonucleotide complexes that are formed when SPO11 is removed from the ends of DSBs, and cytological experiments revealed that chromosome-associated foci of replication protein A (RPA), RAD51 and DMC1 are less abundant in Pol beta-deficient spermatocyte nuclei. Localization of Pol beta to meiotic chromosomes requires the formation of SPO11-dependent DSBs. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate that Pol beta is required at a very early step in the processing of meiotic DSBs, at or before the removal of SPO11 from DSB ends and the generation of the 3' single-stranded tails necessary for subsequent strand exchange. The chromosome synapsis defects and Prophase I apoptosis of Pol beta-deficient spermatocytes are likely a direct consequence of these recombination defects.",M2
19959993,"Yeast axial-element protein, Red1, binds SUMO chains to promote meiotic interhomologue recombination and chromosome <e>synapsis</e>.The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a tripartite protein structure consisting of two parallel axial elements (AEs) and a central region. During meiosis, the SC connects paired homologous chromosomes, promoting interhomologue (IH) recombination. Here, we report that, like the CE component Zip1, Saccharomyces cerevisiae axial-element structural protein, Red1, can bind small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) polymeric chains. The Red1-SUMO chain interaction is dispensable for the initiation of meiotic DNA recombination, but it is essential for Tel1- and Mec1-dependent Hop1 phosphorylation, which ensures IH recombination by preventing the inter-sister chromatid DNA repair pathway. Our results also indicate that Red1 and Zip1 may directly sandwich the SUMO chains to mediate SC assembly. We suggest that Red1 and SUMO chains function together to couple homologous recombination and Mec1-Tel1 kinase activation with chromosome synapsis during yeast meiosis.",M2

19913287,"Cytoskeletal forces span the nuclear envelope to coordinate meiotic chromosome pairing and <e>synapsis</e>.During meiosis, each chromosome must pair with its unique homologous partner, a process that usually culminates with the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, special regions on each chromosome known as pairing centers are essential for both homologous pairing and synapsis. We report that during early meiosis, pairing centers establish transient connections to the cytoplasmic microtubule network. These connections through the intact nuclear envelope require the SUN/KASH domain protein pair SUN-1 and ZYG-12. Disruption of microtubules inhibits chromosome pairing, indicating that these connections promote interhomolog interactions. Dynein activity is essential to license formation of the SC once pairing has been accomplished, most likely by overcoming a barrier imposed by the chromosome-nuclear envelope connection. Our findings thus provide insight into how homolog pairing is accomplished in meiosis and into the mechanisms regulating synapsis so that it occurs selectively between homologs.

19913286,"Meiotic chromosome homology search involves modifications of the nuclear envelope protein Matefin/SUN-1.Genome haploidization during meiosis depends on recognition and association of parental homologous chromosomes. The C. elegans SUN/KASH domain proteins Matefin/SUN-1 and ZYG-12 have a conserved role in this process. They bridge the nuclear envelope, connecting the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm to transmit forces that allow chromosome movement and homolog pairing and prevent nonhomologous <e>synapsis</e>. Here, we show that Matefin/SUN-1 forms rapidly moving aggregates at putative chromosomal attachment sites in the meiotic transition zone (TZ). We analyzed requirements for aggregate formation and identified multiple phosphotarget residues in the nucleoplasmic domain of Matefin/SUN-1. These CHK-2 dependent phosphorylations occur in leptotene/zygotene, diminish during pachytene and are involved in pairing. Mimicking phosphorylation causes an extended TZ and univalents at diakinesis. Our data suggest that the properties of the nuclear envelope are altered during the time window when homologs are sorted and Matefin/SUN-1 aggregates form, thereby controling the movement, homologous pairing and interhomolog recombination of chromosomes.",M2
19837073,"Meiotic chromosome pairing and bouquet formation during Eimeria tenella sporulation.In Eimeria tenella, meiotic division occurs exclusively in oocysts within the first 8h of sporulation. Difficulties with the wall-oocyst breakage in gaining access to chromosomes during meiosis have resulted in a scarcity of morphological data on Eimeria chromosomes. This study tracks the general behaviour of telomeres, attachment plaques and synaptonemal complexes in the nucleus of the meiotic oocyst of E. tenella. Fluorescence microscopy methods, in combination with immunoelectron microscopy techniques, were applied to obtain a series of time-lapse images during oocyst sporulation. Antibodies to Structural Maintenance of Chromosome proteins SMC1 and SMC3, and lamin were labelled with either fluorescence or colloidal gold to visualise the telomeres, central elements of the synaptonemal complex (SC) and nuclear periphery, respectively, at both the structural and ultrastructural levels. Using oocyst spreads and ultrathin sections of fixed oocysts it was possible to study telomere dynamics at stages during meiosis. The stages of the meiotic prophase I are delineated on the basis of the telomere position and the SC <e>synapsis</e> and desynapsis. During the leptotene stage, at 4h following the start of sporulation, meiotic chromosomes attached to the nuclear envelope. At that stage, chromosome synapsis was initiated in the telomeric regions but no interstitial synapsis pairing was observed. In the zygotene stage, telomere signals were clustered in a limited area of the nuclear envelope. Bouquet formation occurred at 5h after the start of sporulation, whereas chromosomes did not appear completely synapsed until the pachytene stage at 6h of sporulation. Desynapsis was observed at 8h of sporulation during the diplotene stage. This study provides the first morphological description of both the behaviour of the chromosomes and the timing of the prophase I stages in the meiotic nucleus of E. tenella.",M2
19765989,"Fpr3 and Zip3 ensure that initiation of meiotic recombination precedes chromosome <e>synapsis</e> in budding yeast.BACKGROUND: Homolog pairing, synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly (chromosome synapsis), and crossover recombination are essential for successful meiotic chromosome segregation. A distinguishing feature of meiosis in budding yeast and mammals is that synapsis between homologs depends upon recombination; however, the molecular basis for this contingency is not understood. RESULTS: We show here that the yeast proline isomerase Fpr3 and the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) ligase Zip3 ensure that SC assembly is dependent upon recombination initiation. When Fpr3 and Zip3 are absent, synapsis occurs even in a mutant that fails to initiate recombination and homolog pairing. Fpr3 and Zip3 appear to specifically prevent synapsis initiation at centromeric sites. This result is consistent with previous observations of SC proteins localizing to centromeres prior to and independent of meiotic recombination initiation. Finally, we show that without Fpr3 and Zip3 activities, the synapsis initiation components Zip2 and Zip4 are dispensable for chromosome synapsis. CONCLUSIONS: Fpr3 and Zip3 represent parallel pathways that function in a checkpoint-like manner to ensure that chromosome synapsis is contingent on the initiation of recombination. We propose that, during normal meiosis, Zip2 and Zip4 act downstream of recombination signals to oppose Fpr3- and Zip3-mediated inhibitions to initiating SC assembly at centromeres. These data suggest a role for centromeres in coordinating major meiotic chromosomal events and draw an interesting parallel between yeast centromeres and C. elegans pairing centers.",M2
19763177,"A high throughput genetic screen identifies new early meiotic recombination functions in Arabidopsis thaliana.Meiotic recombination is initiated by the formation of numerous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalysed by the widely conserved Spo11 protein. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Spo11 requires nine other proteins for meiotic DSB formation; however, unlike Spo11, few of these are conserved across kingdoms. In order to investigate this recombination step in higher eukaryotes, we took advantage of a high-throughput meiotic mutant screen carried out in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A collection of 55,000 mutant lines was screened, and spo11-like mutations, characterised by a drastic decrease in chiasma formation at metaphase I associated with an absence of <e>synapsis</e> at prophase, were selected. This screen led to the identification of two populations of mutants classified according to their recombination defects: mutants that repair meiotic DSBs using the sister chromatid such as Atdmc1 or mutants that are unable to make DSBs like Atspo11-1. We found that in Arabidopsis thaliana at least four proteins are necessary for driving meiotic DSB repair via the homologous chromosomes. These include the previously characterised DMC1 and the Hop1-related ASY1 proteins, but also the meiotic specific cyclin SDS as well as the Hop2 Arabidopsis homologue AHP2. Analysing the mutants defective in DSB formation, we identified the previously characterised AtSPO11-1, AtSPO11-2, and AtPRD1 as well as two new genes, AtPRD2 and AtPRD3. Our data thus increase the number of proteins necessary for DSB formation in Arabidopsis thaliana to five. Unlike SPO11 and (to a minor extent) PRD1, these two new proteins are poorly conserved among species, suggesting that the DSB formation mechanism, but not its regulation, is conserved among eukaryotes.",M2
19752214,"Interlock formation and coiling of meiotic chromosome axes during <e>synapsis</e>.The meiotic prophase chromosome has a unique architecture. At the onset of leptotene, the replicated sister chromatids are organized along an axial element. During zygotene, as homologous chromosomes pair and synapse, a synaptonemal complex forms via the assembly of a transverse element between the two axial elements. However, due to the limitations of light and electron microscopy, little is known about chromatin organization with respect to the chromosome axes and about the spatial progression of synapsis in three dimensions. Three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) is a new method of superresolution optical microscopy that overcomes the 200-nm diffraction limit of conventional light microscopy and reaches a lateral resolution of at least 100 nm. Using 3D-SIM and antibodies against a cohesin protein (AFD1/REC8), we resolved clearly the two axes that form the lateral elements of the synaptonemal complex. The axes are coiled around each other as a left-handed helix, and AFD1 showed a bilaterally symmetrical pattern on the paired axes. Using the immunostaining of the axial element component (ASY1/HOP1) to find unsynapsed regions, entangled chromosomes can be easily detected. At the late zygotene/early pachytene transition, about one-third of the nuclei retained unsynapsed regions and 78% of these unsynapsed axes were associated with interlocks. By late pachytene, no interlocks remain, suggesting that interlock resolution may be an important and rate-limiting step to complete synapsis. Since interlocks are potentially deleterious if left unresolved, possible mechanisms for their resolution are discussed in this article.",M2
19736318,"Pds5 is required for homologue pairing and inhibits <e>synapsis</e> of sister chromatids during yeast meiosis.During meiosis, homologues become juxtaposed and synapsed along their entire length. Mutations in the cohesin complex disrupt not only sister chromatid cohesion but also homologue pairing and synaptonemal complex formation. In this study, we report that Pds5, a cohesin-associated protein known to regulate sister chromatid cohesion, is required for homologue pairing and synapsis in budding yeast. Pds5 colocalizes with cohesin along the length of meiotic chromosomes. In the absence of Pds5, the meiotic cohesin subunit Rec8 remains bound to chromosomes with only minor defects in sister chromatid cohesion, but sister chromatids synapse instead of homologues. Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed but are not repaired efficiently. In addition, meiotic chromosomes undergo hypercondensation. When the mitotic cohesin subunit Mcd1 is substituted for Rec8 in Pds5-depleted cells, chromosomes still hypercondense, but synapsis of sister chromatids is abolished. These data suggest that Pds5 modulates the Rec8 activity to facilitate chromosome morphological changes required for homologue synapsis, DSB repair, and meiotic chromosome segregation.",M2

Our understanding of these processes has been greatly aided by the development of in vitro biochemical assays of RAG binding and cleavage activity. Accumulating evidence suggests that synaptic complex assembly occurs in a step-wise manner and that the RAG proteins catalyze RSS cleavage by mechanisms similar to those used by bacterial transposases. In this chapter we will review the molecular mechanisms of RAG synaptic complex assembly and 12/23-regulated RSS cleavage, focusing on recent advances that shed new light on these processes.",M2

The extent of synapsis is over all reduced and NDJ levels of a large endogenous chromosome and of artificial chromosomes (YACs) rise to twice the level of wild type strains. A substantial proportion of mis-segregating YACs had undergone crossing over. This demonstrates that different functions of Zip1 display differential sensitivities to changes in expression levels.",M2
19714216,"A high incidence of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin is not associated with substantial pachytene loss in heterozygous male mice carrying multiple simple robertsonian translocations.Meiosis is a complex type of cell division that involves homologous chromosome pairing, <e>synapsis</e>, recombination, and segregation. When any of these processes is altered, cellular checkpoints arrest meiosis progression and induce cell elimination. Meiotic impairment is particularly frequent in organisms bearing chromosomal translocations. When chromosomal translocations appear in heterozygosis, the chromosomes involved may not correctly complete synapsis, recombination, and/or segregation, thus promoting the activation of checkpoints that lead to the death of the meiocytes. In mammals and other organisms, the unsynapsed chromosomal regions are subject to a process called meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC). Different degrees of asynapsis could contribute to disturb the normal loading of MSUC proteins, interfering with autosome and sex chromosome gene expression and triggering a massive pachytene cell death. We report that in mice that are heterozygous for eight multiple simple Robertsonian translocations, most pachytene spermatocytes bear trivalents with unsynapsed regions that incorporate, in a stage-dependent manner, proteins involved in MSUC (e.g., gammaH2AX, ATR, ubiquitinated-H2A, SUMO-1, and XMR). These spermatocytes have a correct MSUC response and are not eliminated during pachytene and most of them proceed into diplotene. However, we found a high incidence of apoptotic spermatocytes at the metaphase stage. These results suggest that in Robertsonian heterozygous mice synapsis defects on most pachytene cells do not trigger a prophase-I checkpoint. Instead, meiotic impairment seems to mainly rely on the action of a checkpoint acting at the metaphase stage. We propose that a low stringency of the pachytene checkpoint could help to increase the chances that spermatocytes with synaptic defects will complete meiotic divisions and differentiate into viable gametes. This scenario, despite a reduction of fertility, allows the spreading of Robertsonian translocations, explaining the multitude of natural Robertsonian populations described in the mouse.",M2
19686734,"A novel mammalian HORMA domain-containing protein, HORMAD1, preferentially associates with unsynapsed meiotic chromosomes.HORMA domain-containing proteins regulate interactions between homologous chromosomes (homologs) during meiosis in a wide range of eukaryotes. We have identified a mouse HORMA domain-containing protein, HORMAD1, and biochemically and cytologically shown it to be associated with the meiotic chromosome axis. HORMAD1 first accumulates on the chromosomes during the leptotene to zygotene stages of meiotic prophase I. As germ cells progress into the pachytene stage, HORMAD1 disappears from the synapsed chromosomal regions. However, once the chromosomes desynapse during the diplotene stage, HORMAD1 again accumulates on the chromosome axis of the desynapsed homologs. HORMAD1 thus preferentially localizes to unsynapsed or desynapsed chromosomal regions during the prophase I stage of meiosis. Analysis of mutant strains lacking different components of the synaptonemal complex (SC) revealed that establishment of the SC is required for the displacement of HORMAD1 from the chromosome axis. Our results therefore strongly suggest that also mammalian cells use a HORMA domain-containing protein as part of a surveillance system that monitors <e>synapsis</e> or other interactions between homologs.",M2

Here we show that short sequence elements enriched in the corresponding chromosome regions selectively recruit these proteins in vivo. In vitro analysis using SELEX indicates that the binding specificity of each protein arises from a combination of two zinc fingers and an adjacent domain. Insertion of a cluster of recruiting motifs into a chromosome lacking its endogenous pairing centre is sufficient to restore homologous pairing, synapsis, crossover recombination and segregation. These findings help to illuminate how chromosome sites mediate essential aspects of meiotic chromosome dynamics.",M2

Heterochromatic blocks of some autosomes are involved into nonhomologous association with formation of chromocenter in early meiotic prophase I. Fluorescent in situ hybridization with ribosomal DNA-probe revealed the signal on only two pairs of middle chromosomes, which did not participate in the chromocenter formation, therefore appearance of ectopic contacts was not caused by the nucleolus formation. The analysis showed that heterochromatin in the chromocenter was eliminated spatially and functionally from main meiotic events. Heterochromatin does not participate in the bouquet formation, initiation of homologous pairing, and recombination events. Heterochromatic polymorphism results in asymmetric synaptonemal complexes with different degree of synaptic adjustment. Meiotic axis of sex univalent (XO -- sex male determination) is split in different regions irrespective of heterochromatin localization.",M2
19502597,"Molecular mechanism underlying RAG1/RAG2 synaptic complex formation.Two lymphoid cell-specific proteins, RAG1 and RAG2 (RAG), initiate V(D)J recombination by assembling a synaptic complex with recombination signal sequences (RSSs) abutting two different antigen receptor gene coding segments, and then introducing a DNA double strand break at the end of each RSS. Despite the biological importance of this system, the structure of the synaptic complex, and the RAG protein stoichiometry and arrangement of DNA within the synaptosome, remains poorly understood. Here we applied atomic force microscopy to directly visualize and characterize RAG synaptic complexes. We report that the pre-cleavage RAG synaptic complex contains about twice the protein content as a RAG complex bound to a single RSS, with a calculated mass consistent with a pair of RAG heterotetramers. In the synaptic complex, the RSSs are predominantly oriented in a side-by-side configuration with no DNA strand crossover. The mass of the synaptic complex, and the conditions under which it is formed in vitro, favors an association model of assembly in which isolated RAG-RSS complexes undergo <e>synapsis</e> mediated by RAG protein-protein interactions. The replacement of Mg2+ cations with Ca2+ leads to a dramatic change in protein stoichiometry for all RAG-RSS complexes, suggesting that the cation composition profoundly influences the type of complex assembled.",M2

RESULTS: Although in the vast majority of pachytene cells all autosomes were paired and synapsed, in a small number of nuclei the heterochromatic C-positive terminal region of bivalent 11 remained unpaired. The analysis of 75 CPA cells at pachytene revealed a mean of 43.22 MLH1 foci per nucleus and 1.07 MLH1 foci in each CPA bivalent 11, always positioned in the region homologous to HSA chromosome 21.

In the present study, we have analysed the meiotic alterations leading to infertility in Cdk2-/- male mice. We have studied the distribution and dynamics of several proteins related to meiosis progression, such as synaptonemal complex proteins, cohesin complexes, and centromere-, telomere- and recombination-related proteins.

19463809,"Persistence of histone H2AX phosphorylation after meiotic chromosome <e>synapsis</e> and abnormal centromere cohesion in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (Parp-1) null oocytes.In spite of the impact of aneuploidy on human health little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of structural or numerical chromosome abnormalities during meiosis. Here, we provide novel evidence indicating that lack of PARP-1 function during oogenesis predisposes the female gamete to genome instability. During prophase I of meiosis, a high proportion of Parp-1((-/-)) mouse oocytes exhibit a spectrum of meiotic defects including incomplete homologous chromosome synapsis or persistent histone H2AX phosphorylation in fully synapsed chromosomes at the late pachytene stage. Moreover, the X chromosome bivalent is also prone to exhibit persistent double strand DNA breaks (DSBs). In striking contrast, such defects were not detected in mutant pachytene spermatocytes. In fully-grown wild type oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage, PARP-1 protein associates with nuclear speckles and upon meiotic resumption, undergoes a striking re-localization towards spindle poles as well as pericentric heterochromatin domains at the metaphase II stage. Notably, a high proportion of in vivo matured Parp-1((-/-)) oocytes show lack of recruitment of the kinetochore-associated protein BUB3 to centromeric domains and fail to maintain metaphase II arrest. Defects in chromatin modifications in the form of persistent histone H2AX phosphorylation during prophase I of meiosis and deficient sister chromatid cohesion during metaphase II predispose mutant oocytes to premature anaphase II onset upon removal from the oviductal environment. Our results indicate that PARP-1 plays a critical role in the maintenance of chromosome stability at key stages of meiosis in the female germ line. Moreover, in the metaphase II stage oocyte PARP-1 is required for the regulation of centromere structure and function through a mechanism that involves the recruitment of BUB3 protein to centromeric domains.",M2

The RAG1 nonamer binding domain (NBD) forms a tightly interwoven dimer that binds and synapses two nonamer elements, with each NBD making contact with both DNA molecules. Biochemical and biophysical experiments confirm that the two nonamers are in close proximity in the RAG1/2-DNA synaptic complex and demonstrate the functional importance of the protein-DNA contacts revealed in the structure.

Although a number of genes regulating homologous chromosome pairing and <e>synapsis</e> have been identified in the plant kingdom, their molecular basis remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified a novel gene, PAIR3 (HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS 3), required for homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in rice. Two independent alleles, designated pair3-1 and pair3-2, were identified in our T-DNA insertional mutant library which could not form bivalents due to failure of homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis at diakinesis, resulting in sterility in both male and female gametes. Suppression of PAIR3 by RNAi produced similar results to the T-DNA insertion lines. PAIR3 encodes a protein that contains putative coiled-coil motifs, but does not have any close homologs in other organisms. PAIR3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis.

Although suggested by cytological work, in vivo links between the structural proteins of the synaptonemal complex and the proteins of the recombination process have not previously been made. The central element of the synaptonemal complex is traversed by DNA at sites of recombination and presents a logical place to look for interactions between these components. There are four known central element proteins, three of which have previously been mutated. Here, we complete the set by creating a null mutation in the Syce1 gene in mouse. The resulting disruption of synapsis in these animals has allowed us to demonstrate a biochemical interaction between the structural protein SYCE2 and the repair protein RAD51. In normal meiosis, this interaction may be responsible for promoting homologous synapsis from sites of recombination.",M2
19238420,"Relationship between incomplete <e>synapsis</e> and chiasma localization.One of the subjects within the meiotic field that has been actively investigated in the recent years is the temporal and functional relationships between meiotic recombination, cohesin loading and synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly. Although the study of meiotic mutants has shed some light, many questions remain to be answered. Here, we have studied this topic in the orthopteran Paratettix meridionalis, a species with telocentric chromosomes, which shows two unusual cytological features: pairing and synapsis of homologues during prophase I are restricted to the non-centromeric distal regions and extremely distal chiasma localization in metaphase I bivalents. In order to determine whether there is a relationship between both phenomena, we have used: (1) a spreading technique for following the ultrastructure of SC assembly and (2) immunofluorescence for SMC3 and SMC1alpha cohesin subunits, which mark the development of the axial element (a SC component); the histone gamma-H2AX, which mostly labels the sites of double-strand breaks; and the recombinase RAD51. Spermatocytes showed conspicuous polarization of both the maturation of cohesin axes and the initiation of meiotic recombination events. Consequently, it is proposed that maturation of cohesin axes, which begins in very distal regions, could drive the latter loading of recombinases to such regions. This restricted distribution of recombination events along homologues would finally be responsible for the incomplete pairing and synapsis observed in all autosomes of the complement and hence for chiasma localization.",M2

Recently it was discovered that the chromatin of asynapsed chromosome segments is transcriptionally silenced, providing new insights into the connection between asynapsis and meiotic impairment.",M2
19056898,"Initiation of meiotic chromosome <e>synapsis</e> at centromeres in budding yeast.Previous studies of synaptonemal complex assembly in budding yeast have suggested that chromosome synapsis initiates at the sites of crossing over. The data presented here, however, indicate that centromeric regions are preferred sites for synapsis initiation. At early times during meiosis in wild type, the Zip1 protein (a major building block of the synaptonemal complex) localizes specifically to centromeric regions. As synapsis progresses and linear stretches of Zip1 are formed, the majority of stretches are associated with a centromere, as expected if the Zip1 protein present at the centromere polymerized outward along the chromosome arm. In many cases, the centromere is present at one end of a linear stretch, suggesting that synapsis is often unidirectional. Furthermore, the Zip2 protein, a protein that promotes Zip1 polymerization, is often present at the opposite end from the centromere, implying that Zip2 and associated proteins move at the leading edge of Zip1 polymerization. Surprisingly, synapsis initiation at centromeres is independent of the Zip3 protein, which plays a major role in synapsis initiation events at noncentromeric locations. Our data provide evidence for two classes of synapsis initiation events that differ in location, timing, genetic requirements, and relationship to meiotic recombination.",M2

Unfortunately, due to the time-frame in which meiosis takes place in the mammalian males and females, most of the studies performed so far have focused on analyzing male meiosis. Recently, some studies focusing on human meiosis have been published. Some of them revealed important sex-specific differences that may be involved in the predominant involvement of the human female in the genesis of aneuploidy.

18948706,"Homologue pairing, recombination and segregation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Meiosis in the free-living, hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is marked by the same highly conserved features observed in other sexually reproducing systems. Accurate chromosome segregation at the meiotic divisions depends on earlier landmark events of meiotic prophase, including the pairing of homologous chromosomes, <e>synapsis</e> between them, and the formation of crossovers. Dissection of these processes has revealed a unique simplification of meiotic mechanisms that impact the interpretation of meiotic chromosome behaviour in more complex systems. Chromosome sites required for chromosome pairing are consolidated to one end of each chromosome, the many sites of recombination initiation are resolved into a single crossover for each chromosome pair, and the diffuse (holocentric) kinetic activity that extends along the length of the mitotic chromosomes is reduced to a single end of each meiotic chromosome. Consequently, studies from the nematode have illuminated and challenged long-standing concepts of homologue pairing mechanisms, crossover interference, and kinetochore structure. Because chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination can proceed independently of one another, C. elegans has provided a simplified system for studying these processes and the mechanisms mediating their coordination during meiosis. This review covers the major features of C. elegans meiosis with emphasis on its contributions to understanding essential meiotic processes.",M2
18826431,"TaASY1 promotes homologous chromosome interactions and is affected by deletion of Ph1.During meiosis, chromosomes are sorted into homologous pairs as a preface to their intimate association via recombination and <e>synapsis</e>. However, little is known about the mechanism used to distinguish homologous chromosomes from other chromosomes present in the nucleus. Studies in wheat (Triticum aestivum) have shown that the Pairing homoeologous 1 (Ph1) locus is required to suppress interactions between genetically similar homoeologous chromosomes. Here we show that absence of Ph1 causes increased transcription of Asynapsis 1 (ASY1), a gene that encodes an axial-element-associated protein that is essential for synapsis and cross-over formation in Arabidopsis and rice. Localisation of ASY1 during meiosis is also affected by deletion of Ph1. In addition, transgenic wheat mutants with decreased activity of TaASY1 display reduced synapsis during prophase I and exhibit pairing between homoeologous chromosomes at metaphase I. These results suggest that ASY1 is required to promote interactions between homologous chromosomes in bread wheat, and that Ph1 has a gene regulatory role, which is consistent with its suggested genetic identity as a Cdk-like gene. Broader implications of this research suggest that we could use the Taasy1 mutants to assess their efficacy in alien chromatin introgression studies, as seen with the ph1b mutant.",M2

Exposure to decreased temperature (16 degrees C) caused a noticeable increase in the rate of asynapses of homologous chromosomes, whereas this effect was insignificant for F30 inbreeding generation. Long-term inbreeding has a substantial effect on the relative positions of chromosomes in the nurse cell nuclei. This is visually evident only in the interstrain hybrids between highly inbred strains LA (F923) and HA (F923) or between either strain and laboratory strain Canton S or the flies from the natural population, where abnormalities in homologous chromosome synapsis are observed in virtually all nuclei.",M2
18802469,"Deletion of the pluripotency-associated Tex19.1 gene causes activation of endogenous retroviruses and defective spermatogenesis in mice.As genetic information is transmitted through successive generations, it passes between pluripotent cells in the early embryo and germ cells in the developing foetus and adult animal. Tex19.1 encodes a protein of unknown function, whose expression is restricted to germ cells and pluripotent cells. During male spermatogenesis, Tex19.1 expression is highest in mitotic spermatogonia and diminishes as these cells differentiate and progress through meiosis. In pluripotent stem cells, Tex19.1 expression is also downregulated upon differentiation. However, it is not clear whether Tex19.1 has an essential function in germ cells or pluripotent stem cells, or what that function might be. To analyse the potential role of Tex19.1 in pluripotency or germ cell function we have generated Tex19.1(-/-) knockout mice and analysed the Tex19.1(-/-) mutant phenotype. Adult Tex19.1(-/-) knockout males exhibit impaired spermatogenesis. Immunostaining and histological analysis revealed defects in meiotic chromosome <e>synapsis</e>, the persistence of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis, and a loss of post-meiotic germ cells in the testis. Furthermore, expression of a class of endogenous retroviruses is upregulated during meiosis in the Tex19.1(-/-) testes. Increased transposition of endogenous retroviruses in the germline of Tex19.1(-/-) mutant mice, and the concomitant increase in DNA damage, may be sufficient to disrupt the normal processes of recombination and chromosome synapsis during meiosis and cause defects in spermatogenesis. Our results suggest that Tex19.1 is part of a specialised mechanism that operates in the germline to repress transposable genetic elements and maintain genomic stability through successive generations.",M2

18694567,"Mouse maelstrom, a component of nuage, is essential for spermatogenesis and transposon repression in meiosis.Tight control of transposon activity is essential for the integrity of the germline. Recently, a germ-cell-specific organelle, nuage, was proposed to play a role in transposon repression. To test this hypothesis, we disrupted a murine homolog of a Drosophila nuage protein Maelstrom. Effects on male meiotic chromosome <e>synapsis</e> and derepression of transposable elements (TEs) were observed. In the adult Mael(-/-) testes, LINE-1 (L1) derepression occurred at the onset of meiosis. As a result, Mael(-/-) spermatocytes were flooded with L1 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) that accumulated in large cytoplasmic enclaves and nuclei. Mael(-/-) spermatocytes with nuclear L1 RNPs exhibited massive DNA damage and severe chromosome asynapsis even in the absence of SPO11-generated meiotic double-strand breaks. This study demonstrates that MAEL, a nuage component, is indispensable for the silencing of TEs and identifies the initiation of meiosis as an important step in TE control in the male germline.",M2
18679702,"Unexpected behavior of an inverted rye chromosome arm in wheat.Distal location of chiasmata in chromosome arms is thought to be a consequence of the distal initiation of <e>synapsis</e>. Observations of meiotic behavior of a rye chromosome with an inverted arm show that patterns of chiasma distribution and frequency are also inverted; therefore, the patterns of synapsis and chiasma distribution are independent, and recombination frequency along a chromosome is position-independent and segment-specific. Since cases of random distribution of chiasmata and recombination are known in rye, a genetic mechanism must be present that licenses specific chromosome regions for recombination. Large differences in the metaphase I pairing of the inversion in various combinations of two armed and telocentric chromosomes confirm the major role of the telomere bouquet in early homologue recognition. However, occasional synapsis and chiasmate pairing of the distal regions of normal arms with the proximal regions of the inversion suggest that an alternative mechanism for juxtaposing of homologues must also be present. Synapsis in inversion heterozygotes was mostly complete but in the antiparallel orientation, hence defying homology, but non-homologues never synapsed. Instances of synapsis strictly limited to the chiasma-capable segments of the arm suggest that, in rye, both recombination-dependent and recombination-independent mechanisms for homologue recognition must be present.",M2
18663141,"Extensive meiotic asynapsis in mice antagonises meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin and consequently disrupts meiotic sex chromosome inactivation.Chromosome <e>synapsis</e> during zygotene is a prerequisite for the timely homologous recombinational repair of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Unrepaired DSBs are thought to trigger apoptosis during midpachytene of male meiosis if synapsis fails. An early pachytene response to asynapsis is meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC), which, in normal males, silences the X and Y chromosomes (meiotic sex chromosome inactivation [MSCI]). In this study, we show that MSUC occurs in Spo11-null mouse spermatocytes with extensive asynapsis but lacking meiotic DSBs. In contrast, three mutants (Dnmt3l, Msh5, and Dmc1) with high levels of asynapsis and numerous persistent unrepaired DSBs have a severely impaired MSUC response. We suggest that MSUC-related proteins, including the MSUC initiator BRCA1, are sequestered at unrepaired DSBs. All four mutants fail to silence the X and Y chromosomes (MSCI failure), which is sufficient to explain the midpachytene apoptosis. Apoptosis does not occur in mice with a single additional asynapsed chromosome with unrepaired meiotic DSBs and no disturbance of MSCI.",M2
18597662,"Prelude to a division.Accurate segregation of chromosomes during meiosis requires physical links between homologs. These links are usually established through chromosome pairing, <e>synapsis</e>, and recombination, which occur during meiotic prophase. How chromosomes pair with their homologous partners is one of the outstanding mysteries of meiosis. Surprisingly, experimental evidence indicates that different organisms have found more than one way to accomplish this feat. Whereas some species depend on recombination machinery to achieve homologous pairing, others are able to pair and synapse their homologs in the absence of recombination. To ensure specific pairing between homologous chromosomes, both recombination-dependent and recombination-independent mechanisms must strike the proper balance between forces that promote chromosome interactions and activities that temper the promiscuity of those interactions. The initiation of synapsis is likely to be a tightly regulated step in a process that must be mechanically coupled to homolog pairing.",M2
19825567,"SWI1 is required for meiotic chromosome remodeling events.The Arabidopsis dsy10 mutant was previously identified as being defective in the <e>synapsis</e> of meiotic chromosomes resulting in male and female sterility. We report here the molecular analysis of the mutation and show that it represents a T-DNA insertion in the third exon of the SWI1 gene. Four mutations have now been identified in SWI1, several of which exhibit different phenotypes. For example, the swi1-1 and dyad mutations only affect meiosis in megasporocytes, while the swi1-2 and dsy10 mutations block both male and female meiosis. Furthermore, as part of a detailed cytological characterization of dsy10 meiocytes, we identified several differences during male meiosis between the swi1-2 and dys10 mutants, including variations in the formation of axial elements, the distribution of cohesin proteins and the timing of the premature loss of sister chromatid cohesion. We demonstrate that dsy10 represents a complete loss-of-function mutation, while a truncated form of SWI1 is expressed during meiosis in swi1-2 plants. We further show that dys10 meiocytes exhibit alterations in modified histone patterns, including acetylated histone H3 and dimethylated histone H3-Lysine 4.",M2
18535915,"Pairing and <e>synapsis</e> in wild type Arabidopsis thaliana.A spreading technique was used to perform a structural analysis of prophase I nuclei in pollen mother cells (PMCs) of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana. In leptotene, all chromosomes developed fully axial elements before a presynaptic alignment was observed. Pairing and synapsis start in regions close to the telomeres at early zygotene. Interstitial synaptonemal complex (SC) stretches were found to occur at several sites per bivalent at mid zygotene. Within individual bivalents, extensive regions of SC formation often existed at the same time as other extensive regions that were unsynapsed. Also in the same nucleus, one bivalent might have several SC segments, while other bivalents have only a few. The classical bouquet was not so evident as in other plant species. Length measurements of the five pachytene bivalents have allowed the elaboration of a pachytene karyotype. Pachytene chromatin compaction in Arabidopsis was significantly less than that observed in the other species analysed and this is paralleled with a higher recombination rate (centimorgans per megabase).",M2

Recombination and synapsis are well-studied but homologous pairing still holds many black boxes. In the past several years, many studies in plants have yielded insights into the mechanisms of chromosome pairing interactions. Research in several plant species showed the importance of telomere clustering on the nuclear envelope (telomere bouquet formation) in facilitating alignment of homologous chromosomes. Homologous pairing was also shown to be tied to the early stages of recombination by mutant analyses in Arabidopsis and maize. In contrast, little is known about the mechanisms that guide homolog interaction after their rough alignment by the bouquet and before the close-range recombination-dependent homology search. The relatively large and complex genomes of plants may require additional mechanisms, not needed in small genome eukaryotes, to distinguish between local homology of duplicated genes or transposable elements and global chromosomal homology. Plants provide an excellent large genome model for the study of homologous pairing and dissection of this process.",M2

In spite of the number of scientific reports describing the occurrence of structural chromosome abnormalities, their meiotic behavior and gametic products, little is known in domestic animal species about the functional effects of such chromosome aberrations in the germ cell line of carriers. However, some interesting facts gained from recent and previous studies on the meiotic behavior of chromosome abnormalities of domestic animals permit us to discuss, in the frame of recent knowledge emerging from mouse and human investigations, the possible mechanism implicated in the well known association between meiotic disruption and chromosome pairing failure. New cytogenetic techniques, based on molecular and immunofluorescent analyses, are allowing a better description of meiotic processes, including gamete production. The present communication reviews the knowledge of the meiotic consequences of chromosome abnormalities in domestic animals.",M2

Spermatocytes of diploid shrimp showed typical morphological characteristics of eukaryote SC, with complete synapsis of bivalents. No recognizable bivalent associated with sex chromosomes was observed in spermatocytes of diploid shrimp. However, differences in morphology of SC, including unsynapsed univalents, bivalents, totally paired trivalents with non-homologous synapsis, partner switches and triple synapsis were identified at early pachytene stage of triploid spermatocytes. Triple synapsis was especially common at late pachytene stage in spermatocytes of triploid shrimp. The observed abnormal synapsis behavior of chromosomes in spermatocytes indicated that triploid male shrimp may find it difficult to develop normal haploid sperm.",M2

We also propose an alternative description of Mendel's second law of independent assortment, which refers to the free combination of different pairing centers.

18408354,"Affected homologous chromosome pairing and phosphorylation of testis specific histone, H2AX, in male meiosis under FKBP6 deficiency.A gene for FK506 binding protein 6 (Fkbp6) expresses during a specific stage of male and female meiosis. Disruption of the gene influences male reproduction, i.e. arrests spermatogenesis, but not female reproduction. Using the mouse model (targeted disruption), the role of the gene in homologous chromosome pairing has been demonstrated in a previous study. For further understanding the function of Fkbp6 in chromosome <e>synapsis</e>, we evaluated chromosome pairings during male meiosis in the as/as rat, a spontaneous null mutation, and compared them with those of the mouse model. Electron microscopy of the pachytene nuclei unveiled several types of abnormal chromosome pairing in the rat model, as shown in the mouse previously. The frequencies of aberrant pairings in the knockout mice and mutant rats were 42 of 67 nuclei (62.7%) and 20 out of 74 nuclei (27.0%), respectively. In order to clarify the mechanism of male specific infertility in Fkbp6 deficiency, the localization of gammaH2AX, a marker protein of XY chromosome inactivation during male meiosis, was examined. Immunostaining of gammaH2AX unveiled normal localization of the molecule to XY chromosomes (XY body) in both models, showing the independency of FKBP6 in sex chromosome inactivation. Besides the XY body, focal localization of gammaH2AX was observed in accordance with the unsynapsed chromosomes in both types of null animal. These results indicate the fundamental role of Fkbp6 in homologous chromosome synapsis during male meiosis. In conclusion, male specific infertility under Fkbp6 deficiency remains unsolved.",M2
18384767,"Increased frequency of asynapsis and associated meiotic silencing of heterologous chromatin in the presence of irradiation-induced extra DNA double strand breaks.In meiotic prophase of male placental mammals, the heterologous X and Y chromosomes remain largely unsynapsed, which activates meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), leading to formation of the transcriptionally silenced XY body. MSCI is most likely related to meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC), a mechanism that can silence autosomal unsynapsed chromatin. However, heterologous <e>synapsis</e> and escape from silencing also occur. In mammalian species, formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during leptotene precedes meiotic chromosome pairing. These DSBs are essential to achieve full synapsis of homologous chromosomes. We generated 25% extra meiotic DSBs by whole body irradiation of mice. This leads to a significant increase in meiotic recombination frequency. In mice carrying translocation chromosomes with synaptic problems, we observed an approximately 35% increase in asynapsis and MSUC of the nonhomologous region in the smallest chromosome pair following irradiation. However, the same nonhomologous region in the largest chromosome pair, shows complete synapsis and escape from MSUC in almost 100% of the nuclei, irrespective of exposure to irradiation. We propose that prevention of synapsis and associated activation of MSUC is linked to the presence of unrepaired meiotic DSBs in the nonhomologous region. Also, spreading of synaptonemal complex formation from regions of homology may act as an opposing force, and drive heterologous synapsis.",M2
18348867,"Homologous chromosome pairing is completed in crossover defective atzip4 mutant.In transposon-tagged lines of Arabidopsis, we found a mutant that was defective in meiotic chromosome segregation.

The chiasma distribution in atzip4-4 differed from that in the wild-type, involved in a deficiency of interfering crossovers in the mutant genome. On the other hand, FISH staining of loci on two independent chromosomes in mutant meiocytes indicated that homologous chromosome pairing to synapse progresses normally until the pachytene stage, yet homologous chromosomes often separated abruptly at diplotene and diakinesis. These results suggest that AtZIP4 plays an important role in normal crossover formation and meiotic chromosome segregation, but not in homolog search. The relationship of AtZIP4 and other related proteins in meiotic events is discussed and compared with that in yeast.",M2
18316482,"Meiotic failure in male mice lacking an X-linked factor.Meiotic silencing of sex chromosomes may cause their depletion of meiosis-specific genes during evolution. Here, we challenge this hypothesis by reporting the identification of TEX11 as the first X-encoded meiosis-specific factor in mice. TEX11 forms discrete foci on synapsed regions of meiotic chromosomes and appears to be a novel constituent of meiotic nodules involved in recombination. Loss of TEX11 function causes chromosomal asynapsis and reduced crossover formation, leading to elimination of spermatocytes, respectively, at the pachytene and anaphase I stages. Specifically, TEX11-deficient spermatocytes with asynapsed autosomes undergo apoptosis at the pachytene stage, while those with only asynapsed sex chromosomes progress. However, cells that survive the pachytene stage display chromosome nondisjunction at the first meiotic division, resulting in cell death and male infertility. TEX11 interacts with SYCP2, which is an integral component of the synaptonemal complex lateral elements. Thus, TEX11 promotes initiation and/or maintenance of <e>synapsis</e> and formation of crossovers, and may provide a physical link between these two meiotic processes.",M2

Specifically, TEX15-deficient spermatocytes exhibit a failure in chromosomal synapsis. In mutant spermatocytes, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed, but localization of the recombination proteins RAD51 and DMC1 to meiotic chromosomes is severely impaired. Based on these data, we propose that TEX15 regulates the loading of DNA repair proteins onto sites of DSBs and, thus, its absence causes a failure in meiotic recombination.",M2
18267094,"HTP-3 links DSB formation with homolog pairing and crossing over during C. elegans meiosis.Repair of the programmed meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate recombination must be coordinated with homolog pairing to generate crossovers capable of directing chromosome segregation. Chromosome pairing and <e>synapsis</e> proceed independently of recombination in worms and flies, suggesting a paradoxical lack of coregulation. Here, we find that the meiotic axis component HTP-3 links DSB formation with homolog pairing and synapsis. HTP-3 forms complexes with the DSB repair components MRE-11/RAD-50 and the meiosis-specific axis component HIM-3. Loss of htp-3 or mre-11 recapitulates meiotic phenotypes consistent with a failure to generate DSBs, suggesting that HTP-3 associates with MRE-11/RAD-50 in a complex required for meiotic DSB formation. Loss of HTP-3 eliminates HIM-3 localization to axes and HIM-3-dependent homolog alignment, synapsis, and crossing over. Our study reveals a mechanism for coupling meiotic DSB formation with homolog pairing through the essential participation of an axis component with complexes mediating both processes.",M2

The primary defect of desynaptic plants was identified as nonhomologous (heterologous) chromosome synapsis, which was observed by electron microscopy of synaptonemal complexes (SCs) in meiotic prophase I. Synapsis defects involved switches of synapsing axial elements to nonhomologous partners, asynapsis in the switching region, and foldbacks formed by the SC lateral elements. Defective bivalent formation was observed at later stages: the univalent number varied and multivalent chromosome associations were observed in single cells in metaphase I. The desynaptic phenotype was controlled by two recessive genes, sy8a and sy8b, which acted and were inherited independently. In a hybrid combination with line Ku-2/63, the desynaptic phenotype was suppressed by the dominant allele of a third gene for inhibitor I; the segregation in hybrid families corresponded to 57:7.",M2
17997150,"Disruption of pairing and <e>synapsis</e> of chromosomes causes stage-specific apoptosis of male meiotic cells.During meiosis, DNA replication is followed by two successive rounds of chromosome segregation (meiosis I and II), which give rise to genetically diverse haploid gametes. The prophase of the first meiotic division is highly regulated and alignment and synapsis of the homologous chromosomes during this stage are mediated by the synaptonemal complex. Incorrect assembly of the synaptonemal complex results in cell death, impaired meiotic recombination and aneuploidy. Oocytes with meiotic defects often survive the first meiotic prophase and give rise to aneuploid gametes. Similarly affected spermatocytes, on the other hand, almost always undergo apoptosis at a male-specific meiotic checkpoint, located specifically at epithelial stage IV during spermatogenesis. Many examples of this stage IV-specific arrest have been described for several genetic mouse models in which DNA repair or meiotic recombination are abrogated. Interestingly, in C. elegans, meiotic recombination and synapsis are monitored by two separate checkpoint pathways. Therefore we studied spermatogenesis in several knockout mice (Sycp1(-/-), Sycp3(-/-), Smc1beta(-/-) and Sycp3/Sycp1 and Sycp3/Smc1beta double-knockouts) that are specifically defective in meiotic pairing and synapsis. Like for recombination defects, we found that all these genotypes also specifically arrest at epithelial stage IV. It seems that the epithelial stage IV checkpoint eliminates spermatocytes that fail a certain quality check, being either synapsis or DNA damage related.",M2
17980632,"S-S <e>synapsis</e> during class switch recombination is promoted by distantly located transcriptional elements and activation-induced deaminase.Molecular mechanisms underlying synapsis of activation-induced deaminase (AID)-targeted S regions during class switch recombination (CSR) are poorly understood. By using chromosome conformation capture techniques, we found that in B cells, the Emicro and 3'Ealpha enhancers were in close spatial proximity, forming a unique chromosomal loop configuration. B cell activation led to recruitment of the germline transcript (GLT) promoters to the Emicro:3'Ealpha complex in a cytokine-dependent fashion. This structure facilitated S-S synapsis because Smicro was proximal to Emicro and a downstream S region was corecruited with the targeted GLT promoter to Emicro:3'Ealpha. We propose that GLT promoter association with the Emicro:3'Ealpha complex creates an architectural scaffolding that promotes S-S synapsis during CSR and that these interactions are stabilized by AID. Thus, the S-S synaptosome is formed as a result of the self-organizing transcription system that regulates GLT expression and may serve to guard against spurious chromosomal translocations.",M2

Its presence in DNA strand-exchange reactions in vitro results in a significant stimulation of the overall reaction rate. Using untagged Rad54, we show that this stimulation can be attributed to enhancement of the formation of a key reaction intermediate known as DNA networks. Using a novel, single DNA molecule, dual-optical tweezers approach we show how Rad54 stimulates DNA network formation. We discovered that Rad54 oligomers possess a unique ability to cross-bridge or bind double-stranded DNA molecules positioned in close proximity. Further, Rad54 oligomers rapidly translocate double-stranded DNA while simultaneously inducing topological loops in the DNA at the locus of the oligomer. The combination of the cross-bridging and double-stranded DNA translocation activities of Rad54 stimulates the formation of DNA networks, leading to rapid and efficient DNA strand exchange by Rad51.",M2
17947423,"The formation of the central element of the synaptonemal complex may occur by multiple mechanisms: the roles of the N- and C-terminal domains of the Drosophila C(3)G protein in mediating <e>synapsis</e> and recombination.In Drosophila melanogaster oocytes, the C(3)G protein comprises the transverse filaments (TFs) of the synaptonemal complex (SC). Like other TF proteins, such as Zip1p in yeast and SCP1 in mammals, C(3)G is composed of a central coiled-coil-rich domain flanked by N- and C-terminal globular domains. Here, we analyze in-frame deletions within the N- and C-terminal regions of C(3)G in Drosophila oocytes. As is the case for Zip1p, a C-terminal deletion of C(3)G fails to attach to the lateral elements of the SC. Instead, this C-terminal deletion protein forms a large cylindrical polycomplex structure. EM analysis of this structure reveals a polycomplex of concentric rings alternating dark and light bands. However, unlike both yeast and mammals, all three proteins deleted for N-terminal regions completely abolished both SC and polycomplex formation. Both the N- and C-terminal deletions significantly reduce or abolish meiotic recombination similarly to c(3)G null homozygotes. To explain these data, we propose that in Drosophila the N terminus, but not the C-terminal globular domain, of C(3)G is critical for the formation of antiparallel pairs of C(3)G homodimers that span the central region and thus for assembly of complete TFs, while the C terminus is required to affix these homodimers to the lateral elements.",M2

Mutations in the prom-1 locus cause a strong reduction in bivalent formation, which results in increased embryonic lethality and a Him phenotype. Furthermore, retarded and asynchronous nuclear reorganization as well as reduced homologous <e>synapsis</e> occur during meiotic prophase. Accumulation of recombination protein RAD-51 in meiotic nuclei suggests disturbed repair of double-stranded DNA breaks.

We, therefore, propose that prom-1 regulates the timely progression through meiotic prophase I and that in its absence the recognition of homologous chromosomes is strongly impaired.",M2
17720899,"Terminal regions of wheat chromosomes select their pairing partners in meiosis.Many plant species, including important crops like wheat, are polyploids that carry more than two sets of genetically related chromosomes capable of meiotic pairing. To safeguard a diploid-like behavior at meiosis, many polyploids evolved genetic loci that suppress incorrect pairing and recombination of homeologues. The Ph1 locus in wheat was proposed to ensure homologous pairing by controlling the specificity of centromere associations that precede chromosome pairing. Using wheat chromosomes that carry rye centromeres, we show that the centromere associations in early meiosis are not based on homology and that the Ph1 locus has no effect on such associations. Although centromeres indeed undergo a switch from nonhomologous to homologous associations in meiosis, this process is driven by the terminally initiated <e>synapsis</e>. The centromere has no effect on metaphase I chiasmate chromosome associations: homologs with identical or different centromeres, in the presence and absence of Ph1, pair the same. A FISH analysis of the behavior of centromeres and distal chromomeres in telocentric and bi-armed chromosomes demonstrates that it is not the centromeric, but rather the subtelomeric, regions that are involved in the correct partner recognition and selection.",M2

As in most eukaryotes, mammalian meiocytes have checkpoints that monitor the fidelity of these processes. We report that the mouse ortholog (Trip13) of pachytene checkpoint 2 (PCH2), an essential component of the synapsis checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans, is required for completion of meiosis in both sexes. TRIP13-deficient mice exhibit spermatocyte death in pachynema and loss of oocytes around birth. The chromosomes of mutant spermatocytes synapse fully, yet retain several markers of recombination intermediates, including RAD51, BLM, and RPA. These chromosomes also exhibited the chiasmata markers MLH1 and MLH3, and okadaic acid treatment of mutant spermatocytes caused progression to metaphase I with bivalent chromosomes. Double mutant analysis demonstrated that the recombination and synapsis genes Spo11, Mei1, Rec8, and Dmc1 are all epistatic to Trip13, suggesting that TRIP13 does not have meiotic checkpoint function in mice. Our data indicate that TRIP13 is required after strand invasion for completing a subset of recombination events, but possibly not those destined to be crossovers. To our knowledge, this is the first model to separate recombination defects from asynapsis in mammalian meiosis, and provides the first evidence that unrepaired DNA damage alone can trigger the pachytene checkpoint response in mice.",M2
17683575,"Expression and functional analysis of TaASY1 during meiosis of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum).BACKGROUND: Pairing and <e>synapsis</e> of homologous chromosomes is required for normal chromosome segregation and the exchange of genetic material via recombination during meiosis. Synapsis is complete at pachytene following the formation of a tri-partite proteinaceous structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC). In yeast, HOP1 is essential for formation of the SC, and localises along chromosome axes during prophase I. Homologues in Arabidopsis (AtASY1), Brassica (BoASY1) and rice (OsPAIR2) have been isolated through analysis of mutants that display decreased fertility due to severely reduced synapsis of homologous chromosomes. Analysis of these genes has indicated that they play a similar role to HOP1 in pairing and formation of the SC through localisation to axial/lateral elements of the SC. RESULTS: The full length wheat cDNA and genomic clone, TaASY1, has been isolated, sequenced and characterised. TaASY1 is located on chromosome Group 5 and the open reading frame displays significant nucleotide sequence identity to OsPAIR2 (84%) and AtASY1 (63%). Transcript and protein analysis showed that expression is largely restricted to meiotic tissue, with elevated levels during the stages of prophase I when pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes occur. Immunolocalisation using transmission electron microscopy showed TaASY1 interacts with chromatin that is associated with both axial elements before SC formation as well as lateral elements of formed SCs. CONCLUSION: TaASY1 is a homologue of ScHOP1, AtASY1 and OsPAIR2 and is the first gene to be isolated from bread wheat that is involved in pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes.",M2
17674149,"Meiotic recombination in Caenorhabditis elegans.The faithful segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis is dependent on the formation of physical connections (chiasma) that form following reciprocal exchange of DNA molecules during meiotic recombination. Here we review the current knowledge in the Caenorhabditis elegans meiotic recombination field. We discuss recent developments that have improved our understanding of the crucial steps that must precede the initiation and propagation of meiotic recombination. We summarize the pathways that impact on meiotic prophase entry and the current understanding of how chromosomes reorganize and interact to promote homologous chromosome pairing and subsequent <e>synapsis</e>. We pay particular attention to the mechanisms that contribute to meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation and strand exchange processes, and how the C. elegans system compares with other model organisms. Finally, we highlight current and future areas of research that are likely to further our understanding of the meiotic recombination process.",M2
17674148,"ZMM proteins during meiosis: crossover artists at work.Faithful segregation of homologous chromosomes (homologs) during meiosis depends on chiasmata which correspond to crossovers between parental DNA strands. Crossover forming homologous recombination takes place in the context of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous structure that juxtaposes homologs. The coordination between molecular recombination events and assembly of the SC as a structure that provides global connectivity between homologs represents one of the remarkable features of meiosis. ZMM proteins (also known as the <e>synapsis</e> initiation complex = SIC) play crucial roles in both processes providing a link between recombination and SC assembly. The ZMM group includes at least seven functionally collaborating, yet structurally diverse proteins: The transverse filament protein Zip1 establishes stable homolog juxtaposition by polymerizing as an integral component of the SC. Zip2, Zip3, and Zip4 likely mediate protein-protein interactions, while Mer3, Msh4, and Msh5 directly promote steps in DNA recombination. This review focuses on recent insights into ZMM functions in yeast meiosis and draws comparisons to ZMM-related proteins in other model organisms.",M2
17639081,"Hop2/Mnd1 acts on two critical steps in Dmc1-promoted homologous pairing.Meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes ensures their proper segregation at the first division of meiosis and is the main force shaping genetic variation of genomes. The HOP2 and MND1 genes are essential for this recombination: Their disruption results in severe defects in homologous chromosome <e>synapsis</e> and an early-stage failure in meiotic recombination. The mouse Hop2 and Mnd1 proteins form a stable heterodimer (Hop2/Mnd1) that greatly enhances Dmc1-mediated strand invasion. In order to elucidate the mechanism by which Hop2/Mnd1 stimulates Dmc1, we identify several intermediate steps in the homologous pairing reaction promoted by Dmc1. We show that Hop2/Mnd1 greatly stimulates Dmc1 to promote synaptic complex formation on long duplex DNAs, a step previously revealed only for bacterial homologous recombinases. This synaptic alignment is a consequence of the ability of Hop2/Mnd1 to (1) stabilize Dmc1-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nucleoprotein complexes, and (2) facilitate the conjoining of DNA molecules through the capture of double-stranded DNA by the Dmc1-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament. To our knowledge, Hop2/Mnd1 is the first homologous recombinase accessory protein that acts on these two separate and critical steps in mammalian meiotic recombination.",M2
17616720,"Pairing and <e>synapsis</e> in oocytes from female fetuses with euploid and aneuploid chromosome complements.Only little is known about the meiotic prophase events in human oocytes, although some of them are involved in the origin of aneuploidies. Here, a broad study of the pairing and synaptic processes in 3263 human euploid and 2613 aneuploid oocytes (47,XX, +21 and 47,XX, +13), using different techniques and methods, is presented in order to elucidate the characteristics of this essential meiotic process. Our results reaffirm the existence of a common high efficiency in the pairing process leading to the obtainment of a bivalent for all chromosomes studied in euploid and aneuploid cases. Nevertheless, this high efficiency was insufficient to consistently produce trivalents in aneuploid oocytes. Trivalent 21 was only observed in 48.8% of the 47,XX, +21 pachytene-stage oocytes studied, and trivalent 13 was found in 68.7% of the 47,XX, +13 pachytene-stage oocytes analyzed. Our data confirm the hypothesis which suggests that in human oocytes the presence of an extra chromosome could interfere in bouquet dynamics. In addition, the pairing process of the X chromosome is altered in trisomic 21 oocytes, providing evidence of the influence that an extra chromosome 21 may cause meiotic progression.",M2
17576524,"<e>Synapsis</e> with and without recombination in the male meiosis of the leaf-footed bug Holhymenia rubiginosa (Coreidae, Heteroptera).In organisms with chiasmatic meiosis two different relationships have been described between crossing over and synapsis: in one group of organisms synapsis depends on the initiation of meiotic recombination while in the other group it is independent of this initiation. These patterns have been observed mainly in organisms where all meiotic bivalents in the set have similar behaviors. In some heteropteran insects a pair of chromosomes named m chromosomes is known to behave differently from autosomes regarding synapsis and recombination. Here we used immunodetection of a synaptonemal complex component and acid-fixed squashes to investigate the conduct of the small m chromosome pair during the male meiosis in the coreid bug Holhymenia rubiginosa. We found that the m chromosomes form a synaptonemal complex during pachytene, but they are not attached by a chiasma in diakinesis. On the other hand, the autosomal bivalents synapse and recombine regularly. The co-existence of these variant chromosome behaviors during meiosis I add further evidence to the absence of unique patterns regarding the interdependence of synapsis and recombination.",M2
17573343,"<e>Synapsis</e> of loxP sites by Cre recombinase.Cre recombinase catalyzes site-specific recombination between 34-bp loxP sites in a variety of topological and cellular contexts. An obligatory step in the recombination reaction is the association, or synapsis, of Cre-bound loxP sites to form a tetrameric protein assembly that is competent for strand exchange. Using analytical ultracentrifugation and electrophoresis approaches, we have studied the energetics of Cre-mediated synapsis of loxP sites. We found that synapsis occurs with a high affinity (Kd = 10 nM) and is pH-dependent but does not require divalent cations. Surprisingly, the catalytically inactive Cre K201A mutant is fully competent for synapsis of loxP sites, yet the inactive Y324F and R173K mutants are defective for synapsis. These findings have allowed us to determine the first crystal structures of a pre-cleavage Cre-loxP synaptic complex in a configuration representing the starting point in the recombination pathway. When combined with a quantitative analysis of synapsis using loxP mutants, the structures explain how the central 8 bp of the loxP site are able to dictate the order of strand exchange in the Cre system.",M2

Both chromosome morphogenesis and nuclear organization are altered throughout the germlines of syp-3 mutants. Here, our analysis of syp-3 mutants provides insights into the relationship between chromosome conformation and the repair of meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although crossover recombination is severely reduced in syp-3 mutants, the production of viable offspring accompanied by the disappearance of RAD-51 foci suggests that DSBs are being repaired in these synapsis-defective mutants. Our studies indicate that once interhomolog recombination is impaired, both intersister recombination and nonhomologous end-joining pathways may contribute to repair during germline meiosis. Moreover, our studies suggest that the conformation of chromosomes may influence the mode of DSB repair employed during meiosis.",M2
17565948,"SYP-3 restricts synaptonemal complex assembly to bridge paired chromosome axes during meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans.Synaptonemal complex (SC) formation must be regulated to occur only between aligned pairs of homologous chromosomes, ultimately ensuring proper chromosome segregation in meiosis. Here we identify SYP-3, a coiled-coil protein that is required for assembly of the central region of the SC and for restricting its loading to occur only in an appropriate context, forming structures that bridge the axes of paired meiotic chromosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that inappropriate loading of central region proteins interferes with homolog pairing, likely by triggering a premature change in chromosome configuration during early prophase that terminates the search for homologs. As a result, syp-3 mutants lack chiasmata and exhibit increased chromosome mis-segregation. Altogether, our studies lead us to propose that SYP-3 regulates <e>synapsis</e> along chromosomes, contributing to meiotic progression in early prophase.",M2
17543861,"The nuclear envelope protein Matefin/SUN-1 is required for homologous pairing in C. elegans meiosis.We identify a highly specific mutation (jf18) in the Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear envelope protein matefin MTF-1/SUN-1 that provides direct evidence for active involvement of the nuclear envelope in homologous chromosome pairing in C. elegans meiosis. The reorganization of chromatin in early meiosis is disrupted in mtf-1/sun-1(jf18) gonads, concomitant with the absence of presynaptic homolog alignment. <e>Synapsis</e> is established precociously and nonhomologously. Wild-type leptotene/zygotene nuclei show patch-like aggregations of the ZYG-12 protein, which fail to develop in mtf-1/sun-1(jf18) mutants. These patches remarkably colocalize with a component of the cis-acting chromosomal pairing center (HIM-8) rather than the centrosome. Our data on this mtf-1/sun-1 allele challenge the previously postulated role of the centrosome/spindle organizing center in chromosome pairing, and clearly support a role for MTF-1/SUN-1 in meiotic chromosome reorganization and in homolog recognition, possibly by mediating local aggregation of the ZYG-12 protein in meiotic nuclei.",M2
17543860,"SUN1 is required for telomere attachment to nuclear envelope and gametogenesis in mice.Prior to the pairing and recombination between homologous chromosomes during meiosis, telomeres attach to the nuclear envelope and form a transient cluster. However, the protein factors mediating meiotic telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope and the requirement of this attachment for homolog pairing and <e>synapsis</e> have not been determined in animals. Here we show that the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN1 specifically associates with telomeres between the leptotene and diplotene stages during meiotic prophase I. Disruption of Sun1 in mice prevents telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope, efficient homolog pairing, and synapsis formation in meiosis. Massive apoptotic events are induced in the mutant gonads, leading to the abolishment of both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. This study provides genetic evidence that SUN1-telomere interaction is essential for telomere dynamic movement and is required for efficient homologous chromosome pairing/synapsis during mammalian gametogenesis.",M2
17530928,"Zip4/Spo22 is required for class I CO formation but not for <e>synapsis</e> completion in Arabidopsis thaliana.In budding yeast meiosis, the formation of class I interference-sensitive crossovers requires the ZMM proteins. These ZMM proteins are essential in forming a mature synaptonemal complex, and a subset of these (Zip2, Zip3, and Zip4) has been proposed to compose the core of synapsis initiation complexes (SICs). Zip4/Spo22 functions with Zip2 to promote polymerization of Zip1 along chromosomes, making it a crucial SIC component. In higher eukaryotes, synapsis and recombination have often been correlated, but it is totally unknown how these two processes are linked. In this study, we present the characterization of a higher eukaryote SIC component homologue: Arabidopsis AtZIP4. We show that mutations in AtZIP4 belong to the same epistasis group as Atmsh4 and eliminate approximately 85% of crossovers (COs). Furthermore, genetic analyses on two adjacent intervals of Chromosome I established that the remaining COs in Atzip4 do not show interference. Lastly, immunolocalization studies showed that polymerization of the central element of the synaptonemal complex is not affected in Atzip4 background, even if it may proceed from fewer sites compared to wild type. These results reveal that Zip4 function in class I CO formation is conserved from budding yeast to Arabidopsis. On the other hand, and contrary to the situation in yeast, mutation in AtZIP4 does not prevent synapsis, showing that both aspects of the Zip4 function (i.e., class I CO maturation and synapsis) can be uncoupled.",M2
17507687,"Functional analysis of maize RAD51 in meiosis and double-strand break repair.In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad51p plays a central role in homologous recombination and the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Double mutants of the two Zea mays L. (maize) rad51 homologs are viable and develop well under normal conditions, but are male sterile and have substantially reduced seed set. Light microscopic analyses of male meiosis in these plants reveal reduced homologous pairing, <e>synapsis</e> of nonhomologous chromosomes, reduced bivalents at diakinesis, numerous chromosome breaks at anaphase I, and that &gt;33% of quartets carry cells that either lack an organized nucleolus or have two nucleoli. This indicates that RAD51 is required for efficient chromosome pairing and its absence results in nonhomologous pairing and synapsis. These phenotypes differ from those of an Arabidopsis rad51 mutant that exhibits completely disrupted chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis. Unexpectedly, surviving female gametes produced by maize rad51 double mutants are euploid and exhibit near-normal rates of meiotic crossovers. The finding that maize rad51 double mutant embryos are extremely susceptible to radiation-induced DSBs demonstrates a conserved role for RAD51 in the repair of mitotic DSBs in plants, vertebrates, and yeast.",M2
17470556,"Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of recombination signal sequence configuration in the RAG1/2 synaptic complex.A critical step in V(D)J recombination is the <e>synapsis</e> of complementary (12/23) recombination signal sequences (RSSs) by the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins to generate the paired complex (PC). Using a facilitated ligation assay and substrates that vary the helical phasing of the RSSs, we provide evidence that one particular geometric configuration of the RSSs is favored in the PC. To investigate this configuration further, we used fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) to detect the synapsis of fluorescently labeled RSS oligonucleotides. FRET requires an appropriate 12/23 RSS pair, a divalent metal ion, and high-mobility-group protein HMGB1 or HMGB2. Energy transfer between the RSSs was detected with all 12/23 RSS end positions of the fluorescent probes but was not detected when probes were placed on the two ends of the same RSS. Energy transfer was confirmed to originate from the PC by using an in-gel FRET assay. The results argue against a unique planar configuration of the RSSs in the PC and are most easily accommodated by models in which synapsed 12- and 23-RSSs are bent and cross one another, with implications for the organization of the RAG proteins and the DNA substrates at the time of cleavage.",M2

17337001,"Protein-induced local DNA bends regulate global topology of recombination products.The tyrosine family of recombinases produces two smaller DNA circles when acting on circular DNA harboring two recombination sites in head-to-tail orientation. If the substrate is supercoiled, these circles can be unlinked or form multiply linked catenanes. The topological complexity of the products varies strongly even for similar recombination systems. This dependence has been solved here. Our computer simulation of the <e>synapsis</e> showed that the bend angles, phi, created in isolated recombination sites by protein binding before assembly of the full complex, determine the product topology. To verify the validity of this theoretical finding we measured the values of phi for Cre/loxP and Flp/FRT systems. The measurement was based on cyclization of the protein-bound short DNA fragments in solution. Despite the striking similarity of the synapses for these recombinases, action of Cre on head-to-tail target sites produces mainly unlinked circles, while that of Flp yields multiply linked catenanes. In full agreement with theoretical expectations we found that the values of phi for these systems are very different, close to 35 degrees and 80 degrees, respectively. Our findings have general implications in how small protein machines acting locally on large DNA molecules exploit statistical properties of their substrates to bring about directed global changes in topology.",M2
17308890,"Effect of colchicine and telocentric chromosome conformation on centromere and telomere dynamics at meiotic prophase I in wheat-rye additions.Association of telomeres in a bouquet and clustering of centromere regions have been proposed to be involved in the search and recognition of homologous partners. We have analysed the role of these structures in meiotic chromosome pairing in wheat-rye addition lines by applying colchicine for disturbing presynaptic telomere movements and by modifying the centromere position from submetacentric to telocentric for studying centromere effects. Rye chromosomes, wheat and rye centromeres, and telomeres were identified by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Presynaptic association of centromeres in pairs or in more complex structures involved mainly non-homologous chromosomes as deduced from the behaviour of rye centromeres. While centromere association was not affected by colchicine, colchicine inhibited bouquet formation, which caused failure of homologous <e>synapsis</e>. Homologous centromeres of rye telocentrics associated earlier than those of rye submetacentric chromosomes, indicating that migration of the telocentrics' centromeres to the telomere pole during bouquet formation facilitated their association. Homologous chromosomes associated in premeiotic interphase can recognize each other and initiate synapsis at zygotene. However, telomere convergence is needed for bringing together the majority of homologous pairs that normally occupy separate territories in premeiotic nuclei.",M2
17298983,"Meiotic interference among MLH1 foci requires neither an intact axial element structure nor full <e>synapsis</e>.During meiosis, homologous chromosomes (homologs) perform reciprocal exchanges (crossovers) at a high frequency. Crossovers display interference, i.e. their spacing is more even than would be expected if they were placed randomly along the chromosomes. Concomitantly with crossover formation, synaptonemal complexes (SCs) appear between homologs: each chromosome forms an axial structure, the axial element (AE); the AEs of homologs align, and numerous transverse filaments connect the AEs to form an SC. Both the AE and the SC have been implicated in the imposition of interference. We investigated whether intact AEs or SCs are required for crossover interference in the mouse, using a mutant lacking AE protein SYCP3, which displays structurally abnormal AEs and incomplete synapsis. We estimated the level of interference from the spacing of immunofluorescent MLH1 foci, which mark almost all crossover sites in the mouse, along the SCs. The levels of interference among MLH1 foci in wild-type and Sycp3(-/-) mice were comparable, implying that neither an intact AE structure nor full synapsis is required for wild-type levels of interference.",M2

Recent evidence has shown that these sites in C. elegans have a role in synapsis. Here we compare the initiation of synapsis in organisms with specialized sites and those without. We propose that, early in prophase, synapsis requires an initiator to overcome inhibitory factors that function to prevent synaptonemal complex (SC) formation between nonhomologous sequences. These initiators of SC formation can be stimulated by crossover sites, possibly other types of recombination sites and also specialized sites where recombination does not occur.",M2

Whereas studies of Mre11 complex mutants in S. pombe and A. thaliana indicate that the complex has other essential meiotic roles , relatively little is known regarding the functions of the complex downstream of meiotic break formation and processing or its role in meiosis in higher eukaryotes. We analyzed meiotic events in mice harboring hypomorphic Mre11 and Nbs1 mutations which, unlike null mutants, support viability . Our studies revealed defects in the temporal progression of meiotic prophase, incomplete and aberrant synapsis of homologous chromosomes, persistence of strand exchange proteins, and alterations in both the frequency and placement of MLH1 foci, a marker of crossovers. A unique sex-dependent effect on MLH1 foci and chiasmata numbers was observed: males exhibited an increase and females a decrease in recombination levels. Thus, our findings implicate the Mre11 complex in meiotic DNA repair and synapsis in mammals and indicate that the complex may contribute to the establishment of normal sex-specific differences in meiosis.",M2
17141157,"A family of zinc-finger proteins is required for chromosome-specific pairing and <e>synapsis</e> during meiosis in C. elegans.Homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis are prerequisite for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis. Here, we show that a family of four related C2H2 zinc-finger proteins plays a central role in these events in C. elegans. These proteins are encoded within a tandem gene cluster. In addition to the X-specific HIM-8 protein, three additional paralogs collectively mediate the behavior of the five autosomes. Each chromosome relies on a specific member of the family to pair and synapse with its homolog. These  ZIM  proteins concentrate at special regions called meiotic pairing centers on the corresponding chromosomes. These sites are dispersed along the nuclear envelope during early meiotic prophase, suggesting a role analogous to the telomere-mediated meiotic bouquet in other organisms.

However, whether Lsh is involved in the regulation of chromatin-mediated processes during meiosis is not known. Here, we show that Lsh is essential for the completion of meiosis and transcriptional repression of repetitive elements in the female gonad. Oocytes from Lsh knockout mice exhibit demethylation of transposable elements and tandem repeats at pericentric heterochromatin, as well as incomplete chromosome synapsis associated with persistent RAD51 foci and gammaH2AX phosphorylation. Failure to load crossover-associated foci results in the generation of non-exchange chromosomes. The severe oocyte loss observed and lack of ovarian follicle formation, together with the patterns of Lsh nuclear compartmentalization in the germ line, demonstrate that Lsh has a critical and previously unidentified role in epigenetic gene silencing and maintenance of genomic stability during female meiosis.",M2
17002499,"Meiotic chromosome <e>synapsis</e>-promoting proteins antagonize the anti-crossover activity of sgs1.Sgs1, the budding yeast homolog of the mammalian BLM helicase, has been implicated in preventing excess recombination during both vegetative growth and meiosis. Most meiotic crossover (CO) recombination requires full function of a set of yeast proteins (Zip1, Zip2, Zip3, Zip4/Spo22, Mer3, Msh4, and Msh5, termed the SIC or ZMM proteins) that are also required for homologous chromosome synapsis. We report here genetic and molecular assays showing that sgs1 single mutants display relatively modest increases in CO recombination (less than 1.6-fold relative to wild-type). In contrast, a much greater CO increase is seen when an sgs1 mutation is introduced into the CO- and synapsis-deficient zip1, zip2, zip3, mer3, or msh4 mutants (2- to 8-fold increase). Furthermore, close juxtaposition of the axes of homologous chromosomes is restored. CO restoration in the mutants is not accompanied by significant changes in noncrossover (NCO) recombinant frequencies. These findings show that Sgs1 has potent meiotic anti-CO activity, which is normally antagonized by SIC/ZMM proteins. Our data reinforce previous proposals for an early separation of meiotic processes that form CO and NCO recombinants.",M2

The temporal and spatial expression of the two proteins were similar in wild-type rye, but with one notable difference. Unlike A. thaliana, in which foci of the transverse filament protein Zyp1 appear to linearize commensurately with <e>synapsis</e>, linear tracts of Asy1 and Zyp1 protein form independently at leptotene and early zygotene of rye and coalign into triple structures resembling synaptonemal complexes (SCs) only at later stages of synapsis. The sy10 mutant used in this study also forms spatially separate linear tracts of Asy1 and Zyp1 proteins at leptotene and early zygotene, and these coalign but do not form regular triple structures at midprophase. Electron microscopy of spread axial elements reveals extensive asynapsis with some exchanges of pairing partners. Indiscriminate SCs support nonhomologous chiasma formation at metaphase I, as revealed by multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization enabling reliable identification of all the chromosomes of the complement.

Incorrect assembly of this complex results in cell death, impaired meiotic recombination and formation of aneuploid germ cells. We have identified a novel mouse meiosis-specific protein, TEX12, and shown it to be a component of the central element structure of the synaptonemal complex at synapsed homologous chromosomes. Only two other central element proteins, SYCE1 and SYCE2, have been identified to date and, using several mouse knockout models, we show that these proteins and TEX12 specifically depend on the synaptonemal transverse filament protein SYCP1 for localization to the meiotic chromosomes. Additionally, we show that TEX12 exactly co-localized with SYCE2, having the same, often punctate, localization pattern. SYCE1, on the other hand, co-localized with SYCP1 and these proteins displayed the same more continuous expression pattern. These co-localization studies were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments that showed that TEX12 specifically co-precipitated with SYCE2. Our results suggest a molecular network within the central elements, in which TEX12 and SYCE2 form a complex that interacts with SYCE1. SYCE1 interacts more directly with SYCP1 and could thus anchor the central element proteins to the transverse filaments.",M2
16861745,"Synaptic defects at meiosis I and non-obstructive azoospermia.BACKGROUND: Recent advances in immunofluorescence methodology have made it possible to directly monitor protein localization patterns in germ cells undergoing meiosis.

METHODS: Specifically, we compared meiotic progression, <e>synapsis</e> and recombination in 34 individuals with obstructive azoospermia ('controls') to 26 individuals with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) ('cases'). RESULTS: In 9 of the 26 cases, no germ cells were identified, but in the remaining 17, there was at least some progression through meiosis. Most of these individuals appeared to have normal levels of spermatogenic activity, with little evidence of meiotic impairment. However, in three individuals, we observed either complete or partial meiotic arrest associated with abnormalities in synapsis. CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that &gt;10% of cases of unexplained NOA may be attributable to severe meiotic defects. The characterization of these meiotic arrest phenotypes may guide further research into the molecular basis of unexplained infertility.",M2
16782016,"A Role for SUMO in meiotic chromosome <e>synapsis</e>.During meiotic prophase, homologous chromosomes engage in a complex series of interactions that ensure their proper segregation at meiosis I. A central player in these interactions is the synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous structure elaborated along the lengths of paired homologs. In mutants that fail to make SC, crossing over is decreased, and chromosomes frequently fail to recombine; consequently, many meiotic products are inviable because of aneuploidy. Here, we have investigated the role of the small ubiquitin-like protein modifier (SUMO) in SC formation during meiosis in budding yeast. We show that SUMO localizes specifically to synapsed regions of meiotic chromosomes and that this localization depends on Zip1, a major building block of the SC. A non-null allele of the UBC9 gene, which encodes the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, impairs Zip1 polymerization along chromosomes. The Ubc9 protein localizes to meiotic chromosomes, coincident with SUMO staining. In the zip1 mutant, SUMO localizes to discrete foci on chromosomes. These foci coincide with axial associations, where proteins involved in synapsis initiation are located. Our data suggest a model in which SUMO modification of chromosomal proteins promotes polymerization of Zip1 along chromosomes. The ubc9 mutant phenotype provides the first evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship between sumoylation and synapsis.",M2

Although axial elements are formed normally, sister chromatid cohesion is established and recombination initiation appears to be unaffected in mutant plants, chromosomes do not synapse. During meiotic progression, a mass of entangled chromosomes, interconnected by chromatin bridges, and severe chromosome fragmentation are observed. These defects depend on the presence of SPO11-1, a protein that initiates recombination by catalysing DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the AtMND1 protein interacts with AHP2, the Arabidopsis protein closely related to budding yeast Hop2. These data demonstrate that AtMND1 plays a key role in homologous synapsis and in DSB repair during meiotic recombination.",M2

Each SC consists of two axial/lateral elements (AEs/LEs), and numerous transverse filaments. SC protein 2 (SYCP2) and SYCP3 are integral components of AEs/LEs in mammals. We find that SYCP2 forms heterodimers with SYCP3 both in vitro and in vivo. An evolutionarily conserved coiled coil domain in SYCP2 is required for binding to SYCP3. We generated a mutant Sycp2 allele in mice that lacks the coiled coil domain. The fertility of homozygous Sycp2 mutant mice is sexually dimorphic; males are sterile because of a block in meiosis, whereas females are subfertile with sharply reduced litter size. Sycp2 mutant spermatocytes exhibit failure in the formation of AEs and chromosomal synapsis. Strikingly, the mutant SYCP2 protein localizes to axial chromosomal cores in both spermatocytes and fetal oocytes, but SYCP3 does not, demonstrating that SYCP2 is a primary determinant of AEs/LEs and, thus, is required for the incorporation of SYCP3 into SCs.",M2
16710520,"Reproductive relationships and degree of <e>synapsis</e> in the polytene chromosomes of the Drosophila buzzatii species cluster.The process of speciation occurs through the evolution of any of several forms of reproductive isolation between taxa, including inviability of hybrids. In this work, strains derived from allopatric populations of Drosophila buzzatii cluster species were experimentally crossed in order to evaluate their reproductive and cytogenetic relationships, and to contribute toward understanding the reproductive isolation in this group of sibling species. Although intrastrain crosses were highly fertile, we consider it relevant to discuss the differences in intra- and interspecific fertility and fecundity here. Among 30 interspecific crosses, about 63% were partially or completely sterile. Fifty three percent of interspecific F1 crosses (female and male F1 crossed) were also partially or completely sterile, in contrast to only one out of 24 intraspecific F1 crosses that was partially sterile. An analysis of hybrid polytene chromosomes revealed complete synapsis, except in the microchromosomes (VI) and in the proximal region of the X chromosome. The intraspecific divergence observed in this study and the variable degree of chromosome pairing shown here reveal part of the complexity of the speciation process pertinent to Drosophila buzzatii cluster, which is consistent with different traits studied in this cluster.",M2
16570189,"From early homologue recognition to synaptonemal complex formation.This review focuses on various aspects of chromosome homology searching and their relationship to meiotic and vegetative pairing and to the silencing of unpaired copies of genes. Chromosome recognition and pairing is a prominent characteristic of meiosis; however, for some organisms, this association (complete or partial) is also a normal part of nuclear organization. The multiple mechanisms suggested to contribute to homologous pairing are analyzed. Recognition of DNA/DNA homology also plays an important role in detecting DNA segments that are present in inappropriate number of copies before and during meiosis. In this context, the mechanisms of methylation induced premeiotically, repeat-induced point mutation, meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA, and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation will be discussed. Homologue juxtaposition during meiotic prophase can be divided into three mechanistically distinct steps, namely, recognition, presynaptic alignment, and <e>synapsis</e> by the synaptonemal complex (SC). In most organisms, these three steps are distinguished by their dependence on DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The coupling of SC initiation to (and downstream effects of) DSB formation and the exceptions to this dependency are discussed. Finally, this review addresses the specific factors that appear to promote chromosome movement at various stages of meiotic prophase, most particularly at the bouquet stage, and on their significance for homologue pairing and/or achieving a final pachytene configuration.",M2
16544151,"Sex chromosomes, <e>synapsis</e>, and cohesins: a complex affair.During first meiotic prophase, homologous chromosomes are held together by the synaptonemal complex, a tripartite proteinaceous structure that extends along the entire length of meiotic bivalents. While this feature is applicable for autosomes, sex chromosomes often escape from this rule. Many species present sex chromosomes that differ between them in their morphology, length, and gene content. Moreover, in some species, sex chromosomes appear in a single dose in one of the sexes. In all of these cases, the behavior of sex chromosomes during meiosis is conspicuously affected, and this includes the assembly and dynamics of the synaptonemal complex. We review in this study the structure of the synaptonemal complex in the sex chromosomes of three groups of organisms, namely: mammals, orthopterans, and hemipterans, which present different patterns of sex chromosome structure and behavior. Of special interest is the analysis of the organization of the axial/lateral elements of the synaptonemal complex in relation to other axial structures organized along meiotic chromosomes, mainly the cohesin axis. The differences found in the behavior of both axial structures reveal that while the organization of a cohesin axis along sex chromosomes is a conserved feature in most organisms and it shows very little morphological variations, the axial/lateral elements of the synaptonemal complex present a wide range of structural modifications on these chromosomes.",M2
16543383,"Genetic analysis of chromosome pairing, recombination, and cell cycle control during first meiotic prophase in mammals.Meiosis is a double-division process that is preceded by only one DNA replication event to produce haploid gametes. The defining event in meiosis is prophase I, during which chromosome pairs locate each other, become physically connected, and exchange genetic information. Although many aspects of this process have been elucidated in lower organisms, there has been scant information available until now about the process in mammals. Recent advances in genetic analysis, especially in mice and humans, have revealed many genes that play essential roles in meiosis in mammals. These include cell cycle-regulatory proteins that couple the exit from the premeiotic DNA synthesis to the progression through prophase I, the chromosome structural proteins involved in <e>synapsis</e>, and the repair and recombination proteins that process the recombination events. Failure to adequately repair the DNA damage caused by recombination triggers meiotic checkpoints that result in ablation of the germ cells by apoptosis. These analyses have revealed surprising sexual dimorphism in the requirements of different gene products and a much less stringent checkpoint regulation in females. This may provide an explanation for the 10-fold increase in meiotic errors in females compared with males. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the use of genetic manipulation, particularly in mice, but also of the analysis of mutations in humans, to elucidate the mechanisms that are required for traverse through prophase I.",M2
16495306,"An azoospermic man with a double-strand DNA break-processing deficiency in the spermatocyte nuclei: case report.BACKGROUND: The mechanisms of meiotic arrest in human spermatogenesis are poorly known. METHODS AND RESULTS: A testicular biopsy from an azoospermic male showed complete spermatogenesis arrest at the spermatocyte stage, asynapsis, lack of formation of the XY body, partial reversion to a mitotic-like division and cell degeneration both at the prophase and at the abnormal cell divisions. Synaptonemal complex analysis showed minor segments of <e>synapsis</e> and mainly single axes. Fluorescent immunolocalization of meiotic proteins showed normal SYCP3, scarcity of SYCP1, null MLH1 foci, about 10 patches of gamma-H2AX, abnormal presence of BRCA1 among autosomal axes, absence of RAD51 in early and advanced spermatocytes and permanence of gamma-H2AX labelling up to the abnormal spermatocyte divisions that are the most advanced stage reached. There are at least six dominions of evenly packed chromatin resembling that of the normal XY body, but no true XY body. CONCLUSIONS: The protein phenotype and the fine structure of the nuclei are compatible with a deficiency of the processing of double-strand DNA breaks in the zygotene-like spermatocytes, but the features of this defect do not agree with Spo11, Sycp1, Atm and Dmc1 null mutations, which give absence of XY body, synapsis disturbances and spermatocyte apoptosis in mice.",M2
16488883,"Terminal DNA structure and ATP influence binding parameters of the DNA-dependent protein kinase at an early step prior to DNA <e>synapsis</e>.The DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) regulates the non-homologous end-joining pathway of DNA double-strand break repair in mammalian cells. The ability of DNA-PKcs to sense and respond to different terminal DNA structures is postulated to be important for its regulatory function. It is unclear whether discrimination occurs at the time of formation of the initial protein-DNA complex or later, at the time of formation of a paired, or synaptic complex between opposing DNA ends. To gain further insight into the mechanism of regulation, we characterized the binding of DNA-PKcs to immobilized DNA fragments that cannot undergo synapsis. Results showed that DNA-PKcs strongly discriminates between different terminal structures at the time of initial complex formation. Although Ku protein stabilizes DNA-PKcs binding overall, it is not required for discrimination between terminal structures. Base mispairing, temperature and the presence of an interstrand linkage influence the stability of the initial complex in a manner that suggests a requirement for DNA unwinding, reminiscent of the 'open complex' model of RNA polymerase-promoter DNA interaction. ATP and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog also influence the stability of the DNA-PKcs*DNA complex, apparently by an allosteric mechanism that does not require DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation.",M2
16484310,"Behaviour of human heterochromatic regions during the <e>synapsis</e> of homologous chromosomes.BACKGROUND: Alterations of synapsis can disturb or arrest meiosis and result in infertility. Synaptic abnormalities are frequently observed in infertile patients but also in fertile men. METHODS: The subtelomere-specific multiplex fluorescence in-situ hybridization (stM-FISH) has been applied in combination with immunofluorescence to identify all synaptonemal complexes (SCs) and to analyse those presenting synaptic anomalies in fertile and infertile men. RESULTS: SCs with heterochromatin blocks other than centromere (noncentromeric heterochromatin) presented a higher frequency of gaps (SC discontinuities) and splits (unsynapsed SC regions) at pachytene, the incidences for 9qh, 1qh, 15p and 21p being the highest ones. Inter-individual variability in the incidence of synaptic anomalies in these regions has been observed. In addition, synaptic anomalies in other SC regions are more frequent in infertile cases than in controls. Clear association of the SC15 and SC21 to the XY pair has been seen. CONCLUSION: Noncentromeric heterochromatic regions are the last to synapse. The inter-individual variation observed in the incidence of gaps and splits in these regions may be explained by the heteromorphism of these regions in the general population. The presence of synaptic anomalies in other SC regions may indicate nuclei with a severely affected synapsis. Noncentromeric heterochromatic regions might play a role in the association of autosomal SC15 and SC21 with the XY pair.",M2

16421735,"Chromosome <e>synapsis</e> in Arabidopsis: analysis of the transverse filament protein ZYP1 reveals novel functions for the synaptonemal complex.With respect to history, plants have provided an ideal system for cytogenetical analysis of the synaptonemal complex (SC). However, until recently, the identification of the genes that encode the SC in plants has proved elusive. In recent years, Arabidopsis thaliana was developed as a model system for plant meiosis research. As a result, there was substantial progress in the isolation of meiotic genes and this has recently led to the isolation of the first plant SC gene, ZYP1. The ZYP1 gene encodes a transverse filament (TF) protein that is predicted to have structural similarity to TF proteins found in other organisms. Analysis of plants deficient in ZYP1 expression has provided important insights into the function of the SC in plants. Loss of ZYP1 has only a limited effect on the overall level of recombination. However, it is associated with extensive nonhomologous recombination leading to multivalent formation at metaphase I. This phenomenon was not previously reported in other organisms. It is important to note that cytological analysis of the ZYP1 deficient lines indicates that SC formation is not required for the imposition of crossover interference.",M2
16410547,"PAIR2 is essential for homologous chromosome <e>synapsis</e> in rice meiosis I.The PAIR2 gene is required for homologous chromosome synapsis at meiosis I in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and encodes a HORMA-domain protein that is homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae HOP1 and Arabidopsis ASY1. Immunocytological and electron microscopic analyses indicate that PAIR2 proteins associate with axial elements (AEs) at leptotene and zygotene, and is removed from the AEs of arm regions when homologous chromosomes have been synapsed. Immunocytology against a centromeric histone H3 variant revealed that PAIR2 remains at centromeres until diakinesis, by which time the homologous centromeres had already been synapsed. However, neither precocious segregation of sister chromatids nor kinetochore dysfunction is observed, and AEs are normally assembled in the mutant. In the pair2-null mutant, homologous chromosome synapsis is completely eliminated. This study provides the first description of AE-associated protein in monocot plants and indicates that PAIR2 plays an essential role in promoting homologous chromosome synapsis. However, PAIR2 does not play a role in AE formation, sister chromatid cohesion at centromeres or kinetochore assembly in meiosis I of rice.",M2
