19227947,"Staff involvement key to satisfaction gains.One of the keys to achieving and maintaining high levels of patient satisfaction is to actively communicate with and involve your staff in patient safety initiatives, says the ED leadership at Boone County (<e>IA</e>) Hospital. Here are some of the strategies they use: The ED manager share Press Ganey results and comments regularly with the staff, Based on results and patient complaints, the staff determine what safety areas should be addressed for improvement, ED staff nurse will ask every discharged patient if they were pleased with their care, and will immediately address any complaints they raise.",M1
19196591,"Retrospective financial analysis of a herpes zoster vaccination program from an independent community pharmacy perspective.OBJECTIVE: To determine the net financial gain or loss for herpes zoster vaccination services provided to patients from the perspective of an independent community pharmacy. DESIGN: Retrospective review of pharmacy records over the program's initial 11-month period. SETTING: Independent community pharmacy in Iowa City, <e>IA</e>. PARTICIPANTS: Patients received immunization with the herpes zoster vaccine from a certified pharmacist. INTERVENTION: Herpes zoster vaccination services were provided to the patient and documented by the pharmacist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Net financial gains or losses were calculated for the herpes zoster vaccination program. Sensitivity analyses were based on costs that might be incurred during program start-up. RESULTS: 478 patients received zoster vaccination services over the initial 11-month period. A net financial gain for the herpes zoster vaccination program was achieved, with a net profit of $15.02, or 8.15%, per vaccination. CONCLUSION: Revenues for this vaccination program exceeded its costs from the independent community pharmacy perspective.",M1

18047216,"Spatiotemporal investigation of adult mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) populations in an eastern Iowa county, USA.Landscape and climatic factors regulate distributions of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) over time and space. The anthropogenic control of mosquito populations is often carried out at a local administrative scale, and it is applied based on the relevant agency's experiential knowledge rather than systematic analysis of spatial and temporal data. To address this shortcoming, a spatial and temporal analysis of landscape and climatic parameters in relation to mosquito populations in Black Hawk County, <e>IA</e>, USA, has been carried out. Adult mosquito sampling took place using CDC light traps from May to August 2003 in representative landscapes. Mosquitoes were identified to species level with Aedes trivittatus (Coquillet) and Aedes vexans (Meigen) dominating the collection totals. The best publicly available spatial data on landscape and demographic attributes were collated and included land cover, human census, soils, floodplain, elevation, wetlands, hydrography, roads, and vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery. Spatial processing was carried out to organize landscape attributes for statistical comparison with abundance data from the potentially important West Nile virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, WNV) vector species Ae. vexans and Ae. trivittatus. Landscape parameters shown to be significantly correlated with mosquito counts included soil hydrological properties, presence in floodplain, wetland areas, and deciduous and bottomland forest cover. Data on temperature and precipitation were used to investigate the climatic influence on the temporal occurrence of mosquito population abundances. Late spring rain provided ample moisture for mosquito development, but low temperatures delayed widespread emergence of Ae. trivittatus and Ae. vexans until June 2003. Landscape and climatic impacts on adult mosquito population distributions were demonstrated, and these results could form the basis for the development of a spatiotemporal modeling framework that would inform anthropogenic mosquito control anld vector-borne disease surveillance. A qualitative discussion concerning Culex pipiens (L.) and Culex restuans Theobald is included.",M1
17969677,"State-level infrastructure and economic effects of switchgrass cofiring with coal in existing power plants for carbon mitigation.This paper presents a linear programming (LP) methodology for estimating the cost of reducing a state's coal-fired power plant carbon dioxide emissions by cofiring switchgrass and coal. LP modeling allows interplay between regionally specific switchgrass production forecasts, coal plant locations, and individual coal plant historic performance data to determine an allocation of switchgrass minimizing cost or maximizing carbon reduction. The LP methodology is applied to two states, Pennsylvania (PA) and Iowa (<e>IA</e>), and results are presented with a discussion of modeling assumptions, techniques, and carbon mitigation policy implications. The LP methodology estimates that, in PA, 4.9 million tons of CO2/year could be mitigated at an average cost of less than $34/ton of CO2 and that, in IA, 7 million tons of CO2/year could be mitigated at an average Cost of Mitigation of $27/ton of CO2. Because the factors determining the cofiring costs vary so much between the two states, results suggest that cofiring costs will also vary considerably between different U.S. regions. A national level analysis could suggest a lowest-cost cofiring region. This paper presents techniques and assumptions that can simplify biomass energy policy analysis with little effect on analysis conclusions.",M1

DeGowin, MD, like many of the pioneers of American blood banking and transfusion medicine, entered the discipline because of scientific curiosity and a desire to provide efficacious and safe allogeneic transfusions to patients. Much of the early impetus and financial support were fueled by the military needs of World War II. Dr. DeGowin and his colleagues provided important information pertaining to the preservation, storage, transportation, and transfusion of blood. After the war, many of these investigations continued and were applied to civilian practices.

16295268,"Evaluating speed differences between passenger vehicles and heavy trucks for transportation-related emissions modeling.Heavy-duty trucks make up only 3% of the on-road vehicle fleet, yet they account for &gt; 7% of vehicle miles traveled in the United States. They also contribute a significant proportion of regulated ambient emissions. Heavy vehicles emit emissions at different rates than passenger vehicles. They may also behave differently on-road, yet may be treated similarly to passenger vehicles in emissions modeling. Input variables to the MOBILE software, such as average vehicle speed, are typically specified the same for heavy trucks as for passenger vehicles. Although not frequently considered in modeling emissions, speed differences between passenger vehicles and heavy trucks may influence emissions, because emission rates are correlated to average speed. Differences were evaluated by collecting average and spot speeds for heavy trucks and passenger vehicles on arterials and spot speeds on freeways in Des Moines, <e>IA</e>, and Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN. Speeds were compared by study site. Space mean speeds for heavy trucks were lower than passenger vehicle speeds for all of the arterials with differences ranging from 0.8 to 19 mph. Spot speeds for heavy trucks were also lower at all of the arterial and freeway locations with differences ranging from 0.8 to 6.1 mph. The impact that differences in on-road speeds had on emissions was also evaluated using MOBILE version 6.2. Misspecification of average truck speed is the most significant at lower and higher speed ranges.",M1

In December, MMC adopted a biannual reporting cycle for community benefit activities. Such reporting was facilitated by putting it online. More recently, MMC has begun publicizing its community benefit activities. As a result, both the facility's staff and the community have gained a clearer idea of the services that MMC provides in north Iowa.",M1
15218927,"Vector competence of Culex tarsalis (Diptera: Culicidae) from Iowa for a sympatric strain of western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE-7738) virus.Experiments were designed to evaluate the vector competence of Culex tarsalis Coquillet from an area (Sioux City) where Cx. tarsalis is most abundant in Iowa for western equine encephalomyelitis virus (WEE-7738). WEE-7738 was isolated from Aedes trivittatus (Coquillet) collected in Ames, <e>IA</e>, in 1977. Infection rate, dissemination rate, multiplication efficiency, and transmission rate were determined for this virus in the SC strain of Cx. tarsalis. SC strain of Cx. tarsalis was as susceptible to WEE-7738 as Californian strains of Cx. tarsalis were to BFS1703 strain of WEE; OID50 of SC Cx. tarsalis was 2.63 log TCID50 per mosquito and OID50 of Californian strains of Cx. tarsalis were 2.0-4.1 log PFU per mosquito.

METHODS: All OMSITE scores for residents in their last years of training during the years 1992 to 1998 and their scores on the ABOMS WQE were tabulated by American College Testing (ACT) (Iowa City, <e>IA</e>) and submitted for analysis. The data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficients to determine any relationship between the 2 scores. Likelihood ratios were calculated to show the probability of candidates passing the ABOMS WQE based on their OMSITE score. RESULTS: There were 765 scores provided by ACT for the years 1992 to 1998. A significantly positive correlation existed between the OMSITE and ABOMS WQE raw scores for those taking the ABOMS WQE for the first and second times, but not for subsequent attempts. Persons who scored a raw score of over 211 on the OMSITE all passed the ABOMS WQE on their first attempt. Those with a raw score of less than 134 on their OMSITE all failed the ABOMS WQE on their first attempt. CONCLUSION: A highly positive correlation exists between candidate performance on the OMSITE and the ABOMS WQE.",M1
10395854,"Regional dissemination of vancomycin-resistant enterococci resulting from interfacility transfer of colonized patients.During early 1997, the Siouxland District Health Department (SDHD; Sioux City, <e>IA</e>) reported an increased incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) isolates at area health care facilities. To determine the prevalence and risk factors for colonization with VRE strains at 32 health care facilities in the SDHD region, a prevalence survey and case-control study were performed. Of 2266 patients and residents, 1934 (85%) participated, and 40 (2.1%) were positive for (gastrointestinal) VRE colonization. The prevalence of VRE isolates was significantly higher in acute care facilities (ACFs) than in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) (10/152 [6.6%] vs. 30/1782 [1.7%]; odds ratio [OR], 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-9.0). LTCF case patients were significantly more likely than controls to have been inpatients at any ACF (19/30 vs. 12/66; OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 2.7-23.8). Of 40 VRE isolates, 34 (85%) were a related strain. The predominant strain was present in all 12 LTCFs that had at least 1 case patient in each facility. Soon after the introduction of VRE isolates into this region, dissemination to multiple LTCFs resulted from resident transfer from ACFs to LTCFs.",M1

9460180,"Serum levels of several organochlorine pesticides in farmers correspond with dietary exposure and local use history.In response to reported increased cancer risks among farmers, the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) was designed to examine health outcomes and environmental exposures among farm families in the United States. In the pilot phase of the AHS, food, beverage, air, dermal, dust, surface wipe, and biological specimens (blood and urine) were collected and analyzed for six farm families in two states (<e>IA</e> and NC). In addition, questionnaires were administered to examine previous pesticide use. This paper reports the organochlorine pesticide results of the serum and dietary analyses as well as questionnaire results from the pilot exposure study of farmers and their families. Note, no organochlorine pesticides were reported as currently being applied to the study farms. In all human serum samples examined, typical U.S. population levels were found for the majority of the pesticides. In addition, human serum levels of organochlorine pesticides showed no significant daily or seasonal variation. However, serum trans-nonachlor levels were found to be higher in people living on the two farms in North Carolina than in people living on the four farms in Iowa (p &lt; 0.05). Further, unusually high dieldrin levels were found in serum samples from a farmer and spouse living on an Iowa farm, and these levels were significantly higher than those of people living on the other farms (p &lt; 0.05). Dieldrin was persistent in the foods consumed on the same Iowa farm where family members showed elevated serum levels. In addition, dietary samples from the North Carolina farms exhibited high levels of chlordane. No organochlorine pesticides were found in any of the drinking water samples. Dietary dieldrin levels on the same Iowa farm exceeded the oral reference dose (RfD) eight- to eleven-fold (50 ng/kg-day). No other pesticide exceeded the RfD. However, dietary chlordane levels at a North Carolina farm reached 17% of the RfD. Previous use of aldrin on an Iowa farm corresponded to dieldrin found in the diet and in the serum of the farmer and spouse. Previous reported use of chlordane on the North Carolina farms corresponded with measurable dietary levels of chlordance and higher serum trans-nonachlor levels than the levels in Iowa farm families.",M1
9220040,"Pharmacoepidemiology of urinary tract infections in Iowa Medicaid patients in urban long-term-care facilities.OBJECTIVE: To describe the therapeutic management of Medicaid patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in urban long-term-care facilities (LTCFs) and to link individual therapies to patient outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective review of medical records in LTCFs of patients who had documented UTIs. METHODS: Patient data were collected from 17 LTCFs in the Des Moines, <e>IA</e>, metropolitan area during a 1-year period starting January 1, 1995. Patients with UTIs were selected from the LTCF infection control logs. Data collected on patients included demographics, concomitant diseases, type of UTI (i.e., symptomatic, asymptomatic, catheter-related), process measures for management, UTI treatment, patient outcomes, and follow-up. Patient outcome data were defined as either cure or no cure. A UTI cure was defined as a negative urine culture while taking antibiotic therapy and/or complete resolution of signs and symptoms, as well as no further treatment given within 2 weeks after the end of treatment. RESULTS: Data were collected on 310 patients who had at least one UTI over the 1-year study period. Patients were primarily elderly (mean age 82.2 +/- 12.3 y), white (95.1%), and female (83.9%). Concomitant diseases were common and about one-fourth (23.0%) of the patients were catheterized. There were 536 UTI events (the unit of analysis) documented over the 1-year period, with about one-half (45.9%) being UTIs with symptoms consistent with uncomplicated lower UTI. Nearly two-thirds (62.3%) of the patients were cured, based on the study definition; there was no association between cure and type of antimicrobial therapy (p = 0.99). Over one-third (35.2%) of the UTIs were treated with a quinolone antibiotic. Others were treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (24.4%), nitrofurantoin (13.9%), cephalosporin (10.4%), or ampicillin/amoxicillin (9.8%). Sixty-day follow-up showed no association between type of therapy and hospital readmission, physician follow-up visits, or subsequent UTIs. CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in cure rates when comparing LTCF UTI patients receiving various regimens. With outcomes being the same, the clinician should closely consider costs of drug therapy in selecting a treatment preference.",M1

8341778,"Risk factors for septicemia-associated mortality in older adults.Septicemia is the 10th leading cause of death among older adults in the United States; its mortality rate has steadily increased over the past decades. Little is known about factors which predispose to septicemia mortality in the elderly. The authors investigated risk factors for septicemia-associated mortality in 10,269 older adults as part of a longitudinal study of three communities (East Boston, MA; New Haven, CT; and Iowa and Washington Counties, <e>IA</e>). During 6 years of followup, 177 persons (3.2 per 1,000 person-years) had septicemia ICD9 038 (International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision) reported on their death certificate. In a multivariate proportional-hazards model, septicemia mortality was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) and independently associated with age, male sex, history of diabetes, history of cancer requiring hospitalization, smoking one pack of cigarettes per day or more, not drinking alcohol in the year prior to baseline, disability in activities of daily living, cognitive impairment, and missing cognitive testing score. These factors might be useful in developing an at-risk population for testing septicemia treatment or prevention strategies in a community setting. Further investigation is needed to explain underlying mechanisms of increased risk of subsequent septicemia.",M1
10124306,"Mental healthcare for rural seniors. An outreach program in Cedar Rapids, <e>IA</e>, uses an integrated approach to break down barriers to care.Several barriers prevent elderly persons, especially those living in rural areas, from receiving mental health services. The Abbe Center for Community Mental Health is breaking down some of these barriers in the Cedar Rapids, IA, area. The center's Elderly Outreach Project identifies and provides mental health services to the area's rural elderly. A multidisciplinary team (psychiatrist, nurse, and social worker) assesses and treats home-bound clients. Four major barriers prevent seniors from using traditional mental healthcare services: A lack of trained professionals. Because many professionals have not received training in geriatrics, those working with elderly clients should be encouraged to attend educational conferences to fill gaps in their knowledge. Organizational barriers. Transportation and cost may prohibit elderly persons from seeking mental healthcare. Facilities must revise policies detrimental to clients' well-being. Ageism. Many elderly persons have internalized negative and incorrect beliefs about what aging is or should be. Education about  normal  aging is essential. Stigma. The stigma of mental illness is particularly troublesome. Services such as in-home counseling allow clients to get the help they need while keeping their mental illness confidential. To eliminate the barriers to mental healthcare, increased financial resources are necessary to develop, implement, and maintain innovative programs that can reach frail, isolated, hard-to-find persons in need of mental health, medical, and social services.",M1
1480401,"Functional blindness and visual impairment in older adults from three communities.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine the association of sociodemographic factors with functional blindness and visual impairment in an aged population. METHODS: Three population-based cohorts (East Boston, MA; New Haven, CT; and Iowa and Washington Counties, <e>IA</e>) of persons aged 71 years and older were screened for bilateral functional near and distant vision during an in-home interview in 1988. RESULTS: Screening was completed by 5335 participants. The prevalence of functional blindness increased with age, from 1% at age 71 to 74 years to 17% in those 90 years of age and older. Functional visual impairment increased from 7% at age 71 to 74 years to 39% in those 90 years of age and older. In multivariate analyses, residence in a nursing home, older age, glaucoma, insulin-requiring diabetes at baseline, East Boston site, history of cataract, and lower 1982 income were independent and significantly associated with both functional blindness and visual impairment. Age and nursing home residence were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) more strongly associated with blindness (odds ratios 4.8 and 6.1, respectively) than they were with visual impairment. CONCLUSION: Functional blindness and visual impairment are quite prevalent among the oldest old and the institutionalized. The number of affected individuals will increase as the population ages and life expectancy increases. Although visual problems are associated with aging, nursing home residence, health problems, and socioeconomic conditions, they may be readily remediable and may lead to immediate improvements in quality of life.",M1

10311131,"Feeding policy protects patients' rights, decisions.In adopting a policy to guide patients and care givers in treatment decisions, the Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and Infirm, Davenport, <e>IA</e>, have taken an important step toward resolving issues related to force-feeding. The policy enables residents of Kahl Home for the Aged and Infirm to discuss their future health care with relatives and physicians while they are competent. It also establishes guidelines concerning the insertion of feeding tubes and provides for periodic evaluation of residents' feeding needs. Formulating such a policy, of course, requires consideration of the ethical assumptions underlying decisions to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining therapy. It requires an understanding of the difference between a diminished capacity to pursue life's ends and the complete inability to do so when a person is permanently comatose. this difference affects the decision as to whether it is time to allow one to die--a decision that should precede the medical decision to withhold or withdraw treatment. For example, to present as an option the removal of feeding tubes and intravenous equipment when a patient is brain dead is poor medicine and bad ethics. The patient is dead; thus no choice exists whether to end treatment. Despite objections to decision making based on quality-of-life criteria, this concept--when related to a person's ability to pursue life's temporal goals--is critical to good decision making and allows decision makers to avoid arbitrary judgments in determining when it is time to let a person die.",M1

This trial primarily evaluated toxicity and estimated the maximum tolerated dose of intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) melphalan, IA carboplatin, and intravenous (IV) etoposide phosphate in conjunction with blood-brain barrier disruption in these tumors. The secondary measure was efficacy. METHODS: Thirteen patients with temozolomide-refractory anaplastic oligodendroglioma (11 patients) or oligoastrocytoma (2 patients) underwent blood-brain barrier disruption with carboplatin (IA, 200 mg/m(2)/d), etoposide phosphate (IV, 200 mg/m(2)/d), and melphalan (IA, dose escalation) every 4 weeks, for up to 1 year. Patients underwent melphalan dose escalation (4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 mg/m(2)/d) until the maximum tolerated dose (1 level below that producing grade 4 toxicity) was determined. Toxicity and efficacy were assessed. RESULTS: Two of 4 patients receiving IA melphalan at 8 mg/m(2)/d developed grade 4 thrombocytopenia; thus, the melphalan maximum tolerated dose was 4 mg/m/d. Adverse events included asymptomatic subintimal tear (1 patient) and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (3 patients). Two patients demonstrated complete response, 3 had partial responses, 5 demonstrated stable disease, and 3 progressed. Median overall progression-free survival was 11 months. Patients with complete or partial response demonstrated deletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q. In the 5 patients with stable disease, 2 demonstrated 1p and 19q deletion, and 3 demonstrated 19q deletion only. CONCLUSION: In patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma tumors in whom temozolomide treatment has failed, osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption with IA carboplatin, IV etoposide phosphate, and IA melphalan (4 mg/m(2)/d for 2 days) shows acceptable toxicity and encouraging efficacy, especially in patients demonstrating 1p and/or 19q deletion.",M2
19888287,"Effects of administration route on migration and distribution of neural progenitor cells transplanted into rats with focal cerebral ischemia, an MRI study.We tested the hypotheses that administration routes affect the migration and distribution of grafted neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the ischemic brain and that the ischemic lesion plays a role in mediating the grafting process. Male Wistar rats (n=41) were subjected to 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), followed 1 day later by administration of magnetically labeled NPCs. Rats with MCAo were assigned to one of three treatment groups targeted for cell transplantation intra-arterially (<e>IA</e>), intracisternally (IC), or intravenously (IV). MRI measurements consisting of T2-weighted imaging and three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo imaging were performed 24 h after MCAo, 4 h after cell injection, and once a day for 4 days. Prussian blue staining was used to identify the labeled cells, 3D MRI to detect cell migration and distribution, and T2 map to assess lesion volumes. Intra-arterial (IA) administration showed significantly increased migration, a far more diffuse distribution pattern, and a larger number of transplanted NPCs in the target brain than IC or IV administration. However, high mortality with IA delivery (IA: 41%; IC: 17%; IV: 8%) poses a serious concern for using this route of administration.

How the timing of IV rt-PA initiation relates to timing of restoration of blood flow has been unclear. An understanding of the relationship between timing of angiographic reperfusion and clinical outcome is needed to establish time parameters for intraarterial (<e>IA</e>) therapies. METHODS: The Interventional Management of Stroke pilot trials tested combined IV/IA therapy for moderate-to-severe ischemic strokes within 3 hours from symptom onset. To isolate the effect of time to angiographic reperfusion on clinical outcome, we analyzed only middle cerebral artery and distal internal carotid artery occlusions with successful reperfusion (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2-3) during the interventional procedure (&lt;7 hours). Time to angiographic reperfusion was defined as time from stroke onset to procedure termination. Good clinical outcome was defined as modified Rankin Score 0-2 at 3 months. RESULTS: Among the 54 cases, only time to angiographic reperfusion and age independently predicted good clinical outcome after angiographic reperfusion. The probability of good clinical outcome decreased as time to angiographic reperfusion increased (unadjusted p = 0.02, adjusted p = 0.01) and approached that of cases without angiographic reperfusion within 7 hours. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that good clinical outcome following angiographically successful reperfusion is significantly time-dependent. At later times, angiographic reperfusion may be associated with a poor risk-benefit ratio in unselected patients.",M2

19277904,"IV vs. <e>IA</e> TPA in acute ischemic stroke with CT angiographic evidence of major vessel occlusion: a feasibility study.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies suggest that stroke patients with thrombus in a major cerebral vessel respond less favorably to intravenous (IV) thrombolysis. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a protocol comparing IV versus intra-arterial (IA) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in an acute ischemic stroke with major vessel occlusion. METHODS: Consecutive ischemic stroke patients presenting &lt;3 h from symptom onset with major vessel occlusion on CT angiogram (CTA) were randomly assigned to IV TPA (per NINDS protocol) or IA TPA (22 mg over 2 h). Demographics, times to presentation and thrombolysis, presenting NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) and 90-day NIHSS, Barthel Index, and modified Rankin Scale were recorded. CT-scans at 24-h were reviewed for presence of hemorrhage. Recanalization was determined by post-procedure MR angiograms, which are obtained the day after thrombolytic therapy. RESULTS: Seven patients (median NIHSS = 16) were randomized to IV (N = 4) or IA (N = 3) TPA. There were no significant differences in the presentation NIHSS, time to presentation, or time to treatment between the two groups. Hemorrhage was noted in one patient in the IA group (asymptomatic) and one patient in the IV group (symptomatic). Recanalization was seen in all patients treated with IA TPA and none treated with IV TPA (P = 0.03, Fisher's Exact test). CONCLUSIONS: We found that it is feasible to conduct a trial comparing IV vs. IA TPA in ischemic stroke patients with major vessel occlusion presenting &lt;3 h from onset. Patients treated with IA TPA showed a trend toward higher rate of recanalization. A larger trial may be designed to test safety and effectiveness of IA TPA in this specific group of stroke patients.",M2
19218803,"Risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in patients treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis.BACKGROUND: In intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) thrombolysis trials, higher rates of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH) were found than in trials with intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA); this observation could have been due to the inclusion of more severely affected patients in IA thrombolysis trials. In the present study, we investigated the rate of sICH in IA and combined IV + IA thrombolysis versus IV thrombolysis after adjusting for differences in clinical and MRI parameters. METHODS: In this multicenter study, we systematically analyzed data from 645 patients with anterior-circulation strokes treated with either IV or IA thrombolysis within 6 h following symptom onset. Thrombolytic regimens included (1) IV tPA treatment (n = 536) and (2) IA treatment with either tPA or urokinase (n = 74) or (3) combined IV + IA treatment with either tPA or urokinase (n = 35). RESULTS: 44 (6.8%) patients developed sICH. sICH patients had significantly higher scores on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at admission and pretreatment DWI lesions. The sICH risk was 5.2% (n = 28) in IV thrombolysis, which is significantly lower than in IA (12.5%, n = 9) or IV + IA thrombolysis (20%, n = 7). In a binary logistic regression analysis including age, NIHSS score, time to thrombolysis, initial diffusion weighted imaging lesion size, mode of thrombolytic treatment and thrombolytic agent, the mode of thrombolytic treatment remained an independent predictor for sICH. The odds ratio for IA or IV + IA versus IV treatment was 3.466 (1.19-10.01, 95% CI, p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this series, IA and IV + IA thrombolysis is associated with an increased sICH risk as compared to IV thrombolysis, and this risk is independent of differences in baseline parameters such as age, initial NIHSS score or pretreatment lesion size.",M2
19213819,"Multi-detector row CT angiography with direct intra-arterial contrast injection for the evaluation of neurovascular disease: technique, applications, and initial experience.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of 64-section multi-detector row CT angiography (CTA) with direct intra-arterial contrast injection (<e>IA</e>-CTA) for the evaluation of neurovascular disease. This technique was used in 11 patients at our institution. All studies were technically successful, and there were no complications. Small vascular malformations were mapped easily on high-resolution IA-CTA images, enabling microsurgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery. In a similar fashion, additional morphologic features were revealed on IA-CTA images not seen on standard 2D and 3D digital subtraction angiography. Of 11 patients undergoing IA-CTA, 7 patients had further anatomic clarity of the small arteriovenous fistula/malformation and 4 patients had changes in the treatment plan on the basis of the IA-CTA findings.",M2
19057319,"Angiographic and hemodynamic effect of high concentration of intra-arterial nicardipine in cerebral vasospasm.OBJECTIVE: Nicardipine has been used to treat cerebral vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) infusion of high concentrations of nicardipine decreases procedure time, but it may affect hemodynamic parameters. In addition, a quantitative measurement of improvement of vessel diameter on the angiograms has not been performed. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective database analysis of consecutive patients with symptomatic vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who failed medical management and received IA nicardipine between September 2005 and June 2006. Nicardipine (1 mg/mL/min) was infused intra-arterially by microcatheter. Blood pressure, heart rate, and intracranial pressure were recorded during the infusion. The effect of IA nicardipine on the vessel's diameter was measured on angiography by two blinded investigators. RESULTS: Forty-six treatment sessions were performed in 22 consecutive patients (13 women; age, 56.4 +/-13 years). Fourteen patients received IA nicardipine alone, and 8 patients had additional angioplasty. The average nicardipine dose was 12 +/- 10 mg (range, 2-25 mg). The mean decrease of systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure was 17.4 +/- 18.3 mm Hg, 7.7 +/- 10.4 mm Hg, and 10.9 +/- 11.6 mm Hg, respectively. There was no change in intracranial pressure. Measurement of 49 vessels in the 14 patients treated with nicardipine alone showed a significant increase in arterial diameters (range, 1-74%; P &lt; 0.0001). At the time of discharge, 11 patients (50%) were functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2). CONCLUSION: High concentrations of IA nicardipine infusion have a reversible effect on blood pressure and heart rate. IA nicardipine results also in a significant improvement in vessel diameter in patients with vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.",M2
18758913,"Primary meningeal CNS lymphoma treated with intra-arterial chemotherapy and blood-brain barrier disruption.Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the meninges is a particularly rare form of primary CNS lymphoma. We report a case of a 63-year-old woman found to have primary meningeal lymphoma (PML) with dural and leptomeningeal involvement whom we treated with multiple cycles of intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) methotrexate, intravenous (IV) etoposide phosphate, and IV cyclophosphamide after reversible osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD). Improvement was evident on gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI one month into therapy. At 67 months post-diagnosis there is no evidence of CNS disease. After completing her therapy regimen, she remained disease-free for 34 months, when stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was discovered in her left adrenal gland and right thigh. Following six cycles of rituximab and CHOP treatment, she is presently in complete remission. IA methotrexate and reversible osmotic BBBD without radiation therapy may be an effective therapy for treating PML.",M2
18727931,"Intra-arterial transplantation of bone marrow mononuclear cells immediately after reperfusion decreases brain injury after focal ischemia in rats.AIMS: Transplantation of bone marrow cells has been reported to exert neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia. However, the effect of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) administered immediately after reperfusion has rarely been investigated. The present study was designed to examine whether brain injury in response to transient focal ischemia can be ameliorated by BMMC administration immediately after reperfusion in rats, and to determine whether there are differences in the route of administration. MAIN METHODS: Autologous BMMCs were obtained from each rat. Rats were then subjected to transient focal ischemia followed by BMMC administration via the ipsilateral carotid artery (<e>IA</e> group) or the femoral vein (IV group) immediately after reperfusion. Control rats underwent the same procedure but received vehicle injection. Infarct volume was compared among the groups 24 h and 7 days after reperfusion. BMMCs were fluorescently labeled with PKH26 prior to administration to track transplanted cells. KEY FINDINGS: Total infarct volume decreased in the IA group, but not in the IV group, when compared to the vehicle group. In the ipsilateral hemisphere, PKH26 positive cell count was greater in the IA group than in the IV group. Motor function, assessed with a rotarod test, improved in the IA group compared to the vehicle group. SIGNIFICANCE: These results show significant neuroprotection after transient focal ischemia by 1 x 10(7) autologous BMMCs administered intra-arterially, but not intravenously, immediately after reperfusion in rats. The larger number of transplanted BMMCs in the brain during the early stage of reperfusion may be responsible for the protective effect.",M2
18559353,"Pharmacokinetics of artesunate in the domestic pig.OBJECTIVES: The aim was to study the pharmacokinetic profile of artesunate and its metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in a pig model. METHODS: Thirteen pigs received either intravenous (iv) or intramuscular (im) artesunate (60 mg), with the alternative preparation given 24 h later in an open crossover design. Five of them also received an additional intra-arterial (<e>ia</e>) artesunate dose (60 mg). The plasma concentrations of artesunate and DHA were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Population modelling was performed with NONMEM, using a two-compartment model. RESULTS: Plasma concentration-time profiles were comparable to those observed in humans, with a rapid and biphasic decline for both artesunate and DHA. Following an iv bolus, artesunate had a median maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of 13.8 microM [interquartile range (IQR), 10.4-22.1 microM], elimination half-life (t(1/2)) = 18 min (IQR, 16-22 min), total plasma clearance (CL) = 5.58 L/h/kg (IQR, 3.31-5.91 L/h/kg) and volume of distribution (V(d)) = 1.85 L/kg (IQR, 1.27-3.20 L/kg). The median C(max) value for DHA was 3.30 microM (IQR, 2.08-5.95 microM), t(1/2) = 26 min (IQR, 23-31 min), CL/Fm = 4.37 L/h/kg (IQR, 3.29-6.87 L/h/kg) and V(d)/Fm = 2.56 L/kg (IQR, 1.93-4.49 L/kg). Artesunate and DHA pharmacokinetic parameters were similar after ia administration. Following im dosing, median artesunate C(max) was 4.81 microM (IQR, 3.74-5.40 microM), t(1/2) = 18 min (IQR, 16-28 min), CL = 4.37 L/h/kg (IQR, 4.13-4.68 L/h/kg) and V(d) = 2.07 L/kg (IQR, 1.83-2.79 L/kg); the bioavailability was 100%. For DHA, median C(max) was 1.43 microM (IQR, 1.00-1.92 microM), t(1/2) = 27 min (IQR, 25-37 min), CL/Fm = 4.68 L/h/kg (IQR, 3.35-6.73 L/h/kg) and V(d)/Fm = 3.31 L/kg (IQR, 2.89-4.27 L/kg). CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetic properties of artesunate and DHA in pigs were similar to those reported in humans, suggesting that the swine model is suitable for determining the preclinical pharmacokinetics of artemisinin derivatives.",M2
18520544,"Superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy for advanced maxillary sinus cancer: an evaluation of arterial perfusion with computed tomographic arteriography and of tumor response.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to elucidate the relationship between arterial perfusion in advanced maxillary sinus cancer which was opacified by superselective intra-arterial computed tomographic arteriography (<e>IA</e>-CTA) and the tumor response to intra-arterial chemotherapy. METHODS: Superselective IA-CTA was performed to identify the feeding arteries and their perfusion in advanced maxillary sinus cancer in 10 patients. Cisplatin was selectively infused into these feeding arteries, except for the internal carotid artery. RESULTS: The results were assessed in 9 of the 10 patients, and a complete response was achieved in 5 patients in whom either the entire tumor, or most of the tumor, was perfused by the branches of the external carotid artery. In 4 patients with a partial response, the residual tumors were seen in the territory of the perfusion defect or in the perfusion territory of the internal carotid artery. CONCLUSION: Superselective IA-CTA is a useful technique to correctly identify the intratumoral perfusion and to predict tumor response to the intra-arterial chemotherapy of advanced maxillary sinus cancer.",M2
18340411,"Combined intravenous and intraarterial revascularization therapy using MRI perfusion/diffusion mismatch selection for acute ischemic stroke at 3-6 h after symptom onset.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravenous (IV) thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes in a 3-6 h window in patients selected with perfusion/diffusion mismatch. However, the advantages of combined IV and intraarterial (<e>IA</e>) thrombolysis after 3 h of stroke onset are unexplored. METHODS: Acute ischemic stroke patients with persistent occlusion of intracranial large arteries were screened prospectively for thrombolysis by evaluating perfusion/diffusion mismatch on MRI. The IV rt-PA was initiated within 3-6 h, and additional urokinase (UK) was then administered via the IA route after angiography. RESULTS: Four patients had middle cerebral artery occlusion and one patient had an internal carotid artery occlusion. The median time from the symptom onset to the initiation of IV therapy and to the initiation of IA treatment was 215 +/- 30 min and 292 +/- 41 min, respectively. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores were as follows: initial, 13; immediately after IA treatment, 8; at 24 h, 5; and at 7 days, 3. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score after the completion of thrombolysis was 2-3. Four patients without intracerebral hemorrhage recovered completely or exhibited mild disability and one patient with hemorrhage also demonstrated a favorable outcome. CONCLUSION: This preliminary result suggests that if a significant perfusion/diffusion mismatch on MRI is identified, a sequential combination thrombolysis of IV rt-PA and IA UK is potentially beneficial in moderate to severe acute ischemic stroke patients who are treated within 3-6 h after symptom onset.",M2
18212687,"Intramuscular or combined intramuscular/intra-arterial administration of bone marrow mononuclear cells: a clinical trial in patients with advanced limb ischemia.AIM: Recent evidence indicates that bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMC) promote collateral vessel formation in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, aspects concerning optimal administration mode, durability and long-term safety require consideration. Combined intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) plus intramuscular (IM) BMC delivery may be more effective than exclusive intramuscular injections. The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility, safety and effect of exclusive IM versus combined IM+IA delivery of autologous BMC in patients who were not candidates for surgical or endovascular treatment. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were treated with either combined IA+IM (N=12) or sole IM (N=15) administration of autologous BMC. Efficacy was assessed after 1, 6 and 12 months. Limb salvage, pain-free walking distance, ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) and pain scores were evaluated. RESULTS: There were no adverse reactions related to injection of the cells. Three patients died within the first year of follow-up due to non-procedure related causes. Two patients in the IA+IM group required limb amputation because of ongoing critical ischemia versus 7 patients in the IM group (P=0.17). BMC treatment in the remaining patients resulted in a significant and sustained (&gt;12 months) improvement. Pain-free walking distance improved from 81+/-56 meters at baseline to 257+/-126 meters at t=6 months (P=0.0002). Mean ABI increased 23% after 6 months (P=0.01) and pain score reduced for up to 50% as shown by Brief Pain Inventory (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Both IM and combined IM/IA delivery of autologous BMC are safe, and result in relevant and sustained improvement in a considerable proportion of patients with severe PAD who are not amenable for conventional treatment.",M2
18190496,"Postprocedure intravenous eptifibatide following intra-arterial reteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early use of intravenous platelet glycoprotein IIB/IIIA antagonists after intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) thrombolysis may reduce the risk of reocclusion and microvascular compromise. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to determine the in-hospital outcomes using serial neurological evaluations and imaging among patients treated with intravenous eptifibatide administered as a 135 microg/kg single-dose bolus, followed by 0.5 microg/kg/min infusions for 20 to 24 hours following treatment with IA reteplase. RESULTS: Twenty patients were treated (mean age +/- standard deviation, 68.4 +/- 14.5 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score was 17). The dose of reteplase ranged from 0.5 to 4 units. Eleven patients demonstrated early neurological improvement, defined as a decline of &gt; or =4 points on the 24 hours NIHSS score compared with initial NIHSS score; neurological deterioration, defined as an increase of &gt; or =4 points on the 24 hours NIHSS score as compared with initial NIHSS score, was observed in one patient. Two asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages were observed while no symptomatic hemorrhages were observed on serial computed tomographic scans. CONCLUSIONS: The use of intravenous eptifibatide within 24 hours in selected patients after IA thrombolysis is feasible and safe. Further studies are required to determine the benefit of early use of intravenous eptifibatide following thrombolysis.",M2
19326772,"Pharmacokinetics of cladribine in a rat model following subcutaneous and intra-arterial injections.Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 6-8 per group) weighing from 300-450 g were used for the study. Each rat received a single dose of cladribine (CdA) by <e>ia</e> (1 mg/kg) or s.c. (2 mg/kg) injection. Pharmacokinetic data were calculated by standard procedures assuming a 2-compartment open model following i.v. bolus using WinNonLin and Rstrips, and differences between the two modes of injections were considered significance when p &lt; 0.05. The results showed that plasma concentrations of CdA decreased rapidly following a biphasic decline after both ia and s.c. administrations. The AUC and t1/2 beta after a single 1 mg/kg ia and 2 mg/kg s.c. injection of CdA were 0.66 +/- 0.34 vs 1.2 +/- 0.3 microg x h/ml and 3.5 +/- 2.1 vs 4.5 +/- 2.2 h, respectively (p &gt; 0.05). The mean absolute bioavailability following the s.c. injection was close to 90%. The inter-subject variability of plasma concentrations of CdA was 35% and 150% following sc and ia injections, respectively. It is concluded that the rat is a reasonably good animal model to study the pharmacokinetics of CdA in plasma, and that sc injection may produce more favourable pharmacokinetic profiles than ia injection following a single dose.",M2
17986040,"Intentional use of intra-arterial medications when venous access is not available.The difficult or impossible establishment of venous access is occasionally encountered in the pediatric population, especially in patients exposed to repeated surgical procedures or those with underlying comorbid features. Potential options in such situations include the intramuscular, intraosseous (IO), and intratracheal administration of medications. Although IO access is accepted as the route of choice in emergency situations, its use is not universally accepted in the operating room setting when the administration of medications is nonemergent. We report the intentional and elective use of the intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) administration of vecuronium, atropine, fentanyl, and fluid during the provision of anesthesia for two infants with severe cyanotic congenital heart disease in whom venous access could not readily be obtained. The potential role of IA administration of medications is discussed and previous reports from the literature are reviewed.",M2
17968964,"MRI of ischemic stroke in canines: applications for monitoring intraarterial thrombolysis.PURPOSE: To describe a canine embolic stroke model that is appropriate for endovascular procedure evaluations and develop local cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps to monitor the progression of stroke and thrombolysis. In the future, MR may displace X-ray imaging in some endovascular procedures, such as intraarterial (<e>IA</e>) thrombolysis for stroke therapy, due to increased monitoring capabilities. For MR to attain its full potential in endovascular therapy, the development of appropriate disease models and monitoring techniques is essential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The canine stroke model uses an injection of autologous clot to produce ischemic and infarcted tissue and produces a range of stroke severities within the anterior cerebral circulation. Local CBF maps were formed by using the catheter that would be in place to deliver the thrombolytic agent for treatment to deliver the gadolinium-based contrast agent for perfusion imaging. RESULTS: After the injection of clot, changes on imaging were consistent with the progression of ischemic stroke. Local CBF maps showed perfusion changes with stroke progression and treatment. CONCLUSION: We successfully demonstrate the progression of ischemic stroke in the canine to mimic the progression of human stroke. CBF maps to show local perfusion characteristics show great potential in the evaluation of stroke therapy.",M2
17909806,"Effect of N-acetylcysteine route of administration on chemoprotection against cisplatin-induced toxicity in rat models.Dosing and route of administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for protection against cisplatin (CDDP) nephrotoxicity was investigated in rats. Two models of toxicity were tested: a single high dose of CDDP (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally (IP)), and multiple low dose treatments (1 mg/kg IP twice a day for 4 days, 10 days rest, then repeated). NAC (50-1,200 mg/kg) was given to the rats by IP, oral (PO), intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) routes. Renal toxicity was determined by blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CR) levels 3 days after treatment. Blood collected 15 min after NAC was analyzed for total NAC. Both models of CDDP administration produced renal toxicity. In the single dose CDDP model, NAC 400 mg/kg given IP and PO produced no renal protection as measured by BUN (131.8 +/- 8.2 and 123.3 +/- 8.2, respectively) or CR (2.3 +/- 0.38 and 1.77 +/- 0.21, respectively). IV NAC reduced nephrotoxicity, (BUN 26.3 +/- 6.8, CR 0.47 +/- 0.15). NAC 50 mg/kg IA gave better protection than IV. In the repeated-dose CDDP model, nephrotoxicity was blocked by 800 mg/kg NAC given IV but not IP. Blood concentrations of total NAC showed a dose response after IV NAC, but high dose NAC (1,200 mg/kg) by the PO route gave very low levels of NAC. Thus the protective properties of NAC are affected by the dose and route of administration.",M2
17898199,"Anterior cerebral artery emboli in combined intravenous and intra-arterial rtPA treatment of acute ischemic stroke in the IMS I and II trials.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) emboli may occur before or during fibrinolytic revascularization of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) T occlusions. We sought to determine the incidence and effect of baseline and new embolic ACA occlusions in the Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS) studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case report forms, pretreatment and posttreatment arteriograms, and CTs from 142 subjects entered into IMS I &amp; II were reviewed to identify subjects with baseline ACA occlusion, new ACA emboli occurring during fibrinolysis, subsequent CT-demonstrated infarction in the ACA distribution, and to evaluate global and lower extremity motor clinical outcome. RESULTS: During M1/M2 thrombolysis procedures, new ACA embolus occurred in 1 of 60 (1.7%) subjects. Baseline distal emboli were identified in 3 of 20 (15%) T occlusions before intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) treatment, and new posttreatment distal ACA emboli were identified in 3 subjects. At 24 hours, 8 (32%) T occlusions demonstrated CT-ACA infarct, typically of small volume. Infarcts were less common following sonography microcatheter-assisted thrombolysis compared with standard microcatheter thrombolysis (P = .05). Lower extremity weakness was present in 9 of 10 subjects with ACA embolus/infarct at 24 hours. The modified Rankin 0 to 2 outcomes were achieved in 4 of 25 (16%) subjects with T occlusion overall, but in 0 of 10 subjects with distal ACA emboli or ACA CT infarcts (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: With IV/IA recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment for MCA emboli, new ACA emboli are uncommon events. Distal ACA emboli during T-occlusion thrombolysis are not uncommon, typically lead to small ACA-distribution infarcts, and may limit neurologic recovery.",M2
17885240,"Assessment of vasculature of meningiomas and the effects of embolization with intra-arterial MR perfusion imaging: a feasibility study.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Embolization of meningiomas has emerged as a preoperative adjuvant therapy that has proved effective in mitigating blood loss during surgical resection. Arterial supply to these tumors is typically identified by diffuse areas of parenchymal staining after selective x-ray angiograms. We investigate the benefits that selective injection of MR contrast may have in identifying vascular territories and determining the effects of embolization therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Selective intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) injection of dilute MR contrast media was used to assess the vascular distribution territories of meningeal tumors before and after embolization therapy. Regions of the tumor that experienced loss of signal intensity after localized contrast injections into the external and common carotid as well as vertebral arteries were used to quantify the specific vessel's volume of distribution. Assessments were made before and after embolization to reveal changes in the vascular supply of the tumor. MR findings were compared with radiographic evaluation of tumor vascular supply on the basis of conventional x-ray angiography. RESULTS: MR proved to be an excellent means to assess tissue fed by selected arteries and clearly demonstrated the treated and untreated portions of the neoplasm after therapy. In some instances, MR revealed postembolization residual enhancement of the tumor that was difficult to appreciate on x-ray angiograms. Very low contrast dose was necessary, which made repeated assessment during therapy practical. CONCLUSION: MR perfusion imaging with selective IA injection of dilute contrast can reveal the distribution territory of vessels. Changes in tumor vasculature could be detected after embolization, which reveal the volumetric fraction of the tumor affected by the therapy.",M2
17668156,"Feasibility of <e>IA</e> thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke among anticoagulated patients.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Limited information exists regarding thrombolysis among anticoagulated acute stroke patients. We present data from three consecutive patients, on active warfarin therapy, treated with intra-arterial reteplase. CASES: All patients were screened for the presence of intracranial hemorrhage. Warfarin was reversed with fresh frozen plasma in all patients and cerebral angiography and intra-arterial administration of reteplase was performed. Computed tomographic scans were performed to detect any subsequent intracranial hemorrhage. Ages ranged from 58 to 79 years with initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores ranging from 12 to 17. Baseline international normalized ratios (INRs) were 1.99-2.25. None of the patients suffered from intracranial hemorrhage following thrombolysis, and two of the patients experienced early neurological improvement. CONCLUSION: Low dose, intra-arterial reteplase following acute reversal of elevated INR is feasible and may offer a potential treatment for patients suffering with acute ischemic stroke while receiving active warfarin treatment.",M2
17562835,"Intra-arterial therapies for acute ischemic stroke.BACKGROUND: There are no randomized trials comparing intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) therapy with best medical treatment for acute ischemic stroke. To assess potential benefit from this therapeutic approach, we performed a systematic review of published IA series. Because outcome from stroke is highly dependent on baseline characteristics, we compared results against prognostic models adjusted for admission National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and age. METHODS: We selected articles from MEDLINE and Cochrane Databases based on specified criteria that included 3-month clinical follow-up. Outcome functions from prognostic models were generated and difference from prediction calculated for each study. Best and worst mortality performers were identified and assessed for factors that distinguished them. RESULTS: We identified 27 reports with 30 treatment series representing 1,117 patients. Percent difference from predicted outcomes varied from -51 to +24.6% for mortality and -30.3 to +28.7% for good functional outcome. A mean overall difference in the percent that died compared with prediction was 0.25% (SD: +/-3.5%; 95% CI: +/-0.53) and in the percentage of those that achieved a good functional outcome compared with prediction was -0.15% (SD: +/-2.7%; 95% CI: +/-0.44). The quartile of better mortality performers relative to worst performers had a 4.8-point more severe NIHSS score at baseline (p = 0.028) and employed 50% lower doses of the most frequently used thrombolytic urokinase (p = 0.0034). CONCLUSION: We found considerable variability and lack of evidence for a net improvement in outcome after intra-arterial therapy relative to predicted natural history, substantiating the need for a prospective comparison with best medical therapy. The features associated with better performers identified here may be useful in designing such a trial.",M2
17540973,"Debunking 7 myths that hamper the realization of randomized controlled trials on intra-arterial thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although intravenous (IV) thrombolysis is the standard treatment for patients with ischemic stroke occurring within 3 hours from symptom onset, a few interventional neuroradiologists have been treating this category of patients by an intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) route for &gt;25 years. However, evidence is still required to support the clinical feeling that IA treatment, which needs longer time and greater complexity, leads to a better outcome. Therefore, the objective of the present review was to analyze beliefs and myths underlying the selection of patients for IA thrombolysis. METHODS: We identified and debunked the following myths on IA thrombolysis: (1) IA thrombolysis works better than IV because it achieves higher recanalization rates; (2) IA thrombolysis works better than IV after the 3-hour window; (3) IA thrombolysis works better than IV in vertebrobasilar stroke; (4) carotid duplex, transcranial doppler, CT angiography, or MRA should be used to screen for major vessel occlusion treatable with IA thrombolysis; (5) to be treated with IA thrombolysis, patients should be selected with diffusion/perfusion MRI; (6) IA thrombolysis should be used as a  rescue  therapy for IV thrombolysis; and (7) the efficacy of IA thrombolysis depends on the thrombolytic agent or the device used. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on acute stroke management with IA thrombolysis is scant. Therefore, neither clinicians nor patients have enough information to make truly informed decisions about the most appropriate treatment. Only randomized controlled trials can clear uncertainties about the possible superiority of IA over IV thrombolysis. Regretfully, case series on IA treatment have limited the organization of such trials and have only favored the spread of myths.",M2
17445610,"Intra-arterial verapamil-induced seizures: case report and review of the literature.BACKGROUND: Intra-arterial verapamil infusion with or without balloon angioplasty is a common therapy for patients with hypertensive, hypervolemic, and nimodipine-refractory vasospasm following aSAH. Seizures occurring from <e>IA</e> infusion of verapamil are rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 24-year-old Korean-American woman presented with aSAH from the rupture of a 5-mm ICA bifurcation aneurysm. The aneurysm was secured with clip ligation through a craniotomy, and the patient was treated with HHH therapy in the neurosurgical ICU. Routine postoperative cerebral angiography was performed to confirm occlusion of the treated aneurysm and assess for vasospasm. In the first angiogram, vasospasm was detected in the supraclinoid portion of the ICA. Intra-arterial verapamil was started; during this treatment, the patient developed right-sided focal motor seizures. The infusion was terminated and the seizures were halted with midazolam. The patient's course was unremarkable until postoperative day 7, when she developed expressive aphasia, for which she was taken for emergent cerebral angiography under anesthesia. Marked focal spasm was identified in the distal supraclinoid ICA and the left A1. The patient was treated with 25 mg of superselective verapamil infusion. Upon emerging from anesthesia, her aphasia had resolved; however, 90 minutes after angiography, she experienced generalized seizures while she was in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Seizures are a rare complication during cerebral angiographic procedures. Intra-arterial verapamil-induced seizures are infrequently reported. Cognizance for the potential of seizures to occur is advised during verapamil infusion for the treatment of refractory vasospasm in certain individuals.",M2
17420625,"Review of the current status of intra-arterial thrombolysis for treating acute cerebral infarction: a retrospective analysis of the data from multiple centers in Korea.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to review the current status of intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) thrombolysis in Korea by conducting a retrospective analysis of the data from multiple domestic centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The radiologists at each participating institution were asked to fill out case report forms on all patients who had undergone IA recanalization due to acute anterior circulation ischemia. These forms included clinical, imaging and procedure-related information. A central reader analyzed the CT/MR and angiographic results. The rates of successful recanalization, hemorrhagic transformation and functional outcome were obtained. The univariate analyses were performed together with the multivariate analysis. RESULTS: We analyzed the data from 163 patients, and they had been treated at seven institutes. The initial imaging modalities were CT for 46 patients (28%), MR for 63 (39%), and both for 54 (33%). Various mechanical treatment methods were applied together in 50% of the patients. Radiologically significant hemorrhage was noted in 20/155 patients (13%). We found various factors that influenced the recanalization rate and the occurrence of significant hemorrhagic transformations. The favorable outcome rate, reported as modified Rankin Scale &lt; or = 2, was 40%, and the mortality rate was 11%. The factors that predicted a poor functional outcome were old age (p = 0.01), initially severe neurological symptoms (p &lt; 0.0001), MR findings of a wide distribution of lesions (p = 0.001), involvement of the basal ganglia (p = 0.01), performance of procedures after working hours (p = 0.01), failure of recanalization (p = 0.003), contrast extravasation after the procedure (p = 0.007) and significant hemorrhagic transformation (p = 0.002). The subsequent multivariate analysis failed to show any statistically significant variable. CONCLUSION: There was a trend toward increased dependency on MR imaging during the initial evaluation and increased usage of combined pharmacologic/mechanical thrombolysis. The imaging and clinical outcome results of this study were comparable to those of the previous major thrombolytic trials.",M2
17413997,"Intra-arterial drug delivery: a concise review.The therapeutic potential of intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) drug delivery to the brain has received limited attention in the last decade. In the 1980s, efforts to treat brain tumors with IA chemotherapy, the leading application of this technology, yielded modest results. Poor control of tissue drug concentrations and the potential risk of permanent neurologic injury further prevented the wider use of IA drugs. Yet, IA drugs were anecdotally used for treating a wide spectrum of brain diseases. Recent advances in endovascular technology and the increased safety of angiographic procedures now compel us to reevaluate IA drug delivery. This review describes the pharmacologic principles, applications, and pitfalls of IA drug delivery to the brain.",M2
17376548,"Effects of non-ionic iodinated contrast media on patient heart rate and pressures during intra-cardiac or intra-arterial injection.PURPOSE: To compare the effects on heart rate (HR), on left ventricular (LV) or arterial pressures, and the general safety of a non-ionic low-osmolar contrast medium (CM) and a non-ionic iso-osmolar CM in patients undergoing cardiac angiography (CA) or peripheral intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (<e>IA</e>-DSA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two double-blind, randomized studies were conducted in 216 patients who underwent CA (n=120) or peripheral IA-DSA (n=96). Patients referred for CA received a low-osmolar monomeric CM (iomeprol-350, n=60) or an iso-osmolar dimeric CM (iodixanol-320; n=60). HR and LV peak systolic and end-diastolic pressures were determined before and after the first injection during left and right coronary arteriography and left ventriculography. Monitoring for all types of adverse event (AE) was performed for 24 h following the procedure. t-tests were performed to compare CM for effects on HR. Patients referred for IA-DSA received iomeprol-300 (n=49) or iodixanol-320 (n=47). HR and arterial blood pressure (BP) were evaluated before and after the first 4 injections. Monitoring for AE was performed for 4 h following the procedure. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare mean HR changes across the first 4 injections, whereas changes after the first injection were compared using t-tests. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted between iomeprol and iodixanol in terms of mean changes in HR during left coronary arteriography (p=0.8), right coronary arteriography (p=0.9), and left ventriculography (p=0.8). In patients undergoing IA-DSA, no differences between CM were noted for effects on mean HR after the first injection (p=0.6) or across the first 4 injections (p=0.2). No significant differences (p&gt;0.05) were noted in terms of effects on arterial BP in either study or on LV pressures in patients undergoing CA. Non-serious AE considered possibly CM-related (primarily headache and events affecting the cardiovascular and digestive systems) were reported more frequently by patients undergoing CA and more frequently after iodixanol (14/60 [23.3%] and 2/47 [4.3%]; CA and IA-DSA, respectively) than iomeprol (10/60 [16.7%] and 1/49 [2%], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Iomeprol and iodixanol are safe and have equally negligible effects on HR and LV pressures or arterial BP during and after selective intra-cardiac injection and peripheral IA-DSA. CLINICAL APPLICATION: Iomeprol and iodixanol are safe and equally well tolerated with regard to cardiac rhythm and clinical preference should be based on diagnostic image quality alone.",M2
16960093,"Reduced pretreatment ipsilateral middle cerebral artery cerebral blood flow is predictive of symptomatic hemorrhage post-intra-arterial thrombolysis in patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can be a devastating complication associated with thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that patients with lower prethrombolysis cerebral blood flow (CBF) were at a higher risk of symptomatic ICH (sICH). METHODS: Twenty-three patients who underwent quantitative CBF assessment with Xenon CT studies for acute stroke before intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) thrombolysis for a middle cerebral artery (MCA) or internal carotid artery terminus occlusion within 6 hours of symptom onset were studied. Univariate and multivariate analysis were carried out to determine predictors of sICH post-IA thrombolysis. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to determine the association between mean ipsilateral CBF and the occurrence of sICH. RESULTS: The mean age of our cohort was 68+/-12 years and a mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 18+/-3. In univariate analysis, patients with higher percent of core infarct, hyperglycemia, and reduced mean ipsilateral CBF were at risk of sICH. In multivariate analysis only mean ipsilateral CBF was associated with higher rates of sICH (odds ratio 1.58; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.51; P&lt;0.04). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.97; P&lt;0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lower pre-IA thrombolysis mean ipsilateral MCA CBF are at significantly higher risk for sICH in the setting of a MCA or carotid terminus occlusion. The threshold identified in this study may be useful for selection of patients with acute MCA occlusions for acute stroke thrombolysis.",M2

16528185,"Stent-assisted intracranial recanalization for acute stroke: early results.OBJECTIVE: In patients who are not candidates for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) therapy is an alternative. Current recanalization rates are 50 to 60% for IA thrombolysis. Stent-assisted recanalization in the setting of acute stroke after failed thrombolysis may improve recanalization rates. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 19 patients treated at two institutions between July 2001 and March, 2005 with intracranial stenting of a vessel resistant to standard thrombolytic techniques. Demographics, clinical, and radiographic presentation and outcomes were studied. RESULTS: Thirteen men and six women with a median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 16 (range, 15-22) were included. Eight lesions were located at the internal carotid artery terminus, seven in the M1/M2 segment, and four in the basilar artery. Average time-to-treatment was 210 +/- 160 minutes. Overall recanalization rate (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Grade 2 or 3) was 79%. There were six deaths: five due to progression of stroke and withdrawal of care at the family's request and one as the result of a delayed carotid injury after tracheostomy. One postoperative asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred without adverse affect on outcome. Median discharge NIHSS score of surviving patients was 5 (range, 2.5-11.5). Lesions at the internal carotid artery terminus (P &lt; 0.009), older age (P &lt; 0.003), and higher baseline NIHSS score (P &lt; 0.009) were significant negative outcome predictors, as measured by &gt;3 modified Rankin scale score at discharge. CONCLUSION: Stent-assisted recanalization for acute stroke resulting from intracranial thrombotic occlusion is associated with a high recanalization rate and low intracranial hemorrhage rate. These initial results suggest that stenting may be an option for recalcitrant cerebral arterial occlusions.",M2
16527997,"Multimodal reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke: factors predicting vessel recanalization.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular therapies using mechanical and pharmacological modalities for large vessel occlusions in acute stroke are rapidly evolving. Our aim was to determine whether one modality is associated with higher recanalization rates. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 168 consecutive patients treated with intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) therapy for acute ischemic stroke between May 1999 and November 15, 2005. Demographic, clinical, radiographic, angiographic, and procedural notes were reviewed. Recanalization was defined as achieving thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 2 or 3 flow after intervention. A logistic regression model was constructed to determine independent predictors of successful recanalization. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were reviewed with a mean age of 64+/-13 years and mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 17+/-4. Recanalization was achieved in 106 (63%) patients. Independent predictors of recanalization include: the combination of IA thrombolytics and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (odds ratio [OR], 2.9 [95% CI, 1.04 to 6.7]; P&lt;0.048), intracranial stent placement with angioplasty (OR, 4.8 [95% CI, 1.8 to 10.0]; P&lt;0.001), or extracranial stent placement with angioplasty (OR, 4.2 [95% CI, 1.4 to 9.8]; P&lt;0.014). Lesions at the terminus of the internal carotid artery were recalcitrant to revascularization (OR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.73]; P value 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial or extracranial stenting or combination therapy with IA thrombolytics and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the setting of multimodal therapy is associated with successful recanalization in patients treated with multimodal endovascular reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke.",M2
16418350,"First-pass quantitative CT perfusion identifies thresholds for salvageable penumbra in acute stroke patients treated with intra-arterial therapy.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether, in acute stroke patients treated with intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) recanalization therapy, CT perfusion (CTP) can distinguish ischemic brain tissue destined to infarct from that which will survive. METHODS: Dynamic CTP was obtained in 14 patients within 8 hours of stroke onset, before IA therapy. Initial quantitative cerebral blood volume (CBV) and flow (CBF) values were visually segmented and normalized in the  infarct core  (region 1: reduced CBV and CBF, infarction on follow-up),  penumbra that infarcts  (region 2: normal CBV, reduced CBF, infarction on follow-up), and  penumbra that recovers  (region 3: normal CBV, reduced CBF, normal on follow-up). Normalization was accomplished by dividing the ischemic region of interest value by that of a corresponding, contralateral, uninvolved region, which resulted in CBV and CBF  ratios.  Separate CBV and CBF values were obtained in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). RESULTS: Mean CBF ratios for regions 1, 2, and 3 were 0.19 +/- 0.06, 0.34 +/- 0.06, and 0.46 +/- 0.09, respectively (all P &lt; .001). Mean CBV ratios for regions 1, 2, and 3 were similarly distinct (all P &lt; .05). Absolute CBV and CBF values for regions 2 and 3 were not significantly different. All regions with CBF ratio &lt;0.32, CBV ratio &lt;0.68, CBF &lt;12.7 mL/100 g/min, or CBV &lt;2.2 mL/100 g infarcted. No region with CBF ratio &gt;0.44 infarcted. GM versus WM CBF and CBV values were significantly different for region 2 compared with region 3 (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: In acute stroke patients, quantitative CTP can distinguish ischemic tissue likely to infarct from that likely to survive.",M2
16386738,"Cardiovascular actions of the stress-related neurohormonal peptides, corticotropin-releasing factor and urotensin-I in the trout Oncorhynchus mykiss.In this review, we summarize the most significant data concerning the cardiovascular effects of centrally and peripherally administered synthetic trout corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and urotensin-I (U-I) in our animal model, the unanesthetized trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Although there is more than 60% sequence identity between these two stress-related neurohormonal peptides, CRF and U-I-induced differential actions upon the mean dorsal aortic blood pressure (Pda) and the heart rate (HR) in trout maintained under similar experimental situations. After intracerebroventricular injections, only U-I induced an increase in Pda while in non-cannulated trout, CRF only decreased the HR and elevated the heart rate variability by a presumed activation of the parasympathetic nervous system activity to the heart. The CRF antagonist, the alpha-helical CRF(9-41) blocked these central actions of CRF. After intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) injections, U-I induced a direct hypotensive action and an elevation in HR. This hypotensive phase was reversed to hypertension by the release of catecholamines. IA injection of CRF caused no change in Pda or HR. These cardiovascular effects are compared with the much better established actions of CRF and the orthologous urocortins in mammals.",M2
16212588,"Comparison of perioperative analgesic protocols for dogs undergoing tibial plateau leveling osteotomy.OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of 3 commonly used perioperative analgesic protocols (epidural injection, intra-articular injection, and intravenous [IV] injection) for management of postoperative pain in dogs after tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized clinical trial. ANIMALS: Fifty-six healthy dogs with naturally occurring cranial cruciate ligament rupture. METHODS: Dogs were premedicated with IV hydromorphone and acepromazine and were randomly assigned to receive either E (preoperative epidural injection with morphine and bupivacaine), <e>IA</e> (pre- and postoperative intra-articular injections of bupivacaine), or C (neither epidural morphine and bupivacaine, nor intra-articular bupivacaine). All dogs were administered hydromorphone (0.05 mg/kg IV) at extubation and as needed to maintain comfort postoperatively. Patients were observed and monitored continuously for 24 hours and discomfort was assessed using visual analog pain scores (VASs), multifactorial pain scores (MPSs), and response to a pressure nociceptive threshold (PNT) measuring device. Time to 1st dose and the total doses of hydromorphone required to achieve adequate comfort for each dog were recorded. RESULTS: No differences in measured indices of postoperative pain were observed between dogs of each treatment group; VAS (P=.190), MPS (P=.371), and PNT (P=.160). Time to 1st analgesic intervention was longer for Group E compared with Group C (P=.005) and longer for Group IA compared with Group C (P=.032). Although time to 1st intervention between Groups E and IA were longer for Group E, differences were not significant. To provide an adequate level of comfort, more analgesic interventions were administered to dogs in Group C compared with dogs in group E (P=.015). On average, more hydromorphone was administered to Group C compared with Group IA (P=.072) and to Group IA compared with Group E (P=.168), but statistical significance was not reached for these data. CONCLUSIONS: In this study population, significant differences were seen in time to 1st hydromorphone dose between Groups E and IA compared with Group C. As well, more supplemental analgesia was administered to Group C compared with Group E to maintain the same level of postoperative comfort. Although differences between Groups E and IA tended to favor the epidural group, differences were minimal and not statistically significant. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that regardless of analgesic protocol, measured indices of pain in dogs after TPLO can be minimized if dogs are continuously observed and appropriately supplemented with parenteral opioids. However, the frequency of postoperative opioid dosing can be minimized and may be a factor when contemplating supplementary use of epidural or intra-articular injections as part of a balanced analgesic approach.",M2
16120927,"Intraarterial versus IV gadolinium injections for MR angiography: quantitative and qualitative assessment of the infrainguinal arteries.OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to quantitatively and qualitatively compare 3D intraarterial (<e>IA</e>) gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography (IA MRA) versus the standard of reference of MR angiography, 3D IV gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography (IV MRA), in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) for use during catheter-based MR-guided endovascular interventions. CONCLUSION: IA MRA provides image quality of the infrainguinal arteries in PAOD patients comparable to IV MRA with a significantly improved assessment of the infrapopliteal arteries due to reduced venous contamination. Further benefits of IA MRA include usage of only very low doses of gadolinium and simplified bolus timing.",M2
15956497,"Selective intraarterial nimodipine treatment in an experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage model.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral vasospasm secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been a serious clinical problem. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of selective intraarterial (<e>IA</e>) nimodipine treatment in a rabbit model of chronic cerebral vasospasm. METHODS: Twenty-two adult New-Zealand rabbits of either sex, weighing 2500-3800 g were used for this study. Following a control angiography, all animals received 1 mL of fresh unheparinized autologuous arterial blood into the cisterna magna. Three days later, the presence of vasospasm was demonstrated angiographically by selective vertebral artery injection. The experimental design was as follows: separate groups of animals (n = 5, in each group) received nimodipine (0.05 mg/kg), papaverine (6 mg/kg), or vehicle intraarterially, after placement of a microcatheter into the vertebral artery. Another group (n = 5) received nimodipine (0.05 mg/kg) directly into the cisterna magna, and vehicle injection was made into cisterna magna in two other animals. Thirty minutes after treatment, angiographies were repeated and changes in arterial diameter were expressed as percentages of control. RESULTS: IA nimodipine and IA papaverine were effective in relieving veretebral and basilary vasospasm (P &lt; .05). IA nimodipine was more effective than IA papaverine (P &lt; .05). IA nimodipine was not more effective than intrathecal (IT) nimodipine in relieving vertebral artery vasospasm, although it was more effective than IT nimodipine in basilar artery. Vehicle injections (IA or IT) failed to reverse the vasospasm induced by autologuous blood injection. CONCLUSION: This study showed that selective IA nimodipine treatment may be considered as an alternative in the treatment of chronic vasospasm following SAH.",M2

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility included T4 squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. Patients received cisplatin (150 mg/m(2) IA with sodium thiosulfate 9 g/m(2) intravenous [IV], followed by 12 g/m(2) IV over 6 hours, weekly for 4 weeks) and concurrent RT (70 Gy, 2.0 Gy/fraction, daily for 5 days over 7 weeks). Between May 1997 and December 1999, 67 patients from three experienced and eight inexperienced centers were enrolled, of whom 61 were eligible for analysis. RESULTS: Multi-RADPLAT was feasible (ie, three or four infusions of IA cisplatin and full dose of RT) in 53 patients (87%). The complete response (CR) rate was 85% at the primary site and 88% at nodal regions, and the overall CR rate was 80%. At a median follow-up of 3.9 years for alive patients (range, 0.9 to 6.1 years), the estimated 1-year and 2-year locoregional tumor control rates are 66% and 57%, respectively. The estimated 1-year and 2-year survival rates are 72% and 63%, respectively. The estimated 1-year and 2-year disease-free survival rates are 62% and 46%, respectively. The rates of grade 4 and 5 toxicities at the experienced and the inexperienced institutions were 14% and 0% v 47% and 4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This intensive treatment regimen for head and neck cancer is feasible and effective in a multi-institutional setting.",M2
15714958,"[Intra-arterial administration of fasudil hydrochloride: duration of action]Intra-arterial infusion (<e>IA</e>) of fasudil hydrochloride for cerebral vasospasm is performed in many institutions and is associated with few side effects. Nonetheless, as optimum dose and duration of action remain unknown, the present study aimed to clarify these variables. We performed intra-arterial injection of fasudil hydrochloride for eight patients with cerebral vasospasm 7-13 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fasudil hydrochloride was administered via the internal carotid artery without selective microcatheterization, at a concentration and speed of 30 mg/20 ml/10-15 min, using a total dose of 30-60 mg. Cerebral angiography was used to measure change in blood vessel diameter at 19 points, and perfusion CT was used to detect changes in cerebral blood perfusion (CBP), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) at 12 hemispheres. Investigations were performed before IA, immediately after IA (post IA), and 4.5 to 6 hours later. For central vessels, (A1, M1) mean change in diameter (cm) measured pre IA, post IA, and 4.5-6 hours later was 1.2 +/- 0.68, 1.5 +/- 0.72, and 1.2 +/- 0.7, respectively. For peripheral vessels (peripheral to A1, M1, and the ophthalmic artery) change in diameter (cm) was 0.65 +/- 0.16, 0.97 +/- 0.24, and 0.71 +/- 0.24, respectively. Average CBP (m/100g/min) in the infused hemisphere at pre IA, post IA, and 4.5-6 hours later was 41.6 +/- 3.56, 46.4 +/- 5.82, 41.6 +/- 7.42, respectively. Average CBV (ml/100g) was 2.72 +/- 0.21, 2.73 +/- 0.21, 2.91 +/- 0.42, respectively and average MTT (sec) was 5.16 +/- 0.38, 4.57 +/- 0.70, 5.55 +/- 1.0, respectively. Changes in peripheral vessel diameter and in MTT were statistically significant. Therefore, when performing intra-arterial administration of fasudil hydrochloride, clinicians should be aware that vasodilator effect is less than 6 hours.",M2
15713927,"Catheter-directed MR angiography and cross-sectional imaging for the assessment of renal artery stenosis.PURPOSE: Catheter-directed intraarterial (<e>IA</e>) gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced gradient-echo (GRE) imaging has been used in the setting of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided endovascular procedures for two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) depiction of blood vessels. In a swine model, the hypothesis was tested that the combination of 2D IA GRE and 2D cross-sectional steady-state free precession (SSFP) imaging improves assessment of renal artery stenosis (RAS) compared with 3D IA GRE imaging alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bilateral RAS was surgically induced in seven pigs. Detection of stenoses was then compared between the combination of 2D projection IA GRE and cross-sectional 2D SSFP imaging without contrast agent and 3D IA GRE alone. Radiographic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was employed as the reference standard. Linear regression was used to compare stenosis measurements, with an alpha of 0.05. RESULTS: Radiographic DSA and MR imaging were successful in the seven animals (14 stenoses). With use of linear regression analysis, the combination of 2D IA GRE and 2D SSFP imaging had a higher r(2) (0.87 vs 0.72) and a slope closer to unity (1.02 vs 0.77) compared with 3D IA GRE imaging alone. When comparing intercepts, the regression line for SSFP significantly differed from that of 3D IA GRE imaging (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSION: The combination of 2D IA GRE and cross-sectional 2D SSFP imaging improves the accuracy of RAS detection compared with IA 3D IA-GRE alone.",M2
15703466,"A case-control analysis of intra-arterial urokinase thrombolysis in acute cardioembolic stroke.BACKGROUND: Intra-arterial urokinase (<e>IA</e>-UK) thrombolysis is frequently given in Japan to selected patients with acute cerebral artery occlusion. However, it is not clear whether or not IA-UK thrombolysis has an efficacy for acute stroke patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of IA-UK thrombolysis in acute cardioembolic stroke patients, by performing a case-control analysis using data from Japan's Multicenter Stroke Investigator's Collaboration (J-MUSIC). METHODS: 16,922 acute ischemic stroke patients were enrolled into J-MUSIC. From these patients, we selected 91 patients (UK group) who met the following criteria: treatment with IA-UK; 20-75 years of age; cardioembolic stroke; presenting with a carotid stroke; admission within 4.5 h of symptom onset, and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 5-22 points on admission. A control group of 182 patients without IA-UK treatment and matched to the NIHSS score, gender, and age was chosen. We compared the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at discharge and the mortality between the 2 groups. RESULTS: In both groups, the mean age was 65 +/- 8 years, and the median NIHSS score was 14. The mean interval between symptom onset and UK administration was 3.4 +/- 1.3 h, and the IA-UK dose was 392,000 +/- 200,000 units. The mRS score at discharge was lower in the UK group than in the control group (mean, SD, median; 2.8, 2.9, 2 in UK group vs. 3.3, 1.8, 4, in the control, respectively p = 0.031). A favorable outcome (mRS of 0-2) was more frequently observed in the UK group (50.5%) than in the control group (34.1%, p = 0.0124). No difference in the mortality rate was seen between the UK group (11.0%) and the control group (13.3%). As well, there was no difference in the length of hospital stay between the UK group (46 +/- 41 days, mean +/- SD) and the control group (42 +/- 42 days, mean +/- SD).

15520306,"Gelatin hydrogel microspheres enable pinpoint delivery of basic fibroblast growth factor for the development of functional collateral vessels.BACKGROUND: Various growth factors promote collateral vessel development and are regarded as promising for the treatment of vascular occlusive diseases. However, an efficacious delivery system for them has yet to be established. We devised a strategy to augment functional collateral vessels by using acidic gelatin hydrogel microspheres (AGHMs) incorporating basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The aim of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that by intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) administration of bFGF-impregnated AGHMs, bFGF could be delivered from AGHMs trapped in distal small-diameter vessels and thereby induce functional collateral vessels with an assured blood supply through the process of arteriogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Various sizes of AGHMs (3 mg) incorporating 125I-labeled bFGF were injected into the left internal iliac artery of a rabbit model of hindlimb ischemia. Less than 50% of radioactivity accumulated in the ischemic hindlimb after injection of AGHMs that were 10 mum in diameter, whereas approximately 80% of radioactivity was counted in the ischemic limb after administration of 29- or 59-microm-diameter AGHMs. Calf blood pressure ratio and the ratio of regional blood flow of the bilateral hindlimbs immediately before and after IA administration of 29-microm-diameter AGHMs showed no significant change. Then we evaluated the function of the developed collateral vessels 28 days after IA administration of bFGF-impregnated, 29-microm-diameter AGHMs. IA administration of bFGF-impregnated AGHMs induced marked collateral vessel improvement compared with IA administration of phosphate buffered saline-treated AGHMs and intramuscular administration of bFGF-impregnated AGHMs. CONCLUSIONS: IA administration of bFGF-impregnated, 29-microm-diameter AGHMs strongly induced functional collateral vessels without worsening ischemia, indicating the possible therapeutic usefulness of this approach.",M2
15502123,"Sequential combination of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and intra-arterial urokinase in acute ischemic stroke.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Combined intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) thrombolytic therapy may be faster and easier to initiate than monotherapy, and its recanalization rate may be better as well. The sequential combination of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) and urokinase (UK) has synergistic and complementary effects on clot lysis. We prospectively evaluated the effectiveness and safety of sequential combination of IV rTPA and IA UK in acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: IV rTPA was administered to patients with acute stroke within 3 hours of onset. Those whose condition had not improved at the end of rTPA infusion were further treated with selective IA UK. We evaluated baseline and 30-day National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores. RESULTS: Thirty patients were initially treated with IV rTPA; 24 were further treated with IA UK. Four patients who had rapid reocclusion following initial successful IA therapy received IV abciximab. Fourteen of 24 patients who underwent angiography had an effective perfusion state of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction grade 3 flow. Median baseline and 30-day NIHSS scores were 18 and 2, respectively. Eighteen patients improved to a modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1 after 90 days. Symptomatic hemorrhage developed in two patients. CONCLUSION: The strategy of using conventional-dose IV rTPA and the sequential combination of IA UK in patients without an early clinical response to IV treatment was safe and feasible. This strategy achieved high complete arterial recanalization rates and good functional outcomes.",M2
15450772,"MRI evaluation of treatment of embolic stroke in rat with intra-arterial and intravenous rt-PA.Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we investigated treatment of a rat model of embolic stroke with rt-PA via intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) and intravenous (IV) routes of administration. Rats were treated with rt-PA by either IA (n = 13) or IV (n = 13) routes at 3 h after stroke induction. Diffusion, perfusion, T2, and magnetization transfer MRI were performed prior to and at 1-3 and at 24 h after embolization. The IA treated group exhibited smaller lesion volumes than the IV treated group (p = 0.02). The relative areas with low ADCW and cerebral blood flow (CBF) after IA rt-PA intervention were significantly (p &lt; or = 0.03) smaller than those in the IV treated group at 24 h after embolization. Significant differences (p &lt; 0.02) between IA and IV treated groups in the relative area with high T2 and inverse of the apparent forward transfer rate of magnetization (kINV) in the ipsilateral hemisphere were also detected at 24 h after embolization. The IA treated group exhibited less intracerebral hemorrhage (27%) than the IV treated (64%) groups. Our data suggest that the beneficial effects of IA rt-PA treatment can be detected by changes in CBF, ADCW, T2, and kINV.",M2
14739411,"Magnetic resonance imaging improves detection of intracerebral hemorrhage over computed tomography after intra-arterial thrombolysis.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Unenhanced CT is routinely performed after intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) thrombolysis. The presence of residual contrast causing staining of injured brain may mimic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We evaluated MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for detection of ICH after IA thrombolysis, specifically in equivocal areas of hyperdensity seen on postprocedure CT, to help guide the decision to use anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy after the IA thrombolysis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 15 consecutive patients who underwent IA thrombolysis for acute stroke between September 2000 and March 2003. Inclusion criteria required an immediate postprocedure CT with a questionable hyperdensity and, within the next 48 hours, an MRI with DWI and/or SWI. RESULTS: All patients had CT regions of hyperdensity that were equivocal for the presence of ICH. All patients subsequently underwent DWI, and 11 also underwent SWI. Eleven of 15 patients had magnetic susceptibility-induced hypointensity in DWI hyperintensity regions, signifying the presence of acute deoxyhemoglobin. Nine of these patients also received SWI, which confirmed the presence of blood within these regions. Follow-up CT on all 11 patients confirmed ICH. In the 4 patients without DWI susceptibility change, 0 were found to have ICH on either SWI (performed in 2 patients) or follow-up CT. MRI reliably detected the presence of ICH in all patients, whereas CT failed to differentiate contrast staining from hemorrhage in 4 of the 15 patients. CONCLUSIONS: MRI is an effective means to detect the presence of blood within an equivocal region on post-IA thrombolysis CT. This may influence the decision to use anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy.",M2
14707420,"Hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign: can it be used to select intra-arterial versus intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke?BACKGROUND: Stroke patients with a hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCAS) may respond less favorably to intravenous (IV) thrombolysis. OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of patients with and without early CT findings treated with IV versus intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). METHODS: Initial and 24-hour CT scans of the head were evaluated in 83 consecutive stroke patients (66 on IV rtPA, 17 on IA rtPA). Time permitting, a CT angiogram was performed immediately after the initial CT scan to ascertain major cerebral artery occlusion. Demographics and etiological stroke subtype, times to thrombolysis and CT scan, baseline (prethrombolysis) and 24-hour National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score, discharge NIHSS score and 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS) were recorded. The initial CT of these patients was examined for early signs of stroke. The 24-hour scan was reviewed for the presence of infarct, hemorrhage and persistence of HCMAS. RESULTS: A favorable outcome, indicated by a significant improvement in the discharge NIHSS score, was noted with IA rtPA, irrespective of the presence (p = 0.001) or absence (p = 0.01) of HCMAS. A less favorable outcome in discharge NIHSS score was noted with IV rtPA in patients with HCMAS (p = not significant) than those without the sign (p &lt; 0.001). A similar proportion of patients with HCMAS exhibited a neurological improvement at 24 h as those without the sign in the IA rtPA group (p = 0.9). However, a smaller proportion of patients with HCMAS exhibited a neurological improvement at 24 h than those without the sign in the IV rtPA group (p = 0.005). The results were similar using 90-day mRS &lt;/=1 as an indicator of significant persistent improvement (p = 1.0 for IA rtPA and 0.04 for IV rtPA group). CONCLUSIONS: In a small sample, patients with HMCAS appeared to respond better to IA than IV rtPA.",M2
14648582,"Catheter-directed contrast-enhanced coronary MR angiography in swine using magnetization-prepared True-FISP.Contrast-enhanced (CE) coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) following intraarterial (<e>IA</e>) injection of contrast agent was compared using two sequences in swine: magnetization-prepared fast imaging with steady-state precession (True-FISP), and magnetization-prepared fast low-angle shot (FLASH). Thick-slice projection images were acquired with submillimeter in-plane spatial resolution (0.9 x 0.8 mm(2)). The magnetization-preparation scheme provided a clear delineation of the major coronary arteries with excellent background suppression. The True-FISP acquisition resulted in an increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) by approximately a factor of 2 over FLASH (P &lt; 0.05).

12939226,"Collagenase plaque digestion for facilitating guide wire crossing in chronic total occlusions.BACKGROUND: Chronic total occlusions (CTOs) are associated with significant angina, impaired left ventricular function, and worse long-term outcomes. Percutaneous coronary interventions in CTO are unsuccessful in up to 50% of cases, primarily because of inability to cross the lesion with a guide wire. Collagen is the predominant component of the atherosclerotic plaque. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and toxicity of local delivery of a collagen-degrading enzyme to facilitate guide wire crossing in CTO. METHODS AND RESULTS: Type <e>IA</e> collagenase (100 or 450 microg) or placebo was locally administered to 45 CTOs in a rabbit femoral artery model. Mean occlusion duration was 16+/-5 weeks. Attempts to cross the CTO (mean length, 28+/-9 mm) with conventional guide wires were assessed at 72 hours after treatment. An additional 3 arteries per group were assessed for collagenase effects at 24 hours after treatment. Successful guide wire crossings were significantly higher in collagenase-treated arteries (13 of 21, 62%) than in placebo-treated arteries (7 of 24, 29%) (P=0.028). No adverse effects on arterial structure were observed in collagenase-treated arteries. At 24 hours, collagenase-treated arteries demonstrated increased collagenase protein, gelatinase activity, and collagen fragments. CONCLUSIONS: Local delivery of collagenase can safely facilitate guide wire crossing of CTO. This novel approach could lead to higher percutaneous coronary intervention success rates in CTO.",M2
12673167,"Intra-arterial radionuclide therapy for liver tumours: effect of selectivity of catheterization and 131I-Lipiodol delivery on tumour uptake and response.Several authors have demonstrated the good tolerance of hepatic intra-arterial 131I-Lipiodol therapy and report survival rates of 21-25% after 1 year in inoperable patients. This study explored the possibility that more selective hepatic arterial instillation could be a strategy for increasing tumoural uptake and response of 131I-Lipiodol. Between June 1999 and September 2001 we selected 24 patients: 14 received a selective instillation of 131I-Lipiodol to the proper hepatic artery (SEL group); and 10 received a hyperselective instillation in the right or left hepatic artery (HYP-SEL group). The individual 131I-Lipiodol activity as a per cent of the injected activity per millilitre of tumour (%<e>IA</e>/ml tumour) was correlated with the selectivity of instillation in 28 tumours and with tumour response in 24 tumours. Differences in tumour response or tumour uptake between the SEL and HYP-SEL groups were not significant. In general, we observed a %IA/ml tumour of 0.05-2.6% for the uptake of 131I-Lipiodol. The uptake was significantly higher in responsive disease than in stable or progressive disease (P=0.002). A large tumour volume was invariably related to low uptake of 131I-Lipiodol and progressive disease (P=0.008). In conclusion, our study does not support the general use of hyper-selective or super-selective intra-arterial administration of 131I-Lipiodol. This result may be extrapolated to similar types of intra-arterial, loco-regional hepatic radionuclide therapy.",M2
12659676,"Ultrasound-guided percutaneous delivery of adenoviral vectors encoding the beta-galactosidase and human factor IX genes to early gestation fetal sheep in utero.In utero gene therapy may provide treatment of genetic diseases before significant organ damage, allow permanent genetic correction by reaching stem cell populations, and provide immune tolerance against the therapeutic transgenes and vectors. We have used percutaneous ultrasound-guided injection as a minimally invasive fetal procedure. First-generation adenoviruses encoding the nuclear localizing beta-galactosidase reporter gene or the human factor IX (hFIX) gene, or colloidal carbon were delivered via the umbilical vein (UV, n = 4), heart (intracardiac [IC], n = 2), liver parenchyma (intrahepatic [HE], n = 11), peritoneal cavity (intraperitoneal [IP], n = 14), skeletal musculature ([intramuscular [IM], n = 11), or the amniotic cavity (intraamniotic [<e>IA</e>], n = 14) to early-gestation fetal sheep (0.3 gestation = day 33-61). Postmortem analysis was performed at 2, 9, or 28 days after injection. Although fetal survival was between 77% and 91% for IP, HE, IA, and IM routes, no fetuses survived UV or IC procedures. The hFIX levels reaching 1900 and 401 ng/ml (IP), 30 ng/ml (HE), 66.5 and 39 ng/ml (IA), and 83 and 65.5 ng/ml (IM), respectively, were determined 2 days after injection and decreased at birth to 16.5 ng/ml (IP), 7 ng/ml (HE), 4.5 ng/ml (IA), and 4 and 0 ng/ml (IM). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry showed broadest hFIX transgene spread and highest localised beta-galactosidase expression, respectively, after IP administration. Antibodies were observed against vector but not against hFIX.",M2
12536235,"Intra-arterial administration of TNF-alpha followed by arterial ablation is an effective therapy for a regionally confined TNF-resistant rat mammary adenocarcinoma.Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is an immunomodulatory cytokine that has exhibited anti-tumor activity in a variety of experimental systems. However, the toxicities associated with systemic administration of TNF-alpha have limited its clinical utility and have led to the investigation of targeted delivery techniques with the ability to present the TNF-alpha dose directly to the vascular bed of the tumor. The intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) administration of TNF-alpha to patients with liver metastases represents one such approach, and recent work suggests that subsequent ablation of the tumor's arterial supply via embolization may enhance the efficacy of intra-arterial treatments (hepatic chemoembolization). The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that IA administration of TNF-alpha is superior to the intravenous (IV) route for inhibition of tumor growth in a regionally confined rat mammary adenocarcinoma model that provides for ablation of the arterial supply to the tumor following cytokine therapy. Rats bearing hind limb mammary adenocarcinomas received single IA or IV infusions of 8 x 10(5), 1 x 10(6), and 1.5 x 10(6) units of TNF-alpha via the common femoral artery (CFA) followed 1 h later by ligation of the artery. Control animals received either no treatment or IA infusion of 2% normal rat serum (NRS) followed by ipsilateral CFA ligation. Tumor size was measured every other day after treatment. Tumor growth inhibition occurred in the first 5 to 10 days after treatment. IV administration of TNF-alpha did not result in visual tumor necrosis or significant reduction in the rate of tumor growth. IA administration of TNF-alpha resulted in statistically significant diminution of tumor size as compared to untreated controls and animals receiving IA 2% normal rat serum (NRS; P&lt;0.05 at days 6, 8 and 10), regardless of the dose employed. The maximum growth inhibition with IA TNF-alpha was a 91% reduction in tumor volume that was achieved with a dose of 1 x 10(6) U TNF-alpha. These results demonstrate improved anti-tumor activity with the IA administration of TNF-alpha over the IV route in a regionally confined mammary adenocarcinoma. IA administration of biologic response modifiers like TNF-alpha may therefore be a useful approach for the hepatic chemoembolization of breast adenocarcinomas metastatic to the liver.",M2

After the second course of chemotherapy and before the third cycle they also received concomitant radiotherapy, consisting of a median dose of 56.5 Gy. There were 3 (21.4%) partial responses and 11 (78.6%) disease stabilizations in group A. There were 5 (33%) partial responses and 10 disease stabilizations in group B. Time to tumor progression was 5.2 and 5.8 months for IA and IV treatment respectively. Median survival time was 18.3 months for arm A patients and 18.6 for arm B patients. Our IA chemotherapy schedule has produced no conclusive evidence of benefit compared with intravenous treatment. Moreover, its cost-benefit ratio is not good enough to justify its continued pursuit.",M2
12427602,"ATP stimulates chemically sensitive and sensitizes mechanically sensitive afferents.We examined whether ATP stimulation of P2X purinoceptors would raise blood pressure in decerebrate cats. Femoral arterial injection of the P2X receptor agonist alpha,beta-methylene ATP into the blood supply of the triceps surae muscle induced a dose-dependent increase in arterial blood pressure. The maximal increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) evoked by 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mM alpha,beta-methylene ATP (0.5 ml/min injection rate) was 6.2 +/- 2.5, 22.5 +/- 4.4, and 35.2 +/- 3.9 mmHg, respectively. The P2X receptor antagonist pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (2 mM <e>ia</e>) attenuated the increase in MAP elicited by intra-arterial alpha,beta-methylene ATP (0.5 mM), whereas the P2Y receptor antagonist reactive blue 2 (2 mM ia) did not affect the MAP response to alpha,beta-methylene ATP. In a second group of experiments, we tested the hypothesis that ATP acting through P2X receptors would sensitize muscle afferents and, thereby, augment the blood pressure response to muscle stretch. Two kilograms of muscle stretch evoked a 26.5 +/- 4.3 mmHg increase in MAP. This MAP response was enhanced when 2 mM ATP or 0.1 mM alpha,beta-methylene ATP (0.5 ml/min) was arterially infused 10 min before muscle stretch. Furthermore, this effect of ATP on the pressor response to stretch was attenuated by 2 mM pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (P &lt; 0.05) but not by the P1 purinoceptor antagonist 8-(p-sulfophenyl)-theophylline (2 mM). These data indicate that activation of ATP-sensitive P2X receptors evokes a skeletal muscle afferent-mediated pressor response and that ATP at relatively low doses enhances the muscle pressor response to stretch via engagement of P2X receptors.",M2
12383416,"The efficacy of papaverine administration by different routes for the treatment of experimental acute cerebral vasospasm.OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of papaverine (PPV) by different routes of administration for the treatment of experimental acute cerebral vasospasm. METHODS: A rabbit model of acute cerebral vasospasm induced by autologous blood injected into the basilar and prepontine cistern was used. The PPV (2mg/kg) was injected either by an intravenous (IV), intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>), intra-cisternal (IC), or combination of intra-arterial and intra-cisternal (IA+IC) routes. Basilar artery diameters were measured before and after vasospasm was induced and after PPV treatment. RESULTS: Induction of vasospasm reduced basilar artery diameters by more than 50% in all animals. Compared to artery diameters before vasospasm, diameters after PPV treatment via the IV route were only reduced by 0.5+/-4.7%. Other reductions in the diameter included 29.1+/-10.4%, about 1.8+/-3.1%, and about 26.7+/-8.4% in the IA, IC, and IA+IC groups, respectively. However, IA administration of PPV caused obvious side effects. CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial application of the PPV was the most effective way to treat vasospasm in this study. The efficacy of IC route in our study did not confirm the results of prior study. The possibility of side effects of PPV via the IA route should be considered before clinical application.",M2
12181180,"Mesenteric afferent nerves are sensitive to vascular perfusion in a novel preparation of rat ileum in vitro.Using novel in vitro preparations of vascularly perfused rat ileum, we investigated mesenteric afferent sensitivity to vascular perfusion. Gut (GPP) and vascular (VPP) perfusion pressures were recorded simultaneously with afferent discharge (AD). After preconstriction (L-phenylephrine), capsaicin (100 microM, gut lumen) caused a transient increase in AD and a sustained fall in VPP, supporting afferent modulation of vascular tone. In turn, AD was affected by vascular perfusion rate (VPR). Increasing VPR step-wise (0.6 to 1.0, 1.4 and 1.8 ml/min) caused concomitant falls in AD, returning at 0.6 ml/min. Terminating flow (5 min) increased AD. Afferent responses were independent of changes in GPP, vascular O2, or the gut  tube  ( gut-off ). In gut-off studies, where capsaicin (100 nM <e>ia</e>) still reduced VPP, flow-associated falls in AD were abolished by the enzyme neuraminidase (0.2 U/ml ia or extravascularly over 20 min). In contrast, increased AD after stopped flow was unaffected. We propose that mesenteric afferents  sense  changes in vascular perfusion. The precise stimuli (pressure and/or flow) and the physiological relevance to control of local circulation remain to be determined.",M2
11949830,"Intra-arterial carboplatin and intravenous etoposide for the treatment of recurrent and progressive non-GBM gliomas.Recurrent and progressive non-GBM gliomas are a diverse group of brain tumors that often respond poorly to adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Regional intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) administration of chemotherapy may result in increased tumor uptake of drug, with improvement in response rates and time to progression (TTP). Twenty-five patients with recurrent or progressive non-GBM gliomas were treated with IA carboplatin (200 mg/m2/d) and intravenous (IV) etoposide (100 mg/m2/d) for 2 days every 4 weeks. Patients ranged in age from 22 to 68 years (mean 37.8). All but one patient had received standard irradiation, and eight patients had attempted prior chemotherapy. Five of 25 patients had objective responses (20%), while another 15 patients had stable disease (60%), receiving a total of 318 IA treatment procedures. There was one complete response (4.0%), three partial responses (12.0%), one minor response (4.0%), 15 stable diseases (60.0%), and five progressive diseases (20.0%). The median TTP was 24.2 weeks overall and 32 weeks in responders. Overall median survival was 34.2 weeks. Therapy was well tolerated, with mainly hematologic toxicity. Two patients had embolic complications. Although these are preliminary results, IA carboplatin and IV etoposide have modest activity against recurrent and progressive non-GBM gliomas and warrants further study.",M2
11918370,"Validation of injection parameters for catheter-directed intraarterial gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Catheter-directed intraarterial (<e>IA</e>) injections of gadolinium contrast agents may be used during endovascular interventions with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging guidance. Injection protocols require further validation. Using a flow phantom and swine, the authors aimed to (a) measure the optimal arterial gadolinium concentration ([Gd]) required for MR angiography and (b) validate a proposed IA injection protocol for gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For in vitro experiments, the authors placed a catheter in the aorta of an aorto-renal-iliac flow phantom. Injected [Gd], injection rates, and aortic blood flow rates were varied independently for 36 separate IA gadolinium injections. The authors performed 2D and 3D MR angiography with a fast spoiled gradient-recalled echo sequence. For subsequent in vivo experiments, they selectively placed catheters within the aorta, renal artery, or common iliac artery of three pigs. Injection rate and injected [Gd] were varied. The authors performed 32 separate IA gadolinium injections for 2D MR angiography. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were compared for the various combinations of injection rate and injected [Gd]. RESULTS: In vitro, an arterial [Gd] of 2%-4% produced an optimal SNR for 2D MR angiography, and 3%-5% was best for 3D MR angiography. In swine, an arterial [Gd] of 1%-4% produced an optimal SNR. In the phantom and swine experiments, SNR was maintained at higher injection rates by inversely varying the injected [Gd]. CONCLUSION: Dilute arterial [Gd] is required for optimal IA gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography. To maintain an optimal SNR, injection rates and injected [Gd] should be varied inversely. The postulated injection protocol was validated.",M2
11872894,"Predictors of hemorrhagic transformation in patients receiving intra-arterial thrombolysis.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a major complication of intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) thrombolytic therapy. Identifying significant predictors of hemorrhage after thrombolysis would be useful in guiding patient selection for IA treatment. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively on consecutive patients with acute focal cerebral ischemia within the anterior or posterior circulation who were treated with combined intravenous (IV)-IA or pure IA thrombolysis over an 8-year period at the UCLA Medical Center. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were treated. Median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 16, and mean age was 69 years. Twenty-six patients received IA tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) only, 22 received IV-IA tPA, and 41 received IA urokinase only. Asymptomatic HT occurred in 29 patients (33%), minor symptomatic HT (1- to 3-point worsening in NIHSS score) occurred in 10 patients (11%), and major symptomatic HT (&gt; or = 4-point worsening in NIHSS score) occurred in 6 patients (7%). The rate of any HT was similar in patients treated with pure IA thrombolysis (39%) versus combined IV-IA thrombolysis (41%). In pure IA cases, the rate of any HT was 50% with tPA versus 32% with urokinase (P=0.2). Eighty-six percent of the patients with HT versus 39% of the patients without HT were dead or disabled (modified Rankin score &gt;2) at day 7 (P&lt;0.0001). On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of any HT were higher NIHSS score, longer time to recanalization, lower platelet count, and higher glucose level. A model using these variables correctly predicted HT with positive predictive value 70% and overall accuracy 78%. CONCLUSIONS: In this large series of IA thrombolysis, rates of HT were similar to those demonstrated in prior series and clinical trials. Higher NIHSS score, longer time to recanalization, lower platelet count, and higher glucose level were independent predictors of any HT.",M2
11793457,"Minimizing contrast agent dose during intraarterial gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography: in vitro assessment.PURPOSE: To minimize contrast agent dosage for intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) by examining the effects of encoding order (elliptical vs. sequential) and injection duration (100% to 30% of the acquisition time). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Catheter-based IA gadolinium (Gd) injections were performed in an arterial flow phantom. Blood flow rates, injection rates, and injection durations were systematically varied. Signal-to-noise (SNR) measurements were obtained in the aorta, renal artery, and common iliac artery. RESULTS: No significant SNR losses were observed for any of the vessels with 75% injection duration, or for the aorta and iliac artery with 50% injection duration. Excellent images of all vessels were obtained at 50% injection duration. There was no significant SNR difference between encoding schemes. CONCLUSION: Contrast agent dosage can be substantially reduced without loss of SNR by limiting injection to part of the imaging acquisition time.",M2
11552057,"Intra-arterial thrombolysis.Intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) thrombolysis is an emerging treatment strategy for acute ischemic stroke. In IA thrombolysis, the cervicocephalic arterial tree is traversed with an endovascular microcatheter delivery system, the catheter port is positioned immediately within and adjacent to the offending thrombus, and fibrinolytic agents are infused directly into the clot. This delivery technique permits high concentrations of lytic agent to be applied to the clot while minimizing systemic exposure. Early open series suggested that IA thrombolysis achieves higher recanalization rates than i.v. thrombolysis. The first randomized Phase III trial of IA thrombolysis, the Prolyse in Acute Cerebral Thromboembolism II (PROACT II) trial, confirmed this promise, showing that IA therapy begun up to 6 hours after symptom onset was associated with higher recanalization rates and better clinical outcomes, with acceptable hemorrhage rates. MRI studies have provided striking imaging evidence of the potential beneficial effects of IA therapy, showing not only rescue of regions of diffusion-perfusion mismatch but also normalization and salvage of some tissues with pretreatment bioenergetic failure evidenced by early diffusion abnormality. The Emergency Management of Stroke Bridging Trial demonstrated the feasibility of combined i.v. and intra-arterial thrombolysis. Intra-arterial thrombolysis is a promising treatment strategy for acute ischemic stroke. In coming years, IA thrombolysis, alone or in combination with endovascular mechanical reperfusion techniques, is likely to be increasingly refined and validated and to become a widely accepted therapy for acute ischemic stroke.",M2

METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with carotid artery distribution strokes were evaluated and treated using a combined IV and IA rtPA approach over a 14-month period (September 1998 to October 1999). rtPA (0.6 mg/kg) was given intravenously (maximum dose 60 mg); 15% of the IV dose was given as bolus, followed by a continuous infusion over 30 minutes. A maximal IA dose, up to 0.3 mg/kg or 24 mg, whichever was less, was given over a maximum of 2 hours. IV treatment was initiated within 3 hours in 19 of 20 patients. All 20 patients underwent angiography, and 16 of 20 patients received local IA rtPA. RESULTS: The median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score for the 20 patients was 21 (range 11 to 31). The median time from stroke onset to IV treatment was 2 hours and 2 minutes, and median time to initiation of IA treatment was 3 hours and 30 minutes. Ten patients (50%) recovered to a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0 or 1; 3 patients (15%), to an mRS of 2; and 5 patients (25%), to an mRS of 4 or 5. One patient (5%) developed a symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and eventually died. One other patient (5%) expired because of complications from the stroke. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the greater-than-expected proportion of favorable outcomes in these patients with severe ischemic stroke reflects the short time to initiation of both IV and IA thrombolysis.",M2
10941154,"High-dose intra-arterial cisplatin and concurrent hyperfractionated radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: report of a phase II study.BACKGROUND: This phase II study evaluates the tolerability and efficacy of concurrent hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HFX-RT) and high-dose intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) cisplatin in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). METHODS: Between December 1995 and November 1997, 20 patients with locally advanced T4/T3 SCCHN were treated with HFX-RT (76.8-79.2 Gy at 1.2 Gy bid over 6-7 weeks) and high-dose IA cisplatin (150 mg/m(2) given at the start of RT boost treatment [start of week 6]). Seventeen patients (85%) had T4 disease, and 14 (70%) had N2/ N3 disease. RESULTS: Grade 3-5 acute toxicity was limited to one grade 4 (5%) and 14 grade 3 (70%) mucosal events. No grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity was observed. Median weight loss during therapy was 9% (range, 2%-16%). Eighteen patients had complete response (90%) at the primary site; 14 were confirmed pathologically. Among 17 patients with positive neck disease, 16 (94%) achieved complete response in the neck, including 12 of 13 patients with N2/N3 disease who underwent planned neck dissection. Active follow-up ranges from 12 to 32 months (median, 20 months) with 11 patients alive without disease, 5 dead of disease, and 4 dead of intercurrent disease. Eighteen patients (90%) remained disease free at the primary site, and the locoregional control rate is 80%. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose IA cisplatin and concurrent HFX-RT as used in this study is feasible and warrants further investigation. The high complete response rate and low grade 4 toxicity in this highly unfavorable subset of patients appears better than previously reported chemoradiation regimens for more favorable patients.",M2
10843895,"Efficacy and specificity of bFGF increased collateral flow in experimental peripheral arterial insufficiency.Angiogenic growth factors could prove to be useful in managing peripheral arterial insufficiency. The present study was designed to evaluate the dose response of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), the efficacy of critical routes and dosing regimens, and the specificity of action in rats with peripheral arterial insufficiency. Bilateral ligation of femoral arteries greatly reduces blood flow capacity to the calf muscles but does not impair resting flow needs. Collateral blood flow to calf muscles was determined 16 days postocclusion, during treadmill running, with (85)Sr and (141)Ce microspheres, in blinded-randomized trials that included intra-arterial and intravenous infusions and subcutaneous injections of recombinant human bFGF. Peak blood flow of 75-80 ml. min(-1). 100 g(-1) for calf muscle was observed at a bFGF dose of 5 microg. kg(-1). day(-1) (<e>ia</e> for 14 days) compared with 50 ml. min(-1). 100 g(-1) for vehicle groups. Similar increases in collateral blood flow were observed with short-term or prolonged and continuous or intermittent delivery of bFGF by any route. Collateral blood flows were similar in corresponding muscles across both limbs. Vascular remodeling induced by bFGF required attendant vascular occlusion, inasmuch as vessels in the normal nonoccluded vascular tree were unresponsive to circulating bFGF. Improvement in collateral blood flow with exogenous bFGF is robust, amenable to short-term administration, and requires vascular occlusion to be effective.",M2
10642338,"A nonpeptide mimic of bradykinin blunts the development of hypertension in young spontaneously hypertensive rats.We tested whether FR190997, a nonpeptide B(2) agonist, prevented the development of hypertension in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which secrete less kallikrein into the urine than do Wistar-Kyoto rats. An intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) injection of FR190997 (0.3 to 30 nmol/kg) caused dose-dependent hypotension in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats. Although the maximum hypotensive potency of FR190997 equaled that of bradykinin, its action lasted approximately 10 times as long. Hoe140 (100 nmol/kg IA) significantly blocked the hypotensive response induced by FR190997 (10 nmol/kg). Atropine (100 nmol/kg IA) did not affect this response. A selective infusion of FR190997 into the renal artery induced natriuresis and diuresis in anesthetized rabbits. A continuous infusion (2 nmol. 10 mL(-1). h(-1) per rat) of FR190997 into the abdominal aorta of young SHR (6 weeks old, n=6) for 6 days significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced mean blood pressure to 114+/-6 (day 2) and 110+/-6 (day 5) mm Hg, from 149+/-7 and 162+/-6 mm Hg, respectively, in vehicle-infused rats (n=6). At 8 days after continuous infusion (day 14), mean blood pressure (148+/-5 mm Hg) in FR190997-infused rats remained significantly (P&lt;0. 05) lower than that in vehicle-infused rats (190+/-6 mm Hg), almost the peak value. The mesenteric artery isolated from FR190997-treated rats (day 14) had lower contractile sensitivity to norepinephrine than that from vehicle-treated rats. These results suggested that the continuous infusion of a nonpeptide B(2) agonist may prevent hypertension if performed in the critical phase.",M2
10564140,"Effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 on interstitial fluid pressure in rat skin.Interstitial fluid pressure (P(if)) decreases in several experimental models of acute inflammation, enhancing edema formation. The present study was designed to determine the effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1beta as well as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on P(if) in a model of gram-negative sepsis. P(if) was measured in the paw skin of anesthetized rats (pentobarbital sodium, 50 mg/kg ip) using micropipettes (3-7 micrometer) and servo-controlled counterpressure technique. Test substances were injected intra-arterially (<e>ia</e>), intravenously (iv), or subdermally (sd). After intra-arterial or intravenous administration, the test substances were circulated for 1 min before circulatory arrest was induced with an intravenous injection of KCl while the rats were under pentobarbital anesthesia. Circulatory arrest was induced to avoid edema formation, which would raise interstitial fluid volume to cause a more positive P(if). Administration of 0.5 ml of LPS (5 mg/ml ia) lowered P(if) significantly from control values of -0.2 +/- 0.3 to -2.0 +/- 0.3 mmHg (P &lt; 0.05) within 1 h. Corresponding values for TNF-alpha (500 ng/ml iv) were -0.4 +/- 0.2 to -2.3 +/- 0.1 mmHg (P &lt; 0.05). Administration of 5 microliter (5 mg/ml sd) of LPS did not affect P(if) significantly (P &gt; 0.05), but TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 had a significant effect on P(if) when given subdermally. IL-6 (50 ng/ml) caused a decrease in P(if) from control values of -1.2 +/- 0.3 to -2. 8 +/- 0.5 mmHg (P &lt; 0.05) within 1 h. The experiments demonstrate that LPS, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 induce lowering of P(if) when given intravenously or intra-arterially, whereas only TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 induce lowering of P(if) when given subdermally. We therefore suggest that the lowering of P(if) in this experimental model of sepsis is related to the release of and a local effect in skin of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6.",M2
9843801,"Reflex pressor response to arterial phenylbiguanide: role of abdominal sympathetic visceral afferents.Phenylbiguanide (PBG), a 5-HT3 (serotonin) receptor agonist, has been used in many studies as a  selective  agonist to elicit reflex bradycardia and hypotension through activation of cardiac and pulmonary vagal afferents. Because we have shown that endogenous 5-HT stimulates ischemically sensitive abdominal sympathetic afferents through 5-HT3 receptors, we investigated the possibility that left ventricular (LV) and intra-arterial administration of PBG may evoke a competing reflex response by increasing the activity of sympathetic visceral afferents in anesthetized cats. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored. When both vagal and sympathetic afferents were intact, PBG (40 microgram/kg, injected into the LV) significantly decreased MAP and HR in 8 of 10 cats but increased MAP in the remaining 2 cats. After bilateral cervical vagotomy, LV PBG significantly increased MAP. PBG (40 microgram/kg <e>ia</e>) significantly increased MAP and HR, whereas intravenous PBG significantly decreased MAP and HR (n = 10 cats). Furthermore, the pressor response to PBG (40 microgram /kg ia) was reduced by 68% (P &lt; 0.05; n = 4 cats) by celiac and mesenteric ganglionectomies. In studies of single-unit abdominal sympathetic afferents, intra-arterial but not intravenous PBG (40 microgram/kg) significantly increased activity of 10 ischemically sensitive afferents but not ischemically insensitive afferents. Blockade of 5-HT3 receptors with tropisetron (200 microgram/kg iv) eliminated the response of the afferents and the pressor response to PBG. These data indicate that PBG administered into the LV usually, but not always, evokes a depressor response that is converted to a pressor response following cervical vagotomy. Also, intra-arterial PBG induces a pressor response by stimulating 5-HT3 receptors largely associated with ischemically sensitive abdominal sympathetic afferents.",M2
9631632,"Intra-arterial papaverine treatment for cerebral vasospasm: our experience and review of the literature.We described the techniques and efficacy of intra-arterial papaverine hydrochloride infusion (<e>IA</e>-PAP) for symptomatic vasospasm due to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage based on our experience and review of the literature. Angiographic improvement occurred almost always, but only 50% of patients who presented with acute symptoms showed remarkable clinical improvement after the first, second, or third IA-PAP. Recurrent vasospasm after IA-PAP frequently occurred and this seems to be an apparent source of controversy regarding its efficacy. Review of the literature indicates that IA-PAP may be most effective in combination with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Further controlled studies should be conducted regarding papaverine's true efficacy including most effective papaverine concentration and rate of infusion, maximum total dose, site of infusion, timing of treatment, and selection of patients.",M2
9525819,"Phase II study of intracarotid or selective intracerebral infusion of cisplatin for treatment of recurrent anaplastic gliomas.PURPOSE: To assess the response of patients with recurrent malignant gliomas to intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) cisplatin. METHODS: Eligibility criteria included patients with recurrent supratentorial malignant gliomas and measurable, unilateral contrast-enhancing tumor located within the territory of one or two major cerebral arteries. Patients received 75 mg/m2 IA cisplatin every four weeks. Depending on individual patients' tumor topography, cisplatin was infused either into the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) (15 patients), or into one or two major cerebral arteries (26 patients), most often the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery. RESULTS: Of 40 patients evaluable for tumor response, four patients (10%) were responders and nine patients (22%) had disease stabilization. The median time to tumor progression among the 13 patients with tumor response or stable disease was 23.7 weeks. The response rate did not significantly differ between patients receiving ICA versus selective intracerebral infusion, although the latter group contained a higher proportion of glioblastoma. Tumor progression occurred solely as local failure in 33 patients (82%), with all enhancing tumor still located within the vascular territory infused with IA cisplatin. Ipsilateral vision loss occurred in two patients after ICA cisplatin but in none of the selective infusion patients. Seizures and/or transient or permanent neurologic deterioration occurred in four patients (27%) after ICA cisplatin and in 11 patients (44%) after selective intracerebral infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Although this was not a randomized comparison, selective intracerebral artery cisplatin infusion in this group of patients reduced the risk of eye toxicity, but did not produce a better tumor response rate, and carried a higher risk of neurotoxicity relative to ICA infusion.",M2
9468210,"Vitamin C improves endothelial function of conduit arteries in patients with chronic heart failure.BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is associated with endothelial dysfunction including impaired endothelium-mediated, flow-dependent dilation (FDD). There is evidence for increased radical formation in CHF, raising the possibility that nitric oxide is inactivated by radicals, thereby impairing endothelial function. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of the antioxidant vitamin C on FDD in patients with CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS: High-resolution ultrasound and Doppler was used to measure radial artery diameter and blood flow in 15 patients with CHF and 8 healthy volunteers. Vascular effects of vitamin C (25 mg/min <e>IA</e>) and placebo were determined at rest and during reactive hyperemia (causing endothelium-mediated dilation) before and after intra-arterial infusion of N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) to inhibit endothelial synthesis of nitric oxide. Vitamin C restored FDD in patients with heart failure after acute intra-arterial administration (13.2+/-1.7% versus 8.2+/-1.0%; P&lt;.01) and after 4 weeks of oral therapy (11.9+/-0.9% versus 8.2+/-1.0%; P&lt;.05). In particular, the portion of FDD mediated by nitric oxide (ie, inhibited by L-NMMA) was increased after acute as well as after chronic treatment (CHF baseline: 4.2+/-0.7%; acute: 9.1+/-1.3%; chronic: 7.3+/-1.2%; normal subjects: 8.9+/-0.8%; P&lt;.01). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C improves FDD in patients with CHF as the result of increased availability of nitric oxide. This observation supports the concept that endothelial dysfunction in patients with CHF is, at least in part, due to accelerated degradation of nitric oxide by radicals.",M2
9406123,"Vagal and sympathetic influences on the ferret lower oesophageal sphincter.This study has investigated the relative involvement of cholinergic, adrenergic, nitric oxide and tachykininergic transmission in extrinsic neural influences on the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) in urethane anaesthetized ferrets. A micromanometric assembly (OD 1.75 mm) incorporating a sleeve sensor was used for high-fidelity oesophageal, LOS and gastric pressure measurement at low perfusion rates (&lt; 0.1 ml/min). The LOS response to vagal and splanchnic nerve stimulation (0.5 ms pulse width, 10 s duration) was frequency- and voltage-dependent. LOS responses to stimulation at 20 V, 10 Hz were investigated in separate groups of animals with either L-NAME (100 mg/kg), hexamethonium (15 mg/kg), guanethidine (5 mg/kg), CP96,345 (NK-1 antagonist, 4 mg/kg), atropine (0.4 mg/kg) or propranolol (1 mg/kg). Propranolol treatment was followed by yohimbine (1 mg/kg) and prazosin (0.25 mg/kg). Vagal stimulation caused an immediate decrease in LOS pressure, followed by increase on cessation of stimulation, followed by a prolonged decrease (77 +/- 2%) for up to 5 min. L-NAME did not affect inhibition, but increased excitation 4-fold (p &lt; 0.001). Guanethidine and CP96,345 had no major effect. Hexamethonium decreased the inhibitory (p &lt; 0.05) and excitatory (p &lt; 0.01) responses. Atropine reduced the excitatory response (p &lt; 0.05). Some inhibition still remained if all treatments were combined. Splanchnic stimulation reduced LOS pressure by 70 +/- 6% for 101 +/- 17 s. L-NAME, guanethidine, hexamethonium and CP96,345 all independently significantly reduced inhibition. The combination of guanethidine and CP96,345 usually abolished splanchnic-induced inhibition. Atropine was without effect. Propranolol (1 mg/kg) changed the splanchnic-induced response from mainly inhibition to excitation (100 +/- 44% increase). LOS responses to noradrenaline (1-10 micrograms close <e>IA</e>) showed similar features to responses to splanchnic stimulation. We conclude that vagal stimulation evokes LOS relaxation via activation of established cholinergic and NANC mechanisms and other, unidentified mechanisms. Splanchnic stimulation activates adrenergic neurones probably via nicotinic and non-nicotinic ganglionic mechanisms, which in turn elicit beta adrenergic inhibitory effects on the LOS. Splanchnic stimulation also antidromically activates spinal afferent fibres. These may release substance P from peripheral myenteric plexus and prevertebral ganglionic endings causing activation of myenteric NANC inhibitory neurones and sympathetic neurones, respectively.",M2
8853303,"Pharmacokinetics of intraarterial mitomycin C in the chemoembolisation treatment of liver metastases.1. The pharmacokinetics of mitomycin C (MMC) were investigated in 12 colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases undergoing chemoembolisation. Hepatic artery branches were embolized using polyvinylalcohol microspheres (150-250 microns) before applying 20 mg MMC in 4-8 min. 2. Serum MMC concentrations were determined from peripheral venous blood samples by reverse-phase HPLC using ultraviolet detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters were computed assuming an open two-compartment model. 3. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to values given in the literature for intravenous (IV) or intraarterial (<e>IA</e>) bolus MMC injections (Tmax = 7.0 min following the beginning of MMC infusion, Vss = 0.57 1/kg, C1 = 8.9 ml/min.kg, T1/2 alpha = 8.3 min, T1/2 beta = 58.6 min). 4. The area under the serum concentration-time-curve (AUC), standardized by the MMC amount injected, was similar to values reported in the literature for IV or IA bolus injections. There is no evidence for reduced systemic MMC exposure following the embolization procedure used.",M2

Preoperatively two cycles of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) were administered, followed 5 days later by CDP and Adriamycin (ADM). MTX and ADM were administered IV, and CDP was delivered IA or IV. Postoperatively, good responders received 3 more cycles of the same drugs, while poor responders had a longer chemotherapy including ifosfamide. The rate of good histological response to chemotherapy was significantly higher in patients treated intraarterially (78% vs 46%: P &lt; .004), while no significant differences in terms of disease-free survival were observed between patients who received CDP IA and patients who received CDP IV (55% vs 51%). In the IA group, however, there was only one local recurrence vs 5 in the IV group. The IA infusion of CDP is more active on the primary tumor than the IV infusion.",M2
8560474,"Toxicokinetics of parathion and paraoxon in rainbow trout after intravascular administration and water exposure.Fish are less sensitive than mammals to organophosphate insecticide toxicity. The species differences have been mainly investigated by biochemical studies of AChE and organophosphate interaction. To examine whether species differences in the toxicokinetics of the organophosphate insecticides were also involved in their differential toxicity, rainbow trout were fitted with a dorsal aorta cannula and administered parathion and its active metabolite paraoxon intraarterially (<e>ia</e>) and via water exposure. Serial blood samples were removed and the plasma concentrations of parathion and paraoxon were determined by capillary GC with EC detection. Plasma protein binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis and ultrafiltration. After ia injection the plasma concentration-time profiles of parathion and paraoxon were multiexponential, with a terminal t1/2 of 56.1 and 0.528 hr. The steady-state volumes of distribution and total body clearances (CLb) for parathion and paraoxon were 1370 and 1080 ml kg-1 and 21.4 and 3020 ml hr-1 kg-1; the plasma unbound fractions were 1.23 and 52.5%. The large difference in CLb between parathion and paraoxon appeared to result primarily from differences in plasma protein binding. Parathion had greater persistence in trout than rat, suggesting that sensitivity difference were unrelated to toxicokinetic differences.",M2
7897693,"Physiologically based pharmacokinetic model useful in prediction of the influence of species, dose, and exposure route on perchloroethylene pharmacokinetics.The ability of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict the uptake and elimination of perchloroethylene (PCE) in venous blood was evaluated by comparison of model simulations with experimental data for two species, two routes of exposure, and three dosage levels. Unanesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats and beagle dogs were administered 1, 3, or 10 mg PCE/kg body weight in polyethylene glycol 400 as a single bolus, either by gavage or by intraarterial (<e>ia</e>) injection. Serial blood samples were obtained from a jugular vein cannula for up to 96 h following dosing. The PCE concentrations were analyzed by headspace gas chromatography. For each dose and route of administration, terminal elimination half-lives in rats were shorter than in dogs, and areas under the blood concentration-time curve were smaller in rats than in dogs. Over a 10-fold range of doses, PCE blood levels in the rat were well predicted by the PBPK model following ia administration, and slightly underpredicted following oral administration. The PCE concentrations in dog blood were generally overpredicted, except for fairly precise predictions for the 3 mg/kg oral dose. These studies provide experimental evidence of the utility of the PBPK model for PCE in interspecies, route-to-route, and dose extrapolations.",M2

METHODS: 311 adult patients (ages 19-79 years; median 45) with supratentorial tumors (confirmed histologically) were randomized by nine participating institutions. Patients were required to have completed radiotherapy (4500-6020 cGy to the tumor bed) before randomization. Patients were stratified as either nonprogressive (clinically and radiologically stable) or progressive. Results were analyzed for the 311 patients in the randomized population (RP), and for the 281 patients in the Valid Study Group (VSG) meeting protocol eligibility requirements. 56% of patients in the VSG had glioblastoma multiforme, 33% had other malignant glioma, and 11% had low-grade glioma. 64% were stratified as progressive. 12% had received prior chemotherapy. RESULTS: The group randomized to PCNU had the longer survival (p = 0.06 for the RP, p = 0.07 for the VSG). In the VSG, median survival was 10 months for the cisplatin group, 13 months for the PCNU group. The difference between treatment groups was significant (p &lt; or = 0.02) when adjusted for important prognostic factors. PCNU lead to greater hematotoxicity; cisplatin lead to greater renal toxicity and some ototoxicity. Some cisplatin patients experienced complications associated with IA administration, including six cases of encephalopathy. CONCLUSION: The trial showed a survival advantage to the group randomized to PCNU, although the difference was modest. Coupled with previous BTCG results, these trails suggest that PCNU is an active drug for brain tumors.",M2
7500799,"[Significance of therapy timing for the effects of systemic and local therapy with the ACE inhibitor captopril on intestinal microcirculation in manifest mesenteric ischemia. An animal experiment study in the swine]We present the results of a study based on an animal model concurring whether captopril can improve microcirculation in the small intestine in nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia dependent on when therapy is begun. Cardiogenic shock was produced by pericardial tamponade with starch solution. The flow in the carotid artery could be reduced to 43% of the preshock value. In four therapy groups and a control group the intestinal microcirculation was examined by laser Doppler flowmetry in the serosa and mucosa. The measurements were taken at regular intervals during the 4 h of the experiments. Captopril was either given systemically or locoregionally through the upper mesenteric artery. Therapy was given at the beginning of the shock or 1 h after induction of shock at a dosage of 0.25 mg/kg body weight as a bolus and continuous application of 10 micrograms/kg body wt. Concerning the hemodynamic changes during shock the group receiving captopril systemically at the beginning of shock showed a significant (P = 0.05) improvement in microcirculation compared to the controls and other therapy groups. Flow reduction was seen in the controls (156-32 relative flow units = RFU) in group <e>Ia</e> (systemic therapy 1 h after shock), as well as the controls (129 to 12 RFU) and, in group Ib (systemic therapy beginning with shock) a flow rise could be seen (307 to 481 RFU). In group IIa (local therapy 1 h after shock) (a steady flow was seen (168-170 RFU) and in group IIb (local therapy beginning with shock) and group Ib an increase in flow was also measured (226-303 RFU). This positive effect of captopril on the intestinal perfusion was observed when applied 1 h after the induction of shock.",M2
8079354,"Development of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for perchloroethylene using tissue concentration-time data.The tissue disposition of perchloroethylene (PCE) was characterized experimentally in rats in order to (1) obtain input parameters from in vivo data for the development of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, and (2) use the PBPK model to predict the deposition of PCE in a variety of tissues following inhalation exposure. For the derivation of model input parameters, male Sprague-Dawley rats received a single bolus of 10 mg PCE/kg body wt in polyethylene glycol 400 by <e>ia</e> injection through an indwelling carotid arterial cannula. Other male Sprague-Dawley rats inhaled 500 ppm PCE for 2 hr in dynamic exposure inhalation chambers. Serial samples of brain, liver, kidney, lung, heart, skeletal muscle, perirenal fat, and blood were taken for up to 72 hr following ia injection, during the 2-hr inhalation exposure, and for up to 72 hr postexposure. Blood and tissue PCE concentrations were analyzed using a gas chromatography headspace technique. Following ia administration, the tissues exhibited similar terminal elimination half-lives (t1/2). As comparable tissue t1/2 are consistent with a blood-flow-limited model, tissue:blood partition coefficients were calculated for noneliminating compartments by division of the area under the tissue concentration-time curve (AUC) by the blood AUC. Liver PCE concentration versus time data were employed in the calculation of in vivo metabolic rate constants. A PBPK model was developed using these parameters derived from the ia data set and used to predict tissue PCE concentrations during and following PCE inhalation. Predicted tissue levels were in close agreement with the levels measured over time in the seven tissues and in blood. Tissue concentration-time data can thus provide valuable input for parameter estimation and for validation of PBPK model simulations, as long as independent in vivo data sets are used for each step.",M2
7525024,"Autonomic and sensory cardiovascular activities of nonivamide: intrathecal administration of clonidine.The effects of nonivamide on the cardiovascular system were examined and compared with the effects of substance P (SP) in rats. Intravenous (i.v.) injection (10 micrograms/kg) of nonivamide produced triphasic pressure responses (A; depressor, B; pressor, and C; depressor) and biphasic bradycardia responses (f; fast bradycardia and s; slow bradycardia). <e>IA</e> injection (10 micrograms/kg) into the epigastric artery caused hypotension and mild tachycardia. The effects of atropine, vagotomy, SP antagonist, propranolol, and clonidine on these responses were examined and mechanisms responsible for the nonivamide-induced responses are postulated as follows. A and f are due to vagal reflex resulting from the excitation of afferent sensory neurons in the heart and are parasympathetic efferent effects from the nucleus solitarius. B is involved in sympathetic activation, partly caused by the release of SP in the spinal cord. C is due to the vasodilatory effect of SP released from perivascular stores. s was diminished by vagotomy and is due to the bradycardiac effect of acetylcholine, released by SP, from cardiac stores. The activation of the autonomic system is inhibited by clonidine and involved in the wide spectrum of nonivamide-induced cardiovascular effects.",M2

A total of 98 patients with nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing segmental Lp-TAE (Seg-Lp-TAE) were studied, and the relationship between the CT pattern observed after Seg-Lp-TAE (Seg-Lp-CT) and the therapeutic results obtained in those patients was evaluated. Seg-Lp-CT was classified into four types (type I, homogeneous; type II, defective; type III, inhomogeneous; and type IV, only slight accumulation, if any) according to the Lipiodol accumulation pattern observed after Seg-Lp-TAE. The cumulative nonrecurrence rates of type I were higher than those of types II-IV. The cumulative survival rates of type <e>Ia</e>, in which Lp accumulation is also seen around the main tumor, were the highest (93.8% at 1 year, 85.9% at 2 years, 85.9% at 3 years, and 57.3% at 4 years). The cumulative survival rates achieved with Seg-Lp-TAE were 89.2% at 1 year, 69.4% at 2 years, 58.9% at 3 years, 44.0% at 4 years, and 30.2% at 5 years, which were higher than those achieved with conventional Lp-TAE. Seg-Lp-TAE is very useful in the treatment of HCC limited to one sub-subsegment, subsegment, or segment, and it is important to choose sub-subsegmental, subsegmental, or segmental Lp-TAE on the basis of the size and site of the tumor as well as the type and the number of feeding arteries.",M2
8010058,"Fate of methotrexate albumin microspheres after hepatic intra-arterial injection in dogs.Methotrexate (MTX) albumin microspheres (40 microns) were injected into dog hepatic artery.

After <e>ia</e> MTX in microspheres the MTX levels in liver were higher than those after MTX in saline. The microsphere emboli were entrapped in the hepatic precapillary arterioles. Thrombi were found in hepatic arterioles, with microsphere constituting the core. Hence MTX microspheres hepatic intra-arterial injection may be an effective treatment for patients with liver neoplasms.",M2
8319168,"Enhancement of cytotoxicity of doxorubicin by verapamil in the hepatic artery infusion for liver tumors in rats.BACKGROUND: The calcium channel blocker has been demonstrated to be effective in the accumulation and retention of chemotherapeutic agents in tumor cells. METHODS: The effect of verapamil on cytotoxicity of doxorubicin was investigated in a hepatic artery infusion (HAI) for liver tumors of Walker 256 carcinosarcoma in rats. Doxorubicin was infused by way of a hepatic artery by a bolus injection intra-arterially (<e>IA</e>) (1 mg/kg) and a continuous infusion intra-arterially (CIA) (6 mg/kg/day for 6 days). RESULTS: Doxorubicin increased 90% and 66% in tumor tissue following HAI of verapamil by a bolus and continuous infusion (P &lt; 0.05), respectively. However, no enhancement of the accumulation of doxorubicin in the tumor tissue was found in an intravenous administration of verapamil. The CIA infusion of verapamil with doxorubicin inhibited the tumor growth by 73% in comparison with doxorubicin only (P &lt; 0.05). Verapamil administered intravenously (IV) could not induce this inhibitory effect. The CIA administration of verapamil reduced the serum concentration by 45% (P &lt; 0.001) in comparison with the CIV route. Furthermore, the administration of verapamil did not increase the accumulation of doxorubicin in the normal liver and heart tissues. No enhancement of bone marrow suppression and hepatic biochemical influence by doxorubicin was revealed by the concomitant use of verapamil. CONCLUSIONS: The continuous HAI of verapamil remarkably enhanced the cytotoxicity of HAI with doxorubicin for the treatment of hepatic tumor without aggravating the side effects induced by doxorubicin.",M2
8100506,"Hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism of salbutamol in anesthetized rabbits.Orally administered salbutamol undergoes an extensive first-pass effect. This study investigated the roles of the intestine (INT), liver (HEP), and lung (LUN) in salbutamol extraction. Salbutamol was administered to five groups of anesthetized rabbits by the following routes: intraduodenal (ID) (800 micrograms/kg), intraportal (IP), (60 micrograms/kg), intrajugular (IV) (60 micrograms/kg), endotracheal (ET) (60 micrograms/kg), and intraarterial (<e>IA</e>) (60 micrograms/kg). Multiple blood samples were drawn and the areas under salbutamol plasma concentrations-time curves (AUCs) were calculated. Since IA salbutamol administration generated 100% bioavailability (F), AUCIA was used as a reference for comparison. Salbutamol F values for the ID, IP, IV, and ET routes were 0.013, 0.15, 0.53, and 0.53, respectively. The ratio of the AUC of salbutamol administered before the organ (ID, IP, IV, or ET) to the AUC estimated when given after the organ (IP, IV, and IA) allowed assessment of the extraction ratio (E) of INT, HEP, and LUN, respectively. EINT was 0.92, EHEP was 0.71, and ELUN was 0.47. The mean ratio of the AUC of the metabolite (AUCM) over the AUC of the parent compound was 704 +/- 77 for the ID, compared with 83 +/- 12 for the IP, 11 +/- 1 for the IV, 1.7 +/- 0.3 for the ET routes, and 4 +/- 1 for the IA routes. On the other hand, when the AUCM was normalized by the dose, this ratio was INT = HEP &gt; LUN, suggesting that the ability of INT to conjugate salbutamol is not very important.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
8476088,"Arteriolar endothelium-dependent vasodilation occurs during endotoxin shock.Endotoxin shock has been reported to alter endothelial structure as well as function of large arteries from in vitro experiments. Cremaster muscle arteriolar dilator reactivity of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats was determined by videomicroscopy at control and 30, 90, 150, and 210 min after intravenous infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin (6 mg/kg, 1-h period). The dilator response was tested by intra-arterial injections of 90 ng acetylcholine (ACh). At control A1, A2, and A3 arterioles dilated 45, 21, and 34%, respectively. Postendotoxin arterial pressure decreased progressively, the A1 arterioles constricted (P &lt; 0.05), A2 diameters were unchanged and A3 diameters increased. Postendotoxin ACh dilations averaged 28, 23, and 25%. A1 dilation was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) less than at control. Methylene blue (2.5 mg <e>ia</e>) attenuated the ACh response at control, but after endotoxin an intense downstream vasoconstriction resulted in stasis and reduced survival time occurred. Hydroquinone (HQ) partially blocked the responses to ACh postendotoxin. HQ significantly increased the survival time postendotoxin. It is evident postendotoxin that the endothelia of arterioles are functional and able to release nitric oxide (NO) throughout the entire survival period. The microvascular release of NO and the dilation response to ACh were substantially attenuated by methylene blue and HQ. The latter may block the more lethal effects of the inducible NO synthase.",M2

1407919,"Transvaginal Doppler ultrasound assessment of intratumoral hemodynamic change before and during hypertensive intra-arterial chemotherapy for uterine cancer.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate blood flow in malignant uterine tumors during hypertensive intra-arterial chemotherapy. METHODS: Hypertensive intra-arterial chemotherapy (angiotensin II, cisplatin 100 mg, doxorubicin 40 mg) was given to two women with cervical cancer (stage IVA) and seven with endometrial cancer (three stage <e>IA</e>, one stage IB, two stage II, and one stage III). The intratumoral blood flow velocity waveforms were imaged by transvaginal Doppler ultrasound before and during the chemotherapy in six patients. RESULTS: The mean peak systolic velocity during hypertensive intra-arterial chemotherapy (58.9 +/- 29.3 cm/second) was significantly higher than that before chemotherapy (16.0 +/- 6.3 cm/second) (P &lt; .05). There was a significant difference between the end-diastolic velocity before (5.2 +/- 1.8 cm/second) and during chemotherapy (21.2 +/- 6.8 cm/second) (P &lt; .05). The resistance index value during hypertensive intra-arterial chemotherapy (0.607 +/- 0.094) fell significantly from that before therapy (0.644 +/- 0.119) (P &lt; .05). Blood flow velocity waveforms in normal myometrial tissue could be recorded in three cases; in all, the diastolic flow noted before hypertensive intra-arterial chemotherapy disappeared during chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that hypertensive intra-arterial chemotherapy induces a selective marked increase of blood flow in uterine cancer.",M2
1617466,"Cocaine-induced suppression of renin secretion is mediated in the brain: investigation of cardiovascular and local anesthetic mechanisms.Acute cocaine reduces renin secretion. To determine a peripheral versus central site of action, intracerebroventricular (ICV) versus intraperitoneal (IP) injections of cocaine were compared. Cocaine was more potent reducing plasma renin activity (PRA) and concentration (PRC) when injected ICV (0.050 mg/kg) than IP (5 mg/kg), suggesting a central site of action. Furthermore, addition of cocaine (10(-4) M) to kidney slices in vitro did not influence renin release, indicating that cocaine does not suppress renin secretion by acting directly in the kidney. We also investigated whether the hypertensive or local anesthetic properties of cocaine mediate its inhibition of renin secretion. Therefore, we compared the cardiovascular and endocrine effects of cocaine with those of the local anesthetic drug procaine. Both cocaine and procaine (500 micrograms/kg, ICV) produced rapid and short-term increases in blood pressure, but cocaine decreased PRC whereas procaine increased PRC. Intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) and IP injections of cocaine also reduced PRC whereas procaine had no effect (IA) or elevated PRC (IP). Together, the data suggest that cocaine decreases renin secretion by acting in the brain. It is not likely that the cardiovascular or local anesthetic actions of cocaine are the main cause of its suppressive effect on renin secretion.",M2
1448662,"Chemotherapy of malignant gliomas: studies of the BTCG.Phase III Trial 8,301 tested the efficacy and safety of intraarterial (<e>IA</e>) BCNU for the treatment of newly resected malignant glioma, comparing IA BCNU vs intravenous (IV) BCNU (200 mg/m2 q 8 wks), each regimen without or with IV 5-FU (1 g/m2/d x 3 two wks after BCNU). All patients also received radiation therapy. 505 patients entered the study; 448 were in the Valid Study Group (VSG). Excluding 190 patients who for medical reasons were not eligible for IA BCNU, 315 patients were randomized between IA (167) and IV (148) BCNU. Actuarial analysis (log-rank) demonstrated worse survival for the IA group (p = 0.002). Serious toxicity was observed in the IA group; 16 patients (9.5%) developed irreversible encephalopathy with CT evidence of cerebral edema, and 26 patients developed visual loss ipsilateral to the infused carotid artery. 5-FU did not influence survival. Survival between the IV and the IA BCNU patients with glioblastoma multiforme did not differ, but was worse for IA BCNU patients with anaplastic astrocytoma than for IV BCNU (p = 0.002). Neuropathologically, IA BCNU produced white matter necrosis. IA BCNU is neither safe nor effective. Phase II Trial 8420, compared IA cisplatin, 60 mg/m2 every 4 wks, vs IV PCNU, 100 mg/m2 q 8 wks; 311 patients were randomized. Preliminary results have been presented. Severe encephalopathy occurred in only 1.5% of patients receiving IA cisplatin. The median survival of the IV PCNU patients was 11.8 months; that of the IA cisplatin patients was 9.4 months, not statistically different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
1394808,"Intra-arterial administration of methotrexate, adriamycin, and cisplatin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for bladder cancer.As neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced bladder cancer, the intra-arterial administration of methotrexate (MTX), Adriamycin (ADM), and cisplatin (CDDP; <e>IA</e>-MAC) was evaluated. A total of 48 patients with bladder cancer (greater than or equal to T2 or CIS) were selected and received 30.1 mg MTX, 34.5 mg ADM, and 89.1 mg CDDP as an average course. The mean tumor-regression rate after 2 or 3 weeks was 52.3%, and patients with grade 3 transitional-cell carcinoma showed the best results, achieving a 69.6% regression rate. In 30 cases (63%), downstaging was observed. Among the 46 patients who underwent subsequent surgical therapy, the bladder could be preserved in 26 cases by transurethral resection or segmental resection. According to the criteria of the Japanese Association of Cancer Therapy, a histological effect of GIII or better was obtained in 15 cases (29%). The histological effect correlated well with the tumor-regression rate. As compared with intravenous therapy with MTX, vinblastine, ADM, and CDDP (M-VAC), IA-MAC treatment was well tolerated due to its lower degree of bone marrow suppression, and it resulted in a longer disease-free interval and better survival. In addition, the period prior to surgical therapy was shortened in this study. These results suggest that IA-MAC chemotherapy can be useful as an arm of multidisciplinary treatment of advanced bladder tumors.",M2
1913123,"Randomized trial of intra-arterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and intra-arterial streptokinase in peripheral arterial thrombolysis.Sixty patients were recruited into a randomized parallel group comparison of three thrombolytic regimens for acute or subacute peripheral arterial thrombosis. There were no significant differences in age, duration of history, length of occlusion or presence of neurosensory deficit between the groups. Initially successful lysis was significantly greater with intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) than with either streptokinase (Sk) (P less than 0.04) or intravenous (IV) rt-PA (P less than 0.01). The duration of therapy varied from a median of 35 h with IA rt-PA to 40 h with Sk (P greater than 0.5). The median (confidence interval) increase in ankle:brachial pressure index following IA rt-PA of 0.57 (0.33-0.82) was significantly higher than for either Sk of 0.24 (0-0.57) or for IV rt-PA of 0.18 (0-0.41). Limb salvage at 30 days was achieved in 80, 60 and 45 per cent respectively for IA rt-PA, Sk and IV rt-PA. Haemorrhagic complications occurred in six patients following Sk and in 13 following IV rt-PA; only one minor haemorrhage occurred following a catheter perforation in a patient who received IA rt-PA (P less than 0.05). IA rt-PA provides a more effective, safer fibrinolytic regimen than conventional therapy with Sk. IV rt-PA has not been as successful and carries a significantly higher risk of haemorrhagic complications.",M2
1985708,"Percent tumor necrosis as a predictor of treatment response in canine osteosarcoma.The percent tumor necrosis was determined in 200 dogs with spontaneously occurring osteosarcoma. One hundred dogs had no treatment before amputation or death. One hundred other dogs were treated with either radiation therapy alone (n = 23), intraarterial (<e>IA</e>) cisplatin alone (n = 16), intravenous (IV) cisplatin alone (n = 6), radiation therapy plus IA cisplatin (n = 47), or radiation therapy plus IV cisplatin (n = 8). Eighty-nine of these 100 dogs had their tumors resected 3 weeks after the end of therapy (6 weeks after the initiation of therapy) and replaced with a cortical bone allograft. Dogs with preoperative treatment were evaluated for local tumor control and time to metastasis. The mean percent tumor necrosis in untreated osteosarcoma was 26.8%. The mean percent tumor necrosis for dogs receiving radiation only, IA cisplatin only, and IV cisplatin only was 81.6%, 49.1% and 23.8%, respectively. The mean percent tumor necrosis for dogs receiving radiation therapy plus IA cisplatin or radiation therapy plus IV cisplatin was 83.7% and 78.2%, respectively. There was no significant difference between percent tumor necrosis in untreated osteosarcoma compared with those receiving IV cisplatin, but there was a significant increase in percent tumor necrosis with all other treatments. A mathematic model for the effect of cisplatin and radiation dose was developed using multiple regression analysis. The radiation dose calculated to cause at least 80% tumor necrosis was 42.2 Gy (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.0 to 47.6 Gy) when radiation was given alone and 28.1 Gy (95% CI, 21.3 to 36.6 Gy) when radiation was combined with IA cisplatin. Areas of viable tumor tended to be most frequent adjacent to the articular cartilage and in the joint capsule. Percent tumor necrosis was strongly predictive for local tumor control; 28 of 32 dogs with greater than 80% tumor necrosis had local control, and only eight of 29 dogs with less than 79% tumor necrosis had local control (P = 0.0047). There was no correlation between percent tumor necrosis and time to metastasis.",M2
2258579,"Inhibitory effects of centrally administered /ASU1-7/eel calcitonin on basal and stimulated prolactin release in rats.We investigated the effects of /ASU1-7/eel calcitonin (ASU1-7eelCT) on basal and stimulated prolactin (PRL) release in male rats. /ASU1-7/eelCT was administered intracerebroventricularly (icv) into freely moving rats with indwelling catheters. The administration of /ASU1-7/eelCT (2.5 micrograms/rat, icv) significantly inhibited basal PRL secretion. When PRL secretion was stimulated by exposing rats to restraint stress, /ASU1-7/eelCT (250 ng; 800 ng; 2.5 micrograms/rat, icv) dose-relatedly inhibited the PRL surges at 10 min after stress. The same doses of icv /ASU1-7/eelCT were effective in inhibiting morphine (6 mg/kg, intracarotid, <e>ia</e>-induced PRL release. No effect on stress-induced PRL secretion was observed when the peptide was administered intracarotid at the dose of 10 micrograms/rat. These results demonstrate that /ASU1-7/eelCT, as we previously observed with salmon calcitonin (sCT), has central inhibitory activity on PRL secretion, probably through enhancement of hypothalamic inhibitory pathways involved in the control of PRL.",M2
2157781,"[Evaluation of the intra-hepatic arterial injection therapy of cisplatin (CDDP)-lipiodol suspension in a child with hepatoblastoma]Treatment, beginning in November 1986, of chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) was given to a 4-year-old girl with unresectable hepatoblastoma. Laparotomy for excision was performed after 16 months of therapy. The solution of CDDP was administered by dropping intravenously (DIV therapy) or intrahepatic arterially (<e>IA</e> therapy), and a suspension of crystalline CDDP with Lipiodol containing phosphatidylcholine was injected intrahepatic arterially (CDDP-suspension therapy). To evaluate the safety and effect of CDDP-suspension therapy in this case, toxicity and antitumor effect were investigated by comparison with DIV therapy. Under chemotherapy with CDDP, logarithm of alpha-fetoprotein reduced linearly. When a slope (k) of the regression line was defined as a constant of AFP reduction rate, k was -0.0072. AFP reduction rate under CDDP-suspension therapy (k = -0.0097, 12/1987-6/1988) was more rapid than that under DIV therapy (k = -0.0053, 2/1987-12/1987), and AFP reduced completely in June of 1988. The CDDP-suspension therapy may be suggestive of more effective treatment. Platinum (Pt) concentration in serum, urine and hepatic specimens was determined in order to investigate CDDP pharmacokinetics. The area under serum concentration (AUC) per doses and renal elimination rate were lower values under CDDP-suspension therapy. In the hepatic specimen, Pt concentration was significantly higher at the site where Lipiodol was localized. These results suggested that CDDP-suspension therapy delayed CDDP distribution and reduced toxicity. After CDDP-suspension therapy, reversible toxicity to the liver was observed. However, that to kidney or to blood components was less severe than after DIV therapy. After multiple DIV therapy, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen increased gradually in the course of therapy, while they tended to recovery after multiple CDDP-suspension therapy.",M2
2584105,"Evaluation of cisplatin-induced emesis in dogs with malignant neoplasia: 115 cases (1984-1987).A retrospective review of the records of 115 dogs with 13 types of malignant tumors was performed in an attempt to identify factors that influence the degree of emesis observed within 24 hours after cisplatin therapy. Six groups were established on the basis of dosage of cisplatin and on the route of administration: 10 mg/m2 IV (n = 17), 40 mg/m2 IV (n = 10), 50 mg/m2 IV (n = 19), 60 mg/m2 IV (n = 7), 70 mg/m2 IV (n = 36), and 70 mg/m2 intra-arterially (<e>IA</e>; n = 26). Age, gender, weight, dose of cisplatin, route of administration (IV vs IA), and duration of infusion were evaluated. Increasing doses of cisplatin (P less than 0.01) and the IV route of drug administration (P less than 0.0006) were associated with an increased occurrence of vomiting in response to the first treatment. Anesthesia, performed in dogs that were given cisplatin IA, was a confounding variable that may have reduced the emetic potential of the drug after the dogs were awakened. If the dog vomited in response to the first treatment, there was a greater tendency to vomit after subsequent cisplatin treatments (P = 0.08). Multivariable analysis, after correcting for the effects of age, gender, and weight, indicated that high doses of cisplatin (P less than 0.001) and lower weight of the dog (P less than 0.04) were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of vomiting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
2624420,"Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography for suspected cerebrovascular disease--current status.Sixty-four patients with suspected atherosclerotic cervical and intracranial vascular disease were examined by intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (<e>IA</e>-DSA), following placement of a catheter in the aortic arch. The commonest abnormality demonstrated was the presence of an atherosclerotic plaque, most commonly on the posterior wall of the proximal internal carotid at its origin in the neck. The quality of the images obtained were assessed and in all patients, the carotid arteries in the neck could be adequately visualised if both oblique views of the neck were obtained. The intracranial arteries and the anterior and middle cerebral arteries were also adequately visualised in all patients although the basilar-posterior cerebral arteries were poorly seen in 8%. DSA examinations of the carotid and intracerebral vessels can also be performed by the intravenous route (IV-DSA). However IV-DSA is associated with significant limitations which include inadequate visualisation of intracranial circulation, larger volume of contrast medium required and higher risk of contrast reactions. IA-DSA gives adequate visualisation of the aortic arch, cervical vessels and intracranial circulation in most patients without selective catheterisation. Examination time is shorter, procedure is safe and film costs are reduced. Disadvantages include small field size and inferior spatial resolution compared to conventional angiography but in no patients was there a need to resort to conventional angiography.",M2

The reduction curve of intra-arterial administration closely resembles to that of intra-portal administration. Maximum blood level and AUC of intracavitary administration were relatively low compared with those of administration into blood vessels. Bone marrow suppression was seen in patients given mitomycin C into blood vessels and wound healing disturbance such as anastomotic leakage were noted in patients by intra-cavitary administration.",M2
2547032,"Intra-arterial cisplatin for the treatment of malignant gliomas.Cisplatin (DDP) is a chemotherapeutic agent that has shown efficacy against primary CNS malignancies. Intra-arterial (<e>IA</e>) administration of DDP to patients with brain tumors should produce higher peak levels of drug than intravenous (IV) administration of an identical dose and reduce systemic toxicity. Twelve patients with malignant glioma were entered into the study. All had failed irradiation, 11 had failed IA BCNU. Each patient received IA DDP, 58-100 mg/m2, into the internal carotid artery at four to six week intervals. One of 12 patients had a partial response of 6 months. The remaining 11 patients had progressive disease or severe complications. Toxicity included seizures in four patients, weakness and/or aphasia in four patients, coma in two patients, and visual deterioration in two patients. IA DDP has very limited efficacy in patients with malignant gliomas after failure of nitrosoureas and is associated with an unacceptable level of toxicity. IA DDP may be more effective when used as initial chemotherapy of malignant gliomas.",M2
2910779,"Comparative study of intravenous and intraarterial cis-platinum on intratumoral platinum concentration in carcinoma of the cervix.In order to define the influence of intraarterial administration of cis-platinum in tumors of the cervix, a preliminary crossover study was performed to measure and compare the intratumoral concentrations (ITC) of platinum obtained respectively after intravenous (iv) and intraarterial (<e>ia</e>) (both bilateral hypogastric arteries) injection. The results in nine patients demonstrate that higher (P = 0.05) intratumoral concentrations are obtained after intraarterial injection of cis-platinum: 10; 3.7-23.7 ng Pt/mg of dry tissue after ia (median; range) 6.9; 4.1-23.6 ng Pt/mg tissue after iv. This difference is probably too small to be of clinical significance and a comparative clinical trial does not seem to be warranted. The results also show a large intersubject variation in intratumoral platinum concentration which are reproducible in patients whatever route of administration is used. Thus the observed differences in ITC are more related to the variability of the tumor properties than to the route of administration.",M2
