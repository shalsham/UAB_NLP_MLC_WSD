20066549,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type 1 (PAC1) receptor is expressed during embryonic development of the earthworm.Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP)-like molecules have been shown to be present in cocoon albumin and in Eisenia fetida embryos at an early developmental stage (E1) by immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay. Here, we focus on detecting the stage at which PAC1 receptor (PAC1R)-like immunoreactivity first appears in germinal layers and structures, e.g., various parts of the central nervous system (CNS), in developing earthworm embryos. PAC1R-like immunoreactivity was revealed by Western blot and Far Western blot as early as the E2 developmental stage, occurring in the ectoderm and later in specific neurons of the developing CNS. Labeled CNS neurons were first seen in the supraesophageal <e>ganglion</e> (brain) and subsequently in the subesophageal and ventral nerve cord ganglia. Ultrastructurally, PAC1Rs were located mainly on plasma membranes and intracellular membranes, especially on cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, PACAP-like compounds probably influence the differentiation of germinal layers (at least the ectoderm) and of some neurons and might act as signaling molecules during earthworm embryonic development.",M1
20014097,"The formation of the superior and jugular ganglia: insights into the generation of sensory neurons by the neural crest.The superior and jugular ganglia (S/JG) are the proximal ganglia of the IXth and Xth cranial nerves and the sensory neurons of these ganglia are neural crest derived. However, it has been unclear the extent to which their differentiation resembles that of the Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRGs). In the DRGs, neural crest cells undergo neuronal differentiation just after the onset of migration and there is evidence suggesting that these cells are pre-specified towards a sensory fate. We have analysed sensory neuronal differentiation in the S/JG. We show, in keeping with previous studies, that neuronal differentiation initiates long after the cessation of neural crest migration. We also find no evidence for the existence of migratory neural crest cells pre-specified towards a sensory phenotype prior to <e>ganglion</e> formation. Rather our results suggest that sensory neuronal differentiation in the S/JG is the result of localised spatiotemporal cues.",M1
20010445,"Evidence of a gustatory-vestibular pathway for protein transport.OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate anatomically a pathway for protein transport from the palate to the vestibular system. METHOD: The vestibulofacial anastomosis and associated <e>ganglion</e> cells were identified in a collection of 160 horizontally sectioned human temporal bones that had been stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was applied to the greater superficial petrosal nerve in 4 Sprague-Dawley rats. After 30 hours, the rats were killed by intracardiac perfusion, and the seventh and eighth nerves with adjacent brainstem removed. Frozen sections cut at 30 mum through this block were then reacted for HRP, counterstained with neutral red, and mounted on slides for examination in the light microscope. RESULTS: Thirty-two of the 160 human temporal bones contained sections through the vestibulofacial anastomosis and its ganglion. In all cases, the ganglion was incorporated into the vestibular ganglion (VG) adjacent to the nervus intermedius. In all 4 experimental rats, HRP reaction product labeled a small number of ganglion cells in the VG adjacent to the nervus intermedius and facial nerve. CONCLUSION: These observations support the presence of a pathway from receptors in the palate to the VG.",M1
19936227,"Disorganized innervation and neuronal loss in the inner ear of Slitrk6-deficient mice.Slitrks are type I transmembrane proteins that share conserved leucine-rich repeat domains similar to those in the secreted axonal guidance molecule Slit. They also show similarities to Ntrk neurotrophin receptors in their carboxy-termini, sharing a conserved tyrosine residue. Among 6 Slitrk family genes in mammals, Slitrk6 has a unique expression pattern, with strong expression in the sensory epithelia of the inner ear. We generated Slitrk6-knockout mice and investigated the development of their auditory and vestibular sensory organs. Slitrk6-deficient mice showed pronounced reduction in the cochlear innervation. In the vestibule, the innervation to the posterior crista was often lost, reduced, or sometimes misguided. These defects were accompanied by the loss of neurons in the spiral and vestibular ganglia. Cochlear sensory epithelia from Slitrk6-knockout mice have reduced ability in promoting neurite outgrowth of spiral <e>ganglion</e> neurons. Indeed the Slitrk6-deficient inner ear showed a mild but significant decrease in the expression of Bdnf and Ntf3, both of which are essential for the innervation and survival of sensory neurons. In addition, the expression of Ntrk receptors, including their phosphorylated forms was decreased in Slitrk6-knockout cochlea. These results suggest that Slitrk6 promotes innervation and survival of inner ear sensory neurons by regulating the expression of trophic and/or tropic factors including neurotrophins from sensory epithelia.",M1
19896979,"Neuronal elasticity as measured by atomic force microscopy.A cell's form and function is determined to a great extent by its cellular membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton. Understanding changes in the cellular membrane and cytoskeleton can provide insight into aging and disease of the cell. The atomic force microscope (AFM) allows unparalled resolution for the imaging of these cellular components and the ability to probe their mechanical properties. This report describes our progress toward the use of AFM as a tool in neuroscience applications. Elasticity measurements are reported on living chick embryo dorsal root <e>ganglion</e> and sympathetic neurons in vitro. The neuronal cellular body and growth cones regions are examined for variations in cellular maturity. In addition, cellular changes due to exposure to various environmental conditions and neurotoxins are investigated. This report includes data obtained on different AFM systems, using various AFM techniques and thus also provides knowledge of AFM instruments and methodology.",M1
19864207,"Neurotensin receptor 1 immunoreactivity in the peripheral ganglia and carotid body.In the present study we investigated, through immunohistochemistry, the presence and location of neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) in the peripheral ganglia and carotid body of 16 humans and 5 rats. In both humans and rats, NTR1 immunostained <e>ganglion</e> cells were found in superior cervical ganglia (57.4+/-11.6% and 72.4+/-11.4%, respectively, p0.05), enteric ganglia (51.9+/-10.4% and 64.6+/-6.1, p&lt;0.05), sensory ganglia (69.2+/-10.7% and 73.0+/-13.1%, p&gt;0.05) and parasympathetic ganglia (52.1+/-14.1% and 59.4+/-14.0%, p&gt;0.05), supporting a modulatory role for NT in these ganglia. Positivity was also detected in 45.6+/-9.2% and 50.8+/-6.8% of human and rat type I glomic cells, respectively, whereas type II cells were negative. Our findings suggest that NT produced by type I cells acts in an autocrine or paracrine way on the same cell type, playing a modulatory role on chemoception.",M1
19780868,"Nerve injury-related erectile dysfunction following nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: a novel experimental dissection model.OBJECTIVES: To establish a new experimental rat model in order to define the mechanisms of erectile dysfunction (ED) and to evaluate the changes of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the pelvic ganglia following nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to sham operation, bilateral cavernous nerve dissection (BCND) and bilateral cavernous nerve resection (BCNR) groups. In the BCND group, the cavernous nerves were only dissected bilaterally from the major pelvic <e>ganglion</e> (MPG) to the apex of the prostate without crushing or cutting. At 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after surgery, we examined intracavernous pressure along with arterial pressure (ICP/AP), retrograde dye tracing using Fluorogold (FG) and expression of nNOS in the MPG. RESULTS: Intracavernous pressure and arterial pressure in the BCND group was significantly decreased at 2 and 4 weeks after surgery compared with the sham group, and improved at 8 weeks. The number of FG-positive cells in the MPG also recovered at 8 weeks. ICP/AP and FG-positive cells in the BCNR group were greatly decreased until 8 weeks. The percentage of nNOS-positive cells per total cells was not different between the sham and BCND groups during the experimental period, whereas that in the BCNR group gradually decreased with time. CONCLUSIONS: We established a novel rat model, in which cavernous nerve dissection alone caused nerve injury-related ED. We believe that this cavernous nerve dissection model might help clarify the mechanism of nerve injury-related ED and the recovery from ED after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.",M1
19703967,"Multifunctional rapidly adapting mechanosensitive enteric neurons (RAMEN) in the myenteric plexus of the guinea pig ileum.An important feature of the enteric nervous system (ENS) is its capability to respond to mechanical stimulation which, as currently suggested for the guinea-pig ileum, is encoded by specialized intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs). We used von Frey hairs or intraganglionic volume injections to mimic <e>ganglion</e> deformation as observed in freely contracting preparations. Using fast voltage-sensitive dye imaging we identified rapidly adapting mechanosensitive enteric neurons (RAMEN, 25% of all neurons) in the myenteric plexus of the guinea pig ileum. RAMEN responded with phasic spike discharge to dynamic changes during ganglion deformation. This response was reproducible and increased with increasing forces. Deformation-evoked spike discharge was not changed by synaptic blockade with hexamethonium, omega-conotoxin or low Ca(2+)/high Mg(2+), defunctionalization of extrinsic afferents with capsaicin or muscle paralysis with nifedipine, suggesting direct activation of RAMEN. All RAMEN received hexamethonium-sensitive fast EPSPs, which were blocked by omega-conotoxin and low Ca(2+)/high Mg(2+). Seventy-two per cent of RAMEN were cholinergic, 22% nitrergic, and 44% were calbindin and NeuN negative, markers used to identify IPANs. Mechanosensitivity was observed in 31% and 47% of retrogradely traced interneurons and motor neurons, respectively. RAMEN belong to a new population of mechanosensitive neurons which differ from IPANs. We provided evidence for multifunctionality of RAMEN which may fulfil sensory, integrative and motor functions. In light of previously identified mechanosensitive neuron populations, mechanosensitivity appears to be a property of many more enteric neurons than generally assumed. The findings call for a revision of current concepts on sensory transmission within the ENS.",M1
19670860,"Observation of cellular cholesterol efflux at microcavity electrodes.Cholesterol oxidase modified platinum microcavity electrodes are used to measure cholesterol efflux from the plasma membrane surface of a single neuron in the buccal <e>ganglion</e> of Aplysia at room temperature. A background subtraction analog chronocoulometry method is used to measure hydrogen peroxide accumulation in the microcavity volume resulting from cellular cholesterol efflux and enzymatic oxidation. The data are consistent with the aqueous diffusion model for cellular cholesterol efflux where plasma membrane cholesterol undergoes exchange with solution phase cholesterol.",M1
19553444,"Neuroligin 2 controls the maturation of GABAergic synapses and information processing in the retina.In the present study, we investigated the role of Neuroligin 2 (NL2) in synaptic transmission and network function using the mouse retina as a model circuit. We show that NL2 is preferentially located at GABAergic rather than glycinergic or glutamatergic postsynapses. The absence of NL2 from the retina resulted in a severe reduction of GABA(A) receptor clustering, and in subtle alterations of the retinal circuitry. Light processing was impaired accordingly, and retinal <e>ganglion</e> cells, the output neurons of the retina, showed increased basal activity and altered coding of visual information. Together, our data indicate that NL2 is essential for the functional integrity of GABAergic signaling and as a consequence, for information processing in the retina.",M1
19540422,"Novel gene encoding precursor protein consisting of possible several neuropeptides expressed in brain and frontal <e>ganglion</e> of the silkworm, Bombyx mori.A novel gene (BmK5) expressed in the central nervous system of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, was isolated using a cDNA subtraction method. BmK5 was first cloned as a candidate regulator of diapause hormone release from subesophageal ganglion via corpus cardiacum-corpus allatum into the hemolymph; however, subsequent analyses revealed that the gene expression patterns in brain-subesophageal ganglion complexes did not differ between diapause and nondiapause egg producers. The deduced amino acid sequence showed the characteristics of secretory protein precursor or nuclear localization protein. Immunohistochemical experiments with an anti-BmK5 antibody revealed that BmK5 precursor protein exists in the cytoplasm of specific cells of brain and frontal ganglion, but not in the nuclei. In addition, a peptide (GSGTKVGGAGAATKVVTKSGS-NH(2)) possibly processed from the BmK5 precursor protein was immunohistochemically detected in the axons connecting the anti-BmK5 antibody-positive cells to the neurohemal organ, corpus cardiacum-corpus allatum. These results suggest that BmK5 encodes a precursor of the novel neurosecretory protein and that several mature peptides are released into the hemolymph via the corpus cardiacum-corpus allatum, although the functions of these peptides are yet unclear.",M1
19540264,"One-to-one neuron-electrode interfacing.The question of neuronal network development and organization is a principle one, which is closely related to aspects of neuronal and network form-function interactions. In-vitro two-dimensional neuronal cultures have proved to be an attractive and successful model for the study of these questions. Research is constraint however by the search for techniques aimed at culturing stable networks, whose electrical activity can be reliably and consistently monitored. A simple approach to form small interconnected neuronal circuits while achieving one-to-one neuron-electrode interfacing is presented. Locust neurons were cultured on a novel bio-chip consisting of carbon-nanotube multi-electrode-arrays. The cells self-organized to position themselves in close proximity to the bio-chip electrodes. The organization of the cells on the electrodes was analyzed using time lapse microscopy, fluorescence imaging and scanning electron microscopy. Electrical recordings from well identified cells is presented and discussed. The unique properties of the bio-chip and the specific neuron-nanotube interactions, together with the use of relatively large insect <e>ganglion</e> cells, allowed long-term stabilization (as long as 10 days) of predefined neural network topology as well as high fidelity electrical recording of individual neuron firing. This novel preparation opens ample opportunity for future investigation into key neurobiological questions and principles.",M1
19505516,"Mass spectrometric characterization and physiological actions of novel crustacean C-type allatostatins.The crustacean stomatogastric <e>ganglion</e> (STG) is modulated by numerous neuropeptides that are released locally in the neuropil or that reach the STG as neurohormones. Using 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (DAN) as a reductive screening matrix for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometric profiling of disulfide bond-containing C-type allatostatin peptides followed by electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF) tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis, we identified and sequenced a novel C-type allatostatin peptide (CbAST-C1), pQIRYHQCYFNPISCF-COOH, present in the pericardial organs of the crab, Cancer borealis. Another C-type allatostatin (CbAST-C2), SYWKQCAFNAVSCFamide, was discovered using the expressed sequence tag (EST) database search strategy in both C. borealis and the lobster, Homarus americanus, and further confirmed with de novo sequencing using ESI-Q-TOF tandem MS. Electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that both CbAST-C1 and CbAST-C2 inhibited the frequency of the pyloric rhythm of the STG, in a state-dependent manner. At 10(-6)M, both peptides were only modestly effective when initial frequencies of the pyloric rhythm were &gt;0.8Hz, but almost completely suppressed the pyloric rhythm when applied to preparations with starting frequencies &lt;0.7Hz. Surprisingly, these state-dependent actions are similar to those of the structurally unrelated allatostatin A and allatostatin B families of peptides.",M1
19423308,"Descending unpaired median neurons with bilaterally symmetrical axons in the suboesophageal <e>ganglion</e> of Manduca sexta larvae.Three large median cell bodies with a diameter between 40 and 70 microm that exhibit octopamine immunoreactivity were identified in the posterior part of the suboesophageal ganglion of the tobacco hawkmoth larva, Manduca sexta. These neurons possess bilaterally symmetrical axons in the posterior neck connectives, and at least one of them extends through the whole ventral nerve cord to the terminal abdominal ganglion. Therefore, these neurons belong to the class of descending ventral unpaired median neurons. From each cell body, a primary neurite ascends anteriorly, which after bending dorsally turns posteriorly and then bifurcates to give rise to two descending axons. From the primary neurite two main dendritic branches ascend anteriorly, and four characteristic branches can be distinguished originating from them: two descending dendritic branches and two ascending dendritic branches. Dense arborizations from all these branches exist in all neuromeres of the suboesophageal ganglion. Intracellular recordings from these neurons show that in contrast to the ventral unpaired median neurons of thoracic and abdominal ganglia, they do not produce overshooting action potentials but exhibit passive soma spikes only. During pharmacologically evoked fictive motor patterns these neurons show coupling to various motor patterns such as crawling, feeding and molting.",M1
19419933,"Expression of ghrelin in human fetal adrenal glands and paraadrenal nerve <e>ganglions</e>.The aim of this paper was assessment of location, expression and role of ghrelin in the development and maturation of human fetal adrenal glands and paraadrenal nerve ganglions. Immunohistochemistry was used. The strongest expression of ghrelin was detected in the fetal zone of the adrenal glands, in the neuroepithelial cells of the medullar portion of the adrenals and in few nerve ganglion cells. Ghrelin takes part in molecular processes of proliferation and maturation, and does not influence on steroidogenesis.",M1
19322590,"Quantitative evaluation of myenteric <e>ganglion</e> cells in normal human left colon: implications for histopathological analysis.The analysis of myenteric neurons is becoming increasingly important for the assessment of enteric nervous system injury and degeneration occurring in motor disorders of the gut. Limited information is presently available on the quantitative estimation of myenteric neurons and glial cells in paraffin-embedded colonic sections; additional data would be useful for diagnostic purposes. In this morphometric study, we performed immunohistochemistry to count myenteric neurons and glial cells in paraffin sections of human colon. Serial cross sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded full-thickness normal human left colon (n = 10, age-range: 50-72 years) were examined. HuC/D and S100beta antigens were found to be the best markers for the detection of neurons and glial cells, respectively. Significant correlations were noted between the numbers of neurons/glial cells and the respective myenteric ganglion areas. These findings suggest that HuC/D-S100beta-immunostained paraffin cross sections of human colon can be regarded as valuable tools for the quantitative estimation of myenteric neurons and glial cells. Based on the present method, only a limited number of paraffin sections are needed for reliable quantitative assessments of myenteric ganglion cells, thus allowing fast and simple approaches in the settings of the histopathological diagnosis of colonic motility disorders and retrospective evaluations of pathological archival tissue specimens.",M1
19080481,"[Protection of autoimmunity induced by copolymer-1 on optic nerve: experiment with rat glaucoma models]OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether copolymer-1 (Cop-1), a synthesized analogue of myelin basic protein, can protect the retina <e>ganglion</e> cells (RGCs) and possible mechanism thereof. METHODS: Vortex veins of rats were ligated to induce an increase of intraocular pressure (IOP) so as to establish glaucoma models. 106 rat models were randomly divided into 2 equal groups: Cop-1 Group undergoing subcutaneous injection of 200 microg Cop-1, and phosphate buffered solution (PBS) Group undergoing PBS injection as controls. Fluorogold was used to retrogradely label the RGCs. 10, 17, 24, and 31 days after the immunization some rats were killed with their eyeballs taken out. The fluorogold positive spots were calculated. Anti-rat T cell receptor (TCR) monoclonal antibody was used to mark T cells in the retina. RESULTS: 17, 24, and 31 days after the immunization, the RGC density of the Cop-1 Group were (2617 +/- 17)/mm(2), (2588 +/- 206)/mm(2), and (2394 +/- 15)/mm(2) respectively, all significantly higher than those of the PBS Group [(2357 +/- 37)/mm(2), (2277 +/- 340)/mm(2), and (2129 +/- 17)/mm(2) respectively, all P &lt; 0.05]. 10, 17, 24, and 31 days after the immunization the numbers of T cells in the retina of Cop-1 Group were (11.3 +/- 2.8)/mm(2), (36.7 +/- 5.2)/mm(2), (33.9 +/- 3.0)/mm(2), and (21.4 +/- 5.9)/mm(2), all significantly higher than those of PBS Group (4.7 +/- 3.6)/mm(2), (19.7 +/- 2.4)/mm(2), (15.3 +/- 4.0)/mm(2), and (13.3 +/- 4.4)/mm(2) respectively, all P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: Cop-1 protects RGCs. The injury of RGCs induced by increased IOP results in congregation of T cells. Cop-1 increases the number of T-lymphocyte cells congregating in the retina, which may be related to its neuroprotection.",M1
19073190,"Corazonin- and PDF-immunoreactivities in the cephalic ganglia of termites.Antisera against the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) and corazonin (Crz) reacted with distinct sets of neurons in the cephalic ganglia of termites. The locations of immunoreactive cells were similar but their numbers differed among the eight species examined: PDF-ir occurred in 0-6 cells in each optic lobe and 1-2 pairs of cells in the subosophageal <e>ganglion</e> (SOG), and Crz-ir in 0-2 pairs of cells in the pars intecerebralis, 3-14 cells in each lateral protocerebrum, and 0-6 pairs of cells in the SOG. Staining patterns were identical in the pseudergates, soldiers, and substitutive reproductives of Prorhinotermes simplex. Workers and soldiers were compared in the remaining 7 species. The only caste divergence was detected in Coptotermes formosanus, in which the soldiers differed from the workers by lack of 4 Crz-ir perikarya in the pars intercerebralis and occasionally also by the absence of 2 Crz-ir perikarya in the SOG. Diurnal changes in PDF-ir and Crz-ir were examined in P. simplex kept under long day (18:6h light:darkness) or short day (10:14 h) photoperiods. No circadian fluctuations in the distribution or the intensity of immunostaining were found in the pseudergates and soldiers that were sacrificed in 4h intervals or in the male and female substitutive reproductives examined in 6h intervals.",M1
19031082,"Development of nervous systems to metamorphosis in feeding and non-feeding echinoid larvae, the transition from bilateral to radial symmetry.The development of nervous system (NS) in the non-feeding vestibula larva of the sea urchin, Holopneustes purpurescens, and the feeding echinopluteus larva of Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus was examined by focusing on fate during metamorphosis. In H. purpurescens, the serotonergic NS (SerNS) appeared simultaneously and independently in larval tissue and adult rudiment, respectively, from 3-day post-fertilization. In 4-day vestibulae, an expansive aboral <e>ganglion</e> (450 x 100 mum) was present in the larval mid region that extended axons toward the oral ectoderm. These axons diverged near the base of the primary podia. An axonal bundle connected with the primary podia and the rim of vestopore on the oral side. Thus, the SerNS of the larva innervated the rudiment at early stage of development of the primary podia. This innervation was short-lived, and immediately before metamorphosis, it disappeared from the larval and adult tissue domains, whereas non-SerNS marked by synaptotagmin remained. The NS of 1-month post-fertilization plutei of H. pulcherrimus comprised an apical ganglion (50 x 17 mum) and axons that extended to the ciliary bands and the adult rudiment (AR). A major basal nerve of serotonergic and non-serotonergic axons and a minor non-serotonergic nerve comprised the ciliary band nerve. In 3-month plutei, axonal connection among the primary podia in the neural folds completed. The SerNS never developed in the AR. Thus, there was distinctive difference between feeding- and non-feeding larvae of the above sea urchins with respect to SerNS and the AR.",M1
18978036,"The action of high K+ and aglycaemia on the electrical properties and synaptic transmission in rat intracardiac <e>ganglion</e> neurones in vitro.We have investigated the action of two elements of acute ischaemia, high potassium and aglycaemia, on the electrophysiological properties and ganglionic transmission of adult rat intracardiac ganglion (ICG) neurones. We used a whole-mount ganglion preparation of the right atrial ganglion plexus and sharp microelectrode recording techniques. Increasing extracellular K(+) from its normal value of 4.7 mm to 10 mm decreased membrane potential and action potential after-hyperpolarization amplitude but otherwise had no effect on postganglionic membrane properties. It did, however, reduce the ability of synaptically evoked action potentials to follow high-frequency (100 Hz) repetitive stimulation. A further increase in K(+) changed both the passive and the active membrane properties of the postganglionic neurone: time constant, membrane resistance and action potential overshoot were all decreased in high K(+) (20 mm). The ICG neurones display a predominantly phasic discharge in response to prolonged depolarizing current pulses. High K(+) had no impact on this behaviour but reduced the time-dependent rectification response to hyperpolarizing currents. At 20 mm, K(+) practically blocked ganglionic transmission in most neurones at all frequencies tested. Aglycaemia, nominally glucose-free physiological saline solution (PSS), increased the time constant and membrane resistance of ICG neurones but otherwise had no action on their passive or active properties or ganglionic transmission. However, the combination of aglycaemia and 20 mm K(+) displayed an improvement in passive properties and ganglionic transmission when compared with 20 mm K(+) PSS. These data indicate that the presynaptic terminal is the primary target of high extracellular potassium and that aglycaemia may have protective actions against this challenge.",M1
18830617,"Expression of cGMP signaling elements in the Grueneberg <e>ganglion</e>.The Grueneberg ganglion (GG) is a cluster of neurons localized to the vestibule of the anterior nasal cavity. Based on axonal projections to the olfactory bulb of the brain, as well as expression of olfactory receptors and the olfactory marker protein, it is considered a chemosensory subsystem. Recently, it was observed that in mice, GG neurons respond to cool ambient temperatures. In mammals, coolness-induced responses in highly specialized neuronal cells are supposed to rely on the ion channel TRPM8, whereas in thermosensory neurons of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, detection of environmental temperature is mainly mediated by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathways, in which cGMP is generated by transmembrane guanylyl cyclases. To unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying coolness-induced responses in GG neurons, potential expression of TRPM8 in the murine GG was investigated; however, no evidence was found that this ion channel is present in the GG. By contrast, a substantial number of GG neurons was observed to express the transmembrane guanylyl cyclase subtype GC-G. In the nose, GC-G expression appears to be confined to the GG since it was not detectable in other nasal compartments. In the GG, coolness-stimulated responses are only observed in neurons characterized by the expression of the olfactory receptor V2r83. Interestingly, expression of GC-G in the GG was found in this V2r83-positive subpopulation but not in other GG neurons. In addition to GC-G, V2r83-positive GG cells also co-express the phosphodiesterase PDE2A. Thus, in summary, coolness-sensitive V2r83-expressing GG neurons are endowed with a cGMP cascade which might underlie thermosensitivity of these cells, similar to the cGMP pathway mediating thermosensation in neurons of C. elegans.",M1
18824120,"Effects of selected neuropeptides, mating status and castration on male reproductive tract movements and immunolocalization of neuropeptides in earwigs.In earwigs, the male reproductive system is complex, comprising accessory glands and long dual intromittent organs for transfer of materials to the female and for removal of rival sperm. We investigated potential factors altering contractions of the male reproductive tracts in vitro. Tracts from 0-day (newly emerged) males displayed relatively little motility in vitro; however, those from 5-day (intermediate stage of sexual maturity) and 8-day (fully mature) males pulsed vigorously. Both 1 and 100 nM proctolin (RYLPT-OH) stimulated the rate of contraction of reproductive tracts from both 5-day and 8-day males. In contrast, 1 nM and 100 nM FGLa AST (cockroach allatostatin) did not affect pulsations. However, 10 microM FGLa AST decreased activity of reproductive tracts. Mating decreased motility of tracts from 5-day old males, but did not alter motility of tracts from 8-day old males. Castration of larvae significantly suppressed reproductive tract motility in subsequent 8-day old adults compared with those of intact or sham-operated adults. Castration also suppressed seminal vesicle size. Lastly, we assessed the presence and distribution of proctolin-like and allatostatin-like immunoreactivity in tissues. Immunoreactivity to FGLa AST and proctolin was widespread, occurring in the brain and ventral ganglia. Surprisingly, we did not detect immunoreactivity to either FGLa AST or proctolin within the reproductive system; however, proctolin immunoreactivity was evident in nerves extending from the terminal <e>ganglion</e> of 8-day, but not 0-day, males. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that the male earwig reproductive system is an appropriate model for use in addressing sexual maturation and activities in male insects.",M1
18814235,"Promoting neurite outgrowth from spiral <e>ganglion</e> neuron explants using polypyrrole/BDNF-coated electrodes.Release of neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from hair cells in the cochlea is essential for the survival of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Loss of hair cells associated with a sensorineural hearing loss therefore results in degeneration of SGNs, potentially reducing the performance of a cochlear implant. Exogenous replacement of either or both neurotrophins protects SGNs from degeneration after deafness. We previously incorporated NT3 into the conducting polymer polypyrrole (Ppy) synthesized with para-toluene sulfonate (pTS) to investigate whether Ppy/pTS/NT3-coated cochlear implant electrodes could provide both neurotrophic support and electrical stimulation for SGNs. Enhanced and controlled release of NT3 was achieved when Ppy/pTS/NT3-coated electrodes were subjected to electrical stimulation. Here we describe the release dynamics and biological properties of Ppy/pTS with incorporated BDNF. Release studies demonstrated slow passive diffusion of BDNF from Ppy/pTS/BDNF, with electrical stimulation significantly enhancing BDNF release over 7 days. A 3-day SGN explant assay found that neurite outgrowth from explants was 12.3-fold greater when polymers contained BDNF (p &lt; 0.001), although electrical stimulation did not increase neurite outgrowth further. The versatility of Ppy to store and release neurotrophins, conduct electrical charge, and act as a substrate for nerve-electrode interactions is discussed for specialized applications such as cochlear implants.",M1
18777570,"The terminal abdominal <e>ganglion</e> of the wood cricket Nemobius sylvestris.The abdominal cerci of the wood cricket, Nemobius sylvestris, are covered by a variety of hair-like sensilla that differ in length, thickness, and articulation. Fillings from the cercal nerves with cobalt chloride and fluorescent dyes revealed the projection of sensory axons into the terminal abdominal ganglion of the ventral nerve chain. Two projection areas on each side of the terminal abdominal ganglion midline could be identified: a posterior cercal glomerulus and an anterior bristle neuropil. Axons from some cercal sensilla ascend through the connectives to reach the metathoracic ganglionic mass. As their axons pass through each segmental abdominal ganglion, they project medial arborization. Cross-sections of the terminal abdominal ganglion and retrograde fills with cobalt chloride and fluorescent dyes from connectives revealed several small cells and seven pairs of giant ascending interneurons organized symmetrically. Giant somata are located contralateral to their axons (diameters between 20 and 45 mum). The cercal projections overlap extensively with the dendritic fields of the giant interneurons. In the terminal abdominal ganglion, we identified nine longitudinal tracts, two major tracts, and seven smaller ones. The functional implications of the neuranatomical organization of the system are discussed on a comparative basis.",M1
18714126,"Selective extracellular stimulation of individual neurons in ganglia.Selective control of individual neurons could clarify neural functions and aid disease treatments. To target specific neurons, it may be useful to focus on ganglionic neuron clusters, which are found in the peripheral nervous system in vertebrates. Because neuron cell bodies are found primarily near the surface of invertebrate ganglia, and often found near the surface of vertebrate ganglia, we developed a technique for controlling individual neurons extracellularly using the buccal ganglia of the marine mollusc Aplysia californica as a model system. We experimentally demonstrated that anodic currents can selectively activate an individual neuron and cathodic currents can selectively inhibit an individual neuron using this technique. To define spatial specificity, we studied the minimum currents required for stimulation, and to define temporal specificity, we controlled firing frequencies up to 45 Hz. To understand the mechanisms of spatial and temporal specificity, we created models using the NEURON software package. To broadly predict the spatial specificity of arbitrary neurons in any <e>ganglion</e> sharing similar geometry, we created a steady-state analytical model. A NEURON model based on cat spinal motor neurons showed responses to extracellular stimulation qualitatively similar to those of the Aplysia NEURON model, suggesting that this technique could be widely applicable to vertebrate and human peripheral ganglia having similar geometry.",M1
18632889,"Low-voltage-activated potassium channels underlie the regulation of intrinsic firing properties of rat vestibular <e>ganglion</e> cells.Individual primary vestibular afferents exhibit spontaneous activity the regularity of which can vary from regular to irregular. Different aspects of vestibular responsiveness have been associated with this dimension of regularity of resting discharge. Isolated rat vestibular ganglion cells (VGCs) showed heterogeneous intrinsic firing properties during sustained membrane depolarization: some neurons exhibited a strong adaptation generating just a single or a few spikes (phasic type), whereas other neurons showed moderate adaptation or tonic firing (tonic type). Tonic discharging VGCs were rare at postnatal days 5-7 and increased up to approximately 60% of neurons during postnatal 2-3 wk. To explore the major factors responsible for the discharge regularity of primary vestibular afferents, we investigated the contribution of K+ channels to the firing properties of isolated rat VGCs. Phasic firing became tonic firing in the presence of 4-aminopyridine or alpha-dendrotoxin, indicating that Kv1 potassium channels control the firing pattern of the phasic VGCs. Tetraethylammonium decreased the number of spikes during step current stimuli in all types. Blockade of Ca2+-activated K+ channels decreased the number of spikes in tonic VGCs. Our results suggest that Kv1 channels are critical both in determining the pattern of spike discharge in rat vestibular ganglion neurons and in their proportional change during maturation.",M1
18618296,"Correlation of enteric NADPH-d positive cell counts with the duration of incubation period in NADPH-d histochemistry.Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) staining can be used in the enteric nervous system to determine nitrergic neuronal counts, critical in motility disorders such as intestinal neuronal dysplasia and hypoganglionosis. The reported incubation periods of specimens with NADPH-d staining solution has varied from 2 to 24 h. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the incubation period on the overall NADPH-d positive cell counts in porcine rectal submucosal plexus. The submucosal plexus of rectal specimens from 12-week-old pigs (n = 5) were studied. Conventional frozen sections were used to identify nitrergic neurons while whole-mount preparations were used to quantify the effect of prolonged duration of incubation on positively identified <e>ganglion</e> cells with NADPH-d histochemistry. The same submucosal ganglia on the conventional sections, and a minimum of 12 ganglia per whole-mount preparation specimen were photographed sequentially at 2, 6, and 24 h and used to count the number of nitrergic cells per ganglion. The same staining solution was used throughout the experiment. Results were analysed using a one-way ANOVA test. Prolonged incubation with the staining solution revealed new NADPH-d positive cells in the ganglia on the conventional sections. The total number of neurons counted in the 12 adjacent ganglia in the whole-mount specimens was 180 +/- 55, the mean neuronal cell per ganglion was 15 +/- 8 after 2 h of incubation. This increased to 357 +/- 17, and to 29 +/- 12 after 6 h (p &lt; 0.05). A further increase was observed of 515 +/- 19 and 43 +/- 17 after 24 h (p &lt; 0.05). When the photomicrographs were retrospectively analysed, not even the outline of the neuronal cells that stained with prolonged incubation was evident at the earlier time points. NADPH-d positive cell counts increase in proportion to the duration of incubation in NADPH-d histochemistry. Comparative studies attempting to quantify nitrergic cell counts in dysmotility disorders must take into account the variability in NADPH-d positive cell count associated with prolonged incubation in NADPH-d histochemistry.",M1
18457135,"Synaptic dimorphism in Onychophoran cephalic ganglia.The taxonomic location of the Onychophora has been controversial because of their phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, related to both annelids and arthropods. We analyzed the ultrastructure of the neurons and their synapses in the cephalic <e>ganglion</e> of a poorly known invertebrate, the velvet worm Peripatus sedgwicki, from the mountainous region of El Valle, Mérida, Venezuela. Cephalic ganglia were dissected, fixed and processed for transmission electron microscopy. The animal has a high degree of neurobiological development, as evidenced by the presence of asymmetric (excitatory) and symmetric (inhibitory) synapses, as well as the existence of glial cell processes in a wide neuropile zone. The postsynaptic terminals were seen to contain subsynaptic cisterns formed by membranes of smooth endoplasmic reticulum beneath the postsynaptic density, whereas the presynaptic terminal showed numerous electron transparent synaptic vesicles. From the neurophylogenetic perspectives, the ultrastructural characteristics of the central nervous tissue of the Onychophora show important evolutionary acquirements, such as the presence of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, indicating functional synaptic transmission, and the appearance of mature glial cells.",M1
18457026,"Psychotropic drug tenoten activates mitogen-activated MAP/ERK kinase regulatory cascade controlling the neuroprotective effects.For evaluation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of tenoten, a preparation based on ultralow-dose antibodies to S100 proteins and intended for the therapy of anxious and depressive disorders, we studied its influence on mitogen-activated ERK kinase cascade in Helix lucorum subpharyngeal <e>ganglion</e> complex. Western blot analysis showed that incubation of the ganglion preparation with tenoten resulted in significant activation of mitogen-activated ERK kinases, which was reduced by PD98059 (blocker of upstream protein kinase). This attests to a specific effect of the drug on mitogen-activated ERK kinase cascade. It is hypothesized that the therapeutic efficiency of tenoten is realed to activation of mitogen-activated ERK kinase cascade.",M1
18394958,"Distribution of corazonin and pigment-dispersing factor in the cephalic ganglia of termites.Distribution of neurones detectable with antisera to the corazonin (Crz) and the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) was mapped in the workers or pseudergates of 10 species representing six out of seven termite families. All species contained two triads of Crz-immunoreactive (Crz-ir) neurones in the protocerebrum. Their fibres were linked to the opposite hemisphere, formed a network in the fronto-lateral protocerebrum, and projected to the corpora cardiaca (CC); in most species the fibres also supplied the deuto- and tritocerebrum and the frontal <e>ganglion</e>. Some species possessed additional Crz-ir perikarya in the protocerebrum and the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG). The PDF-ir somata were primarily located in the optic lobe (OL) and SOG. OL harboured a group (3 groups in Coptotermes) of 2-6 PDF-ir cells with processes extending to the medulla, connecting to the contralateral OL, forming 1-2 networks in the protocerebrum, and in most species running also to CC. Such a PDF-ir system associated with the OL was missing in Reticulitermes. Except for Mastotermes, the termites contained 1-2 PDF-ir cell pairs in the SOG and two species had additional perikarya in the protocerebrum. The results are consistent with the view of a monophyletic termite origin and demonstrate how the Crz-ir and PDF-ir systems diversified in the course of termite phylogeny.",M1

Recognizing this entity is important to avoid misdiagnosis of other neural proliferations, especially in cases involving focal tongue burning.",M1
18365004,"Neuroarchitecture of aminergic systems in the larval ventral <e>ganglion</e> of Drosophila melanogaster.Biogenic amines are important signaling molecules in the central nervous system of both vertebrates and invertebrates. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, biogenic amines take part in the regulation of various vital physiological processes such as feeding, learning/memory, locomotion, sexual behavior, and sleep/arousal. Consequently, several morphological studies have analyzed the distribution of aminergic neurons in the CNS. Previous descriptions, however, did not determine the exact spatial location of aminergic neurite arborizations within the neuropil. The release sites and pre-/postsynaptic compartments of aminergic neurons also remained largely unidentified. We here used gal4-driven marker gene expression and immunocytochemistry to map presumed serotonergic (5-HT), dopaminergic, and tyraminergic/octopaminergic neurons in the thoracic and abdominal neuromeres of the Drosophila larval ventral ganglion relying on Fasciclin2-immunoreactive tracts as three-dimensional landmarks. With tyrosine hydroxylase- (TH) or tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (TDC2)-specific gal4-drivers, we also analyzed the distribution of ectopically expressed neuronal compartment markers in presumptive dopaminergic TH and tyraminergic/octopaminergic TDC2 neurons, respectively. Our results suggest that thoracic and abdominal 5-HT and TH neurons are exclusively interneurons whereas most TDC2 neurons are efferent. 5-HT and TH neurons are ideally positioned to integrate sensory information and to modulate neuronal transmission within the ventral ganglion, while most TDC2 neurons appear to act peripherally. In contrast to 5-HT neurons, TH and TDC2 neurons each comprise morphologically different neuron subsets with separated in- and output compartments in specific neuropil regions. The three-dimensional mapping of aminergic neurons now facilitates the identification of neuronal network contacts and co-localized signaling molecules, as exemplified for DOPA decarboxylase-synthesizing neurons that co-express crustacean cardioactive peptide and myoinhibiting peptides.",M1
18321399,"Neural models and physiological reality.Neural models of retinal processing provide an important tool for analyzing retinal signals and their functional significance. However, it is here argued that in biological reality, retinal connectivity is unlikely to be as specific as ideal neural models might suggest. The retina is thought to provide functionally specific signals, but this specificity is unlikely to be anatomically complete. This is illustrated by examples of cone connectivity to macaque <e>ganglion</e> cells. For example, cells of the magnocellular pathway appear to avoid short-wavelength cone input, so that such input is negligible under normal conditions. However, there is anatomical, physiological, and psychophysical evidence that under special conditions, weak input may be revealed. Second, ideal models of how retinal information is centrally utilized have to take into account the biological reality of retinal signals. The stochastic nature of impulse trains modifies signal-to-noise ratio in unexpected ways. Also, non-linearities in cell responses make, for example, multiplexing of luminance and chromatic signals in the parvocellular pathway impracticable. The purpose of this analysis is to show than ideal neural models must confront an often more complex and nuanced physiological reality.",M1

METHODS: The animals were divided into three groups: Group A--normal fetuses from pregnant rats that were not administered ETU; Group B--fetuses without ARM born from pregnant rats that were administered ETU and Group C--fetuses with ARM born from pregnant rats that received ETU. ETU was administered on the 11th day of pregnancy at the dose of 125 mg/kg body weight by gastric gavage. The rats had cesarean section on the 21st day of gestation. The fetuses terminal bowel tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry to demonstrate ganglion cells. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between groups A, B and C regarding ganglion cell densities. Group A had the highest cell density, followed by Group B and the lowest density was found in Group C. CONCLUSION: Ganglion cell densities are decreased in the terminal bowel of rats with ARM.",M1
18221939,"Identification and developmental expression of mRNAs encoding putative insect cuticle hardening hormone, bursicon in the green shore crab Carcinus maenas.Bursicon is the ultimate hormone in insect ecdysis, which is involved in cuticle hardening. Here we show that mRNAs encoding the heterodimeric cystine knot protein bursicon (Burs alpha, beta), are present in crustaceans, suggesting ubiquity of this hormone in arthropods. We firstly report the cloning, sequencing of mRNAs encoding subunits from the water flea, Daphnia arenata and the CNS of the crab, Carcinus maenas, in comparison with insect bursicon subunits. Expression patterns of alpha and beta burs mRNAs were examined by in-situ hybridisation (ISH) and quantitative RT-PCR. In the thoracic <e>ganglion</e>, burs alpha and beta mRNAs were completely colocalised in neurones expressing crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP). However, in the brain and eyestalk, bursicon transcripts were never observed, despite a complex expression pattern of CCAP interneurones. Patterns of expression of burs alpha and beta mRNAs were constitutive during the moult cycle of adult crabs, in stark contrast to the situation in insects. Whilst copy numbers of burs beta transcripts closely matched those of CCAP, those of burs alpha mRNA were around 3-fold higher than burs beta. This pattern was apparent during embryogenesis, where bursicon transcripts were first observed at around 50% development-the same time as first expression of CCAP mRNA. Transcript ratios (burs alpha: beta) increased during development. Our studies have shown, for the first time, that bursicon mRNAs are expressed in identified neurones in the nervous system of crustaceans. These findings will now promote further investigation into the functions of bursicon during the moult cycle and development of crustaceans.",M1
18046635,"A modeling comparison of projection neuron- and neuromodulator-elicited oscillations in a central pattern generating network.Many central pattern generating networks are influenced by synaptic input from modulatory projection neurons. The network response to a projection neuron is sometimes mimicked by bath applying the neuronally-released modulator, despite the absence of network interactions with the projection neuron. One interesting example occurs in the crab stomatogastric <e>ganglion</e> (STG), where bath applying the neuropeptide pyrokinin (PK) elicits a gastric mill rhythm which is similar to that elicited by the projection neuron modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1), despite the absence of PK in MCN1 and the fact that MCN1 is not active during the PK-elicited rhythm. MCN1 terminals have fast and slow synaptic actions on the gastric mill network and are presynaptically inhibited by this network in the STG. These local connections are inactive in the PK-elicited rhythm, and the mechanism underlying this rhythm is unknown. We use mathematical and biophysically-realistic modeling to propose potential mechanisms by which PK can elicit a gastric mill rhythm that is similar to the MCN1-elicited rhythm. We analyze slow-wave network oscillations using simplified mathematical models and, in parallel, develop biophysically-realistic models that account for fast, action potential-driven oscillations and some spatial structure of the network neurons. Our results illustrate how the actions of bath-applied neuromodulators can mimic those of descending projection neurons through mathematically similar but physiologically distinct mechanisms.",M1
18046580,"Co-localization and unique distributions of two clock proteins CYCLE and CLOCK in the cephalic ganglia of the ground cricket, Allonemobius allardi.CYCLE (CYC) and CLOCK (CLK) are transcriptional activators of the circadian clock genes, period (per) and timeless (tim), binding at E-boxes of their upstream regulatory region in Drosophila. CYC-like and CLK-like immunohistochemical reactivities (CYC-ir and CLK-ir) were investigated in the ground cricket, Allonemobius allardi, in which immunohistochemical reactivities for three circadian clock proteins (PERIOD, Doubletime, and Cryptochrome), two neuropeptides (crustacean cardioactive peptide and diapause hormone), and arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase had previously been mapped in the brain-subesophageal <e>ganglion</e> (SOG) complex. CYC-ir and CLK-ir occurred predominantly in the cytoplasm of the neurons distributed mainly in the central brain, SOG, and corpora cardiaca. Double-labeling experiments showed that CYC-ir and CLK-ir were co-localized only in the mandibular and maxillary neuromeres of the SOG. The neuronal processes in the dorsolateral region of the protocerebrum partially shared the immunoreactivities, whereas most of the other immunoreactivities were unique. The optic lobe showed reactivity to anti-CYC at small proximal frontodorsal cells and to anti-CLK at small proximal frontoventral cells. The frontal ganglion exhibited CYC-ir in the cell bodies that lacked CLK-ir. No difference in their number, distribution, or staining intensity was found between sampling under light:dark regimes of 16:8 and 12:12. The levels of both CYC-ir and CLK-ir showed no oscillation throughout a 24-h period. The co-localization pattern suggests that the midline cells of the SOG share most of the circadian-related immunoreactivities, thus constituting the heart of the circadian clock in A. allardi.",M1

17971452,"Highly conserved sequences mediate the dynamic interplay of basic helix-loop-helix proteins regulating retinogenesis.The atonal homolog 5 (ATH5) protein is central to the transcriptional network regulating the specification of retinal <e>ganglion</e> cells, and its expression comes under the spatiotemporal control of several basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins in the course of retina development. Monitoring the in vivo occupancy of the ATH5 promoter by the ATH5, Ngn2, and NeuroM proteins and analyzing the DNA motifs they bind, we show that three evolutionarily conserved E-boxes are required for the bHLH proteins to control the different phases of ATH5 expression. E-box 4 mediates the activity of Ngn2, ATH5, and NeuroM along the pathway leading to the conversion of progenitors into newborn neurons. E-box 1, by mediating the antagonistic effects of Ngn2 and HES1 in proliferating progenitors, controls the expansion of the ATH5 expression domain in early retina. E-box 2 is required for the positive feedback by ATH5 that underlies the up-regulation of ATH5 expression when progenitors are going through their last cell cycle. The combinatorial nature of the regulation of the ATH5 promoter suggests that the bHLH proteins involved have no assigned E-boxes but use a common set at which they either cooperate or compete to finely tune ATH5 expression as development proceeds.",M1
17915207,"Spatiotemporal patterns of neurogenesis in the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica.Incorporation of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to assess cytogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS) of the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica. A series of timed cumulative labelings carried out from 45 minutes (min) to 8 hours (h) after fertilization provided labeling patterns that showed when neurons and support cells residing at specific sites within the 9 h CNS became postmitotic. Throughout the CNS, which includes the cerebral <e>ganglion</e>, caudal ganglion and caudal nerve cord, neurogenesis occurs during an earlier time window than the genesis of support cells. Neurons are first generated at about 45 min to 1 h after fertilization in all 3 CNS regions, starting in the cerebral ganglion. Support cells are generated starting at about 2 h after fertilization. In both the cerebral ganglion and the caudal ganglion, neurons born during different time epochs settle in a specific spatial pattern, following a caudal to rostral gradient in the caudal ganglion and a more complex pattern in the cerebral ganglion. No such regional pattern was seen in the caudal nerve cord, where neurons born during different epochs were evenly distributed along the length of the cord. In the cerebral ganglion a small subpopulation of cells continued to incorporate BrdU from 8 h to at least 15 h and may represent a reserve of stem cells or progenitor cells that generate additional cells seen in the adult. The results show that this simple urochordate exhibits several vertebrate features of CNS cytogenesis, including a different timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis (support cells being the likely candidates for glial cells in Oikopleura), gradients of neuron position according to birthdate, and a maintenance of neural cell precursors beyond embryonic and larval stages.",M1
17690236,"Multiple modulators act on the cardiac <e>ganglion</e> of the crab, Cancer borealis.Neuromodulators can change the output of neural circuits. The crustacean cardiac ganglion (CG) drives the contractions of the heart. The CG is a direct target for neurohormones that are released from the pericardial organs and other neuroendocrine sites. In this study, we have characterized for the first time the physiological actions of the peptides red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH), Cancer borealis tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP Ia) and allatostatin III type A (AST-3) on the isolated CG of the crab, Cancer borealis. RPCH and CabTRP Ia excited the CG while AST-3 strongly inhibited its motor output. We also studied the actions of other peptides and small molecule transmitters known to be present in C. borealis. Dopamine, serotonin, proctolin, crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), a number of extended FLRFamide peptides, and cholinergic agonists increased the activity of the CG, GABA inhibited the CG, while other substances had little or no significant effect on the CG motor pattern. These results demonstrate, in one species, that the CG is multiply modulated. We suggest that multiple modulators may be important to regulate and coordinate the activity of the heart and other organs in response to external stimuli or the endogenous physiological state.",M1
17681526,"Effect of tyramine and stress on sex-pheromone production in the pre- and post-mating silkworm moth, Bombyx mori.Tyramine (TA) increased significantly after mating, whereas there were no significant differences in octopamine (OA) and dopamine (DA) levels in the brain-suboesophageal <e>ganglion</e> (SOG) complexes between virgin and mated females. The effects of various biogenic amines were tested on pheromone production of virgin and mated females of the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori. After 8h a significant reduction by TA (46%) was observed. Meanwhile, when OA or DA was injected, a significant increase of pheromone titer was observed in both virgin and mated females. This study also presents evidence for an increase in levels of OA and DA in the brain-SOG complexes in response to mechanical stress in B. mori female. TA suppressed pheromone production in an in vitro pheromone gland (PG) homogenate preparation, thus suggesting that the target of TA is the PG. TA inhibited pheromone production in vitro in a dose-dependent manner and DA had a lower inhibitory activity than TA, whereas OA had no effect, suggesting that TA is a candidate for regulating pheromone production in the PG, although other factors could be responsible for the pheromonostatic function.",M1

17518598,"Interconnected network of <e>ganglion</e>-like neural cell spheres formed on hydrozoan skeleton.Identifying scaffolds supporting in vitro reconstruction of active neuronal tissues in their 3-dimensional (3D) conformation is a major challenge in tissue engineering. We have previously shown that aragonite coral exoskeletons support the development of neuronal tissue from hippocampal neurons and astrocytes. Here we show for the first time that the porous aragonite skeleton obtained from bio-fabricated hydrozoan Millepora dichotoma supports the spontaneous organization of dissociated hippocampal cells into highly interconnected 3D ganglion-like tissue formations. The ganglion-like cell spheres expanded hundreds of microns across and included hundreds to thousands of astrocytes and mature neurons, most of them having only cell-cell and no cell-surface interactions. The spheres were linked to the surface directly or through a neck of cells and were interconnected through thick bundles of dendrites, varicosity-bearing axons, and astrocytic processes. Thus, M. dichotoma exoskeleton is a novel scaffold with the unprecedented ability to support a highly ordered organization of neuronal tissue. This unexpected organization opens new opportunities for neuronal tissue regeneration, because the spheres resemble in vivo nervous tissue having high volume of cells associated primarily through cell-cell rather than cell-matrix interactions.",M1
17516712,"Rho GTPase/Rho kinase inhibition as a novel target for the treatment of glaucoma.Rho kinase (ROCK1 and ROCK2) is a serine/threonine kinase that serves as an important downstream effector of Rho GTPase, and plays a critical role in regulating the contractile tone of smooth muscle tissues in a calcium-independent manner. Several lines of experimental evidence indicate that modulating ROCK activity within the aqueous humor outflow pathway using selective inhibitors could achieve very significant benefits for the treatment of increased intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. The rationale for such an approach stems from experimental data suggesting that both ROCK and Rho GTPase inhibitors can increase aqueous humor drainage through the trabecular meshwork, leading to a decrease in intraocular pressure. In addition to their ocular hypotensive properties, inhibitors of both ROCK and Rho GTPase have been shown to enhance ocular blood flow, retinal <e>ganglion</e> cell survival and axon regeneration. These properties of the ROCK and Rho GTPase inhibitors indicate that targeting the Rho GTPase/ROCK pathway with selective inhibitors represents a novel therapeutic approach aimed at lowering increased intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients.",M1

We have examined individually stained metathoracic DUM neurons, their dendritic projection patterns, and their relationship to specific architectural features of the metathoracic ganglion, such as longitudinal tracts, transverse commissures, and well-defined sensory neuropils. The detailed branching patterns of individually characterized DUM neurons of various types were analyzed in vibratome sections in which architectural features were revealed by using antibodies against tubulin and synapsin. Whereas DUM3,4,5 and DUM5 neurons (the group innervating leg and  non-wing-power  muscles) had many ventral and dorsal branches, DUM1 and DUM3,4 neurons (innervating  wing-power  muscles) branched extensively only in dorsal areas. The structure of DUM3 neurons differed markedly from that of the other DUM neurons examined in that they sent branches into dorsal areas and had differently structured side branches that mostly extended laterally. The differences between the branching patterns of these neurons were quantified by using currently available new reconstruction algorithms. These structural differences between the various classes of DUM neurons corresponded to differences in their function and biophysical properties.",M1
17492623,"Development of the caudal nerve cord, motoneurons, and muscle innervation in the appendicularian urochordate Oikopleura dioica.The development of the caudal nerve cord and muscle innervation in the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica was assessed using differential interference contrast and confocal microscopy, phalloidin staining of actin, and in situ hybridization for the neuronal markers tubulin and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). The caudal nerve cord first appears as a stream of tubulin mRNA-positive neurons that extends into the tail from the caudal <e>ganglion</e>. By this stage a few actin-rich nerve fibers course longitudinally along the cord. As the tail lengthens, the caudal nerve cord extends and becomes more fasciculated and the neurons cluster at stereotyped longitudinal positions. The number of neurons in the nerve cord reaches a relatively stable maximum of about 29. A subset of neurons in the caudal ganglion and caudal nerve cord expresses ChAT mRNA. These putative motoneurons are distributed along nearly the full extent of the tail in numbers consistent with an independent innervation of each tail muscle cell. The longitudinal series of putative motoneurons is not aligned with the muscle cells, but peripheral nerve fibers extending to the muscle cells are, indicating that motor axons grow along the cord before exiting adjacent to their peripheral target. Muscle innervation occurs roughly coincident with the onset of ChAT mRNA expression. Our results provide the first molecular identification of motoneurons and the first developmental characterization of the motor system in an appendicularian and help set the stage for gene expression studies aimed at understanding the evolution of developmental patterning in this part of the chordate central nervous system.",M1
17475424,"Time course of cochlear electrophysiology and morphology after combined administration of kanamycin and furosemide.In animal models of deafness, administration of an aminoglycoside in combination with a loop diuretic is often applied to produce a rapid loss of cochlear hair cells. However, the extent to which surviving hair cells remain functional after such a deafening procedure varies. In a longitudinal electrocochleographical study, we investigated the variability of cochlear function between and within guinea pigs after combined administration of kanamycin and furosemide. Concurrently, histological data were obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after deafening treatment. The main measures in our study were compound action potential (CAP) thresholds, percentage of surviving hair cells and packing density of spiral <e>ganglion</e> cells (SGCs). One day after deafening treatment, we found threshold shifts widely varying among animals from 0 to 100dB. The variability decreased after 2 days, and in 18 out of 20 animals threshold shifts greater than 55dB were found 4-7 days after deafening. Remarkably, in the majority of animals, thresholds decreased by up to 25dB after 7 days indicating functional recovery. As expected, final thresholds were negatively correlated to the percentage of surviving hair cells. Notably, the percentage of surviving hair cells might be predicted on the basis of thresholds observed one day after deafening. SGC packing density, which rapidly decreased with the period after deafening treatment and correlated to the percentage of surviving inner hair cells, was not a determining factor for the CAP thresholds.",M1
17371390,"The distribution of <e>ganglion</e> cells in the equine retina and its relationship to skull morphology.It has recently been reported that a strong correlation exists between the distribution of retinal ganglion cells and nose length in the domestic dog.

There was a significant variation in the density of ganglion cells found across the retinae. Breed was a significant predictor for ganglion cell density within the visual streak. A strong positive correlation exists between the density of ganglion cells in the visual streak and nasal length. Significant variation was also seen in the area centralis but did not correlate with any of the recorded skull measurements.

17310502,"CEACAM1/VEGF cross-talk during neuroblastic tumour differentiation.The role of angiogenesis in tumour progression is a major subject in modern oncology and a correlation between angiogenesis and poor outcome has been demonstrated for human neuroblastomas. However, the role of angiogenesis in the maturation phase of neuroblastic tumours has never been considered. Human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), a potent pro-angiogenic factor and mediator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis, plays a crucial role during the activation phase of angiogenesis and it has been shown to be expressed in the microvessels of the developing central nervous system as well as in newly formed immature blood vessels in many different tumours and under physiological conditions. The present study has investigated the role of CEACAM1/VEGF-mediated angiogenesis across the whole spectrum of neuroblastic tumours, from undifferentiated to fully differentiated mature ganglioneuromas. CEACAM1 is peculiarly expressed in the microvessels of areas of active tumour maturation among differentiating neuroblastic/<e>ganglion</e> cells, whereas it is completely absent in the vessels of poorly differentiated/undifferentiated as well as in entirely mature Schwannian-rich areas. Interestingly, VEGF expression has been found in differentiating neuroblastic/ganglion cells adjacent to CEACAM1-positive microvessels. In keeping with these observations, VEGF expression was found in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells during differentiation after retinoic acid treatment. Moreover, conditioned medium from SH-SY5Y cells collected at different stages of differentiation induced progressive in vitro up-regulation of CEACAM1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that was abrogated by the specific VEGF receptor-2/KDR inhibitor SU5416. Taken together, these data point to a role for CEACAM1/VEGF cross-talk during the maturation phase of neuroblastic tumours. This may mimic physiological events leading to maturation of the vasculature in the developing normal central nervous system. On the other hand, in poorly differentiated/undifferentiated lesions, VEGF-sustained angiogenesis does not reproduce physiological steps, but rather is associated with tumour aggressiveness and may involve other molecular pathways.",M1
17279410,"[Intestinal neuronal dysplasia type B: how do we understand it today?]Intestinal neuronal dysplasia type B (IND B) is currently considered to be a subtle malformation of the submucosal plexus, leading to an increased proportion of over-sized ganglia and potentially accompanied by a mild, chronic gastrointestinal motility disturbance. The diagnosis of IND B is morphologically based and involves the demonstration of an increased proportion of giant ganglia in the submucous plexus related to the patient's age. Giant ganglia are physiologically frequent in the neonatal period. Therefore, IND B should not be diagnosed prior to 1 year of age. Morphological features of IND B may occur as an isolated finding or may be observed proximal to an aganglionic segment. IND B and constipation may resolve spontaneously up to the age of 4 years. Treatment of IND B is usually conservative, surgical resection is currently deemed necessary only in a minority of patients. The pathogenesis of IND B is still incompletely understood and the etiology unknown. Future research on the basis of standardized diagnostic conditions is expected to result in a better understanding of this disease, and to reveal the cause of aberrant <e>ganglion</e> development.",M1
17275825,"An experimental evaluation of host specificity: the role of encounter and compatibility filters for a rhizocephalan parasite of crabs.The encounter/compatibility paradigm of host specificity provides three qualitative pathways to the success or failure of a potential host-parasite interaction. It is usually impossible to distinguish between two of these (encounter and compatibility filters closed versus encounter filter open and compatibility filter closed) because unsuccessful infection attempts are difficult to observe in nature. We were able to open the encounter filter under experimental laboratory conditions. Our analytical system used the rhizocephalan barnacle, Sacculina carcini, a parasitic castrator of the European green crab, Carcinus maenas, and Pachygrapsus marmoratus, a native European crab that occurs with C. maenas but is not parasitized by S. carcini in nature. Penetration followed by unsuccessful infection of P. marmoratus crabs by parasitic barnacle larvae leaves a uniquely permanent record in the thoracic <e>ganglion</e> of the crabs. This provided us with a novel tool to quantify the encounter filter in a host-parasite system in nature. We demonstrated, in the laboratory, that the compatibility filter was closed and that, in nature, even where barnacle larvae were present, the encounter filter was also effectively closed. The closure of both filters in nature explains the failure of this potential host-parasite interaction, an outcome favored by selection in both host and parasite.",M1
17267480,"CTCF-dependent chromatin boundary element between the latency-associated transcript and ICP0 promoters in the herpes simplex virus type 1 genome.Cells latently infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) contain nucleosomal DNA similar to that of host cell chromatin. Recent studies have demonstrated that histones in the latency-associated transcript (LAT) promoter and intron regions contain histone modifications permissive for transcription. However, those histones associated with the lytic-specific ICP0 gene, which lies only 5 kb away, contain modifications typical of silenced chromatin. How this active chromatin is kept separate from the repressed chromatin in the nearby ICP0 region remains crucial to the understanding of the HSV lytic cycle. In this study, we show that the LAT intron region contains an insulator. Specifically, we show that an 800-bp region from the LAT intron can block enhancers in both tissue culture cells and Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Importantly, the 800-bp HSV insulator protects a LAT transgene from positional effects in Drosophila eye tissue. The 800-bp region contains nine copies of 16-bp repeats. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that CTCF interacts with the CTCCC sequence within the repeats. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that CTCF interacts with these repeats in latently infected trigeminal <e>ganglion</e> neurons. The deletion of these repeats impaired insulator activity in human K562 cells and Drosophila embryos. Finally, double-spaced RNA knockdown of CTCF disrupts enhancer-blocking activity of the LAT insulator in transfected Drosophila S3 cells. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the 800-bp DNA in the LAT intron region works as a chromatin boundary during latency to separate active chromatin associated with the LAT promoter region from repressed chromatin in the ICP0 gene.",M1

17151870,"Neurohormones as putative circadian clock output signals in the central nervous system of two cricket species.Antisera to the neuropeptides corazonin (Crz) and crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) and to the diapause hormone (DH) react with small sets of neurones in the cephalic ganglia of the crickets Dianemobius nigrofasciatus and Allonemobius allardi. The distribution of their immunoreactivities is similar in the two species and overlaps with the locations of presumed circadian clock components in the optic lobes, protocerebrum, tritocerebrum, suboesophageal <e>ganglion</e> (SOG) and frontal ganglion. D. nigrofasciatus contains two Crz-immunoreactive (Crz-ir) cells in each optic lobe, six cell groups in the protocerebrum, four in the tritocerebrum, and one in SOG, whereas A. allardi harbours only five Crz-ir groups in the protocerebrum and four in the tritocerebrum. CCAP immunoreactivity occurs in both species in four protocerebrum cell clusters, four tritocerebrum cell clusters, four SOG cell clusters, one frontal ganglion cell cluster, and two optic lobe cell clusters; D. nigrofasciatus possesses two additional cells with unique links to the lamina in the optic lobe. DH-related antigens are present in four cell clusters in the optic lobe, six (D. nigrofasciatus) or eight (A. allardi) in the protocerebrum, four in the tritocerebrum, and three (A. allardi) or five (D. nigrofasciatus) in the SOG. Some of the detected cells also react with antibody to the clock protein Period (PER) or lie close to PER-ir cells. Crickets reared at two different photoperiods do not differ in the distribution and intensity of immunoreactivities. No changes have been detected during the course of diurnal light/dark cycles, possibly because the antisera react with persistent prohormones, whereas circadian fluctuations may occur at the level of their processing or of hormone release. The projection of immunoreactive fibres to several brain regions, the stomatogastric nervous system and the neurohaemal organs indicates multiple functions of the respective hormones.",M1

16897010,"Location and variability of epicardiac ganglia in human fetuses.The aim of the study was to determine the morphology of epicardiac ganglia in human fetuses at different stages of their development as these ganglia are considered to be of a pivotal clinical importance. Twenty-one fetal hearts were investigated applying a technique of histochemistry for acetylcholinesterase to visualize the epicardiac neural ganglionated plexus with its subsequent stereoscopic examination on total organs. In all of the examined fetuses, epicardiac neural plexus with numerous ganglia was well recognizable and could be clearly differentiated into seven ganglionated subplexuses, topography and structural organization of which were typical for hearts of adult human. The largest <e>ganglion</e> number comprising 77% of all counted ganglia was identified on the dorsal atrial surface. Fetal epicardiac plexus in gestation period of 15-40 weeks contained 929 +/- 62 ganglia, but ganglion amount did vary substantially from heart to heart. In conclusion, this study implies that the human fetal epicardiac ganglia occupy their definitive location already at gestation period from 15 weeks and their number as well as distribution on heart surface presumably is not age dependent.",M1
16894610,"Regulation of the neurofibromatosis 2 gene promoter expression during embryonic development.Mutations in the Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene are associated with predisposition to vestibular schwannomas, spinal schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. Presently, how NF2 is expressed during embryonic development and in the tissues affected by neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) has not been well defined. To examine NF2 expression in vivo, we generated transgenic mice carrying a 2.4-kb NF2 promoter driving beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) with a nuclear localization signal. Whole-mount embryo staining revealed that the NF2 promoter directed beta-gal expression as early as embryonic day E5.5. Strong expression was detected at E6.5 in the embryonic ectoderm containing many mitotic cells. beta-gal staining was also found in parts of embryonic endoderm and mesoderm. The beta-gal staining pattern in the embryonic tissues was corroborated by in situ hybridization analysis of endogenous Nf2 RNA expression. Importantly, we observed strong NF2 promoter activity in the developing brain and in sites containing migrating cells including the neural tube closure, branchial arches, dorsal aorta, and paraaortic splanchnopleura. Furthermore, we noted a transient change of NF2 promoter activity during neural crest cell migration. While little beta-gal activity was detected in premigratory neural crest cells at the dorsal ridge region of the neural fold, significant activity was seen in the neural crest cells already migrating away from the dorsal neural tube. In addition, we detected considerable NF2 promoter activity in various NF2-affected tissues such as acoustic <e>ganglion</e>, trigeminal ganglion, spinal ganglia, optic chiasma, the ependymal cell-containing tela choroidea, and the pigmented epithelium of the retina. The NF2 promoter expression pattern during embryogenesis suggests a specific regulation of the NF2 gene during neural crest cell migration and further supports the role of merlin in cell adhesion, motility, and proliferation during development.",M1
16857875,"Neuromodulation of the locust frontal <e>ganglion</e> during the moult: a novel role for insect ecdysis peptides.In insects, continuous growth requires the periodic replacement of the exoskeleton during the moult. A moulting insect displays a stereotypical set of behaviours that culminate in the shedding of the old cuticle at ecdysis. Moulting is an intricate process requiring tightly regulated physiological changes and behaviours to allow integration of environmental cues and to ensure the proper timing and sequence of its components. This is under complex hormonal regulation, and is an important point of interaction between endocrine and neural control. Here, we focus on the locust frontal ganglion (FG), an important player in moulting behaviour, as a previously unexplored target for ecdysis peptides. We show that application of 10(-7) mol l(-1) ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH) or 10(-7) mol l(-1) and 10(-6) mol l(-1) Pre-ecdysis-triggering hormone (PETH) to an isolated FG preparation caused an increase in bursting frequency in the FG, whereas application of 10(-6) mol l(-1) eclosion hormone (EH) caused an instantaneous, though temporary, total inhibition of all FG rhythmic activity. Crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), an important peptide believed to turn on ecdysis behaviour, caused a dose-dependent increase of FG burst frequency. Our results imply a novel role for this peptide in generating air-swallowing behaviour during the early stages of ecdysis. Furthermore, we show that the modulatory effects of CCAP on the FG motor circuits are dependent on behavioural state and physiological context. Thus, we report that pre-treatment with ETH caused CCAP-induced effects similar to those induced by CCAP alone during pre-ecdysis. Thus, the action of CCAP seems to depend on pre-exposure to ETH, which is thought to be released before CCAP in vivo.",M1
16855108,"Heterogeneous potassium conductances contribute to the diverse firing properties of postnatal mouse vestibular <e>ganglion</e> neurons.How mechanical information is encoded in the vestibular periphery has not been clarified. To begin to address the issue we examined the intrinsic firing properties of postnatal mouse vestibular ganglion neurons using the whole cell, tight-seal technique in current-clamp mode. We categorized two populations of neurons based on the threshold required to evoke an action potential. Low-threshold neurons fired with an average minimum current injection of -43 pA, whereas high-threshold neurons required -176 pA. Using sine-wave stimuli, we found that the neurons were inherently tuned with best frequencies that ranged up to 40 Hz. To investigate the membrane properties that contributed to the variability in firing properties we examined the same neurons in voltage-clamp mode. High-threshold neurons had larger cell bodies and whole cell capacitances but a resting conductance density of 0.18 nS/pF, nearly identical to that of low-threshold neurons, suggesting that cell size was an important parameter determining threshold. We also found that vestibular ganglion neurons expressed a heterogeneous population of potassium conductances. TEA-sensitive conductances contributed to the position of the tuning curve in the frequency domain. A 4-AP-sensitive conductance was active at rest and hyperpolarized resting potential, limited spontaneous activity, raised threshold, and prevented repetitive firing. In response to sine-wave stimulation 4-AP-sensitive conductances prevented action potential generation at low frequencies and thus contributed to the high-pass corner of the tuning curve. The mean low-pass corner (about 29 Hz) was determined by the membrane time constant. Together these factors contributed to the sharply tuned, band-pass characteristics intrinsic to postnatal vestibular ganglion neurons.",M1
16849836,"Ganglionic adrenergic action modulates ovarian steroids and nitric oxide in prepubertal rat.Both peripheral innervation and nitric oxide (NO) participate in ovarian steroidogenesis. The purpose of this work was to analyse the ganglionic adrenergic influence on the ovarian release of steroids and NO and the possible steroids/NO relationship. The experiments were carried out in the ex vivo coeliac <e>ganglion</e>-superior ovarian nerve (SON)-ovary system of prepubertal rats. The coeliac ganglion-SON-ovary system was incubated in Krebs Ringer-bicarbonate buffer in presence of adrenergic agents in the ganglionic compartment. The accumulation of progesterone, androstenedione, oestradiol and NO in the ovarian incubation liquid was measured. Norepinephrine in coeliac ganglion inhibited the liberation of progesterone and increased androstenedione, oestradiol and NO in ovary. The addition of alpha and beta adrenergic antagonists also showed different responses in the liberation of the substances mentioned before, which, from a physiological point of view, reveals the presence of adrenergic receptors in coeliac ganglion. In relation to propranolol, it does not revert the effect of noradrenaline on the liberation of progesterone, which leads us to think that it might also have a  per se  effect on the ganglion, responsible for the ovarian response observed for progesterone. Finally, we can conclude that the ganglionic adrenergic action via SON participates on the regulation of the prepubertal ovary in one of two ways: either increasing the NO, a gaseous neurotransmitter with cytostatic characteristics, to favour the immature follicles to remain dormant or increasing the liberation of androstenedione and oestradiol, the steroids necessary for the beginning of the near first estral cycle.",M1
16790596,"Acid-sensing ionic channels in the rat vestibular endorgans and ganglia.Acid-sensing ionic channels (ASICs) are members of the epithelial Na+ channel/degenerin (ENaC/DEG) superfamily. ASICs are widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous system. They have been implicated in synaptic transmission, pain perception, and the mechanoreception in peripheral tissues. Our objective was to characterize proton-gated currents mediated by ASICs and to determine their immunolocation in the rat vestibular periphery. Voltage clamp of cultured afferent neurons from P7 to P10 rats showed a proton-gated current with rapid activation and complete desensitization, which was carried almost exclusively by sodium ions. The current response to protons (H+) has a pH0.5 of 6.2. This current was reversibly decreased by amiloride, gadolinium, lead, acetylsalicylic acid, and enhanced by FMRFamide and zinc, and negatively modulated by raising the extracellular calcium concentration. Functional expression of the current was correlated with smaller-capacitance neurons. Acidification of the extracellular pH generated action potentials in vestibular neurons, suggesting a functional role of ASICs in their excitability. Immunoreactivity to ASIC1a and ASIC2a subunits was found in small vestibular <e>ganglion</e> neurons and afferent fibers that run throughout the macula utricle and crista stroma. ASIC2b, ASIC3, and ASIC4 were expressed to a lesser degree in vestibular ganglion neurons. The ASIC1b subunit was not detected in the vestibular endorgans. No acid-pH-sensitive currents or ASIC immunoreactivity was found in hair cells. Our results indicate that proton-gated current is carried through ASICs and that ionic current activated by H+ contributes to shape the vestibular afferent neurons' response to its synaptic input.",M1
16707581,"Regulation of insect steroid hormone biosynthesis by innervating peptidergic neurons.In insects, steroid hormones named ecdysteroids elicit molting and metamorphosis. The prothoracic gland (PG) is a predominant source of ecdysteroids, where their biosynthesis (ecdysteroidogenesis) is regulated by several neuropeptides. Here, we report that FMRFamide-related peptides (FaRPs) regulate ecdysteroidogenesis through direct innervation of the PG in the silkworm Bombyx mori. We purified a previously uncharacterized Bombyx FaRP, DPSFIRFamide, and identified the corresponding Bombyx FMRFamide gene (Bommo-FMRFamide, BRFa), which encodes three additional FaRPs. All BRFa peptides suppressed ecdysteroidogenesis in the PG by reducing cAMP production by means of the receptor for Bommo-myosuppressin, another FaRP we have previously shown to act as a prothoracicostatic factor. BRFa is predominantly expressed in neurosecretory cells of thoracic ganglia, and the neurons in the prothoracic <e>ganglion</e> innervate the PG to supply all four peptides to the gland surface. Electrophysiological recordings during development confirmed the increased firing activity of BRFa neurons in stages with low PG activity and decreased ecdysteroid levels in the hemolymph. To our knowledge, this study provides the first report of peptides controlling ecdysteroidogenesis by direct innervation.",M1

During metamorphosis, the AG is lost. This loss had been postulated to occur through some form of programmed cell death (PCD), but it is possible for cells within the AG to be respecified or to migrate into adjacent ganglia. Evidence from histological sections is supported by results from a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, which indicate that cells of the AG degenerate by PCD. PCD occurs after metamorphic induction by serotonin or by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Cellular degeneration and nuclear condensation and loss were observed within 12 h of metamorphic induction by NOS inhibition and occur before loss of the velar lobes, the ciliated tissue used for larval swimming and feeding. Velar disintegration happens more rapidly after metamorphic induction by serotonin than by 7-nitroindazole, a NOS inhibitor. Loss of the AG was complete by 72 h after induction. Spontaneous loss of the AG in older competent larvae may arise from a natural decrease in endogenous NOS activity, giving rise to the tendency of aging larvae to display spontaneous metamorphosis in culture.",M1
16631756,"Molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding a crustacean hyperglycemic hormone from eyestalk ganglia of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus.Crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), a polypeptide with multiple physiological effects, was first identified in the X-organ/sinus gland neurosecretory system of the eyestalks. In studies reported here, we used a PCR-based cloning strategy (RT-PCR followed by 5'- and 3'-RACE) to clone from blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) eyestalk ganglia a cDNA (CsCHH-1) encoding a putative CHH preprohormone. Sequence analysis revealed the preprohormone included all structural features previously reported for CHH preprohormones: a signal peptide, a CHH precursor-related peptide (CPRP), the CHH polypeptide, and a C-terminal basic processing site. Further, the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature polypeptide included all signature domains previously reported for CHH. The primary structure of blue crab CHH is most closely related to CHH from other brachyurans. RT-PCR revealed the CsCHH-1 transcript was present in eyestalk ganglia, but was undetectable in other tissues tested. A transcript encoding a similar CHH-like preprohormone was detected in thoracic <e>ganglion</e>, ventral nerve cord, and brain, but was not detected in eyestalk ganglia.",M1
16621955,"Beyond the central pattern generator: amine modulation of decision-making neural pathways descending from the brain of the medicinal leech.The biological mechanisms of behavioral selection, as it relates to locomotion, are far from understood, even in relatively simple invertebrate animals. In the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, the decision to swim is distributed across populations of swim-activating and swim-inactivating neurons descending from the subesophageal <e>ganglion</e> of the compound cephalic ganglion, i.e. the brain. In the present study, we demonstrate that the serotonergic LL and Retzius cells in the brain are excited by swim-initiating stimuli and during spontaneous swim episodes. This activity likely influences or resets the neuromodulatory state of neural circuits involved in the activation or subsequent termination of locomotion. When serotonin (5-HT) was perfused over the brain, multi-unit recordings from descending brain neurons revealed rapid and substantial alterations. Subsequent intracellular recordings from identified command-like brain interneurons demonstrated that 5-HT, especially in combination with octopamine, inhibited swim-triggering neuron Tr1, as well as swim-inactivating neurons Tr2 and SIN1. Although 5-HT inhibited elements of the swim-inactivation pathway, rather than promoting them, the indirect and net effect of the amine was a reliable and sustained reduction in the firing of the segmental swim-gating neuron 204. This modulation caused cell 204 to relinquish its excitatory drive to the swim central pattern generator. The activation pattern of serotonergic brain neurons that we observed during swimming and the 5-HT-immunoreactive staining pattern obtained, suggest that within the head brain 5-HT secretion is massive. Over time, 5-HT secretion may provide a homeostatic feedback mechanism to limit swimming activity at the level of the head brain.",M1
16612808,"Allatotropin-like peptide in Heliothis virescens: tissue localization and quantification.The mating-induced increase in juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis in Heliothis virescens females may be stimulated by production and/or release of stimulatory neuropeptides such as allatotropins (AT). Although there is evidence that H. virescens allatotropin may be structurally related to Manduca sexta allatotropin (Manse-AT), little is known of its occurrence and distribution in H. virescens. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a monoclonal antibody against Manse-AT was used to quantify concentrations of Manse-AT immunoreactivity in tissue extracts of H. virescens. In mated females, the highest concentrations of Manse-AT-like material occurred in the brain. The ventral nervous system and the accessory glands also contained considerable amounts of Manse-AT-like material, whereas concentrations were very low in ovaries, fat body, and flight muscle. The Manse-AT antibody was used for whole-mount immunocytochemistry to localize Manse-AT-immunoreactivity in the central nervous system. Several groups of Manse-AT-immunoreactive cells were discovered in the brain, subesophageal <e>ganglion</e>, and thoracic and abdominal ganglia of H. virescens females and males. Strong immunoreactivity was detected in axons going through the corpora cardiaca and branching out over the surface of the corpora allata. The presence of Manse-AT-like material in various locations in the central nervous system suggests that these peptides may have other as yet unknown functions. At the posterior margin of the terminal ganglion of males, a group of large immunoreactive cells was observed that was not present in females. Other than that, there were no obvious differences between virgin and mated females or males. The lack of differences in AT distribution in mated and virgin females suggests that mating-induced differences in female JH biosynthesis rates may be caused by changes in cellular response to AT at the level of the CA, rather than by changes in the amounts of AT acting on the CA.",M1
16566843,"Comparison of P2X and TRPV1 receptors in ganglia or primary culture of trigeminal neurons and their modulation by NGF or serotonin.BACKGROUND: Cultured sensory neurons are a common experimental model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of pain transduction typically involving activation of ATP-sensitive P2X or capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 receptors. This applies also to trigeminal <e>ganglion</e> neurons that convey pain inputs from head tissues. Little is, however, known about the plasticity of these receptors on trigeminal neurons in culture, grown without adding the neurotrophin NGF which per se is a powerful algogen. The characteristics of such receptors after short-term culture were compared with those of ganglia. Furthermore, their modulation by chronically-applied serotonin or NGF was investigated. RESULTS: Rat or mouse neurons in culture mainly belonged to small and medium diameter neurons as observed in sections of trigeminal ganglia. Real time RT-PCR, Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry showed upregulation of P2X(3) and TRPV1 receptors after 1-4 days in culture (together with their more frequent co-localization), while P2X(2) ones were unchanged. TRPV1 immunoreactivity was, however, lower in mouse ganglia and cultures. Intracellular Ca(2+) imaging and whole-cell patch clamping showed functional P2X and TRPV1 receptors. Neurons exhibited a range of responses to the P2X agonist alpha, beta-methylene-adenosine-5'-triphosphate indicating the presence of homomeric P2X(3) receptors (selectively antagonized by A-317491) and heteromeric P2X(2/3) receptors. The latter were observed in 16 % mouse neurons only. Despite upregulation of receptors in culture, neurons retained the potential for further enhancement of P2X(3) receptors by 24 h NGF treatment. At this time point TRPV1 receptors had lost the facilitation observed after acute NGF application. Conversely, chronically-applied serotonin selectively upregulated TRPV1 receptors rather than P2X(3) receptors. CONCLUSION: Comparing ganglia and cultures offered the advantage of understanding early adaptive changes of nociception-transducing receptors of trigeminal neurons. Culturing did not prevent differential receptor upregulation by algogenic substances like NGF or serotonin, indicating that chronic application led to distinct plastic changes in the molecular mechanisms mediating pain on trigeminal nociceptors.",M1
16437384,"Partial urethral obstruction enhances NADPH-diaphorase activity in the monkey (Macaca fascicularis) bladder: light and electron microscopic studies.The effect of partially obstructing the urethra on the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity in neurons of the intramural ganglia of the monkey (Macaca fascicularis) bladder was examined by light and electron microscopy. Partial urethral ligation was done in adult male monkeys. The animals were sacrificed 2, 4 weeks after partial urethral obstruction. This was compared to controls (normal and sham operated). Urethral obstructed animals were observed to have increased urinary frequency and decreased urinary flow rate. Two weeks after urethral obstruction, the overall NADPH-d activity in the intramural ganglia of the bladder base was enhanced compared to control animals. The frequency of intensely stained NADPH-d positive neurons was increased compared to the control animals. About one-third of intensely stained NADPH-d positive neurons appeared to undergo degenerative changes. At 4 weeks after urethral obstruction, a wide occurrence of NADPH-d positive neurons in advanced stages of degeneration in the bladder base was observed. Cellular debris was strewn among normal looking <e>ganglion</e> cells and along the nerve processes. The proportion of intensely stained NADPH-d positive neurons was relatively lower than the controls. The total number of NADPH-d positive neurons and the nerve fibres in the entire bladder was significantly reduced when compared to control animals. Electron microscopy showed some NADPH-d activity in intramural ganglion cells in 2 weeks after partial urethral obstruction. NADPH-d reaction product (formazan) was deposited on the membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the outer membranes of some mitochondria in the intramural neuron. At 4 weeks after urethral obstruction, NADPH-d was present in the membrane of the mitochondria and some mitochondria appeared swollen with disrupted cristae. Present results show that NADPH-d activity in neurons of the intramural ganglia of the monkey (Macaca fascicularis) urinary bladder was increased after two weeks and reduced after 4 weeks of partial urethral obstruction. It is speculated that the increased NADPH-d activity associated with partial urethral obstruction would lead to neuronal damage and death, which may contribute to detrusor overactivity. However, it warrants further investigation to understand the mechanism of neuronal cell death after partial urethral obstruction.",M1
16427094,"Distribution of mRNA and binding sites of adrenoceptors and muscarinic receptors in the rat heart.Since there exist some obscurities in the expression of mRNAs and their receptors in the heart, we have investigated the gene expression (mRNA levels) of adrenoceptors (alpha1A-, alpha1B-, beta1-, beta2-, beta3-) and muscarinic receptors (M2) and the density of receptor binding sites (alpha1A-, alpha1B-, beta1-, beta2-adrenoceptors, muscarinic receptors). Moreover, the heart regions consist of tissue rich in <e>ganglion</e> cells (that are of importance in heart neural circuits) and those virtually free of them (myocytes). Therefore, we have examined the differences in the distribution of mRNAs/receptor binding sites in the atrial samples of the heart rich in ganglion cells vs. those are virtually free of them. Binding sites and mRNAs of muscarinic receptors and alpha1B-adrenoceptors differ in their distribution in different heart regions. The mRNAs for beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors were almost equally distributed herein, while the amount of beta-adrenoceptors significantly differs in the heart regions. The alpha1A- and beta3-adrenoceptors mRNAs were also found in all investigated heart regions, but at significantly lower level and have not shown region differences. This is a new finding, especially to beta3-adrenoceptors, as they were not regularly found in each heart regions. alpha1B-adrenoceptors have similar distribution of their mRNAs and binding sites in some heart parts. Thus, we can conclude that there are noticeable differences in the presence of receptors in heart regions that contain ganglion cells in comparison to those are virtually free of them.",M1

The neuron survival rate in control group was 87.4% +/- 8.6%, 83.4% +/- 8.5% 7 and 14 days after treatment respectively. There was significant difference between experimental group and control group. On 1st and 2nd day, no apoptosis was seen in spinal cord anterior horn of the rats in both experimental group and control group. On 3rd, 7th, and 14th day, the apoptosis index of spinal cord anterior horn motoneuron in experimental rats were lower (1.2+/-0.8, 1.4 +/- 0. 6, 4.1 +/- 1. 3) than that in the control group (2.1 +/- 1.1, 3.1 +/- 1.1, 6.1 +/- 1.8) (P &lt; 0.05). One, 2, and 3 days after the operation, no ganglion neurons apoptosis was observed in all rats. On 7th day the apoptosis index of ganglion neurons in experimental group(2.10 +/- 0.32) were lower than that in control group (4.40+/-0.56) (P&lt;0.05). On 14th day there was no significant difference in the apoptosis index of ganglion neurons between experimental group (4.30+/-1.80) and control group (6.70 +/- 2.50) (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Apoptosis of neurons occur after peripheral nerve injury in spinal cord and ganglion. OECs transplantation is effective in preventing apoptosis.",M1
16329038,"Immunocytochemical localization of metabotropic (mGluR2/3 and mGluR4a) and ionotropic (GluR2/3) glutamate receptors in adrenal medullary <e>ganglion</e> cells.The localization of metabotropic glutamate receptors of groups II (mGluR2/3) and III (mGluR4a) and the subunits 2 and 3 of alfa-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluR2/3) was investigated with immunocytochemical methods in the rat adrenal gland. MGluR2/3, mGluR4a and GluR2/3 immunoreactivities were observed in large-sized, centrally located type I adrenal medullary ganglion neurons. Furthermore, the small-sized type II adrenal ganglion neurons identified by their immunoreactivity to brain nitric oxide synthase (bNOS), also expressed mGluR2/3, mGluR4a and GluR2/3. These cells were disposed in the peripheral portion of the adrenal medulla. None of the type I neurons were positively labeled for bNOS. These morphological observations suggest that activation of glutamate receptors in ganglion neurons may be instrumental in the control of adrenal endocrine systems as well as blood regulation.",M1
16241269,"Electronic neuron within a <e>ganglion</e> of a leech (Hirudo medicinalis).We report the construction of an electronic device that models and replaces a neuron in a midbody ganglion of the leech Hirudo medicinalis. In order to test the behavior of our device, we used a well-characterized synaptic interaction between the mechanosensory, sensitive to pressure, (P) cell and the anteropagoda (because of the action potential shape) (AP) neuron. We alternatively stimulated a P neuron and our device connected to the AP neuron, and studied the response of the latter. The number and timing of the AP spikes were the same when the electronic parameters were properly adjusted. Moreover, after changes in the depolarization of the AP cell, the responses under the stimulation of both the biological neuron and the electronic device vary in a similar manner.",M1
16240240,"Immortalized mouse inner ear cell lines demonstrate a role for chemokines in promoting the growth of developing statoacoustic <e>ganglion</e> neurons.The target-derived factors necessary for promoting initial outgrowth from the statoacoustic ganglion (SAG) to the inner ear have not been fully characterized. In the present study, conditioned medium from embryonic Immortomouse inner ear cell lines that maintain many characteristics of developing inner ear sensory epithelia were screened for neurite-promoting activity. Conditioned medium found to be positive for promoting SAG neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival was then tested for the presence of chemokines, molecules that have not previously been investigated for promoting SAG outgrowth. One candidate molecule, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), was detected in the conditioned medium and subsequently localized to mouse hair cells by immunocytochemistry. In vitro studies demonstrated that function-blocking MCP-1 antibodies decreased the amount of SAG neurite outgrowth induced by the conditioned medium and that subsequent addition of MCP-1 protein was able to promote outgrowth when added to the antibody-treated conditioned medium. The use of the Immortomouse cell lines proved valuable in identifying this candidate cofactor that promotes outgrowth of early-stage SAG nerve fibers and is expressed in embryonic hair cells.",M1
16175534,"Structural organization and expression analysis of the cDNA encoding allatotropin in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera.The cDNA encoding allatotropin (AT), which stimulates juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis by the adult corpora allata (CA) of Lepidoptera, was cloned from Helicoverpa armigera (Har). Har-AT cDNA encodes a 135-amino acid polypeptide precursor containing a 13-amino acid AT sequence identical to Manduca sexta AT (Mas-AT). Three other H. armigera AT cDNAs encoding 172, 213, and 246 amino acids were also cloned. The four isoforms were produced by alternative splicing and termed Har-AT1, -AT2, -AT3, and -AT4, respectively. The basic organization of the Har-AT1 polypeptide precursor is similar to that of known ATs from other Lepidoptera with 80-97% identity at amino acid level. From the processing of the polypeptide precursor, three AT-like peptides named Har-ATL-I, -II, and -III were predicted. However, functions of the three AT-like peptides remain to be further elucidated. The evidence of Northern blots showed that a 0.7-kb Har-AT1 transcript is present in the brain and 0.7-kb Har-AT1 and 1.0-kb Har-AT4 transcripts are present in the abdominal <e>ganglion</e> (AG). Using quantitative RT-PCR, Har-AT mRNAs were detectable at much lower levels in other neural tissues, such as suboesophageal ganglion (SG) and thoracic ganglion (TG), but not in non-neural tissue, such as the epidermis, midgut, and fat body. We investigated the spatial and temporal expression of Har-AT gene in the central nervous system, and showed that expression patterns of four isoforms are distinct from each other. The results from immunocytochemistry showed that Har-AT transcript is located in the central nervous system, mainly in the brain and terminal abdominal ganglion (TAG). Thus, the AT gene products, besides affecting JH biosynthesis, might have broad influence on many biological processes in H. armigera.",M1
16107307,"Biotinidase reveals the morphogenetic sequence in cochlea and cochlear nucleus of mice.Hearing loss affects children with biotinidase deficiency, an inherited metabolic disorder in the recycling of biotin. The deficit appears shortly after birth during development of the auditory system. Using a mouse model, we sought to discover where and when biotinidase is expressed in the normal development of the cochlea and cochlear nucleus. In the process, we reconstructed the normal morphogenetic sequences of the constituent cells. Immunolabeling for biotinidase was localized to neurons and other cells of the adult and immature mouse, including the embryonic precursors of these regions dating from the stage of the otocyst. Its distribution was compared to the particular morphological changes occurring at each developmental stage. Biotinidase was localized in cells and their processes at the critical stages in their proliferation, migration, structural differentiation, and innervation, covering the entire span of their development. The prevalence of immunostaining peaked in the adult animal, including hair cells and <e>ganglion</e> cells of the cochlea and neurons of the cochlear nucleus. The findings suggest that biotinidase plays a role in the normal development of the auditory system. Besides the pattern of localization of biotinidase, this study provides the first systematic account of each developmental stage in a mammalian auditory system.",M1
16106220,"Accumulation of prion protein in the peripheral nervous system in human prion diseases.After the finding that anti-prion antibodies stain sensory and sympathetic ganglia in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), it was suggested that this localization supported the oral route of entry. However, prion accumulation subsequently also appeared in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in sporadic cases. This study aims at evaluating the extent of prion protein accumulation in the PNS in all clinicopathologic subgroups of the disorder, with the exception of the familial and sporadic forms of fatal insomnia. Patients included 2 vCJD cases, 2 Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker (GSS), 2 iatrogenic (iCJD), and 16 sporadic CJD (sCJD) cases. Gasserian (17) and spinal (9), celiac (2) and thoracic sympathetic (one) ganglia, spinal cord and medulla of one vCJD, 2 GSS, one iCJD, and 5 sCJD cases were examined. Immunostained sensory ganglia were seen in both vCJD, both iCJD, one GSS, and 10 sCJD cases; the celiac <e>ganglion</e> was positive in one of two sCJD cases, and the spinal dorsal horn and the medullary sensory nuclei were positive in one patient with vCJD, one with iCJD, and 3 with sCJD. Western blot demonstrated presence of PrP in the gasserian ganglion of one patient with sCJD. Accumulation of prion in ganglia (including autonomic) of the PNS, shared by all subgroups of spongiform encephalopathy, and in the dorsal horns and medullary sensory nuclei, shows that the sensory route is involved in the trafficking of this protein.",M1
16105661,"Acetylcholine stimulates cyclic ADP-ribose formation via M1 muscarinic receptors in rat superior cervical <e>ganglion</e>.The role of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) as the downstream signal of neuronal muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and the enzyme responsible for its synthesis, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, were examined in the rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG). Application of acetylcholine or other mAChR agonists increased the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity by about 250-300% in crude membrane fractions from the SCG of 14-day-old rats. This effect was inhibited by atropine or by the M1-mAChR antagonist, pirenzepine, and was mimicked by GTP. These results indicate that the M1 mAChRs couple to the membrane-bound form of ADP-ribosyl cyclase and suggest that cADPR is a second messenger of M1 mAChR signaling in nervous tissue.",M1
16006795,"Immunohistochemical studies of pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction: bcl2, a valuable biomarker to detect immature enteric <e>ganglion</e> cells.To identify the diagnostic pitfalls as well as the value of immunohistochemical studies in making a pathologic evaluation of a pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction (IPO), this study reassessed the pathology of 87 surgically resected intestines from 80 patients under the impression of IPO and 10 normal controls using immunohistochemical studies. The main diagnostic pitfall was the interpretation of the enteric nervous plexuses in the transitional zone and the detection of the indistinct or immature neurons indistinguishable from enteric glial cells or satellite cells. Immunohistochemical study was a very helpful diagnostic adjunct to delineating the immature neurons (bcl2), the size of the enteric ganglia and neuromuscular innervation (S-100 protein, synaptophysin, and CD56), and the interstitial cell of Cajal (c-Kit) and myopathy (SMA). With help of immunohistochemistry, our series of IPO could classify as neuropathy (92.5%), myopathy (2.5%), and the idiopathic forms (3.8%) more clearly. In terms of the types of neuropathy, Hirschsprung's disease (HD), pure hypoganglionosis, and intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND-B) were diagnosed in 71.3%, 6.3%, and 48.8% of patients, respectively. IND-B was associated with other neuropathies, HD in 77.0% and hypoganglionosis in 7.7%, rather than being present in a pure form. Immature ganglion cells were found in 48.8%. Because a reduced number of interstitial cells of Cajal was commonly associated with HD in 84.2%, hypoganglionosis in 40%, and IND-B in 76.9% of cases, it might be a preceding or aggravating factor related to an IPO. In terms of detecting immature ganglion cells, we found bcl2 most helpful.",M1
15905074,"BMP signaling is necessary for neural crest cell migration and <e>ganglion</e> formation in the enteric nervous system.The enteric nervous system (ENS) is derived from neural crest cells that migrate along the gastrointestinal tract to form a network of neurons and glia that are essential for regulating intestinal motility. Despite the number of genes known to play essential roles in ENS development, the molecular etiology of congenital disorders affecting this process remains largely unknown. To determine the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in ENS development, we first examined the expression of bmp2, bmp4, and bmprII during hindgut development and find these strongly expressed in the ENS. Moreover, functional BMP signaling, demonstrated by the expression of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8, is present in the enteric ganglia. Inhibition of BMP activity by noggin misexpression within the developing gut, both in ovo and in vitro, inhibits normal migration of enteric neural crest cells. BMP inhibition also leads to hypoganglionosis and failure of enteric ganglion formation, with crest cells unable to cluster into aggregates. Abnormalities of migration and ganglion formation are the hallmarks of two human intestinal disorders, Hirschsprung's disease and intestinal neuronal dysplasia. Our results support an essential role for BMP signaling in these aspects of ENS development and provide a basis for further investigation of these proteins in the etiology of neuro-intestinal disorders.",M1
15893938,"Neuronal models for studying lipid metabolism and transport.New methods have been developed for studying lipid metabolism and transport in primary cultures of neurons. Sympathetic neurons from rats and mice, as well as retinal <e>ganglion</e> neurons from rats, can be cultured in three-compartmented culture dishes in which the cell bodies reside in a compartment separate from that housing the distal axons. In addition, the three compartments contain completely independent fluid environments. Consequently, these neuronal cultures represent an excellent model for studying the intra-neuronal transport of lipids and proteins between cell bodies and distal axons. In addition, compartmented neuron cultures are particularly appropriate for investigating factors that regulate axonal growth and neuronal survival. The application of the compartmented culture model for use with murine neurons has opened up many new possibilities for studying lipid metabolism in neurons derived from genetically modified mice. Examples are given in which compartmented cultures of primary neurons have been used in studies on (i) lipid analysis of distal axons and cell bodies/proximal axons, (ii) immunoblotting of neuronal proteins involved in lipid metabolism, (iii) the compartmentalization of lipid metabolism, (iv) the role of lipids in axonal growth and survival, and (v) intracellular lipid transport.",M1
15882802,"Preliminary analysis of the GABA-induced current in cultured CNS neurons of the cutworm moth, Spodoptera litura.Properties of GABA-induced current in cultured CNS (<e>ganglion</e>) neurons of cutworm moths (Spodoptera litura) were studied using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. CNS neurons ranging from 10 to 20 microm in diameter were cultured for 4-7 days in MGM-464 medium. GABA-induced a current response in these neurons in a sigmoidally dose dependent manner where the Hill coefficient and EC50 were 2.2 and 33.0 microM, respectively. The reversal potential of GABA-induced current was -2.5 mV, which is close to the Cl- equilibrium potential that was calculated from chloride ion concentrations in the present experimental environment. Furthermore, the GABA-induced current response depended on the extracellular chloride ion concentration, indicating that the receptor regulates the Cl- permeability of cells. The GABA-induced current was completely inhibited by the GABA(A) antagonist, SR95531, and activated by the GABA(A) agonist, muscimol but not by the GABA(B) agonist, baclofen. On the other hand, the GABA(C) agonist, CACA, also induced a little smaller current than the GABA-induced response. The pharmacological behaviors of the GABA-induced currents suggest that these cells contain GABA receptors that belong to the GABA receptor family including the Rdl GABA receptors identified in Drosophila neurons.",M1
15882586,"A gene network downstream of transcription factor Math5 regulates retinal progenitor cell competence and <e>ganglion</e> cell fate.Math5, a mouse homolog of the Drosophila proneural bHLH transcription factor Atonal, is essential in the developing retina to establish retinal progenitor cell competence for a ganglion cell fate. Elucidating the mechanisms by which Math5 influences progenitor cell competence is crucial for understanding how specification of neuronal cell fate occurs in the retina and it requires knowledge of the downstream target genes that depend on Math5 for their expression. To date, only a handful of genes downstream of Math5 have been identified. To better define the gene network operating downstream of Math5, we used custom-designed microarrays to examine the changes in embryonic retinal gene expression caused by deletion of math5. We identified 270 Math5-dependent genes, including those that were expressed specifically either in progenitor cells or differentiated ganglion cells. The ganglion cell-specific genes included both Brn3b-dependent and Brn3b-independent genes, indicating that Math5 regulates distinct branches of the gene network responsible for retinal ganglion cell differentiation. In math5-null progenitor cells, there was an up-regulation of the proneural genes math3, neuroD, and ngn2, indicating that Math5 suppresses the production of other cell types in addition to promoting retinal ganglion cell formation. The promoter regions of many Math5-dependent genes contained binding sites for REST/NRSF, suggesting that release from general repression in retinal progenitor cells is required for ganglion cell-specific gene activation. The identification of multiple roles for Math5 provides new insights into the gene network that defines progenitor cell competence in the embryonic retina.",M1
15874894,"In vivo and in vitro L-DOPA and reticuline exposure increases ganglionic morphine levels.BACKGROUND: Given the presence of morphine, its metabolites and precursors, i.e., reticuline, in mammalian and invertebrate tissues, it has become imperative to determine if exposing tissues to putative opiate alkaloid and dopamine precursors would result in increasing endogenous morphine levels. MATERIAL/METHODS: Endogenous morphine levels were determined by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection and radioimmunoassay, following incubation of Mytilus edulis pedal ganglia with reticuline or L-DOPA. Injection of L-DOPA or reticuline into healthy animals was via the foot. RESULTS: Ganglia incubated in vitro with reticuline or L-DOPA for 1 hour exhibited a concentration and time dependent statistically significant increase in their endogenous morphine levels (5.0 +/- 0.47, 3.6 +/- 0.45 ng/<e>ganglion</e>, respectively). Injection of intact, healthy animals with reticuline or L-DOPA also results in significantly higher endogenous ganglionic morphine levels. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we show that L-DOPA is being converted to morphine, demonstrating that pedal ganglia can synthesize morphine from these putative precursors in vitro and in vivo. This is the first demonstration of morphine being synthesized in a normal, healthy free living animal.",M1
15846056,"Organization of the sensory and motor nuclei of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves in lampreys.Anterograde and retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase was used to examine the afferent and efferent projections of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves in the lamprey, Lampetra japonica. Except for the <e>ganglion</e> cells and motoneurons, the distribution patterns of HRP-positive elements differed little between the two nerves. Afferent fibers mainly terminated in the ipsilateral cerebellar area, medial octavolateralis nucleus, and between the ventral octavolateralis nucleus and descending tract and nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (dV). In the cerebellar area, most of the labeled fibers were located in the molecular zone, but some penetrated into the granular zone. In the rostral part of the medial octavolateralis nucleus, labeled fibers coursed from the middle to the lateral area, and in the caudal part, they were localized in the dorsal area of the nucleus. In the area between the dV and ventral octavolateralis nucleus, labeled fibers coursed near the dorsal margin of the rostral part of the dV, and in the caudal part, they shifted dorsally. Ganglion cells and motoneurons of each nerve were also labeled.",M1
15626507,"Immunocytochemical analysis of putative allatostatin receptor (DAR-2) distribution in the CNS of larval Drosophila melanogaster.Allatostatins (ASTs) are a family of neuropeptides that inhibit the biosynthesis of juvenile hormone in cockroaches and related insects, but not in flies. Two receptors for allatostatins, DAR-1 and DAR-2, with sequence similarity to mammalian galanin receptors have previously been cloned in Drosophila melanogaster. To study the distribution of the predicted DAR-2 protein by immunocytochemistry, antisera were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to part of the amino terminus of the receptor sequence. In the brain of larval Drosophila, immunoreactivity appeared to be associated with glial septa surrounding neuropil compartments. In the ventral <e>ganglion</e>, immunoreactive cell bodies appeared to reside in the cortex of the ganglion, surrounding the central neuropil and neurohemal organs. In addition, double labeling immunocytochemistry revealed a substantial superposition between distribution of AST-like immunoreactivity and the putative DAR-2 protein in at least five cell bodies in the region of the ring gland corresponding to the corpora cardiaca.",M1
15626500,"Neuropeptides associated with the frontal <e>ganglion</e> of larval Lepidoptera.The occurrence of neuropeptides in the frontal ganglia of larvae of the tobacco hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, the tomato moth, Lacanobia oleracea and the cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis was investigated using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Only three types of peptides could be identified or assigned from frontal ganglion extracts; M. sexta allatostatin (Manse-AS), M. sexta allatotropin (Manse-AT), and F/YXFGL-NH2 allatostatins. The peptide profiles of frontal ganglion of L. oleracea and S. littoralis were similar, with ten identical [M+H]+ ions, seven of which could be assigned to known lepidopteran peptides (Manse-AT, cydiastatin 2, 3, 4 and helicostatin 1, 5, 9). In addition, mass ions corresponding to helicostatin 7 (which was confirmed by MALDI-post source decay analysis) and Manse-AS were present in frontal ganglia of L. oleracea and helicostatin 6 in frontal ganglia of S. littoralis. Only four mass ions from M. sexta frontal ganglia corresponded to known peptides, cydiastatin 3 and 4, helicostatin 1, and Manse-AT. The only difference between the profiles of frontal ganglia from different stages of L. oleracea were mass ions which could not be assigned, and no differences were observed in the allatoregulatory peptides present. In HPLC fractions of M. sexta frontal ganglia, F/YXFGL-NH2 allatostatin-like immunoreactivity was widespread suggesting that more allatostatins were present than were identified.",M1
15599740,"Role of <e>ganglion</e> cells in sigmoid volvulus.The aim of this study was to clarify the role of ganglion cells in the development and recurrence of sigmoid volvulus. We analyzed 9 samples obtained from 9 patients who had undergone sigmoidectomy for sigmoid volvulus, and, for comparison, 18 samples from 18 patients who had undergone sigmoidectomy or low anterior resection for rectal cancer. Neuron-specific enolase was used for immunohistochemical staining to detect ganglion cells, and the number of ganglion cells in 20 contiguous fields was counted at 200? magnification. The average number of ganglion cells per 1000 cm(3) was corrected using the ratio of the circumference of the resected sigmoid colon to the average circumference in the control group. The raw numbers of ganglion cells in the Meissner's and Auerbach's plexuses in the volvulus group were significantly lower than those in the non-volvulus group (Meissner: p = 0.017, Auerbach: p = 0.007). The circumference of the resected sigmoid colons with volvulus was greater than that of those without volvulus (p = 0.00013). There was no significant difference in the corrected numbers of ganglion cells in the Meissner's plexus or Auerbach's plexus per 1000 cm(3) between the volvulus and non-volvulus groups (Meissner: p = 0.410, Auerbach: p = 0.890).Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the corrected numbers of ganglion cells between the revolvulus and non-revolvulus groups. These findings led us to conclude that functional disorder of bowel movement or elongation of the bowel in sigmoid volvulus or revolvulus is not related to the number of ganglion cells in Auerbach's or Meissner's plexus.",M1
15570429,"Regional differences in nitrergic neuronal density in the developing porcine urinary bladder.Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in normal bladder physiology by regulating local arteriolar tone and smooth muscle relaxation and modulating the production of extracellular matrix proteins in vitro. Little information is available regarding the nitrergic innervation of the bladder during development. In this study we investigated the changes in density and morphology of the intramural nitrergic neurons of the porcine urinary bladder during development using whole-mount preparation. Bladder specimens were obtained from porcine foetuses of gestational age 60 days (n=5) and 90 days (n=5) and from newborn piglets (n=5) after perfusion fixation. Bladders were divided into base, body, and dome. Whole-mount preparation using NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry was used to visualize nitrergic innervation of the urinary bladders and to measure density of NADPH-positive ganglia (including single neurons), number of NADPH-d positive neurons per <e>ganglion</e>, and size of individual neurons. One-way ANOVA and chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis with a p-value &lt;0.05 considered statistically significant. NADPH-d positive ganglia were numerous in the muscular layer of all three age groups. At E60, ganglion density was significantly higher in the body (mean 880/cm(2)) than in the dome (397/cm(2)) or the base (676/cm(2)). The ganglion density significantly decreased with age. The number of NADPH-d positive neurons per ganglion increased significantly between E90 and birth (p&lt;0.01). A marked increase in the size of individual neurons over time was also seen (p&lt;0.001), predominantly due to an increase in cytoplasm. Our data on whole-mount preparations demonstrate that significant maturation in nitrergic neuronal density and morphology occurs in the porcine urinary bladder, at least until birth.",M1
15508521,"Identification of hydroxyapatite deposits in the smooth muscle cells and <e>ganglion</e> cells of autopsied small intestines.We have studied the deposition of calcium salts in the autopsied intestines which have not been described previously as far as we were able to determine. In order to clarify the incidence, predisposing conditions, mineral compositions of the deposited materials and clinical significance of this phenomenon, we examined 76 cases of consecutive autopsied small intestines by von Kossa's staining. Deposited calcium salts were further examined by electron microscopically, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope and electron diffraction analysis. Deposition of calcium salts was observed in the small intestines of 13 cases. Among them, 10 cases were accompanied by hypercalcemia. Deposition of calcium salts was mainly observed in smooth muscle cells of the proper muscle layers and ganglion cells of the Auerbach's myenteric plexus. Intestinal calcinosis was frequently accompanied by deposition of calcium salts in the proper muscle layers of esophagus and large intestine, renal tubules and cardiac myocardial cells. Electron microscopically, the calcium salts were identified as needle-shaped crystals and located on the surface of the extracellular-collagen bundles, in the cytoplasm, mitochondria and nucleus of the smooth muscles cells. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope and electron diffraction analysis suggested the deposited calcium salts as hydroxyapatite. Two patients among the six cases with moderate to severe calcium deposition showed clinical manifestation of paralytic ileus. In conclusion, intestinal calcinosis was frequently observed mostly associated with hypercalcemia. Calcium salts of hydroxyapatite were deposited to the smooth muscle cells and the Auerbach's myenteric plexus of the muscular layer. Deposition of calcium salts might occasionally causes the paralytic ileus but clinical significance of this lesion requires further examination.",M1
15496442,"Eya1 and Six1 are essential for early steps of sensory neurogenesis in mammalian cranial placodes.Eya1 encodes a transcriptional co-activator and is expressed in cranial sensory placodes. It interacts with and functions upstream of the homeobox gene Six1 during otic placodal development. Here, we have examined their role in cranial sensory neurogenesis. Our data show that the initial cell fate determination for the vestibuloacoustic neurons and their delamination appeared to be unaffected in the absence of Eya1 or Six1 as judged by the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix genes, Neurog1 that specifies the neuroblast cell lineage, and Neurod that controls neuronal differentiation and survival. However, both genes are necessary for normal maintenance of neurogenesis. During the development of epibranchial placode-derived distal cranial sensory ganglia, while the phenotype appears less severe in Six1 than in Eya1 mutants, an early arrest of neurogenesis was observed in the mutants. The mutant epibranchial progenitor cells fail to express Neurog2 that is required for the determination of neuronal precursors, and other basic helix-loop-helix as well as the paired homeobox Phox2 genes that are essential for neural differentiation and maintenance. Failure to activate their normal differentiation program resulted in abnormal apoptosis of the progenitor cells. Furthermore, we show that disruption of viable <e>ganglion</e> formation leads to pathfinding errors of branchial motoneurons. Finally, our results suggest that the Eya-Six regulatory hierarchy also operates in the epibranchial placodal development. These findings uncover an essential function for Eya1 and Six1 as critical determination factors in acquiring both neuronal fate and neuronal subtype identity from epibranchial placodal progenitors. These analyses define a specific role for both genes in early differentiation and survival of the placodally derived cranial sensory neurons.",M1
15485888,"Tachykinin and tachykinin receptor of an ascidian, Ciona intestinalis: evolutionary origin of the vertebrate tachykinin family.Tachykinins (TKs) are the most prevalent vertebrate brain/gut peptides. In this study, we originally identified authentic TKs and their receptor from a protochordate, Ciona intestinalis. The Ciona TK (Ci-TK) precursor, like mammalian gamma-preprotachykinin A (gamma-PPTA), encodes two TKs, Ci-TK-I and -II, including the -FXGLM-NH(2) vertebrate TK consensus. Mass spectrometry of the neural extract revealed the production of both Ci-TKs. Ci-TK-I contains several Substance P (SP)-typical amino acids, whereas a Thr is exceptionally located at position 4 from the C terminus of Ci-TK-II. The Ci-TK gene encodes both Ci-TKs in the same exon, indicating no alternative generation of Ci-TKs, unlike the PPTA gene. These results suggested that the alternative splicing of the PPTA gene was established during evolution of vertebrates. The only Ci-TK receptor, Ci-TK-R, was equivalently activated by Ci-TK-I, SP, and neurokinin A at physiological concentrations, whereas Ci-TK-II showed 100-fold less potent activity, indicating that the ligand selectivity of Ci-TK-R is distinct from those of vertebrate TK receptors. Ci-TK-I, like SP, also elicited the typical contraction on the guinea pig ileum. The Ci-TK gene was expressed in neurons of the brain <e>ganglion</e>, small cells in the intestine, and the zone 7 in the endostyle, which corresponds to the vertebrate thyroid gland. Furthermore, the Ci-TK-R mRNA was distributed in these three tissues plus the gonad. These results showed that Ci-TKs play major roles in sexual behavior and feeding in protochordates as brain/gut peptides and endocrine/paracrine molecules. Taken together, our data revealed the biochemical and structural origins of vertebrate TKs and their receptors.",M1
15471113,"Intestinal neuronal disorders--a study of seven cases.Intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) has been reported as an innervation disorder that can present as isolated disease or may be associated with Hirschsprung's disease (HD). The interest in this disorder is growing as it mimics HD at clinical level but can be managed with a more conservative approach if an accurate diagnosis can be made. Many workers have tried to set up diagnostic criteria of this condition. But the importance of one criterion varied from one study to another. In our study we analysed seven cases of suspected innervation disorder that had undergone resection. A detailed histological study on these cases was performed and four of them were found to fulfill the diagnostic criteria of IND laid down by Kobayashi and his co-workers. These patients had hyperganglionosis, giant ganglia and ectopic <e>ganglion</e> cells in the lamina propria.

Four groups were employed: SI--ileum control; CBI--denervated ileum; SC--colon control; and CBC--denervated colon. We used the Myosin-V immunohistochemistry technique to study the myenteric and submucous plexuses. In the submucous plexus of the ileum and colon there was not a significant decrease in the number of neurons/mm2 and of ganglia/mm2. The denervation of the myenteric plexus in the group CBI was 44.7% and in the group CBC, 68.3%. In the myenteric plexus there was also a significant decrease in the number of ganglia/mm2 (13.8% in group CBI and 52.14% in group CBC) and in the number of neurons/<e>ganglion</e> (33.9% in group CBI and 39.6% in group CBC). The morphological analyses showed that there was an alteration in the shape of the ganglia of the ileal and colonic myenteric plexus. The area of the cell bodies had a significant increase both in the myenteric and the submucous plexus in groups CBI and CBC. These data demonstrate that the BAC treatment causes morphologic and quantitative changes in the myenteric plexus and quantitative changes in the cell body area of the submucous plexus.",M1

Cell cross-sectional area, activities of cholinesterase (demonstrated with thioacetic acid method) monoamine oxidase (demonstrated with Glenner method) were measured in neurocytes of stellate, spinal, trigeminal and gastric ganglia in rats aged 2 to 360 days. Measurements were made with the help of  Bioscan  videoanalyzer. Informational analysis was used for the evaluation of the degree of maturation of neurocyte systems. General features, age- and organ-related peculiarities of morphometric and enzyme-histochemical characteristics were established for neurocytes of different ganglia, as well as a heterochronism of their definitive state attainment. The time of stabilization for neurocytes of stellate and I thoracic spinal ganglia was the age of 60 days, for those of trigeminal <e>ganglion</e> and intramural gastric ganglia -90 and 120 days, respectively. By this time, neurocyte systems turned from a determined state into a probabilistic-determined one, this transformation being considered as a population stabilization.",M1
15354077,"Choroidal <e>ganglion</e> cell changes in human glaucomatous eyes.PURPOSE: Choroidal ganglion cells (CGC) are an important source of vasodilative innervation of the posterior ciliary arteries, which also supplies the lamina cribrosa region of the optic nerve. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether CGC undergo quantitative and morphologic changes in human glaucomatous eyes. METHODS: Twenty-five human glaucomatous eyes (15 with primary open angle glaucoma, 10 with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma) and 38 normal eyes (31 age-matched) were investigated. Scleral and choroidal whole mounts were stained for NADPH diaphorase, the CGC quantified in the outer and inner choroid and in the different quadrants separately, and the diameter of the CGC measured. Serial semi- and ultrathin sections were studied by light and electron microscopy. RESULTS: In glaucomatous eyes, the total number of CGC was significantly decreased. The most striking loss of CGC was found in the temporal quadrant adjacent to the optic nerve, where only single CGC persisted. The remaining CGC showed a normal ultrastructural appearance but a shift toward larger cells. CONCLUSION: Smaller CGC and those directly adjacent to the optic nerve seem to be most susceptible to the yet unknown pathogenetic factors responsible for this CGC loss. Since the most pronounced loss of CGC occurred in the vicinity of the optic nerve it is tempting to speculate that the vasodilative regulation of the vessels supplying the lamina cribrosa region is impaired in eyes with POAG.",M1

Intraosseous ganglia located in the scaphoid have rarely been described in the literature. We report the case of a 30-year-old right-handed woman who presented with a more than 24-month history of progressive right-wrist pain. No history of trauma was reported.Conservative treatment with anti-inflammatory medications before referral was unsuccessful. Examination revealed a small palpable mass in the carpal navicular region with no limitation of normal wrist motion. An IOG cyst of the scaphoid was found on standard radiograph and CT-scan of the wrist. Treatment consisted in curettage of the cyst followed by packing of the defect with autologous cancellous bone graft harvested in the distal end of the radial metaphysis. Satisfactory functional recovery was achieved. The clinical, radiographic and therapeutic aspects of this rare condition are discussed by the authors.",M2

20135973,"[An improved surgical strategy and treatment outcome of dorsal wrist <e>ganglion</e>]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcome of treating dorsal wrist ganglion with an improved surgical strategy by excising the ganglion completely along their stalk and repairing the dorsal carpal ligaments under brachial anesthesia. METHODS: From March 2005 to January 2007, 34 patients with dorsal wrist ganglion were treated and studied retrospectively. There were 14 males and 20 females, aged 25-65 years (43 years on average). The left sides were involved in 22 cases and right sides in 12 cases. Thirteen cases of relapse received excision for 1 to 4 times under local anesthesia, with a mean period of 17 months (14 days to 7 years) from excision to recurrence. Twenty-one patients were first attack cases with a mean period of 11 months (15 days to 8 years) from diagnosis to excision. The size of the ganglion ranged from 1.5 cm x 1.2 cm to 4.5 cm x 4.0 cm. Now, each surgical process was performed under brachial anesthesia, and a pneumathode tourniquet was used. In 6 patients, the stalks of ganglion did not invade the carpal ligaments, and ganglion was removed completely without immobilization after operation. In 28 patients, the stalks of ganglion invaded the carpal ligaments, ganglion was excised completely along its stalk to the dorsal carpal structure; the ligaments were sutured directly in 16 cases and were repaired with adjacent tissue such as the wall of sheathing canal of extensor tendon in 12 cases. The wrists were immobilised for 3 weeks. RESULTS: Primary wound healing was achieved in all incisions. All patients were followed up for 26-36 months with an average of 31.5 months. Only 2 cases (5.9%) recurred. The range of motion of the wrist remained normal and the symptom of the dorsal wrist was relieved slightly. Patients' satisfaction score ranged from 60 to 100, with an average of 83.8. CONCLUSION: The ganglion should be excised completely together with defect repair of dorsal carpal ligament under brachial anesthesia and the wrist immobilised for 3 weeks, the recurrence rate will be reduced greatly.",M2

As in other locations, these cysts are believed to communicate with neighboring joints. The positive diagnosis and preoperative work-up of these cysts require identification and location of the cyst pedicles so that they may be excised and the risk of recurrence decreased. This can be challenging with ultrasonography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. We present three cases of symptomatic ganglion cysts of the tarsal tunnel, diagnosed by MR imaging, where computed tomography (CT) arthrography with delayed acquisitions helped to confirm the diagnosis and identify precisely the topography of the communication with the subtalar joint.

20043771,"Evidence that atypical juxtafacet cysts are joint derived.OBJECT: Juxtafacet cysts (JFCs) in usual locations have recently been shown to have joint connections. The pathogenesis of JFCs in unusual locations has remained obscure. The authors hypothesize that all JFCs, including atypical ones, are joint derived. METHODS: In this study the authors sought to explain the occurrence and formation of clinical outliers of spinal JFCs. In Part I, they performed an extensive literature search to identify case reports of spinal intraneural cysts that have been unappreciated despite the fact that they should occur. In Part II, they studied far-lateral (extraforaminal) cysts treated at their institution and reported in the literature. The presence of a joint connection was specifically looked for since this finding has not been widely appreciated. RESULTS: In Part I, 3 isolated case reports of spinal intraneural JFCs without reported joint connections were identified: 2 involving L-5 and 1, C-8. In Part II, 6 cases involving patients with far-lateral JFCs treated at the authors' institution were reviewed and all 6 had joint connections. Two of these cases had been previously published, although their joint connections were not appreciated. In 2 of the newly reported cases, arthrography confirmed a communication between the facet and the cyst. Only 1 of 5 cases in the literature had a recognized joint connection. CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe that all JFCs are joint derived. This explanation for intraneural and extraneural JFCs in typical locations would be consistent with the unified articular (synovial) theory and the pathogenesis for intraneural and extraneural <e>ganglion</e> cyst formation in the limbs. Facet joints appear no different from other synovial joints occurring elsewhere.

20033372,"Immunohistochemical and electron microscopic studies of a case of duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma.Gangliocytic paraganglioma (GPG) is a rare tumor, occurring almost exclusively in the duodenum. In the present case, a submucosal tumor 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in size was located on the anal side of the papilla of Vater, with clear margins and without capsule on cut-surface examination. Tumor cells included three types of cells: <e>ganglion</e>-like cells (GCs), endocrine cells (ECs), and Schwann cells (SCs). The GCs were large with eccentric nuclei with large nucleoli and clear abundant cytoplasm. ECs were detected in small nests, surrounded by bundles of SCs. Immunohistochemically, GCs were positive for synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and CD56. ECs were positive for chromogranin A, NSE, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, and CD56, and were associated with S100 protein-positive SCs. On fine structural examination, ECs contained numerous membrane-bounded secretory granules, 250-450 nm in diameter, in their cytoplasm, surrounded by a branched, complex basal lamina. SCs possessed basal lamina along their long interlacing cytoplasmic processes. The histogenesis of GPG most likely involves proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells in the duodenal crypts in the duodenum as a true tumor, although it is also possible that the retroperitoneal components of both GCs and SCs proliferate, together with ECs, from ventral primordial tissue of the pancreas in the duodenum. The immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings of a case of GPG are reported, focusing on three major cellular components: GCs, ECs, and SCs.",M2

For this purpose the tissues were fixed in formalin (10%) solution, cut serially in 7micro and 10micro slabs. Volume density of the respiratory system was assessed stereometricaly using Universal testing system Weibel M 42. We observed that volume density of epithelia, musculature and glands were proportionally present in the tracheal tissue. Cellular interstitial tissue is consistently increasing and corresponds to the developmental stages of the newborn babies. The density of tracheal ganglions is greater in premature ages of immature and premature newborns (p&lt;0,05). Decreased number of ganglion cells is observed in mature ages (p&lt;0,05). This is caused by intensive ramification of ganglions from serosa to deeper layers of trachea right to epithelium.

We show here that CLP36 is expressed in sensory ganglia but not in the CNS of adult rats. In primary dorsal root <e>ganglion</e> (DRG) neurons, CLP36 is distributed in the soma and neurites with enrichment in the growth cones. CLP36 forms a complex with alpha-actinin and is localized to actin cytoskeleton. To examine the role of CLP36 in neuronal cells, we transfected PC12 cells with a series of CLP36 deletion mutants and found that over-expression of CLP36 PDZ domain affects neurite outgrowth. Reduction of CLP36 function in PC12 cells by RNA interference (RNAi) induced lamellipodial protrusions around cell periphery and activated growth-cone movements, resulting in an increase in the length and number of neurites. Similarly, inhibition of CLP36 in primary DRG neurons increased the rate of neurite-bearing cells. We also found that CLP36 is up-regulated in DRG neurons and facial motoneurons after nerve injury. These findings suggest that CLP36 serves as a scaffold to form a multiprotein complex that regulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics and plays a role in controlling neurite outgrowth.",M2

Small-magnet, lower-extremity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequent arthroscopy missed the lesion. On MRI with gadolinium contrast, the lesion was defined but misdiagnosed as a suprapatellar pouch ganglion cyst. Following resection of the 6 x 5 x 1.8-cm lesion, histology confirmed a lobular benign tumor with cystic elements recognized in the pathology and radiology literature as juxta-articular myxoma. Such lesions are characteristically multilobulated and contained within a capsular rim that enhances with gadolinium venous contrast. Otherwise, they appear hyperintense to fat on T2-weighted images and hypointense to muscle on T1-weighted images. This is an uncommonly encountered but known cystic lesion around the knee that is most often confused with ganglion cyst, synovial lipoma, lipoma arborescens, or pigmented or non-pigmented villonodular synovitis. Given its more cellular nature and thicker encapsulation, it should be able to be differentiated from ganglion cyst on MRI with a high index of suspicion, and should be recognized because of its high rate of recurrence. Unusual in this case was its location within the suprapatellar pouch, demonstrating the ease with which such lesions can be missed arthroscopically despite significant mass.",M2

METHODS: Five patients with 6 intraneural ganglia are presented. Four patients presented with symptomatic intraneural ganglia in the buttock and pelvis affecting the sciatic and lumbosacral plexus elements. An asymptomatic cyst affecting the opposite sciatic nerve was found on MR imaging in 1 patient.

RESULTS: All 5 intraneural ganglia affecting the sciatic and lumbosacral plexus elements were found to have a joint connection to the posteromedial aspect of the hip joint; the obturator intraneural cyst had a joint connection to the anteromedial aspect of the hip joint. In all cases, initial review of the MR images led to their misinterpretation. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, these are the first cases of intraneural ganglia demonstrated to have a connection to the hip joint. This finding at a rare site provides further evidence for the unifying articular (synovial) theory for the formation of intraneural ganglia and reveals a shared mechanism for their propagation.

METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 55 patients with dorsal wrist ganglion cysts who underwent arthroscopic resection with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Ten had recurrent ganglion cysts previously treated with open resection. Grip strength, wrist motion, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire scores were evaluated preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years postoperatively. Intraoperative findings were reviewed. RESULTS: In primary ganglion cysts a discrete stalk was present in 4 of 45 cases and diffuse cystic material and redundant capsular thickening were present in 38 of 45 cases. Cystic material appeared to arise from the radiocarpal joint exclusively in 11 of 42 cases, extended into the midcarpal joint in 29 of 42 cases, and arose exclusively from the midcarpal joint in 2 of 42 cases. The scapholunate joint demonstrated instability types I (2 of 45 cases), II (22 of 45 cases), III (20 of 45 cases), and IV (1 of 45 cases). The lunatotriquetral joint demonstrated instability types II (6 of 45 cases) and III (39 of 45 cases). At 6 weeks, average grip strengths increased by 5.9 kg and wrist flexion decreased 13 degrees . Preoperative Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores improved from 14.2 to 1.7 at 6 weeks and remained stable at 2 years. At 2 years, all patients demonstrated motion to within 5 degrees of preoperative measurements, and there were no recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Patients experienced significant increases in function and decreases in pain within 6 weeks after arthroscopic ganglion cyst resection, and the recurrence and complication rates appear to be comparable to open resections. Ganglion cysts also have a high association with certain interosseous laxities, and recurrent ganglion cysts originating from the midcarpal joint are not contraindications for arthroscopic resection. Assessment of the midcarpal joint is necessary for complete resection of most ganglion cysts, and identification of a discrete stalk is an uncommon finding and not necessary for successful resection.",M2

CASE: We report a new case of intraligamentous ganglion cyst of the anterior cruciate ligament treated successfully with arthroscopic aspiration followed by partial excision of the cyst wall after MRI examination. The MR findings, clinical features and arthroscopic findings were evaluated comparatively. Diagnosis was confirmed by means of histological study after arthroscopic excision. The cyst was fluid-filled, with low T1-weighted signal intensity and high T2-weighted signal intensity. Pain was the most frequent clinical sign without any history of trauma. Postarthroscopy outcome was painless. Histologic diagnosis corresponded to ganglion cyst. CONCLUSION: An intraligamentous ganglion cyst of the ACL is extremely rare and suggests some diagnostic and therapeutic particularities.",M2
19148568,"Sciatic cross-over in patients with peroneal and tibial intraneural ganglia confirmed by knee MR arthrography.BACKGROUND: A predictable mechanism and stereotypic patterns of peroneal intraneural ganglia are being defined based on careful analysis of MRIs. Peroneal and tibial intraneural ganglia extending from the superior tibiofibular joint which extend to the level of the sciatic nerve have been observed leading to the hypothesis that sciatic cross-over could exist. Such a cross-over phenomenon would allow intraneural cyst from the peroneal nerve by means of its shared epineurial sheath within the sciatic nerve to cross over to involve the tibial nerve, or vice versa from a tibial intraneural cyst to the peroneal nerve. METHOD AND FINDINGS: One patient with a peroneal intraneural <e>ganglion</e> and another with a tibial intraneural ganglion each underwent a knee MR arthrogram. These studies were not only definitive in demonstrating the communication of the cyst to the superior tibiofibular joint connection but also in confirming sciatic cross-over. Contrast injected into the knee could be demonstrated tracking to the superior tibiofibular joint and then proximally into the common peroneal or tibial nerve respectively, crossing over at the sciatic nerve, and then descending down the tibial and peroneal nerves. The arthrographic findings mirrored MR images upon their retrospective review. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides direct in vivo proof of the nature of sciatic cross-over theorized by critical review of MRIs and/or experimental dye injections done in cadavers. This study is important in clarifying the potential paths of propagation of intraneural cysts at points of major bifurcation.",M2
19110165,"Magnetic resonance imaging of a deep peroneal intraneural <e>ganglion</e> cyst originating from the second metatarsophalangeal joint: a pattern of propagation supporting the unified articular (synovial) theory for the formation of intraneural ganglia.A deep peroneal intraneural cyst of the first web space of the foot is presented. Analysis of the magnetic resonance image scans revealed not only a connection with the medial aspect of the second metatarsophalangeal joint, but also the presence of an interconnected cyst within the lateral digital branch of the hallux. These characteristic magnetic resonance image findings are consistent with those previously described for a peroneal intraneural ganglion cyst that arose from the superior tibiofibular joint, and include (1) origin (ascent) from the second metatarsophalangeal joint with propagation along the articular branch and into the dorsal digital branch of the second toe, (2) cross-over within the shared epineurial sheath of the deep peroneal nerve, and (3) further propagation (descent) within the dorsal digital branch of the hallux. The analogous features between intraneural ganglion cysts affecting small and large-caliber nerves support the fundamental principles of the unified articular (synovial) theory for the formation of intraneural ganglia, including (1) a connection to a synovial joint, (2) dissection of joint fluid through a capsular rent along the articular branch into the parent nerve, and (3) intra-epineurial, pressure-dependent propagation of cyst fluid along paths of least resistance.

19102823,"Cost minimisation using clinic-based treatment for common hand conditions--a prospective economic analysis.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to compare the cost of treatment of Dupuytren's disease, ganglia and trigger digits in the out-patient department with the operating theatre. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients seen in a new patient hand clinic with a diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease, trigger digit or <e>ganglion</e> of the wrist or hand requiring treatment were prospectively identified over a 6-month period. The numbers undergoing a procedure in the out-patient clinic or theatre were recorded. Costings of theatre time and out-patient time, as well as national tariff income, were obtained from the hospital management. RESULTS: Over the 6-month period, 80, 26, and 52 patients were treated with regard to Dupuytren's disease, ganglia and trigger digits, respectively. Of these, 37, 23, and 44 were treated by an out-patient procedure, and 43, 3 and 8 underwent a formal operation. The total cost of the out-patient procedures was calculated at pound 1560 over 6 months. To perform these as formal operations would have cost pound 64,896. The cost savings were, therefore, pound 63,336, or pound 126,672 per annum. CONCLUSIONS: Out-patient interventions for Dupuytren's disease, ganglia and trigger digits result in significant cost savings over formal surgical treatment.",M2

19066593,"High-efficiency transduction of the mouse retina by tyrosine-mutant AAV serotype vectors.Vectors derived from adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) have become important gene delivery tools for the treatment of many inherited ocular diseases in well-characterized animal models. Previous studies have determined that the viral capsid plays an essential role in the cellular tropism and efficiency of transgene expression. Recently, it was shown that phosphorylation of surface-exposed tyrosine residues from AAV2 capsid targets the viral particles for ubiquitination and proteasome- mediated degradation, and mutations of these tyrosine residues lead to highly efficient vector transduction in vitro and in vivo. Because the tyrosine residues are highly conserved in other AAV serotypes, in this study we evaluated the intraocular transduction characteristics of vectors containing point mutations in surface- exposed capsid tyrosine residues in AAV serotypes 2, 8, and 9. Several of these novel AAV mutants were found to display a strong and widespread transgene expression in many retinal cells after subretinal or intravitreal delivery compared with their wild-type counterparts. For the first time, we show efficient transduction of the <e>ganglion</e> cell layer by AAV serotype 8 or 9 mutant vectors, thus providing additional tools besides AAV2 for targeting these cells. These enhanced AAV vectors have a great potential for future therapeutic applications for retinal degenerations and ocular neovascular diseases.",M2

We report 2 separate cases of primary cutaneous ganglioneuroma, both of which are associated with prominent overlying hyperkeratosis. The first case was in a 38-year-old woman with overlying verrucous keratosis. The second case was in a 93-year-old man with epidermal changes reminiscent of a seborrheic keratosis. Histologically, both lesions were composed of a proliferation of hyperplastic nerve fibers with spindled Schwann cells and axons with intermingled <e>ganglion</e> cells. Immunohistochemistry for neurofilament highlighted nerve fascicles; S100 protein displayed the associated Schwann cells, and neuron-specific enolase stained the interspersed ganglion cells. Variation in immunohistochemical staining was present between the 2 cases. A review of the literature demonstrates variable immunohistochemical staining of ganglion and Schwann cells in prior cases. Familiarity with these findings is important in establishing a diagnosis. The significance of the associated hyperkeratosis remains speculative.",M2

For over 80 years, its original brief description by Beauchêne was wrongly attributed to Duchenne, effectively making the reference and specimen inaccessible to scrutiny. Fortunately, the intact cyst had been safely housed in the Musée Dupuytren, Paris, France, thus permitting its examination. Although originally described as a  serous  cyst, our present understanding of the anatomy of the ulnar nerve and of peripheral nerve pathology allowed us to reinterpret it as a mucin-filled, elbow-level, ulnar intraneural ganglion cyst. In addition to its description as a fusiform cystic enlargement of the nerve, we documented similar enlargement of a lumen-bearing branch, the articular branch at the level of the elbow. Based on our assessment of the specimen and with a modern perspective, we concluded that the origin of the cyst was from the postero-medial aspect of the elbow joint and that its fluid content, having dissected through a capsular defect, followed the path of the articular branch into the parent ulnar nerve. The purpose of this report is to clarify historical misconceptions regarding the pathogenesis of this controversial entity.",M2

18716098,"Ganglia of the hand and wrist: a sonographic analysis.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the sonographic appearance of a large series of pathologically proven ganglia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computer search of sonography and pathology reports for hand and wrist ganglia was performed. All sonography reports and images were reviewed for <e>ganglion</e> size, location, presence of a neck, echogenicity, acoustic enhancement, locules, color Doppler flow, margins, wall thickness, and calcifications and to determine if the ganglion was palpable or collapsed. All pathology reports were reviewed for histologic features that were then correlated with the sonographic images. Ganglia were categorized into three groups: simple, complex cystic, and solid-appearing. RESULTS: Of 60 ganglia, 34 were complex, 91% of which were located within the dorsal or volar wrist; 97% had well-defined margins; 76%, locules; 68%, acoustic enhancement; 47%, a thick wall; 15%, internal reflectors; and 12%, blood flow. Of the 23 simple ganglia, 11 involved the extensor or flexor tendon sheath, 73% of which were simple. Complex ganglia had a larger mean volume than simple. Three ganglia were solid-appearing. A visible neck was seen in 25% of ganglia. CONCLUSION: Most ganglia are complex rather than simple on sonography. Complex ganglia are larger than simple ganglia; located within the dorsal or volar wrist; and usually have well-defined margins, thick walls, locules, and acoustic enhancement. A small percentage have blood flow and internal reflectors. Simple ganglia are smaller and can occur within the volar or dorsal wrist, or flexor tendon sheath. Most flexor tendon sheath ganglia are simple rather than complex. Solid-appearing ganglia, although unusual, may mimic a benign neoplasm or synovitis.",M2

METHODS: A 17-year-old male with a 4-month history of left L5 radicular pain was found to have an intraspinal cystic lesion causing radicular compression. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic lesion located in the ventral side of the dura. The patient suffered from severe leg pain. As a result, a surgical operation was therefore performed. RESULTS: The cyst containing jelly-like components and a hemorrhage was punctured and then extirpated. It originated from the posterior longitudinal ligament. A histological study revealed the cyst to be without any synovial layers. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to describe a ganglion cyst originating from the posterior longitudinal ligament in a teenager. This possible etiology should be kept in mind for any other individuals displaying symptoms of spinal nerve root compression as well as disc herniation.",M2
18612458,"Soldier-specific modification of the mandibular motor neurons in termites.Social insects exhibit a variety of caste-specific behavioral tendencies that constitute the basis of division of labor within the colony. In termites, the soldier caste display distinctive defense behaviors, such as aggressively attacking enemies with well-developed mandibles, while the other castes retreat into the colony without exhibiting any aggressive response. It is thus likely that some form of soldier-specific neuronal modification exists in termites. In this study, the authors compared the brain (cerebral <e>ganglion</e>) and the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG) of soldiers and pseudergates (workers) in the damp-wood termite, Hodotermopsis sjostedti. The size of the SOG was significantly larger in soldiers than in pseudergates, but no difference in brain size was apparent between castes. Furthermore, mandibular nerves were thicker in soldiers than in pseudergates. Retrograde staining revealed that the somata sizes of the mandibular motor neurons (MdMNs) in soldiers were more than twice as large as those of pseudergates. The enlargement of MdMNs was also observed in individuals treated with a juvenile hormone analogue (JHA), indicating that MdMNs become enlarged in response to juvenile hormone (JH) action during soldier differentiation. This enlargement is likely to have two functions: a behavioral function in which soldier termites will be able to defend more effectively through relatively faster and stronger mandibular movements, and a developmental function that associates with the development of soldier-specific mandibular muscle morphogenesis in termite head. The soldier-specific enlargement of mandibular motor neurons was observed in all examined species in five termite families that have different mechanisms of defense, suggesting that such neuronal modification was already present in the common ancestor of termites and is significant for soldier function.",M2

OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of a subacute radiculopathy resulting from a spontaneous hemorrhage into a lumbar ganglion cyst. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Ganglion and synovial cysts of the lumbar spine are becoming more frequent, and they are generally associated with degenerative lumbar spinal disease. Few cases of hemorrhage into lumbar juxtafacet cysts after trauma or anticoagulation therapy have been described in the literature. METHODS: A case of a spontaneous hemorrhage in a lumbar ganglion cyst is presented. RESULTS: A 61-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of intermittent bilateral lumbar ache. Eight days before admission he had a sudden exacerbation of the lumbar pain and began to fall frequently and noticed weakness and tingling in his lower members, mainly in the right leg. Magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a hematic collection associated with a large juxtafacet cyst at the L4-L5 level. He was submitted to surgery and the cyst was totally removed. Microscopic examination was consistent with the diagnosis of a ganglion cyst. Two days after surgery he had already an independent gait. CONCLUSION: Although, there are a few descriptions of hemorrhagic lumbar justafacet cysts after trauma or anticoagulant therapy, this is the first case of a hemorrhagic ganglion cyst with no previous traumatic event or use of medication. Magnetic resonance imaging was essential for making the preoperative diagnosis. Neurosurgical cyst removal proved to be an effective treatment.",M2
18558805,"Cholinergic neurotransmission from mechanosensory afferents to giant interneurons in the terminal abdominal <e>ganglion</e> of the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus.Crickets respond to air currents with quick avoidance behavior. The terminal abdominal ganglion (TAG) has a neuronal circuit for a wind-detection system to elicit this behavior. We investigated neuronal transmission from cercal sensory afferent neurons to ascending giant interneurons (GIs). Pharmacological treatment with 500 muM acetylcholine (ACh) increased neuronal activities of ascending interneurons with cell bodies located in the TAG. The effects of ACh antagonists on the activities of identified GIs were examined. The muscarinic ACh antagonist atropine at 3-mM concentration had no obvious effect on the activities of GIs 10-3, 10-2, or 9-3. On the other hand, a 3-mM concentration of the nicotinic ACh antagonist mecamylamine decreased spike firing of these interneurons. Immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal anti-conjugated acetylcholine antibody revealed the distribution of cholinergic neurons in the TAG. The cercal sensory afferent neurons running through the cercal nerve root showed cholinergic immunoreactivity, and the cholinergic immunoreactive region in the neuropil overlapped with the terminal arborizations of the cercal sensory afferent neurons. Cell bodies in the median region of the TAG also showed cholinergic immunoreactivity. This indicates that not only sensory afferent neurons but also other neurons that have cell bodies in the TAG could use ACh as a neurotransmitter.",M2

18509691,"Compression of the deep branch of the ulnar nerve in Guyon's canal by a <e>ganglion</e>: two cases.INTRODUCTION: Ulnar nerve compression at the wrist can be caused by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Isolated compression of only the deep branch of ulnar nerve by a ganglion is very uncommon. Ultrasound examination can clearly show the cystic lesion compressing the nerves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present two cases of compression of deep branch of ulnar nerve by a ganglion in the Guyon's canal. Two male patients presented with history of progressive weakness and paraesthesia in the medial 1(1/2) digits of the non-dominant hand. Interestingly, both the patients noticed sudden onset and rapid progress of the symptoms and signs. Clinical examination revealed typical symptoms of ulnar nerve (deep branch) palsy. Nerve conduction studies showed severe denervation of the deep branch of the ulnar nerves in both the patients and ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis. Surgical decompression led to complete recovery. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Whilst compression by a ganglion in the Guyon's canal is rare but well recognized, a feature of both of our cases was the rapid progression and severe nature of the compressive symptoms and signs. This is in contrast to the more typical features of compressive neuropathy and should alert the clinician to the possible underlying cause of compression. Early decompression has the potential to promote a complete recovery.",M2
18455665,"A posttraumatic, joint-connected sural intraneural <e>ganglion</e> cyst-with a new mechanism of intraneural recurrence: a case report.Intraneural ganglion cysts are rare in occurrence and most commonly involve the peroneal nerve at the fibular neck. We present a case of a traumatically induced intraneural ganglion cyst of the sural nerve that developed after a nondisplaced posterior malleolus ankle fracture. The intraneural ganglion cyst was connected to the subtalar joint by its articular branch and ascended several centimeters into the distal fourth of the leg. It was resected from the sural nerve proper and the posterior branch of the lateral calcaneal nerve, and the articular trunk was ligated. The patient developed subclinical intraneural recurrence, which was detected on a postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Retrospective reinterpretation of the preoperative and postoperative MRIs revealed that ligation of the articular trunk proximal to a major branch (ie, the anterior branch of the lateral calcaneal nerve) led to increased intraneural cyst propagation distally: within the blind stump of the articular trunk and within several anterior branches of the lateral calcaneal nerve but not within the parent sural nerve or its continuation, the lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve. This mode of intraneural, but extraparental nerve recurrence can be easily understood by considering the altered fluid dynamics, particularly the increased resistance. This case report provides further evidence not only supporting the articular theory of intraneural ganglion formation but also highlighting the importance of searching for, identifying, and treating the pathologic articular branch connection near its joint connection in all cases.

18434161,"<e>Ganglion</e> cysts of the posterior cruciate ligament.Ganglion cysts of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) are uncommon lesions found incidentally on MRI and arthroscopy. Twenty patients (11 males and nine females) with the mean age of 35 years presenting with a variety of knee signs and symptoms were found to have PCL cysts on MRI. Out of these, thirteen patients (65%) had isolated symptomatic PCL cysts and seven patients had associated chondral and meniscal lesions. Eight out of the 20 patients (40%) gave a history of antecedent trauma. On arthroscopy, the majority of the cysts were situated at the midsubstance of the ligament with inter-cruciate distension and no involvement of the substance of the ligament. The content of the cysts varied with the majority having yellowish viscous fluid and three containing serous and bloody fluid. All cysts were successfully treated arthroscopically through standard anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral portals with no signs of recurrence on MRI at a mean followup of 24 months. PCL cysts may clinically mimic meniscal or chondral lesions and preoperatively, MRI is essential for the diagnosis of ganglion cysts arising from the PCL.

18350738,"Sonographic features of soft tissue tumors in the hand and forearm.BACKGROUND: High-resolution sonography is well suited for screening soft tissue masses because of its safety, low cost, and real-time, dynamic imaging. The purpose of our study was to elaborate the preoperative sonographic features of soft tissue tumors of the hand and forearm and the corresponding histologic results. METHODS: Thirty-one soft tissue tumors of the hand and forearm were evaluated by ultrasound preoperatively. The mobility, consistency, echogenicity, margin, and color Doppler signal of each tumor were assessed. Dynamic study was also performed. The pathologic diagnosis was obtained after subsequent surgery. RESULTS: The pathologic diagnoses of these soft tissue lesions were lipoma (n = 6), <e>ganglion</e> cyst (n = 6), neurilemmoma (n = 3), neurofibroma (n = 3), giant cell tumor (n = 10), tenosynovitis (n = 2), and malignant lymphoma (n = 1). An adjacent tendon or communication duct extending to the joint space could be found in most giant cell tumors and ganglion cysts; a traceable nerve could be found in most nerve sheath tumors. All benign tumors appeared well-defined. The only malignant tumor appeared ill-defined without a color Doppler signal. CONCLUSION: Sonography enables a reliable diagnosis of the cystic or solid nature of soft-tissue lesions, accurate estimation of the volume, and precise three-dimensional localization of the abnormality. Examiners should perform a dynamic examination and trace the adjacent structure to obtain more diagnostic clues.",M2
18330922,"Patterns of intraneural <e>ganglion</e> cyst descent.On the basis of the principles of the unifying articular theory, predictable patterns of proximal ascent have been described for fibular (peroneal) and tibial intraneural ganglion cysts in the knee region. The mechanism underlying distal descent into the terminal branches of the fibular and tibial nerves has not been previously elucidated. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate if and when cyst descent distal to the articular branch-joint connection occurs in intraneural ganglion cysts to understand directionality of intraneural cyst propagation. In Part I, the clinical records and MRIs of 20 consecutive patients treated at our institution for intraneural ganglion cysts (18 fibular and two tibial) arising from the superior tibiofibular joint were retrospectively analyzed. These patients underwent cyst decompression and disconnection of the articular branch. Five of these patients developed symptomatic cyst recurrence after cyst decompression without articular branch disconnection which was done elsewhere prior to our intervention. In Part II, five additional patients with intraneural ganglion cysts (three fibular and two tibial) treated at other institutions without disconnection of the articular branch were compared. These patients in Parts I and II demonstrated ascent of intraneural cyst to differing degrees (12 had evidence of sciatic nerve cross-over). In addition, all of these patients demonstrated previously unrecognized MRI evidence of intraneural cyst extending distally below the level of the articular branch to the joint of origin: cyst within the proximal most portions of the deep fibular and superficial fibular branches in fibular intraneural ganglion cysts and descending tibial branches in tibial intraneural ganglion cysts. The patients in Part I had complete resolution of their cysts at follow-up MRI examination 1 year postoperatively. The patients in Part II had intraneural recurrences postoperatively within the articular branch, the parent nerve, and the terminal branches, although in three cases they were subclinical. The authors demonstrate that cyst descent distal to the take-off of the articular branch to the joint of origin occurs regularly in patients with fibular and tibial intraneural ganglion cysts. The authors believe that parent terminal branch descent follows ascent up the articular branch from an affected joint of origin. This mechanism for bidirectional flow explains cyst within terminal branches of the fibular and tibial nerves and is dependent on pressure fluxes and resistances. This new pattern is consistent with principles previously described in a unified (articular) theory, is generalizable to other intraneural ganglion cysts arising from joints, and has important implications for pathogenesis and treatment of these intraneural cysts.",M2
18271803,"Experimental pseudocyst model resembling human <e>ganglion</e>.There is no animal model of ganglion. We describe a simple and reproducible animal model of pseudocystic diseases. First, we experimented to establish a pseudocystic model. We used cylindrical glass implants (6 mm diameter, 30 mm long) to create fibrous capsules in rats. The implants were inserted in the subcutaneous tissue in the dorsum of rats. Sixty implants were carried out (two implants per rat). Twelve weeks after implantation, the glass implants were removed and 0.5 mL sodium hyaluronate solution was injected into each cavity. Next, we tested the model by histological examination after OK-432 administration. Microscopic examination revealed that the wall was composed of a layer of collagenous fibers similar to those noted in ganglia; the lumen was retained for 3 weeks. Histopathological changes after OK-432 administration showed nonspecific inflammatory response induced by OK-432, resulting in in vivo activation of many inflammatory cells and then fast and reliable closure of cavities. No harmful reactions to OK-432 were observed histopathologically. These data suggest that our experimental cyst is a suitable model for studying pseudocystic diseases. This model can be used for research evaluating safe drug doses, conducting therapeutic comparison of several agents, and histopathological time course studies of the affected tissues. OK-432 administration on this model showed the potential of one of the ideal agents to treat pseudocystic lesions like ganglion.",M2
18220283,"Cross-over: a generalizable phenomenon necessary for secondary intraneural <e>ganglion</e> cyst formation.The appearances of intraneural ganglion cysts are being elucidated. We previously introduced the cross-over phenomenon to explain how a fibular (peroneal) or tibial intraneural ganglion cyst arising from the superior tibiofibular joint could give rise to multiple cysts: cyst fluid ascending up the primarily affected nerve could reach the level of the sciatic nerve, fill its common epineurial sheath and spread circumferentially (cross over), at which time pressure fluxes could result in further ascent up the sciatic or descent down the same parent nerve or the opposite, previously unaffected fibular or tibial nerves. In this study, we hypothesized that cross-over could occur in other nerves, potentially leading to the formation of more than one intraneural ganglion cyst in such situations. We analyzed the literature and identified a single case that we could review where proximal extension of an intraneural ganglion cyst involving a nerve at a different site could theoretically undergo cross-over in another major nerve large enough for available magnetic resonance images to resolve this finding. A case of a suprascapular intraneural ganglion cyst previously reported by our group that arose from the glenohumeral joint and extended to the neck was reanalyzed for the presence or absence of cross-over. An injection of dye into the outer epineurium of the suprascapular nerve in a fresh cadaveric specimen was performed to test for cross-over experimentally. Retrospective review of this case of suprascapular intraneural ganglion cyst demonstrated evidence to support previously unrecognized cross-over at the level of the upper trunk, with predominant ascent up the C5 and the C6 nerve roots and subtle descent down the anterior and posterior divisions of the upper trunk as well as the proximal portion of the suprascapular nerve. This appearance gave rise to multiple interconnected intraneural ganglion cysts arising from a single distant connection to the glenohumeral joint. The injection study also demonstrated the cross-over phenomenon and produced a similar pattern as the cyst dissection. This article illustrates that cross-over can occur in another nerve (apart from the prototype fibular nerve). Furthermore, understanding the more complex anatomic nature of the upper trunk cross-over model provides insight into important mechanistic information regarding the bidirectional propagation patterns and formation of primary and secondary intraneural ganglion cysts not afforded by the previously described sciatic nerve cross-over model.",M2

A history of knee trauma and a palpable mass of the lateral knee in the region of the peroneal nerve are common. We present the unusual case of an intraneural ganglion cyst of the peroneal nerve in a 4-year-old girl. Although extremely rare in the pediatric population, the condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with new-onset foot deformities, foot drop, or clinical examinations consistent with a peroneal nerve lesion. Surgical treatment consisting of ganglion decompression with exploration and ligation of the articular branch of the peroneal nerve may result in improved functional recovery in the pediatric population compared with the adult population. Greater access to magnetic resonance imaging may allow diagnosis of cases that were not previously identified.",M2

CLINICAL PICTURE: We present 2 patients who complained of dull, poorly localised shoulder pain, which worsened with overhead activities. Magnetic resonance imaging showed ganglion cysts in the spinoglenoid notch. TREATMENT: Both patients failed conservative management with physiotherapy and underwent shoulder arthroscopy. One patient underwent arthroscopic decompression of the cyst and the other had open excision of the cyst. OUTCOME: Both patients experienced resolution of symptoms within 6 months of surgery. CONCLUSION: With appropriate treatment, suprascapular nerve neuropathy secondary to ganglion cyst impingement is a treatable condition with potentially good results.",M2

METHODS: Thirteen wrists of 12 patients (2 males, 10 females; mean age 28 years; range 21 to 41 years) were treated with surgical excision for ganglia originating from the dorsal scapholunate interosseous ligament. Involvement was on the right side in six patients, and on the left in five patients, with one patient having bilateral involvement. None of the patients had a history of trauma, except two with a history of fall. All the patients had complaints of wrist pain that occurred during work and subsided at rest. The mean duration of wrist pain was 23 months (range 6 to 60 months). All the patients received conservative treatment previously with wrist splints and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Finger extension test was positive and magnetic resonance imaging of the wrist showed ganglion in all the patients. Functional results were evaluated by the Mayo Clinic wrist pain assessment scores after a mean follow-up of 35 months (range 25 to 49 months). RESULTS: Complaints of wrist pain improved dramatically in all the patients. Scores of the Mayo Clinic wrist pain assessment were excellent in seven patients (53.9%), good in five patients (38.5%), and moderate in one patient (7.7%). All the patients returned to work without any limitation of wrist movements. No recurrences were seen during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Occult ganglia originating from the scapholunate ligament should be remembered in patients with dorsal scapholunate joint tenderness and pain unresponsive to conservative treatment and with a positive finger extension test.",M2
18177395,"Nail changes and association of osteoarthritis in digital myxoid cyst.BACKGROUND: Digital myxoid cyst is relatively common on the digits. Nail changes and osteoarthritis are usually associated with this pathogenesis. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to clarify this relationship and its significance by analyzing the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic data. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-one patients with digital myxoid cysts were diagnosed and analyzed during a 5-year period. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (74.5%) of 51 patients showed radiologic evidence of primary interphalangeal joint osteoarthritis in the affected digits. Among the 39 cysts removed surgically and examined pathologically, 28 were myxomatous and 11 were <e>ganglion</e>. Different clinical manifestations of nail change, including longitudinal grooves (20 cases), concave canaliform dystrophy (9 cases),  washboard  transverse lines (5 cases), and longitudinal grooves with beaded ridges (1 case) were found. CONCLUSION: Osteoarthritis of the adjacent terminal joint is an important factor involved in forming digital myxoid cysts. Of the two cyst types, ganglion cysts are related to osteoarthritis more often than myxomatous cysts. Nail changes, secondary to matrix damage, are reliable clinical signs of underlying cyst formation. Understanding the pathogenesis of the digital myxoid cyst in relation to osteoarthritis and nail deformity helps inform the care of these patients.",M2

DESIGN: A retrospective study including 57 patients with wrist pain consecutively referred for sonographic examination. The inclusion criteria for this study were a history of wrist pain longer than 3 mos with no wrist trauma, and no palpable mass at the wrist. Ultrasound examination with a 10-MHz linear transducer was used to detect wrist pathology. A well-demarcated anechoic mass with posterior enhancement and without vascularity within the mass on sonography was defined as a ganglion cyst. RESULTS: Thirty-three of the 57 patients (58%) were diagnosed by sonographic examination as having a ganglion in the wrist joint. The size of the ganglion demonstrated on sonographic imaging ranged from 2 x 5 mm to 10 x 9 mm on a longitudinal scan of the wrist (with a mean of 4 x 7 mm.). Surgical excision was carried out in 12 patients who had ganglions diagnosed by sonographic examination; in all cases, the mucin content of the specimen was demonstrated. Eight patients underwent local aspiration followed by steroid injection under the guidance of ultrasound. The aspirated content was a jelly-like substance. In these 20 treated patients, symptoms of wrist pain improved after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of occult carpal ganglion is common in chronic wrist pain patients. High-resolution sonographic examination facilitates early detection of occult carpal ganglion.",M2

We saw a 55-year-old female who developed progressive failure of the ulnar nerve 55 years after 20Gy (226)Ra brachytherapy of a haemangioma of the left elbow at the age of 3 months. Nerve compression at the sulcus segment was caused by the intraneural growth of a neurofibroma and the formation of a nerve sheath ganglion. The rapidly progressive symptoms required operative treatment. Due to the infiltrating tumour growth we decided to resect this segment of the ulnar nerve and reconstruct it with an interfascicular nerve graft. This case demonstrates a rare possible consequence of radiotherapy in which the co-existence of two benign lesions required surgical intervention. Radiotherapy-induced malignant tumours and tissue scarring are well known as complications. The present case suggests further possible late effects of radiotherapy to consider.",M2

17912132,"Acute hemorrhagic cyst of the ligamentum flavum.STUDY DESIGN: A case report and clinical discussion. OBJECTIVE: To describe a rare complication of a cyst of the ligamentum flavum, which bled spontaneously, provoking an acute lower limb monoparesis and lumbar sciatic pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUNDS DATA: Cysts of the ligamentum flavum have been rarely reported. Intraspinal degenerative cysts described in literature are usually juxta-articular (synovial and <e>ganglion</e>) cysts and have a similar radiologic appearance. They are preferentially located in the lumbar spine, while the cervical localization is unusual. Hemorrhage into the cyst is an uncommon complication and an extremely rare cause of nerve root compression. METHODS: A 59-year-old woman presented with sudden severe radicular lumbar deficit and pain secondary to acute hemorrhage into a ligamentum flavum cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging showed at L3-L4 level a lobulated slightly hyperintense mass with a ventral area of marked hyperintensity in T1 images, hypointense on T2 images. Signal within the lesion was suggestive of intralesional hemorrhage. RESULTS: Complete resection of the lesion was performed, resulting in immediate recovery. The cyst was quite rounded, brownish, and contained rest of both partially fresh and coagulated hematoma. Histologic examination revealed myxoid degeneration of the ligamentum flavum with an hemorrage in the cystic cavity without a synovial layer. CONCLUSIONS: This report identifies a rare case of radicular lumbar deficit and pain secondary to acute hemorrhage into a ligamentum flavum cyst. The pathogenesis and clinicopathologic characteristics of this lesion are described.",M2

This article presents a case of intraosseous ganglion of the talus in a 38-year-old woman treated with a new surgical approach and technique. The patient had mild ankle pain at the arc of motion in her right ankle that increased with activity. Radiographs and magnetic resonance images showed a cystic lesion in the medial side of the talar dome. It was treated by curettage and autocorticocancellous bone grafting through an opening in the talonavicular joint without disturbing the intact talar dome cartilage.

17901135,"Sonography of wrist <e>ganglion</e> cysts: variable and noncystic appearances.OBJECTIVE: In our clinical practice, we have noted wrist ganglion cysts that do not fulfill the criteria for simple cysts. This study retrospectively evaluated the sonographic features of wrist ganglia. METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval, medical records from 1993 through 2003 were searched using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes and key words, and sonography log books from 2000 through 2004 were reviewed, which identified 20 wrist ganglion cysts in 16 patients that were proven at surgery or aspiration. A retrospective review of sonographic images was carried out by 2 musculoskeletal radiologists by consensus. Images were evaluated for cyst location, volume, largest dimension, joint or tendon extension, echogenicity, septations, internal echogenicity, posterior acoustic enhancement, margins, lobularity, and vascularity. RESULTS: Of the 20 wrist ganglia, 15 were volar (10 between the flexor carpi radialis and the radial artery), and 5 were dorsal (2 over the scapholunate ligament). The mean volume was 2081 mm3 (range, 90-15,000 mm3), and the mean largest dimension was 17.3 mm (range, 7-30 mm). Seven volar ganglia showed joint communication. Ten ganglia were anechoic; 7 were hypoechoic; and 3 had anechoic and hypoechoic areas. Eight had septations; 8 had internal echogenic areas; 15 had posterior acoustic enhancement; 13 had well-defined margins; 12 were lobular; and none were vascular. Cysts that were anechoic (P &lt; .0001) or with posterior acoustic enhancement (P = .04) were significantly larger than those that were hypoechoic or without posterior acoustic enhancement. CONCLUSIONS: Small wrist ganglion cysts (&lt; or = 10 mm in the mean largest dimension) often appear hypoechoic without posterior acoustic enhancement and do not fulfill the criteria for a simple cyst.",M2

17695383,"Dynamic phases of peroneal and tibial intraneural ganglia formation: a new dimension added to the unifying articular theory.OBJECT: The pathogenesis of intraneural ganglia has been a controversial issue for longer than a century. Recently the authors identified a stereotypical pattern of occurrence of peroneal and tibial intraneural ganglia, and based on an understanding of their pathogenesis provided a unifying articular explanation. Atypical features, which occasionally are observed, have offered an opportunity to verify further and expand on the authors' proposed theory. METHODS: Three unusual cases are presented to exemplify the dynamic features of peroneal and tibial intraneural ganglia formation. RESULTS: Two patients with a predominant deep peroneal nerve deficit shared essential anatomical findings common to peroneal intraneural ganglia: namely, 1) joint connections to the anterior portion of the superior tibiofibular joint, and 2) dissection of the cyst along the articular branch of the peroneal nerve and proximally. Magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in these patients demonstrated some unusual findings, including the presence of a cyst within the tibial and sural nerves in the popliteal fossa region, and spontaneous regression of the cysts, which was observed on serial images obtained weeks apart. The authors identified a clinical outlier, a case that could not be understood within the context of their previously reported theory of intraneural <e>ganglion</e> cyst formation. Described 32 years ago, this patient had a tibial neuropathy and was found at surgery to have tibial, peroneal, and sciatic intraneural cysts without a joint connection. The authors' hypothesis about this case, based on their unified theory, was twofold: 1) the lesion was a primary tibial intraneural ganglion with proximal extension followed by sciatic cross-over and distal descent; and 2) a joint connection to the posterior aspect of the superior tibiofibular joint with a remnant cyst within the articular branch would be present, a finding that would help explain the formation of different cysts by a single mechanism. The authors proved their hypothesis by careful inspection of a recently obtained postoperative MR image. CONCLUSIONS: These three cases together with data obtained from a retrospective review of the authors' clinical material and findings reported in the literature provide firm evidence for mechanisms underlying intraneural ganglia formation. Thus, expansion of the authors' unified articular theory permits understanding and elucidation of unusual presentations of intraneural cysts. Whereas an articular connection and fluid following the path of least resistance was pivotal, the authors now incorporate dynamic aspects of cyst formation due to pressure fluxes. These basic principles explain patterns of ascent, cross-over, and descent down terminal nerve branches based on articular connections, paths of diminished resistance to fluid flow within recognized anatomical compartments, and the effects of fluctuating pressure gradients.",M2

The proper preoperative diagnosis and identification of this joint connection for ganglion cysts is important for patient treatment and outcome. MRI is the imaging modality of choice when evaluating such lesions, but the detection of subtle joint connections remains difficult with conventional MR protocols. We investigated the utility of a steady-state free-precession acquisition with isotropic high resolution using the vastly undersampled isotropic projection reconstruction (VIPR) pulse sequence to determine if joint connections for ganglion cysts could be seen more effectively, using the knee region as a model. We evaluated four patients: two with peroneal intraneural ganglion cysts, one with adventitial cystic disease of the popliteal artery, and one patient with a more typical extraneural (intramuscular) cyst. Both conventional MR and VIPR techniques were used. In our clinical experience, we found VIPR to be superior to conventional MR techniques in detecting and depicting joint connections in typical and atypical ganglion cysts around the knee.",M2

17559102,"Epineurial compartments and their role in intraneural <e>ganglion</e> cyst propagation: an experimental study.New patterns of intraneural ganglion cyst formation are emerging that have not previously been explained in current pathoanatomic terms. We believe there are three important elements underlying the appearance of these cysts: (a) an articular branch of the nerve that connects to a nearby synovial joint; (b) ejected synovial fluid following the path of least resistance along tissue planes; and (c) the additional effects of pressure and pressure fluxes. The dynamic nature of cyst formation has become clearly apparent to us in our clinical, operative and pathologic practice, but the precise mechanism underlying the process has not been critically studied. To test our hypothesis that a fibular (peroneal) or tibial intraneural cyst derived from the superior tibiofibular joint could ascend proximally into the sciatic nerve, expand within it and descend into terminal branches of this major nerve, we designed a series of simple, qualitative laboratory experiments in two cadavers (four specimens, six experiments). Injecting dye into the outer or  epifascicular  epineurium of the fibular and the tibial nerves we observed its ascent, cross over and descent patterns in three of three specimens as well as its cross over after an outer epineurial sciatic injection. In contrast, injecting dye into the inner or  interfascicular  epineurium led to its ascent within the tibial nerve and its division within the sciatic nerve in one specimen and lack of cross over in a sciatic nerve injection. Histologic cross-sections of the nerves at varying levels demonstrated a tract of disruption within the outer epineurium of the nerve injected and the nerve(s) into which the dye, after cross over, descended. Those specimens injected in the inner epineurium demonstrated dye within this tract but without disruption of or dye intrusion into the outer epineurium. In no case did the dye pass through the perineurial layers. Coupled with our observations in previous detailed studies, these anatomic findings provide proof of concept that sciatic cross over occurs due to the filling of its common epineurial sheath; furthermore, these findings, support the unifying articular theory, even in cases wherein patterns of intraneural ganglion cyst formation are unusual. Additional work is needed to be done to correlate these anatomic findings with magnetic resonance imaging and surgical pathology.",M2

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cystic lesions with synovio-capsular thickening along the temporomandibular joints (TMJ), atlanto-axial synovial articulation, and tendons and joints of the right wrist and hand. Histopathological examination of one lesion showed anastomosing fibro-connective tissue surrounded by a wall of smooth muscle and fibrous connective tissue, findings that were consistent with ganglion cyst.

17466046,"Vesicouterine ligament contains abundant autonomic nerve <e>ganglion</e> cells: the distribution in histology concerning nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy.The aim of this study is to describe the histologic architecture of the tissues corresponding to the surgically developed connective tissue bundle commonly referred to as the posterior leaf of the vesico-uterine ligament (VUL), and to examine distribution of ganglion cells. Serial macroscopic slices, each 15-20 mm in thickness, were made from eight specimens (obtained from six female elderly cadavers). In these macroslices, the location of the deep uterine vein was used to identify the deep leaf of the VUL. The specimens were trimmed and semi-serial histologic sections in thickness were prepared at 1 mm intervals. Vesical veins and the associated nerve elements were enclosed by fascia and formed a common pedicle. The base of the pedicle contained the deep uterine vein trunk. The fascia encircling the pedicle varied in thickness and connective intensity between specimens. This vesical neurovascular bundle contained abundant ganglion cells. On average, 48.0% of the ganglion cells along the vesical tributaries of the deep uterine vein were located on the medial or vaginal side of the veins, 19.2% were located between veins, 13.0% on the lateral side of the veins, and 19.8% on the dorsal side. The interindividual variability was greatest on the dorsal side of vesical veins and ranged 11-202 cells. We conclude that in order to achieve maximal preservation of the ganglion cells during the surgical dissection of the posterior leaf of the VUL, care must be taken when the medial or vesical aspect of the ligament is separated. The standard nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy should be modified to reflect differences in the distribution of ganglion cells and in connective intensity between ganglions and veins.",M2

There is a low diagnostic accuracy for foot lumps and, therefore, surgical excision and histological diagnosis should be sought if there is any uncertainty.",M2
17484955,"Bone tumor mimics: avoiding misdiagnosis.Whether discovered incidentally or as part of a focused diagnostic evaluation, the finding of a benign osseous lesion that has radiologic features resembling a bone tumor is not uncommon. Some of the more common benign and nonneoplastic entities that can sometimes be confused with tumors are the following: cortical desmoid, Brodie abscess, synovial herniation pit, pseudocyst, enostosis, intraosseous <e>ganglion</e> cyst, fibrous dysplasia, stress fracture, avulsion fracture (healing stage), bone infarct, myositis ossificans, brown tumor, and subchondral cyst. Accurate diagnosis and management of these lesions require a basic understanding of their epidemiology, clinical presentations, anatomic distributions, imaging features, differential considerations, and therapeutic options. This in-depth review of 13 potential bone tumor mimics will assist the radiologist in correctly identifying these benign lesions and in avoiding misdiagnosis and related morbidity. This review will also aid the radiologist in making appropriate recommendations to the referring physician for management or further imaging.",M2
17483635,"[The importance of finger extension test in the diagnosis of occult wrist <e>ganglion</e>]OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic tools in comparison with surgical results of occult ganglion cyst of the wrist, which is one of the causes of chronic wrist pain. METHODS: Twenty-five patients (4 males, 21 females; mean age 29 years; range 16 to 46 years) underwent surgery with an initial diagnosis of occult ganglion following unsuccessful conservative treatment. The mean symptom duration was 29 months (range 3 months to 10 years). Diagnosis was based on finger extension test performed in 24 patients. Six patients and 13 patients were assessed by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. Interosseous neurectomy was performed in three patients. The mean follow-up was 31 months (range 6 to 72 months). RESULTS: Occult dorsal ganglion was resected from the scapholunate interval in 22 patients (88%). No ganglion was found in three patients, who had only degeneration of the scapholunate ligament. Finger extension test was positive in 23 patients. One patient with a negative test result was found to have degeneration of the scapholunate ligament. The test yielded two false positive results, one of which was negative by MRI. Surgical confirmation was achieved in 11 patients evaluated by MRI and in four patients evaluated by ultrasonography. Diagnostic accuracy rates for MRI, ultrasonography, and finger extension test were 92%, 66%, and 92%, respectively. Two patients (8%) underwent reoperation for recurrence. None of the patients complained of instability in the late period. Except for one patient, all patients (96%) were asymptomatic at final evaluations. CONCLUSION: Finger extension test is an important diagnostic tool for occult ganglion with 92% accuracy. Both diagnosis and treatment of occult ganglion cysts have become easier by evolving diagnostic tools.",M2
