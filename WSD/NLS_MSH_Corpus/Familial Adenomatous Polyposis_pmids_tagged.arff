20140021,"Myc heterozygosity attenuates the phenotypes of APC deficiency in the small intestine.The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene encodes APC tumour suppressor protein, germline mutation of which causes <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, an autosomal intestinal cancer syndrome. We have previously demonstrated that the proto-oncogene c-Myc is essential for all the phenotypes that occur after APC loss in the murine small intestine. One caveat to this study is that it was performed in the complete absence of c-Myc. In this study, we show that heterozygosity for Myc reduces the phenotypes of APC loss and Wnt target gene expression and slows tumourigenesis. Crucially, the levels of Myc are twofold higher than wild-type levels showing that the level of Myc induced by Wnt signalling is absolutely vital for the fate of APC-deficient cells. Taken together, this suggests that c-Myc inhibition may be a viable chemoprevention strategy for colorectal cancer.",M1
20102718,"Clonality assessment and clonal ordering of individual neoplastic crypts shows polyclonality of colorectal adenomas.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: According to the somatic mutation theory, monoclonal colorectal lesions arise from sequential mutations in the progeny of a single stem cell. However, studies in a sex chromosome mixoploid mosaic (XO/XY) patient indicated that colorectal adenomas were polyclonal. We assessed adenoma clonality on an individual crypt basis and completed a genetic dependency analysis in carcinomas-in-adenomas to assess mutation order and timing. METHODS: Polyp samples were analyzed from the XO/XY individual, patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, patients with small sporadic adenomas, and patients with sporadic carcinoma-in-adenomas. Clonality was analyzed using X/Y chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization, analysis of 5q loss of heterozygosity in XO/XY tissue, and sequencing of adenomatous polyposis coli. Individual crypts and different phenotypic areas of carcinoma-in-adenoma lesions were analyzed for mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli, p53, and K-RAS; loss of heterozygosity at 5q, 17p, and 18q; and aneuploidy. Phylogenetic trees were constructed. RESULTS: All familial adenomatous polyposis-associated adenomas and some sporadic lesions had polyclonal genetic defects. Some independent clones appeared to be maintained in advanced adenomas. No clear obligate order of genetic events was established. Top-down growth of dysplastic tissue into neighboring crypts was a possible mechanism of clonal competition. CONCLUSIONS: Human colorectal microadenomas are polyclonal and may arise from a combination of host genetic features, mucosal exposures, and active crypt interactions. Analyses of tumor phylogenies show that most lesions undergo intermittent genetic homogenization, but heterotypic mutation patterns indicate that independent clonal evolution can occur throughout adenoma development. Based on observations of clonal ordering the requirement and timing of genetic events during neoplastic progression may be more variable than previously thought.",M1
20063100,"[Gardner fibroma: case report and discussion of a new soft tissue tumor entity]Gardner fibroma represents a rare and recently described soft tissue tumor entity in children and young adults. It consists of haphazardly arranged coarse and hyalinized collagen fibers combined with loosely arranged bland spindle and fibroblastic cells. The case of a 13-year-old male patient with Gardner fibroma and osteoma and multicentric desmoid type fibromatosis in his mother is presented with detection of a (heterozygotic) germline mutation of the APC gene leading to a de novo stop codon (deletion of base pairs 5033-5036). FISH analysis revealed a structural loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the APC gene on chromosomal locus 5q21 in one out of five analysed desmoids of the mother, no LOH of APC gene in the Gardner fibroma. Gardner fibroma in children and young adults may serve as an indicator lesion for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP), Gardner syndrome, a familial desmoid type fibromatosis without other manifestations of APC or a new APC gene mutation. For the clinician, this diagnosis should be commented upon accordingly by the surgical pathologist. As the result of a detected APC gene mutation, continuous follow-up for the development of colorectal tumors and desmoid type fibromatosis as well as a familial screening for FAP is recommended.",M1
19701947,"The APC Variant p.Glu1317Gln predisposes to colorectal adenomas by a novel mechanism of relaxing the target for tumorigenic somatic APC mutations.Multiple rare nonsynonymous variants in APC predispose to colorectal adenomas. The mechanisms through which such variants act have been unclear, but it has been proposed that a specific ( just-right ) level of beta-catenin signaling is required for colorectal tumorigenesis. This appears to be mediated by selection for APC genotypes that retain one, or rarely two, 20 amino acid beta-catenin downregulating repeats (20AARs). We investigated the mechanism through which the variant p.Glu1317Gln (c.3949G&gt;C) contributes to colorectal tumorigenesis. We compared the patterns of somatic APC mutations in tumors from patients with attenuated <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (AFAP) who did, or did not, coinherit p.Glu1317Gln with their AFAP-causing APC mutations. Only 8.2% (4/49) of tumors carrying p.Glu1317Gln had somatic mutations predicted to result in mutant polypeptides retaining a single 20AAR, compared to 62.1% (36/58) of those which did not carry this variant (P=5.64 x 10(-9)). Furthermore, tumors with p.Glu1317Gln often carried somatic mutations that were unusually early or late (downstream of the second 20AAR) in the APC open reading frame. These data support a novel mechanism in which p.Glu1317Gln in combination with other weak mutant APC alleles (generating polypepetides with zero, two, or three 20AARs) can provide the necessary growth advantage for colorectal tumorigenesis.",M1
19573802,"Gardner's syndrome (<e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>): a cilia-related disorder.Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant form of intestinal polyposis and colorectal cancer caused by germ-line mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. The term Gardner's syndrome is used to describe extracolonic manifestations, such as osteomas, skin cysts, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium (CHRPE), and desmoid tumours (aggressive fibromatosis), that are especially prominent in families with FAP. We postulate that a ciliary dysfunction is the underlying pathogenetic mechanism of extraintestinal manifestations in patients with FAP. This postulation is based on the presence of common clinical manifestations (ie, cysts, retinal abnormalities, and fibrosis) in Gardner's syndrome and cilia-related disorders. Additionally, both APC and the cilia have degradation of beta-catenin as the common downstream target in the Wnt-signalling pathway. Mutations in APC causing Gardner's syndrome are clustered in a region encoding a series of amino-acid repeats responsible for the binding to beta-catenin. Proofs of principle that beta-catenin could be the key mediator of the ciliary disorder also rely in the findings that overexpression of beta-catenin induces polycystic kidney disease, and CHRPE phenotypes in animal models. Other candidates for the common link between Gardner's syndrome and cilia-related disorders are the APC-binding proteins: end-binding protein 1 (EB1) and kinesin-family-member 3a (KIF3a), both of which are ciliary proteins involved in intraflagellar transport. Finally, pathogenetic similarities between some ciliopathies and extraintestinal tumours in FAP suggest a cilia defect. Understanding extracolonic manifestations in the context of FAP as a ciliary disorder might add new therapeutic options for patients with Gardner's syndrome.",M1
19386568,"[Long-term experience with therapy of a female patient with Gardner's syndrome, first presenting with extra-abdominal desmoid tumor, and review of the literature]Gardner's syndrome is a clinical subgroup of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, an autosomal dominant disease. It is characterized by gastrointestinal polyps and extra-intestinal manifestations including multiple osteomas, skin and soft tissue tumours. Aggressive desmoid tumours can be very difficult to manage in patients with Gardner's syndrome. We present a case of a 17-year-old female who presented with an aggressive desmoid tumor arising of the lumbar area as part of her Gardner's syndrome. She was treated with surgery, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tamoxifen and radiotherapy, and was followed up for 80 months. We conclude that desmoid tumors can precede gastrointestinal manifestations of familial adenomatous polyposis or Gardner's syndrome. Such patients should be evaluated with genetic testing followed by colonoscopy. Desmoid tumours should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting, as well.",M1
18629513,"Report of a family segregating mutations in both the APC and MSH2 genes: juvenile onset of colorectal cancer in a double heterozygote.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes are associated with high risk of digestive malignancies [hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC); Lynch syndrome]; mutations of APC and MYH are associated with classic and attenuated <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP). Although the early onset of tumors in both syndromes is characteristic of their genetic origin, pediatric malignancies remain rare. Certain reports have found familial colorectal cancer (CRC) occurring in very young patients associated with mutations in more than one gene. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A family corresponding to the Amsterdam criteria for HNPCC, including two cases of colorectal cancer before the age of 25 years, was analyzed for mutations in the MSH2 genes by sequencing. Because polyposis was observed in a patient who developed CRC at age 16, the APC gene was also sequenced. RESULTS: A truncating mutation in the MSH2 gene, c.258_259delTG, was carried by patients developing cancer of the colon (two patients), uterus, kidney, bladder, and/or small intestine at ages 16, 24, 43, 44, 45, and 57, respectively. A patient with CRC at age 16 was found to carry the APC c.3183_3187del5 mutation as well as the MSH2 mutation, and it is inferred that her father, deceased of CRC at age 24, was also a double heterozygote. INTERPRETATION: These results confirm that vigilance is required when interpreting molecular results for families with very young patients, as more than one gene may contribute to the genetic risk. Cancer screening measures must also be adapted to the earlier and more penetrant risk to double heterozygotes.",M1
18063360,"Inherited multitumoral syndromes including colorectal carcinoma.Inherited multitumoral syndromes including colorectal carcinoma are the followings: <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP), hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS). The studies of genotype-phenotype correlation have shown that various types of colonic polyposis are related with germline mutation of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, that is also responsible for a wide number of extracolonic manifestations. Concerning severity of polyposis, it has been suggested to perform ileorectal anastomosis in patients with intermediate FAP, whereas it has been suggested to remove the rectum from the beginning and to perform ileopouch anastomosis in patients with severe FAP (germline APC mutations between codons 1250 and 1464, i.e. mutation cluster region-MCR). Concerning extracolonic manifestations, original studies from our laboratory have shown that three peculiar, even if unusual extracolonic manifestations of FAP, were in the 5' portion of the gene, but almost always outside of MCR. In particular, in some patients or in some kindreds all these manifestations may be present together. It is suggested, from one hand, because of the wide variety of genotype-phenotype correlation word of caution before selecting surgical treatment simply on the basis of the germline mutations, on the other hand co-segregation of some extracolonic manifestations could facilitate intensive screening, early diagnosis and optimal time for treatment.",M1
17989230,"Alpha-catenin is essential in intestinal adenoma formation.A loss-of-function mutation in the APC gene initiates colorectal carcinogenesis. Although the molecular mechanism of tumor initiation is complex, several modifier genes have been identified using mouse models, including the ApcMin mouse. Among the <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> mouse lines carrying a truncation mutation at codon 580 in Apc (Apc580D), one line (line19-Apc(580D/+)) showed a remarkably reduced incidence of intestinal adenomas (&lt;5% compared with other lines). Extensive genetic analysis identified a deletion in the alpha-catenin (Ctnna1) gene as the cause of this suppression. Notably, the suppression only occurred when the Ctnna1 deletion was in cis-configuration with the Apc580D mutation. In all adenomas generated in line19-Apc(580D/+), somatic recombination between the Apc and Ctnna1 loci retained the wild-type Ctnna1 allele. These data strongly indicate that simultaneous inactivation of alpha-catenin and Apc during tumor initiation suppresses adenoma formation in line19-Apc(580D/+), suggesting that alpha-catenin plays an essential role in the initiation of intestinal adenomas. Although accumulating evidence obtained from human colon tumors with invasive or metastatic potential has established a tumor-suppressive role for alpha-catenin in late-stage tumorigenesis, the role of alpha-catenin in the initiation of intestinal tumorigenesis is not well documented, especially compared with that of beta-catenin. A mouse model used in this study focused on the early stage of tumor initiation and clearly indicated an essential role for alpha-catenin. Thus, alpha-catenin has dual roles in intestinal tumorigenesis, a supporting role in tumor initiation, and a suppressive role in tumor progression.",M1
17962810,"Sporadic childhood hepatoblastomas show activation of beta-catenin, mismatch repair defects and p53 mutations.Hepatoblastoma, a rare embryonic tumor that may arise sporadically or in the context of hereditary syndromes (<e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and Beckwith-Wiedemann's) is the most frequent liver cancer of childhood. Deregulation of the APC/beta-catenin pathway occurs in a consistent fraction of hepatoblastomas, with mutations in the APC and beta-catenin genes implicated in familial adenomatous polyposis-associated and sporadic hepatoblastomas, respectively. Alterations in other cancer-related molecular pathways have not been reported. We investigated a series of 21 sporadic paraffin-embedded hepatoblastoma cases for mutations in the p53 (exons 5-8) and beta-catenin (exon 3) genes, loss of heterozygosity at APC, microsatellite instability and immunohistochemical expression of beta-catenin and of the two main mismatch repair proteins, MLH1 and MSH2. No loss of heterozygosity at APC was detected. We found mutations in beta-catenin and p53 in 4/21 (19%) and 5/21 (24%) cases respectively, beta-catenin protein accumulation in 14/21 cases (67%), microsatellite instability in 17/21 cases (81%), of which eight resulted positive for high-level of microsatellite instability (in four cases associated with loss of MLH1/MSH2 immunostaining). No correlations between involved molecular pathway(s) and hepatoblastoma histotype(s) emerged. This study confirms that beta-catenin deregulation is involved in sporadic hepatoblastoma and also suggests that mismatch repair defects and p53 mutations contribute to this rare liver cancer. Sporadic hepatoblastoma appears to be molecularly and phenotypically heterogeneous and may reflect different pathways of liver carcinogenesis.",M1
17903035,"X radiation up-regulates the occurrence and the multiplicity of invasive carcinomas in the intestinal tract of Apc(min/+) mice.X rays are well known to cause genetic damage and to induce many types of carcinomas in humans. The Apc(min/+) mouse, an animal model for human <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP), contains a truncating mutation in the APC gene and spontaneously develops intestinal adenomas. To elucidate the role of X rays in the development of intestinal tumors, we examined the promotion of carcinogenesis in X-irradiated Apc(min/+) mice. Forty out of 77 (52%) X-irradiated Apc(min/+) mice developed adenocarcinomas that invaded the proprial muscle layer of the small intestine; 24 of 44 (55%) were in males, and 16 of 33 (49%) were in females. In contrast, invasive carcinomas were detected in the small intestines of only 13 of 64 (20%) nonirradiated Apc(min/+) mice; nine of 32 (28%) were in males and four of 32 (13%) were in females. These differences between X-irradiated and nonirradiated Apc(min/+) mice in the occurrence of invasive intestinal carcinomas were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05 for males, P &lt; 0.005 for females). In wild-type mice, invasive carcinomas were not detected in either X-irradiated or nonirradiated mice. Apc(min/+) mice had many polyps in the large intestine with or without X irradiation; there was no difference in the number of polyps between the two groups. Also, invasive carcinomas were not detected in the large intestine with or without irradiation. The occurrence of mammary tumors, which was observed in Apc(min/+) mice, was found to be increased in irradiated Apc(min/+) mice (P &lt; 0.01). Apc(min/+) mice had many polyps in the small and large intestines with or without X irradiation. X-irradiated Apc(min/+) mice had highly invasive carcinomas in the small intestine with multiplicities associated with invasiveness. Our results suggest that X radiation may promote the invasive activity of intestinal tumors in Apc(min/+) mice.",M1
17854661,"How the I1307K adenomatous polyposis coli gene variant contributes in the assessment of risk of colorectal cancer, but not stomach cancer, in a Turkish population.Germline and somatic truncating mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) are thought to initiate colorectal tumor formation in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> syndrome and sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis, respectively. Recently, an isoleucine-lysine polymorphism at codon 1307 (I1307K) of the APC gene has been identified in 6-7% of the Ashkenazi Jewish population. To assess the risk of this common APC allelic variant in colorectal carcinogenesis, a cohort of unselected Turkish subjects with stomach or colorectal cancer (or both) was analyzed for the APC I1307K polymorphism. Genomic DNA was extracted from patients by obtaining all stomach and colon malign polipose tissues using nuclei lysis methods. Detection of the I1307K mutation was performed using the commercial Pronto APC kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The APC I1307K allele was identified in 7 of 57 stomach carcinoma patients (12.3%; P &gt; 0.05) and 30 of 56 colon carcinoma patients (53.6%; P &lt; 0.05) using antigen-anticor interaction methods. Comparing the frequencies of the two separate population control groups, the APC I1307K allele is associated with an estimated relative risk of 1.9 for colorectal neoplasia. Furthermore, APC I1307K carriers had greater numbers of adenomas and colorectal cancers per patient than noncarriers. The conclusion is that the APC I1307K variant leads to increased adenoma formation and colorectal cancer. The estimated relative risk for carriers may justify specific clinical screening for Turkish people expected to harbor this allele, and genetic testing in the long term may significantly promote colorectal cancer prevention in this population.",M1
17785554,"Cyclooxygenase-2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptors as potential targets in treating aggressive fibromatosis.PURPOSE: To explore the molecular bases of potential new pharmacologic targets in aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor specimens from 14 patients surgically treated for aggressive fibromatosis (6 <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and 8 sporadic cases), analyzed for adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) mutations, were further investigated for beta-catenin, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor alpha (PDGFRA)/PDGF receptor beta (PDGFRB), their cognate ligands (PDGFA and PDGFB), and KIT using a comprehensive immunohistochemical, biochemical, molecular, and cytogenetic approach. RESULTS: No CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) mutations were found in the familial adenomatous polyposis patients, but previously reported activating mutations were found in six of the eight sporadic patients. All of the cases carrying an altered WNT pathway showed nuclear and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for beta-catenin, whereas beta-catenin expression was restricted to the cytoplasm in the sporadic patients lacking CTNNB1 mutations. COX-2 protein and mRNA overexpression was detected in all 14 cases, together with the expression and phosphorylation of PDGFRA and PDGFRB, which in turn paralleled the presence of their cognate ligands. No PDGFRB mutations were found. The results are consistent with PDGFRA and PDGFRB activation sustained by an autocrine/paracrine loop. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive fibromatosis is characterized by WNT/oncogene pathway alterations triggering COX-2-mediated constitutive coactivation of PDGFRA and PDGFRB, and may therefore benefit from combined nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug + tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment.",M1
17714185,"Requirement of the tumour suppressor APC for the clustering of PSD-95 and AMPA receptors in hippocampal neurons.Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are associated with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and sporadic colorectal tumours. The APC gene is expressed ubiquitously in various tissues, especially throughout the large intestine and central nervous system (CNS). In the CNS, the expression of the APC protein is highest during embryonic and early postnatal development. APC associates through its C-terminal region with postsynaptic density (PSD)-95, a neuronal protein that participates in synapse development. Here, we examined the involvement of APC in synaptogenesis. In cultured hippocampal neurons, both overexpression of a dominant-negative construct that disrupts the APC-PSD-95 interaction and knockdown of APC expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited the clustering of PSD-95 and a glutamate receptor subunit, and reduced alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA)-induced activity of AMPA receptors; however, the clustering of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit was unaffected. These results are suggestive of APC involvement in the development of glutamatergic synapses.",M1
17572842,"Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) plays multiple roles in the intestinal and colorectal epithelia.The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is mutated in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and in most sporadic colorectal tumors. During both embryonic and postnatal periods, APC is widely expressed in a variety of tissues, including the brain and gastrointestinal tract. The APC gene product (APC) is a large multidomain protein consisting of 2843 amino acids. APC downregulates the Wnt signaling pathway through its binding to beta-catenin and Axin. Most mutated APC proteins in colorectal tumors lack the beta-catenin-binding regions and fail to inhibit Wnt signaling, leading to the overproliferation of tumor cells. Several mouse models (APC580D, APCDelta716, APC1309, APCMin, APC1638T) have been established to investigate carcinogenesis caused by APC mutations. APC also binds to APC-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor, the kinesin superfamily-associated protein 3, IQGAP1, microtubules, EB1, and discs large (DLG). APC has both nuclear localization signals and nuclear export signals in its molecule, suggesting its occasional nuclear localization and export of beta-catenin from the nucleus. APC is highly expressed in the intestinal and colorectal epithelia and may be involved in homeostasis of the enterocyte renewal phenomena, in which proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis are highly regulated both temporally and spatially. Through the many binding proteins mentioned, APC can exert multiple functions involved in epithelial homeostasis.",M1
17483318,"Development of gastric tumors in Apc(Min/+) mice by the activation of the beta-catenin/Tcf signaling pathway.Although several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of the Wnt pathway in the development of gastric cancers, the functional significance of the pathway in gastric carcinogenesis is still poorly defined. To examine the role of the Apc/beta-catenin signaling pathway in the development of gastric cancers, we investigated the gastric mucosa of the Apc(Min/+) mouse, which is a murine model for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, carrying a germ-line mutation at codon 850 of Apc. We found that aged Apc(Min/+) mice spontaneously develop multiple tumors in the stomach, which are accompanied by loss of heterozygosity of Apc. Such tumors consisted of adenomatous glands with strong nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin. Even a single adenomatous gland already showed nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, suggesting that Apc/beta-catenin pathway is an initiating event in gastric tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice. Myc and cyclin D1 expressions, which are transcriptional targets of beta-catenin/Tcf, increased in the adenomatous lesions. Furthermore, beta-catenin/Tcf reporter transgenic mice with Apc(Min) allele showed higher levels of the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin/Tcf in the gastric tumors. We also treated Apc(Min/+) and wild-type mice with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), an alkylating agent that induces adenomas and adenocarcinomas in the stomach. Consequently, MNU-treated Apc(Min/+) mice significantly enhanced the tumor development in comparison with Apc(Min/+) mice or MNU-treated wild-type mice. Several gastric tumors in MNU-treated Apc(Min/+) mice showed invasion into the submucosal layer. These results indicate that the Apc/beta-catenin pathway may play an important role in at least subset of gastric carcinomas. In addition, Apc(Min/+) mice combined with MNU could be a useful short-term model to investigate multistage carcinogenesis in the stomach.",M1
17360473,"A target-selected Apc-mutant rat kindred enhances the modeling of familial human colon cancer.Progress toward the understanding and management of human colon cancer can be significantly advanced if appropriate experimental platforms become available. We have investigated whether a rat model carrying a knockout allele in the gatekeeper gene Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) recapitulates familial colon cancer of the human more closely than existing murine models. We have established a mutagen-induced nonsense allele of the rat Apc gene on an inbred F344/NTac (F344) genetic background. Carriers of this mutant allele develop multiple neoplasms with a distribution between the colon and small intestine that closely simulates that found in human <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> patients. To distinguish this phenotype from the predominantly small intestinal phenotype found in most Apc-mutant mouse strains, this strain has been designated the polyposis in the rat colon (Pirc) kindred. The Pirc rat kindred provides several unique and favorable features for the study of colon cancer. Tumor-bearing Pirc rats can live at least 17 months, carrying a significant colonic tumor burden. These tumors can be imaged both by micro computed tomography scanning and by classical endoscopy, enabling longitudinal studies of tumor genotype and phenotype as a function of response to chemopreventive and therapeutic regimes. The metacentric character of the rat karyotype, like that of the human and unlike the acrocentric mouse, has enabled us to demonstrate that the loss of the wild-type Apc allele in tumors does not involve chromosome loss. We believe that the Pirc rat kindred can address many of the current gaps in the modeling of human colon cancer.",M1
17160434,"Familial colorectal cancer referral to regional genetics department--a single centre experience.Evaluation of familial colorectal cancer referral can assist in the planning of future cancer surveillance. The aim of the study is to assess colorectal cancer referral pattern to our regional genetics service. Hospital computer records and/or department referral books were used to identify cases referred to the regional genetic service during a 10-year period (1992-2001 inclusive). All files were reviewed along with associated demographic data, risk assessments, referral details, results from mutation testing and screening recommendations. In terms of result, a total of 1100 family files were reviewed (<e>Familial Adenomatous Polyposis</e> families were in a separate register). The number of referrals showed a 10-fold increase over the 10 years. 171 (15.6%) of families met the Amsterdam criteria II were classified as high-risk, 589 (53.5%) families were classified as moderate-risk and 337 (31.0%) as average or low risk. 22.9% families were referred with inaccurate cancer history. Sixty-one families have been identified with mismatch repair mutations. 56.8% of referred individuals were recommended to have regular colonoscopy ranging from 18 monthly to 5 yearly depending on their risks. In conclusion, there has been a 10-fold increase in individuals with suspected hereditary bowel cancer referred to the North West Regional Genetics Service in the last ten years. Genetic assessment may reduce the number of low-risk individuals and those who were found not to be mutation carriers from having unnecessary colonoscopic screening. Thus genetic risk assessment should precede the initiation of regular endoscopic screening.",M1
17106247,"Role of c-Myc in intestinal tumorigenesis of the ApcMin/+ mouse.The c-MYC oncogene plays an important role in tumorigenesis and is commonly highly expressed in gastrointestinal cancers. In colon cells, c-MYC is regulated by the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) tumor suppressor gene. Multiple intestinal neoplasia (ApcMin/+ or Min) mice are heterozygous for a truncating Apc mutation and serve as a model of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) disease. To study the role of c-Myc in the mutant Apc-mediated colon tumorigenesis, we have developed a transgenic mouse with the conditional deletion of the floxed c-Myc alleles in the intestinal crypts of ApcMin/+ mice (ApcMin/+; c-Mycfl/fl). The floxed c-Myc deletion was initiated via a Cre recombinase controlled by the intestine-specific transcriptional regulatory elements of the liver fatty acid-binding protein gene (Fabpl4xat-132). Fabpl4xat-132-mediated Cre expression and recombination resulted in a two-fold decrease in c-MYC protein expression with no effect on intestinal tract morphology. Small intestinal tumorigenesis was significantly suppressed throughout the small intestinal tract of ApcMin/+; c-Mycfl/fl mice compared to c-Myc wild type littermates. In ApcMin/+; c-Mycfl/fl mice, the intestinal apoptosis was higher in the areas of the small intestine with the decreased c-Myc protein expression (P=0.0016, compared to their littermates with the wild type c-Myc). Thus, conditional inactivation of c-Myc, mediated by Fabpl4xat-132-driven Cre-recombinase, suppresses Apc-dependent intestinal tumorigenesis in adult ApcMin/+ mice, without apparent effect on normal intestinal mucosa.",M1
17052257,"Multistep carcinogenesis of the colon in Apc(Min/+) mouse.Colon cancer arises through different histological stages representing different genetic and epigenetic alterations. The Apc(Min/+) mouse has a point mutation at the Apc gene, and it is considered to be a model for human <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. Our previous studies have revealed the presence of a number of intramucosal microadenomas in the colons of Apc(Min/+) mice, in which only a few macroscopic tumors were recognized. These observations suggest that there are two distinct stages for colon carcinogenesis in Apc(Min/+) mouse, and the Apc(Min/+) mouse is regarded as a good model to study multistage colon carcinogenesis. A number of genes that modify intestinal tumorigenesis have been identified using Apc mutant mice combined with other mutant mice. It has become apparent that epigenetic modification strongly affects intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice. We herein describe the different stages of colon tumorigenesis and their modifiers, and discuss the possible application of Apc mutant mice in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms of multistage carcinogenesis in the large bowel of humans.",M1
16862550,"Prolactinoma as the first manifestation of Gardner's syndrome.<e>Familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) is an inherited condition causing numerous adenomatous colorectal polyps and a markedly elevated risk of colon cancer. FAP may be associated with various extracolonic manifestations such as desmoid fibromatosis and osteomas (termed Gardner's syndrome) and brain tumors, usually medulloblastoma or glioma [termed Brain Tumor Polyposis (BTP) syndrome type 2]. We describe a pediatric patient who initially presented with prolactinoma and later was found to have Gardner's syndrome. A germline mutation of the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene was identified. Our case illustrates the association between prolactinoma and FAP, which may represent a rare subtype of Gardner's and BTP syndromes.",M1
16606335,"Concomitant suppression of hyperlipidemia and intestinal polyp formation by increasing lipoprotein lipase activity in Apc-deficient mice.Epidemiologically, a high-fat diet is associated with the risk of colon cancer. In addition, serum levels of triglycerides (TGs) and cholesterol have been demonstrated to be positively associated with colon carcinogenesis. We recently found that an age-dependent hyperlipidemic state (high serum TG levels) exists in Apc-deficient mice, an animal model for human <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. The mRNA levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which catalyzes TG hydrolysis, were shown to be downregulated in the liver and intestines of mice. Moreover, treatment with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha agonist, bezafibrate, or a PPARgamma agonist, pioglitazone, suppressed both hyperlipidemia and intestinal polyp formation in the mice, with induction of LPL mRNA. PPARalpha and PPARgamma agonists are reported to exert anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in cancer cells. One compound that also increases LPL expression levels but does not possess PPAR agnostic activity is NO-1886. When given at 400 or 800 ppm in the diet, it suppresses both hyperlipidemia and intestinal polyp formation in Apc-deficient mice, with elevation of LPL mRNA. In conclusion, a decrease in serum lipid levels by increasing LPL activity may contribute to a reduction in intestinal polyp formation with Apc deficiency. PPARalpha and PPARgamma agonists, as well as NO-1886, could be useful as chemopreventive agents for colon cancer.",M1
16309164,"Increased levels of PPARbeta/delta and cyclin D1 in flat dysplastic ACF and adenomas in Apc(Min/+) mice.BACKGROUND: In Apc(Min/+) (Min; multiple intestinal neoplasia) mice two separate populations of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) develop in the colon after azoxymethane (AOM) exposure. ACF(Min), with a flat appearance, severe dysplasia and increased beta-catenin expression, are related to adenoma development, whereas classic ACF, with elevated structure, hyperplasia and normal beta-catenin level, are probably not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) beta/delta, cyclin D1 and beta-catenin in ACF, adenoma and normal tissue from AOM-treated Apc(Min/+) mice and a <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) patient colon tumour were assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. RESULTS: The flat ACF (ACF(Min)) displayed increased cytoplasmic levels of beta-catenin, and increased levels of cyclin D1 and PPARbeta/delta. In contrast, the expression in classic ACF resembled normal mucosa. Adenomas from Apc(Min/+) mice, as well as a FAP patient colon tumour, displayed increased nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of beta-catenin, and the same expression patterns of cyclin D1 and PPARbeta/delta as those found in flat ACF. CONCLUSION: In addition to activation of the Wnt signalling pathway in both flat ACF and in adenomas in Apc(Min/+) mice, the increased expression of PPARbeta/delta in these lesions could be a target for pro-inflammatory signals important for growth and reduced apoptosis.",M1
16204028,"The threshold level of adenomatous polyposis coli protein for mouse intestinal tumorigenesis.The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, whose mutations are responsible for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, is a major negative controller of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. To investigate the dose-dependent effects of APC protein in suppressing intestinal tumorigenesis, we constructed mutant mice carrying hypomorphic Apc alleles Apc(neoR) and Apc(neoF) whose expression levels were reduced to 20% and 10% of the wild type, respectively. Although both hypomorphic heterozygotes developed intestinal polyps, tumor multiplicities were much lower than that in Apc(Delta716) mice, heterozygotes of an Apc null allele. Like in Apc(Delta716) mice, loss of the wild-type Apc allele was confirmed for all polyps examined in the Apc(neoR) and Apc(neoF) mice. In the embryonic stem cells homozygous for these hypomorphic Apc alleles, the level of the APC protein was inversely correlated with both the beta-catenin accumulation and beta-catenin/T-cell factor transcriptional activity. These results suggest that the reduced APC protein level increases intestinal polyp multiplicity through quantitative stimulation of the beta-catenin/T-cell factor transcription. We further estimated the threshold of APC protein level that forms one polyp per mouse as approximately 15% of the wild type. These results also suggest therapeutic implications concerning Wnt signaling inhibitors.",M1
16049979,"Dextran sodium sulfate strongly promotes colorectal carcinogenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice: inflammatory stimuli by dextran sodium sulfate results in development of multiple colonic neoplasms.The mouse model for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, Apc(Min/+) mouse, contains a truncating mutation in the Apc gene and spontaneously develops numerous adenomas in the small intestine but few in the large bowel. Our study investigated whether dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment promotes the development of colonic neoplasms in Apc(Min/+) mice. Apc(Min/+) and Apc+/+ mice of both sexes were exposed to 2% dextran sodium sulfate in drinking water for 7 days, followed by no further treatment for 4 weeks. Immunohistochemistry for cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, beta-catenin, p53, and nitrotyrosine, and mutations of beta-catenin and K-ras and loss of wild-type allele of the Apc gene in the colonic lesions were examined. Sequential observation of female Apc(Min/+) mice that received DSS was also performed up to week 5. At week 5, numerous colonic neoplasms developed in male and female Apc(Min/+) mice but did not develop in Apc+/+ mice. Adenocarcinomas developed in Apc(Min/+) mice that received DSS showed loss of heterozygosity of Apc and no mutations in the beta-catenin and K-ras genes. The treatment also significantly increased the number of small intestinal polyps. Sequential observation revealed increase in the incidences of colonic neoplasms and dysplastic crypts in female Apc(Min/+) mice given DSS. DSS treatment increased inflammation scores, associated with high intensity staining of beta-catenin, cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitrotyrosine. Interestingly, strong nuclear staining of p53 was specifically observed in colonic lesions of Apc(Min/+) mice treated with DSS. Our results suggest a strong promotion effect of DSS in the intestinal carcinogenesis of Apc(Min/+) mice. The findings also suggest that strong oxidative/nitrosative stress caused by DSS-induced inflammation may contribute to the colonic neoplasms development.",M1

15520370,"Multiple rare variants in different genes account for multifactorial inherited susceptibility to colorectal adenomas.Clear-cut inherited Mendelian traits, such as <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, account for &lt;4% of colorectal cancers. Another 20% of all colorectal cancers are thought to occur in individuals with a significant inherited multifactorial susceptibility to colorectal cancer that is not obviously familial. Incompletely penetrant, comparatively rare missense variants in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene, which is responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis, have been described in patients with multiple colorectal adenomas. These variants represent a category of variation that has been suggested, quite generally, to account for a substantial fraction of such multifactorial inherited susceptibility. The aim of this study was to explore this rare variant hypothesis for multifactorial inheritance by using multiple colorectal adenomas as the model. Patients with multiple adenomas were screened for germ-line variants in a panel of candidate genes. Germ-line DNA was obtained from 124 patients with between 3 and 100 histologically proven synchronous or metachronous adenomatous polyps. All patients were tested for the adenomatous polyposis coli variants I1307K and E1317Q, and variants were also sought in AXIN1 (axin), CTNNB1 (beta-catenin), and the mismatch repair genes hMLH1 and hMSH2. The control group consisted of 483 random controls. Thirty of 124 (24.9%) patients carried potentially pathogenic germ-line variants as compared with 55 ( approximately 12%) of the controls. This overall difference is highly significant, suggesting that many rare variants collectively contribute to the inherited susceptibility to colorectal adenomas.",M1
15502862,"Colorectal cancers in a new mouse model of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>: influence of genetic and environmental modifiers.Murine models of familial adenomatous polyposis harbor a germinal heterozygous mutation on Apc tumor suppressor gene. They are valuable tools for studying intestinal carcinogenesis, as most human sporadic cancers contain inactivating mutations of APC. However, Apc(+/-) mice, such as the well-characterized Apc(Min/+) model, develop cancers principally in the small intestine, while humans develop mainly colorectal cancers. We used a Cre-loxP strategy to achieve a new model of germline Apc invalidation in which exon 14 is deleted. We compared the phenotype of these Apc(Delta14/+) mice to that of the classical Apc(Min/+). The main phenotypic difference is the shift of the tumors in the distal colon and rectum, often associated with a rectal prolapse. Thus, the severity of the colorectal phenotype is partly due to the particular mutation Delta14, but also to environmental parameters, as mice raised in conventional conditions developed more colon cancers than those raised in pathogen-free conditions. All lesions, including early lesions, revealed Apc LOH and loss of Apc gene expression. They accumulated beta-catenin, overexpressed the beta-catenin target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc, and the distribution pattern of glutamine synthetase, a beta-catenin target gene recently identified in the liver, was mosaic in intestinal adenomas. The Apc(Delta14/+) model is thus a useful new tool for studies on the molecular mechanisms of colorectal tumorigenesis.",M1
15387442,"Quality assessment in cytogenetic and molecular genetic testing: the experience of the Italian Project on Standardisation and Quality Assurance.The first Italian national trial of external quality assessment in genetic testing was organised within the framework of the  Italian National Project for Standardisation and Quality Assurance of Genetic Tests . Sixty-eight Public Health Service laboratories volunteered for the trial, which involved molecular genetic tests (cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassaemia, <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> coli and fragile-X syndrome) and cytogenetic tests (prenatal and postnatal, the latter included cancer cytogenetics). The response rate was high (88.2%). The level of analytical accuracy was good, i.e., the percentage of laboratories that correctly genotyped all samples was 89.3% for cystic fibrosis, 90.9% for beta-thalassaemia, 100% for familial adenomatous polyposis coli (despite two laboratories did not complete the analysis because the amount of DNA was considered insufficient), and 90.5% for fragile-X syndrome. Written reports differed widely and were judged  inadequate  in over 50% of cases. Most laboratories from the present study already have experience in previous European external quality assessments for at least one genetic test; this can explain the higher analytical accuracy in the Italian external quality assessment with respect to quality control programmes in other countries. Collaborative networks are strongly suggested to improve the quality of the reports.",M1
15218453,"Alternative splicing of the APC gene in the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium.PURPOSE: Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is associated with an inherited predisposition to human <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> coli, suggesting that expression of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor may regulate RPE proliferation/differentiation. Distinctive APC isoforms exist in different cell types due to alternative splicing of the APC transcripts. We hypothesize that differences in expression patterns of APC protein isoforms are critical to RPE proliferation/differentiation. METHODS: To investigate these relationships, APC gene expression was characterized in the retinas and RPE from fetal and adult human and mouse, and in the epiretinal membranes (ERM) from 5 patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Expression patterns of alternative splice-forms of APC transcripts were evaluated by comparative quantitative RT-PCR. Exon 1 of APC encodes a heptad repeat that confers the ability of APC to homodimerize. APC protein isoforms containing or lacking this heptad were characterized by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Comparative quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated a predominant exon 1 containing, conventional APC splice-form in the early developing fetal RPE and retina, and in all the tested ERM samples from patients with PVR. This method also demonstrated an increased level of exon 1 lacking APC splice-form in the mature RPE and retina. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated the conventional APC only in the RPE, and the APC isoform without the first heptad repeat in both the retina and RPE. Immunofluorescence microscopy also demonstrated only the conventional APC in the ERM samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that alternative splicing of APC leads to differential APC expression with potentially unique functions. APC isoform without the first heptad repeat may play a role in cell cycle cessation in the adult retina and RPE, and the down regulation of this APC isoform may contribute to the potential of RPE to migrate and proliferate.",M1
15122587,"Definition of candidate low risk APC alleles in a Swedish population.Many families experience an apparently inherited increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) similar to the known syndromes <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Besides these high-risk syndromes, approximately 10% of all CRC cases come from families with 2 affected 1st-degree relatives, and even 1st-degree relatives to a single case of CRC are at increased risk. Risk subjects from these families frequently show polyps at colonoscopy, which suggests the APC gene as a good candidate susceptibility gene for these attenuated polypotic syndromes. We used the sensitive DHPLC technique to search for possible predisposing germline mutations in the entire APC gene in 91 risk subjects from these high- and low-risk syndromes with unknown predisposing genes. Most exons were also screened for mutations in 96 normal controls and 96 colorectal cancer cases. In our study we probably have identified the most common APC variants in a Swedish population. Among 30 germline variants identified, 1 clearly pathogenic nonsense mutation and 11 putative pathogenic variants (10 missense and one 3' UTR) were found in 20 index patients (22%). Twelve silent as well as 5 intronic variants were considered nonpathogenic. Two of the missense variants found here, E1317Q and D1822V, have previously been related to a difference in risk of colorectal cancer. One variant, 8636C&gt;A, located within the 3' UTR region of the APC gene, was suggested to constitute an additional low risk allele with a similar relative risk as the Jewish I1307K mutation (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 0.96-3.40). The question of whether all the other variants confer an increased colorectal cancer risk warrants future large association studies.",M1
15087381,"Promoter methylation inhibits APC gene expression by causing changes in chromatin conformation and interfering with the binding of transcription factor CCAAT-binding factor.As an important regulator in Wnt-signaling pathway, the APC gene is involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The loss of APC function is observed in most <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>-associated and sporadic colorectal cancer. APC gene is frequently inactivated by DNA mutations. However, hypermethylation in APC gene promoter was also observed in different cancers. In this study, by analyzing the methylation status of APC promoter in 22 colorectal cancer cell lines with different APC expression levels, we identified Regions A and B in the promoter, where the methylation of CpG sites was invariably correlated with the loss of gene expression. By nuclease accessibility assay, we also observed a correlation between the closed chromatin conformation in APC promoter and loss of gene expression. When the nonexpressing cell lines were treated with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-Aza-2'-Deoxycytidine, the APC expression in these cells was induced, CpG sites were demethylated, and closed chromatin conformation was opened. However, when these cell lines were treated with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A, no significant changes in APC expression, methylation status, and chromatin conformation were observed. Using transient transfection assay, a CCAAT box located in Region B was identified, which was involved in up-regulation of APC expression. Methylation of CpG sites around the CCAAT box resulted in a significant inhibition in the gene expression. The specific binding of a transcription factor CCAAT-binding factor (CBF) to the CCAAT box was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. The binding was inhibited after CpG sites close to the CCAAT box were methylated, indicating that DNA methylation can silence gene expression through interfering with the binding of transcription factors to the promoter. The biological function of CBF in APC gene regulation was further indicated by the decrease of luciferase activities in cells cotransfected with a plasmid carrying APC promoter/luciferase gene and a plasmid expressing dominant negative CBF mutant. In summary, methylation of CpG sites around CCAAT box in APC promoter inhibits the gene expression by changing the chromatin conformation and interfering with the binding of transcription factor CBF to CCAAT box.",M1
14713549,"Promotion of colon tumors in C57BL/6J-APC(min)/+ mice by thiazolidinedione PPARgamma agonists and a structurally unrelated PPARgamma agonist.Thiazolidinedione PPARgamma agonists (troglitazone and rosiglitazone) were previously shown to promote colon tumor formation in C57BL/6J-APC(min)/+ mice, a model for human <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. This study was conducted to determine if another thiazolidinedione PPARgamma agonist, pioglitazone, and a PPARgamma agonist structurally unrelated to the thiazolidinedione family, NID525, (a tetrazole-substituted phenoxymethylquinolone), would also promote colon tumors in this mouse model. Mice were treated in-feed with the thiazolidinediones troglitazone (150 mg/kg/day), rosiglitazone (20 mg/kg/day), or pioglitazone (150 mg/kg/day), or with NID525 (150 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. An increased incidence in colon tumors compared to controls was observed for all of the thiazolidinedione-treated groups as well as the NID525-treated group. These results indicate that the tumor-promoting effect of PPARgamma agonists in the colon of C57BL/6J-APC(min)/+ mice is likely related to the pharmacological activity of this group of drugs and not the thiazolidinedione structure.",M1
14616385,"The concomitant occurrence of multiple epidermal cysts, osteomas and thyroid gland nodules is not diagnostic for Gardner syndrome in the absence of intestinal polyposis: a clinical and genetic report.Gardner syndrome, a phenotypic variant of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, is characterized by the classical clinical triad of skin and soft tissue tumours, osteomas and intestinal polyposis, but disease patterns with pairs of these findings have also been reported. Different mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene have been shown to be associated with Gardner syndrome disease phenotypes. A 36-year-old patient presented with multiple epidermal cysts on the face, left ear lobe and neck, and the possible diagnosis of Gardner syndrome was based on the additional findings of two classical osteomas in the left radius and ulna and a cold non-malignant nodule of the thyroid gland. Intestinal polyposis was lacking at the time of examination. Major deletions but not microdeletions were excluded by a cytogenetic analysis with 650 chromosomal bands per haploid set. Systematic sequencing of the entire coding region of the APC gene (&gt; 8500 bp) of the patient and five healthy controls was also performed. As a results, new APC gene polymorphisms were identified in exons 13 [A545A (A/G)] and 15 [G1678G (A/G), S1756S (G/T), P1960P (A/G)]. We also detected D1822V (A/T) which has recently been reported to be potentially related to colorectal carcinoma, and genotyped 194 randomly chosen healthy individuals from the Glasgow area for this as well as for the above variants in exons 13 and 15. Interestingly, of the 194 controls, 112 carried the DD (57.7%), 71 the DV (36.6%), and the remaining 11 (5.7%), including our patient, the VV genotype. It is therefore unlikely that APC D1822V serves as an important marker for colorectal carcinoma. In conclusion, we failed to identify obvious germline candidate mutations in &gt; 8500 bp of the coding region of the APC gene in a patient with multiple epidermal cysts, osteomas and a thyroid gland nodule; major chromosomal deletions were excluded. Therefore, we assume that only the presence of intestinal polyposis is a marker for Gardner syndrome.",M1
14578138,"The APC E1317Q variant in adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancers.Genetic susceptibility may play a role in many colorectal cancers (CRCs). Known syndromes such as <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and hereditary nonpolyposis CRC account for &lt;5% of CRCs. The germ-line missense variant of the APC gene, E1317Q, has been proposed to confer a risk for colonic adenomatous polyps (adenomas), but not for CRCs in the general population. These findings are contradictory and controversial. In the present study, 608 cases (377 patients with CRC, 145 patients with 4-100 lifetime adenomas, and 86 with &lt; or =3 lifetime adenomas), and 679 controls (362 spouses and 317 patients with normal colonoscopy) were screened for the APC E1317Q variant. The frequency of heterozygotes for E1317Q among patients with CRC (2.4%), patients with 4-100 adenomas (1.4%), and &lt; or =3 adenomas (3.5%) did not differ from spouse controls (2.8%). When CRC patients were examined by DNA mismatch repair status, age at onset (&lt; or =age 50 versus &gt;50), or family history of CRC, no differences in the frequency of E1317Q were found. The APC variant E1317Q does not appear to be associated with increased risk for colorectal neoplasia in the general population. However, when we used normal colonoscopy controls (E1317Q carrier frequency = 0.3%), the prevalence of E1317Q was significantly increased in CRC patients, in patients with &lt; or =3 adenomas, and in CRC patients with intact mismatch repair status, suggesting a possible role for E1317Q in colorectal tumorigenesis. These results underscore the importance of carefully defining the controls to be used in comparisons of allele frequencies.",M1
14531526,"Dysplasia in fundic gland polyps is associated with nuclear beta-catenin expression and relatively high cell turnover rates.BACKGROUND: Fundic gland polyps (FGPs) occur in both syndromic and sporadic form. Syndromic FGPs arise through mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, whereas sporadic FGPs are caused by beta-catenin gene mutations. Dysplasia in sporadic FGPs, found less often than in syndromic FGPs, was recently associated with APC rather than beta-catenin mutations. These data suggest different functional consequences of APC and beta-catenin mutations. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined proliferative activity, degree of apoptosis, beta-catenin expression and p53 expression in syndromic and sporadic FGPs. METHODS: Syndromic FGPs (n = 9) from <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) patients and sporadic FGPs (n = 18) were studied. Proliferative activity, apoptotic cell death and expression of beta-catenin and p53 were examined by immunohistochemistry. In FGPs containing dysplasia, areas with and without dysplasia were compared. RESULTS: Syndromic and sporadic FGPs without dysplasia exhibited similar proliferative activity, degree of apoptosis, beta-catenin and p53 expression. Dysplasia was observed more often in syndromic (4/9) than in sporadic FGPs (1/18). Within FGPs containing dysplasia, dysplastic areas showed abnormal nuclear beta-catenin staining in 3/5 cases and higher rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis than non-dysplastic areas. Overexpression of p53 was not observed. CONCLUSION: The finding of similar rates of proliferation and apoptosis in syndromic and sporadic FGPs does not support the hypothesis that APC and beta-catenin gene mutations have different functional consequences in FGPs. The association of dysplasia with relatively high cell turnover rates and nuclear expression of beta-catenin indicates activation of the Wnt-APC-beta-catenin pathway in dysplasia. The finding of dysplasia in some but not all syndromic FGPs suggests the involvement of other genes in addition to the APC gene in the development of dysplasia in FGPs.",M1
14522940,"Concomitant suppression of hyperlipidemia and intestinal polyp formation in Apc-deficient mice by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligands.Epidemiological studies have shown a positive association of colon cancer with hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, signaling generated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and gamma ligands, suggested to be candidate tumor preventive agents, has been shown to lower serum triglyceride levels. In the present study, we assessed hyperlipidemia in Apc-deficient mice, model animals for human <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, and examined the effects of pioglitazone and bezafibrate, respectively, PPARgamma and PPARalpha agonists, on both hyperlipidemia and intestinal polyposis. Serum lipid levels in Apc(1309) mice and Min mice from 6 to 15 weeks of age were measured. Although serum levels of triglyceride and cholesterol were low in both Apc(1309) and wild-type mice at 6 weeks, triglycerides were elevated 10-fold in Apc(1309) mice by the age of 12 weeks but not in their wild-type counterparts. Cholesterol was also increased significantly, and marked centrilobular-restricted steatosis was observed in the livers of aged Apc(1309) mice. Similar findings were observed for Min mice at 15 weeks of age. Moreover, lipoprotein lipase mRNA levels in the liver and small intestine of Apc(1309) and Min mice were demonstrated to be lower than those in wild-type mice. Treatment of Apc(1309) mice with 100 and 200 ppm pioglitazone or bezafibrate for 6 weeks from 6 weeks of age caused dose-dependent reduction in serum triglycerides and cholesterol, along with reduction in the numbers of intestinal polyps to 67% of the control value. The present study clearly demonstrated a hyperlipidemic state in Apc gene-deficient mice and a potential of PPARalpha and PPARgamma ligands to suppress both hyperlipidemia and polyp formation. Hyperlipidemia in these mice may thus be associated with their intestinal lesion development.",M1

12778080,"Age-related difference in susceptibility of Apc(Min/+) mice towards the chemopreventive efficacy of dietary aspirin and curcumin.The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin and the spice curcumin retard adenoma formation when administered long-term to Apc(Min/+) mice, a model of human <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> coli. Both agents interfere with cyclooxygenase activity. When aspirin is administered to Apc(Min/+) mice only postweaning, but not before, it is inefficacious, while curcumin given postweaning is active. Here the hypothesis was tested that dietary aspirin (0.05%) or curcumin (0.2%) prevent or delay adenoma formation in offsprings when administered to Apc(Min/+) mothers and up to the end of weaning, but not afterwards. Whereas curcumin was without effect when administered in this way, aspirin reduced numbers of intestinal adenomas by 21%. When aspirin given up to the end of weaning was combined with curcumin administered from the end of weaning for the rest of the animals' lifetime, intestinal adenoma numbers were reduced by 38%. The combination was not superior to intervention postweaning with curcumin alone. These results show that aspirin exerts chemopreventive activity in the Apc(Min/+) mouse during tumour initiation/early promotion, while curcumin is efficacious when given at a later stage of carcinogenic progression. Thus, the results suggest that in this mouse model aspirin and curcumin act during different 'windows' of neoplastic development.",M1
12663524,"Regional response leading to tumorigenesis after sulindac in small and large intestine of mice with Apc mutations.Sulindac and other NSAIDs have been widely studied as potential chemopreventive agents for colon cancer. Short-term studies have shown adenomatous polyps to regress in patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP). In this study the effect of sulindac on cancer as an endpoint was evaluated in ApcMin mice, a preclinical model of FAP with an Apc mutation in codon 850 that leads to gastrointestinal adenomas and carcinomas. Three groups of mice were studied all of which were fed AIN-76A diet: one group was fed AIN-76A diet alone, a second group received sulindac 200 p.p.m. premixed in the diet and a third group received sulindac 180 p.p.m. added in drinking water. ApcMin mice were killed 9 weeks after feeding was initiated. Mice receiving sulindac developed fewer tumors in the intestine overall; the major decrease in tumor development after sulindac was seen in the small intestine regardless of route of administration. In the large intestine, however, sulindac significantly increased the incidence, multiplicity and volume of tumors in the colon of ApcMin mice, a regional response to sulindac differing from previous reports. Quantitative measurements of apoptosis, Bax and Bcl-xL protein expression in the ApcMin mice revealed the ratio of Bax/Bcl-xL expression and apoptosis increased in the small intestine but decreased in the cecum, consistent with the regional tumorigenesis observed after sulindac. These findings thus suggest involvement of Bax and apoptosis in tumors developing after sulindac treatment in this mouse model.",M1
12555990,"Mutation searching in colorectal cancer studies: experience with a denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography system for exon-by-exon scanning of tumour suppressor genes.AIMS: In hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) disorders such as <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, the identification of germline mutations greatly assists in the clinical management of families. In addition, study of somatic mutations in the cancers themselves (both hereditary and sporadic) has been fundamental in the elucidation of the initiation and progression of CRC. Many of the genes underlying CRC development are large; hence mutation screening is a time-consuming and labour-intensive process requiring a rapid and accurate alternative to gel-based systems such as single-strand confirmational polymorphism (SSCP) or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Here we report our progress using denaturing gradient high-pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC) in the screening of the mismatch repair genes MLH1 and MSH2 and in screening the APC and HPP1 tumour suppressor genes for mutations. METHODS: Genomic DNA was amplified using intronic primer sets spanning individual exons in the gene(s) under study. PCR products were subjected to DHPLC and the resultant chromatographs were compared with those of normal controls and aberrant peaks identified. Amplified products with aberrant peaks in the study samples underwent manual sequencing to confirm the presence of sequence variants. RESULTS: The proportion of amplified fragments showing aberrant peaks (hits) ranged from 18 to 30% and in the case of every gene, more than 80% of these could be confirmed as a sequence variant by manual sequencing. The highest rate was found in HPP1, where all hits were found to be sequence variants, and the lowest rate was found in MSH2, where manual sequencing failed to find a sequence variant in 17% of the hits attained. Mutations varied in their nature from directly truncating through splice variants to missense and deletion mutations. Traces for each mutation displayed unique shapes and both deletions and single base changes were equally dramatic. During the mutation scanning many polymorphisms presented as aberrant peaks, as would be expected. Importantly, the same polymorphism gave an identical chromatographic tracing between individuals, opening the possibility to identify common polymorphisms on pattern recognition alone. There remains, though, the possibility that rare pathogenic variants may assume an identical shape. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that DHPLC is a sensitive and efficient technique for screening of DNA for sequence variants. Given that polymorphisms comprised the largest proportion of variants found in each gene (66-100%), excluding these by pattern recognition would markedly reduce the amount of sequencing required.",M1
12486240,"Analysis of chromosomal instability in human colorectal adenomas with two mutational hits at APC.In vitro data show that the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein associates with the mitotic spindle and that mouse embryonic stem cells with biallelic Apc mutations are karyotypically unstable. These findings led to suggestions that APC acts in chromosomal segregation and that APC inactivation leads to chromosomal instability (CIN). An alternative hypothesis based on allelic loss studies in colorectal adenomas proposes that CIN precedes and contributes to genetic changes at APC. We determined whether colorectal adenomas with two mutations at APC show features consistent with these models by studying 55 lesions (average size 5 mm; range 1-13 mm) from patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. A variety of methods was used depending on available material, including flow cytometry, comparative genomic hybridization, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis. Selected adenomas were assessed for proliferative activity by Ki-67 immunocytochemistry. Seventeen of 20 (85%) tumors were diploid, two were near-diploid, and one was hypotetraploid. Just one (near-diploid) tumor showed increased proliferative activity. LOH was found occasionally on chromosome 15q (2 of 49 tumors), but not on chromosome 18q (0 of 48). In 20 adenomas, LOH at APC was associated with loss at 5q but not 5p markers, with the former encompassing a minimum of 20 Mb. However, three of these lesions analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization displayed normal profiles, suggesting, together with other data, that the mechanism of LOH at APC is probably somatic recombination. Our results therefore do not support the hypothesis that CIN precedes APC mutations in tumorigenesis. Regarding the model in which APC mutations lead directly to CIN, if APC mutations do have this effect in vivo, it must be subtle. Alternatively, CIN associated with APC mutations might be essentially an in vitro phenomenon.",M1
12420008,"Gardner's syndrome - a case report.Gardner's syndrome is the association of multiple colonic polyps (<e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> coli - FAP) with sebaceous cysts and jaw osteomas. The significance of this dominantly inherited condition to the dentist is that the colonic polyps usually undergo malignant change by the fourth decade and the extra-intestinal lesions may be apparent before those in the bowel. As such, early detection of multiple jaw osteomas and/or multiple sebaceous cysts (particularly on the scalp) may lead to appropriate further investigation and treatment which might be life saving. Diagnosis of this condition also has implications for other family members.",M1
12414520,"Sporadic fundic gland polyps with epithelial dysplasia : evidence for preferential targeting for mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene.Gastric fundic gland polyps (FGPs) occur in two distinct clinicopathological scenarios: sporadic and <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) associated. FAP-associated FGPs arise through somatic second hit alterations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and frequently demonstrate epithelial dysplasia (Am J Pathol 2000, 157:747-754). Sporadic FGPs, in contrast, tend to contain beta-catenin gene mutations and only infrequently show dysplasia (Am J Pathol 2001, 158:1005-1010). However, sporadic FGPs with dysplasia have not been previously investigated. We studied 13 sporadic FGPs with surface/foveolar low-grade dysplasia or changes indefinite for dysplasia for alterations in the APC/beta-catenin pathway, using chromosome 5q allelic loss assays and direct DNA sequencing of the mutation cluster region in exon 15 of APC and the phosphorylation region in exon 3 of beta-catenin. In addition, to evaluate for possible additional genetic alterations in FGPs, all cases were evaluated for microsatellite instability using fluorescent-based amplification of a standard panel of five microsatellite markers. Alterations in APC were present in seven (53.8%) FGPs, including two cases with bi-allelic APC inactivation (truncating intragenic mutation plus 5q allelic loss), two cases with APC mutation only, and three cases with 5q allelic loss only. In contrast, only two (15.4%) FGPs contained stabilizing beta-catenin mutations. All 13 FGPs were microsatellite stable. These results indicate that sporadic FGPs with dysplasia/indefinite for dysplasia are molecularly similar to FAP-associated FGPs, and are dissimilar to the more common sporadic nondysplastic FGPs. Mutations in APC and beta-catenin, despite occurring in the same genetic pathway, show differing biological properties, a phenomenon that has previously been demonstrated in colorectal neoplasms. The lack of microsatellite instability in FGPs in this study and of K-ras mutations in a previous study suggests that secondary genetic alterations are rare in both dysplastic and nondysplastic FGPs.",M1
12183405,"No effects of Smad2 (madh2) null mutation on malignant progression of intestinal polyps in Apc(delta716) knockout mice.The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in human chromosome 18q21 is found at high frequencies in advanced pancreatic and colorectal cancers. Several candidate tumor suppressor genes, such as SMAD2, SMAD4, and DCC, are located in this region. The homologues of these genes in the mouse are also clustered on chromosome 18. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are responsible for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, and we earlier constructed a mouse model for familial adenomatous polyposis, Apc(delta716). Although human APC is located on chromosome 5q, mouse Apc is on chromosome 18, 30 cM proximal to the Dcc-Smad4-Smad2 locus. Taking advantage of this fact, we constructed previously a cis-compound Apc(delta716) Smad4 mutant, the intestinal polyps of which progress to very invasive adenocarcinomas. To determine whether Smad2 mutations play similar roles in malignant progression, here we constructed compound mutant mice carrying Apc and Smad2 knockouts in the cis configuration. In contrast to the cis-compound Apc(delta716) Smad4 heterozygotes, the polyps in the cis-compound Apc(delta716) Smad2 heterozygotes showed no difference in the number, size, or histopathology from the polyps in the simple Apc(delta716) heterozygotes. These results suggest that, on human chromosome 18q21, the SMAD4 LOH plays a more significant role, and SMAD2 LOH is insufficient to cause malignant progression of colonic polyps.",M1
12117880,"Molecular characteristics of serrated adenomas of the colorectum.BACKGROUND: Serrated adenomas (SAs) of the colorectum combine architectural features of hyperplastic polyps and cytological features of classical adenomas. Molecular studies comparing SAs and classical adenomas suggest that each may be a distinct entity; in particular, it has been proposed that microsatellite instability (MSI) distinguishes SAs from classical adenomas and that SAs and the colorectal cancers arising from them develop along a pathway driven by low level microsatellite instability (MSI-L). AIMS: To define the molecular characteristics of SAs of the colorectum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed 39 SAs from 27 patients, including eight SAs from patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP). We screened these polyps for selected molecular changes, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH) close to APC (5q21) and CRAC1 (15q13-q22), MSI, and mutations of K-ras, APC, p53, and beta-catenin. Expression patterns of beta-catenin, p53, MLH1, MSH2, E-cadherin, and O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Comparative genomic hybridisation was performed on several polyps. RESULTS: MSI was rare (&lt;5% cases) and there was no loss of expression of mismatch repair proteins. Wnt pathway abnormalities (APC mutation/LOH, beta-catenin mutation/nuclear expression) occurred in 11 SAs, including 6/31 (19%) non-FAP tumours. CRAC1 LOH occurred in 23% of tumours. K-ras mutations and p53 mutations/overexpression were found in 15% and 8% of SAs, respectively. Loss of MGMT expression occurred in 18% of polyps and showed a borderline association with K-ras mutations. Aberrant E-cadherin expression was found in seven polyps. Comparative genomic hybridisation detected no gains or deletions of chromosomal material. CONCLUSIONS: The serrated pathway of colorectal tumorigenesis appears to be heterogeneous. In common with classical adenomas, some SAs develop along pathways involving changes in APC/beta-catenin. SAs rarely show MSI or any evidence of chromosomal-scale genetic instability. K-ras mutations may however be less common in SAs than in classical adenomas. Some SAs may harbour changes in the CRAC1 gene. Changes in known genes do not account for the growth of the majority of SAs.",M1
12034871,"Attenuated APC alleles produce functional protein from internal translation initiation.Some truncating mutations of the APC tumor suppressor gene are associated with an attenuated phenotype of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> coli (AAPC). This work demonstrates that APC alleles with 5' mutations produce APC protein that down-regulates beta-catenin, inhibits beta-catenin/T cell factor-mediated transactivation, and induces cell-cycle arrest. Transfection studies demonstrate that cap-independent translation is initiated internally at an AUG at codon 184 of APC. Furthermore, APC coding sequence between AAPC mutations and AUG 184 permits internal ribosome entry in a bicistronic vector. These data suggest that AAPC alleles in vivo may produce functional APC by internal initiation and establish a functional correlation between 5' APC mutations and their associated clinical phenotype.",M1
11978510,"The APC gene in colorectal cancer.Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are not only responsible for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP), but also play a rate-limiting role in the majority of sporadic colorectal cancers. Colorectal tumours are known to arise through a gradual series of histological changes, the so-called 'adenoma-carcinoma' sequence, each accompanied by a genetic alteration in a specific oncogene or tumour suppressor gene. Loss of APC function triggers this chain of molecular and histological changes. In general, an intestinal cell needs to comply with two essential requirements to develop into a cancer: it must acquire selective advantage to allow for the initial clonal expansion, and genetic instability to allow for multiple hits at other genes responsible for tumour progression and malignant transformation. Inactivation of APC seems to fulfill both requirements. In this short review, I will discuss the role played by APC in providing, when mutated, selective advantage, through constitutional activation of the Wnt signal transduction pathway, and chromosomal instability to the nascent intestinal tumor cell.",M1
11832455,"Detection of dysplastic intestinal adenomas using enzyme-sensing molecular beacons in mice.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Proteases play key roles in the pathogenesis of tumor growth and invasion. This study assesses the expression of cathepsin B in dysplastic adenomatous polyps. METHODS: Aged Apc(Min/+) mice served as an experimental model for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. The 4 experimental groups consisted of (a) animals injected with a novel activatable, cathepsin B sensing near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging probe; (b) animals injected with a nonspecific NIRF; (c) uninjected control animals; and (d) non-APC(Min/+) mice injected with the cathepsin B probe. Lesions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and optical imaging. RESULTS: Cathepsin B was consistently overexpressed in adenomatous polyps. When mice were injected intravenously with the cathepsin reporter probe, intestinal adenomas became highly fluorescent indicative of high cathepsin B enzyme activity. Even microscopic adenomas were readily detectable by fluorescence, but not light, imaging. The smallest lesion detectable measured 50 microm in diameter. Adenomas in the indocyanine green and/or noninjected group were only barely detectable above the background. CONCLUSIONS: The current experimental study shows that cathepsin B is up-regulated in a mouse model of adenomatous polyposis. Cathepsin B activity can be used as a biomarker to readily identify such lesions, particularly when contrasted against normal adjacent mucosa. This detection technology can be adapted to endoscopy or tomographic optical imaging methods for screening of suspicious lesions and potentially for molecular profiling in vivo.",M1
11818965,"Inherited variants of MYH associated with somatic G:C--&gt;T:A mutations in colorectal tumors.Inherited defects of base excision repair have not been associated with any human genetic disorder, although mutations of the genes mutM and mutY, which function in Escherichia coli base excision repair, lead to increased transversions of G:C to T:A. We have studied family N, which is affected with multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinoma but lacks an inherited mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) that is associated with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. Here we show that 11 tumors from 3 affected siblings contain 18 somatic inactivating mutations of APC and that 15 of these mutations are G:C--&gt;A transversions--a significantly greater proportion than is found in sporadic tumors or in tumors associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. Analysis of the human homolog of mutY, MYH, showed that the siblings were compound heterozygotes for the nonconservative missense variants Tyr165Cys and Gly382Asp. These mutations affect residues that are conserved in mutY of E. coli (Tyr82 and Gly253). Tyrosine 82 is located in the pseudo-helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif and is predicted to function in mismatch specificity. Assays of adenine glycosylase activity of the Tyr82Cys and Gly253Asp mutant proteins with 8-oxoG:A and G:A substrates show that their activity is reduced significantly. Our findings link the inherited variants in MYH to the pattern of somatic APC mutation in family N and implicate defective base excision repair in predisposition to tumors in humans.",M1
11795437,"Chemopreventive agents inhibit aberrant proliferation of the aneuploid phenotype in a colon epithelial cell line established from Apc 1638N [+/-] mouse.Loss of function of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene predisposes for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) syndrome. The Apc gene knockout mice exhibit accelerated intestinal carcinogensis modifiable by diverse pharmacological agents. Present experiments utilized the Apc[+/-] 1638N COL colon epithelial cell line (origin: histologically normal colon) as the model. Retinoid receptor modulator 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO), and nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor sulindac (SUL) represented the chemopreventive test compounds. Population doubling, cell cycle progression, and anchorage-independent growth provided mechanistic end points for chemopreventive efficacy. Treatment of 1638N COL cells with 9-cis-RA, DFMO and SUL produced a dose-dependent cytostatic growth arrest by decreasing the number of population doublings and altering aneuploid G0/G1:S+G2/M ratio. The clonally expanded 1638N-Cl1 cells selected for anchorage-independent growth exhibited decreased anchorage-independent colony formation in response to treatment with the three test compounds. Susceptibility of preneoplastic 1638N COL cells to mechanistically distinct chemopreventive agents validates a unique epithelial cell culture model for FAP syndrome, and facilitates investigations on Apc regulated colon carcinogenesis and cancer prevention.",M1
11746989,"Frequent alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway in colorectal cancer with microsatellite instability.It is generally accepted that both dysfunction of the Wnt signaling pathway, including mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and beta-catenin genes, and genetic instability play important roles in colorectal carcinogenesis. However, alteration of the components in the Wnt signaling pathway in colorectal cancer (CRC) with microsatellite instability (MSI) has not been elucidated. In order to assess the status of the Wnt signaling components in CRC with MSI, mutational analyses of the beta-catenin, APC, Axin 1, and T cell factor 4 (TCF4) genes were performed. Three of 33 samples had mutations in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene and two in the APC gene. Eight mutations in seven samples were detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism and subsequent direct sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the Axin 1 gene. Furthermore, TCF4, which is one of the transcriptional factors in the Wnt signaling pathway and has a mononucleotide repeat sequence (a nine- adenine repeat, (A)9) in its C-terminal region, was mutated in 13 of the 33 samples. Thus, alteration in the Wnt signaling pathway is frequently observed in CRC with MSI, including hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, as well as in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and sporadic CRC without MSI.",M1
11592041,"[Characteristics of APC gene mutations in colorectal tumors]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mutational features of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and their possible arising mechanism in colorectal tumors. METHODS: PCR-based IVSP assay (in vitro synthesized protein test) and sequence analysis were used to determine somatic mutations of whole APC gene in 115 cases with non <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>(non-FAP) colorectal tumors. RESULTS: Seventy-six mutated cases with 101 mutations were confirmed in the study. Analysis of the spectra of APC mutations revealed that frameshift mutations were more common than point ones(56% vs 44%), ninety-one percent of them being insertions/deletions of 1-2 bp, particularly single A (61%) and 51% of point mutations locating at CpG sites. In comparison with sporadic tumors, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) was found to have more frameshift mutations (69% vs 52%, P&lt;0.05), less point mutations at CpG site (31% vs 50%, P&lt;0.05), and a slightly lower frequency of mutations(53% vs 67%, P&gt;0.05). There was no difference in mutational distribution of segment 3 between them (38% vs 46%, P&gt;0.05). It was also found that 15 cases(20%) had double mutations with distance ranging from 7 to 1443 bp, suggesting the coexistance of allelic and non-allelic mutations. CONCLUSION: Based on the mutational spectra of APC gene in colorectal tumors, it can be concluded that most of gene mutations are probably related to DNA mismatch repair deficiency, and the APC mutational patterns of HNPCC and sporadic tumors are quite different. The reason of coexistance of allelic and non-allelic mutations needs to be investigated.",M1
11521200,"Expression of the gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (Krüppel-like factor 4) gene in the human colon cancer cell line RKO is dependent on CDX2.Gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF or KLF4) is a zinc finger-containing, epithelial-specific transcription factor, that functions as a suppressor of cell proliferation. We previously showed that GKLF expression is decreased in intestinal and colonic adenomas, respectively, from multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice and <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) patients. This study shows that GKLF is induced upon activation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. However, among several human colon cancer cell lines surveyed, expression of GKLF is lowest in RKO, a line with wild-type APC and beta-catenin. RKO contains a mutated allele that encodes the putative tumor suppressor homeodomain protein, CDX2. We show that wild-type CDX2 activates the GKLF promoter and that the mutated CDX2 has a dominant negative effect on wild-type function. Our results may help explain the exceedingly low levels of GKLF expression detected in this cell line, which may in turn contribute to the tumor phenotype.",M1
11507063,"Suppression of intestinal polyps in Msh2-deficient and non-Msh2-deficient multiple intestinal neoplasia mice by a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor and by a dual cyclooxygenase-1/2 inhibitor.Epidemiological studies suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. This is believed to be mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. There are two COX isoenzymes, namely the constitutively expressed COX-1 and the inducible COX-2. COX-2 is overexpressed in adenomas and colorectal cancers, and COX-2-specific inhibitors have been shown to inhibit intestinal polyps in Apc(Delta716) mice more effectively than dual COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors such as sulindac. Various Apc knockout mice, including the multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mouse and the Apc(Delta716) mouse, are limited by their lack of large numbers of colonic adenomas and aberrant crypt foci, the putative precursors of large-bowel polyps and cancers. Our DNA mismatch-repair-deficient Min mouse model (Apc+/-Msh2-/-) has genetic features of both <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, and most importantly, rapidly develops numerous small- and large-bowel adenomas, as well as colonic aberrant crypt foci. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of COX inhibitors on intestinal adenomas and colonic aberrant crypt foci in this accelerated polyposis, mismatch-repair-deficient Min mouse model, in addition to a standard Min mouse model. Weanling Apc+/-Msh2-/- and Min mice were fed diets containing no drug, sulindac, or a specific COX-2 inhibitor (MF-tricyclic). Apc+/-Msh2-/- and Min mice were sacrificed after 4 weeks and 5 months on diet, respectively. Apc+/-Msh2-/- mice treated with MF-tricyclic had significantly fewer small-bowel polyps (mean +/- SD, 178 +/- 29) compared with mice on sulindac (278 +/- 80), or control diet (341 +/- 43; P &lt; 0.001). There was no difference in numbers of large-bowel polyps or aberrant crypt foci in mice in the three groups. MF-tricyclic was also effective in reducing both small- and large-bowel polyps in Min mice. Western analysis demonstrated COX-2 expression in both large- and small-bowel polyps from mice of both genotypes. This study demonstrates that a specific COX-2 inhibitor is effective in preventing small-bowel polyps in mismatch-repair-deficient Min mice and both small- and large-bowel polyps in standard Min mice. Therefore, specific COX-2 inhibitors may be useful as chemopreventive and therapeutic agents in humans at risk for colorectal neoplasia.",M1
11420398,"Intestinal tumours induced by the food carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine in multiple intestinal neoplasia mice have truncation mutations as well as loss of the wild-type Apc(+) allele.C57BL/6J-Min/+ (multiple intestinal neoplasia) is a murine model for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP), where the mice are heterozygous for a nonsense Apc(Min) (adenomatous polyposis coli) mutation, and therefore develop numerous spontaneous adenomas in the small intestine and colon. Neonatal exposure of Min/+ mice to the food carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) (eight subcutaneous injections of 25 or 50 mg/kg PhIP to pups or 50 mg/kg PhIP to lactating dams) markedly increased (2--9-fold) the number of intestinal tumours, especially in the small intestine. We examined whether the Apc gene was affected in small intestinal and colonic tumours induced by PhIP. In spontaneous tumours formed in these mice, the main mechanism for tumour induction is loss of the wild-type Apc(+) allele, i.e. loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Also in the PhIP-induced tumours, this is a major mechanism, since large fractions of PhIP-induced tumours had LOH in APC: However, mechanisms other than LOH must also prevail, since a lower frequency of LOH was found in the small intestinal tumours from male mice exposed to PhIP either via breast milk (65%) or by direct injection (68%), compared with the untreated controls (92%). Tumours that had retained the wild-type Apc(+) allele were further analysed for presence of truncated Apc proteins with in vitro synthesized protein (IVSP) assay. Truncated Apc proteins, indicating truncation mutations in exon 15 of the Apc gene, were detected in 20% (8 of 40) of the tumours not showing LOH from the small intestine after PhIP exposure, all in segment 2 (codons 686--1217). Seventeen percent (2 of 12) of the colonic tumours had a truncated Apc protein in segment 3 (codons 1099--1693). Importantly, no truncated proteins were detected in tumours from unexposed mice with apparently retained wild-type Apc(+) allele. These results show that PhIP induces intestinal tumours in the Min/+ mice both by causing LOH and truncation mutations in the wild-type Apc(+) allele.",M1
11293895,"Somatic but not germline mutation of the APC gene in a case of cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma.We report a case of cribriform-morular variant (C-MV) of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in a 27-year-old woman. In addition to conventional cytologic features of typical PTC, the fine-needle aspirate showed numerous epithelial cells with abundant, eosinophilic, very elongated cytoplasm. Microscopically, the tumor was encapsulated and highly cellular and exhibited a mixture of cribriform, follicular, papillary, trabecular, solid, and spindle cell patterns of growth, with morular foci showing peculiar nuclear clearing (biotin-rich nuclei). The cells were cuboidal or tall, with frequent nuclear pseudostratification and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei were usually hyperchromatic, with grooving, pallor, and pseudoinclusions. Angioinvasion and foci of capsular invasion were observed. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells showed reactivity for thyroglobulin, epithelial membrane antigen, low- and high-molecular-weight cytokeratins, vimentin, neuron-specific enolase, CD15, estrogen and progesterone receptors, and bcl-2 protein. Molecular genetic analysis of the APC gene revealed a mutation in exon 15 at codon 1309 in tumoral tissue but not in peripheral lymphocytes. These findings support a relationship between the morphologic pattern of the C-MV of PTC and the APC gene and the existence of this variant as a sporadic counterpart of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>-associated thyroid carcinoma.",M1
11245490,"Chemoprevention of intestinal polyposis in the Apcdelta716 mouse by rofecoxib, a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor.Mutations in the human adenomatous polyposis (APC) gene are causative for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP), a rare condition in which numerous colonic polyps arise during puberty and, if left untreated, lead to colon cancer. The APC gene is a tumor suppressor that has been termed the  gatekeeper gene  for colon cancer. In addition to the 100% mutation rate in FAP patients, the APC gene is mutated in &gt;80% of sporadic colon and intestinal cancers. The Apc gene in mice has been mutated either by chemical carcinogenesis, resulting in the Min mouse Apcdelta850, or by heterologous recombination, resulting in the Apcdelta716 or Apedelta1368 mice (M. Oshima et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 92: 4482-4486, 1995). Although homozygote Apc-/- mice are embryonically lethal, the heterozygotes are viable but develop numerous intestinal polyps with loss of Apc heterozygosity within the polyps (M. Oshima et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 92: 4482-4486, 1995). The proinflammatory, prooncogenic protein cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 has been shown to be markedly induced in the Apcdelta716 polyps at an early stage of polyp development (M. Oshima et al., Cell, 87: 803-809, 1996). We demonstrate here that treatment with the specific COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib results in a dose-dependent reduction in the number and size of intestinal and colonic polyps in the Apcdelta716 mouse. The plasma concentration of rofecoxib that resulted in a 55% inhibition of polyp number and an 80% inhibition of polyps &gt; 1 mm in size is comparable with the human clinical steady-state concentration of 25 mg rofecoxib (Vioxx) taken once daily (A. Porras et al., Clin. Pharm. Ther., 67: 137, 2000). Polyps from both untreated and rofecoxib- or sulindac-treated Apcdelta716 mice expressed COX-1 and -2, whereas normal epithelium from all mice expressed COX-1 but minimal amounts of COX-2. Polyps from either rofecoxib- or sulindac-treated mice had lower rates of DNA replication, expressed less proangiogenic vascular endothelial-derived growth factor and more membrane-bound beta-catenin, but showed unchanged nuclear localization of this transcription factor. This study showing the inhibition of polyposis in the Apcdelta716 mouse suggests that the specific COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (Vioxx) has potential as a chemopreventive agent in human intestinal and colon cancer.",M1
11238055,"Frequent beta-catenin mutations in juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas.Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas (JNAs) are locally aggressive vascular tumors occurring predominantly in adolescent males. The pathogenesis of JNAs is unknown. Recently, JNAs have been reported to occur at increased frequency among patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, suggesting that alterations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)/beta-catenin pathway might also be involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic JNAs. We analyzed somatic beta-catenin and APC gene mutations in 16 sporadic JNAs from nonfamilial adenomatous polyposis patients using immunohistochemistry for beta-catenin, and direct DNA sequencing for exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene and the mutation cluster region of the APC gene. Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was diffusely present in the stromal cells but not in the endothelial cells of all 16 JNAs. Activating beta-catenin gene mutations were present in 75% (12 of 16) of JNAs. Six JNA patients also had recurrent tumors after surgery, and in all cases the beta-catenin gene status of the recurrent JNA was identical to the initial tumor. No mutations in the mutation cluster region of the APC gene were detected in the four JNAs without beta-catenin mutations. The high frequency of beta-catenin mutations in sporadic JNAs and the presence of identical beta-catenin gene mutations in recurrent tumors indicates that activating beta-catenin gene mutations are important in the pathogenesis of JNAs. The immunohistochemical localization of beta-catenin only to the nuclei of stromal cells further suggests that the stromal cells, rather than endothelial cells, are the neoplastic cells of JNAs.",M1
11238048,"Sporadic fundic gland polyps: common gastric polyps arising through activating mutations in the beta-catenin gene.Fundic gland polyps (FGPs) are the most common gastric polyps. FGPs traditionally have been regarded as nondysplastic hamartomatous or hyperplastic lesions, but their pathogenesis remains unclear. We have recently shown that somatic adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene alterations are frequently present in FGPs associated with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP), raising the possibility that mutations of the beta-catenin gene affecting the APC/beta-catenin pathway might be involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic FGPs. We analyzed somatic beta-catenin gene mutations in 57 sporadic FGPs from 40 patients without FAP and in 19 FGPs from 13 FAP patients. Direct DNA sequencing of exon 3 encompassing the glycogen synthase kinase-3beta phosphorylation region for beta-catenin was used with confirmation by HIN:fI restriction endonuclease digestion. The foveolar epithelium and dilated fundic glands of the polyps were separately microdissected and analyzed in 22 of 57 sporadic FGPs. Activating beta-catenin gene mutations were present in 91% (52 of 57) of sporadic FGPs. Both the foveolar epithelium and the dilated fundic gland epithelium comprising the polyps were shown to have the same somatic beta-catenin mutation in 21 of 22 (95%) sporadic FGPs. In contrast, beta-catenin gene mutations were not present in any of the 19 FAP-associated FGPs (P: &lt; 0.000001). The high frequency of beta-catenin mutations in sporadic FGPs indicates that these lesions arise through activating mutations of the beta-catenin gene. Beta-catenin mutations in gastrointestinal tract polyps have previously only been demonstrated in a subset of adenomatous (dysplastic) or neoplastic polyps. Sporadic FGPs are therefore the only lesions of the gastrointestinal tract to demonstrate beta-catenin mutations while lacking dysplastic morphology.",M1
11135435,"A search for germline APC mutations in early onset colorectal cancer or familial colorectal cancer with normal DNA mismatch repair.Twenty percent of colorectal cancers (CRCs) arise in people who have a family history of CRC in at least one other relative. Although a fraction of these CRCs are explained by two well-described autosomal dominant syndromes-5% by hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and 1% by <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP)-the cause of the remaining 14% of familial aggregates of CRC is unknown. Many cases of HNPCC are due to germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, leading to the tumor phenotype of microsatellite instability (MSI), and most cases of FAP are caused by germline APC mutations. To date, non-FAP familial CRC aggregates have not been evaluated for germline APC mutations. In this study, we examined the involvement of germline APC mutations in 79 individuals with CRC who had early-age onset of their cancer (age &lt; 50 years) and/or a family history of CRC. Cases with FAP or HNPCC due to defective mismatch repair were excluded from the study. Using conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis and the protein truncation test as the screening methods, no functionally significant germline mutations were detected for any of the cases. An apparently silent polymorphism resulting in a 1-bp alteration of A --&gt; G (proline --&gt; proline) in exon 4 was observed. Additionally, four intervening sequence (IVS) alterations were detected: IVS2-53t--&gt;c in 3 cases; IVS4-17ins T in 3 cases; IVS5+32t--&gt;c in 16 cases; and IVS5+33g--&gt;a in 1 case. All appeared to be polymorphisms present in similar proportions in an average-risk population. We conclude that germline APC mutations do not account for familial MSS (stable microsatellite) CRC associated with few synchronous polyps.",M1
11112217,"Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma: an APC-gene-associated tumor?Nasopharyngeal angiofibromas are extremely rare, locally invasive tumors of unknown cause exclusively occurring in male adolescents. Recently, 6 cases have been reported in patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> coli (Gardners syndrome). Mutations or allelic loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene have therefore been implied in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. The authors analyzed 11 cases of nasopharyngeal angiofibromas from 9 male patients for mutations in the mutation cluster region and allelic loss of the APC gene. Six were primary tumors; 2 first recurrences; and 1, primary tumor with 2 recurrences. Direct sequence analysis was performed on several overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. Detection of allelic loss was performed by restriction length polymorphism analysis at a polymorphic locus. No mutation was detected in 11 tumors of 9 different patients. None of the 9 informative (heterozygous) cases carried an allelic loss. We conclude that alterations of the APC gene do not play a major role in the development of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. The coincidence of nasopharyngeal angiofibromas and adenomatous polyposis coli in some families implies the possibility that another gene in this region might be responsible for the development of nasopharyngeal angiofibromas.

10993425,"Families at risk for colorectal cancer: risk assessment and genetic testing.As befits a common cancer, a family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) is reported by about 10% of individuals. The discovery of the genetic basis of hereditary nonpolyposis CRC and <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> has opened up the possibility for determining genetic predisposition to CRC in asymptomatic family members of affected cases. This article reviews the information needed for accurate risk assessment for those with a family history of CRC. Screening recommendations and the current status of genetic testing, including review of available tests such as microsatellite instability, immunohistochemistry for hMSH2 and hMLH1, testing for I1307K, and gene testing for germline mutations in hMSH2 and hMLH1 are discussed. At the current time, reliable, informative genetic testing, capable of application to broad segments of the population, is an unrealized goal. But as the methodology for testing improves and as better appreciation of the significance and meaning of a positive or negative test result ensues conditions for increased use of genetic testing could emerge.",M1
10969779,"Analysis of adenomatous polyposis coli promoter hypermethylation in human cancer.Germ-line mutations in the tumor suppressor gene APC are associated with hereditary <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP), and somatic mutations are common in sporadic colorectal tumors. We now report that methylation in the promoter region of this gene constitutes an alternative mechanism for gene inactivation in colon and other tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. The APC promoter is hypermethylated in 18% of primary sporadic colorectal carcinomas (n = 108) and adenoma (n = 48), and neoplasia with APC methylation fails to express the APC transcript. Methylation affects only wild-type APC in 95% of cases and is not observed in tumors from FAP patients who have germ-line APC mutations. As with APC mutation, aberrant APC methylation occurs early in colorectal carcinogenesis. When other tumor types are analyzed (n = 208), methylation of the APC promoter is not restricted to the colon but is present in tumors originating elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract but rarely in other tumors. Our data suggest that hypermethylation of APC provides an important mechanism for impairing APC function and further underscores the importance of the APC pathway in gastrointestinal tumorigenesis.",M1
10969066,"Suppression of intestinal polyposis in Apc(delta 716) knockout mice by an additional mutation in the cytosolic phospholipase A(2) gene.Arachidonic acid is a precursor for biosynthesis of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and lipoxins. Cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) plays a key role in the release of arachidonic acid as the substrate of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) or COX-2. We found that the level of cPLA(2) mRNA was markedly elevated in the polyps and correlated with the polyp size in the small intestine of the Apc(delta)(716) knockout mouse, a model for human <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. To determine the role of cPLA(2) in intestinal tumorigenesis, we then introduced a cPLA(2) gene mutation into Apc(delta)(716) mice. In the compound mutant mice, the size of the small intestinal polyps was reduced significantly, although the numbers remained unchanged. These results provide direct genetic evidence that cPLA(2) plays a key role in the expansion of polyps in the small intestine rather than in the initiation process. In contrast, colonic polyps were not affected in either size or number. Interestingly, group X sPLA(2) was constitutively expressed in the colon at much higher levels than in the small intestine. These results suggest that in the colon, group X sPLA(2) supplies arachidonic acid in both the normal epithelium and the polyps even in the absence of cPLA(2).",M1

Since early reports, there is considerable controversy regarding the modality of genetic transmission and the distinction from other syndromes like <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>(FAP). Recent molecular evidence suggests that Turcot syndrome could be divided into the following two entities based on the distinct genetic backgrounds. (1) True Turcot syndrome(autosomal recessive): Intestinal polyps are less in number(&lt; 100), large in size and apt to transform to the malignant tumor. Brain tumor is mainly diagnosed as glioblastoma or astrocytoma and mismatch repair genes might be involved. (2) FAP-associated type(autosomal dominant): Predisposing to medulloblastoma.",M1
10782927,"A germline mutation at the extreme 3' end of the APC gene results in a severe desmoid phenotype and is associated with overexpression of beta-catenin in the desmoid tumor.Desmoid tumors arise sporadically or as part of the extraintestinal manifestations of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP). In FAP, two distinct clinical presentations of the desmoid phenotype are seen: 1) one or a few desmoid tumors present predominantly in the abdominal wall or the abdomen; 2) a florid proliferation of tumors early in life, mostly near the axial skeleton or extremities. These different phenotypes have been associated with different sites of germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC gene). We present a large, French-Canadian kindred with a florid desmoid tumor phenotype caused by a germline mutation at codon 2643-2644 of the APC gene. The phenotype was characterized by the early onset of multiple tumors, arising near the axial skeleton and in proximal extremities. The penetrance of desmoid tumors was near 100% in this kindred. However, the expression of the disease was variable amongst the different affected relatives. Many gene carriers had cutaneous cysts. Polyposis of the colon was rarely observed in the affected individuals and we did not document upper gastro-intestinal polyps. The mutant APC allele did not express a stable truncated protein in vivo. Molecular analysis of the proband's tumor DNA revealed a somatic inactivating mutation of the wild-type allele. Immunohistochemistry on the tumor also demonstrated elevated levels of beta-catenin. The present study demonstrates that this extreme 3' APC mutation is associated with a severely penetrant desmoid phenotype and attenuated polyposis coli. It also suggests the involvement of the beta-catenin pathway in the development of desmoid tumors in FAP. The natural history of the disease is variable between individuals, and surgical interventions have to be timed appropriately due to the frequent recurrences.",M1
10766173,"Chemopreventive efficacy of combined piroxicam and difluoromethylornithine treatment of Apc mutant Min mouse adenomas, and selective toxicity against Apc mutant embryos.Genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 decreases the number and size of adenomas in mouse models of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. Epidemiological and clinical studies in humans indicate that the entire class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes are promising colon cancer chemopreventive agents. We used the Apc mutant Min mouse model to test combinations of agents that might maximize preventive benefit with minimal toxicity because they act via different mechanisms. Min mice (n = 144) were exposed to low doses of the nonselective COX inhibitor piroxicam and the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), beginning at the time they were weaned and continuing throughout the duration of the experiment. Piroxicam at 12, 25, and 50 ppm in the diet caused dose-dependent decreases in the number of tumors in the middle and distal portions of the small intestine. This decrease in tumor multiplicity was associated with a striking decrease in the size of those tumors that did grow out. In contrast, none of the doses of piroxicam alone decreased tumor multiplicity in the proximal portion of the intestine (duodenum). Exposure to DFMO (0.5 or 1.0% in water) caused a dose-dependent decrease in tumor multiplicity in the middle and distal portions of the small intestine. However, this decreased multiplicity was not associated with a striking decrease in the size of the tumors. Combined treatment of mice with piroxicam plus DFMO was much more effective than either agent alone and resulted in a significant number of mice totally free of any intestinal adenomas (P &lt; 0.001), in contrast to the 100% incidence and high multiplicity in control Min mice. In addition to this profound effectiveness in reducing tumor number, the few residual tumors in mice treated with the combined drugs were markedly smaller in size than tumors that arose from control Min mice. These experiments suggest that selective COX-2 inhibition combined with ODC inhibition is a very promising approach for colon cancer prevention. These COX-2 and ODC inhibitor drugs were not overtly toxic at the doses used when administered to mice after weaning. However, when treatment was begun in utero, the Mendelian expected progeny ratio of 1:1 that we routinely obtained in untreated control litters was no longer observed. Apc(min)/+ progeny of pregnant dams treated with piroxicam and/or DFMO were reduced in number and their ratio to Apc+/+ progeny was decreased to approximately 0.28:1. Thus, these agents are effective against adenomas that have homozygous mutation of the APC gene and also select against fetuses bearing a heterozygous mutation in the APC gene.",M1
10737795,"APC mutations in sporadic colorectal tumors: A mutational  hotspot  and interdependence of the  two hits .Although APC mutations occur at a high frequency in colorectal cancers, few studies have performed a comprehensive analysis by screening the whole gene for mutations and assessing allelic loss. APC seems to act as a tumor-suppressor gene in a  nonclassical  fashion: data from <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) show that the site of the germ-line mutation determines the type of  second hit  in FAP tumors, and simple protein inactivation is selected weakly, if at all. In this study, we screened the entire coding region of APC for mutations and assessed allelic loss in a set of 41 colorectal cancer cell lines. Of 41 cancers, 32 (83%) showed evidence of APC mutation and/or allelic loss. We identified several APC mutations and found a  hotspot  for somatic mutation in sporadic colorectal tumors at codon 1,554. Our results suggest that APC mutations occur in the great majority of colorectal cancers, the exceptions almost all being RER+ tumors, which may substitute for altered APC function by mutations in beta-catenin and/or at other loci. When combined with previously published data, our results show that there is interdependence of the  two hits  at APC in sporadic colorectal tumors as well as in FAP. APC mutations in the  mutation cluster region,  especially those close to codon 1,300, are associated with allelic loss, whereas tumors with mutations outside this region tend to harbor truncating mutations. The causes of this phenomenon are probably selection for retained N-terminal and lost C-terminal APC functions, effects on beta-catenin levels, and APC protein stability.",M1
10717531,"Truncated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor protein can undergo tyrosine phosphorylation.Numerous mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene have been described in colorectal cancer. The vast majority introduce nonsense codons leading to the production of truncated N-terminal APC fragments. Mutations occurring before APC codon 158, have been associated with an attenuated form of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> whereas those occurring at codon 168 or beyond lead to the characteristic form of the disease. These 10 amino acid residues of APC contain a YYAQ motif which appears to constitute a potential SH2 binding domain similar to a sequence present in tyrosine kinase receptors that activate STAT 3 when phosphorylated. We have expressed a recombinant, N-terminal APC fragment in bacterial cells, and shown that it can indeed undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in this domain. We used site-directed mutagenesis to confirm the specificity of the reaction. These observations raise the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation may be another mechanism involved in controlling APC function.",M1
10656683,"The APC-hDLG complex negatively regulates cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to S phase.The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is mutated in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and in many sporadic colorectal tumors. The carboxyl-terminal S/TXV motif of the APC gene product interacts with the PDZ domain of hDLG, the human homolog of the Drosophila lethal (1) discs larige-1 (dlg) tumor suppressor. In the present study, we found that overexpression of hDLG suppresses cell proliferation by blocking cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to S phase. This inhibition of cell cycle progression was abolished when the PDZ, SH3 or guanylate kinase-like domain of hDLG was mutated. Moreover, overexpression of these mutant hDLGs partially interfered with the cell cycle blocking activity of APC. Consistent with this result, mutant APC lacking the S/TXV motif exhibited weaker cell cycle blocking activity than the intact APC. These results suggest that APC-hDLG complex formation plays an important role in transducing the APC cell cycle blocking signal.",M1
10597266,"Predominance of beta-catenin mutations and beta-catenin dysregulation in sporadic aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor).Aggressive fibromatosis (also called desmoid tumor) occurs as a sporadic lesion or as part of <e>Familial Adenomatous Polyposis</e>, which is caused by germ line mutations in the Adenomatous polyposis Coli (APC) gene. APC is involved in the regulation of the cellular level of beta-catenin, which is a mediator in Wnt signaling. Mutational analysis of the beta-catenin and APC genes was performed in 42 sporadic aggressive fibromatoses. Nine tumors had mutations in APC, and 22 had a point mutation in beta-catenin at either codon 45 or codon 41 (producing a stabilized beta-catenin protein product). Immunohistochemistry showed an elevated beta-catenin protein level in all tumors, regardless of mutational status. Beta-catenin localized to the nucleus, and was not tyrosine phosphorylated in the six tumors in which this was tested. The demonstration of mutations in two mediators in the Wnt-APC-beta-catenin pathway implicates beta-catenin stabilization as the key factor in the pathogenesis of aggressive fibromatosis. This is the first demonstration of somatic beta-catenin mutations in a locally invasive, but non metastatic lesion composed of spindle cells, illustrating the importance of beta-catenin stabilization in a variety of cell types and neoplastic processes. Moreover, this tumor has one of the highest reported frequencies of beta-catenin mutations of any tumor type.",M1
10545404,"Introduction of full-length APC modulates cyclooxygenase-2 expression in HT-29 human colorectal carcinoma cells at the translational level.Mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is associated with the earliest stages of colorectal tumorigenesis and appears to be responsible for the hereditary condition <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP). Evidence indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is induced and at elevated levels in human colorectal cancers and in the polyps of mouse FAP models. We have used HT-29 cells, a human colorectal carcinoma cell line with a mutant carboxy-truncated APC gene, in which intact APC gene has been introduced under the control of an inducible promoter. These HT-29-APC cells provide a suitable model system to examine how COX-2 expression becomes dysregulated after loss of APC function. Induction of full-length APC causes the HT-29-APC cells to undergo apoptosis. However, differentiation, as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity, is not induced upon expression of full-length APC. Full-length APC protein has been shown to bind the intracellular protein beta-catenin and, as a result, the Lef/Tcf transcription factors are down-regulated. Analysis of APC immunoprecipitates demonstrate a time-dependent increase of beta-catenin interacting with full-length APC. Thus, the Lef/Tcf signaling pathway is intact at this point in these cells. Furthermore, upon expression of full-length APC, COX-2 protein expression is down-regulated while COX-2 mRNA levels remain the same. These data indicate that APC plays a role, either directly or indirectly, in the translational regulation of COX-2. Treatment of the HT-29-APC cells with sodium butyrate, an inducer of apoptosis, does not alter COX-2 protein expression. Thus, COX-2 down-regulation appears to be APC specific and not just due to apoptotic induction. APC appears to uniquely regulate COX-2 expression. The mechanism by which COX-2 protein expression is down-regulated in the HT-29-APC cells is under investigation.",M1
10469614,"APC-dependent changes in expression of genes influencing polyamine metabolism, and consequences for gastrointestinal carcinogenesis, in the Min mouse.The colorectal mucosa of pre-symptomatic individuals with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) contains elevated levels of the proliferation-associated polyamines. The Min mouse, like humans with FAP, expresses an abnormal genotype for the APC tumor suppressor gene. In order to determine how APC mutation influences intestinal tissue polyamine content, we measured steady-state RNA levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the first enzyme in polyamine synthesis, antizyme (AZ), a protein which negatively regulates ODC, and the spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT), the first enzyme in polyamine catabolism. RNA content was increased 6- to 8-fold in both the small intestine and colon for ODC, decreased significantly in the small intestine but not the colon for AZ and was not statistically different in either intestinal tissue for SSAT in Min mice compared with normal littermates. Consistent with the changes in ODC and AZ gene expression, small intestinal, but not colonic, polyamine content was elevated in Min mice compared with normal littermates. Treatment of Min mice with the specific ODC inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) suppressed small intestinal, but not colonic, polyamine content and tumor number. These data indicate that small intestinal tissue polyamine content is elevated in Min mice by a mechanism involving APC-dependent changes in ODC and AZ RNA. Further, ODC enzyme activity, which is influenced by both ODC and AZ RNA levels and inhibited by DFMO, is consequential for small intestinal tumorigenesis in this model. In the FAP population, DFMO may be of value in the chemoprevention of small intestinal adenocarcinoma that remains a risk following colectomy.",M1
10223208,"Differential expression of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-2 and formation of activated beta-catenin-LEF-1 transcription complex in mouse colonic epithelial cells contrasting in Apc.Mutations in Apc underlie the intestinal lesions in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and are found in &gt;85% of sporadic colon cancers. They are frequently associated with overexpression of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-2 (PGHS-2) in colonic adenomas. It has been suggested that Apc mutations are linked mechanistically to increased PGHS-2 expression by elevated nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin-Tcf-LEF transcription complex. In the present study, we show that PGHS-2 is differentially expressed in mouse colonic epithelial cells with distinct Apc status. Cells with a mutated Apc expressed markedly higher levels of PGHS-2 mRNA and protein and produced significantly more prostaglandin E2 than cells with normal Apc. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that DNA-beta-catenin-LEF-1 complex formation is differentially induced in these two cell lines in an Apc-dependent manner. Our data indicate that the differential induction of beta-catenin-LEF-1 complex correlates closely with differential expression of PGHS-2. These findings support the hypothesis that the differential expression of PGHS-2 is mediated through the proposed beta-catenin/Tcf-LEF signaling pathway.",M1

In the analyzed exon 15 of the APC gene determined by the primers 15Efor-15Grev for HDA and 15ET7-15J3 for PTT more than 70% of mutations should be deletions [3, 12], which are detectable by HDA. In our collection of 5 FAP families mutations in the APC gene were found in families 10, 27 and 41 using HDA. By PTT test the formation of truncated APC protein in FAP families 2, 10, 16 and 27 were revealed. The necessity of combination of at least HDA and PTT techniques for exact detection of APC mutations in analyzed APC region is discussed.",M1

The molecular pathogenesis of HB is poorly understood. Although most cases are sporadic, the incidence is highly elevated in patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> coli. These patients carry germline mutations of the APC tumor suppressor gene. APC controls the degradation of the oncogene product beta-catenin after its NH2-terminal phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues. APC, as well as beta-catenin, has been found to be a central effector of the growth promoting wingless signaling pathway in development. To find out if this pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic HBs, we examined 52 biopsies and three cell lines from sporadic HBs for mutations in the APC and beta-catenin genes. Using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis, deletion screening by PCR, and direct sequencing, we found a high frequency of beta-catenin mutations in sporadic HBs (48%). The mutations affected exon 3 encoding the degradation targeting box of beta-catenin leading to accumulation of intracytoplasmic and nuclear beta-catenin protein. The high frequency of activating mutations in the beta-catenin gene indicates an important role in the pathogenesis of HB.",M1

9724771,"The APC variants I1307K and E1317Q are associated with colorectal tumors, but not always with a family history.Classical <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) is a high-penetrance autosomal dominant disease that predisposes to hundreds or thousands of colorectal adenomas and carcinoma and that results from truncating mutations in the APC gene. A variant of FAP is attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli, which results from germ-line mutations in the 5' and 3' regions of the APC gene. Attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli patients have  multiple  colorectal adenomas (typically fewer than 100) without the florid phenotype of classical FAP. Another group of patients with multiple adenomas has no mutations in the APC gene, and their phenotype probably results from variation at a locus, or loci, elsewhere in the genome. Recently, however, a missense variant of APC (I1307K) was described that confers an increased risk of colorectal tumors, including multiple adenomas, in Ashkenazim. We have studied a set of 164 patients with multiple colorectal adenomas and/or carcinoma and analyzed codons 1263-1377 (exon 15G) of the APC gene for germ-line variants. Three patients with the I1307K allele were detected, each of Ashkenazi descent. Four patients had a germ-line E1317Q missense variant of APC that was not present in controls; one of these individuals had an unusually large number of metaplastic polyps of the colorectum. There is increasing evidence that there exist germ-line variants of the APC gene that predispose to the development of multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinoma, but without the florid phenotype of classical FAP, and possibly with importance for colorectal cancer risk in the general population.",M1

An APC gene sequence alteration, the I1307K allele, occurs in 6% of the Ashkenazi Jewish population and is reported to double the risk for colorectal cancer. We screened a population of 190 Ashkenazi women who were diagnosed with epithelial ovarian carcinoma for the I1307K variant and measured the effect of this allele on the risk for cancer development in their first-degree relatives. We identified the I1307K allele in 7.9% (15 of 190) of our ovarian cancer cases. The average age of ovarian cancer diagnosis in carriers of the I1307K allele (57.5 years) was not statistically different than the age for noncarriers (56.4 years; P = 0.70). Among the 1087 first-degree relatives, there were 23 cases of colorectal cancer; 3 of 100 relatives of probands with the I1307K allele (3.0%) had a history of colorectal cancer versus 20 of 987 relatives of probands without the I1307K allele (2.1%; relative risk, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-4.88; P = 0.462). Relatives of the I1307K carriers had a risk of 38.0% for developing any cancer to age 80, similar to the risk for relatives of noncarriers of the I1307K allele (42.1%; P = 0.86). The average age of diagnosis of cancer of any type was not different between relatives of carriers (59.0 years) and noncarriers (60.4 years).

9664575,"Rapid RT-PCR-based protein truncation test in the screening for 5' located mutations of the APC gene.Although in vitro protein synthesis is a rapid method to screen for translational stops in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, truncating mutations at the 5' most end are at risk of being overseen due to their small size. The authors describe a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based protein truncation test specifically designed for detecting truncated polypeptide chains of less than 10 kDa. Using this detection system, three novel germline mutations in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) patients were identified, i.e. a Gly101 Ter non-sense mutation in exon 3, an exon 4 splice acceptor mutation and a 555delC deletion in exon 5. Morever, a patient manifesting congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium (CHPRE) was detected with an Arg232Ter mutation in exon 6. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the fourth exception to the rule that FAP patients manifesting CHRPE harbour genetic alternations downstream from APC exon 9. Hence, an alternative hotspot for non-sense mutations associated with CHRPE appears to encompass the codons 215, 216 and 232. Patients reported in this study, exhibited relatively mild clinical symptoms with respect to the age of onset of malignancy (&gt; 50 years of age) and the number of polyps (70-100 adenomas).

We analysed mutations in exon 15 of the rat Apc gene using in vitro synthesized protein assay in 66 ACF and in 28 colon tumours induced by azoxymethane. No Apc mutations were found in ACF, whereas five mutations were found in the tumours.

Acarbose, an alpha-glycosidase inhibitor, may also be chemopreventive. In order to examine the effects of these drugs we employed APC gene knockout mice randomized into 3 groups, one for treatment with piroxicam (0.05% concentration in drinking water), one for acarbose (0.04% concentration in food) and another for the control. After 14 weeks of treatment, mice were killed for quantitation of gastric and intestinal adenomas. Tumor multiplicity in the whole gastrointestinal tract decreased from 33.89 +/- 13.07 tumors/mouse in the control group to 17.05 +/- 7 tumors/mouse in the piroxicam-treated group (P &lt; 0.001).

Almost all of the APC mutations are nonsense or frameshift mutations, which truncate the APC protein and are thought to inactivate normal APC function. We show a novel method for detecting nonsense and frameshift APC gene mutations by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified APC fragments are cloned directly into yeast expression vectors in vivo, and the yeast expresses a hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged APC peptide. When an APC fragment contains a nonsense or frameshift mutation, HA-tagged truncating APC peptide can be detected by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody. We identified both germ-line and somatic APC mutations in patients with FAP and non-FAP colorectal tumors, respectively. This method, called the yeast-based protein truncation test (YPTT), is simple and fairly cheap, and it can be applied to any genes that are inactivated by protein truncating mutations.",M1
9512122,"Screening for APC mutations based on detection of truncated APC proteins.Mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is frequently found in colorectal tumors from both <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) and non-FAP patients. Analysis of APC mutation is time-consuming and costly due to the large size of the APC gene. As the majority of APC mutations result in the truncation of gene products, the detection of truncated APC proteins may be used as a screening method for APC mutations. The aim of this study is to establish a practical method of detecting truncated APC proteins for the screening of APC mutations. APC proteins in human colorectal cancer cell lines were analyzed by western blotting. Truncated APC proteins were expressed in all of the colorectal cancer cell lines studied. Two species of truncated APC proteins were expressed in two cell lines. Western blotting is a rapid, reliable screening method for APC mutations and provides information on both alleles.",M1
9395221,"Intestinal and extra-intestinal tumor multiplicities in the Apc1638N mouse model after exposure to X-rays.Seven-week-old Apc1638N mice were exposed to a single dose of 5 Gy total-body X-irradiation resulting in a 8-fold increase in the number of intestinal tumors and a reduction of the lifespan to an average of 6 months. The distribution of tumors along the intestinal tract as well as the adenoma/carcinoma ratio, were similar between non-irradiated and irradiated animals. Semi-quantitative PCR analysis of intestinal-tumor DNA revealed that 10 out of 14 tumors had lost the wild-type Apc allele. However, in contrast to spontaneous Apc1638N intestinal tumors in which the LOH event at the Apc locus involves the entire chromosome 18 (1), in 6 out of 10 tumors derived from X-irradiated animals the Apc loss is associated with only a partial intrachromosomal deletion. The remaining tumors have lost all chromosome 18 markers tested. In addition to the intestinal tumors, female Apc1638N mice are susceptible to the development of mammary tumors. Upon X-irradiation, Apc1638N mice show a striking 15-fold increase in mammary tumors. Moreover, Apc1638N mice spontaneously develop other extra-intestinal neoplasia, such as desmoid-like lesions similar to those associated with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP), the human syndrome caused by germline mutations in the APC gene. Spontaneous desmoid growth is sex-dependent, as male Apc1638N mice develop 3-fold more desmoids than female mice. Interestingly, X-irradiation seemed to increase the number of desmoids per animal nearly twofold only in female Apc1638N mice. Five out of 9 desmoids found in Apc1638N mice exposed to X-ray displayed loss of the wild-type Apc allele.",M1
9363991,"Suppression of intestinal polyp development by low-fat and high-fiber diet in Apc(delta716) knockout mice.Most epidemiological and animal studies show a positive correlation of the dietary intake of fat with the incidence of colon cancer, whereas an inverse correlation of the dietary intake of fiber. In rats fed a diet low in fat and high in wheat bran fiber and calcium, a significant decrease was reported in the number of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci compared with those fed a high-fat, low-fiber and low-calcium diet. Mutations in the human APC gene play a key role, not only in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, but also in many sporadic cancers of the entire digestive tract. We previously constructed a mouse strain Apc(delta716), carrying a truncation mutation at codon 716 of the Apc gene, the homolog of human APC (10). The heterozygous mice developed numerous intestinal polyps, and all microadenomas dissected from the earliest polyps had already lost the wild-type allele, indicating the loss of heterozygosity. Using these Apc(delta716) knockout mice, we have investigated the effect of a low-fat and high-fiber diet (LRD for 'low-risk' diet) on intestinal polyposis, and compared it with that of a high-fat and low-fiber diet (HRD for 'high-risk' diet). The mice were fed either diet for 7 weeks, and the number and size of intestinal polyps were scored. The LRD-fed mice had fewer polyps than the HRD-fed mice, by 36% in the small intestine and by 64% in the colon. As for the polyp size distribution, there was no significant difference between the HRD- and LRD-fed mice. These results indicate that LRD can suppress intestinal polyposis compared with HRD which does not, and suggest that its suppression is at the initiation of polyp formation. This is likely to be due to a decreased frequency of loss of heterozygosity, rather than a retarded growth of the polyp adenomas.",M1
9250146,"Increased beta-catenin protein and somatic APC mutations in sporadic aggressive fibromatoses (desmoid tumors).Sporadic aggressive fibromatosis (also called desmoid tumor) is a monoclonal proliferation of spindle (fibrocyte-like) cells that is locally invasive but does not metastasize. A similarity to abdominal fibromatoses (desmoids) in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and a cytogenetic study showing partial deletion of 5q in a subset of aggressive fibromatoses suggests that the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene plays a role in its pathogenesis. APC helps regulate the cellular level of beta-catenin, which is a downstream mediator in Wnt (Wingless) signaling. beta-Catenin has a nuclear function (binds transcription factors) and a cell membrane function (is a component of epithelial cell adherens junctions). Six cases of aggressive fibromatosis of the extremities from patients without familial adenomatous polyposis, or a family history of colon cancer, were studied. Immunohistochemistry, using carboxy and amino terminus antibodies to APC, and DNA sequencing showed that three of the six contained an APC-truncating mutation, whereas normal tissues did not contain a mutation. Western blot and Northern dot blot showed that all six tumors had a higher level of beta-catenin protein than surrounding normal tissues, despite containing similar levels of beta-catenin mRNA. Immunohistochemistry localized beta-catenin throughout the cell in tumor tissues, although it localized more to the periphery in cells from normal tissues. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the tumors expressed N-cadherin but not E-cadherin (a pattern of expression of proteins making up adherens junctions similar to fibrocytes), suggesting that the specific adherens junctions present in epithelial cells are not necessary for beta-catenin function. Increased beta-catenin may cause the growth advantage of cells in this tumor through a nuclear mechanism. The increased protein level, relative to the RNA level, suggests that beta-catenin is degraded at a lower rate compared with normal tissues. In some cases, this is caused by a somatic mutation resulting in a truncated APC protein.",M1
9163695,"2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine increases the numbers of tumors, cystic crypts and aberrant crypt foci in multiple intestinal neoplasia mice.The multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice have a mutation in the murine adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) gene rendering them highly susceptible to spontaneous intestinal adenoma formation, similar to the <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) syndrome in humans. We studied whether the most abundant mutagenic heterocyclic amine isolated from cooked food, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), could influence early intestinal neoplasia in C57BL/6J-Min/+ and C57BL/6J- +/+ (wild-type) mice of both sexes. PhIP was given in 4 weekly i.p. injections of 50 mg/kg. Ten weeks after the start of the experiment, PhIP had significantly increased the numbers of small tumors and cystic crypts in the proximal section of the small intestine in male Min/+ mice, and the numbers of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the large intestines of both males and females. The effects of PhIP were more pronounced in male than in female Min/+ mice. In +/+ mice, no tumors or cystic crypts in the small intestine, and no tumors and only a very few ACF in the large intestine, were induced by PhIP. These results show that a substance frequently present in the human diet is able to enhance the neoplastic process induced by a genetic lesion, which is also commonly found both in inherited and sporadic colon carcinomas in humans.",M1
9122215,"Detection of heterozygous truncating mutations in the BRCA1 and APC genes by using a rapid screening assay in yeast.The detection of inactivating mutations in tumor suppressor genes is critical to their characterization, as well as to the development of diagnostic testing. Most approaches for mutational screening of germ-line specimens are complicated by the fact that mutations are heterozygous and that missense mutations are difficult to interpret in the absence of information about protein function. We describe a novel method using Saccharomyces cerevisiae for detecting protein-truncating mutations in any gene of interest. The PCR-amplified coding sequence is inserted by homologous recombination into a yeast URA3 fusion protein, and transformants are assayed for growth in the absence of uracil. The high efficiency of homologous recombination in yeast ensures that both alleles are represented among transformants and achieves separation of alleles, which facilitates subsequent nucleotide sequencing of the mutated transcript. The specificity of translational initiation of the URA3 gene leads to minimal enzymatic activity in transformants harboring an inserted stop codon, and hence to reliable distinction between specimens with wild-type alleles and those with a heterozygous truncating mutation. This yeast-based stop codon assay accurately detects heterozygous truncating mutations in the BRCA1 gene in patients with early onset of breast cancer and in the APC gene in patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. This approach offers a rapid and reliable method for genetic diagnosis in individuals at high risk for germ-line mutations in cancer susceptibility genes.",M1
9096643,"Hypermethylation of the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene promoter region in human colorectal carcinoma.Germline mutations of the putative tumor suppressor gene APC are associated in high frequency with the <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, predisposing the patients to colorectal neoplasia. Similarly, sequence analyses have revealed that in more than half of patients with sporadic colorectal carcinoma or adenoma, the APC gene was mutated. By employing genomic sequencing, i.e., base-specific analysis of methylated cytosines, we show here that the promoter region of the APC gene is heavily methylated at CpG sites in patients with colorectal carcinoma in comparison with normal colonic mucosa and premalignant adenomas. Our results suggest that cytosine methylation of the regulatory sequences of the APC gene could be involved in the progression of human colorectal cancer.",M1
9296069,"Colon cancer. Molecular biology of the APC protein.The discovery of a tumor suppressor gene opens a new pathway to discovery of the fundamental mechanisms that underlie tumor initiation and progression. An inherited tumor suppressor gene is of special interest in that it defines a step in the tumorigenesis pathway that can be rate limiting in development of that tumor type. In the case of colon cancer, we were fortunate in identifying an inherited tumor suppressor gene, the APC gene, that plays a major etiologic role in both the inherited disease, <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP), and in sporadic colon polyps. Characterization of the molecular biology of that gene, and the underlying mechanisms that result in the development of colon tumors, could provide new approaches to both colon cancer diagnostics, therapeutics and chemopreventives. We have embarked, therefore, on a series of exploratory studies designed to provides clues to possible functional roles for the APC protein. We have found through immunocytochemistry that APC protein is distributed throughout the cell, in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, within the nucleus much of the APC protein seems associated with the nucleoli. The cytoplasmic label is distributed in a punctate pattern, with concentrations at the leading edge of migrating cells at the ends of microtubules. Furthermore, following an extraction of the cells that leaves behind primarily cytoskeletal and nuclear scaffold structures, we see strong APC staining of these structures. The yeast two-hybrid system has offered a number of potentially interacting partners for APC, including a new binding site for alpha-tubulin. These results, and others recent discoveries concerning APC, suggest a rather global role for APC protein, modulating cellular activity and signal transduction pathway from the cell periphery to the nucleus.",M1
9182290,"LOH at the APC/MCC gene (5Q21) in gastric cancer and preneoplastic lesions. Prognostic implications.The APC/MCC gene (<e>Familial Adenomatous Polyposis</e>) at 5q21 plays a role in colon cancer carcinogenesis. LOH at this locus has also been described in gastric cancer and preneoplastic lesions. The APC locus has been recently related to a cell surface adhesion molecule and its alteration may favour metastatic dissemination. LOH at 5q21 has been associated with poor prognosis in other tumors such as lung cancer. Thirty-six gastric cancers were evaluated for LOH at 5q21 with 2 polymorphic markers from microdissected paraffin-embedded material. All tumors were classified by stage, histologic type, degree of differentiation and survival rates. In 4 cases, intestinal metaplasia cells in the adjacent mucosae were also microdissected. Six cases of moderate-severe gastric dysplasia were also added to the study. LOH was determined in 84% of the informative cases of GC, affecting both early and advanced stages of disease. Genomic instability was assessed in 5 cases, 3 of them associated with LOH. The only case of gastric cancer that did not show LOH or instability at 5q21 was a stage II, poorly differentiated intestinal carcinoma without evidence of recurrence after a 36 month follow-up period (the mean survival rate in our series was 28.3% at 36 months). We also found LOH in 2/6 dysplastic lesions and 1/4 intestinal metaplasias. Our data show that LOH at 5q21 is frequent in gastric cancer and is also present in intestinal metaplasia and dysplastic lesions. LOH at this locus is not a prognostic factor in GC in our study, due to the high incidence of LOH that we found.",M1
8968744,"Familial infiltrative fibromatosis (desmoid tumours) (MIM135290) caused by a recurrent 3' APC gene mutation.Desmoid tumours are generally very rare but occur about 100 times more frequently in the colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (MIM 175100), being represented in about 10% of patients. In addition to desmoid disease occurring in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) there exist familial infiltrative fibromatosis (MIM 135290) kindreds where there is no evidence of FAP. Previously we have described a kindred with familial infiltrative fibromatosis (FIF) in which desmoid tumours were associated with nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. FAP is caused by mutations in the APC gene and various genotype-phenotype relationships have been defined including reports that colorectal polyposis is less severe with mutations 5' to codon 157 and that the risk of desmoid tumours is high in FAP patients with APC gene mutations between codons 1444 and 1598. There is relatively little information on the phenotype of APC gene mutations 3' to codon 1598; however, one large family has been reported with a mutation at codon 1987 which presents with a highly variable phenotype which includes desmoid disease. We screened our original FIF kindred and three further families with a similar phenotype for mutations in the APC gene. A 4 bp frameshift deletion in codon 1962 was identified in the original FIF kindred and two further apparently unrelated families. Haplotype analysis suggests a common origin for the APC mutation in all three families. Affected individuals had no evidence of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. Colorectal polyposis was variable, and most affected patients had either none or a few late onset polyps. These findings demonstrate (i) that FAP and FIF are allelic, and (ii) that APC gene mutations which truncate the APC protein distal to the beta-catenin binding domain are associated with desmoid tumours, absent CHRPE and variable but attenuated polyposis expression.",M1
8940264,"Hereditary desmoid disease due to a frameshift mutation at codon 1924 of the APC gene.Desmoid tumors are slowly growing fibrous tumors highly resistant to therapy and often fatal. Here, we report hereditary desmoid disease (HDD), a novel autosomal dominant trait with 100% penetrance affecting a three-generation kindred. Desmoid tumors are usually a complication of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, a predisposition to the early development of premalignant adenomatous polyps in the colorectum due to chain-terminating mutations of the APC gene. In general, one or more members in approximately 10% of the FAP families manifest desmoid tumors. Affected individuals from the HDD kindred are characterized by multifocal fibromatosis of the paraspinal muscles, breast, occiput, arms, lower ribs, abdominal wall, and mesentery. Osteomas, epidermal cysts, and other congenital features were also observed. We show that HDD segregates with an unusual germ-line chain-terminating mutation at the 3' end of the APC gene (codon 1924) with somatic loss of the wild-type allele leading to tumor development.",M1

8831610,"Elevated cyclooxygenase-2 levels in Min mouse adenomas.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Mutations in the APC gene result in an increased propensity to develop intestinal neoplasia; however, a complete understanding of the mechanisms resulting in tumor formation has remained elusive. Min mice possess a mutation in the APC gene and display a neoplastic phenotype similar to that observed in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> coli in humans. Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors decrease tumor multiplicity in the Min mouse intestine. The present study was designed to determine if there was an increase in COX-2 in adenomas harvested from Min mouse intestine. METHODS: COX-2 messenger RNA levels were determined by Northern blots and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions of B6Min x 129 mouse-derived tumors. Protein levels and localization were determined by Western blots and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The Northern blots revealed an approximately threefold increase in the level of COX-2 messenger RNA in Min mouse adenoma compared with normal mucosa. COX-2 protein levels in adenomatous tissues were also approximately threefold higher compared with normal mucosa from the same mouse. Immunohistochemical staining with a monospecific COX-2 antibody confirmed that increases in COX-2 immunoreactivity were restricted to dysplastic and neoplastic foci within intestinal mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that COX-2 levels may be increased at an early stage in colorectal neoplasia during polyp formation and before invasion.",M1
8702414,"Upregulation of the APC gene product during neuronal differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells.The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, the mutation of which is responsible for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and sporadic colorectal tumors, is highly expressed in the central nervous system. To elucidate the contribution of the APC protein to neuronal differentiation, changes in APC expression were examined during nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. The expression of APC gradually increased throughout the time course, in particular it increased markedly after 7 days of exposure to NGF. However, forced expression of APC did not induce neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. These results suggest that the APC protein itself does not have the potential to induce neuronal differentiation, but rather is upregulated secondary to the differentiation of PC12 cells.",M1
8764128,"Somatic mutations of the APC gene in sporadic hepatoblastomas.Hepatoblastoma is a rare hepatic malignancy that occurs in children with an average age of 2 or 3 years and is known to be one of the extracolonic manifestations of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. Only a single hepatoblastoma with a germ-line mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene has been reported thus far. To elucidate the possible roles of APC gene alterations in sporadic hepatoblastomas, we examined loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the APC and MCC loci and performed a sequencing analysis of a part of the APC gene, including the mutation cluster region, in 13 hepatoblastomas of non-familial adenomatous polyposis patients. LOH at the APC and/or MCC loci was observed in four of seven (57%) informative cases. Of the 13 cases, somatic mutations were detected in 8 (61.5%), with 9 (69%) cases showing genetic alterations in the APC gene as LOH or somatic mutations. Two cases demonstrated double mutations. Furthermore, the nature of the somatic mutations observed in the present study was unusual because 9 of the 10 mutations were missense, with only 1 case featuring a frame-shift mutation due to an insertion. Previous reports have described almost all (&gt;90%) mutations of the APC gene in colorectal tumors to result in a truncated APC protein due to either frame-shift or nonsense mutations. These findings suggest that a mutation of the APC gene may play an important role in the genesis of sporadic hepatoblastomas, and the mechanisms of APC gene alteration may be different from those reported previously for colorectal tumors.",M1

The objective was to explore the decision-making process surrounding risk-reducing surgery in FAP using qualitative methodology. METHODS: In-depth, semi-structured interviews with 14 FAP patients and 11 healthcare providers with experience caring for FAP patients were conducted. Using grounded theory, line-by-line content analysis identified categories from which themes describing patients' experiences emerged; analysis continued until data saturation. RESULTS: Median age at surgery was 23 (7-37) years; at interview 41 (19-74) years. Two patients underwent surgery secondary to cancer, the remainder for risk-reduction. Content experts included colorectal surgeons (3), geneticists (2), gastroenterologists (3), nurses (3).Three themes emerged: Information: Family was the primary information source, and patients' level of information varied. The importance of up-front information was emphasized. Influences on decision-making: Influential factors included family experiences, youth, emotional state, support, and decision-making role. Although patients often sought opinions, most (12/14) wanted an active/shared role in decision-making. Life after surgery: Patients described surgery as the  easy part,  emphasizing the need for long-term relationships with care providers. CONCLUSIONS: Decisions surrounding risk-reducing surgery in FAP are unique. A decision support tool may facilitate decision-making, better preparing patients for life after surgery.",M2

The present study tested whether a novel, enteric-coated formulation of EPA, as the free fatty acid (EPA-FFA), has chemopreventative efficacy in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Patients undergoing endoscopic surveillance of their retained rectum postcolectomy were randomised to EPA-FFA (SLA Pharma) 2 g daily or placebo for 6 months. The number and size of polyps in an area of mucosa defined by a tattoo were determined before and after intervention. Global rectal polyp burden was scored (-1, 0, +1) by examination of video endoscopy records. Mucosal fatty acid content was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: 55 patients with FAP were evaluated by an intention-to-treat analysis (EPA-FFA 28, placebo 27). Treatment with EPA-FFA for 6 months was associated with a mean 22.4% (95% CI 5.1% to 39.6%) reduction in polyp number (p=0.012) and a 29.8% (3.6% to 56.1%) decrease in the sum of polyp diameters (p=0.027). Global polyp burden worsened over 6 months in the placebo group (-0.34) unlike the EPA-FFA group (+0.09, difference 0.42 (0.10-0.75), p=0.011). EPA-FFA treatment led to a mean 2.6-fold increase in mucosal EPA levels (p=0.018 compared with placebo). EPA-FFA was well tolerated with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: EPA-FFA has chemopreventative efficacy in FAP, to a degree similar to that previously observed with selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors. EPA holds promise as a colorectal cancer chemoprevention agent with a favourable safety profile.",M2

The immunological mechanisms involved in the genesis of pouchitis are unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the inflammatory activity in normal ileal pouch mucosa by determining signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT-1) activation and cytokine expression in patients operated for UC and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Eighteen asymptomatic patients, who underwent total rectocolectomy and J pouch, were evaluated: nine with UC and nine with FAP. The activation of STAT-1 and cytokine expression were determined by immunoblot of total protein extracts from pouch mucosal biopsies. The absence of pouchitis was assessed by clinical, histological and endoscopic parameters, according to the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index. The patients were not receiving any medication. Analysis of variance (anova) and Tukey-Kramer's test were applied. The local ethical committee approved the study and informed consent was signed by all participants. STAT-1 activation was increased in UC when compared to FAP and controls (P &lt; 0.05). Higher levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma expression were observed in UC patients when compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.05), but were similar to FAP. In contrast, cytokine signalling (SOCS-3) and interleukin (IL)-10 expression were similar in all groups (P &gt; 0.05). These findings could explain the higher susceptibility to this inflammatory complication in UC when compared to FAP. A tendency towards increased levels of IFN-gamma and STAT-1 in patients with UC, even without clinical and endoscopic evidence of pouchitis, was observed; studying inflammatory activity in asymptomatic ileal pouches may help understanding of the pathogenesis of pouchitis.",M2
20345333,"Pharmacotherapy for inherited colorectal cancer.IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: An important recent consideration in the medical management of colorectal cancer risk has been the notion of primary prevention or 'chemoprevention' of adenomas. A number of promising agents, and even combinations of agents, have shown promise in clinical trials. This review is written in the interest of capturing the current state of chemoprevention in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP). This will take a decidedly clinical perspective. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review addresses mainly randomized clinical chemoprevention trials. A search using PubMed from 1980 to present was conducted. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader should gain an appreciation of the role that chemoprevention clinical trials in FAP has had in establishing a basis for clinically oriented use of selected drugs, mainly sulindac and celecoxib, as adjuncts to surgical and endoscopic treatment. In addition, the reader will see how FAP trials can provide a foundation for similar trials in nonfamilial adenomas. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: As a proving ground for new, potential chemopreventive agents, trials in FAP involved short-term (3- to 12-month) administration of drug. Endpoints generally involved measures of adenoma regression in the rectal segment retained post-colectomy.",M2
20234350,"The safety and efficacy of celecoxib in children with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.OBJECTIVES: Celecoxib is approved as an adjunctive chemopreventive agent in adults with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Its safety and efficacy for colorectal polyps in children is unknown. We evaluated the short-term (3 months) safety and preliminary efficacy of celecoxib in children with FAP. METHODS: This was a phase I, dose-escalation trial, with three successive cohorts of six children. Children of ages 10-14 years with APC gene mutations and/or adenomas with a family history of FAP were studied at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and the Cleveland Clinic. Colonoscopy was performed at baseline and month 3. Random assignment was in a 2:1 generic:placebo ratio, escalating from cohort 1 (4 mg/kg/day) to cohort 2 (8 mg/kg/day) to cohort 3 (16 mg/kg/day). Adherence and adverse event (AE) monitoring was conducted at 2-week intervals during drug administration. Safety profile, difference in number, and percent change in colorectal polyps were compared among the four treatments (placebo and the three dose-escalation groups). RESULTS: Eighteen subjects completed drug dosing and both colonoscopies. Median age was 12.3 years (56% female). No clinically meaningful differences in AEs were seen between placebo subjects and subjects at any of the three celecoxib doses. Median polyp count at baseline was 31. There was a 39.1% increase in the number of polyps in placebo subjects at month 3, whereas in the highest dose celecoxib group, 16 mg/kg/day, a 44.2% reduction was seen (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib at a dose of 16 mg/kg/day, corresponding to the adult dose of 400 mg BID, is safe, well tolerated, and significantly reduced the number of colorectal polyps in children with FAP.",M2

METHODS: Forty-three patients were operated on before the age of 26 years. Endoscopic aspects, operative data, and complications were analyzed, and the resection specimens were reevaluated. Functional outcome was assessed by telephone questionnaire. RESULTS: Primary ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) was performed in 34 patients with a mean age of 16 years (range, 7-25 years). Primary ileal-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) was performed in 9 patients at a mean age of 19 years (range, 15-24 years). Secondary excision of the rectum was performed in 7 patients. Overall, rectal carcinoma was present in 4 patients, at the age of 35, 36, 37, and 38 years. Two patients, aged 39 and 40 years, died because of invasive carcinoma with distant metastasis. The functional outcome and postoperative complications after both procedures were similar to those described in literature for children with FAP. Most patients did not experience alterations in lifestyle, and there was no urinary incontinence.

20173481,"Ureteric obstruction in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>-associated desmoid disease.PURPOSE: Intra-abdominal desmoid disease is the second leading cause of death in familial adenomatous polyposis patients. The aim of this study was to identify the incidence, management, and outcomes for familial adenomatous polyposis associated intra-abdominal desmoids causing ureteric obstruction. METHODS: Clinical data were abstracted from an institutional review board-approved, prospectively maintained familial polyposis registry. RESULTS: Of 107 patients identified with familial adenomatous polyposis related desmoid disease, 30 (28%) had documented CT scan evidence of ureteric obstruction. There was a 1:2.3 female predominance. Preceding surgery was the most prominent risk factor for development of desmoid disease (28 of 30 patients); 2 patients were diagnosed with desmoids before abdominal surgery. Overall, 11 patients had ureteric obstruction at the time of diagnosis. In the other 19 patients, median time from desmoid diagnosis to ureteric obstruction was 2 years. Pharmacologic management alone was effective in 8 patients. Eighteen patients (60%) underwent retrograde ureteric stent insertion. Five patients (17%) required percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. Three patients (10%) underwent autotransplant of 4 kidneys, and 4 patients (13%) required nephrectomy. One patient underwent ureterolysis, and another underwent ureteric resection with reimplantation. One-third of patients required more than one urologic procedure, and 63% had extensive small-bowel involvement with desmoid. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis associated desmoid disease who develop hydronephrosis require stenting. Complete obstruction may necessitate a nephrostomy. Renal autotransplant is an option for persistent symptomatic obstruction. Physicians treating patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and desmoid disease must be aware of the potential for development of ureteric obstruction and available treatment options.",M2
20166476,"Ileoanal pouch dysfunction and the use of a Medena catheter following hospital discharge.With the advent of new surgical techniques to manage colorectal disease, the number of ileoanal pouch operations has amplified and therefore increased numbers of pouch patients are being discharged into the community setting. Community nurses will now encounter the ileoanal pouch patient and may be required to manage related complications. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileoanal pouch anastomosis (RPC) has become established as the gold standard operation for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and selected patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP). Using a reservoir constructed from small bowel as a substitute rectum is a medical triumph which in the majority of cases improves the quality of life for patients, not only by eradicating disease and preserving anal sphincter function but also by avoiding a permanent ileostomy. Recent investigation into the use of Medena catheterization for pouch dysfunction has found that it is tolerated in the long-term and is associated with satisfactory quality of life in pouch patients with outflow obstruction.",M2
20142744,"Patients' views of surgery and surveillance for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.BACKGROUND: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited condition that requires prophylactic surgery (colectomy) followed by a lifetime program of endoscopic surveillance to prevent colorectal cancer. Patients are normally free of symptoms before surgery but a majority report problems related to bowel function postoperatively. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to gain a deeper understanding of how FAP affects life by exploring patients' view of what it is like living with the illness and being committed to a lifelong screening program. METHODS: Three focus group interviews were conducted, and data were analyzed using descriptive qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in two categories related to the participants' view of living with FAP. The first category was associated with concerns related to the hereditary and lifelong nature of the disease as well as to the prophylactic surgery and the second category was related to patients' ways of managing life. CONCLUSION: Most participants expressed unmet needs, such as lack of healthcare providers with good knowledge about FAP, practical and psychosocial support, FAP educational programs, and organized meetings with other persons with the condition. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: One important aspect of living with FAP shared by the participants concerned ways of managing life concerns, something that healthcare providers caring for patients with FAP should identify and support. Furthermore, continuity of care by health care providers with good knowledge about FAP can be an important way of reducing patient concerns.",M2
20141232,"Gardner syndrome: skin manifestations, differential diagnosis and management.Gardner syndrome is a variant of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) and results in the manifestation of numerous external and internal symptoms including gastrointestinal polyps, osteomas, tumors, and epidermoid cysts. As such, it is highly recommended that physicians conduct full body examinations to catch the key clinical features of the disease when it is suspected. Stemming from a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, Gardner syndrome shares genetic correlations with the FAP phenotype; as a result, it becomes all the more crucial for physicians to be able to discern Gardner syndrome from other differential diagnoses such as Turcot syndrome, FAP, and other attenuated forms of familial polyposis. Fortunately, Gardner syndrome has characteristic polyps in the colon, osteomas, and also exhibits abnormalities in the retinal epithelium that discern it from others. Surgery is the most effective method of management for Gardner syndrome; restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis with mucosectomy is the top choice for colonic malignancies, and skin manifestations can be treated through a variety of excisions and therapy depending on location, size, and number of malignancies. Currently, there are no specific screening recommendations for Gardner syndrome, but testing following general screening recommendations for extra-colonic malignancies, genetic counseling, and endoscopy are encouraged.",M2
20113505,"Detection of epithelial apoptosis in pelvic ileal pouches for ulcerative colitis and <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.BACKGROUND: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the surgical procedure of choice for patients with refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) and for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with many rectal polyps. Pouchitis is one of the more frequent complications after IPAA in UC patients; however, it is rare in FAP. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate pro-apoptotic activity in endoscopically and histological normal mucosa of the ileal pouch in patients with UC and FAP. METHODS: Eighteen patients (nine with UC and nine with FAP) with J pouch after total rectocolectomy were studied. Biopsies were obtained from the mucosa of the pouch and from normal ileum. The specimens were snap-frozen and the expressions of Bax and Bcl-2 were determined by immunoblot of protein extracts and by immunohistochemistry analysis. FADD, Caspase-8, APAF-1 and Caspase-9 were evaluated by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot. RESULTS: Patients with UC had significantly higher protein levels of Bax and APAF-1, Caspase-9 than patients with FAP, but were similar to controls. The expressions of Bcl-2 and FADD, Caspase-8 were similar in the groups. Immunohistochemistry for Bax showed less intensity of immunoreactions in FAP than in UC and Controls. Bcl-2 immunostaining was similar among the groups. CONCLUSION: Patients with FAP present lower levels of pro-apoptotic proteins in all methods applied, even in the absence of clinical and endoscopic pouchitis and dysplasia in the histological analysis. These findings may explain a tendency of up-regulation of apoptosis in UC patients, resulting in higher rates of progression to pouchitis in these patients, which could correlate with mucosal atrophy that occurs in inflamed tissue. However, FAP patients had low pro-apoptotic activity in the mucosa, and it could explain the tendency to low cell turn over and presence of adenomas in this syndrome.",M2
20082463,"Birth incidence and prevalence of tumor-prone syndromes: estimates from a UK family genetic register service.Autosomal dominantly inherited tumor-prone syndromes are a substantial health problem and are amenable to epidemiologic studies by combining cancer surveillance registries with a genetic register (GR)-based approach. Knowledge of the frequency of the conditions provides a basis for appropriate health-resources allocations. GRs for five tumor-prone syndromes were established in the Manchester region of North West England in 1989 and 1990. Mapping birth dates of affected individuals from families onto regional birth rates has allowed an estimate of birth incidence, disease prevalence, and de novo mutation rates. Disease prevalence in order of frequency were for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): 1 in 4,560; <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP): 1 in 18,976; nevoid basal cell carcinoma [Gorlin syndrome (GS)]: 1 in 30,827; neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) 1 in 56,161; and von Hippel Lindau (VHL) 1 in 91,111. Best estimates for birth incidence were: 1 in 2,699; 1 in 8,619; 1 in 14,963, 1 in 33,000; and 1 in 42,987, respectively. The proportions due to de novo mutation were: 42% (NF1); 16% (FAP); 26% (GS); 56% (NF2); and 21% (VHL). Estimates for NF1, NF2, FAP, and VHL are in line with previous estimates, and we provide the first estimates of birth incidence and de novo mutation rate for GS.",M2
20027680,"Wireless capsule endoscopy in detecting small-intestinal polyps in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.AIM: To detect the prevalence of small bowel polyps by wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). METHODS: We examined prospectively 14 patients with FAP to assess the location, size and number of small-intestinal polyps. Patients' age, sex, years of observation after surgery, type of surgery, duodenal polyps and colorectal cancer at surgery were analyzed. RESULTS: During WCE, polyps were detected in 9/14 (64.3%) patients. Duodenal adenomatous polyps were found in nine (64.3%) patients, and jejunal and ileal polyps in seven (50%) and eight (57.1%), respectively. The Spigelman stage of duodenal polyposis was associated with the presence of jejunal and ileal polyps. Identification of the ampulla of Vater was not achieved with WCE. Importantly, the findings of WCE had no immediate impact on the further clinical management of FAP patients. No procedure-related complications were observed in the patients. CONCLUSION: WCE is a promising noninvasive new method for the detection of small-intestinal polyps. Further investigation is required to determine which phenotype of FAP is needed for surveillance with WCE.",M2
20001717,"Clinical features and genetic predisposition to hereditary nonmedullary thyroid cancer.BACKGROUND: Approximately 5% of the nonmedullary thyroid cancers are hereditary. Hereditary nonmedullary thyroid cancer may occur as a minor component of familial cancer syndromes (<e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, Gardner's syndrome, Cowden's disease, Carney's complex type 1, Werner's syndrome, and papillary renal neoplasia) or as a primary feature (familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer [FNMTC]). The goal of this article was to review our current knowledge on the hereditary nonmedullary thyroid cancer. SUMMARY: Epidemiologic and clinical kindred studies have demonstrated that FNMTC is a unique clinical entity. Most studies suggest that FNMTC is associated with more aggressive disease than sporadic cases, with higher rates of multicentric tumors, lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal invasion, and shorter disease-free survival. A hereditary predisposition to nonmedullary thyroid cancer is well established, but the susceptibility genes for isolated FNMTC have not been identified. However, additional susceptibility loci for FNMTC have been recently identified in classic isolated cases of FNMTC (1q21, 6q22, 8p23.1-p22, and 8q24). CONCLUSIONS: More studies are needed to validate chromosomal susceptibility loci and identify the susceptibility genes for FNMTC. The discovery of the predisposing genes may allow for screening and early diagnosis, which could lead to improved outcomes for patients and their families.",M2
19966865,"Contribution of the 15 amino acid repeats of truncated APC to beta-catenin degradation and selection of APC mutations in colorectal tumours from FAP patients.The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein is a negative regulator of the mitogenic transcription factor beta-catenin by stimulating its proteasomal degradation. This involves several APC domains, including the binding sites for axin/conductin, the recently described beta-Catenin Inhibitory Domain (CID) and the third 20 amino acid repeat (20R3) that is a beta-catenin-binding site. The four 15 amino acid repeats (15R) and the 20R1 are also beta-catenin-binding sites, but their role in beta-catenin degradation has remained unclear. We show here that binding of beta-catenin to the 15R of APC is necessary and sufficient to target beta-catenin for degradation whereas binding to the 20R1 is neither necessary nor sufficient. The first 15R displays the highest affinity for beta-catenin in the 15R-20R1 module. Biallelic mutations of the APC gene lead tocolon cancer in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> coli (FAP) and result in the synthesis of truncated products lacking domains involved in beta-catenin degradation but still having a minimal length. The analysis of the distribution of truncating mutations along the APC sequence in colorectal tumours from FAP patients revealed that the first 15R is one target of the positive selection of mutations that lead to tumour development.",M2
19966610,"Polishing the crystal ball: knowing genotype improves ability to predict desmoid disease in patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.INTRODUCTION: Desmoid disease occurs in one third of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Patients may be protected by changing surgical strategy. We designed a formula to predict desmoid risk and tested the value of adding genotype to the formula. METHODS: A desmoid risk factor was calculated by summing points awarded for gender (male = 1, female = 3), extracolonic manifestations (nil = 1, one = 2, &gt;one = 3), and family history of desmoids (negative = 1, one relative = 2, more than one relative = 3). Performance of the score with and without genotype (5' 1309 = 1, 1309-1900 = 2, 3' 1900 = 3) was analyzed. RESULTS: There were 839 patients (138 desmoids) without genotype and 154 (30 desmoids) with genotype. The mean desmoid risk factor score of patients without desmoids (no genotype) was 4.7 (+/-1.4 SD) and for patients with desmoid the desmoid risk factor was 6.0 (+/-1.7, P &lt; 0.001). Corresponding data for patients with genotype was 6.1 +/- 1.3 (no desmoids) and 8.4 +/- 1.8 with desmoids (P &lt; 0.001). Of patients without genotype, 648 patients were at low risk and 9.9% had desmoid disease, 178 patients were at medium risk and 34% had desmoids, and 10 patients were at high risk and all had desmoids. Of those with genotype information, 83 patients were at low risk and 5% had desmoids, 52 patients were at medium risk and 21% had desmoids, and 18 patients were at high risk and 83% had desmoids. CONCLUSION: The desmoid risk factor identifies patients with various levels of risk for developing desmoid disease, and can be used to plan surgical strategies designed to minimize desmoid risk.",M2
19953527,"MUTYH mutations associated with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>: functional characterization by a mammalian cell-based assay.MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is a colorectal cancer syndrome, due to biallelic mutations of MUTYH. This Base Excision Repair gene encodes for a DNA glycosylase that specifically mitigates the high mutagenic potential of the 8-hydroxyguanine (8-oxodG) along the DNA. Aim of this study was to characterize the biological effects, in a mammalian cell background, of human MUTYH mutations identified in MAP patients (137insIW [c.411_416dupATGGAT; p.137insIleTrp]; R171W [c.511C&gt;T; p.Arg171Trp]; E466del [c.1395_1397delGGA; p.Glu466del]; Y165C [c.494A&gt;G; p.Tyr165Cys]; and G382D [c.1145G&gt;A; p.Gly382Asp]). We set up a novel assay in which the human proteins were expressed in Mutyh(-/-) mouse defective cells. Several parameters, including accumulation of 8-oxodG in the genome and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, were then used to evaluate the consequences of MUTYH expression. Human proteins were also obtained from Escherichia coli and their glycosylase activity was tested in vitro. The cell-based analysis demonstrated that all MUTYH variants we investigated were dysfunctional in Base Excision Repair. In vitro data complemented the in vivo observations, with the exception of the G382D mutant, which showed a glycosylase activity very similar to the wild-type protein. Our cell-based assay can provide useful information on the significance of MUTYH variants, improving molecular diagnosis and genetic counseling in families with mutations of uncertain pathogenicity.",M2
19946237,"Magnified endoscopic observation using narrow-band imaging of periampullary adenoma in a patient with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.BACKGROUND: Adenoma of the major papilla carries a relatively high risk of malignant transformation to carcinoma, the leading cause of death in patients with familiar adenomatous polyposis (FAP) after colectomy. CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old man had undergone prophylactic colectomy for FAP 3 years earlier. On the forward-viewing and side-viewing endoscopy done for surveillance, the overlying mucosa of the major papilla showed even granularity. On magnifying duodenoscopy using a narrow-band system (NBI), which uses modified optical filters and yields clear images of fine surface structures on the mucosal layer, a compact formation of round pits was seen in the affected ampulla. The microvascular architecture on NBI magnification showed no abnormalities, such as dilated, tortuous or network-like vessels, suggestive of malignancy. On endoscopic retrograde pancreaticocholangiography there was no intraductal growth, and endoscopic ultrasonography showed confinement to the mucosal layer. The ampullary lesion was completely resected using endoscopic snare papillectomy. Histopathological examination of the removed specimen showed tubular adenoma without malignant foci. The patient's post-treatment course was uneventful and without complications, and no local recurrence was noted on repeat endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, endoscopic surveillance and removal of ampullary adenomas appear to be justified.",M2
19937474,"Long-term outcome of metachronous rectal cancer following ileorectal anastomosis for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.BACKGROUND: Total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) carries a potential risk of metachronous cancer in the residual rectum. This study evaluated the risk of cancer development in the residual rectum. METHODS: Ninety-six patients who underwent initial surgery for prevention and cure of FAP were studied, and a clinicopathologic comparison was conducted between 59 patients who underwent IRA and 24 who underwent total proctocolectomy. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rates were 94% after IRA and 95% after total proctocolectomy with no significant difference. The incidence of dense-type rectal polyps (4/17, 24%) was significantly higher in patients who developed metachronous rectal cancer following IRA compared to that in patients who did not (1/39, 3%). Moreover, 60% of patients with dense-type colon polyps developed metachronous rectal cancer compared to 24% in patients without and 80% of those with dense type rectal polyps developed metachronous rectal cancer compared to 25% without. Endoscopic surveillance of the eight Tis or T1 patients was performed at intervals of 6 months to 1 year after IRA but was not performed in three T3 patients for more than 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Effective IRA requires selection of patients without invasive rectal cancer and without dense rectal polyps in whom long-term postoperative follow-up of the residual rectum is possible.",M2
19937191,"Completion mucosectomy for retained rectal mucosa following restorative proctocolectomy with double-stapled ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.INTRODUCTION: Colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis has become widely accepted and is now considered the procedure of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) as well as <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP). DISCUSSION: The clear patient advantage of functional continence has pushed this procedure to the forefront in treating both UC and FAP. As a result, the procedure continues to evolve with recent debate centering on the question of whether to perform a double-stapled technique without rectal mucosectomy or a handsewn anastomosis following transanal mucosectomy. Although continence and complication rates continue to be hotly debated, it is understood that performing the stapled procedure does leave a rectal cuff, which carries with it the possibility of disease persistence or recurrence. As such, if the rectal cuff becomes symptomatic or dysplastic, it must be removed. This is accomplished by performing a transanal completion mucosectomy and reconstructing the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.",M2
19908178,"[Current diagnosis and treatment of desmoid tumours in patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> - the surgical view]Based on a representative selection of relevant references, the aim of this study was to reflect the change of the algorithm in the surgical management of desmoid tumours (DT) in cases of accompanying familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Main focus is concerned with the basics of differential treatment, including additional considerations on epidemiology, diagnosis, outcome and follow-up. DT are rare benign tumours that do not metastasise but tend to invade locally. In contrast to the general population, DT in patients with FAP are more common, show a different pattern of tumour sites and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Most DT occur in the abdominal cavity and account for the majority of serious problems. Genetic disposition and hormonal factors as well as prior surgical trauma are considered causative for the development of DT. Characteristic symptoms are abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting but DT may also present as acute abdomen. CT scan determines localisation and extension of the tumour. Treatment includes various strategies of medication, surgical resection and radiation. Data concerning diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are based on studies with small case series or case reports only. Therefore data from international multicentre studies are necessary for improving the prognosis and developing reliable and stringent guidelines.",M2
19847890,"Genome-wide scan identifies a copy number variable region at 3q26 that regulates PPM1L in APC mutation-negative familial colorectal cancer patients.<e>Familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) is an autosomal dominantly inherited form of colorectal cancer (CRC) caused by mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. However, APC mutations are not detected in 10-50% of FAP patients. We searched for a new cancer gene by performing genome-wide genotyping on members of an APC mutation-negative FAP variant family and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. No common copy number change was found in all affected members using the unaffected members and healthy controls as baseline. A 111 kb copy number variable (CNV) region at 3q26.1 was shown to have copy number loss in all eight polyps compared to matched lymphocytes of two affected members. A common region of loss in all polyps, which are precursors to CRC, is likely to harbor disease-causing gene in accordance to Knudsen's  two-hit  hypothesis. There is, however, no gene within the deleted region. A 2-Mb scan of the genomic region encompassing the deleted region identified PPM1L, coding for a novel serine-threonine phosphatase in the TGF-beta and BMP signaling pathways. Real-time PCR analyses indicate that the 3'UTR of PPM1L transcript was down-regulated more than two-folds in all six polyps and tumors compared to matched mucosa of the affected member. This down-regulation was not observed in APC mutation-positive FAP patients. Our results suggest that the CNV region at 3q26 harbors an element that regulates the expression of an upstream candidate tumor suppressor, PPM1L, thus providing a novel mechanism for colorectal tumorigenesis in APC mutation-negative familial CRC patients.",M2

19822006,"<e>Familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is characterized by the development of many tens to thousands of adenomas in the rectum and colon during the second decade of life. FAP has an incidence at birth of about 1/8,300, it manifests equally in both sexes, and accounts for less than 1% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases. In the European Union, prevalence has been estimated at 1/11,300-37,600. Most patients are asymptomatic for years until the adenomas are large and numerous, and cause rectal bleeding or even anemia, or cancer develops. Generally, cancers start to develop a decade after the appearance of the polyps. Nonspecific symptoms may include constipation or diarrhea, abdominal pain, palpable abdominal masses and weight loss. FAP may present with some extraintestinal manifestations such as osteomas, dental abnormalities (unerupted teeth, congenital absence of one or more teeth, supernumerary teeth, dentigerous cysts and odontomas), congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), desmoid tumors, and extracolonic cancers (thyroid, liver, bile ducts and central nervous system). A less aggressive variant of FAP, attenuated FAP (AFAP), is characterized by fewer colorectal adenomatous polyps (usually 10 to 100), later age of adenoma appearance and a lower cancer risk. Some lesions (skull and mandible osteomas, dental abnormalities, and fibromas on the scalp, shoulders, arms and back) are indicative of the Gardner variant of FAP. Classic FAP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and results from a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis (APC) gene. Most patients (~70%) have a family history of colorectal polyps and cancer. In a subset of individuals, a MUTYH mutation causes a recessively inherited polyposis condition, MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), which is characterized by a slightly increased risk of developing CRC and polyps/adenomas in both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Diagnosis is based on a suggestive family history, clinical findings, and large bowel endoscopy or full colonoscopy. Whenever possible, the clinical diagnosis should be confirmed by genetic testing. When the APC mutation in the family has been identified, genetic testing of all first-degree relatives should be performed. Presymptomatic and prenatal (amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling), and even preimplantation genetic testing is possible. Referral to a geneticist or genetic counselor is mandatory. Differential diagnoses include other disorders causing multiple polyps (such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, familial juvenile polyps or hyperplastic polyposis, hereditary mixed polyposis syndromes, and Lynch syndrome). Cancer prevention and maintaining a good quality of life are the main goals of management and regular and systematic follow-up and supportive care should be offered to all patients. By the late teens or early twenties, colorectal cancer prophylactic surgery is advocated. The recommended alternatives are total proctocolectomy and ileoanal pouch or ileorectal anastomosis for AFAP. Duodenal cancer and desmoids are the two main causes of mortality after total colectomy, they need to be identified early and treated. Upper endoscopy is necessary for surveillance to reduce the risk of ampullary and duodenal cancer. Patients with progressive tumors and unresectable disease may respond or stabilize with a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery (when possible to perform). Adjunctive therapy with celecoxib has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency in patients with FAP. Individuals with FAP carry a 100% risk of CRC; however, this risk is reduced significantly when patients enter a screening-treatment program.",M2
19818784,"The intestinal nuclear receptor signature with epithelial localization patterns and expression modulation in tumors.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The WNT-adenomatous polyposis coli system controls cell fate in the intestinal epithelium, where compartment-specific genes tightly regulate proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Nuclear receptors are transcription factors functioning as sensors of hormones and nutrients that are known to contribute to colon cancer progression. Here we mapped the messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance and the epithelial localization of the entire nuclear receptor family in mouse and human intestine. METHODS: We used complementary high-resolution in situ hybridization and systematic real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in samples of normal distal ileum and proximal colon mucosa and tumors obtained from mouse and human adenomatous polyposis coli-initiated tumor models (ie, Apc(Min/+) mice and <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> patients) and in cellular models of human colon cancer. RESULTS: We first defined for each receptor an expression pattern based on its transcript localization in the distal ileum and the proximal colon. Then, we compared the mRNA levels between normal intestinal epithelium and neoplastic intestinal tissue. After analyzing the correspondence between mouse and human tumor samples plus genetically modified human colon cancer cells, we used complementary graphic and statistical approaches to present a comprehensive overview with several classification trees for the nuclear hormone receptor intestinal transcriptome. CONCLUSIONS: We defined the intestinal nuclear hormone receptor map, which indicates that the localization pattern of a receptor in normal intestine predicts the modulation of its expression in tumors. Our results are useful to select those nuclear receptors that could be used eventually as early diagnostic markers or targeted for clinical intervention in intestinal polyposis and cancer.",M2

However, the use of PND and PGD is controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate attitudes toward, and experiences with, childhood DNA testing, PND and PGD among members of families at high risk for FAP. In this nationwide, cross-sectional study, questionnaires were sent to individuals from families at high risk for FAP assessing attitudes toward and experiences with childhood testing, PND and PGD, as well as several sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial variables. Of the individuals from FAP families invited to participate in the study, 525 members participated (response rate=64%). Most parents who had children who were minors (n=93) (82%) were satisfied with the DNA testing procedure. One-third of all individuals wanted DNA testing for their children before age 12. Forty percent of FAP patients indicated that the disease influenced their desire to have children. Only 15% considered termination of pregnancy for FAP acceptable. Approximately 30% of individuals with a FAP diagnosis and their partners considered PND and PGD as acceptable for themselves. A positive attitude was associated with higher levels of guilt and a positive attitude toward termination of pregnancy. Importantly, of those with FAP at childbearing age, 84% had had no previous information at all about either PND or PGD. Future efforts should be aimed at educating FAP family members about reproductive options, allowing them to make an informed choice about family planning. Routine discussion of all reproductive options with a medical specialist should be encouraged.",M2

It affects the gastrointestinal tract as the largest immune organ with a wide spectrum of symptoms and signs. We present a case of nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH) of the small intestine in a 31-year-old man admitted for evaluation of chronic diarrhea. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed multiple polyps in the stomach, duodenum, ileum, and large intestine mimicking familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Although he had no history of recurrent infection, immunological profiles were in favor of CVID. We emphasize the importance of considering CVID in any patient with gastrointestinal manifestations even in the absence of recurrent bacterial infections.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the possible associations between cPLA ( 2 )alpha gene polymorphisms and phenotypic features of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-based genotype-phenotype association study of the cPLA ( 2 )alpha gene was conducted in 73 Japanese patients from 59 families with FAP. Based on the HapMap database, seven tag SNPs of the cPLA ( 2 )alpha gene were selected and genotyped by direct sequencing analysis. The genotype-phenotype association in relation to the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation was also assessed. RESULTS: The single SNP analysis showed that rs3820185 C allele [odds ratio (OR), 2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-4.9] and rs127446200 GG genotype (OR, 10.9; 95%CI, 1.6-69.8), were more frequent in patients with gastric fundic gland polyposis (FGP) than in those without. Rs12749354 C allele was more frequently found in patients with small intestinal adenoma (OR, 7.0; 95% CI, 1.5-30.4; p = 0.008). This association was also significant when adjusted for covariates (age, sex, and APC mutation) in a logistic regression analysis (adjusted OR, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.2-64.2; p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: The cPLA ( 2 )alpha gene may be a possible disease modifier gene in FAP.",M2

Although the risk of cancer developing in an ileal pouch is not yet clear, a few cases of adenocarcinoma arising in an ileal pouch have been reported. We report a case of adenocarcinoma in ileal pouch after proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. A 56-yr-old woman was diagnosed as having familial adenomatous polyposis. Total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was performed. Six years later, she underwent completion-proctectomy with ileal J pouch-anal anastomosis including anorectal mucosectomy for rectal cancer. After 7 yr, she presented with anal spotting. Endoscopic biopsies revealed adenocarcinoma at the ileal pouch. Resection of the ileal pouch and permanent ileostomy were performed. The risk of cancer in an ileal pouch and its prevention with regular surveillance must be emphasized.",M2
19793576,"Role of surgery in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome).Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for patients who develop colorectal cancer (CRC) in the setting of a hereditary CRC syndrome. In patients with a hereditary CRC syndrome, surgery can be prophylactic, therapeutic with curative intent, and, in some cases, palliative. The type and extent of surgical resection in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and in the Lynch syndrome is influenced by differences in the natural history of carcinogenesis between the two syndromes and by the effectiveness of and patient compliance with available surveillance strategies. In this article, the surgical options for the management of patients with FAP and Lynch syndrome are discussed.",M2

19793053,"APC or MUTYH mutations account for the majority of clinically well-characterized families with FAP and AFAP phenotype and patients with more than 30 adenomas.Patients presenting <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP), attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP) or multiple colorectal adenomas (MCRAs) phenotype are clinically difficult to distinguish. We aimed to genetically characterize 107 clinically well-characterized patients with FAP-like phenotype, and stratified according to the recent guidelines for the clinical management of FAP: FAP, AFAP, MCRA (10-99 colorectal adenomas) without family history of colorectal cancer or few adenomas (FH), MCRA (10-99) with FH, MCRA (3-9) with FH. Overall, APC or MUTYH mutations were detected in 42/48 (88%), 14/20 (70%) and 10/38 (26%) of FAP, AFAP and MCRA patients, respectively. APC and MUTYH mutations accounted for 81% and 7% of FAP patients and for 30% and 40% of AFAP patients, respectively. Notably, MCRA patients did not present APC mutations. In 26% of these patients, an MUTYH mutation was identified and the detection rate increased with the number of adenomas, irrespectively of family history, being significantly higher in MCRA patients presenting more than 30 adenomas [7/12 (58%) vs 2/14 (14%), p = 0.023]. We validate the recently proposed guidelines in our patient's cohort and show that APC or MUTYH germline defects are responsible for the majority of clinically well-characterized patients with FAP and AFAP phenotype, and patients with more than 30 colorectal adenomas. The different mutation frequencies according to family history and to the number of adenomas underscore the importance of an adequate familial characterization, both clinically and by colonoscopy, in the management of FAP-like phenotypes. The phenotypes of the mutation-negative patients suggest distinct etiologies in these cases.",M2
19789369,"Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic surgery for duodenal cancer in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.BACKGROUND: Duodenal cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in familial adenomatous polyposis after colorectal cancer. The lifetime risk for developing duodenal cancer is 4% to 10%. Current treatment guidelines recommend endoscopic surveillance with a prophylactic pancreaticoduodenectomy in advanced duodenal polyposis, defined using the Spigelman staging system. Because no clinical trials have assessed this recommendation, a modeling approach was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various treatment strategies. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the life expectancy and cost of three different strategies: pancreaticoduodenectomy at Spigelman stage III, pancreaticoduodenectomy at Spigelman stage IV, and pancreaticoduodenectomy at cancer diagnosis. A cohort of 30-year-old familial adenomatous polyposis patients with total colectomies was simulated until age 80. The analysis was from a societal perspective. Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of model uncertainty on results. RESULTS: At all stages of polyposis and all ages &lt;80 years, prophylactic surgery at Spigelman stage IV resulted in the greatest life expectancy. Surgery at stage IV was more effective and more expensive than surgery at cancer diagnosis, with an incremental cost of $3,200 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Surgery at stage III was not a viable option. The results were robust to wide variation in model parameters but were sensitive to the post-pancreaticoduodenectomy quality of life score. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic pancreaticoduodenectomy at stage IV duodenal polyposis in familial adenomatous polyposis is a cost-effective approach that results in greater life expectancy than surgery at either stage III or cancer diagnosis.",M2

The high probability to develop CRC in these groups may, at the time of recognition, change surgical management, including its timing or even the surgical technique. In some cases prophylactic surgery can play an important role. The possibility of using tools that allow recognition of the aforementioned syndromes, including microsatellite instability, immunohistochemistry for DNA mismatch repair system proteins, and especially their mutations, is on the basis of therapeutic strategies that differ from those employed in sporadic CRC cases.",M2
19764401,"[Current methods in diagnostics and monitoring of patients with hereditary polyposis syndromes. Investigation of the small intestine]BACKGROUNDS: Familial polypous syndromes include, in particular, <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and familial juvenile polyposis. The cumulative risk of developing cancer of the small intestine is higher and ranges between 5 to 13%. Close follow-up is therefore very important in the prevention of both malignant and benign complications of the basic disease. Currently there are many methods that can be offered to follow up patients with hereditary polyposis syndromes.The anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract can be investigated by endoscopy or double-contrast radiological techniques. The part of the small intestine between the duodenum and terminal ileum is difficult to reach by standard endoscopy and can only be judged by radiological enteroclysis, which has the disadvantage of exposing the patient to X-rays, moreover, it is impossible to examine the pathological findings histologically. However, new and more accurate enteroscopical (single and double-balloon, including intraoperative) methods and capsule enteroscopy have recently started to be used in routine clinical practice: Capsule endoscopy is an endoscopical method that enables us to examine the whole small intestine.This technology consists of swallowing a capsule the size of a bean that is later moved by motility of the gastrointestinal tract distally. A doctor then evaluates the record. Intraoperative enteroscopy is ever more often substituted by balloon enteroscopy. However, it remains a possibility when traditional double-balloon enteroscopy does not solve the patient's problems definitely; this occurs mainly in patients with intestinal adhesions or multiple lesions of the small intestine, endoscopically insolvable. Balloon enteroscopy is a modern endoscopic method that is used to examine the whole small intestine that also enables therapeutic efforts to be carried out when routine endoscopy is not successful. In some indications it has substituted intraoperative enteroscopy. CONCLUSION: These three methods are complementary, are connected in the examination algorithm and cannot be replaced by each other. Some authors consider them the golden standard in investigating the small intestine.",M2

19760114,"The challenge of developmentally appropriate care: predictive genetic testing in young people for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.Predictive genetic tests for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are routinely offered to young people during early adolescence. While this is not controversial, due to the medical benefit conferred by the test, it is nonetheless challenging as a consequence of the stage of life of the young people, and the simultaneous involvement of multiple family members. Despite these challenges, it is possible to ensure that the test is offered in such a way that it actively acknowledges and facilitates young people's developing autonomy and psychosocial well-being. In this paper we present findings from ten in-depth interviews with young people who have undergone predictive genetic testing for FAP (four male, six female; five gene-positive, five gene-negative; aged 10-17 years at the time of their predictive test; aged 12-25 years at the time of their research interview). We present five themes that emerged from the interviews which highlight key ethical challenges associated with such testing. These are: (1) the significance of the test; (2) young people's lack of involvement in the decision to be tested; (3) young people's limited understanding; (4) provision of the blood test at the first visit; and (5) group testing of family members. We draw on these themes to make eight recommendations for future practice. Together, these recommendations highlight the importance of providing developmentally appropriate care to young people undergoing predictive genetic testing for FAP.",M2

To further explore intestinal regional responses, we studied effects of sulindac on additional gene-targeted mouse models of human intestinal tumorigenesis; these were (i) Apc(1638N/+) mouse (chain termination mutation in exon 15 of the Apc gene); (ii) Mlh1(+/-) mouse (DNA mismatch repair deficiency, a mouse model of human hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer) and (iii) double-heterozygous Mlh1(+/-)Apc(1638N/+) mutant mouse. Mice were fed AIN-76A control diet with or without 0.02% sulindac for 6 months. Intestinal regional tumor incidence, multiplicity, volume and degree of inflammation were used as end points. The results showed the following: (i) sulindac inhibited tumor development in the small intestine of Apc(1638N/+) mice; (ii) in contrast, sulindac increased tumors in the small intestine of Mlh1 mutant mice, a neoplastic effect which persisted in heterozygous compound Mlh1(+/-)Apc(1638N/+) mutant mice; (iii) sulindac increased tumors in the cecum of all mice regardless of genetic background; (iv) sulindac decreased inflammation in the small intestine of Apc(1638N/+) mice, but it increased inflammation in the small intestine of Mlh1(+/-) mice and Mlh1(+/-)Apc(1638N/+) mice and (v) sulindac enhanced inflammation in the cecum of all mutant mice. Findings indicate that the effects of sulindac in the intestine of these mutant mouse models are probably related to genetic background and appear to be associated with its inflammatory-inducing response.",M2
19732775,"Expanded extracolonic tumor spectrum in MUTYH-associated polyposis.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is characterized by a lifetime risk of colorectal cancer of up to 100%. However, no systematic evaluation of extracolonic manifestations has been reported. METHODS: A large cohort of MAP patients was recruited from a European multicenter study. Data were collected on 276 cases from 181 unrelated families. Information on extracolonic tumor spectrum and incidence were evaluated to determine cumulative lifetime risk, which was compared with that of the general population to obtain standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). RESULTS: Duodenal polyposis occurred in 17% of cases; the relative risk (SIR) of duodenal cancer was 129 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16-466), whereas the lifetime risk was 4%. The incidence of extraintestinal malignancies among cases was almost twice that of the general population (SIR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4-2.5), with a lifetime risk of 38%. We observed a significant increase in the incidence of ovarian, bladder, and skin cancers (SIR: 5.7, 7.2, and 2.8, respectively) and a trend of increased risk of breast cancer among cases. The median ages of onset of these 4 malignancies ranged from 51 to 61 years. In contrast to <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, no desmoid tumors were observed, but sebaceous gland tumors, characteristic of the Muir-Torre variant of Lynch syndrome, occurred in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The relative risks for several extraintestinal malignancies increased in patients with MAP, but based on the spectrum of cancers (which overlaps with that of Lynch syndrome) and the relatively advanced age at onset, intensive surveillance measures other than frequent endoscopy are unlikely to be helpful to patients with MAP.",M2

19690495,"Restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in children.PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the results of restorative proctocolectomy with distal rectal mucosectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in children. METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of 100 consecutively referred children (&lt;18 years old) who underwent reconstruction with a J-pouch of ileum and preservation of the transitional anorectal epithelium by the same two-surgeon team. Temporary diverting ileostomy was used. The main outcome measures were daytime and nocturnal fecal continence, bowel movements per day, and complications including pouchitis, ileoanal stricture, or postoperative small-bowel obstruction. RESULTS: Average age of the 100 children (48 males/52 females) was 13.2 years (range, 2.95-17.99). All 25 children with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> had proctocolectomy and reconstruction performed simultaneously. Of 75 children with ulcerative colitis, 50 (67%) had their colectomy followed by reconstruction after an interval ranging from 2 months to 4.4 years. Median postoperative follow-up was 2.6 years. Daytime fecal continence was achieved in 98 children, although 4 reported rare accidents. Nighttime continence was achieved in 93 children, of whom 14 reported rare accidents. The average frequency of bowel movements was 5.43/day (+/-2.22). Only one child with polyposis had pouchitis. Of 75 children with ulcerative colitis, 35 had symptoms consistent with pouchitis; of these 35 children, 10 required prolonged treatment. The most frequent postoperative complication was ileoanal stricture requiring operative dilatation and/or anoplasty (18 children). Bowel obstruction requiring surgery occurred in 18 children. One child eventually required pouchectomy for probable Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent results can be achieved with restorative proctocolectomy in children with respect to fecal continence and stool frequency. However, with ulcerative colitis, a substantial risk of pouchitis remains.",M2
19690494,"Adrenal incidentaloma in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>: a long-term follow-up study and schema for management.PURPOSE: Adrenal incidentaloma is often diagnosed in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, because they frequently undergo abdominal imaging and have a raised incidence of adrenal incidentaloma. This study investigates the natural history of adrenal incidentaloma in familial adenomatous polyposis, and suggests a schema for management. METHODS: An original cohort of 14 familial adenomatous polyposis patients with adrenal incidentaloma, identified prospectively 12 years ago, was followed up clinically and radiologically. A further group of 16 patients was also identified. All had lesions &gt;1 cm. For both cohorts, characteristics of patients (genotype, age at diagnosis, concomitant diagnoses) and incidentaloma (size, laterality, rate of growth, outcome) are described. RESULTS: Overall, 3 of 30 patients underwent adrenalectomy; one patient had pheochromocytoma and another had an adenoma of borderline malignancy. A further three lesions were radiologically suspicious for malignancy at the time of diagnosis; one was in a patient who was unfit for surgery but died of nonadrenal causes after nine years. None of the lesions radiologically benign at diagnosis showed an aggressive course, but one patient required referral for surgery after 12 years because of a slow increase in size of the lesion. There were no associations with genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Familial adenomatous polyposis-associated adrenal incidentaloma may warrant long-term follow-up. Although the natural history is similar to lesions occurring sporadically, these patients have concomitant familial adenomatous polyposis-associated manifestations under radiologic surveillance. In this rare condition, development of a robust protocol will require evidence from worldwide patient cohorts. However, a tailored schema is suggested as a consistent basis for future modification.",M2
19670132,"High resolution endoscopy and the additional value of chromoendoscopy in the evaluation of duodenal adenomatosis in patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Duodenal polyposis occurs in approximately 90 % of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and 5 % - 10 % develop duodenal cancer. Novel imaging techniques may improve evaluation of duodenal polyposis using the Spigelman classification. We aimed to analyze the value of high resolution endoscopy (HRE) and the additional value of chromoendoscopy in the evaluation of duodenal polyposis in FAP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 43 FAP patients scheduled for surveillance endoscopy in two academic centers underwent gastroduodenoscopy with HRE forward- and side-viewing devices. After number and size of adenomas had been scored, indigo carmine 0.5 % was sprayed onto the mucosa, polyps were scored again and biopsies taken from the larger lesions. Subsequently, Spigelman classifications were assessed for pre- and post-staining. RESULTS: Before staining, a median of 16 adenomas per patient were detected compared with 21 adenomas after staining ( P = 0.02). Staining led to upgrading of Spigelman stage in 5/43 patients (12 %). Using the side-viewing endoscope, ampullary enlargement was detected in 22 patients (51 %) of whom 18 (42 %) had histologically confirmed ampullary adenomas. CONCLUSION: HRE has raised the quality of endoscopic imaging considerably. Consequently, re-evaluation of the original Spigelman classification system seems advisable. Chromoendoscopy further increases detection of duodenal adenomas in FAP but without considerable change in Spigelman stage. Ampullary adenomas are commonly found in FAP and are best visualized using a side-viewing endoscope. Therefore, a combination of forward-viewing HRE and chromoendoscopy with side-viewing endoscopy for the periampullary region seems useful for surveillance of duodenal adenomatosis in FAP.",M2

The aim of this study was to review all the index surgeries for familial adenomatous polyposis performed at our institution to assess the changes in surgical techniques. METHODS: All index abdominal surgeries for polyposis from 1950 to 2007 were identified through the Polyposis Registry Database. We assigned the patients to prepouch (before 1983), pouch (after 1983), and laparoscopic (after 1991) eras, and analyzed the changes in prophylactic surgery. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-four patients were included; 51% were male. Median age at surgery was 26 (range, 9-66) years. In the prepouch era, 97% (66 of 68) of all surgeries and 100% of restorative surgeries were ileorectal anastomosis. After 1983, 70% (54 of 77) of patients with a severe phenotype had an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. After 1991, 110 operations (43%) were laparoscopic (88 ileorectal and 22 ileal pouch-anal anastomosis). CONCLUSION: Colon surgery for familial adenomatous polyposis has evolved as advances in surgical technique have created more options to reduce the risk of cancer. Current strategy uses polyposis severity and distribution to decide on the surgical option, and laparoscopy to minimize morbidity.",M2
19597346,"New perspectives on APC control of cell fate and proliferation in colorectal cancer.Aberrant Wnt/beta-catenin signaling following loss of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is thought to initiate colon adenoma formation. Considerable evidence for this model has come from mouse models of Apc truncation where nuclear beta-catenin is detectable soon after loss of Apc. However, examination of tumors from <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> coli (FAP) patients has failed to confirm the presence of nuclear beta-catenin in early lesions following APC loss despite robust staining in later lesions. This observation presents the possibility that colon adenomas arise through a beta-catenin-independent function of APC. Additionally, there is a well established role for inflammation and specifically COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 in the progression of colorectal cancer. Here we review the current literature regarding the functions of APC in regulating WNT/beta-catenin signaling as well as its control of intestinal cell fate and differentiation. Further, we provide a brief commentary on our current understanding of the role that inflammation plays in colorectal tumorigenesis and how it fits in with APC dysfunction. Though there are currently contrasting models to explain colon tumorigenesis, our goal is to begin to reconcile data from multiple different model systems and provide a functional view into the initiation and progression of colon cancer.",M2

METHODS: Thirteen patients with adenomatous polyposis were examined by total colonoscopy using an instrument that incorporated both narrow-band and autofluorescence imaging. Colonoscopic images were obtained using white light colonoscopy, autofluorescence imaging, narrow-band imaging, and chromoendoscopy. All images were captured at equivalent angles and distances from the colorectal mucosa. RESULTS: Chromoendoscopy detected the greatest number of lesions at all sites within the large intestine, and it detected a significantly greater number than the other procedures on the left side of the large intestine. Narrow-band imaging depicted a greater number of lesions than did white light in the transverse colon, descending colon, and rectum. Autofluorescence imaging showed a greater number of lesions than did white light in the rectum. The total number of depicted lesions under chromoendoscopy (43.3 +/- 38.5) was significantly greater than the total number detected with white light (12.2 +/- 13.9, P = 0.005), autofluorescence imaging (21.4 +/- 27.5, P = 0.0006), and narrow-band imaging (20.1 +/- 21.5, P = 0.003). Narrow-band imaging detected a significantly higher total number of lesions than did white light (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Chromoendoscopy is superior to white light colonoscopy, autofluorescence imaging, and narrow-band imaging for detection of diminutive colorectal lesions in adenomatous polyposis.",M2
19578404,"A targeted constitutive mutation in the APC tumor suppressor gene underlies mammary but not intestinal tumorigenesis.Germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are responsible for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP), an autosomal dominant hereditary predisposition to the development of multiple colorectal adenomas and of a broad spectrum of extra-intestinal tumors. Moreover, somatic APC mutations play a rate-limiting and initiating role in the majority of sporadic colorectal cancers. Notwithstanding its multifunctional nature, the main tumor suppressing activity of the APC gene resides in its ability to regulate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Notably, genotype-phenotype correlations have been established at the APC gene between the length and stability of the truncated proteins encoded by different mutant alleles, the corresponding levels of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activity they encode for, and the incidence and distribution of intestinal and extra-intestinal tumors. Here, we report a novel mouse model, Apc1572T, obtained by targeting a truncated mutation at codon 1572 in the endogenous Apc gene. This hypomorphic mutant allele results in intermediate levels of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activation when compared with other Apc mutations associated with multifocal intestinal tumors. Notwithstanding the constitutive nature of the mutation, Apc(+/1572T) mice have no predisposition to intestinal cancer but develop multifocal mammary adenocarcinomas and subsequent pulmonary metastases in both genders. The histology of the Apc1572T primary mammary tumours is highly heterogeneous with luminal, myoepithelial, and squamous lineages and is reminiscent of metaplastic carcinoma of the breast in humans.

COX-2 has been found overexpressed in (pre)malignant tissues and may be relevant to cancer development. We investigated whether functional genetic polymorphisms in COX-2 may have a risk-modifying effect on duodenal adenomatosis in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Blood from 85 patients with FAP and 218 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects was investigated for the presence of two functional promoter region polymorphisms (-1195G--&gt;A and -765G--&gt;C) in COX-2. Logistic regression analysis revealed an overrepresentation of the -1195GG genotype compared to the -1195AA genotype in patients with FAP (odds ratio = 2.81; 95% CI = 1.00-7.91, p = 0.042). No associations between single COX-2 polymorphisms or COX-2 haplotype were found when patients were evaluated according to their Spigelman stage. The predicted low COX-2 expression genotype -1195GG was found overrepresented in the patients with FAP. The COX-2 genotypes showed no association with the severity of duodenal adenomatosis.",M2
19533554,"Surveillance and treatment of duodenal adenomatosis in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are at increased risk for duodenal cancer whereas colorectal cancer is largely prevented by prophylactic colectomy. We analyzed the results of endoscopic surveillance and different treatment modalities of duodenal adenomatosis in patients with FAP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on endoscopies, histopathological examinations, and surgical therapies were collected from the medical histories of 129 patients with FAP. The cumulative incidences of duodenal adenomatosis and severe dysplasia and cancer were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: By the age of 60 years, the cumulative incidence was 80% for any adenomatosis and 23% for severe dysplasia or cancer. Duodenal cancer was observed in six patients (4.7%). Fifteen endoscopic excisions in 14 patients, and 19 open duodenotomies in 17 patients were carried out. Later, pancreaticoduodenectomy was undertaken in six (35.3%) of these 17 patients. Altogether, 12 patients (9.3%) underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. Except for one patient, the indication for surgery was based on follow-up endoscopies, and none of these patients died of duodenal cancer. No postoperative deaths occurred. Seven patients (58.3%) had major complications, four (33.3%) of which were surgical. CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of severe dysplasia and cancer in duodenal polyps suggests that endoscopic surveillance is essential. Endoscopic polypectomies under sedation anesthesia have partly replaced open duodenotomies. High-risk patients with Spigelman IV adenomatosis or adenomas with persisting severe dysplasia should undergo surgery with pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy before invasive cancer develops.",M2
19502852,"What are the outcomes of reoperative restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis surgery?PURPOSE: Restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the current surgical treatment of choice for most patients with ulcerative colitis. Complications of the ileal pouch may necessitate additional operations to salvage the pouch. The aims of this study were to review the outcomes of reoperative restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis surgery and to define any predictors of successful pouch salvage surgery. METHODS: The medical records of all patients who underwent reoperative ileoanal pouch surgery for either pouch salvage or pouch excision between 1988 and 2007 were reviewed. Successful ileoanal pouch salvage was considered to be an intact functioning pouch, after resolution of problem, with a follow-up of at least six months and good to excellent patient satisfaction and continence. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients underwent reoperation for pouch-related complications (44 mucosal ulcerative colitis, 6 <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, and 1 indeterminate colitis), in addition to 8 patients with Crohn's disease. An additional 17 patients had primary pouch excision. Thirty-eight (74.4 percent) of the 51 patients who underwent pouch salvage had a successful outcome. Twenty-three patients had pouch reconstruction or revision via an abdominal approach with a 69.5 percent success rate. The remainder of patients had local perineal procedures for control of perianal sepsis, with 75 percent success rate. Patients required a mean of 2.1 procedures to achieve pouch salvage; there was no correlation between the number of ileoanal pouch salvage procedures and failure. Crohn's disease was ultimately diagnosed in more than half of the patients who underwent primary pouch excision. Among the patients with Crohn's disease who underwent pouch salvage only three retained their pouches, for a success rate of only 37 percent. CONCLUSION: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis salvage surgery can save a considerable number of patients from pouch excision and permanent ileostomy. Both local perineal and abdominal approaches yield acceptable results. The choice of procedure is based on the etiology and anatomy of the problem and the surgeon's preference and patient-related factors such as diagnosis.",M2
19489673,"Mid-term functional outcome of laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy: a prospective study of 40 consecutive cases.INTRODUCTION: This prospective study aimed to analyze the functional outcome after a two-stage laparoscopic total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 1999 to May 2008, 68 consecutive two-stage laparoscopic total proctocolectomies with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis were performed (ulcerative colitis: n = 61; <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>: n = 7). A covering ileostomy was used in all patients. Forty patients whose covering ileostomy had been closed for a minimum of 2 years were included in this series. RESULTS: Conversion to laparotomy was necessary in 4 of 40 patients (10%). Thirteen postoperative complications occurred in 13 of 40 patients (30%). At a median follow-up of 38 months (range, 26-90), the median number of bowel movements was 4 per 24 hours (range, 2-10); 15 patients (38%) had no nighttime bowel movements. None of the patients had fecal incontinence or urgency. Thirty-four of the 40 patients (85%) experienced no soiling. Seven patients (18%) took regular antidiarrheal medication. All patients were able to resume all activities practiced prior to illness onset, and 36 of 40 (90%) were satisfied with their overall quality of life (very good or good). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis provides satisfying mid-term functional outcome.",M2

19479366,"Psychosocial impact of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> on young adults: a qualitative study.The aim of this study was to explore in detail the psychosocial impact of either having familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or being at risk for FAP amongst young adults. In-depth interviews were conducted with eleven individuals aged 18-35 with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of, or at risk of developing FAP. While being at risk did not seem to have a major psychosocial impact upon clinically unaffected participants, clinically affected individuals discussed a number of major stressors including issues in relation to changes in body image and physical functioning as a result of surgery, concerns about discussing FAP with new partners, difficulties in relation to childbearing decision-making, and impact on employment. Genetic counseling was described as being highly effective in providing support, but most participants were not aware of any other support services. Providing longer-term support through ongoing genetic counseling appears necessary to adequately address the ongoing challenges faced by young adults who are dealing with FAP.",M2
19451089,"Label-free global serum proteomic profiling reveals novel celecoxib-modulated proteins in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> patients.Celecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), was efficacious in clinical prevention trials of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and sporadic colorectal cancer. To identify as yet poorly defined molecular determinants of celecoxib efficacy, a multidimensional serum fractionation approach was used coupled with nanospray tandem mass spectrometry to perform label-free global proteomic profiling of serum samples from the FAP/celecoxib prevention trial. Subsequently, the application of an algorithm for large-scale biomarker discovery on comparative serum proteomic profiles of pre- and post-celecoxib treatment samples identified 83 potentially celecoxib-responsive proteins from various cellular compartments, biological processes and molecular functions. Celecoxib modulation of some of these proteins was confirmed in serum samples of FAP patients and colorectal cancer cell lines by Western blotting. Thus, using a shotgun procedure to rapidly identify important celecoxib-modulated proteins, this pilot study has uncovered novel systemic changes some of which are highly relevant for carcinogenesis and vascular biology. Validation of selected markers, especially those involved in key signaling networks and those considered molecular indicators of cardiovascular pathology, in larger celecoxib clinical trials is expected to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of celecoxib and the efficacy/toxicity issues related to its use as a chemopreventive agent.",M2
19444466,"APC mutation spectrum of Norwegian <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> families: high ratio of novel mutations.INTRODUCTION: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Massive formation of colorectal adenomas, of which some will inevitably develop into adenocarcinomas, is the hallmark of the disease. Characterization of causative APC mutations allows presymptomatic diagnosis, close follow-up and prophylactic intervention in families. To date more than 900 different germline mutations have been characterized worldwide demonstrating allelic heterogeneity. PURPOSE: The germline mutation spectrum of APC identified in 69 apparently unrelated Norwegian FAP families are presented and discussed with reference to clinical phenotype and novel mutation rate. METHODS: Different methods have been used over the years. However, all mutations were confirmed detectable by an implemented denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography screening approach. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis was employed for potential gross rearrangements. RESULTS: Fifty-three distinctive mutations were detected, of which 22 have been detected in Norway exclusively. Except for two major deletion mutations encompassing the entire APC, all mutations resulted in premature truncation of translation caused by non-sense (31%) or change in reading frame (69%). CONCLUSION: A high ratio of novel APC mutations continues to contribute to APC mutation heterogeneity causing FAP. This is the first comprehensive report of APC germline mutation spectrum in Norway.",M2
19427313,"Reduced level of smoothened suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis by down-regulation of Wnt signaling.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Although the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway regulates development and progression of several types of cancer, its involvement in colon cancer remains unclear. We aimed to clarify the roles of Hh signaling in intestinal tumorigenesis. METHODS: We studied expression of the Hh signaling components in the intestinal tumors of Apc(+/Delta716) mouse, a model for <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. We used small interfering RNAs against Smoothened (SMO), which encodes the major signal transducer of the Hh pathway, to knockdown SMO expression and explore its function in human colon cancer cell lines. We also compared the intestinal tumor phenotypes of Apc(+/Delta716)Smo(+/-) mice with those of Apc(+/Delta716) mice. RESULTS: Expression of Smo was markedly increased in the intestinal adenoma epithelium of Apc(+/Delta716) mice. Importantly, SMO knockdown in human colon cancer cell lines suppressed proliferation in culture; cells arrested at the G1/S phase. Furthermore, Apc(+/Delta716)Smo(+/-) mice had decreased numbers of polyps in the large size class (Phi &gt;or= 1-2 mm) and recessed polyp morphology, accompanied by reduced proliferation of the tumor epithelial cells. Unexpectedly, reduced expression of Smo suppressed beta-catenin-dependent transcription, rather than Hh-responsive Gli-dependent transcription. Interestingly, SMO knockdown reduced protein levels of active beta-catenin and induced its nuclear exclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Smo contributes to intestinal tumorigenesis by increasing Wnt signaling. SMO might be a good therapeutic target for patients with colorectal polyps and carcinomas, even in the absence of Hh signal activation.",M2
19415957,"The T1799A BRAF mutation is absent in cribriform-morular variant of papillary carcinoma.CONTEXT: Cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (CMVPTC) is one of the rare types of papillary carcinoma. It has been associated with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, though it can also occur sporadically. The molecular pathogenesis of this tumor is incompletely understood. It appears that there can be molecular contributions from the RET/PTC translocations and from mutations in the APC gene and beta-catenin gene, which are both part of the Wnt signaling pathway. However, one of the most common mutations in papillary carcinoma, the BRAF mutation, has not been reported in this variant of papillary carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the BRAF mutational status in CMVPTC. DESIGN: Four cases of CMVPTC (1 associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and the others apparently sporadic) were identified from the files of 3 large centers. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted and successfully amplified from each case. The polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced and evaluated for the T1799A BRAF mutation. RESULTS: None of the 4 cases harbored the T1799A BRAF mutation (0/4). Conclusions.-The T1799A BRAF mutation does not appear to play a role in the tumorigenesis of CMVPTC.",M2
19414147,"MUTYH-associated polyposis.MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by adenomatous polyps of the colorectum and a very high risk of colorectal cancer. It appears to be at least as prevalent as autosomal dominant <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (that is caused by truncating mutations in the APC gene) with which it shares important gastroenterological features. It was first recognised as recently as 2002 and its full phenotype and natural history are still being characterised. Key extracolonic manifestations include a predisposition to duodenal adenomas and cancer and a modest increase in risk for several extraintestinal tumours. Testing for mutations in the MUTYH gene is indicated in patients who have multiple colorectal adenomas or a family history suggestive of autosomal recessive colorectal cancer and for the siblings and spouses of patients with MAP in order to inform surveillance and treatment for patients and their families.",M2
19414141,"Introduction to molecular and clinical genetics of colorectal cancer syndromes.The understanding of molecular genetics in the field of gastroenterology has rapidly grown over the last two decades. In recent years many genes involved in the disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease have been identified. The elucidation of the molecular genetics of these diseases made it possible to study the high-penetrance susceptibility genes for disease-causing mutations with direct implications for relatives of affected individuals. The most immediate application of these advances is the opportunity of pre-symptomatic diagnosis in relatives of affected individuals by molecular genetic testing. In this article, the most commonly employed mutation detection procedures; the outcome and use of these tests in clinical practice are discussed. We focus on the three most common hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes (CCS): Lynch syndrome, <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and MUTYH-associated polyposis.",M2

19404084,"Aggressive phenotype of MYH-associated polyposis with jejunal cancer and intra-abdominal desmoid tumor: report of a case.MYH-associated polyposis is an inherited autosomal recessive disease, linked to biallelic germline MYH mutations, which predisposes to the development of multiple colorectal adenomas and cancer. The colonic and extracolonic phenotype of this syndrome is very heterogeneous. We report the case of a young male patient with an aggressive MYH-associated polyposis phenotype. He presented at aged 30 years with more than 100 colonic polyps and 4 colonic adenocarcinomas. At aged 35 years, Spigelman Stage IV duodenal adenomatosis was detected. When he was 39 years old, he developed three synchronous jejunal adenocarcinomas and a mesenteric desmoid tumor. Based on this report, we believe that screening of the entire small bowel should be recommended in MYH-associated polyposis patients, especially in those with duodenal adenomas. Similar to patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>, desmoid tumors also may be part of the clinical spectrum of MYH-associated polyposis and may prove to be a significant clinical problem in patients submitted to prophylactic colectomy.",M2
19382100,"Psychological distress and use of psychosocial support in <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.OBJECTIVE: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is characterized by multiple adenomas in the colorectum with a high risk to develop colorectal cancer. It is unclear whether individuals at risk of FAP experience distress due to this potentially life-threatening disease. This nationwide study assessed: (1) the prevalence of psychological distress; and (2) the need for and use of specialized professional psychosocial support. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, all individuals from families at high risk for FAP registered at the Netherlands Foundation for the Detection of Hereditary Tumours were invited to complete a questionnaire assessing, among other issues, generalized, cancer-specific and FAP-specific distress. RESULTS: In total, 525 individuals completed the questionnaire. Approximately 20% of the respondents had moderate to severe levels of FAP-specific distress. Levels of generalized distress were comparable to the general Dutch population. Significantly more individuals with a FAP diagnosis had frequent cancer worries than those at risk of FAP or non-carriers (p=0.02). Distress levels were more strongly associated with psychosocial variables (e.g. perceived cancer risk), than with sociodemographic or clinical variables. Up to 43% of the variance in distress could be explained by all variables combined. Of those moderately to severely distressed, 26% had received specialized professional psychosocial support, while 30% of those did not receive the support they wanted. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial minority of individuals reported moderate to severe distress levels associated with FAP. However, only one-third of those received specialized professional psychosocial support. We recommend the use of a screening questionnaire to identify individuals in need of such support.",M2
19375617,"Interposition of a gastric pouch between ileum and anus after proctocolectomy: long-term results in 3 patients.BACKGROUND: After proctocolectomy, ileal pouch-anal anastomosis may not be feasible, especially in the case of desmoid tumor or after failed ileal pouch-anal anastomosis requiring excision of the pouch. We designed a gastric pouch interposed between the terminal ileum and the anus to avoid a permanent ileostomy for these patients. Long-term results and quality of life with this technique remain unknown. METHODS: After proctocolectomy, ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was not feasible or had failed in 3 patients (2 with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and 1 with ulcerative colitis; 40, 49, and 50 years of age, respectively). Of these patients, 2 had undergone end ileostomy 7 and 8 years previously. A pouch was created using the left half of the gastric fundus, supplied through the right gastroepiploic vessels; the pouch was anastomosed proximally to the terminal ileum and distally to the anus. Diverting ileostomy was performed in all patients. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 6 years, all 3 patients were highly satisfied with the operation and described their quality of life as good. The median stool frequency during the day and night were 6 and 1, respectively. No patient reported incontinence or urgency. Of the 3 patients, 2 had minimal soiling with gastric juice; 1 patient had anastomotic ulcers with bleeding requiring resection with reanastomosis. All of the patients needed long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy and topical perianal treatment to prevent skin burning. CONCLUSION: Inter-ileoanal gastroplasty is a surgical salvage technique that can avoid a permanent ileostomy. The procedure provides a good quality of life for patients with unfeasible or failed ileal pouch.",M2
19358059,"Small-bowel diagnosis in patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>: comparison of push enteroscopy, capsule endoscopy, ileoscopy, and enteroclysis.BACKGROUND: Conventional upper endoscopy (EGD), EGD with side-view endoscope and ileoscopy are established procedures for endoscopic evaluation of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). However, we still have little data on the frequency and relevance of adenomas in those parts of the small bowel which are not accessible to EGD and ileoscopy. Adenomas distal to the duodenum are found more often in FAP patients with known duodenal adenomas. The question is, whether these patients can benefit from additional endoscopic and/or radiographic examinations. METHODS: Between July 2001 and August 2006 we performed comparative small bowel studies with push enteroscopy (PE), capsule endoscopy (CE), ileoscopy (IL) and enteroclysis (EC) in 25 FAP patients known to have duodenal adenomas. The number, size and location of any adenomas detected were documented. RESULTS: PE: The examination revealed duodenal adenomas (max. size 80 mm) requiring treatment in 9 of the 25 patients examined. In 12 of the 25 patients the PE showed adenomas distal to the ligament of Treitz with a maximum size of 15 mm. CE: In 22 of the 23 examined patients the CE revealed adenomas of the small bowel. Thirteen of these 22 patients also had adenomas in regions not accessible to PE or IL. These adenomas had a maximum size of 10 mm. IL: In 12 of the 25 patients adenomas were found in the region of the ileal pouch. The maximum size of the adenomas was 10 mm. EC: In 19 of the 23 examined patients the EC examination produced a false-negative result. in 8 of these 19 patients the adenomas not detected radiologically measured &gt;or= 10 mm. CONCLUSIONS: FAP patients with duodenal adenomas particularly often have adenomas distal to the duodenum. CE is a safe and convenient method for evaluating the small bowel in these patients. EC is considerably inferior to the endoscopic procedures for evaluation of the small bowel and is therefore not suitable for the diagnosis of adenomas in FAP.",M2
19350425,"Functional outcome and quality of life after restorative proctocolectomy and ileo-anal pouch anastomosis.OBJECTIVE: Reconstructive proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP). The aim of our study was to evaluate the functional results of this procedure and to assess its impact upon patient quality of life (QoL). METHODS: We evaluated QoL and functional results in patients who had undergone IPAA using two self-rating questionnaires: 1) Medical Outcome 36 item Health Survey (SF-36); and 2) a specific questionnaire evaluating various aspects of anorectal and urogenital function. RESULTS: 107 patients (median age 38 [range 17-69] years) underwent reconstructive proctocolectomy with IPAA between 1981 and 2002. Median duration of follow-up was 83 (range 4-230) months. 66 patients (61%) answered both questionnaires. Two thirds of patients have more than five bowel movements per day and one bowel movement at night. Whilst true faecal incontinence is exceptional, episodes of soiling are reported by 25% of patients. Regarding QoL in this population, the two scores of the SF-36, which summarise physical and mental health status (Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) were 54.6 and 45.8, respectively (both are 50 in the general population). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that, as measured with SF-36 questionnaire, QoL after IPAA is close to normal. However, good quality of life is not a surrogate for good functional results. Despite excellent control of continence during the day, IPAA is often associated with night time bowel movements and soiling.",M2

19333660,"Prevalence of adenomas and carcinomas in the ileal pouch after proctocolectomy in patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.PURPOSE: Restorative proctocolectomy has become the most common surgical option for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). However, adenomas may develop in the ileal pouch mucosa over time, and even carcinoma in the pouch has been reported. Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence, nature, and etiology of ileal pouch and nonpouch adenomas and carcinoma in patients with FAP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 31 FAP patients with Kock's continent ileostomy (Kock; n = 8), ileorectal anastomosis (IRA; n = 7), and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) (n = 16). All patients were followed with a standardized protocol including chromoendoscopy and biopsies of visible polyps in the ileal pouch and nonpouch mucosa. RESULTS: Sixteen of 24 pouch patients (Kock and IPAA) developed adenomas in the ileal pouch mucosa, and all patients with IRA developed adenomas in the rectal mucosa. The prevalence of ileal adenomas was significantly higher in pouch patients than in IRA patients (P = 0.002). Only one patient with Kock showed adenoma in the prepouch area. Two cases of adenocarcinomas and one case of advanced adenoma were found in the ileal pouch mucosa. CONCLUSION: Our results show a high frequency of adenomas in the ileal pouch mucosa, with evolution into carcinoma in some patients. Regular endoscopic surveillance of the pouch is recommended at a frequency similar to that for the rectal mucosa after IRA in pouch patients with FAP.",M2
19331226,"Initial results of colorectal polyposis research in Latvia.AIM: Patients suffering from colorectal polyps are more likely to develop a malignant condition with poor prognosis. The aim of the study is to investigate clinical and molecular features of colorectal polyposis syndromes in Latvia in order to offer and provide predictive genetic testing for the affected families, as well as to evaluate the frequency of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) in Latvia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six polyposis patients along with three of their relatives were included in this study. Two patients were selected from the colorectal cancer database (from a total of 2,552), and four patients not affected with colorectal cancer (CRC) were referred from the endoscopic facility of our hospital. All the patients were examined during the period from January 1st, 2000 until June 30th, 2007. Clinical data, histological examinations and family cancer histories of the respective patients were evaluated. Screening for germline APC mutations was performed in five patients and their relatives. In addition, all patients underwent genetic counseling. RESULTS: Two patients out of 2,552 from the CRC Hereditary Cancer Institute database fulfilled the clinical criteria for FAP. Thus, the frequency of FAP is 0.08% (2/2,552) of all CRC cases, and comprises approximately 0.0003% of the population of Latvia (7/22 million inhabitants). Unknown polyposis was identified in two cases. Pathogenic APC gene mutations were detected in five out of seven examined patients and their relatives. Two of the mutations (c.3942delG:p.Arg1314SerfsX7 and c.3286C &gt; T;p.Gln1096X) are novel. CONCLUSION: In this study, we report the first four APC mutation-positive FAP cases in Latvia. The present frequency of FAP is lower than that reported in Finland, Lithuania, and other neighbouring countries, but the numbers might increase if a more systematic identification approach is used. Initial molecular examinations reveal partially unique spectrum of APC gene mutations.",M2
19300275,"Faecal M2-pyruvate kinase: a novel, noninvasive marker of ileal pouch inflammation.BACKGROUND: Dimeric M2-pyruvate kinase (dM2-PK) is overexpressed in tumour cells with rapid cell turnover. Its concentrations correlate well with the staging and metastatic capability of the tumour cells. We investigated the use of faecal dM2-PK as a noninvasive marker of pouch inflammation (pouchitis) in patients having undergone restorative proctocolectomy. METHODS: Stool samples were obtained from 46 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and eight with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. Pouchitis was defined using the objective pouchitis score (OPS) and the pouch disease activity index. Faecal dM2-PK was measured using a quantitative sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay (ScheBo Biotech UK) and the results compared with reciprocal faecal calprotectin concentrations. RESULTS: Using the OPS, 6 of the 46 patients with UC had pouchitis and prepouch ileitis, 13 had UC pouchitis alone, and 27 had a non-inflamed UC pouch. One patient with familial adenomatous polyposis had pouchitis and prepouch ileitis and 7 had an non inflamed pouch. Respective median dM2-PK values (U/ml) for these five groups were 49.5 (4.5-110), 12 (1-192.3), 2.2 (0.1-95.2), 19.5 and 1 (0.1-3). Statistically significant differences were noted between inflamed and non inflamed pouches (P&lt;0.0001). dM2-PK correlated significantly with the OPS, pouch disease activity index, endoscopic appearances, acute histological and neutrophil scores (&lt;0.0001). The receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 70.6%, respectively. dM2-PK and faecal calprotectin concentrations correlated closely (r=0.87, P&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that faecal dM2-PK is a sensitive marker of pouch inflammation and that its concentration directly correlates with the objective markers of pouchitis severity.",M2
19288049,"Hepatocellular adenoma in a male with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> coli.Hepatocellular adenoma (HA) is a benign liver tumor most frequently occurring in young women using oral contraceptives. We report a rare case of HA in a 27-year-old male patient with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The patient underwent a total colectomy and ileo-rectal anastomosis for FAP in 2003. A preoperative computed tomography scan of the abdomen disclosed a tumor in the left-lobe of the liver, 5.8 cm in diameter. Pathologic examination of a needle biopsy disclosed HA, but he had never used anabolic steroids or other known inducers of HA. The size of the liver mass gradually increased to 8.5 cm during a follow-up period of 38 months, and a left hepatectomy was performed in 2006. Pathology of the resected specimen confirmed the diagnosis of HA. Although FAP is known to be complicated with neoplasia in various extracolonic organs, only five reported cases of HA have developed in patients with FAP, including this case.

19281862,"Features of duodenal cancer in patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Most patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) develop duodenal adenomas; duodenal cancer is a major cause of mortality in this patient group. We reviewed cases of duodenal cancer in patients with FAP to identify factors that determine long-term cancer risk. METHODS: Twenty FAP patients (12 male) were identified from a registry database search. Data from registry and medical notes and endoscopic and histopathologic reports were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the cancers that developed in these patients, 11 were ampullary and 9 were duodenal. The median age at cancer diagnosis was 53 years. Seventeen patients died (median age at death, 57 y; median survival from diagnosis, 11 mo); the cause of death was metastatic or duodenal/ampullary cancer in 14 patients. Fifteen patients presented symptomatically (including 3 interval cancers while on surveillance). Two were diagnosed at surveillance and 3 were diagnosed during surgery performed for endoscopic features of advanced benign disease. Duodenal cancers were associated with a significantly lower mean colonic polyp count than ampullary cancers (496 +/- 282 vs 1322 +/- 735; P = .025); there appeared to be familial clustering of this cancer. When endoscopic data were available (n = 11 of 20), all ampullary cancers arose from ampullas greater than 1 cm. The Spigelman stage did not predict risk of ampullary cancer but did predict duodenal cancer (median stage 2 vs stage 4 for duodenal cancer). CONCLUSIONS: Once cancer arises in patients with FAP, prognosis is poor, so cancer prevention should be the main goal. Surveillance intervals should reflect both Spigelman staging and ampullary disease.",M2
19267112,"Pancreaticoduodenectomy for dysplastic duodenal adenoma in a patient with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.Colorectal polyposis is the main feature of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), but benign and malignant lesions have also been described in the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, biliary tract and pancreas. There are few reports on FAP patients with duodenal polyps that developed at a younger age and even fewer on cases with dysplastic degeneration. The progression to carcinoma usually presents quite late in the clinical history of FAP patients, typically at least 20 to 25 years after proctocolectomy. This report described the rare case of a patient presenting with duodenal adenomas with dysplastic changes and tumor infiltration as the first sign of FAP, who was treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy followed by proctocolectomy for subsequent dysplastic changes in colonic polyps.",M2

19258188,"Hereditary colorectal cancer: MYH-associated polyposis and other newly identified disorders.Historically, discussions of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer have dominated lectures and writings on hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer. In the last decade, the subject has grown well beyond the two entities. In this paper, five topics relevant to genetic risk assessment for colorectal cancer are reviewed. These include the autosomal recessive MYH-associated polyposis, hyperplastic polyposis and serrated pathway syndrome, the association of autosomal dominant juvenile polyposis with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, familial colorectal cancer type X, and the syndrome of biallelic DNA mismatch repair gene mutations. Knowledge of these entities may assist clinicians to recognize and manage cases that do not fit into the more common syndromes of colorectal cancer predisposition.",M2

19148798,"Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer in Japan: a brief introduction to current clinical trials.The rapidly increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in Japan poses a great challenge to researchers to develop preventive strategies against this disease. Thus far, several clinical trials for this purpose have been planned in Japanese subjects; some have been completed and documented while others are still ongoing. Also, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan recognizes the significance of cancer prevention studies, especially against colorectal cancer, including it as one of the pillars in the  Third Research Project on General Strategies against Cancer  and funding several large-scale projects. Among them are two chemoprevention studies currently being performed: in patients with previous sporadic colorectal tumors (J-CAPP study) and in patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (J-FAPP study II). Both are double-blind randomized controlled trials with low-dose aspirin (100 mg/day), which is generally considered to be safe for long-term use. This article outlines relevant past clinical data and gives a brief introduction to these two studies.",M2
19148797,"NSAIDs and colorectal cancer prevention.This article discusses the merits and limits of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, for colorectal cancer prevention. The suppressive effect of NSAIDs on colorectal tumors has been recognized since as early as 1981. The chemopreventive effect of NSAIDs on colorectal tumors in relationship to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is reviewed first. Then, the results of a randomized double-blind clinical test that examined the regressive effect of a COX-2-specific inhibitor on adenoma of <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) are presented. Other similar trials are also reviewed. The clinical guideline for the use of aspirin, NSAIDs, and COX-2 inhibitors for primary prevention of colorectal cancer that was prepared for the U.S Preventive Services Task Force is introduced. These results suggest that a higher dose of COX-2 inhibitors has a suppressive effect on adenoma of the colon and rectum, although a moderate clinical dose of COX-2 inhibitors does not induce clinically effective suppression of adenoma. In the future, NSAIDs may be tried in combination with other materials to prevent colorectal cancer.",M2
19175647,"Restorative proctocolectomy. Does ethnicity affect outcome?OBJECTIVE: Restorative proctocolectomy (RPC) with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is well-established in the management of ulcerative colitis (UC) and <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP). We review outcome of pouch surgery from a single centre, comparing non-South Asian and South Asian Caucasian populations. METHOD: Patients undergoing RPC for UC and FAP during a 10-year period between January 1997 and January 2007 were identified from hospital records. Data were collected retrospectively from case notes on early and long-term results. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients underwent pouch formation for UC (94%) or FAP (6%) and 22 (21%) were from the Asian subcontinent. Eighty-seven (81%) underwent a three-stage procedure and 20 (19%) a two-stage procedure. Postoperative complications occurred in 40 (37%) patients, being major in 11 (10%) patients with relaparotomy required in 9 (8%) with no difference between South Asian and non-South Asian Caucasian patients. Long-term pouch function, with a median of five times over 24 h (range 2-15), was similar between the two groups. The incidence of pouchitis was 57 (53%) and this was significantly greater in the South Asian population [17/21 (77%); 39/86 (46%); P = 0.006]. CONCLUSION: Surgical results were similar in South Asian and non-South Asian Caucasian patients, but the incidence of pouchitis was greater in the former group.",M2
19174785,"RUNX3 inactivation in colorectal polyps arising through different pathways of colonic carcinogenesis.OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that RUNX3 inactivation by promoter hypermethylation in colorectal polyps is an early molecular event in colorectal carcinogenesis. METHODS: RUNX3 protein expression was analyzed immunohistochemically in 50 sporadic colorectal polyps comprising 19 hyperplastic polyps (HPs), 14 traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs), and 17 sporadic traditional adenomas (sTAs) as well as in 19 <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) samples from 10 patients showing aberrant crypt foci (ACF) (n=91), small adenomas (SmAds) (n=40), and large adenomas (LAds) (n=13). In addition, we assessed the frequency of promoter hypermethylation of RUNX3 by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in all the 50 sporadic polyps as well as 38 microdissected FAP polyps comprising ACF, SmAds, and LAds obtained from 7 FAP samples. A total of 12 normal colon samples were also included for RUNX3 MSP analysis. RESULTS: Compared to normal colon (2 of 12, 16%) and sTAs (3 of 17, 18%), HPs (15 of 19, 79%) and TSAs (8 of 14, 57%) displayed significant inactivation of RUNX3 (P&lt;0.05). In FAP, RUNX3 inactivation was more frequently seen in ACF (78 of 91, 86%), SmAds (25 of 40, 62%), and LAds (6 of 13, 46%) compared to normal mucosa (0 of 19, 0%) in the same samples (all P&lt;0.05). Promoter hypermethylation of RUNX3 was significantly higher in colorectal polyps (64 of 87, 74%) compared to normal colon (2 of 12, 16%) (P=0.001). Serrated polyps such as HPs (17 of 19, 89%) and TSAs (12 of 14, 86%) were significantly more methylated than sTAs (7 of 17, 44%) (P=0.004). RUNX3 hypermethylation was observed in 28 of the total 38 (74%) FAP polyps. Overall, RUNX3 promoter methylation correlated with inactivation of RUNX3 expression in sporadic (27 of 36, 75%) (P=0.022) and FAP (21 of 28, 75%) (P=0.021) polyps. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that RUNX3 inactivation due to promoter hypermethylation in colorectal polyps represents an early event in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. In addition, epigenetic RUNX3 inactivation is a frequent event in the serrated colonic polyps as well as in the ACF of FAP polyps.",M2

The ileal pouch anastomosed with anal spincters replaces the function of the excised colon and enables the natural rout of intestinal contents.

19160273,"Open versus laparoscopic (assisted) ileo pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis and <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>.BACKGROUND: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileo pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the main surgical treatment for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). With the advancements of minimal-invasive surgery this demanding operation is increasingly being performed laparoscopically. Therefore, the presumed benefits of the laparoscopic approach need to be systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of laparoscopic versus open IPAA for patients with UC and FAP. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialized Trial Register (April 2007), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1990 to April 2007), EMBASE (1990 to April 2007), ISI Web of Knowledge (1990 to April 2007) and the web casts of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) (up to 2006) for all trials comparing open versus laparoscopic IPAA. SELECTION CRITERIA: All trials in patients with UC or FAP comparing any kind of laparoscopic IPAA versus open IPAA. No language limitations were applied. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently performed selection of trials and data extraction. The methodological quality of all included trials was evaluated to assess bias risk. Analysis of RCTs and non-RCTs was performed separately. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Authors were requested additional information in case of missing data. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed if appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials included 607 patients of whom 253 (41%) in the laparoscopic IPAA group. Only one of the included trials was a randomised controlled trial. There were no significant differences in mortality or complications between the two groups. Reoperation and readmission rates were not significantly different. Operative time was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group both in the RCT and meta-analysis of non-RCTs (weighted mean difference (WMD) 91 minutes; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 53 to 130). There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding postoperative recovery parameters. Total incision length was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group, while two trials evaluating cosmesis found significantly higher cosmesis scores in the laparoscopic group. Other long-term outcomes were poorly reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic IPAA is a feasible and safe procedure. Short-term advantages of the laparoscopic approach seem to be limited and their clinical significance is arguable. Large high-quality trials focusing on differences regarding specific postoperative complications, cosmesis, quality of life and costs are needed.",M2
19142564,"Serum nutrients and habitual dietary intake in colectomized FAP patients in Norway.BACKGROUND: Patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) are colectomized in young age in order to avoid development of colorectal cancer. Because colectomy radically changes gastrointestinal physiology, and food avoidance may be present, colectomized patients may be at risk for nutritional deficiency. AIM OF THE STUDY: to evaluate: (1) serum biochemical levels as compared to reference; (2) dietary intake as compared to the recommendations. METHODS: Blood samples, interviews and food frequency questionnaire were collected from 38 colectomized FAP patients with duodenal adenomas (mean age 40 years, range: 24-70). They were recruited from the Norwegian database on FAP. RESULTS: Serum albumin was significantly higher (P &lt; or = 0.0001), and Mg (P = 0.02), ferritin (P &lt; or = 0.001), and cholesterol (P = 0.03) significantly lower, than reference levels. Compared to recommendations, a low intake was seen for folate and fiber (&lt;50%), iron, thiamin, riboflavin (&lt; 25%), and omega-3 fatty acids (8%). Sugar intake exceeded the recommendation, mainly due to a high intake of soft drinks. Food avoidance was reported by 53%. CONCLUSIONS: We would suggest that the nutrient intake among FAP patients should at least meet the recommendations for healthy subjects. Their risk of metachronous cancers should also cause special attention to dietary factors that may prevent nutritional deficiency and carcinogenesis.",M2
19139006,"Identification of mucin depleted foci in the human colon.Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) originally described in rodents treated with colon-specific carcinogens have been identified also in humans at high risk of colon cancer (CRC) and are extensively used as cancer biomarkers. However, studies documenting the heterogeneity of ACF have questioned their precancerous nature. Recently, we described dysplastic foci depleted of mucins (MDF) in the colon of rats treated with colon-specific carcinogens. Like colon tumors, MDFs show activation of Wnt signaling driven by mutations in the beta-catenin gene and Apc, a key gene in colorectal carcinogenesis. Because MDFs have been identified thus far only in rodents, we wanted to search for similar lesions in humans. <e>Familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) subjects, carrying germ-line mutations in the APC gene, are at high risk of CRC. Therefore, we first searched for MDF-like lesions in unsectioned colon samples from FAP patients and then in patients with sporadic CRC. MDFs were present in the colon of FAP patients (average of 0.0577 lesions/cm(2)) and at a much lower density in CRC patients (average of 0.0006 lesions/cm(2)). ACFs were also observed in all patients. Histologic preparations of all the MDFs identified in FAP and CRC consisted of microadenomas at variable grades of dysplasia. The occurrence of MDF-like lesions in high-risk patients provides evidence that these lesions have a counterpart in human pathology and, as observed in rodents, may represent the very early stages of CRC.",M2

MATERIAL AND METHODS: FAP group consisted of 15 patients with mutation of APC gene, HNPCC group consisted of 30 patients with mutation of MSH2 or MLH1 genes. Control groups consisted of 15 and 30 patients matched by a ratio of 1:1 in relation with age and sex. Examination included: history, physical examination (extra- and intraoral) and assessment of panoramic view. DMF index, OHI-S index, clinical and radiologic PI index, occlusion and presence of pathologic dental abrasion and parafunctions were assessed in intraoral examination. RESULTS: The results are presented in figures and tables. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The kind and frequency of dental anomalies is comparable with changes typical to Polish population. 2. Osseus changes like osteomas, DBI's, hazy sclerosis and dental changes like supernumerary and impacted teeth are typical for patients with FAP. The frequency and appearance of this changes is higher than in general population. 3. Knowledge of kind and frequency of dental abnormalities may help in diagnosis and prevention of hereditary colon cancer by dentists.",M2

The angioinvasive neoplasm combined a mixture of trabecular, solid, cribriform, and follicular patterns of growth with CD10+ morules. Follicles were devoid of colloid, and the nuclear features typical of PTC were present in some areas and missing in others. Tumor cells were positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 and, in 40% of the tumoral mass, also were positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin and were negative for thyroglobulin and calcitonin. Strong nuclear staining for beta-catenin was found in all tumor cells, as was positivity for p53 and cyclin D1. In addition to the germline heterozygous APC Ex 2-3 duplication mutation, a somatic homozygous silent p. Thr1493Thr gene variant was found in the neoplastic cells along with RET/PTC rearrangement. This tumor represents the first case of C-MV of PTC showing neuroendocrine differentiation.",M2
19089514,"Validation of an English version of the Padova quality of life instrument to assess quality of life following ileal pouch anal anastomosis.OBJECTIVE: Ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the procedure of choice for most patients requiring surgery for ulcerative colitis and <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> because of its perceived improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQL). The aims of this cross-sectional study were to validate an English version of the Padova Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality of Life questionnaire (PIBDQL) in patients undergoing IPAA and to investigate the pre- and postoperative predictors of long-term HRQL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In May 2005, the English version of the PIBDQL, Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, and the SF-36 were mailed to 1,379 patients who underwent IPAA at the Mount Sinai Hospital between 1982 and 2004. The test-retest reliability, internal consistency, construct validity, and discriminative ability of the English version of the PIBDQL were assessed. RESULTS: Nine hundred fifty-five patients (69%) (475 female, 480 male; mean, age 43 years) returned the questionnaires. The mean PIBDQL score was 21.1 (3.4), suggesting good quality of life. Test-retest reliability [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.784] and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83) were good. Construct validity and discriminative ability of the English version of PIBDQL were adequate. Multivariate analysis revealed that women (p &lt; 0.01) and Crohn's disease patients (p &lt; 0.01) had significantly worse PIBDQL scores. CONCLUSIONS: The English version PIBDQL is a reliable and valid disease-specific instrument for assessing quality of life in patients with IPAA. In this series, female gender and CD were significant predictors of worse HRQL.",M2
19069698,"The management of desmoids in patients with <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP).Desmoids are rare in the general population but occurs in between 10 to 20% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). This risk is about 852 times the risk for the population at large. Desmoids are benign neoplasms that are capable of infiltrating locally with a high risk of recurrence (25-65%) even after extirpating surgery. Desmoids in FAP may occur extra-abdominally, or within the abdominal wall or most commonly intra-abdominally within the mesentery or retroperitoneal. Desmoids are a major problem in patients with FAP. Mortality from desmoids is high in such patients and ranges from 18 to 31%, compared to peri-ampullary carcinomas at about 22% and cancer in the retained rectum at only about 8%. Simple drug treatment with tamoxifen or NSAIDS like sulindac should be used as first line treatment as it carries a response in 30-50% of patients. Surgery should be reserved for extra-abdominal tumours alone and only when needed. Surgery for intra-abdominal desmoids should really only be attempted for intestinal obstruction or ureteric obstruction. Dacarbazine-Doxorubicin chemotherapy may have dramatic response in some cases. Genetic transfer may unlock this disease in future and may give patients with FAP and severe desmoids hope for the future.",M2
19027515,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma and <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> of the colon.OBJECTIVE: Case report and limited review of the literature on the topic of papillary thyroid carcinoma and familial adenomatous polyposis and its genetic associations. METHODS: A patient with multiple prior surgeries for colonic polyps, abdominal perineal resection for colorectal cancer, and wedge resection for metastatic adenocarcinoma (consistent with rectal primary) presented with a thyroid mass. Fine-needle aspiration demonstrated papillary thyroid carcinoma. RESULTS: The patient underwent total thyroidectomy. Pathologic examination revealed the cribriform-morular variant of papillary carcinoma that has been reported in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. CONCLUSIONS: Cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma is an uncommon diagnosis known to be associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. Although the incidence is rare, this diagnosis should raise the clinician's suspicions to recommend both colorectal screening and genetic counseling for family members.",M2
19124115,"Increased cyclooxygenase-2 expression in juvenile polyposis syndrome.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Gastrointestinal juvenile polyps may occur in juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) or sporadically. JPS is an autosomal-dominant condition caused by a germline defect in SMAD4 or BMPR1A in 50% to 60% of cases, and is characterized by multiple juvenile polyps, predominantly in the colorectum. JPS has an increased risk of gastrointestinal malignancy but sporadic juvenile polyps do not. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is increased in gastrointestinal tumorigenesis and <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e>. Inhibition of COX-2 leads to regression of colorectal adenomas in familial adenomatous polyposis patients and inhibits gastrointestinal tumorigenesis. To investigate the role of COX-2 in juvenile polyps, we compared the expression of COX-2 in juvenile polyps from a well-defined group of juvenile polyposis patients and sporadic juvenile polyps. METHODS: COX-2 expression was assessed in 24 genetically well-defined JPS patients and 26 patients with sporadic juvenile polyps using tissue microarray analysis. Two additional markers, Hu-antigen R, a stabilizer of messenger RNA, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta, a transcription factor, both associated with increased COX-2 expression, also were investigated. RESULTS: Increased COX-2 expression in JPS patients was noted compared with patients with sporadic juvenile polyps (P &lt; .001). Also, JPS patients with a BMPR1A germline defect had higher COX-2 expression than did JPS patients in whom no germline mutation was detected. High COX-2 levels correlated with increased cytoplasmic Hu-antigen R expression in JPS polyps (P = .022), but not in sporadic juvenile polyps. CONCLUSIONS: Juvenile polyposis and sporadic juvenile polyps show distinctive expression profiles of COX-2 that may have clinical implications.",M2
19111562,"A missense mutation in the APC tumor suppressor gene disrupts an ASF/SF2 splicing enhancer motif and causes pathogenic skipping of exon 14.A missense mutation at codon 640 in the APC gene was identified in a <e>familial adenomatous polyposis</e> (FAP) patient, however, its pathological consequence remained unclear. Here we found that this missense mutation interferes at the nucleotide level with an exonic splicing regulatory element and leads to aberrant splicing of the mutant APC transcript rather than exerting its effect through the observed amino acid change. Analysis of the patient RNA revealed complete skipping of exon 14 in transcripts from the mutant APC allele, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon. When cloned into a splicing reporter minigene and transfected into colorectal cell lines, the exon 14 point mutation c.1918C&gt;G (pR640G) was found sufficient to cause the observed exon skipping. Bioinformatic analysis predicted the mutation to change SRp55, hnRNP A1 or ASF/SF2 splicing factor binding sites. Using RNA interference methodology these predictions were experimentally validated and revealed that only ASF/SF2 was required for exon 14 inclusion. These research data identify APC mutation c.1918C&gt;G (pR640G) as pathogenic and indicate a mechanism involving disruption of an ASF/SF2 exonic splicing enhancer element. The results allow genetic diagnosis of a hereditary tumour predisposition but also illustrate the need to complement in silico prediction by splicing reporter assays.",M2
